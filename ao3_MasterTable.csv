Encourages it really, because people need an outlet for their anger, and Lance has always been the best at making people angry at him.</p>
<p>(And if his heart twinges a little every time he has to let someone be particularly mean to him, then he just has to remember that this is what he's good at. What he's good for.) </p>
<p>But Lance is an older brother, and an uncle, and a younger brother. He learned sometimes keeping people means sacrificing his own feelings for a bit. He's been taught that he can't always let his feelings take a back seat though. After all, what happens if the rock falls apart? </p>
<p>So, while Lance is always prepared to be the enemy on any given day, there are certain days and certain things that he will not let fly.</p>
<p>Or, </p>
<p>What happens when Lance is sick of his teammate's shit.</p>
<p>“Did something happen between you and him?” Hunk knows that Pidge was working on something, and he knows how Lance can be. Maybe she snapped and his friend’s off licking his wounds somewhere. Or maybe Lance was already upset and she snapped and he’s off licking his wounds somewhere. Not doing much to help the image of his friend curled up in a ball.</p>
<p>“Ok I know you miss your mom or whatever, but that doesn't mean you can just act like her to us. She isn't here Lance, don't be a baby about it.”</p>
<p>It's the wrong thing to say. In any situation or circumstance, Keith is wrong to say something like that. He realizes this right after the words leave his mouth.</p>
<p>And even if Keith didn't have the awareness to realizes it himself, Lance's positively thunderous expression would have given it away.</p>
<p>“Why do you have my laptop?” Pidge questions, “did you see Lance?”</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Hunk's eyes widen as Keith flinches and nods.</p>
<p>“Keith no,” Hunk groans.</p>
<p>Lance flinches, and his face goes red. There's silence as they stare each other down. Shiro's just about to lose his cool, the image of Keith in tears just there, when the blue paladin finally responds.</p>
<p>“Your bias is showing.”</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>“What!?” Shiro asks, just a bit outraged.</p>
<p>“Your bias. It's showing.”</p>
<p>“Is Lance in his room?” He and Allura don't make a habit of stepping into the paladin's business if it does not directly affect Voltron. Their understanding of the human psyche and customs are still far too limited, and they often end up making a dispute worse. But Shiro needs help. Lance needs help. They all need help.</p>
<p>“I honestly don't know,” Lance finally mutters, voice bitter and annoyed. “It's been a bad day.”</p>
<p>Excuses! She's so sick of excuses!</p>
<p>“A bad day is no excuse to fall apart as a team!” She means the words for everyone, but stares at Lance. This all revolves around him. What has the boy done now?</p>
<p>Lance turns to look at her, face finally showing some emotion other than the steady annoyance he's been portraying. He looks shocked. Why does he look shocked?</p>
<p>“You're not seriously about to blame me for what just went down,” he asks breathlessly, “are you?”</p>
<p>“Shiro,” the princess murmurs, “please step aside.”</p>
<p>Her voice is soft, and Coran imagines that she has to be quite shocked about what just happened. He is not doing much better himself. </p>
<p>“No,” Shiro shakes his head, “I won't.”</p>
<p>“Promise us,” Pamela insisted, “that you’ll stand up for yourself more?”</p>
<p>“I know you like to take things on your shoulders because it makes you feel good,” Lisandra added, “but you can only do that if you’re in good health. So you can’t let others put you down like that.”</p>
<p>“Ok?” Arturio had ran a hand through Lance’s hair, “Alejandro?”</p>
<p>It took a moment, but Lance had eventually nodded, ready to take on this new challenge.</p>
<p>“Si.”</p>
<p>“I do think it's worth it to speak to your fellow paladins though,” Coran continues calmly, “on your own time, of course.”</p>
<p>Lance nods. He's glad Coran is here. He never knows how much he misses having an adult in his corner until the advisor pops up out of nowhere when Lance needs it. And he knows what's not being said. Hunk will be content if Lance wants to avoid the other paladins for another whole week, but Coran understands that it's impossible. They're defenders of the universe, and their ability to do that job literally relies on them being on speaking terms at the very least. </p>
<p>Lance accepts the jar from Coran's hands. His own are much more steady now.</p>
<p>The advisor will never push Lance into talking to the others, but won't let Lance forget that he's going to need to eventually either. The blue paladin appreciates that.</p>
<p>Lance sighs, putting down his application brush and standing. Looks like it's happening sooner rather than later. He schools his face into a blank expression, and walks over to open the door.</p>
<p>“Hello Lance.”</p>
<p>It's Allura.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>“I want to forgive you though,” Lance admits, “I want us to be ok. I don’t like being mad at you Shiro, it makes me feel gross. So…”</p>
<p>The blue paladin moves and leans back against his room door, sliding down until he’s sitting directly across from the leader.</p>
<p>“Let’s have it then.”</p>","<p>Hey hey hey!</p>
<p>Naturally, I don't own anything, but I just have to say that my favorite character of Voltron is indeed Lance, and while I adore how the show has gone so far for the most part, I can't help but think of some of the great potentials for characterization (ahem, LanceHunkCoran) that it's glossed over. So this is basically a self-indulgent mini-fic exploring one of my favorite headcanons that I wish other people would go into more: that Lance has a very scary temper. He's a family man, after all, and people who are all about that family life must have semblance of how to deal with people being disrespectful, especially if we go with the idea that Lance has younger siblings he's helped raise. </p>
<p>A quick warning though, this fic does get into some rather steep self-deprecation territory.</p>
<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_1_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I'm just going to explore all my headcanons with this one lol.<br>I feel as though Lance is smart. Like, actually smart. I don't think he would have been selected to be the leader of two tech prodigies at the garrison if he couldn't at least keep up with them a little bit. It only makes sense that he picked up a few things, and if there's one thing that I actually do dislike about his characterization in the show, it's how ridiculously stupid they make him come off as sometimes (season two, I'm looking at you), especially considering he's shown to be quite capable and competent at other times.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't plan on this fic being very long, it's mainly to get my ideas out and to actually introduce myself to writing Voltron fics, but I have a plot planned out for this, and I hope to get it wrapped up within a few weeks or so.</p>
<p>Wow. The response so far for this is just overwhelming really T.T I'm so glad that people are enjoying this and taking to the idea. I've planned it out and it's looking like this is going to be about 8 chapters. This one is rather short, unfortunately, but I want them to be separate in that they focus on different character relations. This mainly acts as setup for the next chapter and a focus on the role Hunk is going to play in this story.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Like I said, it's short. But don't fret! The next chapter is actually almost complete and should go up sometime within the next two days. See y'all then!</p>
<p>Another chapter so soon? Hahaha this one just flowed right out of me. Fair warning, Keith is kind of mean in this, but he's not meant to be an antagonist or anything.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Like I said, Keith isn't meant to have a nasty characterization, neither is Pidge for that matter. No one is, and I hope I did a well enough job framing exactly why Keith thought it would be appropriate to push Lance like this. I was trying to impart the idea that Keith only really knows how to interact with Lance on Lance's terms, or what he thinks Lance's terms are. He didn't go into this interaction wanting to hurt Lance's feelings, he went into expecting Lance keep up the dynamic that Keith believes they are both most comfortable with. All anyone is guilty of in this fic is not learning Lance well enough past the superficial, and these interactions are meant to be a ""what if Lance gets tired of people not learning him well enough?""</p>
<p>Anyways, please anticipate some more updates in the near future, and any feedback is appreciated!</p>
<p>So another super short Hunk-aside. These are really meant to be breaks in between the angst honestly, and to show that Hunk is in fact aware and informed of the situation.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Lance is my favorite character, but I actually love them all hahaha. One of my favorite things to see is some Hunk-any other paladin interaction because I feel like he cares so much, just like Lance. They both show it in different ways, but they are no doubt the legs of Voltron.</p>
<p>Double Update! Hahaha I'm so into writing this that I've been working on it little by little during most of my free time.<br>Fair warning, there be angst in this chapter, Shiro stans beware, he kind of drops the ball here. I was actually a bit leery about this one, but all will be explained in the end notes.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So just in case there's any confusion, this fic does in fact take place all in one day, which is why Lance's reactions are getting progressively more intense. I hope my backstory building isn't too confusing or ridiculous, I'm trying to set up a sensible timeline wherein Lance has actually been withdrawn for the past week leading up this story, only really talking to Hunk in his free time and only interacting with others when they're as a group. </p>
<p>There are no antagonists here, just misunderstandings rampant. To me, Shiro does not know Lance and Hunk nearly as much as he knows Keith or Pidge, and while he cares about all of them, he's operating under assumptions here that he would not have made if he knew Lace better. Pidge is only half coherent here, and that's why she isn't telling Shiro the full story behind Lance's outbursts, but Shiro trusts that Pidge is coherent enough. He's just being protective bro mode here hahaha, and what he thinks are Lance's various ""tells"" are what leads him to think that Lance was in the wrong here. The only one who has experience dealing with Lance at his worst and his most fed up in this story is Hunk. Shiro is recognizes signs, just connecting them wrong.</p>
<p> I do hope I did his character justice, because to me there are an incredible amount of ways Shiro can be characterized and still fit into his archetype in the show due to the layers of his backstory and the fact that we only really have hints of the type of person he was at the Garrison. Anyways. wow. This got long! See y'all next time!</p>
<p>Bam! Another chapter done.<br>Can I just say that the response to this is so overwhelming great!? I read every comment and I love every comment hahaha. That being said, I'm probably going to put off personally responding to each comment until about the end of this story. I'm so glad people are appreciating the characterization though! That's what I'm most focused one when I write.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So, Coran is going to play a similar role as Hunk in this story. I can tell you right now that he won't be upsetting Lance during this storyline. I'm trying to make the confrontations as realistic based on the characters presented as possible, and I just don't see any scenario where Coran would push Lance's buttons like the others have been, even over a misunderstanding. Coran just doesn't have that type of character, add that to the fact that he seems to favor Lance sometimes. So, there will be no yelling at the space uncle hahaha.</p>
<p>Psst.<br>Surprise.<br>Another double update hahaha.<br>This one gave me feels to write honestly, and once I started I really couldn't stop. So without further ado, enjoy the chapter! Be warned, their be sad and angry feels abundant in this chapter.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So. Allura.<br>My personal headcanon is that she does not actually spend much time with the paladins outside of training, missions and meals maybe. She's leading a team to save the universe. The stakes are ridiculously high for her. Allura strikes me as very militant leader, and the idea that her paladins might not be prepared for anything really riles her up. Voltron: Legendary Defender, is made to be appropriate for kids, but if it had a higher rating, I've always thought that Allura would be much harder on the paladins than she's shown as being on the show. Here, she's just trying to protect them in her own. She doesn't understand why they're falling apart before her eyes, but she knows that it has a lot to with Lance. So Lance is the one she calls out, and he finally has his impending breakdown. I imagine watching someone you care about literally lose all of their shit can be quite disarming, so that's why no one intervenes. Had it gone on for much longer, they probably would have, but the interaction is over too fast. </p>
<p>We're wrapping things up with this story, the next few chapters will have Hunk and Coran working overdrive to fix up this mess, and attempts at apologizing. It may take a bit longer to get them out, because the one I'm working on at the time of this note is turning out to be quite long lol, but I hope it will be worth it! Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p>Er, surprise?<br>Lol I know I said an update might take a few days, but upon further reviewing, I decided to break this part off and make it into a singular chapter, just in trying to follow the narrative style I've developed for this story. So...enjoy!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_8_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Headcanon: Allura runs the show and keeps them on task. Shiro leads and encourages. Keith gets shit done. Pidge innovates and makes it possible for things to get done. Hunk fixes when thing's are broken or slowing down (people include naturally). Lance supports, just constantly in his own ways. And Coran helps everyone do their own individual thing as needed. <br>The next chapter will definitely be the longest yet lol. Why? </p>
<p>Because we'll finally be getting a full sequence from Lance's point of view. So anticipate Langst and anger and feels and Hunk and Coran and just all of the things hahaha!</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to present this update to you guys lol!<br>Fair warnings, when I this fic goes into some dark self-depreciation... Well here it is. There is very very light self harm depicted here, but it's not a conscious or purposeful effort, so be mindful.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_9_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I got feelsy while writing this lol. I tried to have a realistic take on Lance's outbursts and how to connect them to the more insecure side of his character that's been alluded to. Resolutions are coming soon guys! Expect apologies and explanations and fluff coming your way soon! Headcanon: Lance's name is Alejandro...because I like it.</p>
<p>Ta-dah! Sorry this took so long lol. I really wanted to get this right with the narrative, and I debated on the perspectives to focus on for this chapter a lot. So I ended up rewriting this entire part three different times. And I eventually got to a point where I was satisfied with it. </p>
<p>Can I also just say that reading the comments have given me all sorts of life? :). I'm going to take the time and go through and reply to the ones I haven't already yet when this is complete, but just know that I do read them and I do love them, and I'm honored that so many excellent authors on here (one happens to be one of my favorites &gt;.&gt;) are enjoying my work.</p>
<p>Let the resolutions and fluff begin!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_10_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I suppose this is as good a time as any to drop the fact that this is planned to be the prologue of a plot-driven series. On the last note of this work, I will go more into detail, but just know that the plot points I've been dropping aren't random or out of nowhere lol. They're very purposeful.</p>
<p>Anyways, we have Keith and Pidge finally reconciling with Lance. I headcanon that given the opportunity, Lance or Hunk could easily end up being some of Keith's closest and most trusted friends, and I hoped that I demonstrated the dynamic I'm going for between him and Lance properly in this story. I also slipped in some of my headcanons regarding Keith and Shiro's relationship here &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>Speaking of our fearless leader, once again, I must say that there are no antagonists. The focus on Shiro as having hurt Lance's feelings more than anyone else is purely based on the situation at hand. Lance looks up to Shiro, wants to be seen as trustworthy and capable by him, so the confrontation between them in this story really grated on him. Lance doesn't expect nearly as much from Allura as he does from Shiro here, but he's even less willing to talk to her because of it. In his head, she doesn't see him as a friend, and his bond with her won't affect Voltron directly, so he has no desire to have a conversation with her just yet.</p>
<p>And Pidge. Come on, she's like a little sibling to Lance, through and through. There was no way he was going to hold a grudge against her when he knew she already felt bad and understood her error.</p>
<p>Back at it again with another update! This one's a bit shorter, but don't worry! The next chapter should be up within the next two days or so. We're wrapping things up folks! There will be one more chapter after this and perhaps a forward for a continuation! Please enjoy!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_11_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Originally, Allura and Shiro were going to share a chapter. But I decided against that. Lance and Shiro are planned to be the most central characters of the next installment in this universe, and a lot of plot focuses will go back to the conversation they're about to have, so I felt it would be appropriate for that to be it's own chapter for both that reason and the fact that Shiro really put Lance out with the whole ""rely on you"" question. Emotions are going to be high in the next one lol.</p>
<p>Now back to Allura. Here we get into a bit of how I feel she views Lance. I personally headcanon that Lance would be a difficult person for Allura to grow close to because she doesn't understand or appreciate his approach to trying to socialize with her. I think she sees him as a capable paladin, but isn't as secure with trusting him as she is with trusting everyone else, and this is also something I plan on exploring further. </p>
<p>Anyways, til next time!</p>
<p>(P.S. I'm not ignoring those who are asking about Hunk's scenario with Lance. That will be a thing.)</p>
<p>Wow. We've come full circle my peoples! I'm happy to say that I've completed my first story in the Voltron Fandom!<br>Please do enjoy. I legit teared up while writing this so I hope the emotions ring true for others as well.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_12_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Things between these two are not magically fixed lol. They've just come to an agreement onto how to go about fixing them. But like I said, Shiro and Lance will be primary characters in the plot-driven continuation of this, so expect for this interaction to be revisited. </p>
<p>It took a long of debating, but I decided on having the majority of the apology occur from Shiro's point of view. I wanted to explore just emotional I believe he'd get when presented with everything Lance is throwing at him here. Because I don't see him as a bad guy, but I do believe that he's a bit out of his depths sometimes, and it shows with the decisions he makes. I do love him though, regardless, and exploring the dynamic between him and Lance is something I wish I saw more in the fandom.</p>
<p>I debated for a long while on how to conclude this chapter, but eventually decided that something humorous was the way to go. Because come on, this is Voltron, they're all a bunch of nuts at the end of the day lol. </p>
<p>I am so overwhelmed with joy due to response to this fic and universe, all of your comments have given me life, and sometime tomorrow I will go through them all and reply to the ones I have not replied to yet. I'm glad people enjoy my writing, and that my interpretation of these wonderful characters was appreciated. Please anticipate more from me in the future!</p>
<p>Now. Because I like to be suspenseful or whatever, here's something I wrote as a forward to the continuation of this universe.</p>
<p>(“I don't see why you're so surprised,” Faraj says casually, “surely you didn't think that you all would be able to come together as one to form Voltron if you all weren't at least slightly compatible with all the lions?”</p>
<p>“I mean…” Lance murmurs. It does make sense in a way. Voltron is all five lions. All five of them. It makes sense that not having a basic connection to all of the lions would make uniting difficult.</p>
<p>“Paladins all have quintessence that mirrors their Lions, it's how the Lions choose their pilots,” Bin goes on, “however, part of the paladins quintessence has to be compatible in some way to all of the lions for you all to have formed Voltron as fast as you did.”</p>
<p>“Everyone of you paladins have a slight connection to the other Lions outside of your destined one, but you, my friend,” Faraj smiles, “you have a lot of quintessence, and the strongest balance of it.”) </p>
<p>A Hunk-focused oneshot surrounding the incident from the past should be up within the next few days, and you can expect more from the main universe in about a week, give or take! Thank you all so much!</p>
<p>I'm just going to explore all my headcanons with this one lol.<br>I feel as though Lance is smart. Like, actually smart. I don't think he would have been selected to be the leader of two tech prodigies at the garrison if he couldn't at least keep up with them a little bit. It only makes sense that he picked up a few things, and if there's one thing that I actually do dislike about his characterization in the show, it's how ridiculously stupid they make him come off as sometimes (season two, I'm looking at you), especially considering he's shown to be quite capable and competent at other times.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't plan on this fic being very long, it's mainly to get my ideas out and to actually introduce myself to writing Voltron fics, but I have a plot planned out for this, and I hope to get it wrapped up within a few weeks or so.</p>"

<p>School starts again on Monday so I'll try not to let this fall by the wayside, but unfortunately I can't make any promises.</p>
<p>Took me longer than it should have to get this chapter done, but here it is. Thanks to everyone who has read, commented and left kudos.</p>
<p>Finally a chapter, though it isn't very long. The next one should be longer now that school is over for the semester. Thanks to everyone who has read, commented and left kudos.</p>
<p>Another chapter and I apologize for the fact we seem to be getting nowhere fast, but the plot developments don't seem to be working with me. Thanks to everyone who has read, commented, and left kudos.</p>
<p>I keep hoping I'll get better at more timely updates, but I'm starting to think I'll have to keep imagining what it would be like. Anyway, thanks to everyone who has read, commented and left kudos.</p>
<p>First off, thanks to everyone for being so patient with this update. School is done so my goal is to keep the update time a little shorter than I've been managing lately. Second, big thanks for everyone who has left comments, kudos and read. Third, this chapter gets even more AU.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>This is the last chapter before things start getting more deep and hopefully longer. Thanks to anyone who has read, left kudos or a comment.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>I had originally intended for the chapter to be longer, but with the amount of coursework I have, it seemed better to update something short. With that being said, it might be awhile before this gets updated again, but never fear, for it hasn't and won't be abandoned. </p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who has read, commented and left kudos.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>I know it's been a long time, but I finally have managed to finish an update!. Thanks to everyone who has read, commented and left kudos.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>I really have no excuses for how long this took. On the upside however, I have finally managed to finish and this will be the second to last chapter, with the last one getting posted some time late next week.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has read, commented and left kudos.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>And so we've reached the end of this. Massive thanks to everyone who has read, commented, left kudos and in general stuck it out until the end. I never intended for this to take so long to finish but I value every sign people enjoyed reading this and rest assured this won't be the last thing I post.</p>
<p>Thanks again for everyone who has taken the time to read this.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>"

<p>The title stems from one of Surak’s teachings: <i>Dakh'uh pthak. Nam-tor ri ret na'fan-kitok fa tu dakh pthak. </i> -- “Cast out fear. There is no room for anything else until you cast out fear.”</p>
<p>Where I thought it necessary, I have added translations for the Golic Vulcan used in this fic at the end of each chapter. My knowledge of the Vulcan language as well as some of its culture, customs, food, etc. mostly comes from these great pages:</p>
<p>They are also the sources of most of my language definitions used in the notes of this fic. All mistakes made in implementing them into this fic/using them/changing them about to fit my purpose are my fault, though. I have also attached further notes about this story at the end of some chapters.</p>

<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p><i>kaiidth</i> = Vulcan philosophy: “What is, is.” (from <i>kya</i> = to exist)</p>
<p> Spock to Sarek: <i>Dif-tor heh smusma, osa-mekh.</i> = “Live long and prosper, honored father.” <br>Kirk to Sarek: <i>kevet-dutar</i> = Ambassador<br>  Sarek: <i>La’rom’lasha.</i> = formal: lit. “(I/we) welcome (you) here.” (Upon guests’ arrival.)<br>Kirk: <i>La’ertau sochya t’okelek</i> = formal: (if at a home) lit. “(I/we) disturb the peace of your honorable home.”</p>
<p> Kirk to Spock: <i>Wa’paitaren du.</i> = informal: “Thank you very much!” (lit. You (are) very much appreciated!)  </p>
<p><i>thas t’kheh</i> = lit. “milk of <i>kheh</i>”, whereas <i>kheh</i> is a sort of Vulcan grain; I totally made this dish up <br><i>pla-savas</i> = lit. “blue fruit”; a sweet type of Vulcan fruit <br><i>floku</i> = Vulcan equivalent of a spoon </p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p><i>osa-su</i> = gentleman/sir (literally “honored man”)<br><i>oko-su</i> = lady/madam (literally “honored woman”)</p>
<p>Reference for <i>loshirak</i> is the yoga pose <a href=""http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/486"" rel=""nofollow"">Bound Angle Pose</a>; other people have <a href=""http://syvak.wordpress.com/krakroa-whltri/"" rel=""nofollow"">likened the Vulcan <i>loshirak</i> to the Zen-Lotus pose</a>, but I liked the ‘easier’ version better, especially as it’s apparently taught to children at a young age.</p>
<p>As for planet-to-ship communication while Jim is falling towards Vulcan, I went with the inconsistency already present in the 2009 movie. It seems like Kirk is still able to communicate with the <i>Enterprise</i> as he is falling towards Vulcan with Sulu, so I reckoned we can all ignore that the comm device was much more likely to be attached to the helmet instead of the ear (and that in the latter case, it would have been invisible) to make the story work. ;)</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p><i>Orensu</i> = students<br><i>Pafam-t'san s'at.</i> = Deficient emotional control.<br><i>Ha, osavensu</i> = Yes, honored teacher.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p><i>kolinahru</i> = somebody who has mastered the discipline rigorous training program to purge oneself of all emotion</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Aaaaand we’re done. Wow. This was long (double-big bang!). I really liked playing with the idea of saving Vulcan (surely something we all wished for at some point) and how it would impact Jim and Spock and their potential relationship.</p>
<p>Big thanks to my wonderful Beta, ObsidianEmbrace, and my artist and fanmixer. :) It was a great round!</p>
<p>I really hope you enjoyed.

<p><b>Update 2023</b>: I just want to say <b>thank you</b> to all the people who have been leaving kudos and comments on this fic, even after a decade of it having been posted! This fic was my first big bang, my first long writing project that I didn't post as a WIP and it is really dear to me. I love that there suddenly seems to be renewed enthusiasm for this story.

<p>I hope you all have enjoyed this BNHA remix of Giacomo Puccini's final opera, Turandot.</p>
<p>...Yup! That was the joke! It's an opera, guys! It's an Italian romantic opera!</p>
<p>Specifically, the opera where <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTFUM4Uh_6Y"" rel=""nofollow"">this little tune</a> is from. If you don't recognize the story, you might recognize its most famous aria.</p>
<p>Now obviously, EXTREME liberties were taken, on account of all the misogyny, Orientalism, and severe protagonist-centered morality in the source material, as well as the fact that Puccini never actually finished the darned thing before he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1924. A few of you asked me if I made the riddles myself, and the answer to that is, sort of! I came up with the rhyme scheme, took elements from the original phrasing in the opera, and sort of re-wrote them. Besides that, I took an absolute shitbag of liberties with pretty much everything, and I hope Puccini's not rolling in his grave too much. Or, yaknow, maybe he was really into Orientalism and misogyny, in which case roll away, Giacomo!</p>

<p>Important Announcement</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your kind words and condolences. Maerynn's friends and loved ones, we all appreciate the tremendous amount of love that was shown through your messages and comments. Mae was an exceptional individual, and her absence has been deeply felt by those of us who talked to her regularly or read her stories. </p>
<p>With that said, I truly hope you enjoy the rest of the chapters. She did a phenomenal job writing them and put her heart and soul into the story. It was truly a blessing to be able to collaborate with her these past few months. Editing and tweaking this chapter reminded me of all the story events and dialogue we planned together and it was bittersweet to be able to reminisce. Thank you all for your support and for not pressuring me for updates.</p>
<p>A wild akuma appears!! How will Ladybug and Chat Noir defeat this time-based villain when they can't even transform?</p>
<p>Adrien and Marinette have revealed their identities to each other.... NOW WHAT?? How will this change their budding new relationship? Will they be able to feel comfortable around each other again?</p>
<p>Marinette and Adrien's time stuck together has almost come to an end: the handcuffs are about to come off and freedom is near. But what does this mean for their relationship?</p>
<p>I was commissioned to draw the cop and robber Halloween costumes mentioned in the last chapter of the fic, so I took the opportunity to write a short epilogue that Maerynn and I had originally planned on writing.</p>","<p>This is a collaboration between a writer and an artist!

</p>
<p>PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU COMMENT!</p>
<p>While we appreciate your enthusiasm when it comes to our project, you have to realize when you ask for the next update, you put unwelcome and counterproductive pressure on us.</p>
<p>We are both moms. Eden has a 5 year-old boy and a 6 year-old princess, while Maerynn has a 3 year-old little man and a 6 year-old little girl. Maerynn is working full time as a pharmacy technician, and Eden makes a living out of her commissions. Under Lock and Key is our hobby, something we do for fun and relax.</p>
<p>If it were only text, it would probably be done by now. But we chose another path, a path with awesome pictures to go with the text and show you our vision of the story, to make it feel more alive. And these things take time.</p>
<p>While we would like to update once a month, it's unrealistic. Maerynn needs about two weeks to come up with a chapter and having it beta'ed (friendly reminder that she has two others fics running, The Other You with Totally_Lucky and Bring Me Home, on top of one-shots and sporadic projects.) Eden, on her part, needs three to four weeks to do illustrations that meets her minimum quality requirements (again, friendly reminder that Eden lives of commissions, and is also doing When Duty and Desire Meet with MidnightStarlightWrites).</p>
<p>For those reasons, expecting an update once every six to eight weeks would be more realistic. We do realize it's a huge amount of time between updates, but we both want you guys to get the best we can do instead of an half-assed job.</p>
<p>Keep reading, keep commenting. We love you guys, and we're excited to share this story with you &lt;3</p>
<p>Sorry guys for the long wait! Life (and vacation) got in the way on both ends, but here it is now!</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Many of you might be wondering what will happen to ""Under Lock and Key"" with Maerynn gone. I do plan on finishing it because I believe it's what Mae would have wanted. She had already finished writing most of the remaining chapters, and I want all our readers to be able to read and enjoy all her hard work. And so I will continue to work on updating this story with the help of some of our close friends. </p>
<p>However, I ask you to please be conscientious of the grieving we're going through and understand that it may take a while to get the next chapter up. Having her leave us so suddenly has been very difficult. She was very dear to us.</p>
<p>This is not an official hiatus, just... more of a pause. A moment of silence, if you will. Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>This is the longest chapter to date, so it took me a really long time to edit/rewrite and make the illustrations. Maerynn had written most of it but it was a VERY rough draft and she hadn't been able to work on it much, so there were holes and inconsistencies that needed to be addressed, as well as dialogue changes.

<p>Edit: Here's the reference we were going off of for the akuma: https://i.imgur.com/qJ1F5gE.jpg<br>I wanted to give her a panel of her own but I had already drawn lots of pictures for this chapter so I decided I'd rather update sooner rather than (even) later.</p>
<p>So, I've been having a bit of art block for the past month or so. Everything feels harder to draw and takes me a lot longer than usual. Writing-wise, there was a lot that needed to be changed and added in the rough draft, too, so that was a challenge for me as well since I'm still new to writing fanfiction. Anyway, it's finally finished though, I hope you enjoy it!!</p>
<p>(As you may have guessed, the chapter title is a flashback to the events of chapter 2. Give it a listen while reading!)</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this one! The fluff was so strong, it gave me a couple of cavities, my dentist is gonna make a fortune! XD </p>
<p>Anyway, just one more chapter left! Can you believe it?! Updates usually happen every 6-8 weeks, so as usual, please continue to refrain from asking when the next chapter will be posted. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>This was by far the hardest chapter to finish. Thank you all for your love and support. I hope you've enjoyed this story as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>

<p>Tim wonders how much longer Bruce will let him stay, now that Jason is back. Jason still can’t be Robin, but Bruce doesn’t want Tim as Robin, anyway.

<p>Roy is smaller than he remembers, sweating and shaking and not quite conscious, deep in the throes of withdrawal. Bruce lifts him carefully, mentally cataloguing the track marks that appear when his sleeve rides up. He knew Roy was on heroin when they saw him last. He’d hoped the boy had gotten clean, but he’d suspected he was already dead, so overall this counts as a win. Hopefully Oliver Queen will see it that way, too.

<p>hello everyone! i'm really, hilariously busy, and that's my only excuse really. stories in this universe will be put on a bit of a back burner until my life gets less hectic :(</p>
<p>Salt Water Mixed With Air, my charity fic for hpficfiend, will be posted in the first week of march :)</p>
<p>so i'll have part two up tomorrow. I really did want this to be a bigger thing, but then finals happened, so there's roughly a ton of loose ends for this series that i have to clean up that i didn't manage to do here. on the list for this series is the starbucks drive through, how melissa found out, sterek from one of their student's perspective, and one or two deal with loose ends. i've gotten a few request for a supernatural crossover fic, how would you guys feel about that?<br>if you have any more prompts, feel free to drop them off at my tumblr: shanastoryteller.<br>also, one more thing. hpficfiend won me in the sterek auction, so sometime in early february keep an eye out for:<br>Salt Water Mixed With Air - Derek’s eyes are red, Peter’s are blue, his are gold, and Isaac is gone.</p>"

This is the story of how the avengers raise a young wizard, and how they teach him and each other how they all deserve the love and comfort having a family can offer.</p>","<p>Alright so this is something I've been working on for AGES and I've decided to just start posting and hope for the best. This work is inspired by another one and I've posted the link to it below. I will try and post chapters in a timely manner. sorry in advance if it's not as fast as I hope.<br>I do not own the avengers or Harry Potter.<br>Currently there is no major violence or trigger warnings but if anything changes I will post it in the tags as well as in the notes.<br>also, everything is edited by me myself and I, so all mistakes are my own.<br>I hope ya'll enjoy!</p>
<p>this may actually be nearing the end of this fic? I'm planning on the sequel being like a rewrite of year 1, and we've nearly reached that point. there may be one or two more chapters, but this fic is nearly done!! updates might be a bit slower because up until now I've had everything already written and have just been posting updates when I've stopped in at home but I'll try my best to keep things fairly speedy! <br>once again, big thank yous to everyone who's been reading/leaving kudos/leaving comments, you're what makes writing all of this worth it &lt;3<br>also, here's to introducing Fury.</p>
<p>Wow! It's finally done. I'm so sorry it took longer than expected. Life got ahead of me. It's super open ended with the conclusion cause I really really want to rewrite the whole series in this verse, but we'll see how it goes. I hope everyone reading this enjoys this final chapter. There may be quite a few mistakes as I wrote it under the influence of pain killers (I just broke my ankle whoops). </p>
<p>As with all the chapters before, the ideas are mostly mine, but the characters belong to Marvel and JK Rowling.<br>I did borrow a little more directly from Rowling in this chapter but you'll see why. </p>
<p>Thank you everyone for reading and please continue to comment!</p>"

I'm like 90% confident the next WILL be the last (but then again my track record is not the greatest - this was meant to be only 2 chapters originally haha...)</p>
<p>I really can't say when I'll post the next one, uni is super stressful and my course load is huge, but I write whenever I have some free time. Love you! (also I read all your comments but it may take me a while to reply --- and even if I don't I still appreciate and love them!!!)</p>

<p>This story has art, I can't believe it. It is amazing please give the artist lots of love.</p>
<p>(Now the original end note)</p>
<p>Know how I said in at the first note that this was easier? Forget it; it was a lot of work. Can you tell I was fed up with repeating scenes by the end of it? I was.</p>
<p>But I’m actually pretty happy with it? This grew more than I expected and I really wanted to post it on the 24th or 25th at least. Alas, it didn’t happen. But the 20th anniversary of The Sorcerer’s Stone is a good date too right? (posting date says 27th but is the freaking 26th where I'm at, wtf ao3)</p>
<p>If you got until this point thank you very much for reading and if you would please tell me what you think? I love Harry Potter so much and was never brave to really write about it. But as I said before I have another Hadric fic on the works and I would really like to know if this didn’t suck you know? Or if anyone is even interested in it.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks!</p>"

<p>“Then we should stay with him.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t a horrible idea, Derek decided reluctantly. They hadn’t been able to set up a real camp for a few weeks in the open foothills, and they were all on edge from sleeping in exposed areas. A defensible place to sleep would be good for them, even if they were surrounded by death. They would be able to give the pack proper burials, at the very least.</p>

In every movie, show, comic, etc. people flip out at the scene, which is understandable, but what happens off the scene? They probably just shake their heads and go about their days.

<p>Thank you so much for all comments/kudos/etc! they really do mean a ton, I read each and every one!</p>

<p>(also if you were wondering why Midoriya just didnt take the elevator down to his room the answer is shhhhhhhh)</p>
<p><i>Next chapter</i>: Todoroki reaches Absolute Zero of embarrassment, so much so that I as the author want to perish while writing it. Poor kid.</p>
<p>*Roblox voice* Ooef!!</p>
<p>I do have my reasons for taking so long with this, but who gives a shit lmao. All that matters is that it's finally out! I hope this is somewhat remotely satisfying, part of the reason I never updated was fear of providing a solid ending. I really wanna deliver for y'all!</p>
<p>Also, I just realized this has been a pretty smut-free fic (which is fucking unbelievable just given my history of fic writing lol), so if you don't like that sort of thing, skip from ""<i>Hell, with Todoroki's luck</i>... to ""<i>Are you alright? I'm pretty sure I smell smoke!</i>"".</p>

<p>OH WOW! I have a lot to say, feel free to skip it all!</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you so much for each and every comment. I mean that sincerely; the comments and overall response were literally the only motivation that actually got me to finish this sonuvabitch. I would feel super discouraged and like a piece of shit because of subpar writing, but then I'd think about all the times I'd cry over abandoned fics, and I didnt wanna do that to y'all so it helped me get off my ass and finish it! So thank you SO MUCH, I genuinely mean it. </p>
<p>Also, it's highly possible that I didn't really round out themes and motifs that i set up early, just because I wrote this ending almost a year after writing all the other stuff aha. (I'm the worst). That being said, I'm willing to write a headass epilogue-thingy that involves more of the other characters, because i feel like I didn't really include them enough but didn't wanna bog down the pacing. also, i feel like i should have more of midoriya reacting to the truth quirk lol. Idk, y'all tell me what you think! I adore constructive criticism in general.</p>
<p>That should be about it! It means so much that y'all stuck with me for nearly a year. I have a Kiribaku fic in the works that I can't wait to post, so be on the lookout if that pairing tickles your pickle.</p>

And Tony, bless him, will catch him every single time. Until the day he can't.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m falling.”<br>The words trickled out of Peter’s mouth before they’d really even formed, but Tony understood them. Peter was sure. Because the next moment those hands were pressing down a little harder, a solid weight on his shoulder and chest.<br>Grounding him.<br>“You’re not.”</p>
<p>""But you said the Captain helped you the other night?"" Ned asked as they swapped places on the mat. ""Didn't he hunt down the drug dealer or something?""<br>""I guess."" Peter grumbled, pressing his hands down on Ned's feet. ""Doesn't mean he's not a dick.""<br>Ned shrugged. Helpful.</p>
<p>Peter, who had just shot a web into the side of the facility and was riding it down, looked up to see Falcon wiz up and over him. And directly through his webbing. The web formula snapped under the pressure of Falcon’s sharp, steel wings, and then Peter was no longer gliding.<br>He was straight out falling.<br>“PETER!”</p>
<p>“They’re going to be fine – both of them.” Clint assured him, though he understood the trepidation. He’d carry the memory of Tony, well over the edge of hysteria, tearing the unresponsive boy out of a med-suit on the Compound’s front lawn for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>(Trigger Warning: attempted suicide, mentions of suicide)</p>
<p>The image of a small, frail, body being thrown from the sky flashed across his mind, replaying like a bad cassette recoding. Again. And again. And a hundred more times after that. <br>Peter. <br>Peter had fallen. <br>Peter had fallen and Tony had done nothing.</p>","<p>So I haven't written a fanfic in years - and then this popped into my head and I couldn't make it leave. These two are just so pure I had to write SOMETHING!<br>So this happened...is all un-beta'ed, so any mistakes are mine. Feel free to let me know about them in the comments.</p>
<p>Thank-you all so much for your responses! It's been fantastic! You prompted me to write this next chapter so much faster than I thought I would!</p>
<p>Here we go, another chapter! And once again it's all un-beta'd and written in a rush, so I'm sure the grammatical errors are going to be severe...</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Awww. He cares. He cares so much. </p>
<p>...and they shall return in the next chapter...</p>
<p>Sorry this chapter took a little longer...I don't know. I just wasn't happy with it. I'm still not sure about it...<br>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>I literally have no words. Everyone's support and comments on this fic have been so fantastic! I love and appreciate you all so much! Ahh. You're all so beautiful!<br>Sorry this chapter took so long! Life got in the way as per usual. Also, as per usual, this is all unbeta'd so mistakes are mine, and probably vast.<br>Hope you enjoy.</p>
<p>P.s. Also Kudos to all of you who caught the Teen Wolf reference in the last Chapter! One of my favourites!</p>

</p>
<p>I know....feelings....<br>I got quite a few mixed reviews about adding Steve into the mix, both positive and negative - and I agree with most. Steve was wrong. He made the wrong choice. He blindly put Bucky above everything. What I don't agree with is that he did it out of malice, or even because he thought it was right. He admitted that at the end of the film.<br>I like to think he genuinely regrets what he did to Tony. To all of them.<br>And in this fic, he definitely does.<br>That does not mean that he has abandoned Bucky! Not even a little. But what is he doing in this fic is trying to figure out his place, in this world, and where Bucky fits into it. That is, after all, what his arc has been through the last few films - especially Winter Soldier. He has no place anymore. But he wants one. He wants purpose again. A place again.<br>THIS DOES NOT MEAN HE IS FORGIVEN!<br>Especially not by Peter.<br>Oh, darling, grudge-holding, pouting Peter.<br>And Tony needs no comment. He is perfect. Damaged, but goddamn perfect. </p>
<p>...Also, to those wondering about Wanda...I may or may not write another fix to match this. And in that fic she would feature heavily. She is a favourite of mine, and I just feel like there is a lot about her life and choices that the films aren't touching on at the moment. If that fic does become a reality, you can expect a whole lot more Peter whump, and lots of Wanda whump to match...<br>Cause I'm cruel...and a sucker for the babies of the team...and their various, emotionally stunted parental figures...particularly Tony</p>
<p>Let me know if that would be something you're interested in?</p>
<p>Until the next chapter...which I will warn you, is going to be intense...</p>
<p>Hey all! I can't even describe what all of your support means to me. Every single comment means so much! And I'm just having such a fantastic time writing!<br>That being said...here is the next chapter!<br>Before we get into it though I would like to let everyone know about the TRIGGER WARNING for this chapter! There is a SUICIDE ATTEMPT - though the circumstances around it are a little convoluted - and quite a few REFERENCES TO SUICIDE. If this is a trigger for anyone please read with caution/don't read at all. Be safe everyone! </p>
<p>With that all out there! Please do enjoy!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>...And they will be seasoned with patriotism!</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed that piece of shameless whump.....</p>
<p>...because believe me, the next one is going to be 2731794832048% worse...</p>
<p>Poor Tony. That's the only spoiler I'm giving. Poor, poor Tony.</p>
<p>First of, oh my god, I’m so sorry! It took soooooooo long to write this. I don’t know what happened. My muse just abandoned me right at the start, and I ended up re-writing the whole thing about 3 times. <br>But here it is! At last, the final segment of this 5+1. <br>And it’s a bit of a doozy. Prepare to cry your eyes out.</p>
<p>Secondly, as with all of the other chapters, I do not have a beta and therefore all mistakes in this chapter are my own – and possibly numerous. I’m afraid my proof-reading skills really decline after about eleven (and it’s now five to one in the morning here…) So apologies – feel free to let me know of anything I may have missed in the comments.</p>
<p>Last but most certainly (by a long shot) not least, you guys are honestly more than I could ever express in words. All of your comments and kudos have mean to damn much to me – I can’t describe it. The response to this fic has been something that I only ever dreamed about. Writing, and sharing that writing, is so hard sometimes because you pour everything into it and then lay it out for the world to see – but every single one of you have made this the best writing experience of my life. <br>Thank-you all so damn much. <br>And as my gift to you for all of your amazing responses, I give you the final chapter!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And there we have it. All done and dusted. Our boys are safe – just. </p>
<p>Please let me know what you thought. This chapter was really hard for me to write, and I’d absolutely love to know what you thought. I read each and every comment (multiple times!) because they all mean so much to me. <br>Thank-you for sticking with me! <br>Until next time…<br>Eva</p>"

<p>I want to thank you all so so much. Without your support and inspiration, I'm pretty sure I would not have a chapter to post today. So really, from the bottom of my heart: Thank you guys.</p>

<p>...nah. I like the positive attention too much. :P</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the comments. They really help. :)</p>
<p>Also, for those of you sharing your own ideas about this universe, if you want to write your own fics (as inspired by ""Held Together""), go for it! I've got an open policy on that.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>We don't have NEARLY enough hurt!Thor Avengers fics. This should help fix that problem (even though it's more focused on Peter's emotional hurt than Thor's physical hurt).</p>
<p>I'm not sure how I feel about this one. It's hard to get a good read on movie-Natasha.<br>(Of course, this wouldn't be an issue if the writers had decided to explore her character like the beautiful opportunity ""Age of Ultron"" was, but instead they had to throw in a cheap romantic subplot between her and Hulk. Grrr...)</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you guys let it. Let me know what you think! The comments are extremely helpful, both for my ego and for improvement.</p>
<p>TW: mentions of animal cruelty and death.<br>(If you're a cat-lover, I'd skip this one.)</p>
<p>Shorter chapter than usual, and a lot more fluff than hurt/comfort. These guys have earned it. :)</p>
<p>TW: mentions of previous (canonical) child abuse.</p>
<p>Yeah, I made sure Tony was the last one because I knew you were all looking forward to it the most. :)</p>
<p>Much as I love reading Tony/Steve fics, I've always preferred writing them as platonic besties. For those of you with slash goggles, though...well, you don't have to take them off if you don't want to.</p>
<p>For those of you who've left comments, THANK YOU. For those of you who have left comments pertaining to Tony, you might find that some of your suggestions have snuck in here. Ask and ye shall receive. :)</p>
<p>TW for off-screen torture, and for some PTSD stuff.</p>
<p>Eventually, there may be a sequel featuring Bucky. It depends on whether or not my current workload kills me. </p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this one. I toyed with a lot of ideas and scenarios of how Steve and Peter would return the favor to their teammates in a single swoop. Not sure I chose the right one. I don't know; thoughts?</p>
<p>TW: mentions of previous neglect</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>My thoughts on Natasha is that she and the other girls in the Red Room would play a version of ""house"" to escape reality now and then. So in her dream, the Avengers were just a figment of her imagination as a child.</p>

Weirdly I have no trouble reading fics where the author as used a different actor as the template, but people think they can come on here and shame me for using Holland. Regardless of the respective ages of the actors, they are all playing the same CHARACTER, who all happen to be underage in their first films. The excuses people use about the actors being older than Tom is really grasping at straws, and I don't have time for the anti bs. In this fic, Peter is an adult. If you don't like it, don't read it.</p>
<p>Second PSA I never thought I'd have to add to a fic lmfao, but there is strong language in here, including the use of the name Jesus Christ. If that offends you, I suggest not reading any further.</p>
<p>So there was this prompt on tumblr I stumbled across that asked: For some reason, Peter thinks Deadpool knows his secret identity so he thinks its not a big deal to chat with the merc in his civilian identity whenever he bumps into him in various locations. Wade, meanwhile, is confused on why a cute but grouchy nerd keeps talking to him like they know each other but hey, its New York! Eccentrics are everywhere and this guy is really cute and doesn’t seem to mind hanging out with him! Also somehow they ended up maybe-or-maybe-not on a date???</p>

<p>Sorry for the longer wait on this one. I can't tell you how amazing all your comments have been, but it makes me want to work extra hard to give you a great chapter and not just rush it to get it out faster. Thanks so much for your support &lt;3</p>
<p>Also, my main fandom is Hannibal and I don't really have any friends/followers to talk Spideypool to. I'd love someone to look over chapters before I post, just to keep an eye on consistency and characterisation, if anyone is interested. Hit me up on tumblr: moku-youbi.tumblr.com</p>

<p>I've got a couple more chapters already finished and the rest of the story outlined, but I am really angsting over a few pacing issues, so once again I'll put a call out for someone to talk things through with me regarding that and characterisation. It would help me to post more frequently, to be sure. Hit me up on tumblr (moku-youbi) if you're interested!</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone for the offers of help. I'm contacting everyone who offered, trying to find a good fit, but I do feel a bit more confident about what I've written and where this is all going, so the next chapter shouldn't be too long of a wait!</p>
<p>Also, wow, this is such an incredible fandom--everyone here is so supportive and kind, and very generous with the feedback, which is just amazing, as an author. Thank you all so much for the kudos and the comments that keep me excited about writing &lt;3 You rock!</p>
<p>Just warning that as far as angst goes, this is probably going to be the worst chapter. This is overall, supposed to be a light-hearted fic, but with Deadpool, there's some unavoidable darkness. Still, it won't last long, but be warned that there's some bad thoughts at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p>SORRY! But it'll get better soon, I promise. However this time of year is super busy with autumn festivals and Halloween prep (we do a big party every year, so yeah, we're already getting things set up) anyway, it might be slightly longer between chapters, but I do plan on having this finished in the next few weeks!</p>

<p>Haha, hate to cut you off right there, but this chapter was getting super long, so it was time to cut it off somewhere, and this was the best place. More soon, and I think we all know what's coming now :D</p>
<p>Ahahahah, I love all of you and all your comments. I'm SO SORRY for leaving you hanging, but at least it wasn't for long, right? What can I say, your comments drove me to finish this as fast as I could so you can all enjoy it, as I've enjoyed your feedback and support. I've not really had a chance to edit it, so please forgive any errors, and I hope you have as much fun reading it as I had, writing :D</p>
<p>Safe to say, this chapter finally earns the rating of the fic, be forewarned!</p>

<p>I was super tempted to throw some Thorki in there, so just go ahead and have that confirmed as canon for this fic, if you ship it!</p>
<p>Okay, this was supposed to be a short, porny little chapter, maybe 2k...and then it turned into this monster of yes, a lot of porn, but a lot of feelings too, and just these two being adorable and hot and in love. So, sorry for the massive chapter. I considered splitting it up, but since this is already marked as complete, I want anything I *do* add to still end on a satisfying place so there are no cliff-hangers and it feels neatly tied up. </p>
<p>Also, I still plan to add a holiday themed epilogue very soon, but we'll see what time allows, this close to the holidays!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_12_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Okay, I know that's a bit of an abrupt ending, but I've been unexpectedly busy the weekend leading up to Christmas, and I really just wanted to get this up in time. Sorry if it feels rushed. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, part of the problem was that I originally started it with Wade's first meetings with Peter's friends, and got a couple thousand words of Gwen's meeting and MJ and Ned's meeting before I realised there was no way I'd get them complete in time. I'm still going to finish them up and post them, because they're fun and I'm enjoying writing them, but they'll be out of chronological order, since they come before Wade meets May.</p>
<p>So, the question is, do I just post them as additional chapters, or do I turn this into a series and post them as one-offs in the same universe? Any thoughts are appreciated!</p>
<p>And Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>ETA I've decided I'm not going to add any more chapters here. Any further content in this verse will be a separate one-off posted as part of a series with this one. So keep your eye out, because I'm working on the Wade meets Peter's friends installment, and then I will probably do a Peter meets the rest of Wade's friends installment as well.</p>"

<p>UPDATE (9/30/17): WHOO-WEEEE FINALLY UPDATED THIS 8,000 WORD MONSTROSITY YAY!! XD Let me know if you guys found any mistakes that I missed! :D</p>
<p>I don’t generally do A/Ns at the beginning of the chapter, but I felt like I needed to clarify something: Deku’s Quirk “Second Chance” sends him back to the place where he died, except now he’s alive. It’s almost like no time has passed. That’s gonna be pretty obvious with this chapter, I know, but I felt like I had to say it before we begin so you guys aren’t just like “Wait what the heck is going on.” XD Anyways, that’s all! Enjoy the chapter! :)</p>

</p>
<p>This story was originally gonna be a one-shot, but then I hit nearly 30 pages (Arial, size 12 font on Google Docs if anyone cares) and decided to make it a two-shot instead, because 10,000+ words is a lot to read (and edit, oh my gosh) in one sitting. And I edited this chapter once all the way through, but once is hardly enough, so please excuse any errors you (probably) found. XD </p>
<p>OH AND THIS IS IMPORTANT SO KEEP READING. If enough people are interested, I’m considering writing a third chapter from the POV of Class 1-A/All Might/Aizawa during the Izuku-drowns-and-is-rescued scene, but only if enough people are interested. If I write it, I can promise it will be filled with lots of angst and hurt/comfort and Dad Might and Dad/Uncle Aizawa and Class Dynamics and Class Bonding and everything in between, so if you guys are interested, I’ll write it! :) </p>
<p>Be sure to let me know either way, though, because I don’t want to waste my time writing something no one’s interested in reading. XD </p>
<p>Anyways, thank you all soooo much for reading! Like I said I’ll add a third chapter to this story if you guys are interested, but for now, this story is finished! Thank you all so much for all your support! Hopefully I’ll see y’all around! :D </p>
<p>Until next time, go beyond!! PLUS ULTRA!!</p>
<p>You asked and I delivered! XD Here's everyone else's POV!! :D</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Can I just say that I was super overwhelmed and shocked (in a good way) by all the love and support this story got in such a short amount of time??? Like, thank you all so much??? I mean seriously you guys are so sweet and amazing and it makes me so happy to know that so many of you liked my story. SO THANK YOU!!!</p>
<p>And I’m sorry if this felt choppy at all. I had a lot of POVs to cover, soooo…:/ Yeah. Oh, and you may or may not have noticed, but I didn’t write Koda’s POV, mainly because whenever I tried writing something in Koda’s POV it just felt...OOC, which is NOT good. So...I’m sorry. I love Koda, but I’d rather not write a portion than to write a portion and butcher his character. :/</p>
<p>Other than that, thank you all again!! It’s funny, this chapter is longer than either of the previous ones. Go figure! XD Thank you all so much for your support! I hope you stick around to see what other stories I’ve got under my sleeve! :) </p>
<p>Thanks again! Until next time, go beyond! PLUS ULTRA!!!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Yeah, so originally I was just gonna leave it at 3 chapters, but then I thought “Hey, how angsty would it be if I had the rest of 1-A figure out that their precious cinnamon roll classmate literally died?” and lo and behold, I’m back. </p>
<p>BUT WAIT DON’T LEAVE YET I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO ASK YOU GUYS. </p>
<p>So, like last time, I decided to ask before I wrote it, because I didn’t know if any of you would be interested, so here’s my question: </p>
<p>DO YOU WANT INKO (Izuku’s mom even though I’m sure you guys know that) TO FIND OUT ABOUT IZUKU’S “DEATH”???</p>
<p>AND I NEED TO KNOW OKAY? OR ELSE I’LL JUST STOP THE STORY AT 4 CHAPTERS (A.K.A HERE). I THINK IT COULD BE REALLY SAD AND ANGSTY WITH LOTS OF MOM AND SON BONDING BUT ONLY IF YOU GUYS WANT THAT. </p>
<p>Anyways, as usual, thanks for reading! Your support literally is what keeps me going sometimes! XD </p>
<p>Until next time, go beyond! PLUS ULTRA!!</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: So this is set in the timeline where Izuku ACTUALLY DIED. Just so everyone knows. :) </p>
<p>So do you guys want some extra tears while reading? Head on over to YouTube and listen to “Ingenium” from the newly-released Boku no Hero Season 2 OST on a loop. That was what I listened to while writing it, and let me tell you, I cried. So give it a try. You’ll regret it as soon as the tears start flowing, but hey, clicking on this story meant you wanted angst, so why not?</p>

It’s just, 8,000 words is a lot to try and edit, and I wanted to post this for you guys while I have the time, soooo, yeah. Please ignore my errors for now. I’ll fix ‘em when I got the time. XD </p>
<p>Another ridiculously long chapter I know, sorry guys. :/ But it’s not MY FAULT there are so many characters in this show to go over! And you may or may not have noticed, but I didn’t write a POV of everyone, just for my own reasons and writing troubles (with OOC-ness and whatever), but I DID have each student of 1-A write their own “Box” entry, which you probably also noticed. :)</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks soooooo much for all your amazing support! I think this story will have one more chapter (the promised chapter with Inko’s reaction to Second Chance, along with some more Dadzawa because why not?), and then we’re finished! Thank you all so much for all your continued support! It means the world to me! :D</p>
<p>Until next time, go beyond! PLUS ULTRA!!!</p>
<p>

<p>Sorry for the long wait for an update y’all! I’ve been having some heart problems lately, and my mom had to rush me down to the ER on Saturday, which is usually my big write-all-day-write-all-night day, so I’ve had to write in the evenings after school instead, but HEY I finished a chapter so cool!! </p>
<p>And, unless you guys have any other ideas on where I could take this story, I believe it’s officially...OVER. Yep, that’s right! This story’s over! (Unless, like I said, you guys have suggestions for other chapters.) </p>
<p>I just want to say, thank you all SOOO much for all your support on this story! I never expected so many people to enjoy it when I started posting, so to hear that so many people loved it just...it makes me so happy. I love you all so much. I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful week and an even more wonderful life. I love you guys sooooo much and I can’t thank you enough for all your encouragements. </p>
<p>If you guys like angst/hurt/comfort/sadness, you can check out some of my other BNHA stories! I’ve got a few I’m working on, and even more I’m planning on writing in the future, so, yeah! Hopefully you guys enjoy those! :) </p>
<p>Well, if you guys have any ideas for any other chapters for this story, leave the suggestion in the comments, okay? Otherwise, this story’s officially finished! :) </p>
<p>Anyways, thanks again for everything! Until next time, go beyond! *punches the sky* PLUS ULTRA!!!</p>
<p>Hey! So!! I never thought I would go back to this but here I am! I found an old draft for this chapter and I liked the concept so I went ahead and revised/completed it!</p>
<p>My beta hasn't had the chance to look at this yet, so I'll fix all the errors a little later on. Hope you enjoy the FINAL final installment of this fic! :) </p>
<p>*SET AFTER THE EVENTS OF the FIC</p>

<p>Gotta say, this was largely inspired from a prompt I got on tumblr where Izuku sees the other timeline sometimes even now. I'd already had that thought in part, where he revisits it in his dreams, but I dropped the idea until that prompt came in, so thank you so much for that!!</p>
<p>I know I've said it before but thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed the story! \o/</p>"

His thoughts, his possessions, and his life are all his and his alone. </p>
<p>Hannibal doesn't take from anyone. He prepares his own food, cleans his own house, and uses his own supplies. </p>
<p>So, when Hannibal starts driving Will's car everywhere, people are curious. Trust is so rare with these two, and it both makes perfect sense and is utter nonsense that it would reside between them.</p>
<p>(Basically, Hannibal borrows Will's car and everyone is super nosy about it.)</p>","<p>Prompt (and title) is from my wonderful friend/mentor/test-reader <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/users/diamerizein"" rel=""nofollow"">diamerizein</a>, who wanted a one shot in which we all learn that Will's car is a very good car, among other things. </p>
<p>To quote her rant:</p>
<p>""Will drives a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Volvo_V70_--_01-07-2012_front.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Volvo V70</a>. people of Hannibal's social class have that car (they're just not the only ones who have it like with the Bentley), and for real if Hannibal weren't expected by all of Baltimore to be his SUPER extra self it honestly wouldn't be that out of place at the opera, and the standard interior has heated and super comfy seats (like 5-day roadtrip comfy) and since it's a Swedish car it's def. built for large Scandinavian people (*cough* Mads). Also it has a manumatic transmission where like it's an automatic but you can switch into a mode where you can choose when to upshift and downshift instead of the car deciding for you, which is not a standard feature of anything but higher-end cars. And it was the safest car in the world when it was brand new (mine was a 2001).</p>
<p>I loved that car so much, I got mine as a 14-year-old hand-me-down and it was in better shape than a lot of 5-year-old cars I've seen</p>
<p>so basically: Hannibal approves but is horrified anyone would allow so much dog hair in something so nice""</p>
<p>It's not so much about the car, but here it is :)</p>

<p>Look at me, not updating my WIPs....</p>
<p>To be fair, this has been in my drafts for like two months.... </p>
<p>More updates to come soon, here's this in the meantime.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_1_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Just putting it out there, it's a really weird thought that Hannibal has to fill his own gas tank. Because, like, that's a thing that every American (sans citizens of Oregon and New Jersey) has to do. Like, Hannibal goes to grimy gas stations (because which ones aren't?) and fills his Bentley (or in this case, the Volvo) with fucking GASOLINE. </p>
<p>And because I have yet to take driver's ed courses, I did have to look up the terminology involved with gas pumping. One how-to guide called the fuel door the ""filler hole"" and suddenly gas refill took on a whole new meaning and I don't like it at all.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>and that's where i'm leaving it....</p>
<p>i'm considering writing a longer prequel to this, where will figures out hannibal's plan to frame him for the copycat murders and essentially ends up seducing him to prevent that.</p>
<p>would y'all be down for that?</p>
<p>Kudos and comments validate my existence and show me your love for this story :)</p>"

Any similarities with other stories or real names are pure coincidence. </p>

<p>At age eleven, Draco receives a letter from the future, which will make him change the path he has set out upon and lead him into a life he'd never dared to imagine.</p>","<p>Hello readers!<br>Welcome to this new (slightly major) project of mine. This idea came to me a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't been able to shake it off ever since. I hope you will have as much fun reading it as I have writing it! This is the first part of a series with seven installments, starting with The Philosopher's Stone and ending with The Deathly Hallows. Enjoy Draco's ride on the train of troublesome Gryffindors, and let me hear what you think :D</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This story will, for a large part, crawl along the original storyline by JKR, and you will come across passages that will be familiar as well as quotes from the books. Naturally, I claim no copyright for those. I am just borrowing them to twist the story into a new perspective.</p>
<p>To the readers of my other ongoing story: I promise I have not forgotten Quidditch Chronicles, and I am still working on the next chapter. Things have been going slow, but please have some more patience with me, and don't hate me for dividing my attention between those two stories ;)</p>
<p>Edit 02/05/2020: Dear readers, I want to take this moment to remind you that, in my humble opinion, the concept of 'plagiarism' isn't one that usually applies to fanfiction and should not be thrown around easily, for it is hurtful. Fanfiction is work that, in its definition and intention, borrows from source material, and I never pretended to do otherwise. These stories contain quotes of the original works from JKR, and entire paragraphs are fashioned from the source material and spiced up with Draco's POV. I did that intentionally, and I don't consider it to be plagiarism for I was upfront about what I was doing (aka, I never sold them as my words alone), I don't make money from it or get any academic recognition or anything similar with this work, it's merely fanfiction *based* on the very same work. Hundreds, if not thousands of other fanfiction writers on this platform are doing the same thing, borrowing from source material and building up their own, new story from it. I don't require you to like it, I just require you to not attack me if you don't. If you need a reminder about fanfiction protocol and what exactly constructive criticism means, please refer to the chapter endnotes I posted at the end of the sixth installment (https://archiveofourown.org/works/19998850/chapters/54599563). All hurtful comments will be deleted.</p>
<p>Edit 26/03/2023: Illustrator and graphic designer Crystal designed an amazing book cover for this story! I am so excited!! Please check it out and have a look at her instagram and website.<br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/14pQMnB_rcS1lOyvi3apCKJSRKEv1Nuug/view?usp=sharing<br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/14oQgHocB-Y_ZbuAkrkK375d9Z6Krm6iQ/view?usp=sharing<br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/14lYiOZ5dn6H2xgpyXKz_3ozaYypvSlh6/view?usp=sharing<br>Instagram: Crystall1z3d.draws<br>website: https://crystall1z3d.wixsite.com/portfolio</p>

<p>Hello, folks! Thank you for your amazing response to the prologue! I really hope this first chapter lives up to your expectations and does not disappoint! ;)</p>
<p>Please don't get used to the fast updates - I have written ahead a little, and this chapter was mostly done when I posted the prologue and just needed some adjustments. For all the following chapters, though, my beta and I might need some more time, so please be patient with us :)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy reading, and please let me know what you think :)</p>
<p>And I'm back with the second chapter :) Thanks a lot for all your encouraging comments! I realise that currently, the story still flows pretty much parallel to the original, but take my word for it when I promise it will develop a mind of its own the more Draco becomes involved with Harry. For now, I hope you don't mind the tightrope walk between canon and the Draco-inclusive plotline too much!</p>
<p>Please enjoy Draco's journey on befriending the Gryffindors, and let me know what you think :)</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your ongoing support and all your lovely comments! They cheer me up so much through the frustration that is my daily workload for university and give me the motivation I need to push on, and find some time to return to Draco &amp; Harry's adventures in my spare minutes. Love you all!</p>
<p>Now, onto the new chapter, including Hermione and a Halloween that is a couple of weeks late, but I hope you still enjoy it :) Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>Hello, my dear readers! Thank you as always for your lovely comments! I hope you will enjoy this chapter as much as the others - befitting the pre-Christmas season, it includes (not-so-festive) Christmas holidays, Lucius and Narcissa. I wish you all a fabulous December :)</p>
<p>Hello, my dearest readers! Just dropping in to throw out one more chapter before the holidays, and wishing you all a very happy Christmas in advance! Hope you have a wonderful time! Thank you for all the love I always receive from your comments - they make my world a little brighter time and time again :) Now, enough talk. Please enjoy the new chapter!</p>
<p>Happy New Year, my dear readers! We reached the second last chapter of the first instalment, and therefore, it is time for our golden quartett to make their way down the trapdoor and towards the stone. Large passages of this will be familiar, as always, but I hope Draco's presence will shake things up enough for you to enjoy reading it :)</p>
<p>We reached the last chapter of this instalment :D I hope you'll enjoy it, and that you'll stick with me for Draco's 2nd year :)</p>

Just who was Draco Malfoy?</p>
<p>Draco was used to people pitying him because they believe his soulmate is a muggle. He doesn't care what they think. He will love whoever Harry Potter is. First, he just has to find him.</p>","<p>So, if you are a reader of my other works, then you know that fluff is my thing. I write fluffy pieces and there isn't too much angst in my oneshots.

<p>Okay, so, tell me, did I do angst justice? haha I tried to end it after the letter but I just COULDN'T. I had to fix it. I just had to!<br>I may write a follow up chapter with Draco's side of it, how he felt growing up and maybe a tiny epilogue? I don't know. Is that something you guys would be interested in? If so, it will just be added to this one.<br>Soulmate stories have always been something that I am a sucker for. Hopefully you have all enjoyed this. I liked writing it. I feel like it put me out of my comfort zone though, since I don't typically do angst but that's alright.<br>See you next time!</p>

<p>At some point soon, I will get to work on the final chapter. It will be an epilogue of sorts. </p>
<p>Dobby and Draco's friendship was the only thing keeping me going during this. I felt so bad for the both of them. But I do like them being friends. </p>
<p>The events of the war didn't go into much detail and that was intentional. It wasn't the main focus of the story but more of a side note. So, if you were wanting to hear more about the war, sorry. If it helps, it was interesting in my own mind. :P</p>
<p>Well, hopefully you all enjoyed this. Until next time. </p>

<p>Hello! I am back today to finish this story off! I am soooo excited about this, you don't even know. This was a struggle the past few weeks. I had all these ideas that weren't adding up and not how I planned it. Thank you, Ren, for making my life easier. She talked me through nearly the whole fucking thing and then even looked this over for me. I adore you. You don't even know. </p>
<p>Now, I do need to explain something before you just dive right in. The back story of how Harry came to be at the Dursleys was something that a lot of you asked me to write. I wanted to do it justice and not just explain. I wanted to show you. Because of this, the first portion you will see in this final chapter is a somewhat prequel. It explains everything before I dive right back into our lovely boys. So don't treat this as you would a normal epilogue, because it's not. It's a lot more than that. </p>
<p>There is a death in this chapter, but it is a canon death and a minor character. So if that still bothers you, then I wouldn't read it.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is anything like you were expecting. There is a lot of stuff that I would like to discuss. </p>
<p>Regulus. I fell in love with this version of him and wanted to explore his decisions in this universe. To answer any questions I may receive, no one besides Severus, Draco and Harry will know what Regulus did. I find a certain painstaking grief that someone who went through so much trouble for the light was unrecognized. Idk why, but this was something I wanted to explore. </p>
<p>Also, the reason I had Kreacher living after drinking the poison was a difference in species. His body would be different than that of a wizard and could be resilient to all kinds of things that would harm a wizard. </p>
<p>If you are wondering why Dumbledore was so keen to believe that Severus was doing it all for Lily, is that I believe he either wasn't aware of Regulus at all outside of the man being Sirius' brother, or he just assumed incorrectly about where Severus' heart was. </p>
<p>I debated a long time about whether I would show Draco getting out of St. Mungos or not. I decided to leave it this way because it felt more real. It felt more believable than having him have a happy ending that solved everything. He can have a happy ending and still go through what he did. He can still have a happy ending and be inside St. Mungos. I will leave it up to you to see what you will. If you see Draco getting out, then by all means, believe in that. If not, then that is fine too. </p>
<p>Some of you may wonder why I didn't go into depth about Ron and Hermione, but that was already explained in the first chapter. They lied to Harry because they assumed he was a muggle and didn't think it would be fair to him that he might not ever get to see Draco due to the spells keeping muggles out. They have apologized for this and he will become friends with them. Tentative ones. But it's a start.</p>
<p>The bonus scenes were something that I had wanted to include but didn't have a proper place for them. So, I still hope you liked them!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this!</p>

<p>This fic was inspired by the comments section in Chapter 4 of Siberian Variations by AnonHouse.</p>
<p>It's divided into two halves so we'll have to wait a bit before we get to Cap.</p>
<p>Okay, in this chapter there are a couple of real life TV personalities. I am sorry if I butchered them but I haven't seen them since at least early high school and I was never a big talk show watcher.</p>
<p>That said, enjoy. :)</p>
<p>Also since so many people have asked, this part of the story is set in 2005.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>In a previous comment, I pointed out that Afghanistan could have just been a business trip that Obadiah took advantage of. That's the idea I'm going for here.</p>
<p>And, yes, Iron Man is coming.</p>
<p>I apologise in advance is my Hungarian is bad. I don't speak the language and I don't know any Hungarian people so I had to use the horror that is Google Translate.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Yup, it's Carol.</p>
<p>Since her movie is supposed to take place in the 90s, there's no way she wouldn't have her powers when Afghanistan happened. So why can't we involve her here? ;)</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_8_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I can't quite remember, but I think Tony had to build a Hadron Collider in IM2. Correct me if I'm wrong. :)</p>

</p>
<p>The Sharon Carter issue was inspired by a comment by Hawkwind1980.</p>
<p>It also made me think: why is Sharon Agent <em>13</em>? Why 13 specifically? What's the numbering system?</p>
<p>I skip over quite a bit here, but it's been a while since I've seen Avengers and (out of sheer laziness) I got a lot of it from YouTube clips. X)</p>
<p>And, yes, Tony and Pepper are together in this. They got together in the timeskip.</p>

<p>S.H.I.E.L.D.'s power is severely depleted, but it's not completely gone. It is still useful to HYDRA, which is how they got their hands on Rogers first.</p>
<p>Like I said, last chapter, there's a bit of skipping over here and I dead cheat a bit by using YouTube clips. X)</p>

<p>Thor thinks ""that few"" due to something I saw on Tumblr once. Someone (can't remember who) made the suggestion that Thor, coming from a warrior culture such as the Asgardians, said ""he's adopted"" because he was embarrassed not by Loki killing people but because 80 was a small number of people to have killed for them.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_15_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>The idea for S.H.I.E.L.D. to tell Steve Tony ""abandoned"" Peg was suggested in an earlier comment. I can't find it right now but I'll credit it to the person who made the suggestion.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_16_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Yeah, Fury wanted those three (Tony, Bruce, and Thor), but he had to make do when he couldn't get them. I'm thinking he just grabbed some loyal S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives to throw on the team.</p>
<p>The reason I had Steve call Tony to complain is both because I think he would and I wanted to establish that he did actually have Tony's number. ;)</p>
<p>I said in earlier comments I needed S.H.I.E.L.D. around for the info-dump. This is why. ;)</p>

<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I think Kouda's chapter may have been one of my favourite to write but yay, EraserMic is now Confirmed. XD Let me know what you thought and if you have any ideas for future chapters - please and thank! .xx Dan</p>
<p>so...I hoped to have this fic finished by winter and.....well, let's just say I'll be lucky to get it done by spring. #oops! We're getting there, slowly, slowly. XD</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you liked how this one played out! Also, feel free to check out the rest of this series as, yeah, it's a series now! .xx Dan</p>
<p>ayy yo, at it again! We're over halfway now and I'm so excited!! Thank you everyone who's been reading this :))</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And there we have it :))) Hope you enjoyed and would love to know what you thought! .xx Dan</p>
<p>I'm finally back!! Sorry about the wait, I've kinda been caught up in a new fic, ha ha. But anyway, that being said, if you haven't read the rest of the series, I'd probably go and do that because this fic and the rest of the stories are starting to have a lot of crossovers and you might be confused about bits if you don't read up :)))</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>we've only got six students left and I'm starting to get excited!! That means we're nearly at the end - yay!!! .xx Dan</p>
<p>sorry for the delay in getting this chapter out; if you follow me, you know I've been overseas and have a few other fics I'm working on. #oops</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_8_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)

<p>thanks for reading; it's the downhill run from here! .xx Dan</p>
<p>Welcome to the penultimate chapter~! Enjoy &lt;333</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_9_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)

<p>Eep thank you for waiting for this sequel. I think it may not have been what you expected but nonetheless I hope you enjoyed it! Basically what I wanted to say with this chapter is that there's strength in fighting for yourself, but there's also strength in knowing when it's time to let go and move on - it's not giving up, it's realising what's best for yourself, your life, your happiness --- so never think it's cowardly to decide to walk away from something that doesn't make you happy. There's strength in removing yourself from a toxic environment!</p>
<p>A lot requested historical au so I will think about a fic for this, and also may try some vampire au - we'll see hehehe</p>
<p>Also, after much request, my twitter account is @R_g715 xxx I'm still figuring twitter out though hahaha. I probably won't be extremely active on the account all the time but I'm looking forward to interacting with you all more.</p>

<p>I haven't had a chance to reply to everyone (I always feel like yall would rather have me work on more fic than replies...) but I want to say how happy the comments I received on the first chapter made me feel. You guys are all wonderful. &lt;333</p>
<p>So this story is probably going to be bigger than expected... I've set it for six chapters but I suspect there's considerably more to it than that.</p>

(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_12_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Probably only one more chapter to this story, unless the remaining scenes become larger than expected, but good news - </p>
<p>I'm fairly confident that this is going to be a series. The next story is still foggy, but I think the main plot line will revolve around Champ starting kindergarten and Will and Hannibal butting heads with the school psychologist. Meanwhile, Will and Champ spend more time at Hannibal's home, and perhaps meet one of Hannibal's patients who also has a young son... </p>
<p>Yall interested in a continuation?</p>

<p>A quick note: originally, I wrote that Peter said that the US bombed Japan until they surrendered. However, one reader informed me that Japan actually made moves to surrender before the US bombed them, but that the US bombed them anyway, potentially just to test out their bombs and show their power. That being said, another reader informed me that unconditional surrender seemed unlikely on Japan's part, especially since Japan didn't make an offer to surrender after the first bomb. The various sources I've looked at tend to contradict each other, but just keep in mind that history is far more complicated than it's portrayed in the history books—the bombing of Japan is clearly far less black and white than we think it is. It's realistic for Peter not to know any of this, given what we get in history classes here in the US, but I reworded that line so as not to spread misinformation either way.</p>
<p>Bucky's character is heavily influenced by that in Owlet's series Infinite Coffee and Protection Detail. You don't have to read it to understand this, but it helps!</p>

<p>I'm sorry this took so long. I ran into that weird form of writer's block where you know EXACTLY what happens . . . and because of that, you have no motivation to write.</p>
<p>But it's done now!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And thus ends the dragon AU, at least for now.</p>
<p>I'm going to be taking a semi-break from fan fiction. I've been neglecting my original work for about . . . six months now . . . which is obviously a bit Not Good. That's going to be my next writing priority, but that's not to say I'm going to drop away from fan fiction entirely! I've got a prompt for another Merlin fic, my Not All Stories AU needs a conclusion, and my Untainted AU has at least one more potential installment waiting for it. </p>
<p>Those could come at any time, although that least won't be at least until February. Other stories could well pop up in the meantime - if one starts hopping up and down and begging for attention I'm certainly not going to ignore it - but I'm not going to be chasing down ideas and pinning them down for my beta to help me chew up either.</p>
<p>Untainted AU aside, I'm particularly unsure when I'll be returning from the batman fandom. I've loved writing for it, and the response has been amazing, but it's difficult to write for a fandom when your beta/brainstorm buddy has no experience with it. She has been amazingly supportive despite this, but the difficulty remains.</p>
<p>That said, I DO have more ideas, and I do WANT to return to it, so I'll try to make that happen. Until then, happy reading!</p>
<p>Damian's name's meaning comes from the meaning-of-names website. His name can actually mean a number of things. I went with the Indian meaning in MHR and mentioned the Greek because it fit there; here I chose the Spanish meaning because it was funnier.</p>
<p>The idea for this can probably be traced back at least partially to Jessica Day George's Dragon Slippers. In it, dragons all want hoards but WHAT they hoard is widely individual. It might be shoes, or stained glass, or, if you're rather eccentric, dogs. But there's a moment when one dragon sees that another has a human in his cave and is horrified to think that the other dragon might have started to hoard humans.</p>
<p>Then, years after I read the books, I'm writing MHR, and Bruce gets a bit possessive just as Tim is suggesting picking a draconic hero name based on his last name . . . And, well, this resulted.</p>
<p>I'm marking this as two chapters because haven written this, there are a couple of missing scenes (mainly, exactly what went down when Bruce met his first three boys and possibly Stephanie) that I want to write.</p>
<p>One last thing: I literally wrote just yesterday that I would probably never write Terry McGinnis because I am not qualified to do so and have no interest in becoming so. Then, today, I got the idea for his section, which goes to show that I should never say that I will never write something. I did my best to do some research to make this as in character as possible. If I failed horribly, just assume that living in a world with dragons profoundly affected him. Or pretend that he's a totally different character who just happens to share the name.</p>

Ooops...<br>Anyway, lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Mod des ;)</p>","<p>Okay, so this is obviously gonna be way different from canon (the slytherins aren't mindless evil-doers, somebody does something about the Dursley's... etc) and some of the ideas for this fic (like Harry's extra-sensory perception of magic) are my own details. I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this but I honestly cannot wait to get there. Me and my fickle muse (Bassy the Basilisk) hope you enjoy it. Well, I hope you enjoy it; Bassy's still mad that I won't let her slither out and eat any of you. Love forever (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>

<p>TW: A lot of child abuse referenced in this chapter.</p>
<p>Another chapter- the longest so far, and the last for the night, unfortunately. But I'm quite proud of this one. They go back to Hogwarts, I've changed a lot from canon, and I happen to think it's quite humourous. Although... I've been told I'm only funny to myself, so who knows? Anyway, enjoy! <br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>
<p>Well, this chapter's a lot less humourous than the last one, but I happen to think it's very good and shocking (and uniquely my own) although you're free to disagree. I hope you enjoy, though.<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>
<p>This chapter is a bit shorter (only about 800 words) and more of a filler than anything, but I was still angry with Dumblefore and wanted an excuse to yell at him some more, so here you go.</p>
<p>So, next chapter! Quick note, in this version, Harry is not a horcrux (there still are Horcruxes, but Harry isn't one. It just doesn't work with what I have planned). This is also where the plot really gets going. Anyway, enjoy.</p>
<p>So, this chapter is pretty long... one of the longest I've written, which I hope will satisfy as it's all I've got for the night. Anyway, we getting into the thick of things! Yay!</p>
<p>Hey guys! So, here's another chapter. I realized today that this document for the fic is 76 pages, double-spaced, as of this chapter! That's an insane amount of writing for me to get done in the space of the week. Maybe Bassy just likes that she's working on a fic featuring her kin, lol.</p>
<p>So this chapter is mostly just a bit of mindless h/c fluff because, heck, it's Monday, but it does have a purpose in the plot as well, as you'll see at the end. Shorter than usual, but it's one am and I'm ready to see the Sandman.</p>
<p>New chapter; love y'all.</p>
<p>Hey guys, last chapter for the night :/. Quick note- I've changed the timing of the quidditch game a bit to fit my plotline. And don't worry, Draco will still be on the quidditch team for slytherin, just not his second year. With everything going on and without his father to pressure him into trying out the minute he was eligible, he just didn't quite get to it this year. He will still be the seeker his third year, though, and I do plan on taking the story that far, and farther, I hope.</p>
<p>HI! More stuffs for my pals.</p>
<p>This chapter is a VIPP- Very Important Plot Point. Dun Dun Dun.</p>
<p>Now we're getting somewhere! And yes, the gang is now very into muggle entertainment. And thank @Bairnsidhe for the idea for the final line of this chapter. And yes, I know snakes on a plane didn't come out until 2007. Just go with it- they still had snakes and planes in 1992.<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole)<br>Des ;)</p>
<p>For what was, in the original book, a pivotal chapter, this part's rather shorter than you'd think it would be. But well, it's Minerva McGonagall, and she goes BAMF! Hope you enjoy, and that it's not too anticlimatic.</p>
<p>Yay, another chapter! Not too much integral happening here, but it's almost 2000 words. Somehow my fluff chapters seem to always be longer than my crucial, integral plot-point chapters.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_28_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed. And for anyone who follows the baker street boys, yes, that was a johnlock reference at the end. ;)</p>
<p>Not too much going on here; just a fun little chapter. Forgive me if there are more grammar errors than usual; I'm exhausted.<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Mod des ;)</p>
<p>So this is a pretty short chapter today, mainly just some filler. I'm gonna do a chapter about Christmas then another chapter or two just wrapping up second year, although there won't be too much action happening, which is also why I've been a little slow updating the past couple chapters (that and I had the flu). Then this work will be finished, but I've decided to make this a series of works. I've got ideas for the next one- It's gonna be called The Prisoner of Azkaban and the Incompetence of the Wizarding Judicial System. Then I hope to do fourth year, which I will call The Goblet of Fire and Juesus Fucking Christ what the fuck is wrong with you people?! After that, well, who knows?<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>
<p>Hey, so another of my heacanon-y AU's towards the end of this chapter. Don't worry; all shall be explained eventually....</p>
<p>Also, I don’t speak Latin, but as a Spanish major I realise that the fact that I used google translate means that the translation is most likely fucked. I apologise to anyone who speaks Latin and is offended by this.</p>
<p>Gods, this fluffy little bit was so much fun to write. We are winding towards the end of the chamber, and then it's time for the next work...</p>
<p>LAST CHAPTER OF MY FIRST COMPLETE FIC IN THIS SERIES! YAY! I AM CRAZY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR MANAGING TO FINISH THIS. Okay, small letters now. I am so excited to start the next work in the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban and the Incompetence of the Wizarding Judicial System, and I hope to have the first chapter or two up in the next few days.</p>
<p>Next chapter will hopefully be up soon-ish, but I've got a service project early tomorrow (don't worry, I usually have Saturday's free, it's just this one day for this one class, so weekends will probably be my most usual time to update. Well, maybe not every weekend, and maybe it will be randomly in the middle of the week. I try to make plans and life laughs at them, so, eh).</p>"

<p>Then I read a fic that had Sakura as a Senju descendant. Somewhere in my mind the ideas got crossed, then escalated because Sakura should have been treated better in the series. Heck. All the female characters should have been treated better. Honestly, if Naruto and Sasuke were going to be God-moded, then gosh darnit, Sakura should have been too! </p>

<p>So, I'm a recovering alcoholic. The first chapter of this was written while I was still drinking, the second while I was a couple weeks sober, and the third after I had a few months of sobriety under my belt. I think each chapter maybe kinda reflects the mood and state of mind I was in when I wrote it, but anywho.</p>
<p>I've really relied on this story for the last few months - for the cathartic outlet it gave me, and for the comments and kudos from all of you. On some days, the support and encouragement people gave me while I writing this seemed like the only good thing happening in my life. I wanted to say thank you for reading, and for making my life just a little bit brighter when things were looking grim. Things are far better now, but I don't think ""better"" would have happened as quickly as it did without the positive encouragement I received for this story.</p>
<p>Again, thank you, and I hope you enjoyed the story.</p>"

Make teachers look out for their kids. Don’t put up with any kind of violence—this should be a fucking safe space for kids. And the little shit-stains who think they’re above the rules because they’ve got a fancy quirk? You deal with them, too. Quirk usage is illegal. Physical assault is illegal. And yet I saw all that and more when I was here—I <em>did</em> all of that and more when I was here.”</p>
<p>The principal stares at him. “You’re saying you wanted us to give you detention?”</p>
<p>Detention. Like that would have done anything.</p>
<p>“I’m saying,” Bakugou says through gritted teeth, “that you should’ve expelled me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or: how Bakugou became an anti-bullying advocate.</p>","<p>Partially inspired by anon, who asked, <em>How did Bakugou and Izuku reconcile properly?</em></p>
<p>This takes place before all other fics in this universe. Part of this fic takes place during the July Attacks—the final attack launched around Musutafu when Class 1-A were third years, mentioned in a few other fics. The rest of the story takes place three years later when they’re pro heroes still working to climb the hero ranks. You probably don’t have to read the rest of the series for this to make sense, but I would recommend it (or at least “history has its eyes on you”).</p>
<p>There’s no social media snippets in this fic, unfortunately. Because I’m jumping around the timeline, it would have been way too confusing to include them. </p>
<p>The majority of Class 1-A would participate in some kind of advocacy (Momo especially is a famous feminist!), but I wanted to focus on Bakugou for this. Also, there’s a LOT of work that we don’t see, because if I were to sit down and write out the entirety of Bakugou’s and Midoriya’s slowly developing friendship, I would up with, like, 100k, and I’m a very tired uni student who doesn’t have the time or energy for that. Right now I’m typing this up at 7pm at a local library instead of studying.</p>
<p>Because this is a future fic, Bakugou’s characterisation is a little different than usual. He’s growing, and he’s going to continue to grow. </p>
<p>Warnings for brief mentions of blood and continuous references to bullying, both past and present.</p>

<p>This chapter is super short and I'm super sorry; it's been that kind of week ...</p>
<p>By the by, for the many people wondering where I came up with the idea for evil!Laura, it wasn't my idea. ^_^ It was a prompt someone sent in that I ran with. The idea of Laura having worked with Kate to set the fire was something that had never occurred to me before the amazing prompt that inspired this story.</p>
<p>I did mention that I had basically taken the canon out back and shot it, right? *checks tags* Ah, yes, I did. Excellent. =D</p>
<p>Happy weekend, everybody ^_^</p>
<p>Haha, it got schmoopy. #noregrets</p>

<p>-bursts into the fandom with a moldy slice of pizza and a computer key stuck to my finger- WHAT YEAR IS IT</p>
<p>i'm gonna be honest i haven't actually read bnha beyond the hero killer part so i'm REALLY behind and don't know who any of the new characters are so if you say something and i don't know what you're talking about then i'm sorry in advance </p>
<p>i wrote this a while ago and never posted it! but, let's be honest, dekubowl is the only true ship and i may not be properly in this fandom but i will not die without making sure there is at least SOME dekubowl content on this hellsite</p>
<p>also want everyone to know i have a dog now. she's brown and her name is mocha and she's ruined my cactuses and several slippers and also tried to take a burger out of my hand and she gets so excited to go on walks that she won't let me put my shoes on. i love her to pieces, she's the worst.</p>
<p>anyway thanks aly for being overall great and supportive, i dedicate iida in this fic to you. i hope he's worthy.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>if you were expecting actual plot then i dunno what to tell you except that im very sorry </p>
<p>listen guys there's this REALLY FAT elderly dog in my neighbourhood and he has no teeth but if you go to the fence he'll waddle over to say hello. you'll have to wait for a while though because he's really,,,,,,,really fat and walking anywhere takes a while</p>
<p>originally i had aizawa being like 'sorry i'm late i didn't want to come' but that's probably OOC? i think? i dunno man i'm not up to date and at this point i'm sort of just winging it so if you see something i wrote and it looks iffy then just know that i know, man. i know. </p>
<p>anyway leave a comment or something and i'll get back to you soon, have a good weekend y'all</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>do i update on time? no. but is it worth the wait? also no. </p>
<p>i'm actually genuinely busier than i want to be right now though so i'm gomen</p>
<p>anyway i was in morocco a while ago and i was standing around on a mountain when i was approached by a man holding a very small goat. he put it in my arms and told me its name was jimi hendrix. it was really soft. noisy, though. </p>
<p>also the other day there was a sale and i bought three pairs of heels. did i need them? no. but when you see a shoe sale you have to honour izuku's spirit somehow. the jordans were watching over me. you know i had to do it. </p>
<p>here is a poll for you: does iida wear boxers or briefs?</p>
<p>i should have called this fic 'all hands on deku' lol</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>AU in which everything is the same except midoriya and bakugou switch characters:</p>
<p>bakugou: i know you want to go to UA but you're vulnerable without a quirk. i'm going to become a hero and protect you because that's what friends do!<br>midoriya, loading a glock: shut the fuck up baka-gou i dont need a quirk to kick your ass</p>
<p>i'd pay to see that kind of hero, though. he just happens to have a gun. no quirk needed, just a bullet between the eyes of the villain of the week. they call him Gun Guy. he's not very popular.</p>
<p>speaking of popularity, i believe with all my heart that there's a legion of brand name sports wear waiting for iida to graduate high school so he can be the face of their next campaigns. you best believe adidas is ready to slap some stripes on our boy ingenium. nike has a line of running shoes they want him to approve, and puma wants a collab with uraraka for their anti-gravity lightweight sneakers. </p>
<p>reebok's gunning for todoroki but for some reason the only ads he does are for thermoses because he feels a kinship with them idk</p>
<p>thanks everyone for your input, the majority of people believe that iida wears mainly briefs. </p>
<p>this week's poll: does todoroki have one cold nipple and one warm one. Is one nipple always perky from the cold and the other one is normal. Is that the real reason he froze himself. So his nipples would match. Dial 1800 to place your vote. </p>
<p>i should really go to bed</p>

<p>hi i'm on some really gnarly meds that wont let me sleep and it's been three days so I think my sense of humour’s abandoned all logic so if this is bad then i'm sorry??? I really am but my grip on the waking world was tenuous at best and now i genuinely feel like a balloon only barely attached to my head so please forgive me just this once</p>
<p>due to last chapter's poll my eyes have been opened not only to the details of icyhot's icyhot nipnops, but to the idea that the carpet matches the drapes, which i will go so far as to extend to the rest of his body. leg hair, arm hair, underarm hair....half and half, baby.</p>
<p>this week i ask: of the 1A boys, who's gonna be the first to lose their v-card? </p>
<p>AU in which someone (probably kirishima) figures out that Bakugou's a lot less cranky after getting dicked down, so whenever he starts acting up somebody hauls him off to fuck him quiet</p>
<p>todoroki keeps accusing him of being pissy just because he wont admit he wants to fuck<br>bakudeku hate sex<br>bakugou enjoying himself immensely until he figures out that a) pretending to be cranky doesnt work with iida because iida just gives him a stress ball, which is a problem because b) iida has a size 12 shoe</p>

</p>
<p>JustAPassingStranger: Can you imagine lida trying to stop midoriya by standing in front of him so he cant go past.. and midoriya... just?? Picks him up??? Like nbd??? Because i can and the image has cleaned my soul and mowed the lawn</p>
<p>a little wholesome content this time.</p>
<p>mcdonalds features a lot in this fic. partly that's because i find the image of deku with happy meals hilarious, but also because there's a mcdonalds near my old high school and we used to go there to hang out when we saved up enough money. it was also the only place that would deliver to us after class lol. i passed a lot of my high school life with shitty burgers and not-shitty friends. mcdonalds is nostalgic for me, so i write about it here too.</p>
<p>a dear friend of mine told me she made friends with a boy in college who spent a lot of time with her and frequently complained that the girl he liked only thought of him as a friend:</p>
<p>her: you should tell her how you feel! be honest so she can give you a proper answer<br>him: how?<br>her: well i think you should just come out and say it. tell her 'i like you'.<br>him: okay. i like you.<br>her: yeah! just like that!</p>
<p>so if you're judging deku for being the way he is, just know there are people like this who exist.</p>
<p>i just love to imagine todoroki being a Rich Bitch when it comes to bakugou.....oh you have new nikes? yeah i didn't like the feel of the new jordans so i bought 50% of the company and asked them to change the design,,,,,, but let's be real i'm sure todoroki probably owns and lives in at least 3 pairs of crocs</p>
<p>anyway i think there's one chapter left! maybe two if i think of something else to write. see y'all next time!</p>

<p>things that make my dog happy:</p>
<p>- human friends<br>- chicken<br>- car rides<br>- when you refill her water bowl just when she was getting thirsty<br>- walks<br>- my blanket<br>- digging up the plants and then acting sad when you call her a bad dog but then doing it again the next day<br>- butt scratches<br>- that fat old dog down the street<br>- when you shake the broom at her and say 'rrrrr'</p>
<p>ambition pushes you to do great things, but recently i've been learning that it's nice to love little things too.</p>
<p>anyway, here's the end to a slightly crazy fic. i don't really have any favoured pairings in bnha, so the conclusion was kind of decided on a whim haha. thank you so much for reading this far (some even from the very beginning!) and especially thank you to the people who took time out of their day to leave a comment. seeing a familiar username makes me feel like i'm getting to know you a little bit, even though i don't know what you look like. writing this has been a blast so thanks for letting me talk nonsense and bully iida.</p>

<p>you might see me around sometime, i don't know. maybe the adventures of Bakuhoe will speak to me.</p>

</p>
<p>surprise! bet you thought you'd seen the last of me lol</p>
<p>uhm, sorry for the sudden addition. a lot of people mentioned that they expected this to go down the todobakudeku route. most people were really nice about it, and i thought it was an interesting idea so i decided to try writing that version to see how it would go. i know this addition is kind of pointless, but i'm amused that it's kind of like a visual novel. ch7 is how i originally planned it to go but i guess you can choose whichever one you like better. </p>
<p>please don't take this as serious shipping fic, though. first and foremost this was a silly story i made up to make some people laugh. the pairings are just for fun. i dont actually have any ships (in bnha or in general) so don't think too hard about it! i was just hoping this update would be an interesting take on how the fic could have gone. i hope you don't mind the lack of definitive ending. </p>
<p>leave a comment if you like! at the time of writing i haven't actually replied to last chapter's comments but i'll get to that soon. </p>
<p>ok see you guys i should probably go to bed lol have a good week!</p>

<p>three years. three years this has been bothering me. over time it faded to the back of my mind but some nights i snap awake and wonder 'what if'. what if i'd properly leaned into the visual novel element. what if i'd done better foreshadowing so i could explore all the pairing options i wanted. what if we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars. my questions have mostly been answered. i've finished the wretched work i set myself all that time ago. </p>
<p>i can finally rest in peace.</p>"

<p>the timeline looks like this: </p>
<p>Peter is 25; he did 4 years of undergrad at CUNY, took a year off to work, then went back for his Master's at 23. He's just finishing up at Cornell, with one more semester left. He was Spiderman every break until the last winter break, then stopped because he knew the pressure was on to complete his final project (I'm calling this a thesis but many M.S. programs have their students do projects instead.)</p>"

<p>This fic is also full gen. All relationships are platonic, aside from brief mentions of Sokka/Suki.</p>
<p>I’ve included a lot of personal headcanons and taken liberties with canon (including comic canon, which I pretty much disregard entirely), especially in terms of worldbuilding at the beginning of the fic. I’ve adjusted some minor things in episode 21 for the sake of logic. Plus, I really like the idea that Agni Kai’s are nuanced and have a bunch of rules. I also like the idea that the Avatar can defeat and then dismiss people in power if they absolutely have to. I mean, I figured that was kind of what was going on in canon, but still.</p>
<p>Also, Zuko’s characterisation may seem a little different, too, now that the stress of the war is over and he’s actively working to be a better person.</p>

<p>Bunny. The nickname that baby Bakugou first gave Deku was <em>Bunny</em>. Of course, Bakugou would rather die than let Deku know that.</p>
<p>I’ve written a redemption arc for Bakugou in my future verse, but when writing him as a teenager, I usually stick fairly close to canon in terms of how much of a bully he is. That doesn’t make it right. He has a long way to go in terms of apologising to Izuku and growing as a person, and this fic is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Also, deleted scene:</p>
<p>Aoyama: “I’m grateful that you invited me to sit with your group, Midoriya. I’ve been wondering how to befriend you for some time now—your idea was much better than mine.”</p>
<p>Midoriya: “What was your idea?”</p>

<p>Thank you to all of my readers. The love I’ve received for this fic has been so humbling. I ended up re-writing this chapter half a dozen times before I was happy with the way it unfolded, but I never fully abandoned it because of all of your lovely comments. </p>

<p>Readers of the ‘see it all in bloom’ series will recognise Bubblegum Blitz from ‘who lives, who dies, who tells your story.’ To everyone else: they are Izuku’s sidekick and goes by they/them pronouns. </p>
<p>And to anime-only fans who were extremely confused last chapter about what exactly I meant by ‘cheese message’ in end notes: it’s a reference to Aoyama’s antics in Chapter 168 of the manga.</p>

<p>I have this fic mostly written out already, but I'm still ironing out some of the major plot points. Any feedback you have is wildly appreciated, you have no idea.</p>
<p>Just to give you guys an idea of what I'm doing: there will probably be anywhere from one to four more chapters in this fic. I'm not sure how much of what I've written will make the final cut.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your feedback, it means the world.</p>

(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)

<p>The comments being left on this fic legitimately make me glow. Every five minutes when I check my email, new ones show up and they just make me so happy, you know? I read and reread them over and over again, you guys have no idea. The amount of warm fuzzies I've gotten is mind boggling.</p>
<p>Also: for those of you asking about my update schedule, I do everything I can to update daily.</p>

</p>
<p>Just to let you guys know what I'm planning on doing: there will be one more chapter in this fic (two, if it gets too long) and one more fic in this series. It will probably be a one shot covering the evolution of Peter and Tony's relationship from the beginning, and it will be significantly longer than any of the chapters I've posted. Because of this, it might take me one or two days to get it up after I finish this fic.</p>
<p>I'll also be posting a few one shots over the next few days; I posted the first one last night.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you so much for your comments, you have no idea how much they mean to me.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the last chapter in this fic. But stay tuned! There will be a third fic in this series - a one shot - capturing the evolution of Peter's relationships with everyone, but mainly Tony Stark.</p>
<p>I hope you guys enjoy.</p>

<p>There were a number of ways Connor could tackle the predicament he was in. Many of them ranged in success rates with varying results but, while taking into account his uncertainly on Hank’s part, Connor ultimately chose to be indirect. He wanted to subtly hint to Hank that he wanted them to have sex. Though, he didn’t know whether it would work or not. Hank was incredibly unpredictable sometimes. </p>
<p>So, one evening while Hank was on his way back from the precinct, Connor stood in front of his dresser. He chose to wear a large, white long-sleeve shirt with a wide collar that he had to roll up to his elbows. It ended just below his underwear, settling just beneath the curve of his ass. He opted out of wearing pants and dug into the back of Hank’s sock drawer for a pair of grey wool socks that bunched up around his ankles.</p>","<p>

This chapter was later than I wanted it to be, but I won’t be as busy for the rest of the time this story is being written. I plan on posting every two or three days. Let me know what you guys want to see as this fic nears the end!!</p>

<p>I had a blast writing the scene with Sam and Clint! I’ve had the boomerang arrows and stolen sandwich idea for a while now, so I was really excited to finally write it! We’re nearing the end of this fic, so tell me what you guys want to see before it ends!</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, it’s been so long since I last updated. I am so sorry guys. I’ve been very busy the last few days, and I just recently found time to write, so that’s why the chapter came so late. My apologies!</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Only one chapter left! I hope this went how you guys hoped it would!</p>
<p>Hello everyone!! So sorry for the late update, I was totally not prepared for classes to start again. Due to my lateness, I decided to make this chapter extra long for you guys, it’s over 5,500 words! Also, I wanted to thank everybody who read this story, and left kudos and comments!! You guys helped me finish this fic! Enjoy the last chapter!!</p>

<p>That’s a wrap! I hope this turned out the way you guys wanted it to. I now have a wattpad account for those of you who are on that website. My username is crime_spiderling. Also, I thought I’d let you guys know that I’ll be writing a series of one shots and short stories based around Peter, for any of you that are interested in reading it. I’m not sure when I’ll put it up, but be on the lookout!! I’ll hopefully be updating it weekly. Thank you everybody for reading!!</p>
<p>Hello all! This is my first fanfic so I’d really appreciate any comments!</p>"

<p>Why not the Weasleys, you may ask. Well, Severus has fairly strong opinions about children paying their way; he is not happy for the cost of Harry's care to come out of his own trust vaults. Whether or not he's right in that opinion is its own question.</p>

<p>So...I spent about five hours today making a feasible timetable for all seven core subjects at Hogwarts. (It's harder than it looks, once you take into account the fact that each teacher has to deliver ALL the contact hours for TWELVE class groups.) Since it took me so long, I couldn't possibly let it disappear into the ether, so you're all very welcome to check it out at https://goo.gl/qaB5vD and boggle at how ridiculously hard most of the teachers are working.</p>
<p>(Also - I've edited the 'previous' chapter so that it comes after this one, because I've realised I messed up the timing. It should have been set just after the Easter holidays, which would have been mid-April in 1992.)</p>

<p>And so we reach the end of Book One!</p>
<p>I have more ideas in mind for this universe, but they get substantially more canon divergent and it's going to take we a while to figure out how it's all going to work. But, hopefully, I will start posting Book Two at some point in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'd love to hear what about this fic you liked best, if you've got a minute to tell me about it - I tried a lot of new things with this one, and I'd love to know what worked!</p>"

<p>Thanks so much for all the kudos and comments :) this story is getting much more popularity than I expected so here's another chapter:))))))</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>What did you think of how I wrote for Carol so far? I haven't really read many comics with her in them so I was mostly going off the internet... :) and don't worry Peter will get more protective of Tony soon he was just a bit surprised poor spidey :/</p>
<p>Comment what you thought :D</p>
<p>I decided to release this now even though its a bit shorter than the other chapters. Mostly since I wanted to give you guys some more before going to bed. The joys of waking up to your awesome comments in the morning. :)</p>
<p>A couple of things that I'm not sure I made clear:<br>-Hope and Tony were childhood friends before their dads fell out and then they still were after but didn't see one another as often.<br>-Ragnarok happened completely the same as the movie but Thanos wasn't there at the end instead he was attacking Xandar.<br>-All of the New Avengers know about Siberia and Tony's Panic attack's/anxiety/PTSD/medication<br>-Tony was way more injured than he was in the MCU and actually in a coma for a couple of weeks which is part of the reason the New Avengers aren't that welcoming to the Rogues.<br>-The other reason is just that they don't really like them because of the Civil War fiasco</p>
<p>Alright, enjoy the chapter!</p>

<p>ARGH the IRONSTRANGE is too ADORABLE!<br>I love them so much *wipes away tear*</p>
<p>That joke Harley made is their new 'connected' joke so expect it to crop up more often :)))<br>Don't worry fellow IronStrange shippers, there will be some fluff soon</p>
<p>Please comment what you thought or if you have any questions/suggestions/general ideas and expect a new chapter most likely tomorrow! <br>:D</p>
<p>You guys are the BEST! Your comments are all so kind and funny and just <br>A M A Z I N G!!! I literally had a fangirl heart attack while reading them XD<br>Hopefully, this chapter will answer most of your questions/requests...</p>
<p>Also, some of the powers people have specifically Loki, Stephen and Carol are from the comics so they may seem more awesome than in the MCU. :)</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Another chapter done, phew that definitely didn't take a whole day of solid writing. :)</p>
<p>What did you guys think of Captain Marvel being stronger than Thor sans Stormbreaker?<br>And what about Loki vs Dr Strange?</p>
<p>Please leave comments/questions/requests! You guy's awesomeness is what got me to write this all so fast :))))<br>and the next chapter has more IronStrange fluffiness... Maybe even a certain declaration... *cackles in an evil and yet super gay fashion*</p>
<p>Until Next time </p>
<p>:D</p>
<p>MORE AMAZING COMMENTS!!! You guys are just the best :D<br>Well here’s the next chapter with an extra serving of IronStrange fluff ;) Sorry if the actual romancy parts suck since I don’t really have that much experience in that area forever alone...</p>
<p>Speaking of romance... I... being the idiot I am, forgot to mention that the Vision/Wanda thing is one-sided for Wanda because Vis is too adorable and nice for that fiend!</p>
<p>Another thing, I finally got my hands on a Captain Marvel comic so Yay! It’s the ones from 2014 I think? anyway I got a new character from there... who I added cause why not! :)</p>
<p>Anyway, on with the chapter! :)</p>

<p>YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING!!! Thank you again for such AWESOME and KIND comments!!! </p>
<p>Finally, a new chapter is here now I have figured out how the hell I'll finish the fic :)</p>
<p>Someone asked me if I'll add Riri. I finally got a comic with her in it but don't think I'll add her to this fic as it would be a bit random but she'll probably show up in some future fic I'll write.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the chapter!</p>

<p>:)</p>
<p>Again such AMAZING comments you guys! :)))))</p>
<p>I'm going to TRY to have this fic done by next Sunday but school might be an asshole so no promises!</p>
<p>Enjoy the chapter!</p>
<p>WARNING: A bit of Homophobia in this chapter, mostly because Rogers is from the forties where all the gayness was in Berlin until the war so he kinda isn't used to that stuff. Or maybe I just want to cement the assholeyness that is Steve Rogers.</p>

<p>Thank you guys again for your awesome feedback! :) I'm now on the second page of IronStrange fics sorted by kudos!!! I feel so fulfilled :))))))</p>

<p>IM SORRY!!! <br>I know a lot of you thought that Wong would kick their asses but I need them to manage to just get away for the plot's sake. :( On the plus side, Wong injured Steve and knocked Wanda unconscious.<br>I'm so sorry Wong );</p>
<p>I'll try and get the next chapter out on Friday and then the final chapter on Sunday and don't worry the more shit the Rogues do the more consequences, and they just hurt one of Stephen's best friends and stole his Infinity Stone so up the pissedness by 50%</p>

<p>Thanks for Reading :)</p>

<p>If you want me to do a prompt then feel free to send one over and I'll check it out :) otherwise, I most likely will write several one-shots I have swimming in my mind and continue work on the fics I neglected to write this one (whoops)<br>If you want to send a prompt email me at <a href=""/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"" class=""__cf_email__"" data-cfemail=""375b47040003020619515659515e54435e585977505a565e5b1954585a"">[email protected]</a></p>

<p>for those who noticed, peter is based off the idea of peter parker because i thought it'd be cute. i didn't make it too super obvious because i think sometimes fusing two 'verses together can be tacky if not done well and i don't trust myself. all of peter's friends at the end are actual characters from spiderman so that's cool<br>pete's school is a legit place in brooklyn, it's a branch off from Carmelo the Science Fellow which sounds like an awesome place for a child so check it out if you're in the area and have young children, i guess<br>i had bucky hail from indiana and grow up in virginia because that's the way it is in the comics and i wanted a legit reason for why he wouldn't have met steve already, i hope that didn't confuse too many people<br>bucky's tattoo is from the wings stitched on the side of the jacket he wears in ca:tfa (you'll see them if you look, they match the wings steve has on his helmet which is, quite frankly, adorable)</p>"

<p>Hermione’s expression grew indignant but Draco ignored it and pressed on.</p>
<p>“I am trying to seduce you,” he said, staring her straight in the eye. Her indignation faded as her mouth dropped open and her eyes slowly grew round.</p>
<p>He continued, “I have been trying to seduce you for over two years; ever since I first brought up the idea of our having a book club together.”</p>","<p>This story was inspired by Neil Gaiman’s response to the question: What is the best way to seduce a writer?</p>
<p>“In my experience, writers tend to be really good at the inside of their own heads and imaginary people, and a lot less good at the stuff going on outside, which means that quite often if you flirt with us we will completely fail to notice, leaving everybody involved slightly uncomfortable and more than slightly unlaid.</p>
<p>So I would suggest that any attempted seduction of a writer would probably go a great deal easier for all parties if you sent them a cheerful note saying “YOU ARE INVITED TO A SEDUCTION: Please come to dinner on Friday Night. Wear the kind of clothes you would like to be seduced in.”</p>
<p>And alcohol may help, too. Or kissing. Many writers figure out that they’re being seduced or flirted with if someone is actually kissing them.”</p>

<p>its like 00:30am so I'll give it another read/tidy up in the morning, but I've been sitting on this for so long and just wanted to get it posted.</p>
<p>fun fact: i actually wrote this chapter a few months ago, got about 14k in, and then realised i'd turned chapter 6 into a story in itself. i derived from my original plot and had let my side plot of dabi and shouto really morph into something angst filled and crazy because i am, shockingly, more of an angst queen than of a fluff one. i'm tempted to post it as like, an AU ending, but who knows.</p>
<p>either way i hope you enjoyed my soft cute ending and thank you so much again for the patience whilst waiting, i can't believe started this a year ago because so much has happened since, but i can honestly say some of your comments have really stuck with me and meant the world. they also gave me the push i needed to finish this off! </p>

<p>I am SO surprised at all the feedback I am getting for this fic!??? I honestly thought I'd get maybe 10 kudos if I was lucky haha! And I didn't even THINK about comments! I just did this for the fun of it but I'm actually really happy so many people seem to enjoy the story so far! I've always been too self-conscious to contribute to my fandoms but this is actually really fun! Thank you so much for all the kudos and nice comments! The tips and pointers are greatly appreciated as well! Please let me know if you notice any repeating mistakes or ways I can improve my writing! I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Thank you for reading &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>

<p>I really hope you liked this chapter!! And I want to give another thank you to all the kudos and comments! A lot of you have given me really good advice and even some good ideas to add to the story! So thanks a lot!! &lt;3 &lt;3 Hope you all have a good day :D</p>
<p>P.s.<br>In case it's not obvious enough, the whole class is aware that these two dorks are pining for each other :P</p>

<p>WELP. THAT'S IT. THAT'S MY STORY ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ<br>I really hope you guy's liked the way I ended it! I wasn't intending to write a kissing scene cause I'm not confident enough in my writing skills but it just kind of happened and I think it turned out okay!? Anyways please tell me what you thought! Or if you have any more writing tips! Again thank you so much for the kudos and comments!! I'm still in shock at how good the response was for this story!? It's been a great first fic experience I think! &lt;3 I hope to write more about my blushy explodo boi and freckled bunny boi soon.</p>
<p>ALSOOO A little extra backstory the whole class was trying to scheme ways to get the two idiots to finally admit to there feelings for each other because its literally painful and disgusting to watch them pine for each other until one-day Izuku was telling Uraraka how he felt like Katsuki's nickname was annoying him and Kirishima happened to be in the room at the same time and he knew that Izuku calling him Bakugou would drive him nuts and so you can guess the rest lol</p>
<p>Also would like to add that Kirishima and Uraraka were trying to help and didn't think it would cause Katsuki such emotional pain and turmoil like it did.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the kind words and comments again!!! I'm so sorry if I don't get to replying to all of them! Just know I read every one and they mean a lot &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>
<p>THANK YOU FOR READING</p>
<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Soooo this is my first fic like EVER so constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated! I'm not sure if a fic like this has already been made but it popped in my head and I kept getting ideas for it so I figured why not? This a short first chapter and so far kinda basic? But other chapters will probably be a bit more lengthy and have more Izuku and Katsuki Interaction! I'm thinking it'll be 3 chapters long maybe 4! I'm not sure how consistent I have to be with chapter lengths I'm so new at this haha! I would love to hear feedback and some writing pointers since I am clearly very new at this!

<p>Ok guys, it's happened. I've proven I'm completely incapable of writing a drabble or even a short story. This idea's hooked me and I keep getting sucked back to it.</p>

<p>There will be one more chapter after this one, but I'm not 100% sure where I'm going with it. It could end happily or decidedly not so. I love these characters and I want them to be happy... but I'm not sure yet if this is that kind of a story.</p>

<p>Hey lovely readers,</p>
<p>So... we can look at this one of two ways: one, I'm an awful person because I promised this would be the last chapter and it's not or, two, there's more story for you to read! So yay? (Hopefully yay.)</p>
<p>This chapter ended up running long so I decided it would be best to split it. The last chapter will be up soon but, until then, enjoy this:</p>

<p>Yeah, Stiles is getting increasingly messed up, sorry! I do love torturing my babies, and having that much emotional control over another person would screw with anyone's head eventually. He is still Stiles; he's just on a little bit of a power trip.</p>
<p>And Peter's alive, and our boys finally have the witch! But will they get their happy ending?</p>

Please comment any weird spider/spider-man/just strange in general qualities that you might want to see next chapter and thanks again for all of you who read my stuff!</p>
<p>sooooo, you guys gave me SO many ideas to work with so there will definitely be more chapters after this! This one is focusing mainly on Peter's inability to thermoregulate because I got a LOT of requests for that one, with an extra portion on his super strength.

<p>I might be doing two or three more chapters of this depending on what I want to explore and all that, just so you know. Suggestions are always appreciated, but just know that I may not use them all. </p>
<p>There is a possibility that I'm PLANNING on Thor, Loki, and Brunnhilde joining the Avengers later on in this fic but that could change.<br>Also, you know how I said this is probably the last fic in this series, that may turn out to be a lie, but idk yet.</p>
<p>So Peter's officially in college at this point in my fic. I know I didn't do a graduation one, but I was just too lazy to, sorry guys. Maybe someday I'll go back and insert one in there, but that's why it's okay for him to skip a couple classes.

<p>Do not worry, loki and thor are eventually coming.</p>
<p>Also, someone asked me for a Skip Wescott fic, which I may actually write, but I will not be writing it in this series as it's a little late for it in this storyline and wouldn't make as much sense. If I do write it I will make a comment about it in the notes of whatever chapter I post next so that people who are only subscribed to this series can still know about it.</p>

<p>thank you all so much for your help with this fic, even those whose idea's i didn't use. it's not that your ideas weren't good, it's that i either didn't have enough space in the timeline of this fic, or i wouldn't have been able to incorporate them well enough into the story with my current writing abilities and the story still flow. </p>
<p>i do have a few more ideas for the last couple fics ( i know i said this was the last fic before, but i lied ) but they may not come in a while, so bear with me, thanks!</p>
<p>for those wishing for a longer chapter, i'm sorry that i couldn't comply, my brain has literally been a trash can for the last couple of weeks, but i hope you still like it, even though its no longer than the other ones :D</p>
<p>I may post a second chapter, but this should be the last(ish) fic in the series, so please tell me if you want another chapter in the comments. I just wanted to end it on a happy note after the angstiness of some of the others, so idk. TELL ME ALL YOUR THOUGHTS! I seriously love you guys.</p>"

<p>Update: August 2021. So I went back and reread this and added about 1.5k more words worth of porn throughout the chapters. Mostly on Chapter 2 because the flow of it when reading was least satisfying to me. If you're someone who goes back to reread, you're in for a few surprises!</p>
<p>In a rush, the memories of the previous night flood back. He's embarrassed. Oh, he's embarrassed all right. But he can't hide. Not from Venom. Who's hunger for him has become insatiable. Matched by Eddie's denial of wanting to give in completely.</p>

<p>And so the apologies begin...</p>
<p>Wow guys, I can't thank you enough for all the support I get on these works! The first fic of this series, Names, just reached 10000 hits yesterday and I just find it so unbelievable. I remember uploading it and not even expecting 100 hits, so I'm really happy right now. Everyone's support means so much and you're comments always make me smile. I don't know if anyone actually reads these notes, but I have to rant about how grateful I am somewhere, so...<br>Anyway, next chapter will (hopefully) be up within the next three days.</p>

I like this chapter because I think it also gives good insight on how I want Wanda to grow in this series.</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow! Thanks for all the support! I'll never be able to say it enough, I'm constantly blown away by all the positivity these fics receive. I love you guys!</p>

<p>Thanks for all the support on my last fic, I'm glad you all enjoyed it!

</p>
<p>Some of this may be OOC but i think a lot of it can be due to the fact that Team 7 barely knows one another and yet have to keep relying on one another to survive Kakashi's insane training. I make it sound pretty straightforward but imagine being dropped off in the woods partially naked with no supplies with three classmates you've barely talked to. I would personally go a little crazy.</p>
<p>I also think of all problems that could have been solved by a mediating adult. So Sakura, who is emotional and even described as a cry-baby early in the manga, probably would have snapped under certain circumstance. But she's logical as is Sasuke, so I think Kakashi could have fixed so much with just some little communication. They are also both impressionable young kids who look at Kakashi and see a legendary ninja (who hasn't been lazy in this world) and so they respect and listen to him.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I know i keep giving Sakura crying scenes, but as Kakashi said; tears are not a weakness. I wanted to show some of her frustration and bring back the nickname she had of 'crybaby'. She is a young girl who is dealing with being isolated with three boys, only one of which even vaguely understands her. </p>
<p>And while i think Sasuke being rude would be cannon, his apology might seem ooc. But on this idea, i reiterate that they are in isolation, and he is being given exactly what he as always wanted; training. This Sauske is a bit better than cannon because he is getting training and good attention. Kakashi gives him leeway but also doesn't allow disrespect or stubbornness from the boy, tossing him around until he is too exhausted to be a jerk.</p>
<p>As for Naruto, i feel like this is all positive attention for him and that he barely notices the fact they are isolated.There is little reason for him to be antagonistic or harping on Sasuke when Kakashi takes an active role in their lives. Kakashi also waited till he was sure they were far from Konoha and he had their trust before he told Naruto the secret of his mom.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I wanted to see the appearance of some more traditional ninja items. But so many were so interesting i couldn't just pick one for each kid! I won't focus heavily on the weapons but many of them will make multiple appearances briefly in upcoming chapters.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I think the capital town of a non-ninja village would be impressive but not unlike edo period or even earlier. The kids also do their first kill which i think a good ninja sensei would introduce in a more controlled environment than many situations. Against civilian bandits is a lot more easily handed. That it happened in defence and instict would make it easier for all of them to handle.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I feel Kakashi in cannon did Sasuke a disservice by not sitting him down and telling him he had the sharingan and how he got it. Sasuke is a traumatized child raised on stories of doujutsu theft. Kakashi could have gained his respect and trust by having a serious talk with him about it. </p>
<p>I also feel Sasuke would have thought Kakashi had a different reason for being his sensei if he hadn't known about the sharingan. </p>
<p>Kakashi is also training alongside his students so he is getting back to a good physical fitness level. He hadn't exactly let himself go, but years of lazy training and outside of ANBU had dulled him. With a little training Kakashi improves rapidly as shown by how the first fight with Itachi in the manga had him going down quick, but later on he was facing high level opponents with more ease. </p>
<p>Get ready for Wave btw. I couldn't leave it out.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_8_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I made the battle against Zabuza go a bit differently because i think as the kids changed, so has Kakashi. His reactions have changed from mess around with the opponent to kill them quickly if he doesn't want them near his kids. Also in the manga when he fights Zabuza with the sharingan and his own attacks, i think it would be risky. I mean a master of water versus a quick copy? Why not use lightening he later uses often.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_9_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>A little bit more of the team learning about one another. And some Sasuke angst. And more life lessons.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_10_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So i always hated how they never fully investigated Wave when they knew that Gato was going to try and destroy the bridge and kill Tazuna. SO here they did it, though i didn't show the scene. </p>
<p>I also never liked how they killed of Zabuza and Haku. I know it taught Naruto about loss or something and then gave some good flashbacks, but i felt like the whole thing was bleh. So Kakashi, stronger and more driven than in the manga, makes a different choice.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_11_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Timeline so far: 1 month in the forest the first time they got dropped, two weeks forest the second drop, two weeks to tea country and their base, six weeks in tea country, two weeks to wave, three weeks in wave, week and a half back to Konoha. Approx. 5 months and a few weeks. </p>
<p>I am trying to make travel time look a little more realistic, and doing ninja vs. civilian, than some stories that say places like Suna are 3 days away. Fire Country is one of the larger countries and getting around would take a while, especially in dense forests and winding roads. </p>
<p>So the team is finally back in Konoha and kakashi is already preparing them for the chunin exam!</p>
<p>As for needing a certain number of D-ranks, it shows discipline and hours spent working for Konoha. There must be some form of level needed before they can enter an exam. </p>
<p>The Hokage also demanded he enter them because its all a power play and as nice as they make the Hokage in the manga, he is still a dictator that must keep a firm grasp on his power.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_12_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I never understood why Kakashi didn't introduce his pack at some point, especially after using them in wave and such. </p>
<p>The explanation of summons is half made up, half pieced together from my knowledge of the manga and stuff. </p>
<p>The armor stuff i made up because i cant imagine heavy taijutsu fighters not using armor or others who specialize in things like long range. I know the reasons such as heavy armor decreases speed and flexibility and stealth, but they have seals to seal literal demons away, why not to make things like cloth hard. It would make more sense than someone wearing fishnet as a shirt in a fight out in the elements.</p>
<p>Gave them another new outfit too. They're kids, even if most ninja seem to pick one look and stick to it, kids get bored of the same shirt after some time. And they're still growing and finding a style. I know i don't wear the same clothes i did when i was young, or even from a year ago.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_13_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>A little more weapons training and a quick breakdown on what i think a military village would work it's pay system like. All the stories where they get paid per mission never made much sense to me. How would people dedicate time to training? And it would create such a competitive system that people would probably try and actively sabotage others to get their cash. Bounties make sense, but you would want some sort of equality in a ninja village.</p>
<p>And finally some fluff about moving into the Hatake compound.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_14_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Music therapy and D-ranks. The scene with Iruka vs. Kakashi is something i thought would be more realistic than the arguing in the manga.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_15_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Some fluffy team arguing and then some serious politics. And then the end. Or perhaps the real beginning.</p>

With people expressing interest in it, this story ended up being my early-release monthly oneshot for October. However, I had so much more I wanted to develop and ended up adding quite a bit to it before uploading it here. Thank you to my lovely supporters who voted for me to write this concept last month because I ended up really invested and enjoying this piece and I'm quite proud of it. Also, thank you for not making fun of the shitty title it originally had because I was too exhausted to think of a good title when I first posted it lol. </p>
<p><b>Verse notes:</b> This story is set before the manga arc with Fyodor and the Rats and is Dead Apple compliant. If you haven't seen Dead Apple, don't worry about it as it's not essential for understanding the story!</p>
<p>Fic title comes from the song ""Sick of Losing Soulmates"" by dodie. The entire song fits the fic perfectly so if you're interested in taking a listen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7RNQIMf76M"" rel=""nofollow"">you can find it here</a>.</p>

<p>“You,” Midoriya Izuku said and paused, thinking over the words. He sounded taken aback. “<i>You</i> want <i>me</i> to help fight All Might.”</p>
<p> “Of course,” All for One nodded along. “I can offer you double of whatever my counterpart is paying you currently, along with anything your little heart could desire. Of course, you would get to help out drastically—""</p>
<p>“Did you happen to <i>check</i> what world you were pulling me out of when you did this?” Midoriya Izuku interrupted and it was said in such an incredulous tone that had the situation not been as critical as it was, All Might would have laughed. </p>
<p>Also known as: number one hero Deku has been through a lot of things, but being thrust into an alternate reality where he’s All for One’s Successor is a first. He has to navigate this world when his alternate self is a villain who's dead-set on killing him and this version of class 1-A. All the while, his friends search desperately for a way to get him back.</p>
<p>“Whatever we’re doing, we need to do it soon,” Kirishima said, drumming his fingers on the doorframe. “Everyone’s worried, man. Villains are taking advantage of his leave. We’re all working overtime just to keep the peace and it just… It just feels kinda empty without him.”</p>
<p>Ochako put a hand on Kirishima’s shoulder. “I know. We have to be strong, though. Deku is counting on us. We’ll find him.”</p>
<p>“I promise you,” Tenya said with as much conviction as the situation offered. “I <i>promise you</i> we’ll find him.”</p>
<p>He wondered how they were going to react to Midoriya, but Midoriya was nowhere to be seen—Aizawa-sensei pulled him away two hours ago and he had yet to return.</p>
<p>“Alright, this is gonna be SICK,” Kaminari said suddenly, throwing his bag over his shoulder. He threw open the dorm door and walked inside. Not two seconds later, the door opened again and Kaminari promptly rushed back out and down the steps, looking rather terrified. “Midorishi Izuku is in our dorm.”</p>
<p>Ah, so that was where he went.</p>
<p>“Todoroki! Wait up!” Izuku called. </p>
<p>Todoroki stopped to glare at him. “What?” </p>
<p>Izuku couldn’t help but compare this Todoroki to his Shouto. The mannerisms, the anger, the fear. All of it was so familiar, yet so different.</p>
<p> Izuku offered a small, sad smile. “You are not your father. Your fire is not your father’s quirk. Who you are and what you do with your own quirk is up to you. That’s all I wanted to say.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been getting at a lot lately. I like you better than my version too,” Izuku doesn’t bother to hide his smile. He can’t help but add on, “Though, you’re missing a couple of hands.”</p>
<p>Tenko looked down at his two perfectly good hands. “I’m…what?”</p>
<p>Izuku patted his shoulder and started walking off. “Don’t worry about it. It’s better this way.”</p>
<p>“W-wait! What do you mean I’m missing a couple of hands?!”</p>","<p>want to start out by saying this is a COMPLETE story, meaning I have it ALL written out. its 40K words and six chapters long. this story will NOT be abandoned (unless something were to delete my entire document) and will receive regular updates</p>

<p>originally villain &amp; hero deku's name were the same but when u try to write a scene with characters of the same name it gets............Hard. it was too confusing to follow so i changed it. villain midoriya is called ""midorishi"" which just means green death</p>

<p>Or: Arthur's soul gets trapped outside his body and takes to following his servant around.

Mainly because I am worried that if it doesn't get a lot of response I'll get disheartened and never post the rest. And I hate not finishing things. </p>
<p>Rest assured this is complete but there is quite a lot to this fic so I thought this one was best to *nervously* post it in parts. </p>
<p>There will be six chapters in all and just under 30K word count. I'm posting chapter one and two together as chapter one is too small on its own. I will re-look over the other chapters and will be looking to post every 3-4 days wifi permitting. If you want the next chapter posting sooner... comment! Let me know. </p>
<p>Here it goes...</p>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone who commented :) I was going to post this next part tomorrow but I got it all checked and edited so I thought I would get it out early to you all!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Still a few more parts to edit and post so let me know that you are all still enjoying it. I will hopefully be able to get the next part up before the weekend (but comments make me edit faster) ;)</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone that has commented so far :) <br>Here Merlin has another run in with Lord Bodin, Arthur and Merlin go to see the Druids and figure out what has happened to Arthur.</p>
<p>Thanks for those that continue to comment :)<br>So Arthur has now seen that Merlin is smart, that his Knights listen to him, that he can strategise and plan, that he puts all before Camelot... How about Arthur witnessing some BAMF!Merlin?</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Only one planned part left :D <br>As always it is pretty much finished but I am not completely happy with the ending just yet so if you have any suggestions for what you want to see happen or anything like that feel free to send them over! Something might bash the last few paragraphs into shape.</p>
<p>First of all - thank you to everyone who has commented. I am not able to respond to them all individually but know that I really appreciate them and they have helped me push through this final chapter.<br>Secondly - I am so sorry for the wait. Life got in the way but here is the final chapter.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And that's it... for now. Arthur knows, Arthur is saved, Merlin knows Arthur knows and he is saved too. Now they can go back to Camelot, Arthur can lift the ban on magic and live happily ever after.<br>Although the story is complete as much as I had planned I am considering an epilogue... let me know if that is something you would want to see! Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed.</p>"

<p>Okay, so...I admit I went a little OOC with Harry not liking Quidditch as much as he does in canon. My reasoning was that maybe a Harry who grew up with his father, instead of trying to find a connection with him in every little thing James ever touched, may be less connected to Quidditch in this AU. I thought it worked alright, but if you disagree, I can totally get that.</p>"

Lan Wangji didn't know that Wei Wuxian was pregnant with his child before all the chaos went down, and he only realises the kid is his after he finds him and Wen Yuan in the ruins of Burial Mounds, after Wei Wuxian died.<br>Also Wen Yuan didn't lose his memories of his childhood in this AU, so him and Wangxian's child are very much like brothers.</p>

<p>In case anyone wanted to know, these are the chinese characters that make up Lan Zhenli | Lan Wangxian's name:<br>蓝珍理, which loosely translates to ""value reason/logic"". 珍 can also be used in the word 珍贵, which means precious.<br>蓝忘羡, I'm sure I don't need to explain the reasoning behind the name! But other than being a shipname, the individual terms can also be taken to mean ""forget"" and ""jealousy/envy"", which actually has pretty noble connotations if you think hard enough, which is also why I thought it was decent enough as a courtesy name.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm not really satisfied with the way this fic turned out? Wei Wuxian is a little too mature and ooc, but I'm working on the assumption that as an actual mother with a son he has a lot more reason to not be as much of a carefree happy-go-lucky type.<br>But I hope you guys like it at least!</p>

Banana flavoring is purportedly still based on the Gros Michel, though. I've seen several people expressing an interest in reading more banana fics (like gyzym <a href=""https://gyzym.tumblr.com/post/83124313687/six-fanfictions-i-am-currently-craving-the#notes"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>), so I added a scene as my little contribution :D</p>

<p>Part one of the elimination rounds. You may notice some changes. As said in the last chapter, the Oto nin were met with more resistance and less mercy from Team Seven and their absence is going to mess up the number of competitors and match-ups. Also i would never believe the Hokage would leave these match-ups to chance. Certain matches and people would need to go on to A) bring people to watch the exams, B) show off Konoha's skills, and C) they already deserve Chunin rank. </p>
<p>A little more about Naruto being more controlled and calm and a bit about Team Seven already suspicious of Kabuto.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Some more changes in the match-ups and a few different final participants. Onto the training month!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Enter Kabuto. And then immediately exit Kabuto. I just feel like Kakashi would have met a threat like Kabuto with extreme prejudice. The fact that in cannon he constantly slips away seems unrealistic when faced against geniuses like Kakashi who recognize him as a threat. And with back-up, no matter how slippery he is, doubtful he would escape a village on high alert.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Training Strategy created! Enter Team Gai!</p>
<p>Since they were more sneaky when entering the exams a while back, there was never the hallway scene with Team Gai nor did Lee and Sasuke spar. So this is their first meeting</p>
<p>Sakura might seem a little too evenly matched with Lee but I tried to explain how the kids have been getting so much more training than any of the other genin and how well they are doing. Team Gai has only had a year longer than Team Kakashi and are restricted by time more so than Team Kakashi who had six solid months of intensive training. Its like comparing the training of some kids in martial arts a few times a week to those who go to boot camp. </p>
<p>I also look at it like how in Cannon they became monsters at like 18, with Sakura surpassing Tsunade and stuff. the kids obviously have potential and it comes out with Kakashi's focus. So i don't think they're too OOC or overpowered.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Yugao to help out Sasuke and Sakura! I wanted to bring some more characters into play. </p>
<p>Also I theorized that the Hokage had to draw a lot of ninja back during the chunin exams due to foreign presence in the village. But with everyone back in the village there would be a lot of ninja with free time outside of patrolling. </p>
<p>Also enter Jiraya. I had Kakashi argue against using the Kyuubi because it seems like the history of the kyuubi jinchuriki is that they don't often use it's power, not like Naruto later does in the anime at least. With a firm hand and all the training he can take Naruto is growing into a person who doesn't need the borrowed abilities either. And while summoning is useful, it was shown in the manga itself that unless he taped the Kyuubi's power, he was unable to summon more than a tadpole, so useless right now. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the sharingan, i think the manga went the wrong way with Sasuke wanting to use it so bad. With Kakashi's guiding hand and example, Sasuke is realizing he has a way to power that doesn't rely on his eye. And after seeing his brother murder his family using them i thought there had to be some hesitation in gaining his own/using it.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Some Kakashi and Gai friendship time. I didn't like how their friendship wasn't explored more in the manga since Gai grew up with Kakashi and had such an effect on him. </p>
<p>And some Kakashi getting retrained on his tanto. The kids aren't the only ones getting some training in. </p>
<p>.--.</p>
<p>Sorry about the short length and time between updating. With school starting a new semester I have been lacking free time</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_8_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Jiraya approving of Naruto in sexy-no-jutsu form always rubbed me the wrong way. Didn't matter that he looked like an older woman, he was still a young boy. Even if Jiraya did it as a joke it is not cool. And this over-protective Kakashi does not like it, nor does Sakura. And of course Iruka will kill someone who hurts Naruto with his bare hands. It's not a huge part of the story, but in my world there is no weird leering at young boys disguised as women, especially when you should be their teacher or guardian.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_9_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>A little anti-climatic on the Jiraya fight but the fight isn't completely over. There was no way someone as powerful and favored as Jiraya would be blocked out of Naruto's life completely but Kakashi made damn sure he's going to be supervised. </p>
<p>And then a little talk on consent. Consent is sexy.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_10_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So some Iruka and Naruto time! I loved Iruka in the manga and thought he was such a good influence on Naruto. And some medic time for Sakura and Sasuke. While Sakura had the control she did in the manga, she has different motivations. Sasuke on the other hand is growing closer to his team and more concerned with their help, thus an interest in medical jutsu.</p>
<p>And then a lazy sunday with some Sasuke and Kakashi time. Sakura also doesn't see her parents as often, busy with training and stuff, but she stills has a relationship with her parents. </p>
<p>And Asuma and Kurenai! team Seven is going to interact with their age-mates fianlly.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_11_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Some more Kakashi training! And some of my own theory on genjutsu stuff.</p>
<p>And Naruto might have been raised a half feral child with very little human companionship, but Kakashi is trying to make up for that.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_12_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>A little Sakura heavy this chapter but oh well. I think Sakura's an awesome character but she does often need validation. There's nothing wrong with needing praise and encouragement. While Naruto isn't used to it but can pick up on it and Sasuke is used to empty praise but also knows he is indeed good, Sakura needs more vocal coaching. I picture her as the girl in school that was a teacher's pet, as well as a encouraged daughter, who was used to hearing how good she was and when she stops hearing that and with no back ground knowledge in ninja life from her family, she's sometimes lost and worried she's behind (especially with these teammates). So sometimes she just needs to hear she is doing good and that struggling is normal. Picture her as the kid who got good grades in secondary school effortlessly and got praised as 'smart' and then stepped into college and fell a few grade averages (or thought she did).</p>
<p>Some more weapons training and rationale why you don't see them all the time. </p>
<p>And then haircut scene because Sakura is finding more confidence in herself and expressing it in a way she has done for years (fashion). Look up Japanese boy cut for what i had in mind for Sakura's haircut (sort of bowl-cutish but more stylish). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for all the comments and kudos! for those of you hoping Jiraya appears again, don't worry, there will be ...stuff happening :)</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_13_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Sorry about the long wait! School and life caught up with me and gave me a beat down. </p>
<p>So Team Ten and Eight Vs Team Seven. While i didn't want to make Team seven too overpowered I wanted to show how much more advanced they are compared to their graduation group. they had to use a lot of quick surprise tactics to win so handily (as well as having long since studied other Konoha bloodlines and techniques) and also knowing the grounds really well (they could have trained their before or used the morning to get to know the layout while they waited). </p>
<p>If Team Ten or Eight had known before hand what they were walking into I think Team Seven would have had to fight a bit harder for their win, but as I said; lots of surprise on their side helped.</p>
<p>I just wanted some Konoha-nin interaction as well as showing how Team Seven stood with the other teams of their year.</p>
<p>Also some genius-genius interaction from Shikamaru and Kakashi, along with some more breakdown of ANBU.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_14_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>The kids realize what Kakashi wanted when he said Teamwork, and why they are good at it. </p>
<p>Then just a little bit of one on one time with each of his students as Kakashi realizes they really do consider his old manor their home.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_15_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Sorry for so many fluffy chapters lately, just trying to center where Team Seven is at emotionally and physically.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_16_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So I didn't kill of Hayate like in the manga! I couldn't bring myself to do it. I explained it away as the bit of extra training he'd been doing with Kakashi and the kids gave him just enough edge to let him survive. Just an extra bit of speed in dodging changed it from death to near-death. </p>
<p>And the kids learn about the Kyuubi. In fact they already knew. I hope no one was disappointed in the blase reveal, i just thought the two would never make a big deal of it with this much trust between them.</p>
<p>A short chapter as well, but the next one promises to be longer.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_17_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>A little sprinkle of PLOT!</p>
<p>And just our Team Seven showing how strong they are getting.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_18_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Sasuke is told his real nature affinity!</p>
<p>People realize his kids have seen Kakashi's face! And THE clipboard is back but this time focused on Kakashi while his students help mass produce barrier linking seals. </p>
<p>And a brief explanation (excuse) for why ninja don't use clones for everything. As well as a quick look at why they shout jutsu names.</p>
<p>Also Kabuto is dead so the two that Hayate caught talking weren't Baki and Kabuto but Baki and some other no-name character</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_20_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So I thought that like i'd been hinting, there is no way they didn't have a clue about the invasion. And in this Team Seven, Kakashi would never let his kids go in blind (too much of a risk), but he's not allowed to tel them, so this. But the kids are smart too, they were in cannon as well (in different ways). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sorry the chapter is so late and so short. More to come!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_21_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And so the invasion begins and the end nears.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_22_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>End of the second arch!</p>
<p>On to Part 2: The Chunin Exams! As much as things change, they stay the same, and Team Seven faces the same challenges in cannon even if they approach them differently. </p>
<p>Sasuke gets his sharingan, Sakura gets some realistic damage from having her face wailed on, and Naruto shows just what a ball of emotion he really is around his team. </p>
<p>Onto the elimination round!</p>"

<p>I have to submit a portfolio for the application for this creative writing class I’m taking but I only write fanfiction so What Do</p>
<p>This chapter. This fucking chapter. This thing was a beast. I cannot begin to tell you how much time I spent lying facedown on the ground trying to come up with something. This is like those choose your own adventure stories where you choose one of two paths that you think won’t matter but one leads you to an ice cream parlor and the other leads to actual hell. Holy God y’all. Please appreciate this one</p>

<p>If y’all havent noticed, this ones gonna be long. Like, l o n g, and I tend to break everything up into scenes as each chapter because I like writing i short bursts when I feel the emotion I properly want to convey rather than drowning out ten thousand words while pretending to feel angry. So bear with me, and if you’re nice, we might get a happy ending. Might. ;)</p>
<p>ALSO FUXKING COMMENT I LOVE ATTENTION</p>
<p>Alright, a lot of people have been saying that my characters are too OOC, but here’s the things: that’s the point. Literally all of my full length stories circulate around characters realistically reacting to their traumas, rather than them being used as catalysts or motives for ~*•fun adventures•*~ then being swept to the sidebar and forgotten (@ Both marvel AND fanfics). I write Natasha as bitter, emotionless, downright cruel because realistically her time in the red room would leave her with a disconnect towards human beings and a distrust towards human nature as a whole because her only social skills are murder. She wouldn’t be the sarcastic yet caring aunt figure everyone thinks she is. Same for Peter; deaths upon deaths for him and the crazy responsibility of being who he is would weigh way more on his personality than y’all think. Aunt May dying isn’t just a reason for peter to move in with Tony and have a party, it’s a traumatic event and he’d be super reluctant to move. Seriously, y’all. If OOC isn’t your thing don’t read my story. I may enjoy fantasy and sci-fi, but it’s all about the realism.<br>Anyways, enjoy the chapter! :)</p>
<p>It’s an information dump whooooores!!! Woohoo it’s that good falling but also rising action time because I’m transitioning from one plot to another!!!!! Get ready hoes!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I found a map of the MDZS world overlaid with a modern map of China, and Gusu seems to be right on top of Shanghai. Let’s just pretend Gusu is a 30-50 minute ride away from Shanghai, where WWX/WQ/WN works. Of course none of the major MDZS cities are located in Beijing, the only place I have actual experience living in. So why do half of the characters have a Beijing accent in the donghua?? WHAT IS THE TRUTH?</p>
<p>Some thoughts re: Sizhui’s adoption. WQ and WN weren’t in a good place (socially, economically) to adopt Wen Yuan at the time, but they fully believed the Lans would return their foster child without a problem. So of course Sizhui bursted out crying “PAPA!! I don’t wanna go!” all snot nosed while clinging onto LWJ’s. WQ’s promotion was pretty recent, so they weren’t always well off, especially after Wen Ruohan bankrupted most of the extended family.</p>

<p>BUCKLE UP BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO YUNMENG FOR NATIONAL WEEK! There, we will meet Jin Ling's family hehehe That's actually the segment I wanted to write the most while brainstorming for this fic. I can't believe the last 4 chapters have been a set up for me to indulgently write about Jin Ling's family dynamics. I ALSO PROMISE MORE WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN THE NEXT CHAPTER so pls anticipate Jingyi's fish out of the water narrative.</p>
<p>I've given up maintaining a pinyin dictionary in the end notes. In the novel, Jin Ling calls JGY ""小叔叔/xiao shushu."" Here, the title has been given to Mo Xuanyu. I had some sort of dialogue in mind for Jin Ling to explain what his shushus (paternal uncles) are doing now, but it never made it into the story. TLDR; JZX eventually hired a handful of his half brothers to work under him, partly for them to prove their worth and partly because his wife convinced him to. Why? Probably because I saw too many happy fanart of JZX/JGY/MXY as siblings</p>
<p>Looking back, I question my own transitions from english to pinyin to hanyu, especially in the WeChat section... The entire story is supposed to take place in China, in Chinese, but who even knows at this point lmao.</p>

<p>I thought, HA, FUNNY PROMPT, I can write a little joke fic about that. (LITTLE. LITTLE WAS THE WORD I WAS GOING FOR.)</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a giant tropey soup. Also set in that magical post Season 2-ish Canon-What-Canon land where everyone was still alive and nothing was wrong with the world, my plant-knowledge is totally invented, and there’s a hint of bad-friend Scott - which is not a reflection of my feelings towards Scott, but of where I feel Stiles was at at that point in the show. </p>

<p>Beta'd by the magical grimdarkfandango! Thanks for wading through this, presh!</p>
<p>Additional warnings explanations: While in a general sense the sex in this is consensual (if you don’t mind the whole mate bond stuff), the language of the first sex scene is at times fairly coercive <strong>[Edit to add:</strong> and Derek pushes past several 'no' signals from Stiles before he gets to 'yes' signals. As such, while Stiles' reluctance is more due to magical shenanigans rather than no-to-sex, the scene can read as verging on the rape/non-consent side of things], so please feel free to avoid the fic or the scene if it’ll be a problem. There is also some pretty dubious somnophilia (consent wise) which then becomes consented sex. Finally, the underage element of this fic is discussed quite openly and there are a few instances where it’s fetishised slightly. If you’d like further explanation of any of the warnings feel free to message me. :)</p>
<p>Edit edit: If you want to translate this fic, you are welcome to so long as you post the translated version to the Archive and nowhere else, and give me full credit and a link so I can share it! Thanks!</p>

I hope everyone likes it.<br>I must apologize for having to add a bit of Luther/ Allison.<br>I hate writing slash and I don't like their incestuous relationship.

<p><b>edit on 12/2/20</b> with the massive influx of kudos and comments due to the series' end, i'd like to apologize for how fucking dated this fic is. also i'd like to apologize for the random formatting breaks in the angel dialogue. i'm 100% convinced that ao3 is eating the formatting over time, as there were not nearly so many unformatted dialogue lines at the time of publishing. i may at some point go back and fix those.</p>
<p>also, this fic is <i>so fucking close</i> to having 696 comments, which is #nice. i won't turn off commenting, but be aware that if it ticks over to 697 i will be sad. let's see how long we can keep the #nice number.</p>"

<p>Hope you enjoyed, I was extra nervous about this chapter ;;</p>
<p>Comments and kudos appreciated.</p>
<p>Edit: Additional Warnings - Dubious Consent !!Spoilers!!<br>This warning will apply to this chapter and to some future chapters. I initially didn't add it because I didn't think it applied but upon further thought (inspired by reviews) I have decided better safe then sorry. The situation is, basically, Draco doesn't at this time feel like he has a choice when it comes to sex, both of them are horrid communicators in this fic and (like Ron worried) Harry has no experience with dealing with this kind of trauma and hasn't realized that Draco feels that way. So that's where the dubious part comes in.</p>
<p>The good news is: if Draco realized the situation for what it is and wasn't currently in denial about what he wants, he would have (non-dubiously) agreed to it. I promise eventually they start communicating more effectively, but as a heads up it does take them a rather long time.</p>

<p>So I vaguely recall something about how when something comes in contact with fiendfyre it is immediately consumed by it but I dont remember if that was a canon thing or just something I read in a fic but for the sake of this fic that isn't the case. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed. Comments &amp; kudos appreciated.</p>

<p>This chapter was actually a late addition, because Teddy making an appearance was such a popular request and because I felt the story needed a bit of breathing room between the previous chapter and the one that is coming next.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed! Comments and kudos appreciated.</p>
<p>Hello! Thank you for reading, I'm so glad you've made it this far.</p>
<p>As a heads up I wont be posting the week of August 2nd, as I have family visiting and I'll be far too busy cleaning that week in preparation to be able to give that chapter the editing focus it deserves. Posting should resume as normal on the 9th. </p>
<p>Thank you, I hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>This is the end of the fic, I hope you enjoyed it. If you're interested in more please feel free to let me know in comments or on twitter. I'm not sure when I'll feel up for it but I wouldn't be opposed to adding more scenes if theres anything you wanted to see, and I'm also always open to new fic ideas.</p>
<p> I currently have a bonus chapter planned to celebrate that we reached a kudos milestone, but I don't yet know when I'll be able to get that finished so its up to you if you want to keep this fic bookmarked for that. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading and I really hope you enjoyed, comments and kudos so appreciated.</p>
<p>We reached a kudos goal a while back so here's a soft little Christmas themed bonus chapter. Hope you enjoy~</p>
<p>

<p>Might do a few more of these maybe, I have a few other ideas.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed. Comments and kudos always appreciated.</p>
<p>(also if you have name suggestions for baby #2 that'd be cool, otherwise i might just go back and choose another from the ones people already gave.)</p>
<p>It’s been a long time! But I finally got around to finishing another bonus chapter. Also, this fic got a spanish translation! I’m so excited and thankful. It’s thanks to that that I found the motivation to finish this bonus chapter. <br>Thanks to the hard work of <a rel=""nofollow"">Dragonlytherin</a>, a spanish translation can now be found <a rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. <br>Also sorry in advance to any Jeremy’s out there. I just chose a random name.</p>

<p>It’s been like… almost two years (I think?) since I’ve written anything for this fic so I felt kinda rusty, hopefully it's not too different from the rest.</p>
<p>I didn't find a chance to fit much of Cyrus into this chapter but I imagined that Delilah got Harry’s hair and Draco’s eyes and that Cyrus is the opposite and got Draco’s hair and Harry’s eyes.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for the continued support. I don’t currently have anything else planned for this fic but I do have a few other Drarry fics I’m working on (just want to get them a bit closer to done before I start posting to hopefully avoid any posting gaps).</p>
<p>And as always, I hope you enjoyed.</p>

<p>Izuku freezes. Then he looks up. Todoroki Shouto is staring at him, his eyes calm but wide, dust and soot all over his face. His perfect, handsome face. He's more beautiful in person than Izuku could have imagined. </p>
<p>""You just saved all of us,"" Todoroki says again. ""What's your name?"" </p>
<p>""M-Midoriya,"" Izuku chokes out. ""Midoriya Izuku."" </p>
<p>Todoroki nods. ""Midoriya. Thank you."" </p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Midoriya Izuku is a university sophomore, a fanboy, quirkless. On the list of things he is not: a hero. </p>
<p>That's why he's more surprised than anyone when he rescues Todoroki Shouto, his favorite pro hero, from a deadly villain attack. His actions fling him into the media spotlight, grabbing the attention of the entire country, including Todoroki himself. But Todoroki actually wants to get to know him past the headlines. </p>
<p>Izuku finds himself living a story straight out of a fairy tale, one where the mysterious, handsome prince is played by the real-life superhero he has always admired. But Izuku is convinced he's the ugly duckling, not the swan; could he ever be remarkable enough to get his happily ever after?</p>","<p>A quick heads up: this fic is preemptively rated M for much later sections (and may switch to E), but could basically be rated T up to that point. I just want to avoid any surprises!</p>
<p>The most grateful thanks to RC, Ellie, and Val, for being here for this fic from the moment the idea broke to helping me finally nail down a title (especially RC, not just for creating the title banner, but who was drunk and very supportive when I first started talking about the idea for the story, and then forgot everything so that she could be re-surprised by each plot point later on)!!! You guys bore the brunt of my agonizing for many weeks and I owe it to you all for helping me make it through! &lt;3333 </p>
<p>And thanks so much to the friends who read through this ahead of time and let me ramble at them about the story (and my frustration levels) as it was coming along!!! Ainu, Cat, Karli, Jessie, Zine Stress District seagulls.... XD I really appreciate you listening and all the encouragement so, so much :')</p>
<p>Finally, onto the story. I hope you all enjoy &lt;3</p>
<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a> and <a href=""#children"">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>
<p>There's a bunch of Hollywood Science-y stuff in this chapter for which I had to do a lot of googling and fudging of details and it is probably still wrong, so please take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>There is now some <a href=""https://twitter.com/ainudraws/status/1106988026150952960"" rel=""nofollow"">really beautiful art</a> of the scene from chapter 1 when Todoroki helps patch up Izuku's cheek, courtesy of the lovely <a href=""https://twitter.com/ainudraws"" rel=""nofollow"">AinuDraws</a>! &lt;3333 Go looook tddk are so cute ;;</p>
<p>Also just so everyone's clear, because this is Very Important -- I'm imagining Todoroki is like, Chris Evans build/stature in this fic... but taller, probably. And maybe his waist is a bit less narrow. Regardless: BIG. (Also, he's around 26 years old.)</p>
<p>Good? Good. Proceed:</p>
<p>Thank you so much everyone for all the kind words and comments!!! I'm sorry I couldn't reply to all/replied late to many, but I've been reading them all week and they have encouraged me so much! This story was so self-indulgent, and it just makes me really happy to hear people are able to enjoy it along with me &lt;3</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>The ending of this chapter was really important to me in terms of the fic as a whole. In keeping with the canon divergence, this is my stand-in for two scenes from the start of Izuku's original story: it takes place on a rooftop because that is where All Might first told him there's no way for him to be a hero without a quirk; but also takes place at sunset, because that was the time of day when All Might found Izuku again to tell him he COULD be a hero, because he has something even more vital than power -- his determination and heart! </p>
<p>This story revolves around Shouto seeing that spark in him and acknowledging him as a hero from the start, and that's why I set this scene up the way I did. </p>
<p>Thanks especially once again to <a href=""https://twitter.com/reallycorking/"" rel=""nofollow"">Reallycorking</a> for her art &lt;3333 She captured exactly what I hoped for, and I'm just really grateful :)</p>

<p>Hi! Just to clear some things up that people have been asking - we will see a clash between Marinette's new and old friends - but because in this fic Season 3 basically didn't happen, we won't see Bunnix or any new heroes/villains the later episodes introduced.</p>
<p>I've planned out this fic to be around 10 chapters, but I was thinking of adding an epilogue(s) where the class confront Adrien, a full old friends meet new friends, Alya apology etc. Let me know what you think! </p>

<p>I am sorry updates have been so few and far between.

<p>I saw Endgame yesterday and this is my knee jerk reaction to it. Just started to type away and this happened. I wasn't really sure if I should post it but it feels like I just need to put it out there, y'know?<br>That being said: This is my first time writing IronDad and SpiderSon. I'm really nervous about the characterization. It's not beta'd, English is not my first language and it's been quite some time since I wrote a fic in English and there a probably a lot of commas in places they shouldn't be in. </p>
<p>Like I said, this was pretty emotional for me. </p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>You guys, I'm totally blown away by all your support and love for this fic? Like, I wasn't expecting it at all. Thank you so much!<br>Just like last time: it's not beta'd, there are probably commas in place they shouldn't be, I don't know anything about DNA tests or any details about the American school system. In fact, the only thing I'm qualified to talk about is cake and cake isn't even mentioned. <br>By the way, I do have <a href=""https://jen27ny.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">tumblr</a> if you like to talk to me over there. I'm still trying to get used to posting stuff (after several years of using it) so it's not all taht exciting right now, but I'm trying to be better. So, yeah. Maybe you can encourage me? </p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>Guys, I'm still absolutely floored by your support! I literally can't believe it. Thanks so much!</p>
<p>This chapter took so much longer than I anticipated. It's also so, so much longer than I originally planned. There is a lot of heartfelt conversations in here and, honestly, it was a bit like pulling teeth for me. I don't know why, maybe I wasn't in the right state of mind, or my own problems where just getting in the way, or I'm just really bad at writing heartfelt conversations. So that didn't help either. </p>
<p>This is not beta-read. I still don't know where to put any commas. Also, I still don't know anything about anything except cake, and there is still no cake in this story. </p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it! :)</p>"

<p>Hi everyone, just a little edit by me (rory_gone_mattie). I am so happy everyone is (still) enjoying the fic R and I wrote (and R's currently hip deep in a sequel if anyone is interested). Just to say that there been a couple of comments here and there - extremely kind comments - asking about translations and / or reposting our work. As lovely, and flattering, as that is, R and I are pretty much wanting to keep the work here, as is. If either of us learn another language fluently, I promise we'll have a go at translating ourselves :). Hope everyone is okay. All my love, M.</p>"

<p>I had originally planned for a different perspective for this chapter, but Ochako was persistent and fit in rather neatly to the story. To the poor reader who I mentioned a cliffhanger to, I'm sorry, that was this one. To the other poor reader I mentioned the timeline to, I'm sorry, that got bumped two chapters down.</p>
<p>6.20.19: I did a dum-dum and have been using Naomasa Tsukauchi as our poor detective's name rather than Tsukauchi Naomasa for 30k words. As of today, this issue is now fixed in all chapters of this and the previous fic; Tsukauchi now thinks of himself by his first name, Naomasa. People refer to him by his last name, ie. Detective Tsukauchi. His interview abbreviation has been swapped from NT to TN. And my OCD can now rest, allowing me to work on the next chapter instead of freaking out about mix ups and other consistency issues.</p>

<p>Note: I am now taking a 3-month coding bootcamp, in the hopes of getting myself a job that pays me enough to take care of my many debts. I'm very hopeful, but this bootcamp is a commitment of 12 hours each day, and an additional 20 hours each weekend. Long story short, for the next three months, I very much doubt that I'll be writing anything.</p>
<p>Holy cow, three months later, and I am a bootcamp grad! Now I just need to get myself a job that pays :D Sorry it's taken me so long to get this out to you, but I'll admit, I didn't even have time to breathe! That said, I hope you all enjoy.</p>
<p>Last, several of you have asked for a timeline to help visualize what exactly happened when. As such, there is a supplemental case file that I posted as part of this series which contains Nedzu's timeline. Hope that helps!</p>
<p>So, the world is going to hell in a hand basket. I hope that all of you are as safe and well as you can be in these uncertain times. I haven't forgotten or abandoned this story, but like a lot of people, I've been struggling these last few months. That said, this chapter gave me some serious trouble. I'm still not entirely happy with it, but I'm just gonna' post and hope for the best.</p>
<p>A side note to everyone who has taken the time to leave a comment: Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm a wreck and most days I sort of want to cover myself with a blanket and mentally retreat. Your kindness and your interest and your comments kept me going, and I have absolutely read each and every one. Probably multiple times, actually. I don't know how long it's going to take me, but I will reply to all of them as soon as I can.</p>

<p>Note: “Haven’t grown a callus in my ear yet, Detective.” // A Japanese idiom that basically means when you’re sick of hearing the same thing repeatedly, your ears build up a protective callus to block out the bullshit. Kind of similar to America’s “selective hearing.”</p>

<p>Note: I didn’t go into the first half of this chapter expecting to rehash Zootopia, but here we are.</p>
<p>Note: “hime” translates to “princess.” I reference a lot of cultural stuff in this chapter, and the original author’s note was a beast. It was so damned long, I moved it to chapter three of Izuku’s case file as supplemental material. If you’re interested in the origins of Izuku’s new name, some world-building details, and possible plans for future fics, that’s the place to be.</p>
<p>Final Note: Thank you for sticking with me on this journey. Your comments and encouragement are basically the only reason I managed to finish, and while there are some loose ends, this is the story I wanted to tell. It ends in the same place that it started, with a kid and his too-big heart, one who desires to change the world and chooses to do so by saving the people in it.</p>"

<p>Izuku and Bakugou had a long and complicated history, but most of the school was pretty sure that they understood where the two currently stood as rivals. Then Izuku's dad showed up on campus and everyone's preconceptions were mercilessly thrown out the window. In which Bakugou tries to murder a man, has a soft side and convinces his entire class the twilight zone is real.</p>
<p>Ft. Part 2: Turns out Izuku and Bakugou will work together willingly if given proper motivation. Endeavor showing up for a training exercise apparently qualifies. Aizawa is really tired of these children not asking for help and everyone else is absolutely terrified (and secretly very glad these two don't work together more often).</p>","<p>I wrote this over the span of 2 days with no beta so take it or leave it.

</p>
<p>Bakuogu might seem a little OOC in this this one, but I think that Izuku being abused would have also been highly traumatic for him particularly since he was taking on the role of Izuku's protector. So taking care of Izuku after a run-in would be really important not just for Izuku to recover, but for Bakugou too.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that if the two of them had been put up against Endeavor instead of All-Might in the final exams arc Bakugou would have suddenly decided he was all about teamwork &amp; they woulda wrecked him.</p>"

I have never been an expert superfan of the book -- I’ve read it a few times and enjoyed it immensely, especially our beloved angel/demon romcom, but I definitely am not super aware of every nuance, so my apologies if any of this contradicts canon!</p>
<p>I sped through the miniseries adaptation all in a rush and enjoyed it tremendously, especially (of course) the wonderful Aziraphale and Crowley of it all; yesterday, I found myself hankering for just a little more time with them, and so this fic was born and then -- as fics often do -- grew way more gigantic than I had anticipated! God bless Michael Sheen and David Tennant for their totally wonderful performances, and also for rhapsodizing over shipping it hard in all the behind-the-scenes interviews. This was definitely written with their particular incarnations of the characters in mind.</p>
<p>I’m sure that a ton of debate has gone on re: sexual experience and the ineffable husbands for the many years this fine fandom has blessed our world: the energy I got from the adaptation was that that was part of the human-y experience that hadn’t really been on the radar for either of them before, so that is the approach that this particular story takes! But of course, now that they’ve chosen a side (the world’s side, specifically), they’ve got all those pesky human feelings fully kicking in ...</p>
<p>Thanks to -- of course -- Queen for the title, which is from ""Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy."" I HAD TO.</p>
<p>This is the first of five chapters. I originally meant for it to be a one-shot but decided to divvy it up for organization's sake. The rest of the installments are already written and just need a little more polishing up, so fortunately, there won't be much of a wait!</p>

Six thousand years ago, when Aziraphale had met Crowley on the wall of Eden, watching the first two humans set out to begin the rest of history, something deep within him, more central even than his Grace, had thought, oh, it’s you, and that had been enough for him--for both of them, he assumed--for three millennia.</p>

<p>Hello again all you lovely people!<br>There are...so...many.....of you. I was not expecting this to get so much attention, but I'm really happy this many people like my story! All of your comments were so nice and I love every one of you. I know I only posted this story yesterday, but I'm too excited over people reading my stuff to wait longer. Enjoy :)</p>

<p>I hope you liked this chapter! We'll see if I can go more than a day without posting again </p>
<p>In other news, I have another story! If you like lovecraftian sort of writing (without the racism and sexism, that is) then you might like it! Hope you all have a good day/night!</p>
<p>Hello amazing people!<br>As some of you know, I do not like Endeavor. At all. So a part of this chapter might have been a direct result of that. Hope you like it!</p>

<p>Knowing me, the next chapter will be out tomorrow. BUT I have a question. Would you guys like it if I made this into a full length story? I've been debating on it because I've sort of fallen in love with this idea, so what do you guys think? This one will be finished either way. Feel free to comment ideas too, I'll write them down and maybe put them in the long version if I end up writing it :D</p>
<p>All of your comments make my day :) I love reading what everyone thinks and all the funny things everyone comments</p>
<p>Hello and good day/night to everyone!<br>You guys, there were so many of you wanting a full length fic. I literally just sat there staring at al the comment for a good 30 minutes in shock from how many people like this. FULL LENGTH FIC IT IS! If you have any ideas you want me to include then feel free to comment them! This part will be finished first, but that obviously won't take long. <br>In other news: we have reached over 100 Kudos and almost 1,000 hits! I am just so happy that many people like this little idea I had. Enjoy the chapter!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Next one will probably be out tomorrow! As I said in the beginning notes, I will be posting a full length fic based off of this idea! Any ideas (silly or otherwise) would be greatly appreciated! I read every comment even if I don't reply to them, and so far a lot of them have made me laugh :D I love you all, have a great day/night!</p>
<p>Random Fun Fact: Google docs keeps wanting to correct ""Stain's"" to ""Stalin's."" So apparently the hero killer is Russian now</p>
<p>Happy Fourth of July everyone! <br>The full version of this fic is under way! I like to work with a backlog of chapter, so it'll probably come out in a week or two, depending on how much time I have to write. Anyway, enjoy the chapter!</p>
<p>**Warning**: this is where the violence tag comes in</p>
<p>

<p>Last chapter will probably come out in a day or two, since I have to finish it off and edit it. Hope you enjoyed this one! All of your comments make me smile, so thank you for commenting everyone :D</p>
<p>Hello my lovely readers! <br>LAST ONE! For this part at least. Full one should be up in a week or so! So keep an eye out for that! <br>I'm going to go ahead and ask this here, but should I include ships? If you want to recommend one to write in then I can try to do that! I ship most things in this fandom, so it doesn't really matter to me which ones are included (Probably going to write ShinKami though, that ship is adorable)<br>Hope you enjoy this final chapter!</p>

Comments and Kudos, kids, they save stories. <br>In other news, I created an outline! I don't know how many chapters it's gonna be, but I do know what's gonna happen. I'm not gonna tell you guys when I'll update because then I'll feel even more guilty if I fall off the face of the earth again, but I'm glad you're all as excited to read this story as I am to write it.</p>
<p>So, I wasn't planning on publishing this chapter for another few days, but I've written a little bit ahead and am loving reading your reactions, so... yeah! You get it early! <br>Ok, disclaimer, I know nothing about the legal systems in France and I wasn't able to find much in 30 seconds of googling, so I just based some of these on laws where I live. Sorry if it's not completely accurate, but this is just a fic and we are not bound by the laws of reality here, so deal with it. Thank you!</p>

<p>- There will probably be more of this if people want it???<br>- The title of this story, like 'rock'n'roll buckaroo', is a quote from buzzfeed unsolved.<br>- The New Vegas v Fallout 4 argument is one I've had with my brother before. (New Vegas for life). Then after writing it I realized I'd written Shigaraki liking a game where (SPOILERS) the central plot twist is that the villain is a child who was ripped away from his family and raised to lead a sinister villainous organization... and then I made myself sad.</p>

<p>i didn't give natsu much focus in my todofam month fics and he deserves better, so he's the star of the show here. it's important that you all know that natsuo is taller than every single league member with a canon height. also he is indeed a med student! he studies medical welfare. i know he's canonically heat-sensitive but i still really like the hc of him being quirkless.</p>
<p>korusukan-ku is named after coruscant, of course, following in horikoshi's proud tradition of naming everything after star wars places (see: musutafu, kamino, hosu). yes, storming tartarus is a reference to the area 51 raid, what a time to be alive.</p>
<p>ALSO my good pal <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/users/Saccha/pseuds/Saccha"" rel=""nofollow"">Sacchari</a> decided to write the <b>VERY NSFW</b> <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjOM6SVYR-qSt4V3f2I7Ny6o2Z__EgcYqXrCiauDskQ/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">thirsty tweets</a> from the video at the start of this episode. i would disintegrate my phone too. </p>
<p>the response to every story in this universe has been absolutely mind blowing, thank you guys so much. i definitely have more stories i want to tell in this series- i want to do something following up on the deku bit at the end of this story, something focusing on a certain winged someone who's spent the story so far desperately trying to avoid getting caught in the league's videos, and, of course, more hero theory, as well as maybe others. </p>
<p>i can't promise when any of those will be finished, since i'm currently very busy and i like to take my time on these stories, and they take longer since each is more or less self-contained, because i don't want to ever leave you guys hanging, but i definitely want to write them.</p>

And if so, can Izuku be the 'voice of kindness' that helps him through his troubles like with so many others?<br>Tanaka-jiji will play a semi important role in introducing a character, and he was their first customer. He's like a good family acquaintance at this point. </p>
<p>Eri is growing up, and getting a personality. How will Izuku take it as she becomes independent now that Kai is gone and she's getting older? This is part of the goals with this fic, seeing how Izuku would handle juggling his protective streak and knowledge that Eri isn't helpless.</p>
<p>Finally, Hitoshi showed up! Whoo, any other 1-A or other characters you want to see, let me know!<br>Have a great week!</p>
<p>Sooo, I have a fellow author who owns a discord. They decided to let me use their server so both our sets of fans can meet in one place. Maybe one day I'll have my own server, but right now I'm too busy to manage it! You just click the link below and get the role 'The Riku' for updates on when I post, to talk, ect. I write for both Naruto and My Hero Academia (as does the other author) so you guys will have plenty to talk about and read!<br>https://discord.gg/UwKSTr<br>P.S (on of Plasma Assassin's awesome stories here)<br>https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12961436/1/Naruto-The-Devilish-Sage</p>

</p>
<p>Wow! That was a hard chapter, honestly. It was going one way, then I made it go another. Anyways, how was it? Doesn't the moment with Shinsou just show true friendship? No pairings in this fic, but I do appreciate friendship being shown.</p>
<p>Eri and Izuku goes to the festival! While I probably won't write much about the festival, more about what Izuku and Eri do, as well as how they stumble across another lost soul.</p>
<p>Nezu is interested, though right now it's bc he think the kid is a weird little fan who makes amazing tea. Will Izuku keep his interests down or will he let his job leak out?</p>
<p>Finally, Inko. Izuku is like that kid that grows up seeing their parents doing something not completely right, and doesn't overthink it till they get older. Does Inko have ties to the LOV? Who knows! We'll find out, but Izuku is trying to put his emotions back together after seeing a man that actively tried to harm his friends (and is on his 'investigate and destroy' list) dancing with his mother. Maybe it was before villainy but he's still shocked. Talking to Shinsou helps him realize that... his mother wasn't perfect. She's human, and while she may be amazing, not everything she did would be without fault, no matter the intent or how it turns out. It makes Izuku more human, I think. </p>
<p>Anyways, please enjoy and see you next time!</p>
<p>Oh, and go check out 'Canary'. It's an mha fic that's amazing! You guys would probably love it, as it has a lot of growth for Izuku in it.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So, I'm not overly happy with this chapter. Yes, it took a whole lot of effort and it's 'good', but... I really had to stop myself from foreshadowing too much! And being careful with Kurogiri's part... not to mention the whole Sports Festival. <br>Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed this! The chat part was probably my favorite section to write, as it was a random 2am decision on my part. School has started so updates are slower (that's what I get for applying for 2 jobs and taking 19 hours kill me.) <br>-Katsuki, Katsuki. I love his character growth in manga, so don't worry! But... he is a jerk before he and Izuku hash it out. This is my version of how that kind of 'understanding' happens.<br>-The League is moving, how will Izuku take it next chapter when a certain confession of sorts is found by our green bean? <br>-Nezu... you poor rat, you and Izuku get your tea time next chapter! I just wanted to end dramatically, chapter 5 already has about 2k words tbh. <br>Finally, if any of you are in the path of the Florida huricane, know that I'm praying for your safety. Please stay safe everyone in the path of storms. Downloading stories from AO3 will help pass the time, LIIIIKE:<br>1. Canary (amazing 'Izuku has a voice quirk with a mentor Present Mic that we didn't know we needed)<br>2. Who's kid is this (short but amazing).<br>3. Arson (just updated again and I love it- more serious but cool)<br>4. With Love Comes the Pain (Seriously, top 5 fics and it updates regularly. It even has adopted Izuku!)<br>5.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Okay! Phew, I cut a whoooole lot as it was rambling, and to make sure the next chapter contains the meeting with Nezu as well as what he found in that last sentence. Lots of foreshadowing.</p>
<p>-This thing with Bakugou was planned! Promised. However, I, like many others, believe there are signs of abuse towards the annoying Pomeranian in cannon. Just looking at how he interacts with his mother after Kamino is enough. So, I fixed it. He's not redeemed, the plot won't allow it...yet. He still has to get taken out of the environment, grow, and face the wrath of the UA teachers when they catch him saying something...not nice... to Eri later on. That will be fun. Don't crucify him please. He's a minor character, but he plays a part in Izuku fully moving on from his past of bullying and in the final chapter.</p>
<p>-Facing off against Nezu, oh my! This will be interesting, and I hope the cliffhanger was alright. I'm taking 19 hours, starting a job at both a music studio and as a private lessons teacher at a school, not to mention my other stories... so updates are erractic. Reviews revive me though! I need some ideas for where you guys would hide clues for something important. Inko has some secrets getting revealed but more are to be hidden for her little Izu-chan to find. Soooo...ideas? Please and thanks, scavenger hunts- even short and somewhat easy ones- are not my strong suit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- FINALLY! Check out these fantastic stories (and lemme know if you guys have recommendations for me to read or have enjoyed any of these stories)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Worthless Necessity (really awesome story with compelling narration and angst, as well as a cat companion!)<br> - Reflex<br>-Izuku Eats His Problems (one of my personal favorites as Izuku is a Flerkin)</p>

<p>-Big thanks to Dragon, the amazing beta that made this possible. We had sooo many read throughs of this chapter.<br>-Nezu you rat. Of course Izu is perfect for the case. Too bad you don't know just how invested he is.<br>- Finally, changed how we were going to go about having Izuku finding his mother's past. There's still more to discover, but he already has her journal, so what now? O.o</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-p.s Go look at these stories for a good read.<br>1. Worthless Necessity<br>2. Decker (I just started reading it, Aizawa is a hoot in it.)<br>3. Hero for Heroes<br>4. Canary (I hear a new chapter is due soon and their discord is really chill)</p>

<p>Wooh! Another chapter. How will Stain defeat Stain without...actually fighting? And what's Sho Kurogiri going to do when it finally comes out what Inko's child has been up to while he battles his own inner demons?<br>- I wrote this while sleep deprived but my awesome beta Dragon seems to think it was going alright, so please enjoy.<br>- I just started posting these stories on my ff.net account so if you prefer that interface feel free to use that site instead.<br>- Finally, only 3 (maybe 4 if I add a certain plot point) left so let's finish off strong!</p>
<p>Finally... Discord!<br>https://discord.gg/NP5N6St</p>
<p>Have a great week everyone,<br>Riku</p>

<p>Sooo… how many are either a) biting their nails, b) preparing to kill me for doing that to Eri, or c) both? Seriously, me and the awesome beta, Dragon, felt horrible for doing this to Eri! Buuuuutt….<br>- What exactly does AFO want with her?<br>- What is this 'hope' mentioned at the end?<br>- Chisaki? What even?<br>- Will Izuku ever get a break? And if so, when?!<br>Seriously, I hope you enjoyed the chapter, but it's late sooo....<br>Discord!<br>https://discord.gg/k9KvXYt</p>
<p>Annnnd... Have a great week!<br>-Riku, out.</p>
<p>Update: I went in and...kinda figured out how to add the spaces? Hopefully, this fixes it! Again, the ending is a bit rushed... apologies! However, think of this as an opportunity to write your own ending/epilogue and have fun with it!</p>

<p>End!<br>Well, that’s literally the end of ‘The Coffee Shop Hero’ everyone. I am so thankful for you all and your support. This has been… a long journey despite being less than a year and only ten chapters. A couple of things:<br>1. If you have the time, let me know how you liked the series as a whole and the chapter please. I tried to make this as realistic as possible while not going straight to canon for Kamino since… well canon is boring when you have fanfiction.<br>2. Yes… I know who Kurogiri really is. But don’t spoil it for others! I went with what was known when I started lol.<br>2.5 Where was Shigaraki? Well... that's for you all to ponder on!<br>3. I apologize for the long wait. The few threats I got for chapter eight kind of sucked the joy of writing this work for awhile. My beta, Dragon, was ticked at them and I couldn’t agree more. But… we finished! Yay!<br>4. Sequel?<br>……. Maybe? I don’t know yet. Coffee Shop Hero was a beast, but rewarding. But! No matter if I upload a sequel or not, I would love to see you guys write some! Just let me know if you’re going to so I can check them out and give you lots of gushes of happiness.<br>5. Finally, this chapter totaled thirteen hours of writing, plus six of when I started it before but changed some premises. I loved doing it, but now I need a nap (even though I’m currently in my PJs haha).<br>Again, I am so thankful for you all, and look forward to writing more stories for you!<br>(ps. Join our discord . Shout out to Dragon my beta- may you survive this semester!)<br>https://discord.gg/MjrNGYb</p>
<p>Heyo! I hope this intrigues all you guys! It's just an idea I had. I love fics where Izuku raises Eri, or becomes an unlikely hero. Inko in cannon intrigued me, and I wanted to write how she might react to finding out she was going to die while trying to believe in Izuku's dream. Anyways, I was inspired by a fic I read awhile ago where Izuku took out the Yakuza to save Eri and owns a shop. I can't remember the name, but it was reaaally good. However, Izuku won't be taking the Yakuza out. I could totally see the cannon pre- quirk Izuku using his abilities to lead the police to Chisaki Kai though. </p>
<p>Finally, let me know what you think!</p>"

<p>I hope you enjoyed!! I wrote this while sneezing non-stop in my bed with a terrible sinus headache. 🤕 It was really fun to write, so I hope it was as fun for you to read! Please comment below :D I love reading feedback, comments and reactions to the story! Have a good BakuDeku rest of your day!</p>
<p>So, I lied. This is going to be five chapters. </p>
<p>Not because of extension of plot, but because I went really H.A.M on the fight scene and felt like it would be a good stopping point! All of my older readers who have read my other two stories/currently reading Incinerate know I love a good action scene and climax! So this was a treat to write. Fight/suspense things are my niche :) </p>
<p>Okay, I hope you enjoy! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <b>Warnings: Sexism, Alphas MMA fighting so naturally Kacchan loses his shit. Also this is Un'beta'd! Please ignore any typos and grammar errors you may find. This is purely for fun :)! </b></p>

So many people have contributed to the making of this fic--from helping to flesh out this universe, to helping fund it, to supporting me through the long process of writing this beast, to being a beta reader. Can you believe this thing was originally going to be ~15k? Final word count is closer to 45k.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has been involved along the way. This fic wouldn’t exist without every one of you x</p>

<p>I want to start by saying a HUGE thank you to everyone for your ongoing support with this fic. I’ve been blown away by the love this fic received both on ao3 and on tumblr. The atla fandom is such a welcoming and fun space and I love you all a lot xx</p>
<p>Now for the hard part: I have to admit that this fic got ahead of me. I originally intended to make this a full series rewrite, but the plot grew out of control and it’s been almost 5 years of me trying to wrangle it with limited success. It’s time to finally admit defeat. I considered leaving this fic uncompleted, but the consensus on my tumblr seemed to be that people wanted to see the rest of my unfinished draft. So here it is! Half of Book 2 is done and there’s some very brief scenes of what was going to be Book 3 at the end of this chapter. <b>Please note that this chapter is unfinished/technically my wip and so has missing scenes and plot holes.</b> There won’t be a chapter 3 like I’d originally intended, but I’ve included some of my notes/ideas at the end. There’s also some old posts on my tumblr under the ‘tea boat au’ if you want to live in this universe for a little longer.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to write for this universe or pick up chapter 3 in my stead, please feel free! I’m more than happy for people to play in the space.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your love xx happy reading</p>

<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>As you can see, events are passed very quickly when Izuku has no direct involvement, because it is written from his perspective of the situation.<br>And about Bakugou, don't worry, they'll soon make up on their own way.<br>See you in the next chapter.<br>That due to my anxiety will be soon</p>

</p>
<p>No art in this one :(<br>I couldn't resist using the “can I ask you a question?”<br>Just one more chapter and then the epilogue. The next one was one of the hardest to write, but also one of the most important dialogues for me.<br>See ya!</p>
<p>Warnings in this chapter: The abuse Izuku suffered is told in this chapter, although there is nothing explicit or detailed, just mentioned, read carefully if there are triggers. There are mentions of paedophilia, child abuse (physical, psychological and sexual), captivity and trauma. For those who want to skip these parts of the conversation, there is a summary of the most important points in the final notes.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>- Izuku tells how his kidnapper had a mind control quirk, but this one didn't work on everyone. The greater the stubbornness of people the more easily the effects were broken. This happened to Izuku and also to Inko. Remember the man she said that she had seen? He tried to use his quirk on her so she wouldn't go after Izuku. </p>
<p>-Izuku was held captive for a long time and eventually, his kidnapper brought Inko. Inko went out of mind control to help Izuku, but she couldn't fight him and was going to be killed. Izuku's quirk awoke to save Inko, but she was very close to him and was caught in the attack. His quirk killed her by accident. That was the trauma that made him forget.</p>
<p>-Aizawa learns that All Might and Naomasa always suspected that Inko was no longer alive after a conversation with Nighteye. All Might tells how he met Izuku before and that after the attack in which he saved Bakugou he went after Izuku to talk, but did not find him anymore, as he had already been taken by the abductor on his return home. He felt guilty and so did everything to find him and in the process he and Inko became friends.</p>
<p>-Aizawa learns all about the kidnapper, how he had done this before with other kids and how he was a guy whom nothing was suspected.</p>
<p>-Aizawa helps Izuku start dealing with the trauma.</p>
<p>PS: Yes, Schrodinger's cat has always been Inko, that why in the cover it's green. Izuku didn't know if Inko was dead or alive, until he opened the 'box'.</p>
<p>Art from Clara, again!</p>
<p>Next time, Epilogue and we'll have a little extra chapter with Tokoyami, about Izuku's quirk.<br>Thank you so much for all the comments, art and feedback. I'm really happy that you guys liked it.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And that's it.<br>The art of this chapter is also Clara's.<br>I only have one thing to say at the end, as I wrote this I imagined the things I wanted to hear that would have helped me, but I wasn't sure if I could get it right. It is impossible to put yourself in other people's exact shoes because each one carries their pain differently. When I showed the conversation between Izuku and Aizawa to my wonderful friend Milly, she approved and said: “Aizawa basically used Scott McCall's psychology, that of the anchor, remember? Izuku is not alone in this, it is good that he knows it. He's so afraid of his quirk and it must be so refreshing to feel that he can have an anchor for everything he's going through. Not as something to stick you in place and keep you from moving on, but as something to keep you from drifting and getting lost. ”</p>
<p>And I think that defines everything I need to say.</p>
<p>Stay well and I hope you enjoyed this tour with me.<br>We'll have just a little extra soon. It'll pass before and after the epilogue, it is about Izuku's quirk. Just a fluffy funny thing with my favourite bird boy, Tokoyami. Remember when Izuku said that he was helping him?</p>
<p>And here is the litte extra that I talked about.<br>Just some fluffy and more about Izuku's quirk and, of course, our bird boy.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Aizawa walking with his two white haired children following him like ducklings, in company of our mama cat, Mochi, who is also a amazing babysitter for sad children.<br>A concept.<br>Also: Legacy, as a monster cat, following Todoroki around with Izuku like a lovesick puppy, because he is so warm. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for all the amazing feedback. This means a lot for me. :)<br>I'll leave you with my tumblr if you wanna follow my content: https://aeronocacto.tumblr.com/<br>And if you enjoyed the art, here is the page of the artist: https://crazyclarabr.tumblr.com</p>
<p>Edit: Now we have art in this chapter too</p>
<p>The cover was made by Clara (https://crazyclarabr.tumblr.com), as well as the art that appear in the chapters.</p>
<p>About Izuku's quirk: I got her initial idea after reading the wonderful fanfic Stygian Fire by LadyGreenFrisbe. Although they are different (in Stygian fire it's a fire quirk) I loved the concept of his quirk having a mind of its own and needing fuel, and I incorporated that here. The rest have some similarities to a certain quirk of a certain character, which you will notice later. And of course, laws of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Now, counting the inspiration that made me write this: I watched again The Lovely Bones and wondered what would have happened if Susie Salmon had managed to escape her killer. This movie always makes me sad, for all she could have been. Izuku is Susie who escaped, but will have to take what happened to him forever..</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you like the premise. Tell me what you think!</p>"

It kills me. Especially bc Balinor is really the only one who can control them so Arthur is really just getting bullied by Balinor's minions. Welcome to the family lol. </p>

<p>About the linguistics: <br>I'm not 100% certain that Arendelle would be speaking English (matter of fact, I'm pretty sure they'd be speaking some form of Scandinavian dialect) but since the movie isn't true-to-time in several senses of the word, I'm taking a little bit of liberty and claiming that they're an English-speaking nation. This is mostly because there's a lot more material available to me about the transition between Chinese dialects and English than there are about Chinese to Scandinavian; additionally it was really hard for my brain to cope with the disparity of writing dialogue in English that wasn't really in English.</p>
<p>About the castle of Arendelle:<br>It's poorly designed in the movie and I'm giving it all the proper parts so it has a keep now, and a properly fortified barbican. Arendelle's a tiny nation and there are vikings in the world.</p>
<p>Sorry about the space between updates. Grad school kicked back in and I'm doing my best to juggle.<br>Plus if I'm being honest the last couple of weeks have been pretty difficult in a world-on-fire sort of way for me (yes, that was a Sarah McLachlan reference, thank you) and it's pretty hard to write Disney fan fiction when you feel like not doing that.</p>

<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>I know I've been gone for a while. Things have been pretty terrible on my end. Mental health issues and a few Hospital visits have pretty much taken up my time in the past few months, but even that can't compare to the biggest hit I took. </p>
<p>I lost my Mom in April to Cancer.</p>
<p>Even today it still doesn't feel real. I still can't look at any of her pictures without crying. Everything reminds me of her, reminds me that she is gone and I didnt even get a chance to say goodbye. But through the sadness and tears, funnily enough the reviews I would get, the knowledge that people enjoyed what I put out, it was one of the things that helped me. It meant so much to me to see my silly insignifiant little stories could make people happy during this time that is so hard for everyone and I found my will to write again and when I started I couldn’t stop. ^^</p>
<p>I might sound like a ridiculous sap for saying so , but thank you guys, thank you so much for helping me, for kicking me back into gear. Even if all you were doing was just enjoying a cracky fluffy fic.</p>

</p>
<p>Yeah, someone needs to get me away from my laptop, because now that I've started, I can't seem to stop writing for this fandom.</p>
<p>And also this MDZS has so much angst potential. I usually stay the hell away from writing angst because I really struggle with it, but like...I get my laptop out and these characters practically write themselves haha</p>
<p>Anyway, this was painful to write, but I guess WWX would've died anyway, and in a way more painful way...but he just really misses his husband, and wants to go back to their happy, domestic life, and I'm 100% going to be reuniting them next chapter.</p>
<p>(Also, in case there's any confusion, WWX is the only one who has time traveled here, not LWJ too).</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Okay, so I ended up splitting this into an extra chapter because I have no self control. So the next chapter will have more Wangxian fluff, Wei Wuxian finding out what happened after his death, and, because there was no way I wasn't including this, a Yunmeng sibs reunion! </p>
<p>The next chapter will also explain what happened to the Wens (not a happy outcome, unfortunately, but I really couldn't find a way to get around this considering the point in the timeline they were at), and how Sizhui survived.</p>
<p>Also - if anyone's wondering why Wei Wuxian hasn't really thought about JYL much, I plan to go over that more in the next chapter, but basically, he's kind of blocked it all out because he's genuinely terrified of even starting to believe that she could be alive, only to have his hopes crushed. So right now, he's not thinking about it, because he genuinely can't process that something like that could be real. </p>
<p>Anyway, hope you enjoyed this chapter! Basically just heaps of Wangxian feels to make up for the pain of the last chapter. Hopefully I get get the next part out soon - I'd like to do it by this weekend, but I do have my last exam coming up, so let's see how that goes haha.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And it's done! Sorry for the delay on this chapter guys, I was really struggling with the beginning. Like, I knew exactly what I wanted from their reunions, I just didn't know how to connect those scenes. This chapter ended up being way longer than the other ones anyway, so hopefully that made up for it</p>
<p>A few endnotes:</p>
<p>1) I really condensed the canon amount of time between Mo Manor and Dafan Mountain...I'm pretty sure WWX took a few days to get there canonically? But I literally could not find a way to fill up that time, nor a reason for why WWX would delay telling LWJ the truth for so long. But I really wanted his meeting with JC + the revelation of Shijie's survival to happen before he had his full convo with LWJ. So. The time between those two was a lot shorter, but it doesn't really affect the story much so meh</p>
<p>2) JC notices that it's WWX - or at least hopes that it might be WWX - because, since he and JYL both knew their brother was in love with LWJ, JC is a lot more aware of LWJ, and knows about his feelings for WWX. He also knows how much LWJ loves WWX, and how he hasn't moved on even after thirteen years because a) like JYL said, they were all grieving for the same person, and didn't exactly have many people who could understand that and b) I headcanon JYL and LWJ actually getting quite close after WWX's death, and JYL realises that LWJ returned her brother's feelings, and she's obviously going to be telling JC all about that. So JC immediately saw this guy clinging to LWJ, and LWJ casually wrapping an arm around his waist and holding him tenderly, and instantly goes, ""huh, this is sus...""</p>
<p>3) Someone asked about the Stygian Tiger Seal in the last chapter and hahaha...I kind of forgot all about that...but hey I mostly wrote this fic because I just wanted a bunch of really fluffy character reunions, so let's just ignore what happened to it for now, okay? xD </p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading this story, and all you're lovely comments! I definitely wasn't expecting this much attention for this story, and I appreciate all of you guys so much! I'll definitely be writing more for this fandom in the future, so keep an eye out!</p>"

I first should preface this with an updated on my Voltron stories for anyone who follows me for that: I have about half of the next chapter of <i>long live the queen</i> written, so hopefully I'll get to finishing that within the next week or so! But on to this story in particular- I got Avatar the Last Airbender on Blu-Ray recently and have been rewatching the series in my spare time, so of course, me being me, I instantly start thinking of Totally Self-Indulgent AUs because this is what I do. I feel like my two favorite Avatar characters being Zuko and Toph should come as a total non-surprise to anyone, so alas, how sad it is that the two never got that life-changing field trip.</p>
<p>But what's better than a life-changing field trip? An AU where Toph gets to hog Zuko for three whole years. Hence this. The title is taken from kintsugi, the art of repairing damaged pottery with gold, which felt extremely fitting for an au that focuses on everyone's favorite earth and fire benders. I plan to write a lot more for this, and actually have a lot of stuff planned, but updates will probably be sporadic bc I've got all that Voltron fic to get back to working on as well. Just had to get this one out of me while I had the chance!</p>
<p>Also a special shout out to my good buddy Kit for listening to me ramble about this AU for like... hours, over the course of several days. They know all the secrets now.</p>

<p>((Also. Let’s be very honest here. If this were canon and Harry had met Nimmy, he would have probably named her Godrica after Godric Gryffindor because of her colours. Smh.))</p>

<p>anyways. i know Charlus and Dorea AREN’T harry’s grandparents but like :/// c’mom man, i feel like these two are so much better than Fleamont and Euphumia. idk why. it’s honestly just a better headcanon.</p>

<p>right. okay. this update is VERY late but at least its fucking here. originally, i hadn't planned for tom and harry to meet at the ball but plans ~ change ~ they changed because the majority of you guys (yes, you, my reader) had wanted them to finally meet so BOOM. there you go. there's that mess. have fun with it.</p>
<p>if this chapter seems iffy its because i had a lovely encounter with pneumonia and when that cleared out, well mostly, i caught strep throat and basically i wrote this inn between the breaks of my fever. i hope this isn't as catastrophic as it seems to me. </p>
<p>I'll try to respond to comments when I find the time. </p>

<p>When I started writing this fic about a year ago, I thought I could get it out in a few months, tops.

<p>i spent longer formatting this fic than i did writing it i stg. technically, i wrote this for sengen week, but i didn't want to follow a specific theme. i've been wanting to do a wrong number au for this pairing for a while so i decided, in the spirit of sengen week, to just go for it.</p>
<p>i've tested this fic on my android phone, my apple ipad, and my windows laptop and it looks fine, so fingers crossed everyone can see it as it's meant to be seen. make sure you don't hide the author's style bc my knowledge of the html for this fic is so tenuous, any change will render the whole thing unreadable.</p>
<p>i'll be honest, these characters aren't easy to write. i tried to keep them as in-character as possible. senku is, of course, a know-it-all, but i always got the impression gen was very proficient with soft sciences and cultural studies. and we get like no info about his background in the series, so i'm just making it up lol.</p>
<p>hope you enjoy!!</p>
<p>oh my goodness...this really got away from me. it careened wildly off the rails into completely unplanned territory, but I'm incredibly pleased with how it turned out and I hope you enjoy it too!!</p>
<p>several people expressed disappointment that the 2nd part wouldn't have text convos, but fear not! I loved writing them too much not to include some. the ones featured here aren't necessarily in chronological order and they don't always directly relate to the surrounding sections, but they do inform the narrative a bit more, plus they're just cute to read!! I think I ironed out all the formatting bugs, but if you see something weird, let me know!</p>

<p>Wow, it's been a long time since this was updated. Fear not, though, this story is not forgotten and I finally got around to writing the next chapter. I'll do my very best to make the next update a bit quicker this time.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Your comments and support keep me writing.</p>
<p>No, this story has not been abandoned or forgotten. I've got the rest of it plotted out now and I expect to need another 5 to 10 chapters to finish it, which I will try to do within a reasonable time-frame. </p>
<p>Thank you all for sticking with this story, even after all this time. Seeing your comments keeps me motivated to see it finished. Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>Yes, an update. I swear, I'm going to do my very best to get the next chapter out a bit sooner. In fact, I've made it my mission now to actually finish this story. Finally. </p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and your support. Do let me know what you think. Your comments give me life.</p>
<p>Another update, because I'm determined to finish this fic now that we're so close to the end. There's still a bit of plot left, because naturally, Dumbledore will have something to say about these recent developments. </p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and support. Let me know what you think! Your comments mean more to me than I can possibly say.</p>
<p>We're almost at the end. One more chapter to go!</p>
<p>Thanks for all your patience with this story. It took me a while to tell it, but I did have an excellent time writing it along the way. Thanks for reading. Let me know what you think! Your comments keep my writing going, always.</p>
<p>This story is now officially completed! It only took me two years to write, but we got there in the end. I had a lot of fun writing this story and I hope you all had just as much fun reading it.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for all your patience and your support. Hearing from you kept me determined to finish this one eventually.</p>

<p>Tony brought in Spider Man to capture Team Cap with as little confrontation as possible. What if he decided it wasn't worth it after Scott's stunt with the fuel truck.</p>
<p>Tony gets called out for doing a lot of stupid stuff, but failing to call in the guy who created the helicarriers to down the helicarriers seems a bit stupid. Tony calls out Natashalie.</p>
<p>What if Clint showed a bit more loyalty to Nat and gained some common sense?</p>
<p>Wanda immediately jumps to how the Accords would impact her personally instead of the team in general always bothered me. What if it bothered someone else more?</p>
<p>What if Steve took a moment to reflect before Vision's creation in AoU?</p>
<p>What if someone else had been staying with Wanda in the compound?</p>
<p>Nat's decision to let Cap go had more repercussions for Tony than her, but what if that wasn't the case?</p>
<p>Was the Raft inhumane? Really?</p>
<p>A conversation between Rhodey and Tony after CW regarding Peter.</p>
<p>One more about adding Wanda--I'll never get over the lack of logic!</p>
<p>Natasha seems completely incapable of not doing exactly what Captain America wants even if it's completely ridiculous. What if she stuck to her guns for once.</p>
<p>So, Tony gets high-jacked in space and Rhodes completely forgets the Rogues screwed over his boy?</p>
<p>Rhodey's just done.</p>
<p>Trump may be president, but he'll really always be best known for Celebrity Apprentice. I couldn't help it.</p>
<p>Just read it.</p>
<p>Steve has enjoyed the benefits of being Captain America whether he wants to admit it or not, but when you keep saying that the safest hands are your own, there are drawbacks as well.</p>
<p>Something different happens in Siberia.</p>
<p>Of course, Tony's horrified and sad about his parents . . . but he has been doing therapy. Let it never be said that he can't see opportunity when it knocks though.</p>
<p>A number of people asked what happened after Tony left Siberia in Chapter 18--well, here you go.</p>
<p>Tony Stark wasn't recommended.</p>
<p>T'challa, vengeance is served. And boy is it cold.</p>
<p>How would everything end if things had turned out differently in Siberia.</p>
<p>Nat likes to talk about egos.</p>
<p>Steve tells Tony to take his olive branch and shove it. That would piss me off. How about you?</p>
<p>Vision is not Jarvis.</p>
<p>What is Sam took his calling a bit more seriously.</p>
<p>Ellis is a Cap fan.</p>
<p>Tony Stark: Not Recommended</p>
<p>Tony makes a different decision regarding the Time Heist</p>
<p>What if the black order didn't arrive the same day as Bruce, and when tony met Dr. Strange?</p>
<p>This is all from a single idea that I had while reading another fic about Bucky as a victim in CW, and whether or not people are automatically pro-Bucky when he is a bit of a co-dependent dick himself. While I feel for Bucky, he did aim to shoot Tony once Steve took a well-deserved hit for the lie he'd hidden. If Tony has to be sorry for reacting to his grief, then Bucky should be sorry for raising a weapon against Tony just for punching the guy that lied to him and abused his trust.</p>
<p>Bucky is innocent, but does that make him a good man?</p>
<p>Steve and Tony had a breaking point, and it wasn't Bucky. What if that changed?</p>
<p>Dumb and Dumber, Ladies and Gentleman. Steve is careless and Wakanda has great tech, but if the whole world comes a knocking, there's not much you can do.</p>
<p>Tony does a profile of his own.</p>
<p>After Bucharest, during CW.</p>
<p>Cap's got his Bucky. He shouldn't be greedy.</p>
<p>Every now and again a rich white guy deserves some empathy too.</p>
<p>Pepper was there.</p>
<p>What if Tony wasn't losing his mind from heavy metal poisoning when he met Natasha?</p>
<p>Get your licks where and when you can.</p>
<p>Seriously? No one was punished?</p>
<p>I watched Civil War with my kids again the other night, and I was struck by how absolutely dismissive Wilson was to anyone else's opinions. What kind of counselor is that?! But what would it look like if Tony got upset by that behavior? He never would have stood for someone disrespecting Jarvis. What about Vision? How might things have devolved?</p>
<p>I love Tony because at the end of the day, he's a pragmatist.</p>
<p>Watched CW with the kids this weekend and my fifteen year old son said it wasn't even believable because the Secretary of State is pretty powerless for the types of scenarios the Avengers pictured Ross masterminding.</p>
<p>Actions have consequences, but let's say that Cap convinced Tony to accept the intentions matter argument. And for all of those that think it's absurd that there is still Team Tony this long after CW, that is still a big issue. I will always think that Ultron was a turning point in the canon plot and that CW was the point of no return regarding Steve's character arc--I really think he became a much more flawed, selfish character at that point than people want to accept, and I don't believe that he was ever really redeemed for the choices he made in those films. Fighting Thanos was more like what Wanda did in Ultron--the only choice he could ever make at that point. He may have worked with Tony to fight Thanos, but no one will ever know if his desperation to continue on was more about Bucky and his individual friendships (Maybe Steve's goal since Bucky and most of his people got snapped) or saving everyone else (Tony's goal since he sacrificed what he had finally obtained to get them all back).</p>","<p>So, I had another work that didn't tag properly, but was still a short collection of one-shots (listed in Avengers and not Team Iron Man). I decided to just add those chapters here and delete the other work. Some of you might have already read this and the next couple of one-shots from that previous work. Sorry for the confusion.</p>
<p>This is a one-shot from another collection that I'm deleting. Sorry if you end up re-reading one you've already read.</p>
<p>This is another chapter taken from the one-shot repercussions that I'm deleting. Sorry if you've read it off that fic.</p>
<p>This is the last chapter taken from that other work. Sorry for any re-reads or confusion.</p>
<p>"" ""=speech<br>' '=thoughts</p>
<p>Bucky comes off kind of bad in this one too. I'm basing this off of a lot of tropes from Returning Rogues Fanfiction--so, this is like Infinity Wars and EndGame didn't happen. Not canon (None of this is really canon since these are ""what-if"" scenarios, but whatever).</p>
<p>This is dedicated to Xythia. Don't let the haters get you down. It's better to laugh.</p>
<p>Most people blame Tony--and he even says ""my fault"" in CW--but he has serious control issues, and that doesn't account for a whole series of other events (some of which he may not know about. Did Wanda ever admit to playing with his mind? Why would she?). Still, even if Tony's to blame, you can't tell me that there were no repercussions.</p>"

<p>you know, i wanted to give Jaskier an edge in this so that's why he's a little ooc at times. Imagine giving almost your all to some lumbering idiot only for him to ditch you like that?

<p>Okay SO<br>-Geralt is a dumbass but he's trying. I loved breaking the fourth wall with him a little so excuse me being a literature nerd. I also needed to make sure that he knows what he did wrong and that it was clear from the start that he's been an asshole.<br>- Triss is PURE and must be PROTECTED and i love her a lot okay Triss baby you dont need Geralt i'll marry you<br>- i went in on that monster bit a little bc i do love that whole aspect of the series but i just cant fit an entire monster hunting mystery into this without it seeming like it's unnecessary and the Gryttie is a nordic cryptid or something that i'd looked up when i needed an acquatic based monster for the scene<br>-it took me far longer than id like to admit to settle on a proper timeline for this fic and ill probably make a graphic for it eventually if anyone wants to see it (once the fic is over of course) AND i mostly completely disregard the shows actual timeline bc my mans (jaskier) doesnt look a day over 25.<br>- What is Yen up to? Well, she's being the best wingwoman she can possibly be and maybe she exaggerates a little sometimes but - well, anything for a happy ending right?<br>- What is Yen up to? pt. two - it's not as important but stay tuned anyway!<br><a href=""https://marionettefthjm.tumblr.com/post/190342683260/its-geralt-but-hes-got-braids-nowrel="" rel=""nofollow"">geralt with some braids that i drew</a></p>

I want to address the Yen/Triss situation:<br>- in game, as far as i know, they were both super into Geralt and i simply, did not give a fuck and cut out the middle man (geralt) and now they're engage to be married and on the run bc Yen probably did some dumb shit and got them into trouble<br>Second of all: Jaskier and Geralt lived happily ever after and Geralt found Jaskier in every life that they lived ever because they're SOULMATES okay.<br>Thirdly: i didnt go into the grovelling as much as i wanted to because i wanted it to be going on over a period of several days so if he'd done it all at once it would have been more detailed but not as impactful as imagining geralt hanging out and gardening for two weeks<br>And lastly, i want to thank everyone for loving this story and supporting my dumb ideas and headcanons and i hope yall are satisfied with the ending!</p>

<p>(Wherein a time-traveling Wangxian have absolutely no self-control, and everyone else is just slowly losing their minds).</p>","<p>Here's another fic in this series! It would be best to read ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" and ""The Mess We've Left Behind"" first, but if any of you want to jump straight into this one - basically, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian have time traveled back to their younger bodies, and this all happened midway through the events at the Guanyin Temple, pre-confession scene. They ended up in the middle of class on their first day, and ended up going to hell with it, and confessing in front of everyone. And then they ran off and eloped, and everyone was very, very confused, since as far as they knew, LWJ and WWX didn't even know each other.</p>
<p>This fic will take place in multiple scenes spanning different amounts of time after the events of these previous two fics. There will be five smaller stories in total that make up this fic.</p>
<p>A-Yuan will be showing up in this, in the last of these fics, which will be in the next chapter I post! </p>
<p>Hope you guys enjoy this :D</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_1_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So, I finally decided to write another fic for this series! And it literally all spanned from one comment on another one of my fics from Dandelion_sama that said: ""There's this a simple , practical method to drive people ending their seclusion quickly, that even the infamous live only for seclusion, qingheng jun, would fall for it and end his seclusion, and reunite with his family....""</p>
<p> and that made me really want to write a fic where this happens, and then I thought about this series, and somehow ended up coming up with a bunch of other ideas...and then this happened.</p>
<p> So this is basically happening in multiple little drabbles (well they were meant to be little, and some might be smaller than others but...yeah they really didn't end up being that small haha. So maybe mini-oneshots?) that take place in the Wangxian time travel universe. I've basically written the whole thing already so chapter 2 will come out sometime this week.</p>
<p> Chapter 2 will include 3 mini stories: ""Jin Zixuan Learns Something New"" ""The Death of Wen Ruohan"" and ""Meet Our New Child!"" (this last one will have A-Yuan showing up! So look forward to that haha)</p>
<p> Hope you guys enjoy this! The response to my other two stories in this series has been unbelievable, so thank you to all of you guys for that :D</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So the end is here (so far anyway). Who knows though, I might end up writing more for this in the future...and if I do, I'll most likely just end up adding onto this fic.</p>
<p>That being said, if you guys have any ideas/requests you would like me to write for this, feel free to mention them in the comments! Can't promise I'll get to them straight away, or if I'd be able to add them to this series, but I'll see what I can do!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Just a short chapter based on a bunch of comments left on the previous chapter - quite a few of you mentioned how funny it would be if Jingyi somehow ended up as the heir, and that gave me inspiration to write this. Hopefully you guys enjoy it, and feel free to give me suggestions/ideas for potential future chapters! </p>
<p>(Also, why do I just seem to love torturing LQR in my fics? xD) </p>
<p>Also, I have no idea if Jingyi is his birth name or courtesy name, and I'm assuming courtesy name, but I absolutely suck at coming up with original names, so I'm just sticking with Jingyi here haha</p>
<p>Hope you guys enjoyed this! :)</p>"

<p>It’s nothing for them to worry about, of course.</p>
<p>(Or, where time travel occurs, and Wei Wuxian ends up being a guest at his own wedding).</p>","<p>So, before you start reading, just a quick (and quite important) note — the future they travel to his an AU - Canon Divergence version of the canon universe. Basically sometime after Jin Ling’s birth, WWX actually gets his act together, and LWJ actually manages to communicate properly, and the confess and decide to get married. And now the Wens are all living at the Cloud Recesses, and Wangxian get to have an amazing wedding with all their family around, because that is what they deserve.</p>
<p>And THAT is the future where these three will end up in. I nearly wrote this happening post-canon, but then felt sad because most people were dead, and then I realised that it’d just complicate things because WWX would be in MXY’s body. So I just decided to do it this way.</p>
<p>Also, it just occurred to me, but you guys could probably pretend this is a continuation of my fic “A Broken Heart Fixes Everything” if any of you have read that. Because this would totally work in that universe.</p>

<p>honestly don't like this chapter that much because there's no smut in it, just a lot of talking ;o; but i wanted to add the team...and do sort of an in-between chapter before they start to work up to more smut..<br>they'll show up more but i felt it was long overdue...a little plot development i guess..not that there is really much of a plot (一。一;;）</p>

<p>this was originally a one-shot but as i was writing it i realized it was going to be too long!! and i wanted to divide it into multiple chapters with kageyama and hinata amping up their competition to the very end. i'm usually not very motivated to finish things which is why i usually write one-shots, but if people enjoy this i will do my best ｡(*^▽^*)ゞ i'd like to include hinata and kageyama being ridiculously possessive of each other in the future...anyway thank you for reading! i probably will include some daisuga</p>"

<p>Ok this is the same premise as my other fic ""between speech and silence"", because I was originally going to go a different route plotwise w that one, but realized it would only work in a way longer fic. So, here is the way longer fic! </p>

</p>
<p>if y'all dont already project your childhood trauma onto characters and write it into fanfiction, I highly recommend it for therapeutic purposes. I see a lot of comments relating to Jaskier in this fic, and I'm telling you right now that writing about it really makes you feel therepeutized</p>

<p>Some comments asked abt a Geralt POV, I may or may not do a second piece to this w his POV, I actually intended to from the start and wrote a few chapters of it before this became such a long fic, so it depends how motivated I am to work on it when this ones done!</p>

<p>Falls to the floor in exhaustion, crawls to the shore. *my watch has ended*</p>
<p>Oh my God, that fic took a thousand years to write. It got to the point where I was literally yelling, “WHY WONT YOU FUCKING END! END! END! END!”</p>
<p>Okay, so this fic has been 75% written since, like, before the hiatus—I just couldn’t handle the grocery store scene and couldn’t believe no one talked about it? HOW? So y’all got some indulgent angst fic as a result. I had to slow burn as much as I could because I’m a masochist. I live for the Buddie slowburn. </p>
<p>I hope you guys like this fic! I’m always iffy about OCs so I’m really iffy about Cole but I needed someone who didn’t know anyone else in 118, and who was just Buck’s. The backstory dump was...well I thought it was important so I kept it in bc it was short anyway even though I hate backstory dumps and it fucks with my pacing. If things feel a little out of character, it may be because I pulled a few things out of an original story of mine that's been sitting on my desktop for YEARS though I only used the material because of how closely Buddie reflected my characters (isn't it funny? Most people adapt their fanfics for their original works, and I do the opposite hehe oh well at least this way it's not gathering virtual dust).</p>
<p>Also—how nice of the show runners to confirm Eddie is a bad cook for me. Now if they could confirm literally the rest of my story, that’d be s’well. </p>
<p>I have another fic idea for these guys (or several), but I have a ton of Tarlos ideas too for 911 Lone Star and I need to get at least one of those ones done AND finish my Little Women fic first. </p>
<p>If any of you are Tarlos fans, here’s a snippet of what is *likely* to be my next fic:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <i>“The thing is--the thing is, Carlos had always felt temporary. TK had wanted someone, and Carlos had been there, but his presence--his specific presence, and not just a male body to pass a few hours with--was, ultimately, negotiable. Convenient, yes; acceptable, yes; but never, ever critical. So he’d known that his time was limited. Known it the first time TK had walked out of his apartment without a backwards glance. Heard the ticking of the countdown the moment TK had said, “my ex just texted me,” then louder again when he said, “my ex is in town.” He’s not sure why it hurt so much to hear “I’m getting back with my ex” now, except that it does.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> <i>He’d hoped. He’d known better, and he’d hoped.”</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know, I know. Don’t come at me. I live for angst. All the angst. (In this scenario, they were strictly fwb/casual).</p>
<p>As a final note--I still can't figure out how AO3 and HTML works. I apologize for the thousand of relationship tags because I couldn't originally find the Buck/Eddie one when I went to post this story. </p>
<p>If anyone sees anything triggering that they would like tagged, please let me know and I will update the tags.</p>
<p>Title is from the e.e.cummings poem, although it was also very much inspired by the other e.e.cummings poem, ""you are tired (i think)"". I'll be honest though, that poem has inspired a lot of fics for me. Angstangstangst.</p>"

<p>This is NOT the last chapter of this, just so you guys know.

One more chapter and an epilogue for the main fic, though I have a ton of ideas in this timeline, so there will definitely be shorter pieces with all the witchers coming out in the next few weeks.

Thank you guys so much for sticking with me during this whole process, and for all the love you guys have sent my way. It truly means the world to me. That said- there will be more! I've been inspired by your comments/prompts to make this a timeline with multiple stories. </p>
<p>The first one, which will be a multi-chapter fic (though not as long as this one), is going to be hurt/comfort about Jaskier getting kidnapped and all the hell his witchers rain down on the man fool enough to hurt him. The first chapter of that will be out this weekend, so stay tuned! I've made this fic a series, so you can bookmark the series if you want updates when I write something new. Also, if I use your prompt, I promise to dedicate the fic to you/mention you in the author's notes. </p>
<p>That's it! Thanks again for reading, and please feel free to leave thoughts/questions/prompts for the timeline (or prompts unrelated to this fic) in the comments. Love you guys!!</p>"

<p>It was just his luck that his first migraine in literally years would hit when he was visiting his father in Atlantis for the first time after the war with Gaea.

<p>I called Percy small quite a few times in this. I’m going with while he’d average/a bit above average for a person (I read 5'11 years ago and that’s what I’m sticking with) and that’s not tall for a merperson. He’s short and pretty skinny to them, and 17 here so still a kid, especially considering most of them are centuries old or more. I'm in my 20's and still want someone to look after me when I'm sick, so I don't see it as too out of character for Percy to be the same way, especially when it's his father looking after him. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
<p>---- note, I know I need to edit some things for consistency with the rest of the series, as I wrote this and a couple of others when I was super sick. I know there are some continuity issues but haven't had the time (or desire, tbh) to go edit and find them all.</p>"

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I know it's been a while since I have posted in this fic but I recieved a prompt for my We Forgot Peter Series that fell nicely into this universe I created. This prompt was from Taekwonono on Ao3 - I was wondering if you can make a oneshot about the battle itself and that since everyone forgot and no one was really paying attention to Peter, he ends up snapping before anyone does, before Tony even gets anywhere near Thanos. This will cause everything from thanos's army to disappear allowing everyone to congratulate each other until Tony notices that he can't find Peter and ends up finding him leaning against the rocks with the gantlet (idk how to spell it) in his hands.</p>
<p>I'm not currently taking prompts for either story/series but I will say that there will be probably more added to this in the future :)</p>
<p>I hope you all enjoy and apologies for any mistakes.</p>

<p>I have also posted this chapter in the We Forgot Peter Series :)</p>
<p>I hope you will all enjoy and apologies for any mistakes!</p>
<p>Hey guys!!!!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all the love you have given this story :D I'm so glad so many of you are enjoying it!</p>
<p>I'm adding another chapter thanks to Sirennette on ao3 who prompted for my We Forgot Peter Series: i have and idea for a promt that could follow the “one in a million” series as well as the “we forgot Peter” one. Peter is finally okay and can go back to school, he is exited because he missed being Mj and Ned and now he can finally be with them again. But there’s one tiny little detail they forgot, Gym Class, more exactly the change room. Even if Peter is fine there is still some scars that didn’t fully heal. What will happen if his class saw those scars?</p>
<p>I hope you all enjoy and apologies for any mistakes.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for everyone who voted for this fic in the Iron dad-creator Awards! I can't thank you enough for all the love and support you have given me and this story!

<p>""I, myself, am only just around twenty! I think, anyway."" - as far as I know, WWX is around 24 when he dies, and WWX doesn't know the exact age of MXY when he dies, only that he's older than Mo Ziyuan. Given that he's shorter than WWX's original body and is also likely malnourished/smaller, 20 is just a guesstimate on WWX's part</p>
<p>You may have noticed that this has switched from 3 chapters to 4 - that is because it turns out I am exceptionally bad at guesstimating how many words it takes to write a certain number of scenes, so I've split the last chapter into two for length.</p>

<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)</p>
<p>Hope you guys enjoyed this little piece of insanity my brain decided to spit out.</p>
<p>So I spent the majority of today trying to get what is probably the worst assignment I have done in my life finished, and I’ve gotten through maybe half of it. I desperately needed a break, and writing usually calms me down, and I somehow ended up coming up with this idea.</p>
<p>…I usually come up with the most random fic ideas, but I think this might be the weirdest one I’ve thought up so far.</p>
<p>So, I don’t know if I explained this whole ‘cursed scroll’ idea well enough, so — basically, it’s a blank scroll where if you write something on it, e.g. “[insert name] needs to…” they need to do fulfil whatever the action is, or they cease to exist. The scroll will usually take about a day after the instructions have been written on it to work, and when it does a curse mark will appear on the arm of the person who has been cursed, and the same mark will appear on the scroll above whatever has been written. The mark will grow darker as the hours past, and gets closer to the moment when time will run out, and will only disappear after the action has been carries out.</p>
<p>…Basically I just made up the dumbest idea I could think of to let me create this monstrosity xD </p>
<p>Hopefully you guys still enjoy it though xD Let me know what you think!</p>"

<p>this'll update on Sundays i think (it has been Sunday for 17 minutes but oh well that counts) (this depends on when i finish the rest of it and also how much restraint i have but every Sunday is the longest it should take so)</p>
<p>okay so i just really wanted to watch someone watch zukos agni kai so i did that</p>
<p>(a lot of details about zukos childhood came from TunaFishChris's fic btw, as you may have already noticed but still i gotta credit properly right?)</p>

<p>i have a Tumblr if y'all care. I've not got anything about this series there, but if you wanna drop me an ask about it or whatever... https://www.tumblr.com/blog/foiblepnoteworthy</p>

<p>oh yeah and I'm pretty sure that you're not meant to do what katara did if someone's having a panic attack (like yeah untying him is a good move but she should probably have stayed out of his space). I just took authorial liberties and also they're soulmates and identify each other by touch so...</p>
<p>I have strict enough plans for the next 2 chapters that they should be all i need and i wont have to add any more but who even knows anymore. maybe I'll end up squishing the two chapters into one, idk what im doing anymore</p>

<p>kudos comment subscribe we have one chapter left yo guys just ONE MORE CHAPTER AND THEN I'M FREE WHY DID I DO THIS<br>(hello my regulars i see you and i love you and i cherish you and i will answer comments this time i swear I'm getting better at it)</p>
<p>next chapter will be Sunday or sooner depending on when it is written (but latest is Sunday don't worry)</p>
<p>In other news i went back to updating the guilt series every two weeks instead of weekly and this thing is almost finished which means I'll finally get back to the non-evil twin woot woot (the first series mentioned is soft emotions, trauma, and theatre and the second is the dumbest funking comedy istg you'll like it i promise) because otherwise I'll run out of new content and therefore validation from comments</p>
<p>Tumblr, where i really need to do some sort of art for this (what should i do please tell me i cant think of anything): https://foiblepnoteworthy.tumblr.com/</p>
<p>*inhales* *screams internally*<br>Two reasons to be screaming today. The first one you've probably already noticed. There is still another chapter to go. I am losing all faith in everything. I swear this is an accident.<br>The second scream is actually a good one: This fic got recced by aloneintherain/captainkirkk and so I am going to die. Let me know if you came here from that I'm just hella curious.</p>

<p>kudos comment subscribe because its still not done and I'm going to murder something<br>(I'm going to murder Zuko i feel like this is his fault somehow)</p>
<p>(Hello my regulars I'm sorry about all this How are you doing today You've been here a while would you like any refreshments?)</p>
<p>IMPORTANT QUESTION: what should I work on when this is finished? I have a few nice ideas for (hopeful) one-shot fics, but i also need to finish a wolf in wolf and the non-evil twin series in general. I've been thinking about going back to the turtleduck fic also, maybe making a little season one shaped arc and finding some way to call it finished. Or should i be looking at guilt and making sure I've got enough pre-written chapters to avoid a haitus?</p>
<p>tldr what do you want me to work on after I finish this fic, which will update on sunday/every Sunday (i want there to be one chapter but i am not a complete idiot so)<br>(Yes that is also me plugging my other works; almost everything I write is avatar so there's stuff you'll like there, i promise. it ranges from comedy to found family to romance and Zuko is always the main character)</p>
<p>Here is my Tumblr it's just doodles of my fics and occasional updates on my works. Come yell at me there: https://foiblepnoteworthy.tumblr.com/</p>

<p>(hello my charming regulars, you beautiful sunfish, you majestic musk-oxen, you gorgeous...)</p>
<p>Okay so like i was editing this and i went 'yo i kinda wanna see some dadkoda stuff in this' so *sigh* i might write a lil follow up sometime. Like in a few months or something. i really need to get back to the non-evil twin (which i hope to have an update for within two weeks :) it will be more fucking with jet but that's what y'all want anyway so...)</p>
<p>seriously tho its been so cool to have so many readers on this; this is my most popular fic at time of writing and the response i got was actually insane. I love you guys and i want you to stick around and i swear i mostly just do avatar so...</p>

<p>The commission, displeased with his reliance on them, had taken his flight feathers, cut off the tips, and grounded him both literally and figuratively. He can’t fly like he’s meant to, like he always has. Instead, his wings are two useless, feathery lumps on his back, weighing him down as he blankly waits for a car to take him home for the first time since he’d moved into his own place.

<p>I was debating whether to refer to them as WCZ and CSSR in this, or as LSZ and LJY, but I decided to stick with the former since I figured, if they had the full range of meories from their previous life, they’d probably identify with that more.</p>
<p> CSSR will be in the next chapter!</p>
<p> This is a bit of a weird idea, I know, and it was initially supposed to be really crack-y, but this actually ended up being angstier than I thought it’d be haha. I guess there’s no way to have complete humour when the main character is continuously mourning his wife throughout this. But CSSR and WCZ will be reunited in the next chapter!</p>

When I shoved the first draft of this at her in December, it was 16k and she came back to me saying, ""Listen, this is fine, but I think you forgot your point about halfway through,"" and I legitimately went, ""I had a point?"" And then I had to convince her I wasn't joking. And then she had to explain to me what the point of my own fic was. This has gone through more edits and rewrites than anything else I've done, and if you received any emotional catharsis from it at all... From the bottom of my heart, she's why.</p>

<p>hi kids!</p>
<p>the response to this fic has been absolutely shocking and all i can say is thank you from the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p>starting to get into the nitty gritty character stuff, and i think kirishima is really emotionally intelligent, because he himself put in the work pretty early on, what with the whole middle school development we had with him. best boy! bakugo is such a piece of fucking work lmao but we'll ge more into that in further chapters and WHY HE IS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p>this is shaping up to be abouuuuut 8 chapters acc. to my outline, but it really depends on if i decide we need more talking about our feelings or not lmao.</p>

<p>long time no see! i've been having Bad Brain recently, only able to focus on IRL stuff so i can like. survive. though i woke up today and felt much much better so hopefully that's over for now. </p>
<p>there's a couple of fun little references in this chapter i hope you enjoy, and the elbow thing is real- though not QUITE as cool as i'm imagining, tbh. but that's the nature of cool mecha anime stuff vs. real life progress, right? <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5660967/"" rel=""nofollow"">it's from this NIH article which i enjoyed reading.</a></p>

<p>ETA: Since posting this story, I learned that A-Yi is a homonym for auntie and while I feel like that could be a very funny way for Jin Ling to get back at Jingyi for calling him ""young mistress,"" it doesn't really work for a tiny child, so after consulting w/a couple of Chinese speakers, I settled on calling him Jing-er.</p>

I got introduced to it recently and fell in love, and wrote this!</p>
<p>Just a cw: a character asks another (underage) character if they've been sexually assaulted.

<p> </p>
<p>an eta: this fic has been on my mind very recently again and you know what? it <i>is</i> dark. when i wrote this, i convinced myself that it wasn't, because like most fics, this sort of thing is just written out of pure catharsis and coping mechanisms. if i were to write this fic today, i'd probably do it a lot differently, probably mostly on bakugou's characterisations, but i wrote this the way i wrote it, and i am still proud of what it is, and the comments i still get that just thank me for writing it.</p>
<p>it gets better. it really, really does. me saying <i>this isn't actually that dark</i> and <i>it's a lil dark</i> is tucking these things under a rug, but, and i think most people <i>did</i> get the subconscious message i was telling when i wrote this, the point of this fic is healing. acceptance. moving on.</p>
<p>this fic is coping. and this fic is hope.</p>

Y'all wanted to see more about the people of Lettenhove and Jaskier's witchers, and my brain was hit by a stroke of inspiration so strong it shocked me. I have this whole thing planned out already. Oh boy, it is gonna be a long one. I hope you guys are ready, I hope you enjoy, and, to all those people who left kind words on ""Pulling Rank,"" thank you! A special thanks to RoS13, whose plot bunnies always make me smile like crazy (except for the angsty ones), and whose comment was a huge part of the inspiration for this story. </p>
<p>By the way, there isn't really a need to read the rest of the series before this one. A few mentions and such might not make sense, but the narrative here will stand by itself just fine.</p>

<p>Next chapter, we get to see a non-wolf witcher at Lettenhove! And more from my main hoe, Destiny herself. </p>
<p>As always, comments/rants/thoughts are super appreciated!</p>
<p>Thank you all for your patience on this chapter. I pride myself on uploading regularly, but I got two new piercings and sleep has been...elusive. Who knew I rolled over so often? But I am rested now and re-hyped about this story, so I hope you all enjoy!</p>

<p>I didn't want to put this at the beginning because I wanted Letho to be a surprise, but y'all, FUCK CANON. Letho and Geralt have all this cool backstory, but so much of it is tied to Geralt's relationship with Yennefer that it does not fit into this 'verse at all. Suffice to say that Letho is still a Kingslayer, and he and Geralt still fought, but I'm not going into too much more detail than that because the events of this fic literally cannot happen if canon is obeyed. </p>
<p>Anyway, timelines are hard. I hope you guys liked this chapter, and, as always, please leave thoughts/questions/rants in the comments. It's so much fun for me to interact with you, and people always offer the best plot bunnies/headcanons that an author could ask for!</p>

<p>I have zero goddamn reason for why this is two months late. Blame the plague, guys. </p>
<p>But the good news is, I have my mojo back and am super excited to continue this story! Thanks to everyone who is following this- your interest in it and all the super sweet comments were a brilliant motivation for kicking myself out of my funk. I hope this chapter lives up to your expectations!</p>

<p>School is starting up, so I finally feel like a person again! It's nice to be able to wake up early and actually have something to do. But of course, what do I do when my professors load on the work? You guessed it! I write Witcher fanfiction. Please enjoy my product of procrastination.</p>

<p>I'm back! Everything has been crazy lately because I just moved to Canada, and getting all my ID, cell service, and wifi was a mess. But I'm in a really good place now, in an apartment I love, so I can finally get back to writing. That said, this should be getting updated regularly until it's finished. </p>
<p>Also, I want to give a huge shoutout to RoS13. They wrote two completely hilarious poems for me in the comments that were a huge source of motivation for jumping back into this project. If anyone wants to read those poems, they're just in the comments, so you can go look at them if you choose. Thank you RoS!</p>

<p>A short little chapter as I get ready to wrap things up. The next chapter of this fic will be the last, and it will be out before the end of the month! </p>
<p>Also: If I Must Starve hit 5000 kudos, and I just have to say a massive, crazy huge THANK YOU to all of you for reading, commenting, and leaving kudos on my work. My writing has gotten an insane amount of attention and kindness from the community. It means so, so much to me. You folks are amazing, and I appreciate you every day!</p>

<p>I saw a lot of super sweet comments talking about cuddle piles and such. As much as I love the thought, I just couldn't do it. These characters have too much bloody history, and too many self-preservation instincts, to end up sleeping comfortably next to each other. Letho and the wolves can be cordial, sure, but anything approaching intimacy felt way too unrealistic for me to write. Hope you guys still enjoyed! </p>
<p>As always, please feel free to leave rants/opinions/thoughts in the comments!</p>
<p>Canon? Who's she? I've never heard of her. </p>
<p>Also, I'm posting this a few hours before midnight in my time zone. So happy new year to all of you! Good fucking riddance to 2020. It was a nightmare, but we got through it, and I'm hopeful for a better 2021.</p>

<p>That's the end, folks! I probably won't write anything else for this 'verse, or the fandom at all really, until season 2 comes out. But I hope you guys enjoyed this wild ride, and thanks a ton for sticking around. I know I didn't keep to a decent upload schedule with this one, so I appreciate all the continued support. As always, feel free to leave thoughts/questions/rants in the comments, and if you guys ever want to chat, I'm @igneum_art on IG. Happy 2021!</p>"

<p>The naming squad and I had some puzzled conversations re: how to handle the courtesy names, because technically, in historical China, a courtesy name isn't given to you until you reach adulthood (age 20), except that in MDZS, everyone arrives at the Cloud Recesses fifteen years old and already in possession of courtesy names, <i>and</i> in the show, JFM and Yanli call Wei Wuxian by his courtesy name (and ""A-Xian""!) when he's first brought back to Lotus Pier as a tiny child, <i>and</i> Yanli asks Wei Wuxian to think of a courtesy name for Jin Ling before he's even born, so... MXTX, what is the truth??? I've decided to err on the side of following her slightly-tweaked-from-perfectly-historical-accuracy worldbuilding. She tweaked it for the sake of writing Cute Family Moments and... *gestures to this whole fic* here we are.</p>

<p>(And yes, a couple weeks later the whole family goes to Yunmeng for a month, and all the kids learn to swim in the river, and they eat lotus seeds and spicy food, and A-Chun falls absolutely in love with it and draws Jiang Cheng a picture of the river that he absolutely hangs on the Metaphorical Fantasy Refrigerator, and Ding-er catches a dozen frogs and declares that it's the best place ever, and Wei Wuxian tells Jiang Cheng that Her Ladyship hasn't been colicky once since he visited them and that she's sleeping through the night sometimes which is great because that means he and Lan Zhan have a lot more energy for-- but Jiang Cheng puts him in a headlock before he can finish talking.</p>
<p>...And a couple years later, A-Chun comes to be a Jiang disciple, and A-Hao splits his time evenly between Gusu and Yunmeng so he doesn't have to be apart from his twin too much, and a few years after *that* Ding-er comes to Yunmeng too. She doesn't become a cultivator. She just wants to be a naturalist and study aquatic plants and wildlife.)</p>"

<p>it physically hurt me to write such bad grammar :,(<br>also i genuinely don't like this chapter (which sucks because i've been planning to do this for a while, but it felt kind of unnatural, especially with the fact that i made it sound like clay already knows he has a super huge crush on george but like idk man)<br>if you guys don't like it, i'll delete it or rewrite it or have them talk about something else :)</p>
<p>oops my finger slipped</p>
<p>so since a few people asked/guessed wrong as to what the deleted message said, i will explain!<br>basically in the text, george was admitting that knowing that clay was giving his attention to sapnap rather than himself made him pretty jealous<br>if he had kept that and continued texting afterwards without realizing how weird that sounded, he would have most likely ended up letting it slip that he's kind of totally head over heels for clay<br>it could've been a confession chapter<br>but it wasn't 🙃</p>

</p>
<p>was about time for me to post the epilogue, yeah?<br>everyone's probably lost interest at this point, but i finally got it the way i wanted (and yet i'm still super unsure about it ughhh)<br>now that i've done this, i can officially say this is the first multi-chapter fic that i've finished</p>
<p>it was really fun (whenever i actually worked on it haha), and it made me super happy to read all your comments and see that while i enjoyed making it, you enjoyed reading :)</p>
<p>i hope the epilogue was worth the wait, and it feels so free to finally be <i>finished</i> (even though it's technically been finished...i don't know if the epilogue counts)<br>that being said, have a great day, and thank you for reading [message redacted]!!</p>"

<p> <strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I love war prize fics...</p>
<p>Any canon/setting/or other genre included is fine. Any background pairings are fine.</p>
<p>Wei Ying was not adopted by the Jiang Clan as a child; he grew up the yiling patriarch instead (reasoning is your choice). When the war happens, the 4 Clans ask him to help defeat the Wens. Maybe Lan Zahn goes to the Burial Mounds to request help, or Wei Ying sees Lan Zahn at a war meeting and says ""him! I choose that one."" But Wei Ying gives a small gift (token/ribbon/something of your choice) to Lan Zahn that he <i>must</i> wear until the end of the war, promising that it will help against the Wen puppets.</p>
<p>*On the condition* that Lan Zahn joins him of his free will in the Burial Mounds after the war is won. That can be forever, or can be for a specific length of time.</p>
<p>Whatever the gift is, when they approach Nightless City, the puppets run in terror from Lan Zahn. It turns the tide of the war.</p>
<p>Lan Zahn goes to him following the war. Do the other clans let them be? Do they now fear the yiling patriarch? Do they find a reason to attack the burial mounds under the flimsy excuse they must rescue Lan Zahn? </p>
<p>Dub-con is fine, no non-con please. Would prefer that Lan Zahn falls in love with Wei YIng as well, and at some point, protects/defends him against the other 4 Clans. (Maybe they meet up a year after the war, Lan Zahn and Wei YIng going to some conference to meet with them. Maybe it's if/when they try to attack the Burial Mounds.) </p>
<p>I would like LXC to get some peace over their union, in the end, so he doesn't worry endlessly for his brother.</p>"

<p>It’s not his fault, it’s really not. It’s just that sometimes he’s sitting in the kitchens (the best place to get the gossip) drinking tea and trying to relax for once, and some of the kitchen staff will start gossiping where he can still hear them. He doesn’t really try to listen in; it’s not his place and he won’t judge the staff based on whatever rumors are running around, but Spirits is it interesting. He tries not to listen too much, or get too invested in it though. Gossip is gossip after all, and rumors hardly ever turn out to be true. </p>
<p>But Zuko absolutely needs to know if Maya from the laundry room broke up with her piece of shit boyfriend. </p>
<p>Or, 5 times Zuko got invested in/meddled in palace gossip, and 1 time he was the subject of the gossip.</p>","<p>I mentioned briefly in another fic that Zuko likes to sit in the kitchen and gossip with the staff, and so this fic was born. Could also be summarized as 'Zuko embracing his theater kid side and loving Mess.' Not beta read, so any mistakes are my own. Enjoy!</p>

It really means the world to me, thank you all so much. I hope this continues to be a fic that people read and enjoy. Thank you all so much &lt;3</p>

Arthur/Gwen and Merlin/Gwaine</p>
<p>Hey everyone! Thank you so much for the love. :) I'm gonna update every couple days now I've just been really busy watching hockey because playoffs started. I've also decided on a Lancelot/Merlin pairing for my next fic now I think because I believe the fandom is sorely lacking in that area on this site. Hope you love this chapter! :)</p>
<p>Hey everyone! Another short chapter, sorry, but the next ones are the long ones. :) I couldn't remember if Lancelot ever mentioned what happened to his family in the show, so I came up with this extremely sad story. If he did mention his family and I forgot it, well then I suppose we're just having a lil OOC backstory.</p>
<p>Only 2 more left! The response to this has been absolutely insane so thank you everyone!</p>
<p>One left!</p>
<p>And this story is done! I really hope you all like the ending! I don't love the reveal but I didn't want to get into a long-winded reveal scene so this is what I came up with.</p>"

This is another vent fic that I use to deal with my own sexual assault story, which leads to my next point.<br>TRIGGER WARNING! This fic discusses sexual assault of a child, with some graphic flashbacks later on and multiple discussions of what happened throughout the fic. If this triggers you in any way then do NOT read this fic. You have been warned.<br>Not beta'd, obviously. </p>
<p> The title of this fic is inspired by one of my favorite <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/53jogSv23P6DFcOHcZrDs9"" rel=""nofollow"">SONGS</a> by Avenge Sevenfold, I highly suggest checking it out if you want to get emotional.</p>

<p>Hello! I'm here again with another chapter. This chapter discusses the act of sexual assault, but it isn't graphic. Still, it may be triggering to some, so don't read this story if that upsets you. <br> Not beta'd, of course.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)

<p>I hope you all liked it! Leave me a comment if you want to see more, it really motivates me! &lt;3</p>
<p>Hello fellow fanfiction fiends. (See what I did there? Alliteration? No? Okay.) There is a TRIGGER WARNING for this chapter. It depicts graphicly violent descriptions of the aftermath of rape, some of which I've experienced myself and know to be real. if those things trigger you, then this chapter and this entire story are not for you. <br> Not beta'd, as per usual.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Whoo! That was emotional, huh? It was also kind of all over the place, but you know how it goes. Next chapter we'll be seeing how Mitsuki, Masaru and Inko react to the news of what happened to their sons, so I hope y'all are prepared for that.</p>
<p>We're nearing the home stretch, folks! I'm trying to decide if I want to add another chapter or two, so I guess y'all should look out for that. <br> TRIGGER WARNING, this chapter discusses child abuse and rape, so if you aren't comfortable with that, then you probably shouldn't be reading this story. <br> Not beta'd, as per usual.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>What did y'all think? Some of you already guessed that Inko already knew about what was happening to Izuku, but I just wanted to clarify that she did NOT take Izuku to the hospital after Hisashi raped him. She just found the blood on his clothes and figured that was what happened, and since Izuku never told her that he was even injured, he figured that his mother had no idea any of it happened in the first place. <br> Next chapter will start with some healing, so let's all pray for our boys to find peace. Lord knows I'll never give them any if my stories have anything to say about it.</p>
<p>Whew! This is the last chapter folks! I'm currently debating on whether I should make this a series, so if you'd like to see that, comment down below on what you'd like to see happen in this universe! <br> Not beta'd, as per usual. This chapter also reveals spoilers from plots that happen in the manga right after the anime ends, so if you are an anime-only person, don't read it!</p>
<p>How did y'all like it? Would you like to see more? Let me know!</p>"

<p>While you don't have to have read that fic in order to enjoy this one, I highly recommend reading it anyway! Firstly, reading that fic will aid in your understanding of this one, and secondly, it’s just a great piece!!</p>
<p>This was not originally intended to be a whole rewrite, but that is... exactly what it turned into?? Anyway, the key difference between this fic and the orig is that; instead of only Izuku being involved in a time loop, Aizawa is as well! This fic is about the both of them trying to find a way to save the other, while refusing to communicate the full extent of what they’re really going through. (spoiler alert: that doesn’t work.)</p>
<p>Also if you’ve read aloneintherain’s fic, you’ll see that I completely disregarded Shinsou’s involvement in the story. I swear I don't hate him, I just really wanted to focus on Aizawa and Midoriya's relationship! Also there was literally no way that I could add yet ANOTHER overlapping time loop without the story being completely incomprehensible.</p>

<p>In which Izuku possesses the words and knowledge to try and correct his classmate's misguided beliefs concerning Quirkless people, but actually communicating them is another challenge altogether.</p>","<p>Hi everyone, this is my first fic in the bnha fandom and I'm actually super excited about it. It's been a long time since I've watched the show, but recently I've been reading a lot of fics for it and it's reignited a lot of the love I have for it. Something that's always bothered me though (and some other fans apparently) is how Quirklessness/Quirkless discrimination is not something that's really addressed past the introductory episodes. With Izuku especially, I think there's an interesting struggle there as someone who was born Quirkless and only now has a Quirk. As such, I've decided to explore it here.</p>
<p>Content warnings for this fic include: References to bullying, suicide of an OC off screen, past suicidal ideation of a major character, and overall just ignorant/unintentionally hurtful comments made against a marginalized group. If you feel like I missed something, please let me know and I'll be sure to update this list!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the fic and please let me know what you think in the comments. I'd especially love to hear how you think I did with characterization since I'm still pretty new to working with these characters. Hopefully I do them justice!</p>

I ranted about my issues with this on tumblr the other day, and then last night I was in A Mood and decided I wanted to write a fic about it. If Recovery Girl is one of your faves, you probably won’t enjoy this, so I’d advise keeping that in mind before you decide to read! </p>
<p>Obviously, there are parts of this that I took liberty with, hence the canon divergence tag. But the core of the scene that inspired the idea sticks to canon. </p>

<p>Wow, so uh, hi! A lot of you like this fic! Like, waaaaay more of you than I expected. I don’t really know what to say other than thank you! </p>
<p>This isn’t a continuation of the main fic, but I felt inspired to write out two scenes that could have made it into the fic if I had chosen a different focus or route. I thought people might enjoy reading a few bonus scenes, just for fun! </p>

<p>Izuku's time is up.</p>
<p>The end!</p>","<p>Hi everyone! This is my very first BNHA fic, so I hope you enjoy. Just a quick note, the story has heavy themes of suicide, depression, abuse, self-esteem issues, etc - so if that bothers you, please, don't feel like you have to read.</p>
<p>Also, this is a time travel fic set in a universe where Izuku doesn't receive OFA! Instead he gets thrown into the past and meets Teen!Aizawa and Teen!Hizashi.</p>
<p>Title of the fic is from the song ""Everglow"" by Starset - highly recommend it!!! I feel like it suits the fic very well.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Hope you guys like the fic so far! This was originally intended to be a fic with just Aizawa &amp; Izuku, but it fit so much better with Hizashi that I couldn't help but include him. Now they're both gonna be a part of Izuku's stay, and I think it works. Hope you guys agree! Also, the funky timeline will be addressed and explained in later chapters, so don't worry if it's a little confusing atm.</p>
<p>Reviews/comments/questions/etc are always welcome!!</p>
<p>PS: anybody who says Aizawa Shouta isn't an inherently passionate and caring person can catch these hands, being less expressive doesn't mean shit!!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Chapter 3 done! How does everyone like it so far? I personally feel like Aizawa was probably more talkative in high school, before he got into official Pro Hero work.</p>
<p>Also, I know it's mostly been third-person focused on Aizawa and Izuku, so I'm thinking of adding a later chapter more from Hizashi's perspective. Let me know what you guys think!</p>
<p>See you for the next chapter soon!</p>
<p>Hey all, notes at the beginning this time, as just a warning: Izuku has a panic attack this chapter. It does have to do with the story, so it's necessary, but just keep it in mind as you read! If you need to skip, please don't push yourself to read it!</p>
<p>As always, please let me know what you think of this chapter - and the story so far!</p>

<p>Izuku is a happy boi for once!!!! Shouta doesn't know it yet but he would die for that green bean's smile</p>
<p>Sorry for a shorter chapter this time, I hope you all like it anyways - and oh my gosh!!!! This story has over 100 kudos and nearly 900 hits?!?! What the heck, I feel so loved in the club tonight</p>
<p>Next chapter is going to be tooth-rotting fluff before we move back to the angst, I hope you guys look forward to it!</p>

<p>Another shorter chapter, but one I hope is still good!! Plenty of fluff is good for the soul you know! Principal Nedzu low-key adopting Izuku without Izuku realizing it is my new favorite thing now lmao</p>

<p>Shouta is ready to murder some peeps, better hope he doesn't find you in the future bakugou (also sorry ik i'm making bakugou super evil in this fic but I can't help it aaaa)</p>

<p>Also! A small note to my lovely readers!!<br>THANK YOU!!!! Your support means the world, and each comment, kudo and bookmark makes me so, so happy. I haven't properly written fanfic in a long time, so it's wonderful to have it received so positively!

But he only opened the door further and told Tommy that they'd get it all sorted out in a few days.

<p>Dokja remembers the feel of Unbroken Faith in his hands, how it feels to die, and watching Yoo Jonghyuk (unscarred and almost hopeful) from the windows of a subway car, but he has no context for it, no timeline.</p>
<p>Trading fingers for Yoo Jonghyuk’s happiness, wings sprouting from his back, the strange sensation of turning into a ghost, his fingers turning into wisps of smoke in a tunnel.</p>
<p>“Omniscient Reader?” he reads aloud, uncertain. “Interesting name for a novel.”</p>
<p>“You’ve read it before,” she says, eyes shining. “But I think you’ll enjoy it.”</p>

<p>hey folks! just a quick note—i am all for people taking inspiration from what i write—after all it’s fanfic, none of us own this anyway. However i would still like to be credited if you clearly take inspiration from my work/borrow parts of my writing. It’s disheartening to see writing i put effort into blatantly taken by someone else—but i totally understand this happens accidentally and i bear no ill will. Please please please let me know/credit me in some way, it will make me so so happy.</p>

<p>and that’s a wrap folks! so sorry for the delay on this chapter—college apps absolutely kicked my ass. now that march is approaching i guess i’ll start to see whether it payed off or not…</p>
<p>i really really enjoyed writing this fic and never expected it to get as many kudos/comments as it did. I reread comments on this all the time whenever I feel sad, and I really need to get around to responding to all of them haha. orv really destroyed me and this fic was a good way for me to make myself satisfied with the ending lmaoooo</p>
<p>i’m def rereading orv soon because writing this fic has made me fall in love with it again and also to refresh my memory</p>
<p>anyways i’m thinking about writing another fic for this, from the pov of kim dokja’s company. idk how long until that happens (i am a notoriously slow writer and i have so many wips)</p>
<p>but thank you all for the love and comments i appreciate it so much</p>
<p>please please come bother me on tumblr, lostonmyroad.tumblr.com</p>

(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>This fic was written for three reasons:</p>
<p>First, to share the painful process of making sense of who you are when you were raised in an environment that told you who you are is wrong. And how sometimes, the people we love most who were raised the same way, will struggle to accept you as well. And the journey of unlearning is long and hard, but not undoable if done with love.</p>
<p>Second, inspiration from a novel called The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo which shook me to my fucking core and gave me a better understanding of myself and the LGBT community.</p>
<p>Third, because this year, at age twenty-one, I came out to my friends, some of my family, and to myself - as a lesbian. </p>
<p>Everything is so much better but everything is also still scary, even right now. But I hope everyone who is currently in the same place as Sakusa was, or in the same place that I was, you get something good from this story. One day, we'll all get there. Hell, I still have to convince myself of that sometimes, so we're in this together!</p>

<p>Haha anyway please leave a comment so I know I'm not writing into the void and/or drop a kudos if you feel so inclined</p>
<p>Hello folks!</p>
<p>I read all your comments. The most requested thing was for me to write both the pre-planned fic and also the Loki fic. I like this plan. I shall turn this into a series. The first in the series will not go much into Loki at all. The only thing I am changing is that the originally intended epilogue for this fic will be moved to the next fic. After this fic ends, Harry will continue on with adventures in the TVA. I can't tell you any more than that because spoilers, but I've already started outlining that one so hooray. </p>
<p>It will probably be called ""Harry Potter and the Hourglass of Life""</p>
<p>Idk what the series as a whole will be called yet. But yeah, if you like Loki, you'll get Loki, you just have to wait a bit. If you don't like Loki/care about the TV show, don't read the next fic in this series. </p>
<p>And that's all from me, folks. Thanks for giving me your comments!</p>
<p>CONTENT WARNING:<br>The following section will include descriptions of death, building damage, suicide attempts, and medical treatment.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>So I know there wasn't a whole lot of Harry/Thor in that fic chapter -- or none at all -- but I promise there will be more next chapter. Why Harry ends up where he does will be explained next chapter. I just needed a chapter that acknowledged how traumatic and terrible the snap was and May needed to be the one to show that. The MCU really just glossed over the Snap and it bothered me.</p>
<p>Yes, I took liberties with this chapter and the MCU timeline. I just kinda liked it this way. Please leave a comment/kudos if you feel so inclined.</p>
<p>Harry: I can heals the people.<br>Thor: Go heals them then.<br>Harry: But what if they call me a witch and try to burn me at the stake?<br>TQP: You're immortal. You'll survive.</p>
<p>I'm baaack ladies and gentlemen. Also Loki's ending was awful and I'm not sure about advertising that one so there. This chapter was inspired by ""i used to have nothing and then"" by ""dirgewithoutmusic"" which you should all go and read. I really liked the way dirgewithoutmusic presented the soul stone and I used a similar structure with this chapter. Hope this was worth the wait and thank you everyone for waiting.</p>
<p>I will start responding to comments soon :)</p>

<p>Thor: Where's my screentime?<br>TQP: Where's MY screentime?<br>Loki: Oh, how cute. You think you have problems. Well, I got a whole lot of screentime in this solo TV show with like seven thousand different versions of MYSELF and then I couldn't even get any kind of ENDING. I don't have an ENDGAME like the both of you so why don't you just stop complaining? Huh?<br>TQP: Your brother's touchy.<br>Thor: He's adopted</p>
<p>Heeeey sorry about the long hiatus. We're two chapters from the end now. I was really busy this semester but this fic is now my #1 priority and will be done, I promise, by January 27th. Maybe earlier. Thanks for your patience.</p>

You win.<br>Thor: I do. </p>
<p>Please leave kudos if you feel so inclined, or a comment to know I am not writing into the void</p>
<p>I find it hysterical how many people enjoy this fic. To be honest, I wrote out my other two fics to have like themes and overarching stories and plots. Especially Dripping Fingers. That fic has a 26 page document I use to keep track of all the things I need to keep track of. This fic is not like those other fics. (not like the other girls.) I wrote this fic to be purely self-indulgent. I was just like, ""eh may as well make it public."" Thanks for indulging me with this and your comments.</p>
<p>If you are interested in my other works, I have two HP fics called Another Mind Game and Dripping Fingers (prior mentioned) I highly recommend.</p>
<p>Have you read both and are feeling interested in what I do outside of fic writing? Look up my book called ""Dear the Man Upstairs""</p>

But she was more than that. She was strong, smart, witty. Treacherous, arguably.<br>Thor: Sounds like you.<br>Loki: She WAS me.<br>Harry: Yikes.</p>

<p>So this was hella late but there was supposed to be a part with an Abyss Mage due to their theoretical connection between the Abyss Order and Khaenri'ah, and the more I wrote about it the more I hated it.

<p>Also, if this interests any of you, I posted my works in progress list over on tumblr! So if you want, you can go check it out and see what I'm working on writing next. I'll leave a link in the end notes if y'all want to check it out.</p>
<p>That being said, I hope you enjoy this! Not beta-read (unless you count Grammarly), so any mistakes are my own! Enjoy!!</p>

<p>Midoriya Izuku does not know how to view the impressions analysis for his suddenly popular blog, and only notices that sometimes, people actually comment on his posts now. He does not google himself or his moniker and thus does not see the rise in online articles and speculation.</p>
<p>He is unaware that the ""kyuu-ei-bee"" he begins to hear about in passing refers to his own blog. He does not have a Twitter account.</p>

<p>name of the file this fic lives in is ""THIS IS NOT A CULT, GO HOME, midoriya screams into the abyss, convincing no one"", just thought u should know<br>i am... incredibly sorry for the incoming wall of text.<br> <br><b>technical notes/taken liberties: </b><br>- the intelligent members of the fandom commonly agree that bnha does NOT take place in the year 20XX, and mathematically, likely takes place in 22XX or 23XX. HOWEVER; the anime makes several references to 20XX, so uh that's what i went with. also the anime makes references to ""yahoo news"" (and no way yahoo is gonna be around that long) so i feel justified in just saying bnha is set in a parallel modern day universe. therein also lies my justification of the abuse of modern day social media sites.<br>- the reason i used 20X4 is bc bnha released in 2014 and im afraid i may need to increase the year counter at some point. (the first draft just used 20XX, but that was before things got ~out of hand~.)<br>- ""shuttai"" is an alternate reading of the kanji used for ""izuku"" (well... sort of. don't think about it too hard)<br>- ive decided to include japanese honorifics for. reasons? (i think i had a real reason at one point but i cant remember now so im just going to trust past!me on this one.)<br>- - i have spent several hours watching random bnha clips youtube and hulu in the original japanese to figure out what everyone uses for honorifics bc they sure do localize bnha, dont they :/ i had to guess on a few.<br>- in japanese, when you're talking to (or about) someone on the internet, you generally use '-san'. im going to be taking a looot of liberties here and mixing and matching the way engish speakers and japanese speakers talk to each other online, partially for convenience, partially for flow. (you probably wont notice, but ive lost sleep over it.)<br>- we're using military time bc thats the staple in japan.<br>- after mirio comes to terms with midoriya's blog post, he changes his online handle(s) to ""pacman"". i have yet to smuggle this in anywhere and am incredibly sad.</p>
<p><b>warnings:</b><br>- i have NOT figured out the theoretical days of the week for this theoretical year bc my brand of crazy only takes me so far.<br>- im pulling from the bnha:illegals crew. just know they exist i guess? (koichi, kazuho, and iwao.)<br>- i have several ideas for how this fic will go, but rn im only promising you ""part 1"". part 1 will be standalone. part 1 is complete sans editing and sans a metric buttload of html.<br>- i do not know html. i've spent the last two weekends learning (/suffering) and being forced to create my own workskins bc ao3 hates spaces.<br>- i played around with a lot of different types of formatting before settling on what i hope comes across as ""minimalistic but still recognizable and nice to look at"". if i did not succeed, i only want to know if it's a small, fixable thing; otherwise, i prefer to live in semi-satisfied ignorance. thank you for your understanding and cooperation.<br>- i am still not happy with the spacing between lines during texting rants but i am also very, very tired. i might circle back.<br>- i am still not happy with how i've got sort-of-but-not-really right-aligned text working, but this is likely NOT changing bc ive spent the last 8h just getting it to this point.<br>- i have not quite decided how to handle transitions and am liable to change it. suggestions welcome, i guess?</p>
<p><b>final notes:</b><br>- if you notice any weird errors (particularly in the html) please, please let me know!<br>- google now thinks im a robot and i have to keep clicking the 'im not a robot' captcha. apparently googling html terms is suspicious??<br>- ive never had to make such a detailed timeline in my life and i dont care for it at all and now that we're live im just praying i dont have to go back and change the timeline and all the date/timestamps AGAIN<br>- ao3, why u no support flexbox :(</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr authors notes: </strong><br>- uh, dont worry about the stuff kouichi did? its legit and makes midoriya much harder to find/track<br>- fun fact, yap!news is bnha canon<br>- haha yeah so how about that stain guy<br><strong>gratuitously unnecessary authors notes: </strong><br>- blockquotes are so cute?? like omg time to update all my summaries bc ~ b l o c k q u o t e s ~<br>- layering blockquotes is :( not allowed :(<br>- thusly, (multiple) vertical lines are hell<br>- i invented a college for kouichi. i thought about it long and hard and felt very clever. i thought it was important that u know i suffered over a fake email address that shows up exactly once and may never be used again. am i stupid.<br>- i forged a whois report. i forged. an entire whois report. why did i do that. why am i like this.<br>- i need you to believe me the whois report is incredibly accurate.<br>- i also need you to know that it's actually like three times as long and was in the original draft and on some readthrough a while back i was all, ""wait, w. why did you include this entire thing."" and the answer was ""because i doctored the entire thing and it was hard"" but that wasnt enough reason to make the final cut.<br>- so one time i ordered this sketchy thing from a kickstarter and it never showed up. no tracking number, no emails. i emailed the help email but a week went by with no response. i called the listed help number but it was an automated voice with no actual help to offer. so i ran whois against the website for the inventor guy and snagged his phone number and called him up, all ""hey uh, sorry to bother you but can you help me get my thing, i dont think it shipped"" and he was all *""who is this, how did you get this number""*. it was his personal cell. he did help me out tho.<br>- moral of this story is *BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU SET UP A WEBSITE*.<br>- yap!news is used in actual bnha but i cant find it on the wiki/reddit/anywhere? i promise its a thing, i was watching the anime and remember laughing at it and writing it down. it's obviously a play on yahoo!news, which i might not have realized except that it's the End All Be All news source for like. japan. i dont make the rules and am just as confused as you are.<br>- at one point during the html testing process, i angered the html gods and had to take a very long break: https://imgur.com/a/cFonEc3<br>- i think im almost done with examples for every kind of media i include in season 1. this is very exciting bc i can maybe stop dying in html every weekend and get back to actual writing.<br>- on the other hand, im not sure if ao3 will let me put three vertical lines next to each other, and idk how nesting divs works? so im currently living in the happy world of not knowing and thinking, logically, it'll be fine. but having spent so much time with ao3 trying to ""help me out"" and html being the worst thing ever invented, i think im going to be spending a lot of time crying in the near future.<br>- (sorry html i didnt mean it i love u)<br>- but like at that point do i alter the actual text/story vs letting the formatting suffer? how am i suppose to make that choice because i KNOW i'll choose the formatting and i also know that's very much not what i should do.<br>- re: vertical lines are HELL<br>- ch3 is a lil more exciting, but ch 4 is where it's AT (as in, where hawks is at bc he shows up again briefly and i just love him okay)</p>

<p><b>so anyway:</b><br>- first and foremost, you CAN nest vertical lines, it just makes you want to tear your hair and eyeballs out<br>- but DID YOU SEE? NESTED VERTICAL LINES. BOOYAH.<br>- chapter count has been upped bc i split a chapter in half.<br>- it'll likely go up again bc 1, im bad at math and 2, 10 is a better number than 9.<br>- 'suiran' is a reference to 'arashi', a (Very) popular jpop boys band. they use the same kanji, bc i like to make dumb obscure kanji jokes. (翠嵐 - suiran; 嵐 - arashi)<br>- i dont think ive ever heard an arashi song so idk if they're any good?<br>- kouichi doesnt know what/who suiran is, but he knows it would make Kazuho mad if she found out. im hoping to smuggle that in at some point, but if i dont manage it, at least now you know.<br>- thanks to Mayhap_Mishap for the libel/slander fix<br>- i had to rewrite the timeline again and it ate my whole weekend :( but i shouldnt have to do it again for arc1. (im trying not to think about arc2.)<br>- i made some formatting edits to previous chapters and will likely do so again but im tired rn<br>- ""no one will notice"" i say out loud; ""you cannot unknow your own sins"" my brain whispers<br>- i have come to the realization that this is the most ambitious writing project ive ever attempted and have started to sweat.</p>

<p><b>ch4 notes:</b><br>- semi-major, not at all important, retroactively updated formatting in previous chapters. i keep figuring out how to do things i'd given up on.<br>- (updates are mostly ch1 and a little of ch3. i was too tired for ch2, maybe later.)<br>- i was split between ""chi-chan"" and ""hime-chan"" (chi being blood and hime being princess) so lemme know if you've got a preference. they're both dumb enough to be funny to me<br>- i turned on discord light to check how things were formatted against a white background and i still feel unsettled from looking at it<br>- have i finally gone too far with the colored background squares?? i thought about not putting them in but. they're so pretty.<br>- i was gonna have some people use actual text/sms in this chapter, but i couldnt in good faith do it. no one uses sms in japan, it's all line all the time. (and some messenger, but ugh no thanks)<br>- ""ku"" means. uh. ward? it's like an area of a prefecture.<br>- (you can skip this next part if you dont care about physical location details)<br>- japan's split up weird, but lets talk about tokyo.<br>-- tokyo is a prefecture. tokyo is split into 23 ""wards"".<br>-- in japanese, 'ward' is 'ku'. so harajuku is in 'shinjuku-ku'. i am physically incapable of using the word ward, it confuses me. when i was hearing kamino spoilers through the grapevine and everyone kept saying 'kamino ward' i was 100% sure the kamino arc took place in a hospital.<br>-- basically, if you see ""-ku"", it's an area in tokyo.<br>- osaka is way south west of tokyo<br>- UA (and midoriya) are in shizuoka (south of Tokyo) but i feel like the majority of crimes would happen in tokyo. (lots of hero agencies seem to be in tokyo, including best jeanist and all might's agencies.) so uh. QAB messes around in tokyo a lot, dont worry about it<br>- this fic is starting to feel like 'today i learned html could do X, and then tried to make it do my bidding. come, listen to the agonized screaming of my soul' but if y'all r still here, then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p><b>n o t e s :</b><br>- i didnt mean to write an interlude, it just happened. i was looking at ~1k of consecutive, todoroki-centric content, and screamed at myself ""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS."" my brain screamed back, ""AN INTERLUDE, IDK, JUST RUN WITH IT""<br>- increased ch count to 10 just like i threatened. im actually p pleased bc 10 is such a good number.<br>- next chapter: get ready for a useless info dump on japanese ssns and the borderline irresponsible mixing of japanese and american ssn history/lore, id be more excited if i hadnt made it so much work for myself, why did i do this</p>
<p><b>c o m p l a i n t s : </b><br>- i crafted a whole second discord layout bc i figured kouichi would be using the desktop version of discord during this chapter, but i couldn't get it to look okay on both desktop and mobile versions of ao3 so a scrapped it and i am just super sad okay, i really wanted to use that format<br>- there's a known issue wherein on some devices (ie, only one device that i know of and it isn't mine), right aligned text appears inexplicably smaller than all other text. im hoping this is an extremely isolated incident bc i dont think there's anything i can do about it, i tried really hard, i promise :(<br>- (this has been a known issue from the start but i only recently took a serious stab at trying to fix it so idr if i mentioned it before or not.)</p>
<p><b>from this point on im just going to complain about html gratuitously, u can leave if u want. this is the abbreviated version, can u believe: </b><br>- i didnt want to bore you with too many of the details but BOY OH BOY WAS THERE SUFFERING IN THIS HOUSE<br>- the problem is, its not even anything that matters. ive just been trying for the last two weeks (not like, straight, but there were a few all-nighters) to get things to like, fade out? bc i. i needed it. i learned it existed and was all ""yeah we need that right now immediately""<br>- lowkey i think my brain just wants to make ch1 the most beautiful mock-up known to man, who knows<br>- btw uh. i updated the formatting on ch1 again.<br>- so anyway i did it after much blood and tears and screaming and y'all are lucky my computer was out of commission this week (y'all being the operative term for ""you unfortunate saps on apple devices""). this is because if it hadn't been, i never would have in a thousand years touched safari and found out transparent doesnt work the same<br>- whys this you ask? BECAUSE APPLE HATES CONFORMING AND LIKES TO MAKE UP DUMB ARBITRARY RULES TO MAKE THE REST OF US SUFFER is all i can come up with<br>- had to hit up my art degree sister and be all ""what is rgba"" and she was all ""what do u mean u dont know what rgba is, how is this possible, have u never used an art program"" and im still a little iffy on the 'a'<br>- anyway imma add a fade out thing to the next chapter (that was the whole point of this madness) and probably add it in to previous chapters where it makes sense to do so (ie. basically everywhere i can shove it bc i spent literal days of my life figuring out how to 1, do the thing, 2, do the thing on apple products)<br>- screw you, apple. &gt;:(</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>retroactive updates/formatting blah:</b><br>- YEAH HI GUESS WHAT SOMEONE ONLY JUST NOW TOLD ME IVE BEEN GETTING KOICHI'S HERO/SCREEN NAME WRONG HALF THE TIME<br>- idk why but my brain thinks his name is charger when it is <em>absolutely crawler</em> and has been this whole time<br>- so @the person who finally told me, thanks!! but <em>how could i have let this happen</em><br>-- previous chapters have been fixed, future chapters not so much. i will do my best.<br>- i was messing w the spacing between dms, now that i finally figued out how to do it, but ao3 just. refuses. i use the exact same code in two places and the space. is different. i dont feel like screaming any more tonight, so im just gonna. come back later.<br>- added minute changes to previous chapters not worth specifing but i feel like there were lots and i just stopped paying attention<br>- the reddit 'see more' button was a step too far, i keep trying to click on it and <em>i wrote it</em></p>
<p><b>that reddit post: </b><br>- HOO BOY HOW ABOUT THAT NONSENSE I JUST SPOUTED ABOUT KOUJIN BANGOU AND QUIRKLESS POLITICS, HUH.<br>- (i am mixing the way the american SSN and japanese ""My Number""/Koujin Bangou functions bc this is the ~future~ and japan seems to take a lot of cues on how to do things based on western society.)<br>- the irl issue im drawing from is american SSNs and the fact that, when banks check to see if they can give you a loan but your birthday is past a certian date, they just dont even validate your identity bc it would cost them money.<br>- get this: SSNs are insecure. gov makes them more complicated/secure, and in doing so, harder to access. (which is the whole point.) but this means that it takes longer to get results and it's a more complicated process and requires more overhead (ie, they have to pay more people to handle this process.) banks/loan officers/etc say, wait, its gonna take how long? you're gonna *charge us*? ...nah, we don't need it, it's fine. #yolo<br>- this is a REAL THING that i am likely misremembering details of and couldnt find references for; dont worry about it (i tell myself, while worrying about it). this is fiction, yo.</p>
<p><b>misc:</b><br>- people are legit referring to me as 'format god' for some reason and i think this is hilarous and am half convinced i should put it on a business card<br>- HEY I REMEMBERED WHY I GAVE KOICHI A WHOLE EMAIL ADDRESS it's bc i reused his fake university in this chapter. (when did i do that?? good job, past me)<br>- i couldn't tell you why but this is my favorite chapter<br>-- okay i lied, i know why, it's hawks</p>

<p>my rough draft notes had ""[ending chapter here would build TENSION]"" and who was i to disagree</p>
<p><b>pre-finished chapter7:</b><br>- me, posting chapter 1: i think its pretty good! i think i did a good job! i will give this level of effort and i will go no further and i will be satisfied<br>- me, 7 rewrites of ch1 later: maybe i should just do it, maybe i should just make text boxes for twitter and signal and sms and line and they will all be different and you will have to rewrite every single chapter but maybe it's worth it</p>
<p><b>post-finished chapter7:</b><br>- yeah<br>- yeah that<br>- sure was some stuff i learned how to do this week<br>- remember when i was worried if i was taking things too far? this is it. this is what too far looks like. we've arrived.<br>- still retroactive fixing of chapters going on, ch2 is lookin pretty swanky<br>- i have not fixed ch1 to look like this chapter, i am tired, let me rest<br>- i found out today that a majority of my html problems are self-inflicted and im a little mad about it. like, its not surprising, we started this journey with 10k of chat-fic, a poorly thought out plan, and our best friend google; but im still mad<br>- sib called me sexy over the html coding of this chapter ;) which i think is grossly inaccurate and a misuse of the phrase, but ;)</p>

<p><b>and now, notes: </b><br>- this chapter was really tricky to write but i think i pulled it off? i think i like the end result.<br>- boy i hope the phone/homescreen/time sections don't look terrible on y'all's devices, boy would that suck after all that work<br>- html floats are LEGITIMENTLY black magic and i do not understand whats going on there or what secret properties they hold only that sometimes, if u throw a float on a thing, it breaks, and OTHER times, you throw a float on it, and it FIXES the thing, and there is no logic in this world.<br>- ""when in doubt, clear the buffer"" is my new mantra<br>- tbh it was always my mantra but i. forgot about it. there was a lot of suffering today bc i forgot my own mantra.<br>- i thought itd be fun to check how big my workskin file is, and the answer is: <strike>1540</strike> 1674 words.<br>- (i had to write ~100 lines of css to fix some weird issues this chapter)<br>- the spacing between centered boxes is still tragic and i dont like thinking about it. maybe next time.<br>- just in case anyone is unaware, the html basically doubles the word count on every chapter and this chapter is fRICKIN LONG<br>- i canNOT get timestamps to align to the bottom of the line message bubbles. i thought of one potential way but it would require rewriting a buuuunch of css code not to mention the html of almost every chapter, and thats assuming it even works like i want it to. so. i'll keep thinking about it, i guess.<br>- haha tried it, failed it, then remembered even if i managed it, ao3 doesnt respect tables, so. guess they get to be top aligned.<br>- dabi's new name in hawks' phone is a fnaf reference, my beta tells me it's funny<br>- i use the term 'beta' lightly as my beta refused to read this chapter because, and i quote, ""but i want to be surprised :( i want to Experience it Organically""<br>- 😒</p>

<p>Posted 12/27/20</p>
<p>So I wasn't really going to have another chapter but than I started to have ideas after reading a comment and here we are. I hope that you guys enjoy. This was fun to write.</p>
<p>Posted 1/2/21</p>
<p>Yet again a comment made me start having ideas so now there is this chapter. This chapter involves mentions of the Overhaul arc and Eri so if you haven't gotten to that part you might be the tiniest bit confused. Anyways hope you enjoy. :)</p>
<p>Also just know that in this chapter Midoriya is in his civilian clothes.</p>
<p>Posted 11/29/21</p>
<p>Alas I have returned to add more to Angry Scary Midoriya after getting an idea I couldn't resist ;p</p>

<p>Izuku had to learn it from someone, and who better than his own mother? A mother who wouldn't hesitate to do what it took to get her son back, with shape words and shape knives. Also, I love Inko who isn't afraid to use her quirk to hurt a bitch if needed (we stan an Inko who threaten people with a smile)</p>
<p>Also even with his life in danger Izuku will not stand for someone insulting his mother. </p>
<p>You can see why the league decided not to try to kidnap Izuku anymore. </p>

<p>is it even a party if jin ling doesn't stab an uncle?? i think not</p>
<p>was that supposed to be a serious moment? yes. but if all you could think of was that very funny scene in the punisher where pretty much the same thing happens - me too tbh</p>
<p>the jiang disciples all try and do shocked pikachu face when wwx's identity is reveled but they're not very good at it. everyone knew. he openly carried chenqing on lotus pier and jc wouldn't tolerate this level of bullshit from anyone less than family. </p>
<p>lwj has accepted that loving wwx means also loving his undead best friend and jc. the latter is a lot harder for him to deal with, but he's getting there. slowly. </p>
<p>lwj is very busy spending time with the love of his life and their son and learning not to hate jc, so he can't act as sect leader or be chief cultivator. this means lxc doesn't get to go in seclusion, but considering lwj was whipped 33 times and forced into three years of seclusion as punishment and then went around being a perfect lan for the next decade anyway, i'd say his debt to his clan is paid with interest. </p>
<p>nhs didn't even manipulate lxc into killing jgy this time, so lxc does have him to lean on. the next time they're all in one place wwx is like i know it was you bitch. and nhs is just like oohhh hohohoho what on earth are you talking about?? no one would ever believe you. glad you're back from the dead, which i definitely didn't have anything to do with, but if i did, you're welcome and exposing my secrets would be a terrible thank you, so keep that in mind</p>

<p>me @ myself: stop including unwarranted hawks angst, this is a dabi fic</p>
<p>my two braincells: hhnng sad bird man</p>
<p>me: no!</p>
<p>a n y w a y, this was originally supposed to be a oneshot, like 7k max, but now the doc i'm writing this in is over 50 pages and it's lagging enough that scrolling through it is like watching a slideshow, so i've decided to split this into two parts and write the home stretch of this (what will become chapter 2) in a separate doc, and hopefully have that up in time for christmas or new years!</p>
<p>i hope you enjoyed this, and happy holidays!</p>
<p>critics say this chapter is defined by it's severe emotional and tonal whiplash. now featuring 90% more hawks suffering. like. hawks goes through so much shit in this part.</p>
<p>i crunched this entire thing out in a week i swear i did not mean for it be this long. like i tried to edit this but it's so long that i wouldn't be surprised if there was a ton of mistakes.</p>
<p>the response to the first part of this was really overwhelming, and i'm blown away that people liked it so much! it really helped motivate me to get this second part done</p>
<p>anyway, enjoy the second and final part of whatever this is!</p>

<p>deleted scene:</p>
<p>aizawa, to midoriya: just because i said don't get arrested doesn't mean you had to go do the exact opposite and get kidnapped.</p>
<p>honestly, all the scenes after the one where toga started crying, or maybe after the token emotional scene between touya and keigo, feel like an obnoxious amount of end credit scenes, and i don't think i hate it.</p>
<p>in an unsurprising repeat of what happened with the first half of this, i only expected this part to be like 10k max, just to wrap up the story, but almost 30k later, here we are. i actually considered splitting this into two parts and making this story three parts, but decided against it since i'd promised it to be two.</p>
<p>anyway, this story was a lot of fun to write, and i really hope you all enjoyed it! happy holidays!</p>

<p>I hope you guys enjoyed this! I've been rather nervous about finishing this fic since it got all of this attention. I hope you're not too terribly disappointed— I was thinking of getting more into the OFA reveal at the end there and whatnot, but the emotional core of the story had already finished and I just felt like it was better to end it there. Anyway, thank you all for reading, and remember: if you ever have someone inside of your head, think about egg facts.</p>
<p>EDIT 8/10/2021: I've gotten so many people asking for egg facts that I've actually compiled some in <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/72253920?page=12&amp;show_comments=true&amp;view_full_work=false#comment_455464108"" rel=""nofollow"">this comment</a>. I hope you guys enjoy. </p>

<p>Me, opening the fridge: did you know that brown eggs cost more because the chickens that lay brown eggs are bigger? Also, some chickens lay blue eggs because of a disease that led to a mutation in their DNA. Also also, this one chef found that if you feed chickens a diet high in red peppers, it would make their egg yolks strawberry colored.</p>

<p>Also, I mentioned this already in one reply, but ORIGINALLY I didn't plan on there being more in this universe. But then my documents magically opened themselves and a Thorin POV started appearing (surprisingly, the Thorin POV does not, in fact, consist of nothing but ""Bilbo. Bilbo Bilbo Bilbo, Bilbo.

<p>y'all i just want to add that, while i know at least a fair amount of ASL, japanese sign language is obviously not the same thing. i've attempted to do some research, because i would hate to portray anything inaccurately, but resources on english to JSL are not very common apparently lol. because of this, my descriptions of the signing in this work are going to be influenced by my knowledge of how ASL is structured since that is the best i can do with the resources i have. the characters are still using JSL, though, and if any point someone who is well-versed in this than i am notices i have made an error or written something inaccurate, please let me know. i'm doing the best with what i can. </p>
<p>ALSO: chapter count has gone up by one! I just really wanted to end this here, ladies and gentlepeople, i'm sure you understand why. Next chapter will go up friday (maybe Thursday if i get it done and feel like y'all deserve a treat), and then I'll get crackin' on the next fic in the series, so if u want more of this au make sure you subscribe to the series as a whole. </p>
<p>see y'all then!</p>

<p>In this universe, thanks to Jason’s tip, Batman looks into Sheila Haywood much, much earlier, and discovers that she’s Jason’s birth mom. Jason feels horrible for a little while, but ultimately ignores it because he has his own fiercely protective Mama Bird.</p>
<p>In this universe, Dick does not get into a loud argument with Bruce and storm away from home, because there’s a twelve-year-old kid who’s imprinted on him and he has to set a good example. (Bruce is not above using this argument in pointing out the virtues of a college education.)</p>
<p>In this universe, Dick passes the Robin mantle to Jason when he’s ready, and tells him about the special meaning behind the name. Jason nearly bursts into tears then and there, Bruce’s eyes are suspiciously shiny, and Alfred has to dot at his eyes with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>(In this universe, Jason tells them about the little sister that likes waffles, so Dick promptly adopts Spoiler the moment they find out her favorite food.)</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Jason, starry-eyed: is it my turn to get a baby brother from the dimension storks?<br>Bruce: that’s not how it—well, I guess that is how it works now.</p>
<p>In this universe, Bruce works out some sort of ‘temporary’ guardianship with Tim’s parents so that Tim stays with them whenever they’re out of the country. (This is an arrangement that is acceptable to all parties involved, except Jason, who really wanted to break some noses.)</p>
<p>In this universe, Jason has a little brother to steer his impulses towards benign things, like starting a prank war, whenever he gets angry at Bruce and Dick’s moral philosophies. On one memorable occasion, Tim manages to distract him from his growing argument with Bruce by admitting he’s never read Pride and Prejudice, leading to an impressively detailed rant stretching over a full week.</p>
<p>In this universe, Jason hands the Robin mantle over to Tim in a solemn ceremony, interspersed by Dick’s tears and unsubtle hints that the name ‘Flamebird’ has not yet been taken. Tim can’t quite control the twitching of his lips as Jason pointedly ignores Dick.</p>
<p>(In this universe, they don’t figure out who Hood is, or how he knows so much about them—though Tim has his suspicions, especially after hearing Jason’s adoption story.)</p>
<p>Content warning: implied/referenced animal death.</p>

</p>
<p>Tim, snatching Damian: <em>ha</em>, I finally got one of my own!<br>Bruce: but he’s <em>my</em>—you know what, I give up.</p>
<p>In this universe, Damian is intimidated by his older siblings and mostly clings to Tim. Tim cements his position of favorite sibling ever by introducing Damian to Selina. Between Tim’s logical arguments and careful coaching of puppy-dog eyes, Bruce is helpless to resist the plans for Damian’s menagerie. (Everyone coos over the baby kitten that Damian carries everywhere.)</p>
<p>In this universe, thanks to the detailed information left behind, Bruce finds and promptly adopts Cassandra Cain <strike>before any of his children have the chance to snatch another sibling</strike>. He also works off of the groundwork to destroy a large portion of the League’s operations and relegate Ra’s back to the shadows. (Bruce and Talia have a long shouting match concerning kidnapping children and lying about miscarriages, but eventually a custody agreement is worked out.)</p>
<p>In this universe, Tim passes the Robin mantle to Damian in a move designed to distract Dick and Jason while Tim disappears to follow the trail of a missing Bruce. The deception holds up for all of twenty hours before Tim—new alias Crow—is dragged back from Europe by Cass and both Tim and Damian are grounded while the Justice League works on getting Bruce unstuck from the timestream.</p>
<p>(In this universe, they all wonder about the Bats from the other dimension and what exactly they’re up to—but it takes a few years before they finally get an explanation.)</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>When Batman gets home a week later, he immediately confiscates the portal gun. Unfortunately, the damage is already done—they’ve saved Jason from death five times, kidnapped Damian from the League in seven dimensions, stolen Steph in two, lured Cass to the family four times, roped Tim into the family earlier thrice, and prevented the Graysons’ death once. Not to mention the one where tired single dad Bruce is in charge of one teenager, two preteens, two young children, and a wailing newborn.</p>
<p>Bruce resists the urge to travel to that dimension to give Alfred a raise.</p>"

<p>Before you continue, make sure you've read the tags. I've had a comment or two about a specific trope I've used etc, and I've done my best to tag everything so if you see something you dislike, this fic probably isn't for you.</p>
<p>That isn't to say 'don't like don't read'. Everyone is welcome to read my fics, but at the end of the day this fic is almost entirely crack and something I've written for fun, so it will differ from canon, and there will be characters I make the butt of the joke. This is just a pre-emptive warning, and it does not mean that I dislike those characters or believe that the way I've written them is how they actually are in canon.</p>
<p>Also if I haven't tagged something you think needs to be tagged, go ahead and let me know! I think its super important people know what they're getting into.</p>
<p>With that said, I hope you enjoy! &lt;3</p>

<p>so it's been a while. I've just done two 48 hour exams a week apart and I'm finally done (almost) with this year of uni! This means that I'll be able to update a little more often. It also means that this chapter is largely unedited because I really wanted to post it and I finished my exam two days ago.</p>
<p>Hope you guys enjoy! &lt;3</p>

<p>Nezu ships Erasermic :-)</p>

<p>There's been some confusion so I'm just gonna mention here that Mirio isn't actually a traitor and Aizawa isn't actually expelling him. Aizawa is just being a drama queen because he's figured out who was supplying Izuku with his intel.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, the kid that got expelled was absolutely Mineta.</p>
<p>Aizawa 100% jumped on the first excuse to expel him.</p>

<p>the Play series is now complete. i hope u enjoyed this!!</p>
<p>yes, this is actually the last and final chapter of Play. this is why i waited after april first to publish. to be honest, writing one-shots only gets so repetitive to me. i prefer making an actual series with a real story behind it. and good lord i'm never writing a one-shot fic on ao3 ever again.</p>
<p>even though Play has ended, that doesn't mean i'm gonna stop writing for you guys. it would mean so so so so so much to me if you support my other stories coming up soon, maybe in late april or may.</p>
<p>i believe you all saw this on my last update that all my one-shots will only be on tumblr. speaking of tumblr, Special Treatment (a Doctor!Nanami x Fem!Reader fic) is already published!</p>
<p>real quick, thank you all so much. really. the support i've been receiving on twitter, tiktok, tumblr, literally everywhere is insane and i love you all so much. i'm so grateful that Play ended on a very good note. i'm also extremely grateful for you guys. i'm happy, as a fic writer, that i was able to fulfill your standards and expectations. i apologize to my male readers tho 😭 i have never written a male reader fic, but i will try my best to write one if i can.</p>

<p>or</p>
<p>5 times percy's coworkers were confounded by his fish magic, plus 1 time they try to figure it out</p>
<p>Melody stared through the tank’s slightly fogged glass and into the water, admittedly a little in awe.</p>
<p>They had walked in on their coworker playing with the small blue shark some 30 minutes ago in his goggles and wetsuit, that ballpoint pen he was weirdly attached to still somehow in his pocket even as he swam around under the water. His old beaded necklace floated loosely around his neck.</p>
<p>The strangest thing?</p>
<p>He didn’t have an oxygen tank on.</p>
<p>Ciara had spent her whole life learning about animals in her spare time. Ever since she was a child, she would pour over her National Geographic magazines and read until her eyes were swimming with scientific names, fun facts, and any other tidbit of knowledge she could get her hands on. She knew their diets, their habitats, their behaviors. </p>
<p>She knew which animals were friendly, which ones were aggressive, which ones were just curious, and which ones were scared.</p>
<p>But she had never seen one seem so starstruck.</p>
<p>“New Rome University is a private university in New Rome, California, founded in the late 1600s, graduation rate 100%... acceptance rate .5%?” He read off the screen, his face scrunching up in confusion towards the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>Melody leaned over his shoulder and raised an eyebrow, “That’s oddly specific, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Very. Where even is New Rome? I’ve never heard of the town either.”</p>
<p>Melody hummed in agreement and Marcus typed something new in.</p>
<p>The duo blinked in surprise when the results loaded.</p>

<p>Normally, Elaine Rudolph absolutely adored them. Crashing down gently on the sand, making calming noises and leaving soft seafoam in their wake. She truly loved them.</p>
<p>Right now, however, as she was being tossed around and trapped beneath them, she did not.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>percy seems to be immune to waves. no matter how rough or unforgiving they were, they just seemed to break around him</p>
<p>Everyone blinked at Melody.</p>
<p>“Alright, I rescind my earlier statement. We’re gossiping about Percy while he’s gone, and it is totally moral and okay because he’s fucking weird. Agreed?” Marcus announced, throwing his hands up in exasperation.</p>
<p>Everyone around the table nodded with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Truth be told, nobody really knew much about Percy, other than his spooky ability to seemingly telepathically communicate with animals and his love for his wife. Everybody was at least a little bit curious.</p>

<p>this anime is so cute!!! renga are so cute!!! i like the thought that reki has a big crush on langa, but doesn't believe it going anywhere, so he doesn't try pursuing him. meanwhile, langa is so unconsciously drawn to reki, of course he'd say yes in the end...!</p>
<p>langa is ridiculously gorgeous, and of course i heard that he's bad with feelings because he just doesn't comprehend them well, so he'd be the oblivious heartbreaker in my mind.</p>
<p>i would like to write more for them, but frankly i don't know what i'd write. i don't know shit about skateboarding, so i thought i'd tap back into what i'm familiar with: stupid boys</p>

<p>just a psa, I was not trying to get you to like Mina, just explain some actions. I am not condoning anything bad either of them have done, but mental illness makes you do bad shit sometimes and that can fuck with other people. I am in no way saying you have to like her, but please don’t attack me for presenting reasonings for characters actions.

<p>Wow... it's over. this fic has been such a journey for me as someone who was really just writing about their struggles. If you take anything for this, it's that you don't have to revert to the person from before to be happy. Trauma and mental illness do define you in ways, in little spaces of yourself you feel like you can never clean. That doesn't mean you can't be happy if some parts of you are tainted. I promise you will be alright. The person who was happy is still you, and they still have a chance.</p>

He taps his hands, pushes people away, and has never had a best friend. He's a screwed up, forgotten kid lost in the foster system. He's also just been placed with a new family. Tommy knows how this goes, he never ends up staying long. After all, no one wants a fuck up like him.</p>
<p>Why would this house be any different?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Or: the obligatory sbi foster au, but with a focus on the neurodivergent kids that inevitably get lost in the system.</p>
<p>Here he goes again. Another foster home, another fuck up, another time being returned into the system. Tommy knows how the cycle goes, why should this time be any different?</p>
<p>Day two with this weird ass family has Tommy questioning every single rule he's ever learned in the system.</p>
<p>Tommy goes shopping and attempts to figure out where he fits in with the dynamic of this weird-ass family. It's harder then it seems, because nothing about them makes sense.</p>
<p>Tommy has his first day of school, learns more about the family dynamics, and makes a friend. In that order. He thinks?</p>
<p>Tommy's been at this new month for about a month now. The honeymoon period is about to be up.</p>
<p>Tommy's sliding into place, building a strong friendship with Tubbo and slowly relearning past truths, beginning to understand that he can be exactly who he truly is. He's getting there. Slowly, very slowly.</p>
<p>Tommy bonds a bit with Wilbur and learns a few things about his history. The holidays draw closer and things don't go wrong. Tommy finally finds himself somewhere that he belongs.</p>
<p>A few challenges pop up in the lives of the people around Tommy. But even so, things work out. They work out and things are good and then Phil... well Phil asks the question.</p>
<p>Well... fucking with Techno didn't work. Guess he's going to need to take it a step further. But first, Tommy needs to do some reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Tommy took Wilbur's meds. There's only a few ways this can play out.</p>

<p>This has all been completed beforehand, and I plan to put out a new chapter every four to seven days. Not exactly sure yet.</p>
<p>But yeah, I've always loved foster fics but I feel like a lot of them don't have a lot of understanding of how the foster system works. which is okay! oftentimes your not reading those fics to learn about the foster system lol. but i wanted to highlight how things like mental illness and neurodivergence get amplified in the system and don't receive proper care. Foster kids with disabilities and mental illness, especially ones that are older, have a much more difficult time being placed with a forever home.</p>

<p>Phil chuckled. “It basically means that you are going to be following me or another bird hybrid around all day, and you won’t stop peeping like that unless you have physical contact with that person.”</p>

<p>Or, the fic in which Tommy peeps like a baby chick, gets lots of cuddles, and has really fluffy wings</p>
<p>Mr. Nook looked up and smiled when he saw Tommy snuggled up against Technoblade. All of the other students looked up from their tests as well, and Tommy resisted the temptation to hide his face in Technoblade’s sweater. As it was, Technoblade wrapped one of his pink wings around him protectively.</p>
<p>“Hey, Tommy,” Mr. Nook said kindly, “You got your wings in recently?”</p>
<p>Tommy forced himself to speak. “Yeah,” he said, “Pretty pog, yeah?”</p>

Well, between him and Dream, I'm putting this disclaimer in all my fics. These characters are not the CCs, nor do they reflect my opinion on them. Either separate the two or don't read the fic.

Because it's Bruce—who's allergic to revealing life-changing information—the League is left in the dark.</p>
<p>This story is written as 5+1 story from the Justice League's POV as they attempt to define the weird relationship between Batman and Captain Marvel. 5 times they didn't realize Batman had adopted Captain Marvel, and the 1 time they did.</p>","<p>So, I've been reading a lot of Billy Batson fics lately. I love them all dearly, but I'm especially fond of the fics where the Batfam adopts him. There aren't nearly enough of them, so I decided I'd try my hand at one—I hope I managed to do the trope justice!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and if you want to read a really good Batfam &amp; Billy fic, I'd recommend checking out A Natural Progression by Starkvenger!</p>

<p>I apologize to any Cass and Duke lovers reading this... I'm not very familiar with their personalities, so while I love reading about them in other people's Batfamily fics, I don't have a good enough grasp on them as characters to write them just yet.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've just been informed that the Diana ice cream thing is from the Texts from Superheros Tumblr! Thank you for helping me give credit to original poster!</p>
<p>Brief allusions to Jason's death in the comics. Nothing overly graphic, but I did want to mention it here, just to be safe.</p>
<p>EDIT: Alright! This chapter has now been revamped... the Justice League was a little too clueless, so I gave them more of a fighting chance. They're still very, very lost, but they have at least one person who actually knows Bruce's real name now.</p>

<p>Wow, okay! So, I decided to wait until I finished this whole piece before I posted it here on AO3 because I'm always sad when I find a really good fic where the author lost inspiration before they finished. I promised myself I wouldn't do that to anyone, so, there it is!</p>
<p>(Also, 8,000 words is so many more pages than I thought—before this, I didn't appreciate the authors who write really long fics nearly enough!)</p>"

<p>Tubbo, Ranboo, and Tommy started the band as a joke after a stream one day because “oh, haha, we all play instruments!” but now people actually like their songs… not that anybody actually knows the songs are theirs.</p>","<p>IMPORTANT: alrighty, so some of you may know this, some of you may not, but this fic used to have Purpled in it. However, Purpled recently stated that he actually doesn’t want irl him in fics, only his dsmp character, so I’ve rewritten the fic so that he is no longer in it. </p>
<p>I’ve simply replaced all of the chapters of the older version with the new one in the same fic so that people wouldn’t lose their bookmarks. This means that there are going to be some comments about Purpled in the comments section but he’s not actually in the fic anymore so don’t worry!</p>
<p>I’ve left the author’s notes from the original version as well (some altered to exclude purpled), but I’ve also added new notes to some chapters! The Original notes will usually come before the new ones!</p>
<p>If you notice purpled anywhere (or any other purpled related inconsistencies) please let me know so I can fix it!</p>
<p>While I am sad to see the original version go, making sure I am within everyone’s boundaries is top priority!! </p>
<p>Original Notes:<br>Hi! I don’t know where this idea came from, to be honest, but I decided I just had to write it, so here you go! </p>
<p>(For those of you who are reading my “Can’t Be Herself” series, chapter three of Destroy the Transphobes (Karl Jacobs Yells at a Transphobe) will hopefully be done soon!)</p>

Wilbur must have realized this. Right? </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAPqXkZW_I"" rel=""nofollow"">""Betty""</a> by Taylor Swift - HOWEVER, the version of the song I imagined them doing is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht1qGtiLWBc"" rel=""nofollow"">this cover</a>, by Vanadeen. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading! </p>

<p>edit 04/08/2021: BasicallySnakespere (Tadpole music) finished writing the lyrics of ""Lost and Losing"" and recorded it! You can listen to it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6085P4P8sQ"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a></p>
<p>Original Notes (edited):<br>Aah! Thank you for the amazing reception the first chapter got! I’m so happy that people like this! </p>
<p>Here’s a reminder of their aliases and instruments just in case:</p>
<p>Player One: Keys/synth, lead vocals.<br>Player Two: Bass, guitar, backing vocals<br>Player Three: Drums, some guitar, lead backing vocals</p>
<p>Important: the twitter handles and names associated witht them that I used in this chapter are all just random things I made up off the top of my head. I haven't checked to see if they actually exist and if they do those people aren't actually connected to this fic!</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s chapter two!</p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>New Notes:<br>Welcome to chapter 2. Again, if you’re confused about any changes to the fic, read the beginning notes of ch. 1!</p>
<p>Also, to clarify, Ranboo is still mainly the bassist of the band. In future, if they were to do live performances and stuff, they’d pre-record the guitar parts and they would just play them as a backing track to the rest of their instrumentalization.</p>
<p>

<p>Original Notes:<br>New Songs Mentioned This Chapter:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpWY4ck6yr4"" rel=""nofollow"">“Home”</a> by One Direction - thank you milkyumiitea for reminding me of this song</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh9NGs-W5bk"" rel=""nofollow"">“I Want”</a> by One Direction - Yes, for the One Direction fans out there, The Multiplayers did in fact change the line “different date every night” to “different dick every night” when they recorded the song.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV1lpw8cUsg"" rel=""nofollow"">“Good Kid”</a> from The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical - this musical is a masterpiece. (Chapter title inspired by this song)</p>
<p>(“Masked” is another made up song. The verse from that is written by me. Can you tell I can’t write songs yet?)</p>
<p>I feel like this chapter was a little bit slow but don’t worry, things start to pick up in chapter three! </p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>New Notes:<br>Now that I’m rewriting, I’m able to go back and analyze what I wrote. For example, this line “He’s always been a little better at improv than Tubbo,” about Tommy should be taken with a grain of salt. Tubbo is, on occasion, an unreliable narrator. It doesn’t really matter who’s better or worse!</p>
<p>Original Notes:<br>Hi! I meant to have this chapter out yesterday but it wasn’t agreeing with me. I ended up changing it a lot from what I was originally planning for the chapter but I think it works way better than it would’ve if I hadn’t changed it. </p>
<p>Sorry for the constant cliffhangers, by the way! Also, my only beta is grammarly so if you see anything please let me know!</p>

<p>Original Notes:<br>Okay a little disclaimer: I obviously don’t ship minors, and the ‘Tubbo wanting to create a romance with Player One’ thing isn’t speculation on Tubbo’s sexuality. It’s more or less the same dynamic that Tubbo and Ranboo have with their whole platonic marriage thing on the smp. Except for the fact that Tubbo is Player One which means they can’t actually be shipped together… </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa0Swz3X1cQ"" rel=""nofollow"">“Your New Boyfriend”</a> by Wilbur Soot - I figure we probably all know this one..?</p>
<p>(“I’ll Be There” is another CalistaWon original. This is probably my favourite of the ones that I’ve written? Not sure, though.)</p>
<p>The podcast and the record label are fake. I have no idea how record labels actually work so we’re just going to pretend like this is it. I figured since Wilbur doesn’t use Twitter, he wouldn’t contact them that way, and he probably wouldn’t do it in a YouTube comment. The Multiplayers don’t have a public business email, so contacting the label would seem like the best option. </p>

<p>Honestly, The Amazing Devil is probably one of my favourite bands so I just had to include them. I would really recommend checking out some of their other stuff! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PSvYqYTBI8"" rel=""nofollow"">“Farewell Wanderlust”</a> is definitely one of my favourite songs but unfortunately it just didn’t seem to work with this fic.</p>
<p>Anyway, uh, sorry for the cliffhanger?? </p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>Original Notes:<br>Oh my god I am so sorry that this chapter took so long to come out!!! I didn’t mean to leave you for so long on such a big cliffhanger! Unfortunately: university. Also, this chapter just didn’t want to cooperate at first. </p>

<p>Original Notes:<br>Hello! I feel like it’s been so long since I updated! I was going to write and post this chapter a few days ago but I got distracted writing something else (ballet!tubbo). And then yesterday I wrote trans!benchtrio. But the chapter is here now!</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve planned out the last few chapters of this fic. It’ll probably be another 2 or 3 chapters and a short epilogue.</p>
<p>Thank you again to everyone for reading and thank you for all of the kind comments! </p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>New Notes:<br>Hello. I have gotten to the point of reuploading this fic where i've decided i hate formatting. Why did i involve so many tweets in this fic??? </p>
<p>in all seriousness, though, while formatting is really difficult, i'm glad i'm doing this. it gave me a chance to go back and fix grammatical mistakes (i'm sure i've missed plenty, but still) and it's a huge relief off of my chest. the half hour between when i found out about purpled's new boundaries and when i figured out how to hide the fic without deleting so i could rewrite it, i felt so bad? i'm happy i'm fixing it!!</p>

<p>Original Notes (edited):<br>New Songs Mentioned This Chapter:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeiYxdteTQ"" rel=""nofollow"">“C’est La Vie”</a> by Weathers - This was recommended in the comments of a previous chapter by AnneOfTheDawn. I hadn’t heard of Weathers before, so thank you! Their music is great! </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"" rel=""nofollow"">“Never Gonna Give You Up”</a> by Rick Astley - Alright this one was inspired by PixiePowders’ comments! It’s not exactly what they had in mind in the comment but I liked the idea too much to ignore it so I decided I would figure out a way to include it! - also the chapter title is from this!</p>
<p>(""Flowers"" is another one that I wrote!)</p>
<p>(I want to add that I won't be able to get to everyone's song suggestions but I really appreciate them anyhow. I'll probably make another fic that's just a list of songs I think The Multiplayers would cover and how they would do it (like who sings what and stuff like that) if people are interested in that!)</p>
<p>If you’d like to know the real reasons behind the ATLA bender tweets (they aren’t very serious...) then here you go:<br>Tubbo - Fire: Nukes and other explosives.<br>Ranboo - Earth: enderman pick up grass block<br>Tommy - Air: This was the hardest yet easiest to decide on? I really don’t know how to explain it other than it feels right.<br>(I think if I was being more serious about it then these would be different but I didn't really spend a lot of time thinking about it. The only one I'm super attached to is air bender Tommy)</p>
<p>About Ranboo travelling to the UK: please don’t travel unless you have to! And if you have to stay safe! The timeline of this story is vague enough that I figured I could get away with them travelling. Stay safe everyone!</p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>New Notes:<br>Someone in the comments mentioned chickeninnit as the reasoning behind airbender tommy and i 100% agree with you.</p>
<p>Original Notes:<br>It feels like it’s been forever since I updated even though I know it’s only been a week or so. I’ve been crazy busy with university (finals have started…) so the next update might not come until next week or the week after that! Sorry!</p>
<p>Big Announcement: shayisgay (<a href=""https://twitter.com/shayishellagay"" rel=""nofollow"">@shayishellagay</a> on Twitter) made “False Niceties” (the song Ranboo/Player 2 wrote)!! You can listen to it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocu7fTp5Xlg"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE!</a> </p>
<p>I’ve also made a book that has the full lyrics to some of the songs that I wrote for this (I made it part of this series so it’s easy to find). A few people have asked to do covers, so if you want to, go ahead! Just make sure to credit me for the lyrics. Sending me a link would also be cool, so I can see it! </p>
<p>Alright, that’s everything! Enjoy the chapter!</p>

<p>Now there’s just one or two chapters (likely just one unless I have too many ideas) and an epilogue left!!</p>
<p>Small teaser for the next chapter: one of the notes I have on my ‘ideas’ doc for ch. 12 is “Wilbur does an oopsie”.</p>

<p>Original Notes:<br>I finished my first year of university AND it’s my 19th birthday (25/04) so here’s another chapter!!! It’s a short one BUT I’m going to upload another one in a couple of hours! </p>
<p>This was all originally going to be one chapter but it got really long so I split it up into this short interlude and then a longer chapter 13. </p>
<p>Hope you like it!</p>

<p>New Notes:<br>I originally posted this on my birthday? that feels like so long ago oh my god.</p>

<p>Original Notes:<br>Like I said, chapter 13 will be up within the next few hours! It’s the Big Reveal! </p>
<p>Also… new faceless singer in town? Miss Keledones is named after the singing automatons that Hephaestus made out of gold (the Keledones, sometimes spelled Celedones) in Greek mythology. They were apparently amazing singers who were potentially as good as the Muses.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>Original Notes:<br>Thank you all for the birthday wishes! As promised, here’s chapter 13!</p>
<p>This is the last chapter before the epilogue! Writing this fic has been one hell of a journey and I want to thank you all (again, I know) for commenting, leaving kudos, and even just reading this! </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>New Notes:<br>still thinking about Tommy and Ranboo doing ""The Other Side"" together. still thinking about it.</p>
<p>also ""Singleplayer"" is probably my favourite of the songs i wrote for this.</p>
<p>Original Notes:<br>This is it…</p>
<p>There’s a longer note at the end but I just wanted to say thank you again. Writing this has been so much fun and though I’m sad to see it end, I’m really happy that you guys seem to have enjoyed reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing it. </p>
<p>Here’s the epilogue.</p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>(ps: again, any twitter handles/extra names are all randomly made up off the top of my head. Some are also from an online generator)</p>
<p>New Notes:<br>I made it to the epilogue oh my god formatting takes so much time!!!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_14_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Original Notes:<br>Miss Keledones in Chapter 12 wasn’t mentioned for no reason..?</p>
<p>Okay now get ready for sappy endnotes:</p>
<p>Wow! I can’t believe this is the end! Which is why it might not be! I’m thinking about writing a sequel (though I’m not sure yet, so no promises!) I really like this world I’ve created. Writing it, writing these characters and all the shenanigans that they get themselves into, it’s honestly been so much fun. </p>
<p>So yeah, I won’t promise anything, and I really don’t want to overwrite this (if that makes sense), but I do have ideas that I wasn’t able to get around to in this book. It would be nice to write more! That being said, I do have other fics I want to write (for example, I need to finish my Broadway Ranboo fic “King of New York”) so if a sequel does happen, it might not be right away!</p>
<p>I honestly can’t thank you all enough for commenting, leaving kudos, and continuing to read every chapter! When I first started writing this, my plan was to have two or three fun little chapters about these four being a band. That… didn’t happen, but I’m so glad that you guys stuck around! </p>
<p>Lastly, I am currently setting up a Discord server. I’ve never done that before so it’s taking some time. (If anybody has any tips/suggestions, feel free to let me know!) Once it’s ready, I will possibly - temporarily? - add another chapter onto this fic that will just have the link to the Discord for those of you who want to join. Otherwise, it’ll be in my ao3 profile and i’ll probably link it on twitter and tumblr. </p>
<p>Thanks again (I know, I keep saying that)</p>
<p>-Cal</p>
<p>(tldr: Possible sequel, thank you!!!, Discord server coming soon, thank you!!!)</p>
<p>New Notes:<br>Yep | @Hen118 is my favourite OC</p>
<p>Alright, I'm going to say thank you again. Not surprising. Like I said before, while I will miss the original version of this fic, I'm not upset about having to change it. I don't want anything that goes against cc boundaries in my ao3 works. So thank you all for bearing with me while I hid the fic and reworked it. </p>
<p>Also, thank you for 100k hits! that's so cool! </p>
<p>Alright, one last thing, the 'possible sequel' i mentioned in the original notes IS happening! I'm in the process of writing it and i will hopefully begin uploading chapters soon! (don't worry, this doesn't mean i've abandoned the other works i'm currently writing! I'll still be updating those!)</p>
<p>I have a Spotify playlist! I’ll be adding all of the original songs that The Multiplayers make covers of to it as I write the story! You can find it <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dPYmR2JuwWm2vfnBIjQW1?si=6cfa5cdff6814c98"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE!</a></p>

<p>(Hitoshi, like any good friend, brainwashes Izuku’s anxiety away for a day so he can know some peace. The problem? Izuku has no fear of god or consequences.</p>
<p>Izuku also has no goddamn filter.)</p>","<p>A gift for the queen of Chaos herself, Otaku6337.</p>
<p>This was sparked by a prompt from DreamerKitten on Ota’s discord that I borrowed with permission. I did take some stuff from Dreamer's and Luna-tic's ensuing conversation because it was hilarious and they have wonderful ideas. Thank you for letting me use this prompt! I was dying laughing in the discord. </p>
<p>Originally this was going to be short, sweet, and to the point but it spiraled out of control.<br>(If I ever write anything under 1000 words, shoot me because I’m apparently a pod person) </p>
<p>Things to know: this is almost all in Hitoshi's POV. The names are a little weird but Hitoshi thinks/calls people by the names he's most comfortable using for them, even if he doesn't use that name when actually speaking about that person. </p>
<p>This could be argued as OOC for Izuku but que sera sera. </p>
<p>Also, fair warning: fans of Bakugou might not be super happy but I don't bash him (much). Then again, I don't think I've met a fan of Bakugou who doesn't want canon Deku to dunk on him a bit. Just a bit. </p>
<p>tw: one minor homophobia mention from Mineta.</p>
<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a> and <a href=""#children"">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>
<p>I wrote this during Hitoshi levels of sleep deprivation and honestly it's some of my best work comedy-wise. That being said, please excuse any errors lol. The working title for this was ""unfiltered izuku: now with 100% less anxiety!"" </p>
<p>I know Ectoplasm is canonically the math teacher but he never gets much love so I wanted him to be in this as the science teacher. We'll say Snipe is a math teacher, who knows what the hell he's usually doing. ALSO: I don't know science. </p>
<p>You ever realize how much metaphorical weight you carry with anxiety or stress? Can you imagine that weight being completely and abruptly gone even if only for a day? Your brain would make you high on serotonin and endorphins. I just wanted to make a fun little story for Ota with some sass and chaos and then I thought about how it would actually work and here we are. A semi-high non-anxious Izuku with zero filters or even impulse control, lightly sprinkled with angst and crack.</p>
<p>I'm headcanoning that Shouto ""supervises"" Hitoshi and Izuku hanging out because he doesn't quite get the whole love rival thing, and all three of them start spending a lot of time together especially during Hitoshi's insomnia episodes or Izuku's still occuring anxiety attacks (The boy gets meds and therapy but something things still happen to the poor bean). They end up all really liking spending time together. Hitoshi freaks out because he likes two people??? Him????? Shouto freaks out because he didn't know he could like the way someone naps or that he could stand to sit in silence comfortable with anyone but Izuku. Izuku freaks out because he doesn't want to ruin these friendships that he cherishes so much. lots of pining, lots of miscommunication, but they sort it out and all agree to date each other. It's very adorable. There's a lot of cat cafes and watching movies together.<br>(Also Bakugou gets therapy and Mineta gets expelled. The class is thriving *thumbs up*)</p>
<p>Again, thanks to DreamerKitten for the idea!<br>Edited 4/4/21 to get rid of those weird double spaces around the formatted words.<br>As always, feedback is appreciated! &lt;3</p>"

<p>---<br>A Cinderella story, of sorts.</p>","<p>This is primarily intended to be a fun, lighthearted, porny romp, with little to no intelligent design or thought-provoking concepts.</p>
<p>Indeed, I have tended in my later years to prefer to just compile all of my favourite fandom tropes and mash them all together into a truly self-indulgent piece. And as such, this will feel, perhaps, slightly contrived or “samey” to things you might have read before, and it will most assuredly be rife with some mischaracterizations and hand-wavey plot devices.</p>
<p>Magic, dead readers, is my modus operandi.</p>
<p>Now with a podfic recorded by the lovely and sweet MrsLucyGoosey. Please go listen to the dulcet tones of her work!</p>
<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a> and <a href=""#children"">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>
<p>I realize I left the question of the true size of Harry’s cock to be a mystery. That was mostly on purpose, as I was torn between the tongue-in-cheek concept of making it 9 and 3/4, which would be perfect, as Draco’s favourite toy is 9 inches, and is not quite the perfect fit, so that extra 3/4s of an inch might be just what the doctor ordered to get to that special place.</p>
<p>Or, there was the earlier allusion to Harry’s wand, which is 11 inches. I was originally leaning towards this as a truly monstrous size that would immediately strike fear into the hearts of all but the truest size queen, but I warred with the idea of it being ever so slightly too far fetched.</p>
<p>Think of it as a sort of... ‘Choose your own adventure.’</p>
<p>Harry, as our Hero, can be whatever your hopes and dreams are for a cock.</p>
<p>---<br>Though I feel like it shouldn't need to be said (and I was unfortunately proved wrong literally the day I am posting this work as a kind commenter alerted me to someone having plagiarized an earlier work of mine); Do NOT repost this work, edited vaguely or otherwise, either here, or on other websites.</p>
<p>I have often wondered why this was so frequently being addressed by other authors on this site, and it seems to be a very prevalent issue. Please be respectful of authors and other content creators.</p>"

<p>So what if Katsuki dropped the guy some money, and so what if he was accidentally developing a crush on the guy.<br>This was fine.<br>Its fine.<br>After all its not like the guy is gonna send Katsuki a message-<br>Oh no, is that a notification sound?</p>
<p>AU Where Izuku is quirkless and a twitch streamer and Katsuki has to keep his identity as DynaMight hidden while the two slowly develop feelings for the other</p>
<p>Clicking the stream his jaw hung he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. This fucker. Not only did he have that beautiful ocean green hair, but he has gorgeous long dark eyelashes, soft full pink lips, and freckles. Holy shit. The freckles! A beautiful plethora of constellations across his cheeks and down his neck. And wait, where are they on his arms too?! Each time the guy waved his arms around Katsuki could see some along his forearm, beautiful soft angel kisses all over. God fucking damnit.</p>
<p>Katsuki’s hands hovered over his phone's keyboard. What the fuck do you say in this kinda situation? He was never good with feelings, let alone helping people with THEIR feelings.<br>But fuck.</p>
<p>And one thing that kept pulling at him. “Maybe cause I’m qurikless?”</p>
<p>—————-<br>KaboomKing: I don’t have a mic for my PC.<br>Deku: Oh heck. Really??<br>KaboomKing: Never needed one.<br>Deku: Aww… we could call on your phone?<br>—————-</p>
<p>Fuck, he completely forgot about his phone!</p>
<p>Maybe the shit mic quality would mask his voice? And if he wasn’t yelling and just talking calmly Deku might not even realize who he is. No, this could work. This could for sure work.</p>
<p>With shaky hands, Katsuki typed out his message.</p>
<p>“Fuck…” Katsuki groaned out, staring down at his phone. This has to be illegal to be this adorable. There no fucking way a human being could look like that and be allowed to walk down the street.</p>
<p>“Ohhhhh~” Denki now had a cheshire grin. “So it's a boy!” </p>
<p>That was not what he was expecting the other blonde to say. “What?!”</p>
<p>“Y’know, it makes sense. You never were into girls back in high school. Its okay Kats, you know I’d never judge you for being gay.” Denki reached out, placing a hand onto Katsuki’s broad shoulder. </p>
<p>Error, error. Katsuki has stopped working.</p>
<p>WARNING: THIS CHAPTER COVERS TOPICS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND PHYSICAL ABUSE!<br>PLEASE BE WARNED BEFORE READING</p>
<p>“Aw, my poor kitten. You look so upset. I’m sorry, but you were trying to get away and I just couldn’t have that.” The raven haired man said gently, pushing Izuku’s curls out of his face and brushing at his soft cheeks.”You’re far too cute for me to just let you go.”</p>
<p>There was a sad reality before them both. They were both alone, but in different ways. Katsuki had chosen to be alone, and had chosen to push people away. while Izuku had been pushed away, he had no choice in this isolation. But in the end, both longed to be found, long to find someone else that could understand them in a way that no one in this society could. It was poetic, in some sad messed up way. Each wanting the other for different but all to similar reasons, two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>“Hey Kacchan, c-could you do something for me?” Izuku mumbled out, feeling his ears start to burn up.</p>
<p>“Wassup nerd?”</p>
<p>“Could you read to me until I fall asleep?”</p>
<p>“K-Kacchan…?” Izuku could barely speak, fear spiked through his entire being. He felt sick.</p>
<p>“Deku, I need you to breathe. You’re hyperventilating.”</p>
<p>“K-Kacchan he found me! He knows who I am!” Izuku rasped out.</p>
<p>DING DONG</p>
<p>the doorbell? </p>
<p>Izuku froze, staring at the entrance way to his apartment. Another ring, and Izuku slowly stood to walk towards the door. His body felt woozy, his vision going blurry as he made his way over.</p>
<p>“Wh-who is it?”</p>
<p>“So, what you’re saying is…” Katsuki could feel a toothy smile creepy across his sharp features. “I can beat this guy to a pulp.”</p>
<p>A piece to this puzzle that life dared hand them and all this time they had been desperately trying to put together but never knowing where the final piece lay.</p>
<p>It was here.</p>
<p>The piece was found.</p>
<p>“P-pretty? Me? I’m not a girl, Kacchan.”</p>
<p>“Yeah no shit Sherlock. Men can be pretty. You’ve called me pretty before.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck-CRAP! No! Ugh!!!” </p>
<p>Katsuki couldn’t help but laugh at that. “Izuku Midoriya! Was that a swear? My, what would your mother think!”</p>
<p>“Shut up, your swearing has rubbed off on me!” </p>
<p>“Me? Swearing? I don’t know what you mean! I’m an Angel! I never swear and I am always very very polite.” Katsuki coos, sarcasm dripping from his tone.</p>
<p>“Hardy harr harr.” Deku huffs, but a smile clearly on his lips. “But, you’re right.”</p>
<p>“About?”</p>
<p>“You are very pretty.”</p>","<p>Howdy howdy~! Hopefully you guys like what I have so far. Shout out to my friends Dani and Sal for proof reading this.<br>I've had this AU stuck in my head for a few weeks now and finally decided to actually write it.<br>Lemme know what you all think &lt;3</p>

<p>Hey there! Sorry for the lack of updates! I had extremely bad carpal tunnel for a few weeks and could barely draw or write, plus a ton of back pain.<br>I got a new desk and chair and that's helped a lot! So more updates soon! I'll also be making ANOTHER BKDK fic so keep an eye out for that on my socials (twitter: @RadPax, instagram Rad_Pax)<br>Happy Pride Month btw!!! Thank you all for reading my story and liking it! It means SOOO much to me! Sorry last chapter was pretty intense, but I'll be tackling more on it and hopefully do it justice.<br>Fluffy continues now after all that angst. &lt;3</p>
<p>oh hey a new chapter so soon? I was gonna wait a few days before posting it but eh.<br>I've had a pretty rough day and wanted to share this chapter really badly. Its my favorite that i've written so far so let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Sorry for the late update! I recently had to move back in with my dad (posted about the whole situation on my twitter @radpax) and got pretty depressed due to the whole thing so had 0 motivation to write and 0 ideas for the next chapters.<br>But we're back!<br>Sorry this chapter is a little shorter but the next few will be a little longer. I try to have each chapter be around 3k each, but I felt like this was a good cut off to this particular chapter. Excited for the next ones! Things are really heating up now (pun intended)</p>
<p>back so soon? Hi hello!<br>trying something new out with the art for the next few chapters. lemme know if you like it.<br>as always you can see more of my art over on @RadPax on twitter or rad_pax on IG<br>we're getting closer to the finish line i think!! exciting!<br>Let me know what you thought of this chapter! &lt;3<br>ALSO!

So let me know if you have anything you really wanna see or any questions that need answered!<br>I cannot thank you all enough for reading this and liking it. You guys are all wonderful and its been such a fun experience writing again! <br>Reminder you can follow me on twitter @RadPax or instagram Rad_Pax for more art, updates, ect.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Izuku!! This felt like the most sound ending tbh. I tried writing more and adding extra but this one just made sense.<br>Hopefully you all are satisfied with this ending~<br>Like I've said in the past, follow me on twitter (@RadPax) or twitter (Rad_Pax) for more art and when I'll post updates to my fics and new ones.<br>This has been a hell of a ride but this story is finally done.<br>To think I started this like, what? 2 months ago? And now we're here.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Some answers to some questions I'm sure you all are wondering.</p>
<p>Did katsuki explain they knew each other as kids?<br>Yes. I tried writing that scene over and over again but it clashed badly with this ending, but yes he did tell him.<br>and Izuku about melted from it. The piece was originally planned for that scene but like I said, everything I wrote just didn't seem good.</p>
<p>Is Izuku still going to nursing school?<br>Yes~! He still dreams of being a nurse even if he's dating the top hero! He wants to save lives too!</p>
<p>Is Izuku still streaming?<br>yep~ Though now from the safety of Katsuki's home ;) Aint no one getting in there</p>
<p>What about inko????<br>Well, with Katsuki's money she's been able to get better care and is doing a lot better now.</p>
<p>Is this really the ending??<br>Yeah. I didn't want to just keep writing for the hell of writing and end up getting writers block because I can't figure out where to go next.<br>I haven't written a big story like this in YEARS and there's nothing worst than writing yourself into a hole just cause you don't want to be done.<br>But don't worry~!<br>I have two fics in the works! One with Deku being trans and he owns a cafe where his old childhood bully wonders in (should be out by next week. waiting on a logo) and one about android Deku~! :&gt;<br>So please follow my twitter to get those post~</p>"

<p>Hey! I will start off by saying I wrote this after both 2 consecutive days of AP exams and my second shot of Covid vaccine. I will not be surprised if I come back and realize half of this work is incomprehensible. That is fine.</p>
<p>I was inspired to write this after binging my way through all of sircantus' works that I hadn't already read. Not sure where this one is gonna go from here, as there was zero planning, but who knows. Making it up along the way can be good sometimes too.</p>
<p>Hope you like it lol</p>

<p>There's that. Thanks for reading this first bit, no idea when I'll have another chapter because idk what's even going on right now lmao. It is bedtime for me. Sleep time.</p>
<p>You're all cool people, keeping vibing my friends</p>
<p>Hey y'all! There's already been a far greater interest in this work than I expected, so thanks for that. You guys really are suckers for SBI found family stuff, aren't you? (It's okay, I am too)</p>
<p>I don't have much to say today, except that I only have one week left of school and that means all I have to do is get through finals and I'm home free. (It also means that I lose my school laptop, but whatcha gonna do. Back to writing in the notes app of my phone lol)</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Dream, acting like a big brother to Tommy? Yes. We need more good Dream content. I hate c!Dream, but I can't help but feel bad for him after the Quackity lore, so I decided to add him in as a nice guy. Give us a bit of a break from sad Dream content, you know?</p>
<p>Hope y'all liked the chapter, I'll say again that I am currently making this up as I go, so if there's plot holes, no there isn't. I do not see</p>
<p>Have a great day! :)</p>
<p>I’ve finally done it! I’ve written another chapter for this work!</p>
<p>God, I had the worst writers block for this fic, which is really upsetting because the ending is really good but I can never seem to write the middle to things.</p>
<p>And then when I finally got around to writing, my few elite Insta followers saw that at like 1pm today, I accidentally deleted like the first nearly 1k words of this chapter and promptly lost my shit. It’s cool tho, we re-wrote it and it’s all good.</p>
<p>Anywho, enjoy! :)</p>

<p>Rivalstwt come get y’all juice-</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for sticking around for so long, sorry this took like a billion years to update.</p>
<p>Also, rest assured that I will not be abandoning this fic, ever. In typical me fashion, I went ahead and wrote like the whole like climax scene (second to last chapter) and it’s really good, so now I have to actually see this through so I can post it lmao</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EDIT: Hey a brilliant person in the comments suggested I ask for ideas for round 2 which is great because I am struggling, so if anyone has something, kindly share it in the comments thank you very much</p>
<p>So, I’m back. Sorry about the wait once again, folks. Gonna confess right now, this one is a bit of a filler chapter.</p>
<p>1) Because I needed to develop the relationships between characters more<br>2) Because I am most definitely stalling as I try to drag myself through the next challenge lmao</p>
<p>I’m glad I finally got something out tho, I have been going through it in the last week and finally writing something has helped make up for it</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Do I need to keep pittng SBI and Dream against each other? Nah. But it’s funny, so imma do it anyways.</p>
<p>Side note, here’s some life advice for you guys:</p>
<p>- Poison ivy sucks ass and does not combine well with a whacky immune system and eczema. Would not recommend. Wear shoes when walking in the woods, y’all.<br>- Any day can be redeemed by a little bit of fog at sunset, a good music album, and a large bowl of cubed water melon.</p>
<p>Now go, be free. Use my wisdom to improve your lives this instant</p>
<p>A quick summary of my week:</p>
<p>- Gets intense vigilante AU brainrot and is forced to beat it back with a proverbial broom<br>- Accidentally give myself writers block as a result of said proverbial broom<br>- Very, very tired (poison ivy meds suck)<br>- Mild mental breakdown (see previous for reason lmao)<br>- Finalized decision to never have children of my own after dealing with work</p>
<p>Big shoutout to goldhyuck for kicking my ass into gear and literally booting me out of writer block. Idk how that works but it was a damn miracle. Thanks dude</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>This was a really short update, but fear not. This was originally part of one chapter with the actual second challenge in it, but I’m like 2/3 of the way through writing and it’s already over 5k words, so I had to split it up for the sake of my own sanity.</p>
<p>I’m on a roll though, so you’ll most likely be getting either a double update today or the second half of this chapter at like 2 in the morning. We’ll have to see.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have more writing to do</p>
<p>*Aggressively slams this down on the table before grinning at y’all and promptly passing out*</p>
<p>I wrote entire thing within about 24 hours. It’s literally half the length of the rest of the fic I- I don’t understand. How. H o w.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for all the suggestions, they really helped me figure out what the hell to write. Anyways, enjoy your middle of the night update</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Fun fact: the whole pendant-puzzle-thing (and literally half to content of this chapter) is actually from a dream I had like, years ago. But it fit the theme so... <em>ta da</em>. Wild stuff right there</p>
<p>I hope y’all didn’t get to attached to Quinn, he’s gonna show up like once after this lmao, I just needed a partner for Tommy. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and like 1700 kudos. I kinda just blinked and it was there, but seriously. Y’all are the best :)</p>
<p>Me: I don’t really have plans for this OC, he’s kinda just a plot device-</p>
<p>Literally all of you in the comments: Quinn is now my favorite, I will die for him</p>
<p>By popular demand, it seems, I’ve decided to try to fit him into a few more scenes. Did not expect him to be such a hit, but alright- you win. I surrender.</p>
<p>Here’s just some funny and cute bits to break up the time between rounds- please enjoy :)</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Look- it’s cute.</p>
<p>Not sure what kinda drugs I am currently on that’s allowing me to write this much in so little time, but hey. More updates for you. </p>
<p>I’m gonna keep riding this momentum as long as I can, but do not be surprised if it suddenly takes me another week to get the next chapter out. Next chapter is the start of the final round, and action scenes are hard for no good reason, man</p>
<p>The Vibes™️ as of late:</p>
<p>Me: You know, I haven’t watched the lore streams in like a month or more, I think my hyper fixation is finally ending. I’m just not as attached to the characters as I used to be</p>
<p>Also Me: Sees 1 (one) singular tiktok in which all the dsmp characters get happy endings and promptly bursts into tears</p>
<p>Still Me: Stays up until 4:22 am reading fanfics again, spends free time the next day working on my own</p>
<p>Yep, definitely over this fandom. Totally.</p>
<p>Anyways, here y’all go- it’s a little messy and the pacing is kinda funky, so I’m not <em>super</em> happy with it, but whatever. I simply do not care anymore. Take it. Begone.</p>
<p>

<p>Next chapter is my favorite next chapter is my favorite next chapter is my favorite next chapter is my fa-</p>
<p>Also sorry for the lack of like, actual fight scenes in this one. I was gonna write all three of Tommy’s individual rounds but the next chapter is also a massive fight scene and honestly, I’m lazy. They’re so hard for no reason, but I tried. Sorry.<br>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>You guys crack me up, you really do. The comments on last chapter? Immaculate.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see your reactions to this one. I simply cannot wait.</p>

<p>Here’s a little fun fact for you all- I wrote this entire chapter (minus the fight scene) before I even wrote chapter two. Do with that information what you will.</p>
<p>Now, to sit back and let the chaos unfold.</p>
<p>See y’all later lmao</p>
<p>Edit (because there seems to be a little confusion):</p>
<p>PSA: DREAM IS NOT DEAD. MANS IS JUST PASSED OUT. THAT IS ALL</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Would you look at that. We’re at the end already.</p>
<p>I just wanna say thank you so much for all the kudos and comments on this work, I didn’t mention it nearly enough. I even saw some people rec this on TikTok? Like, what? I love you guys so much, just thank you for all the support. It catches me off guard every time.</p>
<p>This chapter might be a little sloppy, it’s currently 3:21 am right now and I wrote half of this in one go. But I’m gonna be traveling all over for the next like 6 days, so I was trying to get this done before that.</p>
<p>Enjoy the ending, my friends :)</p>

<p>I’m gonna try to start a new work soon, but I’ve got school starting in like a month and a shit ton of college apps stuff to do, and it’s a long work (extensive plot woo), so that may have to go on the back burner for a bit. </p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to come to over to Instagram, it’s linked in my profile bio, I’m planning a post when I get back from travels if anyone wants to check it out, or just chat or something.</p>
<p>Until next time, yeah? </p>

And anyone in their right mind would be afraid, would be shitting their pants, but Tommy just flicks his eyes to the floor and mumbles that it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Echo hums softly, brushing his fingers gently over the bruises coloring Tommy’s cheek, stopping at the gash over his eyebrow before carding through his hair. Tommy doesn’t mean to lean into the touch, he knows these men are dangerous, are deadly, but he can’t help but feel safe, wrapped up in their brutal care.<br></p>
<p>It’s pathetic, really, how quickly frustrated tears well up and spill over, how easily Tommy crumbles.</p>
<p>The place where the villain holds his wrists burns and when he tugs, ever so gently, Tommy falls into him. Something in him aches and shatters and maybe, maybe heals, just slightly.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, kid,” the Blood God murmurs into his hair as Tommy sobs. “You’re okay.”</p>
<p>They were never going to be able to keep this up, not really. No matter how much they fought, no matter how secret they kept their identities, someone was always going to find the connection, exploit the weakness in the previously invulnerable armor.</p>
<p>The Syndicate had a fourth—a too-skinny hero with a loud mouth and a distinct lack of self preservation instincts. No one wants to fuck with the Syndicate, with their expensive suits and high tech gear. Plenty of people are willing to fuck with Tommy though, Tommy in his ratty old red hoodie and ripped up jeans.</p>

<p>School, life, and work got busy so I wasn't able to respond to all of your lovely comments but know that I did read them all and they were the main reason you got a second chapter. I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed writing it! Spooky Izuku for the win!!! Ｏ(≧∇≦)Ｏ</p>

Tomathy Innit is a 16 year old boy who struggles to juggle between keeping his family's cafe afloat, with said family gone, and his secret life as a vigilante while he takes care of these heroes and villains that keeps passing out at his doorstep.</p>
<p>Seriously, where are these people coming from?</p>

<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#children"">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>
<p>AN: In everyone else's POV, they would refer to Tommy as an adult because 1)he acts like he's older and more mature as well as the added height he has, still doesn't stop him from causing mischief and 2)he owns his family's fucking cafe. Because really, who would expect an 16 year old to effectively run a cafe?</p>
<p>Explanation on Tommy's Powers</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<p>-He can create illusions using mist from either his surroundings or released from his own body<br>-The illusions usually can phase through any solid but can solidify if more mist is used<br>-He can either project the illusions to make weapons, obstacles, etc or cover himself in it so that he can disguise himself or just go invisible</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>-He needs to actually SEE when he uses the illusions so that he can form what he wants to make<br>-If he were to use the mists extracted from his body for a long period of time, he can risk getting frost bites, or in a more severe case, hypothermia</p>

<p>Anyways, this is basically a character study of Arthur Pendragon. He is my favorite character and I truly enjoyed exploring everything about him.</p>
<p>Thanks goes to tofs (and the other users) who commented on “Laundry’s Hard Work” and started my mind rolling on this idea.</p>
<p>I give a ton of credit to my friend, Tessa, who brain stormed with me and essentially gave me the idea for the entirety of this fic. Acknowledgement also goes to Mat who put up with our squealing and (after Tessa and I stopped squealing) gave some great ideas of his own.</p>

How have they never discovered the kid until now? I mean, Iron Man has always been good at keeping secrets, but a whole CHILD?</p>
<p>Rhodey could trace the shock residually plastered through every crease and curve of the other man’s face. Natasha still had a particularly pensive expression, sure, but Clint was floored. He looked like he had a concussion.</p>
<p>Maybe he did. Maybe that was a side effect of finding Tony Stark asleep on the couch <em>next to a kid</em>.</p>
<p>“He’s yours, isn’t he?” Rhodey asked quietly. “Your son.”</p>
<p>Tony opened and closed his mouth. Like a fish. “No?”</p>
<p>Clint leant forward to end the recording, but now that Tony was finished talking the quiet ‘beep!’ the phone made was highly audible.</p>
<p>“Oops,” he whispered, and quickly sent the video off to the Rogue Avengers’ group chat, with the caption, ‘Proof Stark has a son’.</p>
<p>Sam flew through something sticky and flailed around in the air for a second before righting himself. “What was that?” he spluttered. He recognised the feeling, but; “a spiderweb? What the fuck?”</p>
<p>The door to the lab slid mechanically open, to reveal a genius-billionaire-playboy-pilanthropist-<em>possibly-dad</em> according to the team’s conspiracy theories; and a slender, surprised-faced teen with brown curls standing awkwardly half-behind him.</p>
<p>Maybe it was better that the Rogues didn’t sit in on this particular board meeting.</p>
<p>At least it wasn’t as bad as the time he jumped onto the ceiling by accident because his pencil had rolled to the very edge of the table and the back of his neck felt like a bomb was about to go off.</p>

I took a few classic tropes (Peter meets the Avengers, Field Trip to Stark Industries, Everyone Thinks Peter and Tony are related) and just rolled them together with a massive bundle of fluff. And added a slight twist, which is that the Avengers think [censored due to spoilers] [sorry not sorry!]<br>There'll be ten chapters, but they won't be posted regularly.</p>
<p>Argh I can't believe how mentally exhausting it is to write ""candy"" every time instead of ""lolly""... American spelling is driving me nuts. Sorry, guys, you might end up with a weird mix of ""colour"" but then ""candy""... If there's something blaringly not-American let me know.</p>
<p>In case anybody was wondering about the whole mammoth milk thing in the last chapter (I know I was) both mammoths and elephants actually do produce milk. However, its toxic to humans, so no giant buckets of mammoth-milk carried around by little cave-men. And no mammoth cheese.</p>
<p>Sadly.</p>
<p>Many, many, endless thanks to everybody who enjoyed the first chapter of this story (and everybody who didn't enjoy too, I guess)! Your feedback and kudos meant so much to me!!</p>
<p>Hi! It's been a while!</p>
<p>Here's some sleepy-confused-and-a-bit-irritated Tony. And some Peter, too.</p>
<p>I'm back in lockdown; going through online learning number 2, and I've got one thing to say. Not. Fun.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've been meaning to finished this chapter for aaages but my computer was confiscated twice and then my notepad went through the wash, so there's that.</p>
<p>Many thanks to everybody who reads, comments, leaves kudos, and bookmarks, have a wonderful day; and please stay covid-safe!! Wear a mask!!</p>
<p>So, I've been asked to update... and I have! (Suprise!)</p>
<p>Aaaah, hello!! It's been a little longer than I'd hoped... I lost my planning sheet for about the fifth time but I can mostly still remember what happens so I'm just going to roll with it. I'm a bit of a disaster sometimes so idk.</p>
<p>A million thanks to everybody who is leaving kudos, bookmarks, comments... you guys are amazing and I absolutely, 100% wouldn't have the motivation to do this without you, you're pretty much the only reason this fic is alive in the first place!! I can't say thank you enough!!</p>
<p>I've discovered that wanting to write and actually writing are too very different things. Sadly. But. I will promise that I will have the next chapter done and up by... well, how about before the weekend?</p>
<p>(PS Also, Bucky's whole character did a 180 and just... I'm sorry. I couldn't fix it; and it didn't want to be fixed.)</p>
<p>THERE IS AN ART. SOUND THE ALARM. SKBRIFUEDKJN PLEASE GO CHECK IT OUT <a href=""https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/fluffyartbl0g/674346754376974336"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE!</a> ITS REALLY REALLY AWESOME AND THe person who made it is spectacular and i love them, you can check them out on tumblr @fluffyartbl0g and hand on my deepest respects</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>oH nO... nAt'S cLoSiNg iN!!!!<br>Sorry, Bruce, but she's literally the only person on the team with a braincell at the moment.</p>
<p>(Sorry for the enormous delay! I really truly am sorry! Plus I hate this chapter it was a bitch to write and I didn't edit or read through at all so if you find mistakes please correct me in the comments!)</p>
<p>Hello all you wonderful people!<br>Now, I'm sorry for going slightly AWOL during the holidays, I promise it's not permanent!! &lt;3 Not sure when the next chapter will arrive but I have no intention of deserting this fic so rest in peace etc. I love all your comments and kudos, they make my day!! Thank you!!</p>
<p>PS I'd also like to extend a formal apology to the absence of Wanda, Vision, Thor, and the whole concept of canon. My eyes are suddenly open to the many painful holes in this fic, so if you're actually enjoying this, you get extra credit. I don't know what's happening with my brain at all.</p>
<p>Happy New Year's Eve!</p>
<p>I'd first like to make it quite clear to everyone who commented and left kudos that this chapter is dedicated to you. I wrote it for you and it belongs entirely, to you.</p>
<p>Secondly, I'd like to explain away my absence as being the fault of Merlin and Good Omens (I love them both very much) which led my wandering feet very far from this work at times.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day, and if you've been waiting for this chapter, I applaud you for your patience.</p>
<p><strike>*rocks up three months late with a multiverse plot*</strike> sssh what are you talking about</p>
<p>So I started watching the Mandalorian and then I wrote like, half a chapter of this and half a chapter of that other series and half a chapter of something else entirely before I started thinking about how many fic plots I have written down in total and BOOM! This fic is gonna be part of a series which will, eventually, join a Multiverse. </p>
<p>Also, I started this chapter like, ""I don't ship Stucky that much!"" and then, rereading this chapter.... uhh....</p>
<p>nkjrefhdwkjn ive got a hundred and one things to do and of course i choose to do this ugh</p>
<p>sorry for the very long delay i got bored. it happens sometimes. thankfully this is the last chapter so you dont have to worry about that happening again! in other words, thanks for coming on this journey. as something i started purely to get myself comfortable 1. being in a fandom outside of my head, 2. fumbling my way into things i liked and finding things i didn't like, and 3. posting online; this fic took off much more than i thought it would, so thanks to the <em>five and a half thousand</em> people who left kudos (holy shit there's so many of you)</p>
<p>this last chapter, as always, is for you. </p>
<p>ps. i gave up on american spelling, im not sorry.</p>"

<p>As someone who has taught both 4th and 5th grade AND has spent years teaching dance classes of 20 or so 6-to-8-year-old girls with tap shoes on... thoughts and prayers are welcomed SLKJFKLSJFLKD anyways that is to say that the mannerisms and dialogue of a 7yo girl are deeply embedded into my brain so JK's daughter has personality and she's hilarious (to my sense of humor, anyways, but I digress). IMPORTANT TO NOTE that I have never taught in a Korean school, so everything is just researched to the best of my ability with some creative liberties.</p>

See chapter index and notes for each one.</p>","<p>So, this one shot is a ‘what if’ scenario based off of Dark Matter, diverging from the main fic around after chapter 16. If you’ve read up to chapter 16, you’re good to go on this one. This is one of those ‘What If’ scenarios I kept mentioning in the comments. This one had to be cut because it causes quite a few plot holes in the main story line, but I liked it enough to keep it around as a separate thing. There are a few identity reveal ideas I had that ultimately didn't fit the main plot.</p>
<p>Obviously, this first one has spoilers for the fic up to Chapter 16.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_1_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>This was completed before I realized it caused a massive plot hole later on while also complicating the story beyond my ability to compensate, so it had to be cut. I still liked a few scenes and figured some of you might, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, the next chapter is on a brief hold until I fully hammer out the plot holes I found.</p>
<p>Spoilers for Dark Matter up to chapter 16. Note that this hasn't been edited much/at all, so there might be continuity snags and plot holes.</p>
<p>I can’t believe people have this one bookmarked, but here, have a Peter/Felicia flavored version of the Parent Teacher Conference.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I have, no joke, four other versions of the Parent Teacher Conference alone. One with Sam stepping in as Peter’s ‘parent’ for the night. One where Peter is hit full blast with the fear toxin. Etc. That’s not getting into the next main divergence point in the story: chapter 19. There are four other versions of that, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, Felicia has grown on me the more I write her, and I liked this version enough, so maybe a few others will, too.</p>
<p>Again, spoilers for Chapter 16. This one almost made the final cut.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>The funniest part about all of this is that the Parent/Teacher conference wasn't even in any of my previous drafts. I tossed in a throwaway line and realized I needed to address it. That's partly why there's so many different versions.</p>
<p>Again, Chapter 16 spoilers.</p>
<p>I found the original one shot, but it is in ROUGH shape. It'll take time to clean up and I'd rather focus on other things first.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_4_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>This ended the story too soon so it didn't happen. It was pretty good practice for crawling back inside Tony's head though.</p>
<p>No spoilers for this one. This was one of the alternate versions of the original Dark Matter draft, written mostly as a thought experiment/warm up.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>There are a few more chapters of this, but I ultimately decided to go a different direction. Truth be told, I forgot I had this until I started digging through my documents folder and found it and a bunch of other one shots I've never bothered to upload.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>Spoilers for up to chapter 31. Here's a scrapped identity reveal that I had to remove. It just doesn't work for the latter half of the story I have in mind. </p>
<p>As a warning, it's only half edited and has a few plot holes.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_6_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>The mind control one is still on the menu, but it's going to be reworked and likely posted under its own fic eventually. It got a bit more involved.</p>
<p>This is a scene I had written out that doesn't work with the plot I ultimately went with. No spoilers; it's just extraneous nonsense that worked more as a writing warm up than an actual plot.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>There's a few other no spoiler cut scenes I'll toss up eventually. Hope you enjoyed it!</p>
<p>Got a few requests for alternate POVs for this chapter, here's the first! It's a bit more 'crack AU POV' than the others.</p>
<p>Spoilers for chapter 41!</p>"

<p>before u read this fic, y'all should know it's based off of another fic called Dark Matter by mysterycyclone, aka the fic that got me into Batman in the first place. and i'm so glad it did bc i actually joined the fandom right when the batman harley quinn show gate was happening on twitter and that was the most serotonin i've literally ever received in my LIFE. I did get the ok from the author to publish these fics tho don't worry!!</p>
<p>if u don't read that fic (although u rlly should, it's a VERY good fic,) then all u need to know to understand it is that after peter got snapped in infinity war, he woke up in the DCU, and he's been barely scraping along alone in Crime Alley, and he decided to be Spider-Man in specifically the alley. i take a few creative liberties and also there are some differences because Dark Matter is still updating and i write off my theories/headcanons, but it's still heavily influenced by the fic so show the author some love!</p>

<p>~ spiders in my head! spiders in my mind! ~</p>
<p>i have been on a writing KICK lately so we'll see how this fucking works out!!!!! literally i've written like 200 pages in the past some week it's insane. also ik some of batman was ooc probably but also i could not care less i'm so sorry i just don't this fic was dredged up from somewhere VERY deep inside of me.</p>
<p>anyway i'm a slut for kudos and comments, please leave them!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 i have a lot more peter parker and batman crack where this came from, and i might post those too! and knowing y'alls thoughts would help me. make that decision. some of those are. significantly longer than this. i just thought this might be easiest to start posting bc it's a lot lighter lmao</p>
<p>all of peter's spider behaviours are either real science facts or lifted straight from canon. the bonus scene was a play on Spiders-MAn, that What If story about Peter Parker being devoured by an army of spiders who absorb his conscioussness (wtf). ethyl chloride is spidey's kryptonite in the comics, and he has canonically pretended to raise an army of spiders or eat criminals during interrogations before. i researched sm about spiders for this fic. i'm arachnophobic. i'm having nightmares.</p>
<p>reminder that if u liked this then there’s also the sequel :))</p>
<p>ETA 12/04/2023 lmao i edit all my fics after they're posted. sometimes just little grammar things, sometimes adding whole new scenes &lt;3 this one i added a few more lines just to show peter's progression into being a little bitch.</p>"

<p>So, what did you think? I hope it was worth the wait!<br>...and speaking of waits, I'd just like to warn you guys that the next update *might* take a bit longer to post. My work is having its biggest sale of the year this week, so I've been a little overbooked, and next week I'm going away for a few days with family, so I likely won't have time to write. I hope this makes up for the delay!</p>

<p>Credit for this story idea goes to my dear sister, my first reader.</p>
<p>I didn’t put this story in my <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/series/2223669"" rel=""nofollow"">Dad for One series</a> because I deliberately left it ambiguous if All for One is Hisashi Midoriya or not. Personally, I think it’s hilarious either way for different reasons. In the Not Dad for One AU, All for One launches his fake bomb of evidence at the same time that Izuku develops Black Whip. People see a boy with All Might’s quirk and multiple quirks and completely believe that he must be the test tube baby of All Might and All for One. Izuku goes on a troll rampage in retaliation, and by the time the dust clears there are enough conspiracy theories to make Shouto Todoroki weep from joy.</p>
<p>In the Dad for One AU, All of One can’t convince anyone that he’s Hisashi Midoriya. The Hero Public Safety Commission already released a statement saying that All for One is Izuku’s father and then released another statement taking it back. They’re not going to change their minds again—it would make them look too foolish. The story has been entrenched in the public’s mind as notorious fake news. No one will ever be able to convince Izuku of it because he’ll always believe that All for One is just trolling him back.</p>
<p>The critical difference between these AUs is a matter of timing. Dad for One tried to keep Izuku’s relationship to him secret until the right time to prevent him from being taken hostage. The non-related All for One could care less so he spews out his fake story immediately. Ironically, this results in people only believing All for One is Izuku’s father in the AU where he isn’t. Izuku, of course, doesn’t believe it whether it’s true or not. That was Izuku’s lie first and he’s very miffed at All for One for trying to steal it.</p>
<p>I had no plans to continue this fic, but it won a poll on my tumblr (<a href=""https://www.tumblr.com/aimportantdragoncollector"" rel=""nofollow"">aimportantdragoncollector</a>) for which of my oneshots should get a chapter two. I’m grateful to everyone who loves this cracky story. I refuse to answer any questions about why a oneshots series now has a second chapter. I also refuse to answer any questions about the timeline, this takes place in crackverse.</p>

<p>Fanfiction is a fun way to explore new things and so I've done something new (to me) with the story and it's told from different points of view. Each chapter title will name the POV character.

<p>Hey guys! Sorry for how long it took me to post this. I had so much trouble writing this final chapter, and I literally had to rewrite the ending several times, and eventually, I had to scrap almost twenty pages! The reason being; I changed my mind about how I wanted the story to end halfway through the editing stage. Originally, the story was going to end with Wilbur waking up and realizing that all of it was a dream and he never really went back in time and Tommy was still dead. The story ends with Wilbur calling Phil and Techno and meeting them both at Tommy's grave where they all grieve for Tommy together as a family for the first time since the funeral. <em>However</em>, I decided that ending was too sad and it didn't give Tommy the chance he deserved, so I scrapped it and rewrote the final chapter with a new ending, that is a bit happier than the last. </p>
<p>That being said, AO3 is being a little finicky for me right now and I was forced to split the final chapter up into two chapters. So, the second half of this chapter should be posted after Thanksgiving (or for those of you who don't celebrate the holiday) around the end of the weekend. </p>
<p>I hope you all enjoyed this chapter, and thank you all for the lovely comments you've given me, they really inspire me to write! :) &lt;3</p>

<p>Finally finished with this, wow. This one was really hard to write so I hope you enjoyed it. The ending might let down some people but I felt like it was the only way to end the story. Realistically, Tommy wasn't going to heal in one week. No matter how badly they wanted to, they would never be able to magically fix years of neglect through one week. In the end, choosing what was best for Tommy was the only option. The original ending that I had planned for this book is still written, though, so let me know if any of you would be interested in reading it, I might publish it, too. </p>
<p>As for Dream... maybe he sent them back, maybe he didn't... the ending is a bit ambiguous, so that's completely up to you. </p>
<p>That's all for this book, though, so for those of you who stuck around since the very beginning, thank you for reading and waiting for the updates! I hope all of you enjoyed this book! &lt;3</p>
<p>Wow. This chapter was honestly so hard to write. This entire chapter was just so heartbreaking, but I think what made it so difficult to write was how Tommy viewed his suicide. Tommy is just so young and naive, he didn't really understand the permanence of killing himself. He saw it more as moving in with his mom who separated from his dad, and less like <em>killing himself</em>. Honestly, the whole chapter had me in tears.</p>
<p>As for Phil, Wilbur and Techno... Yeah. Their actions may seem irredeemable, but I'm going to shove redemption down their throats because TOMMY DESERVED BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading, I really hope you enjoyed this! If you liked it, please leave a comment and a kudos, they really help me out! :)</p>"

<p>Jason's references:<br>-Johnny Appleseed is an American historical-figure-turned-folktale who wandered the early US on foot and planted over a million apple trees in his lifetime.<br>-A Newbery Medal is awarded to outstanding children's literature, and often favors books that deal with profound childhood tragedy and the loss of innocence.<br>-Benny Alden is youngest of The Boxcar Children, a children's book series about child detectives. They are orphans, and spent their first adventure living by themselves in an abandoned boxcar, hence the name and why Jason brings it up.<br>-Dorothy Ann is the resident bookworm from the Magic School Bus series.<br>-Encyclopedia Brown is a boy detective.<br>I like the idea that Jason has no idea how old Tim is, and is skewing younger and younger in his references (bc Robins are born to quip) but Tim gets absolutely none of it bc he straight up doesn't read for fun and never has (at least not fiction). </p>

<p>Oh man! This was so fun. I'm happy times one million that you guys have enjoyed it too. You are great. Thank you so much for all your comments, kudos, recs, and twitter screaming.</p>
<p>Okay. Here is The Plan As It Stands So Far:</p>
<p>1. I need to take a little break to write some original fiction.</p>
<p>2. There will be one more one-shot. It's partially written, but it requires some tinkering because I want it to be SO GOOD. It deserves to be the best little one-shot it can possibly be.</p>
<p>3. Then: The Big Sequel. If you have been thinking ""gosh, there isn't very much Steve in this thing"" or ""where the heck is all the Sam,"" : they are in The Big One. Plenty of Olds and Cat Eleanor too, along with Many Feels and some pretty bad times inside Barnes's head. Team-Building Exercises sort of winds around the outside of that one, so, er, I guess I've given away the whole plot. Oops!</p>

<p>The fact that no one ever notices that Bakugou is going through stuff really upsets me tbh. Also I headcanon that when he is super upset, he either go silent or explodes, no in-between.</p>

<p>AH!! This has been the chapter I have been waiting for! This was the original idea that got me writing this fic. I was sitting there one day and went ""What if Aizawa never knew that Bakugou had been muzzled, and he found it later after angst from Shinsou and Bakugou?""

<p>Alfred would scoff at the statement, about how Bruce was trying to justify the whole situation to himself. It had started out as a simple design, black everything with black outlines and black hood. It got a little more intense as the world went on, got wind of his ghost on the streets, and became scared of The Bat . So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward- </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead:</p>
<p>“ The Batman can fly, you know, I’ve seen his wings.” </p>

<p>me, to myself: ""im a fuckin idiot""</p>
<p>hello everyone, i've hiked the Appalachian trail, got home, became obsessed with DC and superbats, and now I'm trying my best to write things again. Made this monster and I hope you like it. I apologize for anybody who wanted straight up wingfic- i have failed both you and myself- but i wanted to write a 'fake' wingfic and i think i got close enough for goverment work so</p>

<p>At one point, I was going to write a sex scene between them where Bilbo would be like, ""Oh Thorin,"" and Thorin would be like, ""Oh....you,"" which probably would have toppled this over to the 15k word mark to get all the set up in there. Cutting that wasn't a length thing so much as some fics just demand to be weird ambiguous friendship love platonic romance things, but feel free to imagine that scene tacked on to the end of the Laketown section. </p>

<p>No, scratch that—Tim is <em>great</em> at galas. He’s been attending them ever since the age of three, when his parents first stuffed him into his little Gymboree tuxedo and gave him a stern lecture about ‘sitting quietly’ and ‘speaking when spoken to.’ He knows all the rules: what to wear, how to stand, when to smile, what to say, what not to say.

<p>The NyQuil bit was taken directly from my friend's experience growing up, except her parents only did it for long car rides. They'd pile all the kids in the backseat, then give them each a shot of ""Traveling Juice"" before taking off. They'd sleep through the ride with minimal squabbling and wake up at their destination.</p>
<p>She just thought everyone did this with their kids. It wasn't until she was in college and got a cold and tried NyQuil for the ""first time"" that she realized what <em> Traveling Juice </em> was all along 😬<br>---</p>
<p><b>EDIT:</b> I've gotten quite a few comments wondering how the Drakes' landline phone could have worked during a power outage, so I just wanted to take a second to address that!</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question62.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">How Stuff Works</a>, it takes very little power to complete a phone call (only about 6-12 volts at about 30 milliamps). Depending on your phone service provider, it's quite common for them to have backup generators which can supply enough power through the underground copper telephone wires—separate from the main power line—to complete a call, provided that the telephone is a <em>corded</em> device. Wireless devices will not work without power (or, if they use a rechargeable battery, at least will not work for very long).</p>
<p>Now I certainly can't speak for <em>every</em> phone company, but this was true of the one that serviced my family growing up, so hopefully that shows it's at least <em>plausible</em> that the Drakes' phone could have worked during a power outage? So in this one instance, Janet <em>does</em> actually have a point and isn't just being a bitch (though arguments could certainly be made about how the heck she expects Tim to carry out her instructions while tethered via a 10 foot spiral cord to the kitchen wall)</p>
<p><b>EDIT #2 (because this line will truly be the death of me)</b> : Okay, apparently all of the above information WAS true, up until the last decade or so when the majority of phone providers switched over to VoIP. This means you have to have an internet connection in order to place a landline call, which you can't have without power to the router, so modern landlines are useless in a power outage. Janet still believes what she believes from her own childhood experiences. Whether she's right and Tim could have used the hardwired phone, or whether Gotham has modernized their landline technology yet is up for interpretation. I could definitely see the city opting out, since their power grid goes down like every other week with the latest rogue attack lmao</p>

The Weeping Angels are aliens that disguise themselves as statues and can only move when you aren’t looking at them, like turning your back or blinking. They kill you by sending you back in time and letting you live out your life in the past, and feed off the years you would have lived in the future. The Doctor is a centuries old time travelling alien who “regenerates” and shifts faces instead of dying. The Doctor mentioned in this fic is the 10th Doctor played by David Tennant and his companion is Rose, whom the 9th and 10th Doctors were in love with. They had a bit of a tragic love story that ended kind of happily. Torchwood was an agency started by Queen Victoria to monitor alien activity (The Doctor, specifically) and UNIT is also an agency that deals with aliens in the Doctor Who universe. Everything Eggsy remembers happening are things alien related that happened to London in Doctor Who during his lifetime that he thus would have remembered. And that’s all you need to know about Doctor Who for this fic, though it is a great show and I do recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi!</p>

<p>A/N: So yeah, time travel shenanigans. This ship is like a black hole of AUs, and I am getting sucked into it hard. The Doctor Who stuff is just contained to this chapter - it’s more a plot device than a true crossover. But, to come in part 2 - pining!Eggsy thinking Harry is straight, pining!Harry thinking Eggsy is with Lancelot, resolution and bendy young people sex, and then some good old fix it fun with Gazelle and Lee Unwin. You’ll also probably note that I’m writing Eggsy differently than I normally do - this is deliberate, as I’m trying to play up that whole Eggsy is the mature agent one and Harry is the younger, less sure one. And yes, his fake name is Ward because that's Julia Robert's character's last name in Pretty Woman, because I do intend to beat that one reference into the ground. Again, tumblr is a horrible place full of enablers with prompts, and I am weak. Enjoy as always, and comments feed the muse.</p>

<p>A/N: So pleased people are enjoying this little AU! I originally was going to have this chapter and the next one be one chapter, but this got longer than expected, and real life demanded more time, so I figured I try to get this part out at least. The downside is that it’s going to be a good while before I have time to write again - I’ve got another super fun medical school exam coming up, and then an actually super fun trip to Europe for 9 days (wheeee!) after that, so we’re looking at three weeks at the shortest before the final part is up, and my apologies for that. But, it’ll have Lee, Gazelle and it will be fix-it fluffy, so at least there is that! Also, yeah, if you find you have developed diabetes after reading this, I take no legal responsibility ;) So, as always enjoy, and comments feed the muse.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>A/N: So yeah, the delay on this is kind of inexcusable, but I do sort of have valid reason in the form of a health crisis where one of the three possible diagnosis they were going to give me for what I had was cancer, and that sort of...wasn’t conductive to creativity. I don’t have cancer, thank goodness, though I do have a chronic illness that I’m starting to be able to manage now, which isn’t exactly ideal, but a lot better than the alternative!! So yeah, that was the state of my life the last few months, and just add med school and you get very little writing done! But I feel a bit better, and I’m finally on my break, so I’m going to try and get my unfinished fics done at least, and a million thank you’s and apologies for the wait and for everyone who stuck around with this fic for much longer than I had intended!</p>
<p>Also I got a lot of comments about people worried this chapter was going to hurt, and I have to ask; what part of my ridiculous fix-it fervour for this pairing made you think that? ;) Seriously, the movie is angst enough for this pairing - fix-it is for fluff, as I always say, and I hope I’ve delivered on that in this fic :) So, as always comments make the world go round, and I hope you enjoyed the fic!</p>"

<p>I just edited it and honestly I forgot what I'd written because I'm so deeply invested in writing the field-trip part rn. </p>

<p>I was really tempted to end this with Peter smiling at the reporters, looking at Tony and looking back into the camera and just going, “I am Spiderman” as a nice harker back to Iron Man, but I decided against it, and went for the cringest ending ever that basically links back to the first line of the fic where its like Peter is the only one who has no idea he’s the heir. Lame, anyways onto the thank yous.</p>
<p>Honestly I really thought I’d make this fic three chapters and it would have been probably 15k words MAXIMUM because I really only write one shots, but this has been awesome to write and I hope you all have enjoyed it! I will be doing a series of Peter &amp; Tony related one-shots soon so be sure to have a look at those and also potentially another project if I have time (exam year /neg). Again, thank you for all the love on this fic, I seriously really appreciate it &lt;3</p>
<p>edit: the series of oneshots i mentioned is in reference to the ‘heir peter’ universe created from this initial work and is in a series that is linked below this end note. there’s about 20 works of bamf peter that i wrote last year, don’t take the timeline too seriously and enjoy &lt;3</p>"

<p>For this next part, I think it's 100 times funnier if you remember that: <br>a) the boys are trying to protect Batman himself from death threats &amp; kidnapping attempts, and are really only there for plausible deniability <br>b) Clark is absolutely furious with Bruce's lack of security and can't do shit about it, because Superman doesn't know Bruce Wayne, and Bruce wants to keep it that way <br>c) only Bruce and Clark know this</p>
<p>Last chapter! Thanks for sticking with it, folks. Hoping to maybe do more with this 'verse soon.</p>
<p>Another fun reminder:<br>a) Clark can hear everything they're saying outside the massage room<br>b) Bruce can't<br>c) none of what they said really registers with him until he's home later</p>

<p>Foggy’s middle name is known in canon to start with ‘P’, but no one knows what it is. I chose Philip, partly it’s a fun name and partly because of Saint Philip Neri. St. Philip is known as the patron saint of joy, humor, and Special Forces. Matt most definitely counts as a special force.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, Matt gets pretty active at the end of this story. He should probably be lying completely still and knocked out on pain meds, but he's Matt Effing Murdock and he can do what he wants. He seems pretty good at grinning and bearing it anyway, and Foggy offers a lot of grinning potential. And I feel like Matt knows how to move carefully so that he doesn't hurt himself more (he's had a lot of practice), and Foggy will probably be mother henning him the whole time, no matter how into it he gets. But if that bothers you (which I would totally understand), you can either: pretend the end takes place after a time skip, where Matt's healed; or, pretend Matt has a healing factor. I sort of think he does, sometimes.</p>

<p>btw, if the duffer brothers kill either of my boys i will be living in this universe i created and there's nothing anyone can do to stop me</p>
<p>btw wanted to say thank u to the person who reminded me Steve actually did admit to smoking weed in season 3! for the purposes of the story we're gonna pretend he didn't say that lmao, and that this is his first time. </p>
<p>also thank u for all the kind comments! if i don't respond know that i still read them all and appreciate every one! and even if ur not commenting, i appreciate u taking the time to read! </p>
<p>also, also-- i've written essentially all of this to basically the same Wallows EP on repeat (except for the first chapter, which i wrote to my oldie's playlist lol.) Wallows obviously isn't a band from the 80's, but their Remote EP really captures the ~vibes~ of this fic. or at least, it does to me, and maybe u! figured i'd throw it out there. </p>
<p>anyway, hope u enjoy! little bit longer of a chapter than usual :)</p>
<p>heyyy. so first off, i know the 'see something say something' campaign didn't happen until 2001, but lets pretend it existed before then in this universe, bc it was funny-ish and i said so. </p>
<p>secondly, i have good news and bad news. the good news? this will be my first ever finished fic! the bad news? There's only two more chapters left, and one is an epilogue. im actually rlly sad to be drawing this fic to a close, i feel like i could write in it forever, but i love this fic a lot and wanna do it the justice of giving it a proper ending. as of right now, and maybe im biased bc it's my first ever finished fic, it's my favorite fic ever written, and im honestly not sure if i'll do better than this. but thats ok! to create something that not only i enjoy so much, but that a lot of yall did too is something pretty spectacular! </p>
<p>thirdly, i have the inkling of an idea for another steddie fic. probably shorter than this, similar concept but not set in the same universe as this fic. it would be from eddie's pov, and while their dynamic would be similar, it would be tweaked just a bit to explore different sides of their characters that i didn't really lean into in this one. (ie, eddie's shyer side, and steve's more confident jock one.) and there would probably be more angst. honestly this is the first fic i've written with barely-- if any-- angst.<br>so if that sounds like somethin ur interested in, keep an eye out after this fic is done :D</p>
<p>thank u again for all the wonderful comments and support! as of right now we're at roughly 800 kudos with a bit over 6000 hits, which is absolutely insane to think that many people laid eyes on something i made-- and a good amount liked it! thats crazy, even tho it might not be a lot to some ppl, actually trying to fathom that many ppl reading something i wrote is... practically not possible haha. so thank u again!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_8_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>this was the final chapter, but don't worry! there's an epilogue coming probably tomorrow. it will likely be a little shorter than the other chapters, however.</p>
<p>i'll say more on the actual final update on this fic, but for now, thank yall so much for supporting, no matter what way u did! the day of posting this we broke a little over a thousand kudos, and thats pretty wild! and ofc, thank u all for the super nice comments, yall are too sweet. seriously, some of u really supersized my ego haha. even if i didn't respond i read all of them, and they meant a lot!<br>i hope u enjoyed the last full length update!</p>
<p>main edit: the angsty Eddie POV fic is out btw! it's called 'Keep it Steady, Eddie.' Once more for clarification; it is NOT a continuation of this fic, or an alternate POV to this fic</p>
<p>little edit: i've gotten a few ppl asking if they can draw fanart so i just wanted to say absolutely! pls give credit to the fic if u dont mind, but other than that draw to ur hearts content! and if ur comfortable, drop a comment with where to find it so I-- and anyone else who enjoyed the fic-- can see it! i'd love to see what yall come up with :D</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_9_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>and that's the end! thank yall so much for all of your support and sharing your thoughts on the story so far. i wrote the first few chapters of this as a character study just to see if i could match their vibes, and didn't think i was gonna post it at all. but im so glad i did! yall have made writing this story somethin really special, &amp; i cant thank you enough! </p>
<p>if you're interested in a slightly angsty eddie-pov fic, i'll likely be starting it soon after this one. to be clear: it wont be a continuation of this fic, and will be completely unconnected to this one. a fresh start so i can explore different sides of their characters, basically.<br>but until then, i hope you enjoyed this fic, and a little epilogue where we got some wholesome group-dynamic content.<br>thanks again :) &lt;3</p>"

<p>Something in Steve shifts at this. The protective part of his personality gets flipped on like a switch and his mind starts racing to find a solution. He remembers the sleepless nights he had after his first encounter, and how the only reason he started to be able to sleep again was to go to where things had happened one-by-one. To confirm to himself that it was gone. And sure, swimming to the bottom of Lover’s Lake isn’t very plausible, but Steve has another idea.</p>
<p>“Do you trust me?” Steve asks. Eddie nods. “Then follow me.”</p>
<p>""Steve… are you alright?"" She asks, concern lacing her voice. He must look worse than he thought. There is a long pause as she makes her way behind the desk to sit in the chair next to him. She’s frowning and giving him a look that she usually reserves for serious moments.</p>
<p>He takes a stuttering deep breath, ""I don't know - I think I'm having, like, a crisis or something.""</p>
<p>“What was that?” Dustin asks. He’s got this look on his face, something like giddy incredulity. He puts his fork back down into the bowl.</p>
<p>“I dunno what you’re talking about,” Steve brushes off. He sits back down on the couch and tries to bite back any expression that would give him away.</p>
<p>“I think he’s talking about the fact that Eddie just kissed you,” Lucas adds. Steve coughs, caught off guard.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Dustin confirms, “<em>that</em>,” he agrees.</p>","<p>Steve Harrington and Eddie Munson do something so evil to my queer rural small town America brain. Happy Pride!</p>

It's just so hard to write angst when I'm having THIS MUCH FUN playing with my shiny new toys. On that note: Hello glorious new fandom! I brought you a present! ♥</p>
<p>Acknowledgements: Huge thanks to my betas, zephre and pyrrhical who busted their asses getting this beta'd for me on short notice so I could post before it inevitably gets Jossed next week. You guys are amazing! Any remaining mistakes are mine and probably the result of rushing to post.</p>"

<p>Steve's wounds are infected. Eddie's the only one who knows how to heal him.

<p>Finally a small warning before we begin: there are mentions of the AIDS crisis - these are rather abstract, and have little to no relationship with queerness in the story. Still, though, I understand that this topic is heavy and I want you to know that it's touched on.</p>
<p>ask and ye shall receive.</p>
<p>also notice the fic name change! i wanted to keep using lyrics from the song so i decided to change the name to the song itself. ""chelsea"" in my mind is a steddie song not because they'd relate to it (thank god) but because steve would be a phoebe bridgers fan and eddie would tolerate it because it's about sid and nancy.</p>

<p>okay i hope y'all liked it! let me know if you guys want another part with our boys being stupid in their feels and maybe possibly a ronance chapter or somethin? idk. tell me all the thoughts on this one because i live on validation. love you guys!</p>
<p>SO a few notes: this is a bit of a filler because i did not intend for this to be more than a one shot and WOW was i scrambling for material but we're bridging the gap to some incredibly angsty and gooey romance shit so just... indulge me one more time with this little eddie and robin being pals segue.</p>
<p>little historical note - ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was a huge player in turning the tide of the AIDS crisis. they advocated for increased research and access to approved medicine, as well as changes to legislation and public policies to support people with aids. (they also still exist!) at the time this fic technically takes place, ACT UP had yet to be founded. that being said, i've heard a lot of people finding that there's very little discussion about and education on ACT UP in younger queer circles, so i wanted to include the detail of eddie's handmade patch for a little callback. please ignore my blatant disrespect for timelines.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>so do you want nancy and robin's side of things first or steve and eddie's? let me know!!!</p>
<p>so... ronance came first. But never fear I literally wrote the steddie chapter at the same time so that will be posted within... twenty minutes. And I expect hype on both of them, thank you. (she said sarcastically)</p>
<p>if these chapters need editing my apologies, i'm driving out to d.c. for the march for our lives tomorrow and wanted to get these up!</p>

<p>there. after having to explain how gay these two are in a wafflehouse the other day, i finally got it down on paper. tell me what you want to see next because this is four chapter past its due date but its still a preemptive fix-it fic and unlike the duffers i'm here for fan service.</p>
<p>N E WAY i gotta be up in three hours so leave me some comments to read when i get up :)</p>
<p>yo the f slur is in here but in a ""eddie uses it about himself and no one else and not in a negative way"" bc we reclaim that shit thanks.</p>
<p>everything else tho is roughly PG-13 relationship fluff because I can and I will and ur honor I love my boys.</p>
<p>ALSO ALSO ALSO</p>
<p>fluffy note at the end i just needed to put that bit in first :)</p>

<p>istg i'm convinced some of you are bots because you're all too damn sweet. literally, everyone who's said stuff about how this is your favorite steddie fic and stuff - ur cruel liars but also keep it up bc at least it's motivating me to write more!</p>
<p>and if u aren't boldly lying and have hollywood connections... dear duffer brothers let me work on your show with you pls i would absolutely die if you did and i have a resume ready to go for you.</p>
<p>all far-fetched dreams aside i really appreciate all of your comments and i get so excited when i see them. thank you all so much.</p>
<p>we're slowly navigating back to some plot. y'all comments r too sweet, n i love you all very dearly. i also apologize because i've seen a bunch of cute steddie trope lists on tumblr but not a single goddamn one of them has been in this entire fic and that's just disappointing!!!</p>
<p>also if you haven't noticed, i'm going in a poorly focused POV cycle of Eddie, Steve, Robin, Nancy. i may edit later to change some of the ronance chapter names because chelsea is a very steddie song and i feel like ICU fits ronance a lot better. and i'm on tumblr and insta and can drop those handles if you are perhaps interested. i feel like there was something else i was supposed to say but i don't remember ahhhh so enjoy this shit</p>

</p>
<p>oh that's what i was supposed to say: karen's out of character. oh well.</p>
<p>alright i am debating if i end this before the big final supernatural fight or not. would y'all rather see something just based on eddie's relationship with the law rn or something that involves Vecna? let me know!</p>
<p>also in this chapter i totally talk about season two like i remember season two well enough to talk about it. whoops.</p>
<p>penultimate chapter i think! but don't worry i'm gonna tie everything up nicely here n then i'm working on a new college AU for the fruity four that will include similar amounts of fluff and angst bc i can't help myself. stick around here a little longer and i'll probably post a preview for some of the upcoming content :)</p>
<p>n e way here's some massive wish fulfillment that a couple of you called! and a bit of historical inaccuracies (AZT trials would've most likely started quite a bit after Eddie's mom died, but still we're going with it.) Enjoy!</p>
<p>this is it babes. the last little update. the last ride. thank you for all coming on this weird and not at all planned journey with me, and i hope you have a bit more angst in you.</p>
<p>stick around for the end for a tiny sneak peak of my newest fic, a modern college AU with too much angst to function. i'm obsessed with it and i hope you will be too.</p>

I hope you enjoy it!</p>","<p>Hello...Welcome. This is what happened when an interesting character detail that I observed turned into a funny idea for a scene, and then that snowballed into basically a full-blown romance novel.

Sex scenes will be in this, but I make no promises about them being any good. I only promise that they will contain jokes. I hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Please look up the cover of Accept’s Balls to the Wall. The Accept pin on Eddie’s vest is one of the pieces of evidence on my mental “Eddie is Gay” conspiracy theory bulletin board, along with the black bandana, the handcuffs in his room, and various other things. I have connected the dots.</p>
<p>Hi, hello. So. Bad news first, always: I am having some computer trouble. I'm currently posting this at work, but I am pushing the limits of what I could be caught posting and not lose my job. The next chapter would DEFINITELY get me fired (this is actually the good news.) Anyway, I have everything in google drive, so the worst case scenario would be that I am unable to post as early in the day as I have been. So if you don't spot the update in the morning tomorrow, don't worry! It is still coming; it just might have to be in the evening, after work, when I can borrow someone's computer.</p>

<p>For anyone not familiar, the movie they watched is Pink Flamingos. It’s an interesting experience. The fact that they were still in the mood to make out after watching it is a testament to their attraction to each other.</p>
<p>My computer...she is struggling. But here I am. For you. I am very nervous about posting this, so please be kind and gentle to me. Remember that I never promised that the sex scenes in this would be hot, only that they would have jokes. Personally, I think I delivered on that part at least.</p>
<p>Thank you again for all the comments, and all the support on the last chapter! I have definitely been nervous about posting this in general, but especially that last one (and future ones such as chapter...10? Just to tease you all a bit.) Everyone's support has assuaged some of that anxiety and also made me so, so happy. I hope you like this chapter as well! It was one of my favorites to write.</p>
<p>Hi all! I have been overwhelmed (in the best of ways) by the response to this fic. Thank you so much for all of your comments. I am replying to as many as I can, but there are definitely some slipping through the cracks. I also might have accidentally replied to some multiple times because I forgot that I already replied to them. Oops! </p>
<p>Quick update on my progress with this fic: It is complete through chapter 11. All of the other chapters that I have planned are partially written. So, I will definitely be finishing this, but the updates might slow down a bit after chapter 11. I will spend some time this weekend trying to get myself caught up so that I am still able to post every day, but it might be a few more days between updates after Chapter 11. Currently I have 15 chapters and a short epilogue planned, but I may end up splitting them in different ways or adding things. I don't think it will be less than that. </p>
<p>Thank you again for your comments and love!</p>
<p>It's way too early in the morning for me to be posting content like this. I am blushing. I hope you enjoy, whatever your time zone.</p>
<p>There is a mention of Indianapolis in this chapter. I have no idea how far it is from Hawkins because Hawkins is not real and there is no consensus on what part of Indiana it’s in. Let’s just assume it’s kind of out of the way but not crazy far. It isn’t that important, honestly.</p>
<p>I struggled so hard to give Vickie a personality. I am sorry she’s so bland; the writers really gave me NOTHING to work with. Robin is always a joy to write though, so I hope you like the chapter! Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>So, this is the last chapter I am finished with. All other chapters are partially written, and I have basically every scene planned, so don't worry. This WILL be finished. I am just at the end of my daily posting streak. I am also determined to get this finished and posted before Vol. 2 comes out and ruins it...</p>
<p>Would you all be interested in reading more related to this fic, or unrelated Steddie stuff, even if Vol 2 puts all of it firmly in the AU category? I have some ideas of what I might want to write next. I will definitely need a break after finishing this one, but we probably have at least 2 years until Season 5 comes out, so we will need something to entertain us in the meantime! Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>Just wanted to give a warning that this chapter will include discussions of past child abuse and trauma. Take care of yourselves!</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for reading! We are officially at the end of the line! I'm sorry the last chapter is such a short one, but I didn't want to pad it out just for the sake of length. I feel like I said what I wanted to say, and here we are at the end! Tomorrow I'm going to be posting a very brief epilogue, which is just a short scene that popped into my head that I had to put out there. Thanks to everyone for your support, your lovely comments, and your continued readership! I love you all!</p>
<p>This is just a very brief scene that popped into my head, taking place some indeterminate amount of months in the future. If I decide to write a sequel to this fic, I reserve the right to retcon this epilogue out of existence.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_17_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has read and commented on this! I can’t believe how much attention it has gotten and I’m so glad that so many people enjoyed it. I have some thoughts about possibly writing something else in this universe. The idea I have in mind would be starting shortly after this one ends (after chapter 16, hence possibly scrapping the epilogue,) but from Eddie’s perspective this time. I have not fleshed the idea out enough to actually commit to writing it, but I hope I'll be able to! I also have other fic ideas, and some non-fanfic writing projects I want to devote some time to, so I’m not sure when I will be posting something next! I am anticipating Volume 2 of Season 4 will break my heart, so I might need some time to recover from that! Thanks again, everyone. I’ll see you in the next one!</p>
<p>Edited to add on 7/20/22: Yes, volume 2 did break my heart but it won't stop me from writing more Steddie. Also, I made a tumblr specifically for talking about my fanfic and related topics, so please go follow me! ao3soidade.tumblr.com</p>"

<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)</p>
<p>Updates every two weeks! If I finish a chapter early, I'll post it early. </p>
<p>6 Chapters, unless I change my mind.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_2_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I read the comics, but please don't point out inaccuracies. This is fiction based on fiction, let's go easy on me. I get to make stuff up if I want to. </p>
<p>Just to be clear. I think there's a lot of love in the Batfamily. And I'm writing this so I'm going to have them make up. Also, almost everything Tim hears here he takes out of context, and not in the way that his family meant it. That doesn't mean it didn't hurt him, though. And that is something they'll have to work through.</p>
<p>So I added two more chapters bc I have truly no idea how long this will be but I knew halfway through writing this chapter, that it would probably be longer than 6.</p>
<p>Also, I edited chapters 1 and 2. Nothing really changed, but now there are commas in the correct spaces and the Grammar is better so you are welcome.</p>
<p>And just fair warning, I make a very stupid and dumb dick joke near the beginning of the fic and it is not good writing, but I genuinely loved making it, so it stays in.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Thanks for all the feedback everyone. It means a lot.</p>
<p>This chapter is shorter than the rest because it's really just one scene. I'm also not used to writing for those characters so this was very new for me. I just had the idea for the scene and needed to get it out, so here! Have an interlude before the next chapter of Batfamily Shenanigans.</p>
<p>Started writing it. Had a break-down. Bon appétit. </p>
<p>In all seriousness though during this chapter I had the realization the the story was going to be much longer than I originally thought. So I had to re-outline the entire thing and refocus on what I wanted to say with it. It took me a while, but I think I'm finally happy with the direction I'm heading in. Thanks for being patient.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_5_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Next Up! Dick and Tim chapter featuring the Batgirls. Maybe other characters too, who knows.</p>
<p>In honor of 1000+ kudos, here's the next chapter a week early. I'm literally blown away by the reaction. Thanks so much, everyone.</p>
<p>This is late! But also apparently writing Superman is really hard and sucks a lot for me, so I'll take what I can get. These characters are new to me, and I'm not used to their voices, so here you go. Bone Apple Tea.</p>
<p>Hi y’all it’s been a while haha. Anyway the explanation is that between now and the last time I posted I went from a recent college grad with no jobs to a recent college grad with TWO jobs, and I’ve been traveling for one of them. Anyway, I’m still writing, just not as fast. Also I’m still traveling so this chapter ISNT quite as polished as I’m used to putting out, but I’ll edit it when I get off my flight.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_9_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>My goal to mash every trope I possibly can into one medium sized fic is going fairly well if I do say so myself. Do I do it because it makes sense? No. Do I do it because I think it’s funny? Yes.</p>
<p>Warning. Violence. Depictions of Violence. Descriptions of Graphic Injury. Creepy behavior by Ra’s Al Ghul. A bad memory Tim has with Bruce from being Robin. This chapter took a long time for me to write bc it was hard for me to get into the mindset of what I wanted to say. And also those two jobs turned into 3, I’m WORKING. Not as happy with it as I’d like, but she gets the job done, and I’m not publishing a masterpiece so I settled. Thanks everyone for the response, I really didn’t expect this much interaction and I appreciate all of you immensely. I promise I’m finishing this, it’ll just take a little longer than I originally thought.</p>
<p>hi, again.</p>

<p>Hey guys. So this is the end of SSR.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's not the end of that world, though. With that said, I'm going on a bit of a break for work. Gotta earn money and plan out a couple of fics that I want to take the time to write. One of which I'm really excited for and directly ties into SRR.</p>
<p>In other news you can definitely still contact me on Tumblr, at https://mediacircuspod.tumblr.com</p>
<p>I have something really cool going on there right now for my Batfamily fanart. You should definitely check it out if you were a fan of my fic.</p>
<p>Also I guess I should drop my tumblr, so u can speak to me and stuff. It’s not dedicated to Batman, and I share the account with my sister, but it’s where I am!</p>

</p>
<p>some fun facts about this fic! </p>
<p>- steve goes through around a little more than two years worth of loops (or around 236 loops, taking in account The Longest Loop), and the reason why his scars and injuries are appearing now, is because the loop is dying, and steve gets to live normally :)</p>
<p>- my favourite moments of the fic were the “I want to graduate” speech in “THE FUNERAL”, el asking steve what the flatlining sound means in “THE LONGEST LOOP PT. I”, and hopper validating steve’s trauma in “EPILOGUE”</p>
<p>- i use the phrase “owl-blind in early sun” which is from one of my favourite poems about a child learning the horrors of death and life after trying to shoot an owl</p>
<p>- there are a few references to loops that i didn’t write, but steve still experienced, with one of the most brutal being two different loops where the gate is closed on steve’s body as he’s climbing out of it, the same happening to eddie a different time</p>
<p>- eddie has no dialogue lines in three chapters (“THE LONGEST LOOP PT.I”, “LOSS AND LOVE”, and “DIFFERENT”)</p>
<p>- i wrote a lot of the things in the chapters in the wrong order, and mix and matched them until i liked the way they flowed </p>
<p>- the dot point summary for the epilogue was 2,258 words, making it longer than some chapters</p>
<p>- nearly all of the chapters were written one day before (or finished on!) the day they were posted. for “EPILOGUE” i read through the comments again, and included some of the things people wanted to see :DD</p>
<p>- i thought of all the chapter names before some things that actually ended up being in the chapters themselves (for example: “THE FUNERAL” originally was ONLY the three different times steve experienced eddie’s funeral. i added the breaks in between them to add more of, well, eddie himself, because it felt important. which then spirally into the “i want to graduate” speech!)</p>
<p>- the longest chapter was 10,140 words, being “EPILOGUE”, and the shortest was “THE FUNERAL” with 2,162 words</p>
<p>- the most used words and phrases were:<br>- steve (820)<br>- eddie (385)<br>- time (165)<br>- robin (163)<br>- die/dies/died/dying/death/deaths/dead (137)<br>- hand/hands (131)<br>- upside down (46)<br>- pool/water (45)</p>
<p>i hope you enjoyed this wild, wild ride! many tears were shed from my end (and from what i’ve read in the comments, from your guys’ end too). i might end up doing a companion fic that explores other character’s povs, but you’ve all been such amazing readers, so i wanted to say THANK YOU! </p>
<p>i’d love to hear what your favourite parts or chapters were, and if there was something you wanted to see me write in the future!</p>
<p>edit to add: i'm planning on writing a couple companion fics to this one later in the year!! (some to do with the aftermath of this story itself, for some well needed rest, and the other to do with the loops that steve 'left behind', for more angst ;))</p>
<p>edit edit: this story can be read as a standalone, but if you want more angst (AKA: exploring people remembering steve's deaths and his parents!), onto the next work you go!</p>"

<p>*Personal Note: The author of this guide is a swimmer, and giggles every time she uses her Triswim body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. The explicit purpose of such products is to remove all traces of the chlorine scent from the skin. The author purchases Triswim products at a store named Omega Sports.

<p>I want to thank everyone who has helped me with bits of this Primer over the last two years. Conversations about population, about assbabies, about history and plausibility. Plus a lot of fixing of my highly dubious punctuation.</p>
<p>In particular I’d like to thank Seperis, who started this off, AzureLunatic who built a lot of it, and my science expert who genuinely wants nothing to do with A/B/O universes, but loves world building and real!biology anyway.</p>
<p>I would also like to give a shout out to the Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics bookmark at AO3, which has let me follow the adventures of the A/B/O people of many worlds, not just my primary fandoms. Every one of the authors there is awesome and has given me something to think about.</p>
<p>And finally, I want to than the anons over at Fail_FandomAnon who kept me up to date on the spread of A/B/O across fandoms. They also invented both Dogfuck Rapeworld and Mantisfuck Consentworld and as such have me forever in their debt.</p>
<p>And finally, finally: Two links for further reading and world building</p>

<p>I had planned to do one big final chapter but decided to split it in two and post this part now rather than keep you waiting. I have about half of the next bit ready to go so fingers crossed the final chapter shouldn't be too far away.</p>
<p>There were way too many characters to keep track of in this scene lol. I wrote the whole thing then realised I had forgotten people and had to go back and add them.</p>
<p>I have no idea if my descriptions of powers are accurate. Just loosely going by what Wikipedia says and whatever fits the story.</p>

<p>Sorry to anyone who's comments I didn't respond to. Sometimes I'm just not in the right headspace to reply and then suddenly it's a month later and I think, well if I respond now it will be weird.</p>

<p>I'm just totally wowed by the positive response this story has gotten! Thank you all so much! It makes me so giddy seeing all of the wonderful comments, and the kudos... all the kudos. </p>
<p>I've got most of the story outlined, so no worries that this beaut won't get finished. And I've even got fever dreams of a sequel <em>and</em> a prequel. Because I <em>need</em> more things on my plate. Of course I do.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to publish chapters at least bi-weekly, though that might slow down a little in July, as I'm traveling overseas and probably won't have too much time to write things. </p>
<p>Till then, I'll hope to steadily be updating. Thanks again for the strong support!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>This is coming out quicker and quicker, I think. I'm hoping to get it all out before I go abroad and will be pretty much incommunicado for a whole month. On the downside, I've really really got stuck on a sequel for this (which is annoying since I haven't even got the original out in its entirety yet) so that probably won't come out till august???? Or later?<br>Eeeeither way, I hope you enjoy this installment (do the kids still use that phrasing? Why do I have no idea what's happening in popular thingies) *cough cough* I've gotten out of control.<br>Here you go!</p>

<p>You guys are literally the most sweetest of all people ever. Your comments give me life, and your kudos... well the swell my already too-big head, so... yeah. Thanks though, you're all awesome!</p>
<p>I have recently had no time to do anything fun. I wrote this chapter as quick as I possibly could, because I had to read Dracula, which was 160k words of period-acceptable sexism and really cliched (can it be cliched if it was the originator of the cliche?) vampire plot points. I should also point out that despite these things it was a fun book. I recommend, like 7/10. I enjoyed it, though it <em>was</em> for school, and so, while necessary, completely soul-destroying, as I read the whole thing in like, 2 days. </p>
<p>I know, I know, I could have done it in 1, but then I would have collapsed from exhaustion... and one of those days was Fathers Day so I had to... you know... interact with my father...</p>
<p>Shhhh! I'm an adult, I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again, and I hope this Chapter was up to par!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Oh My God! I am so, so, so sorry about the wait on this. I honestly had this chapter (short as it is, and I'd like to apologize for that too) written days ago. But then I was doing last-minute packing, and then I was on a plane for hours and then I was in an airport, and then I was on another plane for even longer, and then I got here and I am so low on sleep that I have no idea what to do. </p>
<p>So....here's this thing. </p>
<p>And it's shorter than I'd like as well, :( but here this is. Because Wifi here is spotty at best, and I'm not only doing schooling but also in the most Amazing London (my first time overseas, I'm excited beyond measure) I might not have time to update as much as I'd like, let alone write as much as I like. Things might slooooow doooown, but I'm going to try to get the next chapter up fast to make up for this mini one.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all of your awesome kudos and comments,</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Hello again, I hope the wait hasn't prematurely killed any of you off. I've somehow got all of this written besides visiting seemingly everywhere in this beautiful city, and a few places outside of it, and all with doing massive amounts of homework as well (yay school!). Do you know, I popped by both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, and I didn't meet the Queen either time? I think it's ridiculous. And I've seen the crown jewels and totally did not steal them, I don't even know what you are talking about right now, you are a crazy person, what? And Big Ben, and Parliament, and both the London Bridge and the London Tower Bridge and the Queen's Gallery, and Kew Gardens, and my feet have asked me politely if I would please just leave them alone for the rest of my life. </p>
<p>I actually finished writing this chapter just now in a bit of a funk, because despite all of the cool things I've been seeing, homework is still a thing, and yet others in my class disagree, and we just got a mass email from our teacher pretty much saying ""You suck, class is cancelled until you can get your shit together. I am seriously disappointed in all of you. Etc. Etc."" So I felt super bad, and as a result the ending of the chapter is... something?</p>
<p>Either way, enough about me. I know who you're really here for. </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>It has been a long time, my friends. I'm talking years, here, and I hope this is suffice for such a long wait. I think I'm getting close to the end here, and so there'll only be few more chapters. And then an angst-ridden wait for me to figure out how to begin a sequel.<br>Cheers!</p>
<p>

<p>Ahhh, so I think that after this there's only going to be one more chapter. I've got it kind of mapped out, and as much as I'd like to prolong your suffering--I mean this story, I think that is going to be it. Until the sequel...</p>
<p>Anyway, till then, cheers!</p>
<p>So guys, this is it for this one. It took a bit longer than usual because plane rides from England to US are long and I died inside.</p>
<p>And for you guys expecting Logon to show up...I am so sorry. You're going to be so disappointed D:</p>

<p>How'd you like it? Not too bad, I hope.<br>Well no worries, I've got a sequel in the works, and have even got it all kind of planned out on the back of an Olive Garden napkin, so there's that...<br>It's a coming, that's all that's important, right?<br>Don't hurt me.</p>

<p>Due to an overwhelming amount of support, this story will be continuing! I'm at one of the most busiest times of my year, so updates will be sparse until around the end of October. If there's anything in particular you'd like to see, feel free to comment!</p>
<p>I'm warning you now, there will be discussions of canonical child death and grief. Nothing too explicit, but still part of the chapter. You have been forewarned.</p>

<p>I really appreciated seeing all the things you guys commented last time! I touched on a lot of the things some of you wanted to see, but some parts were kind of short. Fear not! There is more to come. Comment on things you want to see in the future, and I'll do my best to fit it in. Disclaimer, no Anger Management in this story. We're sticking to platonic feels in this one!</p>

<p>Hi. It's been two months. Writer's block killed me, so the Superboy chapter has been delayed. In it's place, a slightly shorter chapter as an interlude. Jason now knows! He knew about Danny being Phantom but not Billy being Marvel, as Billy wasn't ready to tell him. Now there's another addition to the ones in the know! And welcome to the new year everyone. New year, same me though. This was based off my own experience in therapy, so I hope it felt like it worked like it does for me.</p>
<p>The long awaited chapter, the introduction of Kon and Elle! I broke this into two parts. Part two is mostly written so should come out pretty soon. Be on the look out for that!</p>
<p>Me: I have most of the chapter written, so the next chapter should be coming soon!<br>Writer's Block:<br>Me:<br>Writer's Block:<br>Me:<br>*Three Weeks Later*<br>Me:...Fuck.</p>
<p>So, this took way longer than I wanted, but it's here now! Whoo!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_7_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Next up, expect to see some Danny-Billy bonding time, as someone suggested. I appreciate every single comment left here, each one makes my day! Feel free to comment what you'd like to see in future chapters, I do consider each comment/suggestion left.</p>
<p>So. Life has kicked my ass. School, musical, upcoming graduation (so close, so fucking close, almost there) have all eaten my free time and will power. My preferred update ""schedule"" is at least once a month, and I missed last month's and almost this one too. But here it is! Danny and Billy bonding at last.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_8_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Graduation is impending. HOPEFULLY I can get something out in May, but given that musical showdates (finally), finals (ew), and graduation (pleasesocloseholyfuckplease) are all impending, it might not happen. However, next up in planning! A mini arc! Ghost King Danny, Crime Lord Jason, and one Champion of Magic who does not need a babysitter, thank-you-very-much. Should be about three chapters. Build up, climax, aftermath. As always, every singly comment and suggestion is seen and appreciated! How a lovely *squints* 1AM.</p>
<p>After three months I am back! I have graduated, had time to recuperate, and worked on this chapter over the course of the summer so far. This is a part one of three. And welcome to our first outsider POV, hope y'all like it.<br>Going to throw out some chapter warnings for this one. Drug mentions and overdose mentions talked about in the past tense.<br>Hope you enjoy the chapter!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_9_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>In the end, Jason went with a white shirt for his suit. If anyone would be willing to draw Billy and Jason in their matching outfits, I would cry. You can find me @lirabuswavi on Tumblr. As always, comments and kudos are appreciated. Thank you for reading!</p>
<p>*Huff, wheeze* Am I- *gasp* late?<br>I'm back from the dead! Or writers block, whichever comes first. Of course the block was only for this story, and I wrote two different one-shots in the time I've been gone (feel free to check them out, one's Miraculous Ladybug and DP, the other's DP and Transformers: Rescue Bots). And also of course once the block was gone I wrote this chapter in two days. Go figure.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_10_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Next up! Some more Ghost King Danny, a new POV, and someone knows more about Captain Marvel and Phantom than they're supposed to...<br>Fun Fact! Most spirits born of something without human involvement use it/its pronouns. Like the Leshen, they don't subscribe to the societally enforced binary of humans.<br>Second Fun Fact! There was a scene in this inspired by one of @doodlesforfics drawings for this story! Check it out in the Works Inspired for this story, or on their Tumblr.<br>As always, I love comments and kudos. Feel free to tell me what kind of things you'd like to see more of in the future. Have a great day, and I hope you enjoyed this chapter!</p>
<p>Hello hello! A little over one month later, and I'm back! This is the last part of the Three Strikes arc, I hope y'all liked it. And a new POV is entering the ring! Wonder how much the resident telepath knows.</p>
<p>Chapter warning! None, I think. If you think there's something I need to add, put it in the comments and I'll fix it.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_11_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And that's that! I hope y'all liked it. Up next, I make good on my threats of angst, hurt, and comfort! Danny has a bad time, so it's a good thing his family is there to catch him when he falls.</p>
<p>If you like my writing, then check out some of my other works! I have a Miraculous Ladybug x Danny Phantom crossover oneshot, as well as a Danny Phantom x Transformers Rescue Bots series with over 31,000 words so far. Please check them out.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and have an awesome day!</p>
<p>Back again! Perhaps less angst than I promised, and more comfort instead, but I hope you enjoy anyways!<br>Chapter warnings: Some casual mentions of death (canon), rejection by biological parents, and not read through before posting.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_12_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And there we have it: I am officially all out of ideas. Tell me what you'd like to see next in the comments. Hope you enjoyed this chapter! See you in the new year!<br>Bonus: whose order do you think is whose?</p>
<p>Hey there! I'm alive! And updating on my birthday! I really loved seeing all of the suggestions you guys gave, but then one that stuck was, drumroll please... Sam and Poison Ivy! Man, that was a lot of exclamation marks in a row. Anyways, there's not content warnings for this chapter, beyond the regular cursing, which you should really know about and expect at this point.<br>Please check out the end notes for some important updates on the future of this fic.<br>I hope you enjoy this chapter!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_13_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And there we have it! I hope you enjoyed.<br>Now, to get a little bit more serious. I really didn't mean to take this long to update, but a lot of IRL shit happened, none of it good. But in that time, it gave me the opportunity to think about where exactly I'm going with the various stories I've got going on. And the conclusion for this one was, no matter how much I love it on a personal level, I'm just not particularly motivated to write for it.<br>Who's Old Now? is my baby. It's my most popular story, with the most chapters, and the first multi chap that I've ever written. I love it, but I don't feel motivated to write for it. I'm a firm believer that you can tell when a writer loves what they're writing, and I just haven't been feeling that.<br>There is now a firm chapter count. There isn't an end date, because I don't know how long it'll take to write, but this story is coming to a close. The plan is a birthday chapter for Billy and three chapters for The Reveal. One of the most popular suggestions last chapter was The Reveal, but The Reveal was always supposed to be the end point. And, well, we're getting there.<br>This story will be finished, even if it takes me months and months. Hell, if I die IRL I'll possess my computer, just to finish it. I won't leave you hanging. You're all such fantastic readers, and I enjoy every single comment I get, even if I don't reply to most of them (curse you anxiety!).<br>While Who's Old Now? is winding down, I'm still writing in other areas. Check out my other works to see what I'm up to; there's more than one other Danny Phantom crossover.<br>I'll see you back for the future chapters, hopefully. Hope you have a great day!</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, I sure hope nothing goes wrong! Well, nothing does in this chapter. Next chapter? No promises.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_14_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Hope you liked this quick little slice of life. I don't know when the next chapter will be out, but it will come eventually. I hope you have an awesome day, and if you like my writing, check out some of the other stories I've done. See you next chapter!</p>
<p>It's here~. We made it! The reveal! We're slowly getting towards the end. I hope you enjoy this chapter!</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_15_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>And that's that! Next chapter's the fallout, and the one after that is the ending/epilogue! I hope y'all enjoyed this chapter, and if you like my writing, check out some of the other stories I've done! I appreciate comments, kudos, extra kudos, questions, rereads, and anything else you're willing to give me. For a more direct line of communication, you can find me @lirabuswavi on Tumblr. Have a great day, and I'll see you for the next chapter.</p>
<p>Second to last chapter, let's fucking go!<br>Chapter warnings: Swearing, but by this point you should be familiar with it.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_16_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>I love a good dramatic reveal. I love betrayl and breaches of trust in writing, they're great. I've read many 'reveals gone bad' stories. But this story? Isn't one of them. I love drama but I also love understanding. And this is what I wanted it to be! There's hurt, there's worries, there's broken trust, but they're also not taking it out on each other. The point of a meeting is to talk, to listen, to try to understand, not yell or berate. Like was said in this chapter, they know better. Do they have flaws? Blindspots? Of course! Batman's allergic to sharing his thoughts, Superman's bad at handling things when they hit too close to home, Flash sometimes forgets that people don't think as quick as him. They're all people. They all have flaws. But they're also heroes, they chose to be heroes, they chose to hold themselves to a higher standard, and they're going to do their damn best to meet it. So, as much as I love drama and emotionally charged situations... this ain't it. This is rational, intelligent people having a rational, intelligent conversation. And it works!<br>I hope you enjoyed this chapter, there's only one left to go. The formatting for the next one is going to be a little different, if all goes to plan. I love comments, kudos, questions, extra kudos, and whatever you're willing to give me. Have an awesome day, and I'll see you next time for the final chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter Warnings: None.</p>

<p>So that’s the end of things. I’m not quite sure what to say. I’ll start with the facts. This was the first multichapter I started. This will also be the first one I finish. As of writing this, Who’s Old Now is part of 30 collections, has 2,438 comments, 4,017 bookmarks, 15,052 kudos, and 200,113 hits. Even with the numbers laid out in front of me, I’m still in shock. This is far more than I ever thought it’d be.<br>I started this as just a oneshot, a fun little idea cobbled together from a few tidbits on Tumblr that culminated into a fun little scene. I was inspired by @doodleforfics on Tumblr, when they gave me my first ever fanart. I was in the car, and had to pull over in my culdesac I was crying so hard. The first thing I did was send it to my brother, because I was so overwhelmed with all I was feeling. Proud? Honoured? Flattered? So indescribably happy and excited that I was almost late for my appointment? Whatever it was, it was what inspired several scenes in this fic and its overall expansion from a oneshot.<br>So, I guess that this is thank you. Thank you @doodlesforfics for my first ever piece of fanart. Thank you to every person who commented, I read all of them, and I love them. Thank you to the people who commented on every chapter, who binge read and left a comment as you went. I saw them and I love them. Thank you for all the kudos, waking up to a kudos email from AO3 has gotten me through some bad days. Thank you to the people who left ideas that inspired chapters, thank you to the people who told me I made them smile, to the ones who told me I made them cry. Thank you so much.<br>And then this is goodbye. Goodbye to my most popular story. Goodbye to the story I’ve worked on the longest. Goodbye to this labour of love. You’re an important part of who I’ve made myself to be, and I know I’ll grow further. I love you, and I’ll miss you even as I know this ending is for the best. I’m glad I finished this.<br>So, for the last time on Who’s Old Now, thank you for reading. I love comments, kudos, extra kudos, questions and whatever you’re willing to give me. If you like what I’ve done here, check out my account to see what else I’ve done. I have multiple ongoing stories and series. Have a good day and an even better life.<br>Goodbye.</p>"

<p>Also: couldn't fit it into this chapter but you should know that Harry and Tom also regularly hang out with the Potter family and because there is no war, James and Lily don't get married until they are twenty-five. They have their first child at twenty-six, and no one is happier than Harry to meet his little little sister.</p>
<p>At one family dinner, Fleamont and Euphemia are dreamily retelling the story of how they discovered their long-lost son. James gets in on the telling of how he found out he had an older brother and laughingly casts the direct descendant spell on Harry to illustrate his recollections.</p>

<p>this is so fucking self-indulgent okay i've written this half asleep and barely paying any attention to if it makes sense or even is good. it doesn't have to be canon to the fic if u don't want it to be, i didn't plan this epilogue at all, i just rlly wanted to do a ""moments of life"" character study type idea for dreamling after the canon of WWTLF but i didn't want to make a whole new fic for it. also yes to all the people saying they hope i write more dreamling, don't worry i will be. my brain is currently being chewed on by a fucking witcher AU of all things</p>
<p>here's a <a href=""https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/ranchdiip/694067709616455681"" rel=""nofollow"">tumblr post about my WWTLF lore</a></p>

<p>Reader has a nose bleed and Moon, who does not have good memories of their blood, helps them.</p>
<p>Spoilers for Solar Lunacy</p>
<p>TW for injury and injury suturing</p>","<p>Hello! This fic exists purely to dump all the drabbles I've been writing on tumblr here and there for my other fic, Solar Lunacy and that universe for better organization. These prompts were given to me by folks on tumblr, so I'll have a prompt and a name at the start of each chapter. These aren't in any chronological order and some of these drabbles/oneshots may contain spoilers for Solar Lunacy, so be warned. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>Note of context: on tumblr I drew a comic where at the point where the DA is at home with y/n, the maintence man comes along with a stray kitten and offers it to them. The reader is reluctant because they don't know how the DA will react, but the DA (namely Sun) is excited for the kitten, so it's a running joke now</p>
<p>Note: Spoilers for a future chapter of Solar Lunacy</p>
<p>Note: MAJOR Spoilers for a future chapter of Solar Lunacy. Drabble can be read stand-alone but more detailed hints can only be picked up if you read SL.</p>
<p>This written prompt is fluff/domestic shenanigans with Y/N having a habit of poor self-care, but the DA helps that.</p>
<p>Note: Major Spoilers for Solar Lunacy</p>
<p>Drunk! Reader x DCA (Moon Centric) Set Post-Fire / DCA is living with Reader. May contain slight spoilers for Solar Lunacy ARC 3.</p>
<p>NOTE: This one was HIGHLY requested by a lot of people omg. This one-shot is leaning more romantic, contains drinking alcohol and suggestive humor. Moon is caring for a drunken reader.</p>
<p>Again, this one was very much requested! I'm glad people liked the previous one so much they wanted to see a follow-up with Sun lol</p>
<p>CW: Drinking mention, (1) puking instance and other typical syptoms of hangover. Nudity mention in a non-sexual situation (you eat soup while a nice hot bath, yay.) and some suggestive humor.</p>
<p>This was orignally a prompt drabble, but I got carried away so now it's a simple Halloween drabble of it's own without the prompt.</p>
<p>Set in future ARC 2 (lateish) of Solar Lunacy: The DCA's reputation has improved, Moon has been reinstated as the Daycare Attendant and is doing well so far combatting the virus. Fire has not happened yet.</p>
<p>NOTE: The reader does have a 'themed' costume but the actaul apperence of the costume is not decribed, so up to however you visualize it</p>
<p>Set post-fire. Please read or see previous installments about world building. Just a fluffy thingie real quick</p>
<p>Pre-fire, Solar Lunacy Arc 2. Bit of some jealous Moon in the subtext ;)</p>
<p>Based off a draft scene I had for Solar Lunacy, so you may see this scene again in a future chapter of SL. (Slight spoilers)</p>
<p>I pulled another Solar Lunacy bullet draft out for this prompt, so this is more of a SL crumb than it is a stand-alone drabble. Expect to see this scene again in SL, but maybe written better (and a different beginning and ending, some details more fitting, ect)</p>
<p>Set in the time period where Moon is not yet reinstated as DCA, still has 'glitch issues', Reader is somewhat used to it.</p>
<p>If confused: Prompt giver is referencing a couple of comics and previous drabbles where reader and DCA have obtained a kitten. The comics are on tumblr if need to find.</p>
<p>This drabble is Romantic-leaning!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the fact that my Sun cannot lie, so he either deflects or avoids the question, while Moon is more blunt. Takes place in ARC 2 (Moon reinstated as DCA, restrictions taken off Sun)</p>
<p>(Also, consider this a draft crumb for a future chapter of Solar Lunacy, so, spoilers. You may see a similar scene in the actual fic later.)</p>
<p>Contains some spoilers for ARC 3 (Post-Fire) of Solar Lunacy, so please consider this a crumb! <br>Notes: Contains blood mention, obv, and character exibihiting some subtle signs of PTSD.</p>
<p>(Maybe some major spoilers for Solar Lunacy, TW for some robot gore, human injury)</p>"

<p>[cackle’s academy is the witching school from the book by jill murphy: <i>the worst witch</i>. it has had multiple series throughout the years including a Halloween movie from the eighties. it features a mostly female cast and is a comfort series for my little sister so i'm pretty fond of it myself, if you’re looking for something cute and easy to watch i def recommend the 90s series on tubi or the 2020 series on netflix.]</p>
<p>[content warning: there is a scene mentioning a civilian's death as well as the aftermath. this description will start with <b>Although there are less crimes around the holiday</b> and ends with <b>Do you have somewhere you can go?</b>. it’s not too descriptive at all but if reading about death bothers you please skip the aforementioned scene.]</p>

The other League members don't know this is a problem because they have no idea Batman has kids, much less that Nightwing is one of them. Bruce decides to do the only reasonable thing: go on vacation. His children probably won't burn down anything too important.</p>
<p>Dick just wants to defend his family and brag about his siblings. Good thing his father taught him a few things about the importance of detailed plans and talented allies.</p>
<p>The prank war starts with petty theft, purple, and cows.</p>
<p>Possible ghost kitties, a cow, a cactus, and several Bats invade the Tower. There are a few realizations had but the Bats still aren't found.</p>
<p>Bruce returns to the Watchtower is not surprised by what he finds. The Justice League has questions and actually gets some answers. The Batfamily definitely wins the war though.</p>","<p>Hello everyone! I started this story at a random point in my time travel work when I needed a bit of lightheartedness. This story has a couple family feels moments (I can't help myself)) but mainly focuses on BAMF Batfamily pranking the League.

<p>One more to go! A few people are cluing in but the big reveal won't be until next chapter. Please enjoy a caring Hood and a giant cactus.</p>

<p>Surprise! I decided to continue this story after all - mostly because your comments on the first chapter gave me some ideas. I have no idea how long this fic will be, yet, or how often I will be able to update, sry.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing: I adjusted the rating.</p>
<p>I finished this a lot sooner than I thought I would. Just don’t expect me to always update so quickly :D</p>
<p>Alright, we’re heading into not-so-fluffy territory. <strong>Check out the tags if certain topics trigger you</strong> (I updated them.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this (by my standards) unusually long chapter :)</p>
<p>I hope all of you had a merry Christmas! :)</p>
<p>A short chapter, but also a special one. I think you’ll realize why pretty quickly :D</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish you all a happy new year! :)</p>

<p>Before anyone asks: this will probably be the only chapter from Tom’s perspective. And we’re nearing the end of the story. There are about 3 to 5 chapters left, I think.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_12_endnotes"">notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>There should be two chapters left now - maybe three, depending on how the next chapter goes.</p>

<p>Tom: How did you manage to get attacked two times in as many days?<br>Harry: …<br>Harry: Are you saying that’s not normal?</p>
<p>Anyway, there’s only one more chapter left! As you can probably already guess, this fic will have a somewhat open ending.</p>
<p>Edit: I decided to write a sequel. You can find it here: https://archiveofourown.org/works/49149223/chapters/124006294</p>

<p>Alright, that’s it. I hope you don’t mind the open ending too much. There’s a chance that I’ll write a sequel at some point, but I don’t want to promise anything. Anyway, thanks for reading :)</p>

<p>This was originally supposed to be all humor, no feels, so, idrk what happened in this chapter. Not even I saw the proposal coming until I wrote it, but, alas, James Potter will do as James Potter does.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am determined to keep this fic as light-hearted as possible so Three’s Family will end here. However, if you feel the need for more details about how Harry and Draco will affect the past, you’re in luck because I have something resembling a sequel already half-written. Subscribe to the series for part 2, which will feature a much higher ratio of feels to humor, a depressed Harry adjusting to life without Ron and Hermione, a Regulus/Draco bromance, a marauder-worthy master of death, a jealous Remus, a very barebones description of the horcrux hunt because it’s been done before by others with more enthusiasm than I can bother to muster, a semi-redemption for Peter and a purely-hypothetical redemption for Snape, and some hopefully humorous Harry-shenanigans-centric drinking games.</p>"

<p>I know, Deadpool is the poster boy for shitty morals, but I think even some characters must have things they aren’t okay with. Here, Deadpool’s is consent. (And the character himself has a history of sexual abuse in the comics, SO.) I ship Peter with a lot of people, but I hate ships that depict Peter in high school, dating someone in their late 20s/30s. Little 15/16 year olds dating people 30+? Creepy. CREEPY. Also, very illegal. </p>
<p>I love the Avengers, including Tony. However, the man’s roles in some things (Ultron, Civil War, ect) make me so mad. I can love a character and admit they still have a lot of faults. The Avengers are my favourite superhero group, and I write them as the softest, kindest sweethearts. And maybe I made Tony more dickish than usual in this—especially considering the fact that I usually write him as a secretly schmoopy, selfless individual—but hey. Whatever.</p>

<p>Hi hello I wrote this in a fugue state, and have most of it done. I'm not Jewish but have done my best to research specifics for this fic. Please feel free to correct me!</p>
<p>Anyway, I've given Tim the power to come back to life. How does he have this ability? Idk his mom had a water birth near some lazarus pits or something. This will never be examined closely, at least not in this fic. As for canon, uh. I've taken the timeline and made it my own. There is no such thing as DC canon, so I have cherry picked my favourite parts like a monkey picks bugs from its sibling's fur.</p>
<p>Enjoy, leave a comment, bookmark or kudos. Chapter title comes from 'Chelsea' by Phoebe Bridgers.</p>
<p>EDIT: quick note; Tim is an incredibly unreliable narrator in this. If you're expecting a straightforward 'poor little meow meow Tim he's so mistreated and abused by the mean mean Bats', then this is NOT the fic for you. Nor is this bashing of any kind of any character. Do not complain in the comments about it. Thank you.</p>

<p>oh my god thank you all for the support and comments, like holy shit??? thank you all so so much, i hope you like this chapter, though it may seem a bit wonky at times. most of my batman knowledge comes from a) the 1998 YJ run, b) DC Rebirth, c) Red Robin, and d) trawling through fanfics and the wiki. bc of that, i firmly do not believe in a consistent DC canon and instead just write what i want. so yeah, if something seems inconsistent or off, it's because im making a whole ass frankenstein's monster out of the source material and my own headcanons. also my desire to make writing easier for myself.</p>
<p>regardless, as many of you have rightly pointed out: tim is not a reliable narrator. so keep that in mind, especially towards the end. anyway, onwards to the chapter!</p>
<p>chapter title comes from 'Neptune' by Sleeping At Last.</p>

<p>hot damn i did not expect this many people to like this story. I decided to add a fourth chapter and make it a series, because i have additional Thoughts TM about this fic, and also have other ideas surrounding the premise. (one which currently in development is where tim decides the best way to get rid of insomnia is. you guessed it. killing himself. so while up in the titans tower, all alone and safe in his room, frustrated and exhausted, he decides to go with the world's shittiest melatonin and offs himself. cue jason walking in and going What The Fuck)</p>
<p>anyway, thank you all so so much, if you enjoyed please leave a comment, bookmark and kudos, and I will be seeing you all soon.</p>

<p>Into the homestretch now!!! i am genuinely stunned by how much support and how many comments i got last chapter, like holy shit, deranged tim really hits the spot huh. well here's more of it. thank you guys so so much for your comments, you have no idea how delighted i am to see how much people enjoy this. i hope you still like this after this chapter because uh. i put the batfam through the wringer. not as badly as next chapter, but right now, these poor idiots arent talking to each other. </p>
<p>i wrote this when i should have been writing a draft essay (due today whoops) but i genuinely could not stop writing. i go a bit more in depth into tims powers but uh. dont think too hard about it. ill explore it more in another fic. probably. we'll see. anyway, i hope you enjoy, and i preemptively apologise for this chapter. </p>

<p>did tim seriously invent a device that could mess with konnors hearing just in case tim died so kon wouldnt question not hearing his heartbeat? yes. yes he did. </p>
<p>once again, tim is not a reliable narrator. the way he understands things gets misinterpreted and distorted very easily. i absolutely love every member of the batfam, and very much Do Not Do Bashing. i find it a disservice to the characters and think it prevents an examination into why someone reacts in a specific way. </p>
<p>dick is terrified out of his mind, and he's always been a bit petty and easily frustrated. add on the stress of being batman for almost a year, he really isnt in the proper mindset to talk to tim calmly. barbara is also at her limit, and as the other person next to tim who saw how bruce spiralled after jason, shes furious that tim would do that to them all again. bruce is clueless and thinks tim wants space, especially because hes emancipated. rest assured hes making sad longing eyes as he watches tim leave, while telling himself that he has to respect his childrens boundaries. alfred is barely holding everyone together, and needs a holiday. damian doesnt know what the fuck is going on but knows its Bad and tries to help in his weird, awful way. steph is not dealing. with what you ask? she doesn't know either. and cass is absolutely desperate and furious that she cant make the words and thoughts make sense. </p>
<p>They Are Having A Time. And Not A Good One. </p>
<p>anyway, an actual, in depth bruce and tim reunion will happen next chapter, along with comfort, cuddles, and pain. there will be POVs galore. i am currently crying as i realise how many other one-shots im going to have to write because there are so many other paths i wanted to explore. (tim actually running away, tim NOT CUTTING OFF HIS ARM and being trapped by Ra's, DICK ARRIVING JUST AS TIM IS STABBED, etc. fuck im never going to get my masters at this rate.)</p>
<p>thank you all so much for reading and supporting this story, i cant believe the sheer amount of people who enjoy it. as always, leave a comment, bookmark and kudos!!!</p>
<p>bug, i hear you say, bug, wasnt this meant to be four chapters long.</p>
<p>no, i reply. youre imagining things. i definitely did not write more than expected about the batfam reacting to tims death. i definitely did not underestimate how much i had to say. i definitely did not lie when i said last chapter that things would be resolved.</p>

<p>WELL. It's been a RIDE people. I have been blown away by the amount of support this story has received. I joined the fandom fairly recently (last October/November), and became gripped by so so many ideas. This was just the first one that I had to write. And it has been a journey. I've made so many friends, joined different events, and have been inundated with new ideas. It has been a delight to write this and show it to you all. Thank you so much for your support, your comments and bookmarks and follows. I genuinely hope you enjoyed this chapter, and will be posting an epilogue sometime this week. Beyond that though, I look forward to writing my next piece!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I can be found rambling on my <a href=""https://www.tumblr.com/liverobinreaction"" rel=""nofollow"">tumblr</a>, or on discord. Thank you once again, and I hope to see you all soon!</p>
<p>quick note: im not interested in constructive criticism. if there's a typo or weird sentence then that's fine, but if you would have preferred me to write a scene in a different way or dont like my characterisation/pacing/etc then just. dont comment about it.</p>
<p>I am open to any transformative works, including art, podfics, translations, and written works inspired by my fics, as long as I am properly contacted and credited! I EXPLICITLY FORBID ANYONE FROM FEEDING MY FICS TO AI.</p>

<p>Yes, hello, welcome. Why did I write this??? I don't know, I was bored and I think I'm funny. Also, I love putting Enid through the ringer, she delights my brain like nothing else.</p>
<p>Anyways, these idiots are all like 21+ so expect some <em>spice.</em> Though I'll probably not update this fic as often as my main one. Which, by the by, if you haven't read my other Wenclair story, My Love Makes me a Monster, please check it out!! Enid is especially an idiot in that one :)</p>

<p>Wednesday, who watches all of Enid's videos and secretly follows her Twitter: Excellent, I'm pushing her toward the edge of insanity.</p>
<p>ARE YOU ALL...GOOD??? I WOKE UP TO OVER 50 COMMENTS, LIKE YOU GOOD???!!! Okay but in all seriousness, thank you guys so much for the amazing support!!! I didn't think this story would be THIS FUCKING POPULAR!!</p>

<p>I...I'm...I'm truly speechless. Like, thank you???? You guys are utterly insane, but like in the best way possible. Anyways, here y'all go, have at it.</p>
<p>By the way, I have a third Wenclair fic planned out, similar to this one but instead everyone is human and stuff, and Wednesday and Eugene have an apartment together. Eugene is a Twitch streamer with a mysterious roommate who goes by the name 'Bats' on streams. If that sounds interesting to you guys, let me know, and I'll get to work on it.</p>

<p>Hi, apologies for not doing this sooner, I thought I made the twitter usernames pretty obvious, but I forgot I'm the author so of course they are obvious to me. Anyways, here you go!</p>
<p>Enid the Wolf - Enid<br>Bia Bar - Bianca<br>yoki bear - Yoko<br>Divy - Divina<br>former slenderman - Xavier<br>ASnake - Ajax<br>Black Butterfly - ;) unknown</p>
<p>Thanks for the amazing comments and support of this silly little fic my guys, I'm still very much stunned at how this funny little story blew up so fast. Anyways, as always, I hope you enjoy the new chapter!</p>
<p>Also, to clarify some stuff. Enid is 22 while Wednesday is 21 (soon to be 22), they meet freshman year in college, and right now they are juniors, so they've been rooming together for almost three years now; so these girls are as thick as thieves (who are in love with each other).</p>

<p>Wednesday's sleepy little lizard brain: Cold, find warmth.<br>Enid, a very warm body: Hey sleepy head, you wanna sit-<br>Wednesday, stopped listening after sit: Yes.</p>
<p>No birthday stream??? Wednesday had more important things to, and Enid was in no mood to share Wednesday with her thirsty fans. Once again, thank you all for the crazy and amazing support!!! You guys brighten my day with your kind words, and eagerness for the next chapter!!</p>
<p>And yes, I had to give Wednesday a poem tattoo and I thought Emily Dickinson's Wild Nights was very fitting for a secret romantic like Wednesday. Also, the song playing is People Are Strange by The Doors; I like to think Wednesday listens to a lot of like 70s and 80s rock.</p>
<p>Sorry if any of you hated me describing the tattoos in such detail, but as someone who wants to be covered in tattoos, I wanted to bring them to life in my writing.</p>

<p>Sad girl hours??? In my funny little fic??!! Yes because I love Enid and think she's neat. In other news, Y'ALL ARE AMAZING!!! Thanks for your well wishes, but I'm all good now my dudes!!</p>

<p>By popular demand I wrote smut. Shoutout to my girlfriend for reading this for me, everyone say thank you to her, without her I would have lost my nerve about making this chapter.</p>
<p>Also my girlfriend says: yo what's up, leeches</p>
<p>I gotta say y'all, we're getting close to the end of this story; there'll probably be three more chapters. I've had a blast writing this fic, and I'm still stunned by how popular it became in such a short amount of time.

<p>First off, congrats to everyone that guessed correctly on Wednesday being a bit of a dragon. I will say she'll never be a true dragon, all she'll ever be able to do is form scales and teeth, and she can't breathe fire, much to her disappointment.</p>
<p>Second, we have two chapters left, and the next one chapter is the duel between Gomez and Enid.</p>
<p>Don't know about you all, but I like to chew gum when I'm all fidgety and nervous.</p>
<p>Anyways, one more chapter to go for this fic!!!</p>
<p>AND THAT'S THE END FOLKS!!!! Thank you all for reading and your amazing support!!</p>
<p>I know a lot of you guys didn't want to see an end this fic, but maybe this will not be the total end of this AU! If I ever get the inspiration we might see a squeal to this fic!!</p>"

<p>The signs used in here are based off of ASL (American Sign Language). I know some of the basics because I took a very short introductory course because I thought the class was interesting but unfortunately I didn’t get much education on the language after that bc my school doesn’t offer it :( I would love to take it in the future tho, but for now, all of the signs in here are either made up or derived directly from ASL.

<p>Yes, in my head, if John was Mycroft’s PA, we wouldn’t have the whole mess of Moriarty’s evil plans in Season 2. You would still have a Sebastian Moran running free, just to keep the world a little exciting for them. </p>
<p>I hit up Google for a variety of skin conditions before I found one to fit Sherlock’s deductions. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the guts to Google for how long a body takes to rot in the desert, so that’s completely made up. However, my beta-reader David, knows all kinds of things and suggested that it probably takes some time for bodies to rot in a desert, considering the low humidity and the high amount of preservatives in army rations. </p>

<p>annnnd here we go! final chapter!!!! I did not think this fic would ever take this long to complete, but to be fair it was mostly a side project that i used to take breaks from writing other stuff. i did not ever think for a second so many people would like it so much, so im kinda sorry because i feel like its not even close to my best stuff. i usually write it when im overtired, so thats my bad.<br>anyway! i love you all, thank you SO MUCH for all your comments and appreciation, and as always, please tell me if something needs to be fixed!<br>enjoy! &lt;3</p>

There is a lot of societal pressure on sparks to pick and alpha to bond with, but once that happens they will be under the alpha's authority. </p>
<p>I'm not going into the depth of backstory and world-building that I sometimes go into. There are certain questions I'm not exploring (such as how Stiles' mother was a spark but was married to a human). This story is just a short bit of fun. It's possible I'll come back to this 'verse and play at a later date, but there may be questions about culture that I don't answer in this fic. </p>
<p>There will be some non-consensual groping from one of the other alphas in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Six days cooped up in his own room is well past Stiles' lack of human contact limit.</p>
<p>Little bit of a shorter chapter, I think, but not by much. I still have a pretty decent backlog already written, and I'm hoping to get more done this weekend, so I should be able to maintain the ""chapter every few days"" thing for a bit longer!</p>","<p>This story picks up from the end of the season 2 finale. It's mostly canon compliant, although I've tweaked some details to suit the story. For example, in that last scene of the finale between Stiles and Scott, Stiles' cheek is fully healed. I'm... condensing the timeline a bit, and it's fair to say that something like that scene may have happened, but sooner (in this fic) than the canon implies. Make sense?</p>
<p>Also, the rating is possibly end game, we'll see how that goes, and the relationships are tentative. Haha, I AM REALLY SELLING THIS, I BET. I've been having fun writing it though, and I got antsy about posting it, so here we are. Hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Longer chapter for you guys! Just a heads up, the next one might not be up until the end of this week.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, another long one, and I didn't even include everything I'd initially intended to be in this chapter. Whooops. You may also notice that I've changed the number of chapters from 7 to a question mark. It's possible that a plot may have crept in and taken up residence without my consent, so I do apologize for that. As soon as I have a better idea of how this is going to progress, I'll put up another estimate.</p>
<p>Anyway, yes, plot ahoy! Hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>I keep expecting to sit down and write a quick, short chapter, and then I end up with almost five thousand words. Sorry for keeping you guys waiting! (And on a cliffhanger, no less!) Hopefully this chapter doesn't disappoint. :) No guarantees on when the next chapter will be - I'm gearing up for a couple busy weeks, but hopefully I'll have time to squeeze in an update somewhere along the line! Thanks again for reading, and I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Also, this chapter does contain some descriptions of a panic attack. It's not particularly graphic, but I just thought I would give a head's up!)</p>
<p>Another long-ish one for you guys! Sorry for the slight wait - real life has been terribly busy, so I haven't had much of a chance to write. The busy-ness isn't guaranteed to let up any time soon, so don't worry if this goes another week or so without being updated. I promise, I am still plugging away! :)</p>
<p>I am so very sorry for the wait, everyone! I honestly didn't expect it to be this long, but life has been busy, and then I got sidetracked with another plot bunny, and I'm afraid this fic got shifted to the back burner for awhile. I have neither forgotten about this fic, nor abandoned it, however, and I am actually really excited for what's coming up, so never fear! Updates might not be as quick as they were at the start, but I'm determined that this fic shall not languish in WIP-dom for too much longer. As ever, thanks so much for reading, and I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>A thousand and one apologies for the ridiculously long wait. This chapter gave me FITS, but now it is done and it is posted and thank goodness for that. I'd intended to lump another scene or two in with this one, but I figured it had been a long enough wait between chapters, and that I'd rather just go ahead and get this one posted. I'm thinking there'll be one more chapter, maaaaybe two before I get this all wrapped up.</p>
<p>Also PLEASE NOTE: I've added a couple tags for this chapter in order to warn for it being a violent one. Nothing too far away from canon, I don't think, but please be aware!</p>
<p>Thanks again for your patience, and I hope this doesn't disappoint!</p>
<p>It's finally finished, yay! A HUGE thank you to everyone who stuck with me on this story. I never expected it to take nearly this long to completely, nor did I expect it to take some of the turns it did. Of course, now that I've had days and weeks and months to overload my brain with all sorts of brilliant meta, there are some things I would probably do differently, but overall, I'm really happy with the way this turned out. </p>
<p>I will probably go on a comment spree sometime this week, so don't be surprised if you suddenly get a reply on a comment you left awhile ago. (I am SO grateful for the lovely, LOVELY comments you've all left, and I do apologize for dropping the ball so terribly on responses. I'll be getting to them in the near future, for sure!)</p>
<p>I hope the final chapter doesn't disappoint! Thanks again for being awesome and SO patient! &lt;3</p>

<p>hiiii everyone! it's been a minute, hasn't it ☺️</p>
<p>i wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who read and left a little heart on this work! i'm constantly blown away by the love people have for this fic and by how many people have read it.</p>
<p>it's insane to me that this little fic reached 10k kudos! i still vividly remember writing this fic like it was just yesterday, and at the time i had no idea it would ever be read and loved by this many. i don't know if 10k kudos is considered a milestone but it certainly is to me. really, you don't know how much i appreciate all of you for giving my works a chance and reading my words and stories.</p>
<p>i wanted to give you guys this a little gift to say thank you. i'm sorry it's not much, but i hope you all enjoy it anyway 💜. once again, thank you!!</p>

<p>She was still visible, her dark hair bobbing under the street lamps a couple blocks away.</p>
<p>“Marinette.”</p>
<p>Adrien blew out a confused breath. His fiery Ladybug… was the quiet little mouse who sat behind him in class?</p>
<p>“What. The.”</p>
<p>This… would take some getting used to.</p>
<p>“How do you get a girl to talk to you?”</p>
<p>Nino choked and swallowed quickly. “You’re asking me this question?”</p>
<p>Adrien frowned. “You can talk to everyone. Why wouldn’t I ask you?”</p>
<p>“Dude, have you listened to me? Do you hear the things that come out of my mouth?”</p>
<p>“But that’s why you’re great,” Adrien insisted. “You just say whatever, and people just say whatever back. How do you do that?”</p>
<p>Nino stared at him. “You are — and I use the word ‘literally’ unironically here — literally a model. What makes you think you have to do anything to get a girl to talk to you?”</p>
<p>She eyed him suspiciously. “Do you flirt with me in real life too?”</p>
<p>Chat Noir tried to cover up a choke. “Who’s to say which part is real life, mademoiselle?”</p>
<p>Ladybug smacked his arm. “Do you or do you not flirt with Marinette, you shameless pile?”</p>
<p>Chat Noir stared down at her. Flirt with Marinette? As Adrien? The concept was… new and a little bit weird but…</p>
<p>Large blue eyes met his, and a delicate pink mouth smiled at him a little bit. Ladybug. Damn, but she could make it kind of hard to breathe.</p>
<p>Chat Noir swallowed gently. He licked his lips. “That could… be arranged.”</p>
<p>“Hi!” Alya always seemed to be super high-energy. “Nino said you guys wanted to check out the Dupains’ new macarons, and I was like, I’m coming!” </p>
<p>“Is… is that what we’re doing?” Adrien glanced at Nino. The three of them walked down the school steps as the last students left in the fading afternoon light.</p>
<p>“Dude!” Nino punched his arm a little harder than necessary. “You know I know how much you like sea salt caramel! I am not about to let you miss out on an experience like this.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Right.” Adrien wracked his brain as to when he’d ever gotten worked up about sea salt caramel. Sweets weren’t something he came into regular contact with.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you guys paid that much attention to the daily flavors,” Alya commented.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Nino laid a hand on his heart and gazed heavenward. “We check online every day.”</p>
<p>“What’s your favorite flavor, really. Nino’s opinion notwithstanding.”</p>
<p>She was really close. With no mask, those big blue eyes were just…</p>
<p>“This is not a hard question.” Marinette tapped her fingers on the counter.</p>
<p>Something deep inside shivered at that very Ladybug tone. But. Now he kind of wanted to see blushy Marinette again. Not the one who was constantly panicked. The one who was just sort of… cutely overawed. He straightened and watched as her eyes followed him up. It was weirdly satisfying.</p>
<p>“Lavender,” he said finally. “I know I like lavender.”</p>
<p>Marinette looked at him appraisingly. “Oh? Not a usual favorite of high-school boys.” She pushed away from the counter and walked down the line of pastry cases.</p>
<p>Adrien followed. “But you admit that I’m not a usual high-school boy.” This was fun. Sort of like Chat Noir with Ladybug but with… more at stake.</p>
<p>“Chat, I know… I know you’re up here.” Ladybug’s voice sounded unsure. Timid. More like Marinette. “And I know you’re probably back to normal now. So. I won’t come any closer.”</p>
<p>Adrien exhaled carefully.</p>
<p>“Unless you want me to.”</p>
<p>He sucked in a hard breath. Shit!</p>
<p>“... I guess that’s a no.” A shuffling noise indicated that Ladybug had sat down on the other side of the air conditioning unit. “You know, I have every right to just walk right around here and get a good look at your face once and for all. Or at least, I think I do,” she finished quietly.</p>
<p>Marinette felt her own grin falter. Adrien was still… Adrien, and he was looking at her in a way she frankly didn’t know what to do with. “Um.” Dammit with the ums again! She tucked her hair behind her ear and glanced down into her lunchbox. “What, um, what are you… what’s on your mind?” WHAT’S ON YOUR MIND ARE YOU SERIOUS.</p>
<p>Adrien blew out a breath. “Why don’t you act like this around me all the time?”</p>
<p>Marinette’s eyes flew open wide. Her mouth fell open.</p>
<p>Adrien stared back at her.</p>
<p>“... Oops.”</p>
<p>“But it’s almost like some people have connections or something,” he pressed.</p>
<p>“Connections? To luck?”</p>
<p>“Now you, you might have an in with good luck, right?” He held her gaze, talking fast. “Me, I’m… I’m the opposite.”</p>
<p>“You’re the opposite. Of me.” It was not a question.</p>
<p>Adrien held his breath.</p>
<p>“You silly cat,” Marinette whispered.</p>","<p>This was written in response to a Five-Minute writing challenge that ninjakins put to me. My five minutes were up after this line:<br>""Forgetting that Ladybug was still out there. Somewhere.""</p>
<p>...<br>And so I kept going for a bit. Because I didn't know that I barely write 115 words in five minutes, apparently.</p>

<p>Did you know that the main character of Trauma Centre is called Derek Stiles? I completely forgot until after I mentioned the game, but I guess it must have been lurking around the back of my head somewhere. What a coincidink!</p>

<p> <i>On a somewhat more serious note than anything else in this story, I just want to bring up the fact that, looking back on this fic, it plays into quite a lot of heterocentric gender roles in a way I really wish it hadn't. I'm not going to edit anything, just because I don't like to edit things I've already put up for public consumption. The internet should witness ALL my mistakes! However, I will ask readers to just take note of the fact that the 'pack mom' trope I employed here (unless done phenomenally and subversively, as I'm sure it has been!), as fun as it is, is a bit sexist and heteronormative, and its worth bearing in mind as we consume our fiction and fanfiction. Thanks for your time! :D</i></p>"

<p>Second, as I mentioned in the beginning, please do your research before choosing a shop to go to, if you’re interested in body modification. This is serious business. While I’d hope there aren’t any places around like Alastair’s, there are unfortunately a lot of people who think tattooing at home or with unsterilized equipment or without proper instruction is okay. No professional worth his or her title would ever be okay with a) letting someone underage tattoo others or b) using tattooing as a method of torture/punishment. Obviously I’ve bent reality a little in this fic, but I can’t stress enough that <i>this is fanfiction,</i> and while on the surface this is a fairly accurate portrayal of the mod community, <i>what Dean did in the past is not okay</i>.</p>

The Winchesters have showed up on her doorstep and she’s making the best of it the only way she knows how. By being the little sister Dean never wanted and shipping the shit out of Destiel.</p>
<p>Charlie drags Sam headfirst into plotting to make Destiel as canon as she possibly can - despite his protests because Sam <em>really</em> doesn't want to talk about who his brother is sexing up, he just wants Dean and Cas to be happy.</p>
<p>Charlie would throttle Sam if she could. But there's an Angel of the Lord sitting in front of her and he just <em>might</em> frown upon that. As queen of her high school improv group, Charlie throws those skills to good use and decides to take a page out of Team Free Will's handbook (she'll make it up as she goes along and keep her fingers crossed that Dean or Cas doesn't mess this up).</p>
<p>With Castiel in on the scheming now, things aren't actually looking as up as Charlie was hoping they would. If he would just <em>pick</em> one of their plans, he and Dean would probably be getting on with the happy make-outs by now. Charlie makes the decision for everyone and Sam feels more uncomfortable than he likely thought possible.</p>
<p>The plan might have been doomed the moment they walked in the door, but Charlie swore she'd see this through to the end. She just hadn't anticipated Dean Winchester. And if she was being honest? She had <em>definitely</em> overestimated angelic patience.</p>
<p>Charlie and Sam's hard work comes to fruition in this extra. Dean and Castiel put a big black 'X' through the UST in their relationship and even manage to solve a few lingering doubts in the process.</p>","<p>I’ve only watched Season 7 once and that was a month or more ago. I adore Charlie, but I probably didn’t capture her properly since I am not even on the same scale of awesome. But I gave it a go and we ended up with this because certain people (cough<a href=""https://freckledbuttchester.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">freckledbuttchester</a>cough) put plot-bunnies in my head and all blame falls in that direction.</p>
<p>This was just supposed to be a one shot. Then people asked for more and the plot-bunnies multiplied and now it's going to be four parts (or three - because I can't decide if I wanna make a smutty chapter at the end or not). So I blame you guys for this. I really really do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>SEASON EIGHT SPOILERS</strong></p>
<p>This was supposed to be the last chapter.</p>
<p>But then the plot bunnies got promiscuous and now I honestly don't know how many chapters there will be. I'm having too much fun with this story to really care at this point. These pages are basically writing themselves now.</p>
<p>
<strong>DEFINITE SEASON EIGHT SPOILERS</strong>
</p>
<p>I'm thinking this is likely the 2nd to last chapter. The next will wrap the story up and... well. I'm <em>thinking</em> about a smutty little chapter afterward. I'm not sure. What do you guys think? Is that something you'd want?</p>
<p>This is the last chapter. But there <em>will</em> be one little smutty 'extra' uploaded next week. </p>
<p>I just want to thank everyone so much for reading. To everyone who took the time to comment and drop a kudos on this story, <em>thank you</em>. I wasn't expecting anything like this when I started this story (dude, it was supposed to be a <em>oneshot</em>). And I'm just overwhelmed by your kindness. Truly, thank you. </p>
<p>I hope you'll stick around for more stories. Thank you again. ♥</p>
<p>I tried writing this in the past tense like I did with the previous chapters. But it just came out <em>wrong</em>. So... I'm sorry about the tense shift, but this is written in the present and it's all from Castiel's point of view.</p>
<p>It's also the first time I've written smut in over a year and somehow this ended up longer than any of the previous chapters and there's a bit of a plot in there, if you look hard enough. Maybe. I dunno. There's certainly more than I ever thought was going to be in this. </p>
<p>
<strong>Thank you to everyone who's read, commented, kudos-ed, bookmarked, and subscribed to this story. Your kindness and encouragement was more than I was ever expecting and I pretty much cried every time. Thank you so much and if you plan to stick around to read anything else I post, I hope I don't disappoint you.</strong>

<p>*dramatic kdrama ost music plays in the background* so uh. what do you guys think</p>
<p>(also show of hands for everyone who loves hoseok)</p>
<p>edit: i mentioned this to one of you guys in the comments, but i'll give a heads up that i don't know if i'll be able to update in a week! so far i've mostly just been doing lighter editing since the fic is already ""finished"" in terms of storyline but i am unsatisfied with the current ending i have and i feel you guys deserve better than an ending i'm unhappy with... please be patient with me ;_;</p>
<p>i know i said it might take longer for me to update this time around but i still didn't think it would take THIS long.... anyway it's here now, sorry for the wait! ;; </p>
<p>also if this chapter had a title it would be doki doki</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_3_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>once again, i'm really blown away by how many people that seem to like this fic! your kudos and comments make me so happy ;; please talk to me, i thrive off your attention like a sunflower under the sun &lt;3</p>
<p>i was gonna offer that you guys could punch me in the face for not updating even when i said i would, but then again, if more than 600 people (????? where do u all come from omg) punched me i'd probably die so... i'm sorry for taking so long!!! OTL real life kept getting in my way :((</p>
<p>anyway there's not that much left now! next chapter will probably be the last?? i say probably bc i haven't even written all of those scenes yet lmao</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>*sound of wind blowing by sadly*</p>
<p>(i'm sorry u need to have at least one of these cliffhanger type of endings. it's the law)</p>
<p>also, since i have a <a href=""https://mochisuga.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tumblr</a> now you guys could, idk, hit me up? talk to me about sugakookie? or just come watch me embarrass myself ^^'</p>
<p>haha..... /o\ </p>
<p>i'm not even gonna make excuses. i'm very sorry for the wait! i obsessed way too much over this chapter, so now in the end i'm just posting it instead of it being a source of anxiety for the next week as well. i really really hope you guys will like it TT ♡</p>

</p>
<p>i feel personally victimized by the end of this fic and i'm the one who wrote it</p>
<p>pls imagine one of those emotional montages they always put at the credits of kdramas that are like [emotional ost music] their eyes meeting for the first time... yoongi leaving the café, jungkook crying alone... yoongi rushing to save him, yoongi hOLDNIG HIM [music swells] AWKWARD MOMENTS AT YOONGI'S APARTMENT, THE TWO OF THEM WATCHING EACH OTHER IN THE DARK, THE LOVE THAT BLOOMS </p>
<p>as u can see i spend way too much time thinking about things. give me money i'm ready to direct this fic</p>
<p>anyway, thank you all so much! to every person who took the time to comment, leave kudos or even just click on this fic, i love you and i'm so grateful. i could never imagine so many people would enjoy this fic ;; please know that i cherished ever single word you guys gave me as much as you did mine! </p>

<p>I NEED HELP!</p>
<p>Hey guys! I’m brainstorming another long fic—what I’m calling my Hiatus Fic (that’s not the title, lol. Doesn’t have one yet)—and I have a lot of it planned, but I need your help! I want to include all the good stuff that’s usually in my fics, plus a little more! And I’m no good at coming up with akuma ideas. So that’s where I need you guys! If you have any akuma ideas that you’d like to share, please message me on my tumblr at SKayLanphear. I can’t guarantee that they’ll appear, but I need help! You’re all so amazing, and I know from reading your reviews that you all come up with some really great ideas (I’ve even used some of them). So don’t be shy, even if you think your akuma is silly—those are some of the best ones! </p>
<p>Please, please help! That way I can make this next fic the best one yet :D</p>"

<p>Thanks to PipMer for betaing, and Zwaluw for their betaing but also their cheerleading, poking and ableism check. I wouldn't have managed this monster without you guys. </p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> This deals pretty heavily with various issues of ableism. A few times the 'R' word is used. I've tried to be as careful and respectful as I can be but I'm not disabled and if I've screwed up, I apologise in advance.</p>
<p>The Avengers also don't come off so great in this fic. It's a fic about ableism and they're the ones stuck in an ableist world view - even when they do get it, they screw up. We all do. I've done everything in my power to keep them in character and this is, in my opinion, their in-character reactions.</p>
<p><b>EDIT</b> The AMAZING Badfinch has made a Podfic for this fic, available <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/16309547"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>!</p>

<p>Okay folks, I meant to have this up before season two dropped but I didn't quite make it. Either way, here it is, the (very long) epilogue. Very long.</p>
<p>Same warning as the last chapter; I'm still an able bodied person and while I've tried to be respectful, I might screw up. </p>
<p>But as this is the comfort almost, to the hurt of the last chapter, most of the ableism has gone - though some has stayed because we're all ableist arseholes sometimes.</p>"

<p>more to come, hopefully this weekend! Contents including but not limited to: harp playing, more awkward Thorin, and (as you might expect with a kink meme fill) some gratuitous but probably fairly fluffy dwarf/hobbit boning like <i>whoa.</i> &lt;3</p>

<p>I'm so glad folks are enjoying this, including awkward!Thorin (who is a joy to torment, truly). And yes, writing about dwarves who've lost their song makes me more than a little misty, too.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading-- more to come soonish, with any luck at all!</p>
<p>Okay, so here's the deal: this is a chapter all about the Heartsongs of Thorin's company. It doesn't have any Thorin/Bilbo shenanigans at all, nor does it technically progress the plot, so if you want to skip it, you can.</p>
<p>Because fair warning, it's a bit angsty, and there are pairings implied that might not butter your muffin.</p>
<p>I'll list the pairings below, just in case you want to spoil it before reading, but I think this might work a bit better if you don't know what's coming. I leave that up to you, gentle reader.</p>
<p>

<p>Relationships/Bonds mentioned are:</p>
<p>Gloin and Bombur with their respective wives.</p>
<p>Oin, Dwalin, Balin, Nori, Dori, Bifur, and Bofur with dwarven OCs. </p>
<p>Fili and Kili with unknown dwarven women, but also with each other. Can be interpreted as Heartsongs not always being sexual (which they're not) or full on Durincest if you wish.</p>
<p>And Ori unrequited/unrealised bond with Dwalin.</p>

<b>New author's note many years later:</b>
</p>
<p>I wrote this story eight years ago, which physically hurts me to admit because I'm very old. And for most of that time I've kind of wanted to change it. At the time in the Teen Wolf fandom with this pairing specifically, I very much felt a vibe of readers being really dissatisfied if you posted a fic and it didn't get even a little explicit, so there was a pretty shoehorned sex scene in this and I haven't really been happy with it since I wrote it. There's a lot of trauma Derek's dealing with here and his relationship with Stiles is a comfort for him, and I just sort of want it to be warmer and less explicit. So I've finally gone in and revised the story to something I feel a little more comfortable with, and I'm honestly really happy with it now as it stands. I've also revised the rating because it's pretty PG-13 now.</p>
<p>Readers have loved this story and no shade to anyone who dug it with the more sexual content in it. But I left it unchanged for so long because I was worried about disappointing people, and these days I'd just rather be true to how I feel about it, if that makes sense. I've written plenty of porn for this pairing (and I also have complicated feelings about high school aged characters and media depictions and the implications of how we see teens in real life, because I contain multitudes) but this just... made me feel better to change that in this story. So I hope you guys are understanding about that if you've dropped by for a re-read, and hell, maybe it'll even make it a little fresh for you.</p>

<p>AHHHHHH OMG I REALLY FINISHED IT.</p>
<p>Eternal love and gratitude to abby for cheerleading me through and also telling me when I was screwing it up and flailing just when I needed someone to flail, every time.</p>
<p>I also owe a debt of gratitude to my own stately dog, without whom I feel I would have been unable to capture just how subtlely, gracefully dickish a dog can be. :D (I guess I should also thank him for occasionally -- but only occasionally -- allowing me to write without driving me insane. You're the best, buddy.)</p>

<p>AU where Gimli and Legolas first meet when Gimli and his mother travel to join Glóin at Erebor after it's reclaimed, and Legolas's squad is escourting them through Mirkwood. They immediately wind up arguing loudly and continue to do so the whole time, about everything under the sun. No one is at all surprised they hate each other.</p>
<p>When Gimli reaches the mountain, something Legolas said is still bothering him, so he writes to him to continue their argument because he just can't not. What ensues is an increasingly fond, and then downright sappy series of letters, while everyone around them thinks they're still at each other's throats.</p>
<p>+Bonus points if it all comes out at Gimli's seventieth birthday because he invited Legolas and they're absolutely terrible at keeping their affection hidden in person.<br>+Double bonus points if it's also an Everyone-Lives!AU.<br>+Triple bonus points if there's one single person who figured out what was going on pretty early on, and is sitting back laughing at everybody.<br>...+A cookie if that person is Dáin.</p>

<p>Alternative summary: ""He says we are engaged to each other, you moron.""</p>","<p>Okay, so some explanations might be needed here. I was sort of running into walls with a fic scenario where Sasuke and Naruto getting married is a stipulation for Sasuke being allowed back in Konoha, and then I happened to spitball ideas with EE and that gave me the plot for this fic instead. The first two scenes have been sitting on my harddrive for a year, but I finished the rest within the past week. Yeah.<br>This is also much less tropey than the whole arranged marriage thing might make you think. If you've read my other stuff you know how I like to subvert common tropes and blindside everyone a little bit. ;-)</p>
<p>I'm no longer too clear on early canon (or late canon, for that matter) because it's been ten years (fuck me), so there are some mistakes and deviations (apart from the whole, y'know, engagement thing). But let's be real, accuracy and adherence to canon is not what you are here for anyway.</p>
<p>Title inspired by the Keaton Henson song because it's entirety just screams of the dynamic between Sasuke and Naruto. </p>
<p>[I probably need to proof-read this again, but I'll do it when my eyes stop bleeding from looking at it for so long.]</p>

<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)</p>
<p>Look, I read the Narutowikia summary of everything beyond the beginning of the Fourth Shinobi war and I remembered why I stopped watching that train wreck all those years ago. Everything just got out of hand. Sasuke was totally unhinged. Jesus Christ. Let's just say, in a roundabout way he ended up being much more mellow because of the engagement here. No evil mastermind plans for everyone's favorite crisis kid.<br>So, I apologize for rushing the second half of this story but there was just no way in which I could adequately salvage the original plot again. I mean, I already kind tried that in 'Hope's on Fire' and 'Cultivate your Hunger'. There's only so much I can do.<br>Also, I had almost forgotten how gay this manga was. Researching for this really drove home the fact why sasunaru is even a thing in the first place.</p>

Oh, NO! YOU DON'T!<br>So this my first ever fic (be nice? Please?) to try to come to term with my feelings about it all. To be honest, I don't know where this is going yet, I just want to ram Captain Asshole shield up his ass.

<p>Hey, guys, I need your help with something: What Super heroes/mutants do you think should join the New Avengers?<br>Not from the X-men, but others, independent ones... Spidey is a given, of course, but I need more.<br>Just give me your pick, and if you've got time, why. I'll look them up and see who I can adopt.<br>Mucho thanks in advance!</p>

</p>
<p>So, now you know why Phil took that job: Pepper did it! (hurray for Peps!)</p>
<p>Thank you all for your suggestions!<br>I will give them my attention... On top of the ones you'll discover in this chapter.<br>Some of you will be happy to learn that Deadpool, crazy ass bastard that he is, crashed in the chapter I'm currently writing as soon as his name was mentioned... He's... Interesting to write, to say the least!</p>
<p>

<p>Before anyone says anything, I want to state I LOVE the X-men, but their moral viewpoint can sometimes be a bit narrow, especially with people who have had to make hard, and sometimes questionable life choices.<br>All the kudos to the amazing Sherza and her fic ""Damaged Defenders"" who showed that to me, so I decided to relocate a few juniors, since I think Xavier has to be aware of the problem.</p>
<p>Posting this now because early day at work tomorrow...<br>Oh, and just a word of warning before you start: I'm not American, and some of you may find what I've written offensive. (I don't think I was, but you never know on that particular subject)<br>I tried to keep it balanced, but I have some very angry Germans and Austrians on my hands... So I had to let them vent a mite.<br>And the popular press of ANY country, fanning the fires for an extra buck or two, is the same everywhere.<br>Warning issued, so you can proceed now.</p>

<p>So, here's my explanation to why Rogers has a head like a brick... When I did some thinking about it, it seemed logical to me.<br>After all, the UNlogical thing was to have Steve as the ONLY exception to the rule, no?</p>
<p>Kage, this one is for you, I think! (And all the many JARVIS admirers out there, of course... Me included)</p>

<p>So, here it is at last, the infamous Press conference.<br>My Beta tells me people throwing foodstuff is quite unrealistic, but I kept it nonetheless. (sorry VWebb!)<br>In France, we don't throw food at people either, but we used to do it, apparently, so it became quite the language trope to beware public performers and speakers about rotten tomatoes and such.<br>And to be completely honest?

<p>Clint is not very good at apologizing, is he?<br>But there are a few things that need to be said to the Avengers, and Clint always was a bit of an ass.</p>
<p>Okay, before anyone comes after me with rotten tomatoes *ducks*, I want to clarify a point: I'm not going this hard on the Russian spy because she's a woman, but because she's Natasha.<br>The MCU writers had her paired with a different guy in almost every movie (I suppose because a woman standing on her own two feet is just so out there), so I took her implied bed hopping and reasoned it out as her spy MO, using her skill to manipulate men more easily.<br>That doesn't make her a nice person, but then I don't think she is one. *shrugs*</p>

<p>I wondered for a while what was the worst thing I could do to someone like Natasha, short of killing her outright (I try not to kill people as a rule, it's awfully hard on the carpets).<br>And then it came to me: The worst thing one can do to a manipulative, compulsive liar and professional betrayer, is to make them tell the truth, ALL the truth, and nothing but the truth.<br>And in the hands of someone like Fury, that can be a lethal weapon.</p>

<p>""This thing of being a hero, about the main thing to it is to know when to die."" - Will Rogers</p>
<p>So this is the end of the story. I hope it wasn't too abrupt - I did the best I could. Honestly, I wasn't expecting the response I got, and your comments inspired me to expand a bit from what had been just a two-shot story. Originally, Team 7 was going to have only two scenes from their POV! I also was going to write a multi-POV epilogue, but then Obito's POV stole the show and now it's four chapters long, going on five. Whoops. Anyway, I dearly hope you'll all forgive me for the bittersweet ending - but try to keep this in mind:</p>
<p>The only people this story ended sadly for are the ones who were never meant to be in this world in the first place. </p>
<p>Sometimes that's the price of change. Sometimes the greatest heroes die with no ever knowing what fate they saved them from to begin with.</p>
<p>(EDIT: It's 2022 and I still get comments correcting me that that Bloody Mist only became such *after* Obito mind controlled Yagura. That's wrong, it canonically became known as the Bloody Mist when Zabuza graduated the academy at age 9, the same year Obito also graduated from Konoha academy, at the same age. It was the Bloody Mist long before Obito was 'rescued' by Madara.</p>
<p>There are plot holes in my story, it was the first story I ever completed, and there are things I would write differently if I rewrote this story today. But I wrote this story six years ago at this point. It's not perfect, but I'm leaving it as it is. Thank you for all the wonderful comments, I still read each and every one!)</p>"

<p>((fyi in the course of my research which has made for a really colorful google search history, i have learned that oil-based lubricants like vaseline are not good for penetrative sex because they break down condoms and are generally just a mess and you should use a more specifically designed sex lube that is silicone or water based. their company sells something similar to vaseline, but like... i'm me and too many sex jokes to pass up bye))</p>

No one, not even Dumbledore, expected the Girl-Who-Lived to Awaken as a sentinel. Which just goes to show you how little wizards understand Sentinels – nothing like being thrust into a new world, filled with dangers and enemies to Awaken a sentinel’s instincts.</p>
<p>Goblins have little use for wizards, but sentinels and guides are another matter entirely. Sentinels are warriors; ruthless, fierce, and without mercy on the battlefield. The kind of being a Goblin can respect. So when the Girl-Who-Lived comes into the bank, Awakening…well. There’s little they could do to aid an underaged witch without a magical guardian. A Sentinel? Anyone who tries to interfere in affairs between Sentinels and Guides and the Horde courts war.</p>
<p>Ellie leaves Gringotts with far more than she might have. The goblins send send her off, already plotting. Change is coming. A storm is building. There will be profit and battle in the coming days.</p>","<p>Notes: Magical Sentinels and Guides. A Primer.</p>
<p>Purebloods have no idea what to do with Sentinels and Guides. They are obviously powerful and show up in magical families. Great! They show up even more in muggleborns and, worse, muggles. And muggle Sentinels are a match for even a strong magical Sentinel. Bad! Also, Goblins like them. Obviously, this is a bad thing. Also, this Guide thing…they aren’t real because that would mean we have to let our pureblooded children breed with anyone they claim is their Guide even if that guide is. . . muggleborn. So Guides aren’t really real.</p>
<p>Also, Goblins like them.</p>
<p>Oh, and the Horde has separate treaties with the Sentinel and Guide communities, including the muggle ones, because hiding magic from Sentinels…didn’t work so well.</p>
<p>So, Ellie is a latent sentinel, up until the moment she walks into the Leaky Cauldron, surrounded by strangers who think they know her, who touch her — and shakes the hand of Quirrel. Who, you know, is consorting with the man who murdered her family. That would Wake a dormant Sentinel, much less a latent child of a powerful Sentinel and Guide.</p>
<p>The Goblins can see her Awakening. And meddle. A lot.</p>

<p>There may one day be more in this work, but I have a lot on the go right now so please don't hold your breath; it could be months if not years.</p>
<p>Also, for anyone who is curious about the use of 'wix' and 'wixen': these are gender neutral terms for wizard or witch. Also, wixen can be used in place of magical -- as in the Wixen World. These terms emerged from tumblr and LGBTQ+ Harry Potter communities like magicqueers (tumblr). I identify as queer (asexual, thanks for asking) so I adopted the terms and am hoping to infect AO3. Also, wixen is way less unwieldy than writing 'wizards and witches' all the damn time.</p>

<p>So just to clear up a few things before you guys read the chapter:</p>
<p>- This does not directly follow the last chapter. That being said, it does not negate the ending of the previous chapter, of Lance's self-doubts (that is mainly something that will grow with this fic, and will be touched upon in a later chapter more specifically).</p>
<p>- I'm getting carried away with plots, lol! I know the fic is focused mostly on Lance crying, but I felt that doing 5 scenarios of Lance randomly crying would not be as entertaining as perhaps making it part of his struggle in the overall chapter. I hope this is something you like?</p>
<p>- Implied Galra Keith, but the team (including Keith) have no knowledge of it... Only Haggar does.</p>
<p>

In later chapters there is fairly explicitly depicted torture and implied sexual assault, descriptions of same, and some pretty intense discussion of it by the people involved. This is all stuff that has happened in the past and is NOT depicted happening in the present, but it's still not entirely off-screen. If you think any of that might be triggering for you, PLEASE be cautious about reading this story. Some chapters have additional notes linking to end-notes that summarize the chapter so you can skip it entirely if you don't feel comfortable. If you'd like any sort of summary or bulleted points of potentially triggering content, so you know whether you'd be comfortable reading, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me here on AO3 or on <a href=""https://thewinterotter.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">my tumblr</a>. Please stay safe, friends.</p>
<p>This story is set in the general ""Neckz N Throatz"" universe, which was born on tumblr and has given rise to some sincerely awesome additions and variations. You don't need to read any of those to understand what's going on here, but you really SHOULD read them, if you haven't, just because they're all amazing. (They'll also help you get some of the references.) The original story is <a href=""https://captain-snark.tumblr.com/post/40298767852/daunt-rainglazed-helenish"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and Jen has very helpfully put together an entire lexicon of Neckz N Throatz works for her <a href=""https://swingsetindecember.tumblr.com/post/49156045894/neckz-n-throats"" rel=""nofollow"">rec list</a>.</p>
<p>My eternal thanks to DevilDoll for her mad beta skills. That makes her sound like a rabid werewolf, which is actually accurate for her staggering ability to sniff out my plot problems. :D</p>
<p>Thanks also to Siess, who commissioned this work via the <a href=""https://ao3auction.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">AO3 auction</a> and contributed not only a serious fistful of money to the AO3 but also a great prompt and some excellent cheerleading.</p>
<p>

<p>The study mentioned about eye-gazing is real and was conducted by Prof. Arthur Arun at SUNY Stonybrook. You can read more about it <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/hottopics/love/flirting.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also in reference to Derek as a pony, this is entirely the fault of <a href=""https://daunt.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Daunt</a> who is not only wonderful and talented but also <a href=""https://daunt.tumblr.com/post/49008511080/i-was-working-on-real-work-stuff-last-night-and"" rel=""nofollow"">did a sketch of some of the cast as horses</a>. There are really no words for my inability to deal with how happy that makes me.</p>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL WARNING:</b> Please note that I've added tags for past <b>coercion</b> and <b>exploitation.</b> Those were the best tagging ideas I could manage for some of the content in this chapter. It's discussed but not explicitly described, and could be triggering, so please use your discretion.</p>
<p>This chapter contains more <i>Marked</i> stuff; I'm not sure I want to <i>warn</i> for it specifically or that there's an appropriate tag I should add for it (it's not any more intense than what we've already seen with Stiles) but I do want to make you all aware that it's there.</p>
<p>My thanks as always to DevilDoll for being an awesome beta and sounding board and all-around perfect human being, and thanks as well to all of you for hanging in there even as my updates have slowed down. YOU ARE RAD.</p>
<p>This chapter hasn't been beta-read, or even really read by anybody who isn't me at all (I made some people read it and then I rewrote half of it?), but I figured if it took any longer, I would actually die from my continued attempts to get this chapter out. So I'd just like to apologize in advance, should you find any reason to desire an apology.</p>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL WARNINGS:</b> Please note that this chapter contains references to and descriptions of past abuse (sexual implied) and torture of a minor. The level of violence is canon-typical and actually adheres fairly closely to what is seen in season 1-2 canon. (Fuck ""Visionary"" I'm still pretending it never happened.) There's a use of a gendered slur and the kind of skeevy-ass comments you see on explicit Internet videos. A character is also depicted in the midst of a panic attack, although I tried not to make it too detailed because if there's one thing I've learned about myself lately it's that I apparently have a problem with sympathetic panic attacks. Awesome. I'm on a journey of self-discovery and Iron Man 3 was a little too helpful.</p>
<p>I've changed the archive warning status on this story and added a few more tags; I'm not entirely sure how to handle warnings for this since most of the more traumatic stuff is more referenced/implied than actually depicted, but if anybody has suggestions I would love them, please do leave a comment.</p>
<p>If you'd like a more thorough description of what exactly goes down in the heavier segment of this story, please feel free to skip to the end notes, where I'll provide a summary. The next chapter will most likely contain more discussion of this topic but it won't actually be shown again.</p>
<p>
(See the end of the chapter for <a href=""#chapter_10_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Here's that summary I promised: Stiles discovers Derek's previous ""porn"" work, and watches a part of one video in which an underage Derek is restrained and tortured with electricity, a lot like what we saw with Kate in the end of season one on the show. From the content of the video it can be assumed that Derek is not a willing participant. The video is posted on a fetish-oriented website with viewer comments implying that at least some of the content of the multiple videos posted is explicitly sexual. What he sees of the video and the implications of it cause Stiles to have a panic attack.</p>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL WARNINGS:</b> This chapter contains discussion of past abuse of a minor, both physical and sexual, as well as the repercussions of that. This is all discussion of what we learned about in the last chapter. The descriptions are not explicit but may be difficult; if you'd like more details on exactly what's discussed here before you read, please feel free to leave a comment or otherwise get in touch and I'll do what I can to help. Likewise if anyone has suggestions on additional warnings/tags that I should add, please do let me know.</p>
<p>And I promise in the next part things are going to lighten up. ;D As always, a million thanks to DevilDoll for the beta, particularly with these last few chapters which were extremely difficult to write; this story would be kind of terrible without her input. :D</p>

<p>Holy pornography Batman, it's done! I want to extend my thanks again to DevilDoll for beta'ing this for me, bit by bit, and helping me retain my sanity throughout the process. Also props to abbylee for always patiently listening to me whine, and thanks again to Siess for commissioning this work of I don't even know what.</p>
<p>And thanks to all of YOU, for hanging in there and continuing to read even when you must surely have despaired of this fic ever being finished. Blessings be upon your infinite patience.</p>

<p class=""jump"">(See the end of the work for <a href=""#work_endnotes"">more notes</a>.)</p>
<p>So, I was going to have this as just two parts, but I underestimated how long it would be. See, the problem with me is that I have the entire story, from beginning to end, already written in my head before I even write my first word on paper, and my head doesn't have page numbers. So when I thought I had divided the story in half when I finished part one, I actually only had about a fourth of it down. Seriously, this next chapter is a few pages shy of being twice the length of chapter one. So it will be three chapters, instead of two. Also, I went back and fixed all the spelling and grammatical errors in the first chapter. I'm actually really embarrassed as to how many there were. I swear I proofread; I just don't always catch everything before it's published. Also, the ""&amp;"" ""g"" ""t;"" in the tags was supposed to be a greater than sign, but it didn't come out that way and whenever I try to fix it, it reorders my tags so they don't make sense. Thanks to everyone that commented, left kudos, and just plain read it!</p>

<p>When I first thought up this story, there were some things I knew that I wanted in it immediately. 1) I wanted the base story line to follow that of the original comic. There would be some things I changed for plot reasons, but the main core of it would be the same. This is both as a tribute to comic-canon, and because they did a really good job on that comic. 2) I wanted Peter's past to be leaked to the public. The reason the comic was created in the first place was to spread awareness about sexual abuse, and the prevention of it. I wanted the same thing to happen - in the Marvel Universe. By leaking it to the public, it would bring awareness. Personally, I hope that they incorporate this aspect of Spider-Man's backstory into the Tom Holland version, because the necessity to raise awareness is still there, and with Spider-Man being such a beloved aspect of Marvel, and with how many people view these films, it would spread awareness better than the comic ever did. 3) I wanted to have something else happening in the background, even if it was just a glimpse of the issue. In real life, Peter wouldn't have gotten some kind of break from the rest of the world while he dealt with this; he would still have to deal with his other problems in life no matter how difficult it got. The Sokovia Accords were an obvious choice, because that's the only thing we've seen him do in the Marvel Universe. And, before you all accuse me of being Team Cap, I'm not. I'm Team These People are All Idiots. Everyone is in the wrong. The Captain cannot just trample across borders as if they're not there - and he should know better, they still had borders in the 40s. But the Accords are so, so stupid. It doesn't matter whether or not you agree about the oversight, the Accords are still stupid, and unsustainable. It basically enslaves heroes to the whims of the panel, and tramples on Civil Rights as it does so. Since these movies started to come out, people seem to be of the opinion SHIELD or the other government organizations can wave their hands and make anything happen, regardless of laws or fundamental rights. Speaking as someone who's recently been forced to study the Supreme Court and Civil Rights cases, they can't do that and get away with it forever. I'm not a lawyer, so I apologize now for any faults in the statements made by Foggy, Matt, and Karen. They come from things I learned in AP Gov and AP US History, and also from ""Why the Sokovia Accords are Unconstitutional,"" by Legal Geeks. I don't know how to embed URLs onto this thing, so you'll just have to Google it if you want to read that. 4) I wanted to flip between Peter in present time and Peter when he was still under the control of Skip, to show the parallelism between the two. So yeah, that's why every other little segment is from the perspective of seven-year-old Peter. It is also one of the reasons this thing is so long. 5) I wanted Spider-Man's story to help people speak out. More on that next chapter. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>At long last, I have finished this. Thank you to everyone that read for their ever lasting support; I really appreciate it. Honestly, I freaked every time I got an alert about this story. It was basically me internally flailing about, mentally screaming ""I'm touching people! With words!"" as I read the amazing comments I received. I will never be able to express how grateful I am for the response this story has gotten. I have received a request for extensions on certain scenes, such as Stark firing Jameson and whatnot. There are certain events in this story that I would have loved to depict, but didn't because the story was from Peter's perspective and they occurred without him there. If y'all are interested in seeing those in an extension of this fic, like a deleted scenes type thing, let me know in the comments. If not, let me know that too. Basically, it will happen or not based on your vote. I didn't proofread this chapter as carefully as I otherwise would have, because I wanted to finally update this, so I promise I'll spend the next few days combing the chapters for all those mistakes I missed. Now, without further ado, the last chapter:</p>

</p>
<p>When I first started this, my biggest fear was that I wouldn't be able to do the subject justice. That I would start something, and entirely botch it in the process. And now, at the end, I can only hope that I didn't. I started this wanting to do the same thing that the comic did, just in a different medium. Thank you for reading, for your support and your criticism.</p>
<p>Marvel released a special edition of comics called Spider-Man and the Power Pack, where the heroes battled real-life problems in order to gain awareness with their young audience. In the very first issue, Spider-Man saves a young boy named Tony Lewis from his babysitter, Judy, who he overhears attempting to sexually assault her charge. He swings into action, scares away Judy, and convinces Tony to talk to his parents after sharing how he was assaulted by his older friend, Skip. When I read this, I immediately was shocked. Seriously, I had never heard about that aspect of Spider-Man's backstory before; it had always been just about Uncle Ben. Then, that plot-bunnies attacked and this resulted. Seriously, this adds all new dimensions to his character; I had to explore it. Much of the flashbacks is from the actual comic, and some of the dialogue comes directly from the text. I have changed a few aspects of the plot for the purposes of the story, but much of it is in its original form.</p>

<p>oh my fuck. writing is so hard. I know you all waited so long and I'm sooooo sorry because I'm an avid fanfic reader and I hate unfinished works too. My life's been a mess and it's been getting really hard to write. sometimes it just doesn't come out sounding right when you put it down on paper, y'know? i need to hire someone to yell at me to write and to stop nitpicking at every single word. BUT ANYWAY. I hope you're not too disappointed with the way the second chapter is-- the first chapter got so much love and support that i'm worried about not meeting your expectations. OTL</p>
<p>im sorry if you hate jbxjimin. i didn't tag them as a pairing because SPOILER: nothing really happens to them and they're not a romantic couple. it's not a love triangle is basically what i'm trying to say.<br>anywho, the jaemin (?) moments the fic includes are based on the moments <a href=""https://chimharem.tumblr.com/post/152658405833/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://chimharem.tumblr.com/post/152145204886/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

Or, Katara has a vision of her canon future, casts it aside, and becomes a world-changing politician instead.</p>","<p>many, many thanks to mechanical-orange for beta-ing this for me! also i haven’t read the comics and so they aren’t officially “canon” for this story, but i did pick and choose parts of them to incorporate, essentially wherever they would suit my purposes, and then discarded what didn’t.</p>
<p>okay so in truth i intended this to be a one-shot, and then it ballooned out of my control so i said it would be a three-shot and then it continued to balloon out of my control, but i truly do believe that the next part will wrap it up.</p>
<p>This chapter was hard for me to write. At first, I was too anxious about the upcoming election, and then it actually happened and I was too devastated to consider writing fanfiction. But then I stopped and thought about it, about the role of fiction in helping us -- both writer and reader -- process emotion, about how it teaches us how to get into the head of another person, about how cathartic it can be, how hopeful. And then I received a review where the person mentioned how important this story -- this Katara -- is to them, particularly after the election, how it lifted their spirits to see her being independent and strong and fearless.</p>
<p>All of this led me to restart this chapter and take it in a slightly different direction than I had planned, to delve into a lot of the things I'm feeling and I've heard from others about what they're feeling. I have, here, established a politician-Katara who stands for all that we lost on Tuesday, and who -- if she were real and living in America now -- would never for a second consider giving up. She would stand and fight and never be silenced.</p>
<p>And so I want to say -- if you're afraid right now, if you're hurting, if you're worried about the future, you are not alone. Don't give up hope, and don't lose faith. Not in yourself, and not in other other people. It seems insurmountable, it feels like things are going in an awful direction, and I'm not going to pretend that it's all magically going to be okay. But I am going to promise that you aren't alone. However alone you feel, however silenced, however afraid -- you are not alone. </p>
<p>Let us come together, let us take Katara's words to heart, and never, ever turn our backs on people who need us. We need each other now more than ever. Stand together, hang in there, and hold on. It isn't okay now, but we will make it be okay in the future. Just hold on.</p>
<p>If you ever need someone to talk to, send me a message. I can't promise that I'll have answers, but I will have a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. And never, ever, ever, ever forget, I cannot stress this enough: <b>you are not alone.</b></p>"

<p>Wow, folks, we're here, we're DONE. forgive me if i get gushy, it's 3am, this is the first fic ive put actual effort into and actually FINISHED, and i am, perhaps, a little emotional</p>
<p>first off, i need to thank aidan @riitsus one last time, and probably for the rest of eternity. talking to him was the reason i even wanted to write this in the first place, he's beta'd almost every chapter, and has blabbed with me about this enough that i really WANTED to finish it, and yknow what? he made it so much fun to write, even when i was struggling like hell with the bits i was writing. he's really an incredible friend, and i just,, yknow. thank you.</p>
<p>second, i used all of my Word Saying Things Thing actually writing this goddamn fic, so i can't actually put into words how much every single comment on this has meant to me. im, im all worded out but y'all i started this not too long after i started the school year, and every time i got an email during class and it was a comment on this, i cant even count how many times a bad day's gotten just a little bit better</p>
<p>third, on the last chapter <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/users/SmileRen/pseuds/SmileRen"" rel=""nofollow"">SmileRen</a> mentioned wishing that the kageyama bros could've bonded with kano, and it's a completely valid point. i've mentally planned out drafts of this fic where she's been more involved, where they've spoken to or relied on her more as a support, but i kinda wanted to clarify a little: i wrote this as an outsider POV fic, from the very start, and what ive found interesting in outsider POV fics has always been seeing the events of a story unfold from the perspective of someone completely separate from everything going on, and someone who is powerless to change it. to bring katsuko into the confidence of the cast and involve her in the events of the story would feel... wrong, somehow, for the kind of story i was trying to write. to some extent, katsuko is meant to represent US as an audience, watching this all happen. im sorry i didnt answer that comment directly but it felt like something perhaps important to the story itself?</p>
<p>for the record, i havent answered any comments on here bc Anxiety, but if any of y'all want to have an actual conversation or just drop in and say hi, i'm always open to chat on my tumblr @subcorax! </p>

<p>Edit 9/14/2020: I've given a lot of thought recently to deleting this fic in light of J.K. Rowling's rampant transphobia. As a non-binary creator, I feel unable to support her works in any way, as painful as that is given that, like so many of you, I grew up on Harry Potter. When a creator is still alive and profiting off of a series, and when her positions are increasingly harmful, I don't think death of the author is a sufficient justification to continue to support her work. </p>
<p>I can't say that transphobia and racism and all the other harmful ideologies that JKR has espoused recently have no place in Harry Potter, because a critical reading of Harry Potter reveals those ideologies already present in the work. I think that everyone who grew up on the series must individually grapple with that fact. However this fic in particular, like many transformative works, was written to critique the original series. As much as this was, in September of 2016, a labor of my love for the Harry Potter universe, it also represented my deep dissatisfaction with the conclusion of the series and the ways in which it failed to resolve some of the fundamental moral questions it posed. I think that many of you who have read and supported this fic over the years (and I will never cease to be surprised at the number of you) appreciate it precisely for that dissatisfaction that it articulates. Therefore, I have decided to allow this work to remain up, and I hope that it brings some degree of comfort to people who are seeking a way to still engage with Harry Potter while divorcing it from J.K. Rowling herself.</p>
<p>All Cops Are Bastards (including aurors), Black Lives Matter, Trans Rights are human rights, and fuck J.K. Rowling.</p>

<p>What, exactly, is Yuuri's true eros?</p>
<p>""He’s fourteen when he realizes two things. One, he’s very, <i>very</i> good at figure skating, and decides that it’s something he’s going to do competitively, and for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Two, Viktor realizes that he may not even have a soulmate at all.""</p>
<p>“Makkachin, is Viktor normally like this?”</p>

<p>It had taken a very surprisingly small amount of effort to convince Yuuri to go on a date with him on one of their rest days.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Yuuri had said shyly when Viktor broached the subject. “I’d like that.”</p>","<p>I have two other fics unfinished, and one of them another soulmate AU lol, but when I watched Yuri on Ice, I knew I had to have a soulmate fic for this series too!

<p>Can I just wrap you all in the warmest hug possible? Thank you to each and every one of you for reading!

<p>- how do i do this thing that leads them up to this thing that i want to write<br>-OH WAIT NO I HAVE IT:<br>- fluff<br>- ok maybe i dont have it im so lost</p>
<p>chapter 4 teaser: ask and ye shall receive. (viktor in the far distance: wow! hashtag spotlight!!)</p>
<p>This chapter was a little hard to write because we haven’t seen Viktor’s inner thoughts (and his background) at this point in the series. I could wait and wait, but I don’t want to do that to me <i>or</i> you haha. (But I’m 100% all for constantly sweet and loving viktor tho. please. the speculations are murdering my heart)</p>
<p>&amp; again thank you for reading and for all of the feedback! You are all truly incredibly sweet :’)</p>
<p>side note: LOLL one day I was minding my own business and I look down to see red ink when I hadn’t touched a red pen at all and I was like <i>”the AU has come to life”</i> and then I realized a red pen I’d accidentally left open had just gotten on me when I reached into my backpack</p>

<p>Also, like I said this was a difficult chapter, but also very important because it leads in to my Favorite Part of the plot! Are you ready?!</p>
<p>Again, I’ve seriously got to thank all of you for reading and for all the feedback!! I read each and every one of them of course, and I wish I could respond to each and every comment I’ve received like usual, but it’s the final stretch before winter break, so I’m attempting to juggle responsibilities with winding down by writing this fic. Busy busy! But I appreciate each and every one of you, and just know that every bit of feedback I get has me screaming with joy inside!! Bless this series, and bless ep 4, i love victuuri and i love yurio…</p>
<p>Also, I’m sorry for causing many of you turmoil… but <i>also</i> I probably should have clarified: I’m all for a sweet and loving Viktor, but I don’t mind a mischievously “evil” Viktor, either. ⌒(o＾▽＾o)ノ♡</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at any sort of parentlock, but I couldn't get this idea out of my head. I'm a teacher, so I figured...write what you know, haha. This is set somewhere in the United States because I'm familiar with the curriculum here. </p>
<p>I'd really like it if you readers would leave me comments about things you'd like to see happen in the story. I'm very open to suggestions! </p>
<p>I might change the rating later on, but for now it's General Audiences.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions about what you'd like to see, let me know in the comments!</p>
<p>As always, I'd love to hear about things you guys would like to see happen!</p>
<p>I swear there will be more John/Sherlock interaction next chapter. Thanks for sticking with me! I'm on vacation so the next chapter will be up on July 7th at the earliest, but probably a few days after that.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has been reading and commenting. I really appreciate the feedback!</p>

<p>This was meant to be the 'John comes to dinner' chapter but things got away from me, so that'll be in the next chapter!</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay everyone! I'm currently busy with two jobs, side projects, and moving so it makes it a little difficult to find good writing time. However, this chapter is about 1000 words longer than the longest chapter up until this point so I hope that makes up for it! </p>
<p>You can follow me on tumblr for progress updates if you like; my username is allfinehere there as well. </p>
<p>Also, <a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/users/tallenough/profile"" rel=""nofollow"">Stitchy</a> made <a href=""https://secretmanlove.tumblr.com/post/55484349375/a-lil-parentlock-doodle-inspired-by-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">art for this fic</a>! It's so adorable and I'm still freaking out about it!</p>
<p>Updates will be on Mondays from here on out, barring any unforeseen circumstances. And as always, thank you for your comments and suggestions!</p>
<p>Hey all! Thanks for picking up on the mistakes I made last chapter and letting me know. If I did any more dumb things this chapter, please tell me! And as always, if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them!</p>
<p>This chapter was kind of tough. I'm glad to be done with it and moving on!</p>
<p>Sorry everyone, this chapter's really short. Had a bit of a rough week and writing took a back seat to other things. Hopefully I can make up for it with next week's chapter!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for all your support last week; you guys are fantastic! I really appreciated all the comments and encouragement.</p>
<p>Just a reminder that I'm allfinehere on Tumblr, and I sometimes post previews and updates there.</p>
<p>Attempting to move on with the plot and not get caught up in too many little details! I don't want this to end up being a fic that drags on way too long.</p>
<p>Many apologies for not posting last week! I work two jobs so I usually write on the weekend, but I had family visiting and was participating in a craft show so I had no time to write. Hopefully in this chapter I've addressed some of the issues brought up in the comments on the last chapter. Thank you all for your continued comments and readership! You're awesome!</p>
<p>Well darlings, this chapter boosts the fic's rating to M. If you prefer not to read that sort of stuff, it's pretty obvious where it starts up so you can just skip the rest of the chapter. Any helpful suggestions for improvements are welcome!</p>
<p>In other news, I got a full-time sub job as a Kindergarten TA, which I am excited about. However, it might mean less writing time so I might miss a week here and there. You can check my tumblr (allfinehere) for posting updates.</p>
<p>Super short chapter this week because that's all I could get done.</p>
<p>EDIT: I've received lots of comments about how Thanksgiving isn't celebrated in the UK. However, this story is set in the US and we're all about the turkey over here :)</p>
<p>Once again, I just want to make sure that everyone is clear on the fact that this is an American AU. We very much celebrate Thanksgiving here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently this chapter posted 3 times, but everything's been fixed. Sorry for the confusion!</p>

<p>Apologies for the delay! I think this is the longest chapter so far, so hopefully that makes up for it :) I think next chapter will be the last one, which is a little sad but it will be nice for this to be a completed work. Thanks for sticking with me!</p>

<p>The insponsible/repossible thing actually happened in my classroom last week, in case anyone was in disbelief about it ;)</p>
<p>Also, I realize that I very conveniently got rid of Moriarty, but I just couldn't do the angst haha. So if it was too unrealistic to you, please just suspend your disbelief and look forward to the next chapter ;)</p>

<p>Kara, perhaps out of a want for thoroughness in her story, perhaps out of a Millennial-born urge to creep on a the social media of a woman she finds intriguing, discovers that Lena Luthor has a pretty active following on Instagram one afternoon not long after their first meeting. She debates it, just for a moment, before following Lena.</p>","<p>I’ve become fascinated with the bazillion versions of Krypton that exist within the world of the comics. The show’s presented us with an interesting society, one that’s got a lot of culture and passion, but also one that’s clearly rigid in its views on love and marriage. Some versions of Superman present Kryptonian relationships as ruled by the “good matches” described above and reproduction is based on compatibility within the Matrix/Codex/It’s got about 18 different names and all the wiki articles I read were confusing. I liked this but of them though, because it seemed to really jive with the non-familial relationships Kara holds closest to her within the show’s canon. Winn is incredibly smart and technically savvy, James is a well-renowned photographer with several prestigious awards, Lucy’s a high ranking military official, Cat is arguably the most powerful woman in all of popular media, and Lena, while new, also is in a position of great clout within National City. These are people who would be considered “good matches” across the board, people that Kryptonian society, as I’ve imagined it, would approve of Kara having and maintaining relationships with.</p>
<p>So this is a story that talks about Kara’s regret and grief over losing James, but also about her growing comfortable with someone else.</p>

<p>You know how I said I had ideas for a third chapter? None of them are in this chapter. I see a fourth chapter on the horizon now that wasn't there before. (It just keeps growing!)</p>
<p>Also, shout out to <b>allseer15</b> for the wonderful mental image of Newt asleep under all his magical creatures! I just had to include it. &lt;3</p>

<p>Every time I think I'm done with this story, I turn around and I've written another chapter. :) At the moment I'm not entirely sure where I'd like to go next with this, though one lovely reviewer has suggested dragons.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your continued support! You are the reason this story keeps growing!</p>
<p>This is why you never think to yourself, ""Finally, a fandom I'm not inspired to write for!"" It just provokes the plot bunnies.</p>"

Unfortunately the combination of the commute, a 9-5, and fabbo work ‘busy season’ leaves little time outside of the weekend for life’s finer pursuits (fanfic). Why, you might ask, did I embark on a 20,000+ word fic in the middle of busy season then? Good question, I have no impulse control.</p>
<p>Thank you for the frankly gorgeous comments on this fic. I am honestly blown away. I am quite concerned that I won’t quite live up to the expectations I never anticipated having!

<p>Note: Yuuri's descent into drunken disarray is unfortunately quite accurately modeled on my usual trajectory after overdoing the vodka. Including the rapid bounce back to sobriety, which gives you plenty of time to really think about all the ill-advised things you might have done.</p>
<p>Where they are flying is irrelevant to the story, mainly because I can't really justify (without significant weaseling) why they'd be flying any route that takes 25 hours. The only people flying that are Australians trying to escape their 46 degrees hellhole of a country.</p>"

<p>It shouldn't surprise Stiles when the situation quickly goes from bad to worse as the hunters throw him to a feral werewolf waiting to tear him apart.</p>
<p>Sucks that it's Derek, though.</p>","<p>I feel really bad for being so slow on finishing the second part of the ""Shakespeare Was a Wolf"" series and I am sorry to anyone who is ever so patiently waiting for it. To show how sorry I am, please have this (much shorter) Sterek story in the meantime. I am working on part two, I promise!</p>
<p>So, this story popped into my head and popped right out (in record time, no less), because my mind is often wont to wander down the path of Feral Derek. It is such an intriguing path, that one. And this story had been niggling at the back of my brain for a while now I think. Also, since I'm rewatching Teen Wolf from the beginning with my roommate, it somehow wound up being kind of set in between season one and season two?? Or something??? I'm not really sure. Let's just call it canon-divergent and leave it at that, shall we?</p>
<p>Please enjoy the story.</p>
<p>(And thank you for your patience to anyone who is waiting for the sequel to ""A Wolf By Any Other Name""!!)</p>

<p>Warnings for a view of a/b/o that involves a lot of serious discussions of whether or not consent can be granted in this sort of setting. I'm not trying to kinkshame anyone here, just exploring the concept. Plus there is a detailed description of a past rape and a suicide attempt (not in the first chapter, but later in the fic). So yeah, definitely some triggery material in here, take care of yourselves!</p>
<p>I was asked to warn about the scene where the past rape is discussed, so, that's in this chapter. To avoid it, when you get to Stiles and Derek on a stake-out, you can skip ahead, just search for the word 'dating' and it'll take you to the bit where they're talking about that. ^_^</p>
