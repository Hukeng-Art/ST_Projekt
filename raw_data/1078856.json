Thank you all so much to the readers who have enjoyed this fic over the years, and welcome to the people who are only just finding it now! I hope you'll enjoy reading it in a slightly cleaner format!</p>",
  "text": "<p>Sokka\u2019s not a stalker. He\u2019s\u00a0<em>not</em><em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>And okay, without context that did sound a bit creepy, but Jesus freakin\u2019 Christ it shouldn\u2019t matter anyway because he swears to dear god he\u2019s\u00a0<em>not a stalker \u2013\u00a0</em>no matter what Aang said, or how often he said it, or how\u00a0<em>loudly\u00a0</em>he said it because Aang was secretly a twelve year old brat at heart and didn\u2019t kiss a girl until he was fourteen and thus his opinion was invalid and \u2013\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, deep breathes and rewind.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t anything creepy, it\u2019s just that, there\u2019s this guy \u2013 and if that wasn\u2019t a phrase that pretty much defined Sokka\u2019s high school life \u2013 and yeah, okay, maybe it\u00a0<em>was</em>\u00a0a bit creepy because even Sokka admits he kind of stared too much. He didn\u2019t even know his\u00a0<em>name</em>\u00a0\u2013 just that he was tall, pale, despised coffee, liked cinnamon tea and had the sexiest scar sprawled across the left of his face.</p>\n<p>(Sokka can\u2019t help it \u2013 scars were sexy, okay?)</p>\n<p>To get back to the start of the whole stalker-not-stalker thing Sokka has going on, he should probably explain that he didn\u2019t just aggressively stalk men through facebook until they let slip their favorite drink and their preference for tea over coffee.</p>\n<p>(not often anyway; it was just that\u00a0<em>one time\u00a0</em>\u2013 and he was getting off track again.)</p>\n<p>Sokka worked at a coffee shop.</p>\n<p>Correction; he worked at\u00a0<em>Katara\u2019s\u00a0</em>coffee shop, because while Sokka had spent his high school years dicking around like the complete ass he was, Katara had grown up, gone to college and emerged with enough business know-how to drag him out of his dead-end Starbucks career track and slam him down at the counter of her own little coffee joint. It\u2019d been humiliating at first, working for his younger sister, partly out of pride but mostly out of shame because <em>he</em> was meant to take care of\u00a0<em>her\u00a0</em>and somehow, without even noticing, he\u2019d dropped the ball and now it was Katara who was looking after him. Working for his younger sister wasn\u2019t exactly how he\u2019d pictured his life going, but before she\u2019d intervened he\u2019d been working thirty hours a week at a job he hated and living off Aang\u2019s couch, so he guessed he\u2019d call it an improvement.</p>\n<p>All things considered, it was pretty alright. He just stood behind the counter flicking sugar packets at Aang while the kid pretended he was studying and made twenty or thirty non-fat, almond-milk whipped cream mocha-lattes for the parade of over-achieving arts students that swanned in with their preppy hats, band shirts and sympathy in their eyes when he passed over their drink because Sokka was the twenty-two year old drop-out who worked at his sister\u2019s shop and spent his days sprinkling chocolate on foam.</p>\n<p>And then one day that\u00a0<em>guy\u00a0</em>came in \u2013 which had been more than a little weird because\u00a0<em>Katara\u2019s Koffee\u00a0</em>had kind of adopted a selected crowd of hipsters and dead-eyed arts students and seeing somebody come in without a fedora or several copies of\u00a0<em>Nietzsche</em>\u00a0tucked under their arm was something of a bizarre sight.</p>\n<p>Aang was on break so it was just Sokka minding the counter. It had been kind of a slow morning with only a crowd of college kids tucked into a corner with their books spread all out in front of them and Sokka had always had kind of a short attention span so an anomaly in his day usually proved to brighten things up a bit.</p>\n<p>And then wow \u2013 because the closer the guy got to the counter the nicer the anomaly was looking to be because hot\u00a0<em>damn</em>, Sokka always had a thing for tall, dark and handsome and this guy was. Tall, dark and handsome, that is, not something Sokka had a\u00a0<em>thing\u00a0</em>for \u2013 he wasn\u2019t that pathetic \u2013 but\u00a0<em>wow</em>\u00a0he had functioning eyes at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey there, what can I get you?\u201d he asked, leaning nonchalantly at the counter. \u201cAnd please tell me you don\u2019t want anything with whipped cream because the kids in the corner had the last of it and I\u2019ve been too burnt out to do stock up yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>An annoyed gold eye flicked over to him from beneath a scruff of dark hair and Sokka choked aloud a little because holy flying fuck, that was one spectacular burn scar peeking out from beneath shaggy hair and the lining of a hood and Sokka wasn\u2019t exactly sure how he\u2019d missed that until he\u2019d gone and spoken and put his foot in his mouth as he always somehow managed to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Scar-face said coolly and Sokka winced. \u201cI was actually hoping for some tea; if that wasn\u2019t too much trouble for you. You do look awfully \u2018burnt out\u2019, as you said.\u201d</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t much Sokka could really say to that without sounding like an insincere jerk-off, because no matter how much the guy\u2019s tone rankled him, he\u2019d gone and stupidly blurted out something first. Deciding discretion was the better part of valor he elected to say, \u201cNo problem man, we can do tea. Anything in particular you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>A brief flash of surprise shifted across the stranger\u2019s face followed quickly by chagrin before his features fell once more back into an impassive mask. \u201cCinnamon,\u201d he said, then hesitated briefly before adding, \u201cplease.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka let out a soft\u00a0<em>whoosh</em>\u00a0of relief because he was pretty sure that was Scar-face\u2019s silent acknowledgment that he wasn\u2019t going to burn Sukko to a crisp and \u2013 sweet Jesus, he really had no brain filter at all, did he?</p>\n<p>He considered asking for a name to go with that, but this wasn\u2019t Starbucks and Katara had never been really impressed by the whole \u201cname on cup thing\u201d since the shop was so small that even rush-hour was rarely overwhelming. He bit down the impulse and turned around to the quiet little bench space away from the looming coffee machines and started putting together his drink.</p>\n<p>It was silent in the shop except for snapping of cinnamon sticks and the soft giggles of the art girls sprawled out in the corner and by the time Sokka was sliding the cup over to the counter he\u2019d started to think maybe the dude\u00a0<em>had\u00a0</em>been offended and had just decided to leave. Which would kind of piss him off because cinnamon tea was kind of bothersome to make and Sokka was kind-of-a-little lazy.</p>\n<p>Except he hadn\u2019t and was standing exactly where Sokka had left him \u2013 like there wasn\u2019t a perfectly good chair just two feet down the counter he could have sat at while waiting \u2013 and he accepted the tea stiffly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not any good, just let me know. I don\u2019t get to make it too often, so yeah.\u201d Sokka rubbed awkwardly at the back of his neck. \u201cNot a coffee fan?\u201d he asked for no other real reason than making conversation.</p>\n<p>Bright eyes flicked up to him and then back down at his drink. \u201cNo, not really, I suppose. How much do I owe you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka waved a hand as the guy reached into his pocket and stared maybe a little at the way his dark pants crinkled tightly at the front. \u201cOn the house,\u201d he said. \u201cLeast I can do for being such an ass before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scar-face blinked in surprise and seemed about to open his mouth to argue but Sokka cut him off before he could even try. \u201cDude, don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s just a cup of tea; swear to dear God I\u2019m not going to demand your first-born child in a few years for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was aiming for levity and hoping for a smile but all his words generated was a bemused sort of blink and a baffled blankness. \u201cI see\u2026 That would be\u2026 Good?\u201d Scar-face frowned slightly and it was such an effortless flow of tension that Sokka couldn\u2019t help but think he must get in a lot of practice. Without another word, he turned and strode off to the other side of the store and Sokka was so startled he didn\u2019t even remember to watch his ass as he went.</p>\n<p>Well, he blinked, that couldn\u2019t have been any weirder.</p>\n<p>He glanced over a few times during his shift to see that Scar-face had pulled out a book \u2013 soft pages folding lightly beneath long fingers and the corners rugged and dog-eared with love \u2013 and thought a few times about bringing him another cup of tea but ultimately decided it would probably be too weird and stalker-ish, and let\u2019s be honest here, he\u2019d probably just piss him off again.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later a gaggle of dark-haired girls with headphones loose around their necks bustled in and by the time Sokka looked over again, Scar-face was gone. He tried not to feel too disappointed but it was hard when he\u2019d left a twenty buck tip for a free drink.</p>\n<p>(and <em>that</em> was how it started.)</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Sokka hadn\u2019t honestly thought Scar-face would come back again.</p>\n<p>He wore nice clothes and had one color in his hair \u2013 which Sokka was pretty sure was even his natural color \u2013 and had an aloof aura that was significantly different than the nonchalant front their usual clientele tried to radiate.\u00a0<em>Katara\u2019s Koffee\u00a0</em>was nice enough, but it wasn\u2019t in a good neighborhood and it was kind of on the small side and yeah, most definitely not the kind of scene that attracted the kids who were as well-off as Scar-face looked.</p>\n<p>And if he hadn\u2019t come back, that probably would have been the end of it. Just another attractive guy Sokka had irritated by opening his mouth at all and he would have forgotten about the encounter altogether.</p>\n<p>Except Scar-face did come back. Often, actually. Usually three days a week \u2013 Monday, Wednesday and Thursday; sometimes even Sunday, but not often enough for Sokka to actually log it into his memory as a fixed \u2018Cinnamon tea\u2019 day and yeah, no wonder Aang thought it was a stalker.</p>\n<p>He ordered the same thing every time and Sokka always refused to let him pay for it and he always left a tip that was large enough to make Sokka uncomfortable but hey, it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t need the money.</p>\n<p>Sokka didn\u2019t try striking up conversation after the first horrible visit, partly because he suspected his brand of patented sarcasm wouldn\u2019t really appeal to Scar-face and partly because he suspected that any conversation\u00a0<em>at all\u00a0</em>would probably just irritate him.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t exactly sure what interested him so much about the guy because while he was good-looking, he was also kind of a jackass, and Sokka wasn\u2019t shallow enough to ride out interest on physical attraction alone. He\u00a0<em>wasn\u2019t;\u00a0</em>no matter what Katara said.</p>\n<p>He begun to sort of look forward to the days when he\u2019d come in, and sometimes he\u2019d even plan out awkward conversation starters before he figured out that \u2018<em>So,\u00a0</em>Star Wars VII<em>\u00a0\u2013 Lucas\u2019 biggest fuck up or possibly cinematic genius waiting to happen?</em>\u2019 wasn\u2019t exactly the kind of conversations someone who drank cinnamon tea and read dog-eared books in the soft rays of evening light would probably be that interested in.</p>\n<p>And then there was the whole awkward Katara thing. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Katara had noticed when he\u2019d started signing himself on for specific shifts partly because he never volunteered to work and partly because she was his sister and thus automatically psychic and privy to his every thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka looked up from where he was sprawled across the floor. It was kind of hard to see over Aang who had found a comfortable position leaning against the couch with his legs slung over Sokka\u2019s stomach as they played Mario Kart, but he could just make out Katara brandishing a sheet of paper from where she loomed in the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 The work roster?\u201d he tried, swallowing down his mouthful of marshmallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s the work roster, Sokka,\u201d she said as if he were slow. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is why you\u2019re names on here three times?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2013 shit, shit Aang, you little fucker, that was dirty \u2013 what do you mean why \u2018is my name on there three times\u2019? I\u00a0<em>work\u00a0</em>there. Remember, you \u2013 fuck,\u00a0<em>fuck</em>, drive\u00a0<em>Luigi, drive\u00a0</em>\u2013 you hired me. Pretty sure you were there for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang let out a shout of victory and nearly whacked Sokka in the chin with his foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u00a0<em>Aang would you pause that for one minute</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang \u2013 pretty much always willing to listen to Katara \u2013 sheepishly hit the pause button.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never sign up for shifts. I wasn\u2019t even aware you knew\u00a0<em>how.\u00a0</em>You usually just let me sign you on and whine when it interferes with your\u00a0<em>Dungeon and Dragons</em>\u00a0night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay first off?\u201d Sokka said as he set the controller down. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0<em>Vampire Masquerade\u00a0</em>\u2013 I don\u2019t know how many times I have to say this. Its two words guys, it\u2019s not that hard to remember. It\u2019s not my fault if you can\u2019t keep your tabletop games straight. And secondly Katara, I am frankly\u00a0<em>offended\u00a0</em>at your appraisal of my work ethic. Can\u2019t a guy try to be a hard worker without his motives being questioned? I\u2019m just thinking I should put in my hours, and, uh, do stuff, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka was a terrible liar. He knew it, Aang knew it, Katara knew it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Katara said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting all defensive \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting defensive,\u201d Sokka snapped and then pulled a face when he realized how defensive it sounded. \u201cI\u2019m just \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka has a crush on a customer,\u201d Aang blurted out like the filthy traitor he was.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my\u00a0<em>god</em>\u00a0Aang! Is\u00a0<em>nothing</em>\u00a0sacred between friends? And it\u2019s not a\u00a0<em>crush</em>\u00a0\u2013 stop saying that, it\u2019s just, do we really have to talk about this?\u201d he asked desperately but judging from the look on Katara\u2019s face, yeah, they probably really did.</p>\n<p>\u201cA crush on a\u00a0<em>customer</em>?\u201d she asked disbelievingly. \u201cHoly crap Sokka, do I have to buy you a chastity belt or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that even\u00a0<em>mean</em>?\u201d Sokka snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I just go around throwing myself at people, you know. I\u2019m not actually a dog, Katara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She frowned. \u201cThat was a bit harsh. You know I didn\u2019t mean it like that but just \u2013 Sokka,\u00a0<em>really</em>? Do you go out of your way to find the least available guys to give your heart to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an eighteenth-century romance novel,\u201d Sokka said, and yeah, his voice might have been a little high pitched but this was embarrassing and goddamn it Aang, throwing him under the bus like this just to get a favor in with Katara. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2018giving my heart\u2019 to anyone, oh my god, do I have to burn your Stephanie Myer books? It\u2019s just, there\u2019s this guy and \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Katara and Aang groaned in unison.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Aang marveled, \u201cit\u2019s started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Katara said with genuine sympathy that was frankly a little alarming. \u201cIf only you could hear yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck you both,\u201d Sokka snapped, bright red, as he flopped back down and picked up his controller again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. Aang, unpause the damn thing and I\u2019ll show you what a real racer can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang did and Katara left, but not before throwing him a sympathetic look over her shoulder. Sokka viciously stuffed another fistful of marshmallows into his mouth and pretended he wasn\u2019t as pathetic as he felt.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Sokka had so many excellent conversation ideas planned out.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d moved on from Star Wars \u2013 it was stupid to begin with anyway; even Aang didn\u2019t like to talk Star Wars with him and Aang was like his bro of bros and would probably be his brother-in-law one day at this rate \u2013 and onto bigger and better things. Like the weather. Or traffic. Maybe even the weird German guy who\u2019d started sitting at the counter four days a week. Anything that didn\u2019t give away Sokka\u2019s raging nerdhood and his borderline creepy interest.</p>\n<p>What actually came out of his mouth one day as he was handing over his tea was: \u201cSo what\u2019s your name anyway? It\u2019s a little distracting calling you Scar-face all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh my god,</em> Sokka thought as his teeth slammed down hard on his lip<em>. Smooth, soldier. Real smooth. And probably seven different kinds of offensive too.</em></p>\n<p>Scar-face, to his credit, didn\u2019t do much more than blink awkwardly at him, like he was unsure Sokka had even spoken at all \u2013 which was a step up from throwing his scalding drink in his face, but a step or two below suave conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy \u2013 what? My\u00a0<em>name</em>?\u201d \u00a0He sounded almost as incredulous as he looked.</p>\n<p>And okay yeah, this was awkward but Sokka saw things through once he started so he settled for an exasperated eye roll and prayed the Scar-face thing had slipped by him because\u00a0<em>awkward</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, your name? The little thing that people scream on the streets when they want your attention? You\u2019ve been a regular for like \u2013 what? Three weeks now? It just feels weird not having anything to call you when you come up in passing conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scar-face\u2019s expression came even more confused. \u201cI\u2026 I come up in passing conversation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh shit.</p>\n<p>Sokka flushed bright red. \u201cNot like anything special. Don\u2019t go getting all big-headed. Fredrick over there comes up in passing conversation now and then too,\u201d he said nodding to the weird German guy over at the counter edge even though he didn\u2019t have a fucking clue what his name was although he was eighty-percent certain it probably wasn\u2019t Fredrick.</p>\n<p>If anything, Scar-face just looked more weirded out and Sokka was so glad Aang wasn\u2019t here to witness his moment of shame because this was humiliating.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko,\u201d he said after a moment and it took Sokka a whole ten seconds to realize he meant his\u00a0<em>name</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko,\u201d he repeated and gave him a winning smile. \u201cAwesome, got a z in it, won\u2019t go forgetting that anytime soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scar-face \u2013 Zuko, Sokka corrected himself and tried not to smile like a teenage girl \u2013 shifted uncomfortably and Sokka waited patiently for him to turn and flee back to his designated little corner by the window. Instead he hesitated a moment and set his cup back down at the counter and took a seat.</p>\n<p>Sokka was so busy outright staring in surprise that he missed whatever words it was Zuko\u2019s mouth was forming. He blinked. \u201cWait, sorry. What was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s mouth twitched almost like a smile but more closely resembling a smirk. \u201cI said you?\u201d He gestured towards Sokka\u2019s apron. \u201cYou don\u2019t wear a name-tag.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sokka said as his fingers fluttered up to his bare apron. \u201cUm, yeah. Lost it. I\u2019m pretty good at that. Katara\u2019s still too pissed to order me a new one. It\u2019s Sokka.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka,\u201d Zuko repeated and the sound of his name rolling off that tongue was almost enough to make him shiver like he was sixteen again. \u201cKatara?\u201d he said next, frowning slightly. \u201cAs in the owner of\u00a0<em>Katara\u2019s Koffee</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne and same. She\u2019s my sister. Gave me a job to stop me from being a useless shit; didn\u2019t work, but points to her for trying. She likes to pretend that if she just acts like I\u2019m not an embarrassment we won\u2019t be related anymore. I could have told her that doesn\u2019t work; I\u2019ve been trying since she turned twelve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko actually\u00a0<em>laughed</em>. It wasn\u2019t loud or quiet or anything too extraordinary; just a puff of air and a surprised chuckle like he hadn\u2019t figured Sokka to be quite so mouthy but it\u00a0<em>did\u00a0</em>things to him because two days ago they hadn\u2019t even really spoken and now Sokka was making Zuko laugh and he knew his name and \u2013 woah there cowboy, better slow down before you do something dumb like ask for his number.</p>\n<p>Sokka grinned though, still pleased all the same at the response before scrubbing half-heartedly at a smudge of coffee on the counter. \u201cHow about you big-shot? Got any sisters wishing you into non-existence?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cBig-shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Sokka deadpanned, waving a hand at the nice coat and the nice shirt and really, the nice everything. \u201cAnybody who doesn\u2019t buy their clothes from a discount retailer is a big-shot. Learn your facts, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anybody else might have been offended, but Zuko\u2019s eyebrows just climbed a little higher and he took a sip of his tea before giving a mild shrug. \u201cMy family does okay,\u201d he said, but a little uneasily like he didn\u2019t really want to talk about it before adding quickly, like he wanted to change the subject, \u201cI have a sister. One.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHot damn,\u201d Sokka said, easily ignoring Zuko\u2019s clear discomfort about the previous topic. \u201cShe got the whole charming pale-and-black thing going on there too? Is it a family thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko snorted. \u201cI could ask that of you. Does your sister look anything like you? If so, my condolences to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u00a0<em>you\u00a0</em>are not funny,\u201d Sokka said, jabbing a finger at Zuko. \u201cLeave the jokes up to the professionals before you hurt yourself, pretty boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko raised an eyebrow. \u201cPretty boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not \u2013 you know what I mean,\u201d Sokka spluttered a bit uselessly as Zuko laughed at his clear embarrassment. \u201cYou are the worst. I don\u2019t know why I ever thought it\u2019d be a good idea to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to talk to me?\u201d Zuko asked, clearly surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, duh,\u00a0<em>yeah</em>. I don\u2019t just ask the names of everyone who comes in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you wanted my name because I came up in passing conversation?\u201d Zuko said and he looked half amused and half\u00a0<em>confused</em>. Sokka had that effect on lot of people.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat too,\u201d he said because it was the easier thing to say. \u201cBut like, yeah. I\u2019m not a stalker, don\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Probably.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Zuko blinked before adding, clearly rushed, \u201cI wanted to talk to you, too. To apologize for the first day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka paused for a moment and\u00a0<em>stared</em>. \u201cApologize? What\u00a0<em>for</em>? I was the one who went and said something really stupid. If anything, I should be apologizing to\u00a0<em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Zuko hesitated for a second, long fingers curling warm around his tea. \u201cIt\u2019s no excuse for how rude I acted afterwards, especially seeing as how you\u2019ve gone out of your way to make me feel welcome since.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just some free tea, man,\u201d Sokka said awkwardly as his face heated up. \u201cLet\u2019s not go getting all sentimental over a few sticks of cinnamon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko actually cracked a smile at that and\u00a0<em>god</em>, was that a face designed for smiling. It was a bit awkward around the edges, a little bit unsure, a tad defensive even, like Sokka might call him out on it, but it was an honest-to-god smile.</p>\n<p>They talked for the next hour or so, and when a crush of students poured in to steal Sokka\u2019s attention, Zuko actually said goodbye before he left.</p>\n<p>Sokka was actually doomed.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you going to ask him out?\u201d Aang asked the next day while Sokka scrubbed at the counter and Aang pretended like he was doing his gender studies work on the opposite side of the bench.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you mean,\u201d Sokka said with as much dignity as he could muster. Aang raised an eyebrow at him which was always something that tended to look a little weird on somebody with as little hair as Aang had.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, nobody. Just that guy in the corner you\u2019ve been staring at for the past half hour. I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume he\u2019s \u2018the guy\u2019 that you\u2019ve been waxing poetry about for the past month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould be you quieter?\u201d Sokka hissed under his breath as he shot a concerned glance to the corner that Zuko was sitting in. He didn\u2019t appear to have heard anything, however, and just calmly turned a page in his book and took another sip of his tea. Sokka breathed out a sigh of relief and shot Aang a nasty look. \u201cI haven\u2019t been waxing anything about anyone, okay? And I keep saying it\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s just really interesting, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you just admit you like him?\u201d Aang asked looking honestly baffled as he sat aside his pen and gave up all pretense of studying which meant he was in his Definitely Very Serious mood.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to admit,\u201d Sokka said through gritted teeth. \u201cHi, welcome to\u00a0<em>Katara\u2019s Koffee</em>; what can I get you today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang waited patiently for Sokka to serve off a few hot chocolates to the giggly high school girls that kept looking at him out of the corner of their eyes. Dude was impervious to anybody who wasn\u2019t Katara, really. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s the worst that could happen from saying it aloud?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could lose my dignity? My self-respect? My reason\u00a0<em>to live</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being dramatic,\u201d Aang scolded and it was\u00a0<em>weird</em>. When did it reach a part in his life where it was okay for Aang to scold him for being stupid? Kid still couldn\u2019t even legally drink.</p>\n<p>Sokka sighed and\u00a0<em>thunked</em>\u00a0the rag he was wiping the counter with down. \u201cJust let it go, Aang,\u201d he said tiredly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Aang stubbornly because he could be perceptive at the worst of times. \u201cNot until you tell me why you won\u2019t admit you like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause, because\u2026 oh my god, I can\u2019t believe you need me to say this<em>\u00a0aloud</em>.\u201d Sokka winced. \u201cJust\u2026 Just\u00a0<em>look at him</em>.\u201d He gestured over to where Zuko was sitting, back turned to them. Aang gave him a concerned look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s way out of my league,\u201d Sokka snapped. \u201cOkay? Are you happy now? People like\u00a0<em>that</em>\u00a0don\u2019t wind up with people like\u00a0<em>this</em>\u00a0by any stretch of imagination.\u201d He waved a hand in front of himself. \u201cI mean, yeah, I\u2019m pretty fucking fine, don\u2019t get me wrong, but\u2026 it\u2019s just not happening, Aang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think that?\u201d Aang asked, looking crestfallen.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>, I really think that. So thanks for making me so it. Are we done? Shut up and do your homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang did go silent and do his homework after that, biting his lip and casting concerned glances at Sokka all the while.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t speak again.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Sokka managed to keep his raging crush to himself for nearly a week after that. Which, all things considered, was something of a personal record for him.</p>\n<p>It was late on a Thursday evening and Sokka was alone closing up shop. The last of the customers had trickled out fifteen minutes ago and he had his earphones in and was humming along to a rousing rendition of nothing in particular which was why it took him so long to realize that the shop wasn\u2019t empty after all.</p>\n<p>Zuko was sitting over in a nook just behind the counter, completely different from his usual place. Sokka paused, chair half in his hands and half resting on the table he was setting it on. He\u2019d thought Zuko had left hours ago because, well, he wasn\u2019t sitting over where he normally sat.</p>\n<p>It was\u00a0<em>strange,\u00a0</em>okay?</p>\n<p>He hesitated for a moment, considering him. Zuko wasn\u2019t reading a book this time. Instead he was typing at a laptop, brow creased unfavorably and tea forgotten by his elbow. He looked pretty stressed.</p>\n<p>Sokka stared for a moment longer before coming to his decision. He turned around and continued closing up, putting chairs on tables and pulling blinds closed. He went slower than usual, but he still finished in only a matter of ten minutes or so. When he turned back, Zuko was still sitting in the corner and showing no signs of moving.</p>\n<p>He had a\u00a0<em>Vampire Masquerade\u00a0</em>game scheduled for tonight. He had to be at Haru\u2019s in under an hour. He hesitated.</p>\n<p>Zuko did look really stressed.</p>\n<p>In the end, there wasn\u2019t even a decision to make. Sokka sighed and headed back behind the counter to make another cup of cinnamon tea, pulling out his phone and dialing absently at he went.</p>\n<p>By the time he had the game rescheduled for the night after next, he\u2019d set the fresh cup of tea down at the table with Zuko and taken the empty cup into the back. Zuko didn\u2019t even look up from his typing and Sokka couldn\u2019t stop the fond smile from pulling at his lips even though he really was kind of worried for the intensity with which Zuko was focused on his computer.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t like it was exactly a hardship for Sokka to stay behind. Yeah, he\u2019d miss his RP session with the guys, but it wasn\u2019t like they didn\u2019t understand. It was a good chance to get some of the stock reports Katara had been nagging him for done, and he couldn\u2019t fault the view tucked behind the counter with Zuko\u2019s serious face to glance at from time to time when he got bored of numbers.</p>\n<p>In the end, Sokka did wind up getting sucked into his work. He\u2019d never had a great head for math, but when he hit a rhythm in his work he could go for hours. He was just working out how much they were short by this week when a shadow fell over him and Sokka looked up to see Zuko standing on the opposite side of the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said in surprise and offered him a grin as he pulled his earphones out, cutting off Freddie Mercury\u2019s explanation as to why love wasn\u2019t so crash hot anyway. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t see you there for a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko had the oddest look on his face as he stared at him. Sokka frowned. \u201cWhat? Is there something on my face? Oh my god, it was probably Aang, that\u00a0<em>bastard\u00a0</em>\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s ranting seemed to jerk Zuko out of whatever trance he was in because he blinked and then said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d he paused again. \u201cIt\u2019s eleven-thirty,\u201d he said uncertainly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d Sokka marveled because holy crap time could fly. \u201cThat late already?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou close at nine,\u201d Zuko said and yeah, he was definitely frowning now.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Sokka said intelligibly, \u201cYeah. I did close hours ago. You just looked like you needed to\u2026\u201d he waved a hand over to where Zuko\u2019s laptop still stood open. \u201cKeep doing whatever you were doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko was still looking at him like he\u2019d never seen him before in his life and Sokka flushed, suddenly wondering if he\u2019d overstepped his bounds, if maybe the whole thing had come off as creepy rather than just casually concerned. \u201cSorry, I, uh, I didn\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable or anything,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Zuko was still looking at him blankly. \u201cSo you just\u2026 stayed behind so as not to bother me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka cringed because it hadn\u2019t seemed like such a big deal until Zuko had gone and pointed it out. \u201cPretty much, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor two and a half hours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, to be fair, numbers are really fucking fascinating, okay? Not my fault I got sucked into the whole stock counting thing. You should try it. Very therapeutic.\u201d It was complete bullshit but the way Zuko just kept\u00a0<em>staring\u00a0</em>at him was making him seriously nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Zuko said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to impose or \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, dude, trust me. It was no imposition,\u201d Sokka said, relieved to finally have something to say that had a basis in sanity. \u201cI had stuff to do anyway, and you looked like you were on a role. If you didn\u2019t even notice when I dropped a chair in the middle of close, you definitely needed to keep doing whatever it was you were doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko looked so baffled that Sokka was honestly confused. Had he really never had anyone do something that simple for him before?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2013\u201d Zuko started to say before stopping and starting again. \u201cWould you like a lift home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka blinked at him. \u201cLike, with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded stiffly. \u201cIt\u2019s late. It\u2019s not really safe to walk home at this hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka blinked again. \u201cHow do you know I walk?\u201d he asked, viciously, terribly confused. The back of Zuko\u2019s neck looked like it might have reddened slightly and he very carefully avoided Sokka\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you walking by in the evenings sometimes. I\u2019d previously considered offering you a lift, but you seemed, uh, distracted.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took everything Sokka had not to turn bright red because he was fully aware that his walks home generally consisted of listening to his music louder than was probably healthy and dancing his way down the street like he thought he was Shakira. \u201cOh,\u201d he said faintly, and wondered if he could chance an attempt at drowning in the sink. \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cSo is that a yes to a lift home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, only if I\u2019m not out of your way or anything,\u201d he said blankly because this was all a bit fucking strange and he wasn\u2019t entirely convinced he hadn\u2019t just dreamt all of this up.</p>\n<p>Zuko smiled and Sokka\u2019s heart did something that probably would have qualified it for the Russian Olympic gymnastics team. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter everything you\u2019ve done for me, it\u2019s the least I can offer in return. Just give me a moment to pack up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Sokka said and could only watch blankly as Zuko packed away his laptop and belongings with ease.</p>\n<p>He slipped the reports he\u2019d finished under the register for Katara to find in the morning and ducked in back to take off his apron and grab his bag. When he came back out, Zuko was waiting for him patiently by the door. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s car was a smooth black thing that looked like it probably cost more than his yearly rent. He was half completely and utterly impressed, and half horrified about the smell of coffee he was probably going to leave clinging to the upholstery as he climbed delicately into the passenger seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to break it, you know,\u201d Zuko said, amused. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s designed to hold your scrawny weight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shut up captain muscles,\u201d Sokka snapped as gingerly pulled the door closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cCaptain muscles?\u201d Zuko repeated and Sokka really wished he could think before opening his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, would you just drive already,\u201d he moaned and Zuko obliged with a light snicker.</p>\n<p>It was much warmer in the car than it had been outside, but Sokka shivered a bit through his thin shirt and was absurdly touched when Zuko directed all the heat vents towards him without so much as a word. Dude was totally not helping Sokka get over his absurd crush though.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Zuko asked and it took Sokka a moment to realize he meant his address.</p>\n<p>Sokka rattled off his address and watched as Zuko\u2019s fingers easily turned the wheel beneath his sure and confident grip. Hands like that should be illegal on a man.</p>\n<p>Sokka quickly turned his attention to the window before he got caught staring and pulled at his short ponytail with his fingers. It was coming loose and he tugged it free easily, sticking the band between his teeth as he brushed his fingers through his hair with an irritated sigh. He was pretty sure he felt the faintest slick of cream in there from a handsy toddler. By god, did he hate children.</p>\n<p>Zuko made a sound from the driver\u2019s seat and Sokka looked over as tugged his hair back up. He was staring straight ahead at the road, fingers tight on the wheel. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Sokka asked around the band in his mouth, before making a face and using his teeth to tug it over his wrist instead. \u201cYou doing okay, big guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko shook his head. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said with the faintest strain in his voice. He cleared his throat. \u201cYour hair looks nice like that. Down, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka blinked. Did Zuko just compliment him?</p>\n<p>Heat flooded through his face in an instant and he worked to school his face into a smirk that didn\u2019t make him look like a lovestruck puppy. \u201cI could leave it down if you\u2019d prefer,\u201d he said because flirting was kind of his default when he didn\u2019t know what the hell to say.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s fingers seemed to flex on the steering wheel. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out,\u201d he hedged, which made absolutely no sense to Sokka, but his brain was still a bit fried from the compliment. Zuko slid a sidelong glance at him, burnished brown darting over to peer at him from beneath a fan of dark lashes. \u201cIt\u2019d probably be\u2026 warmer to leave it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka swallowed and thought through a hazy fog,\u00a0<em>bullshit</em>.</p>\n<p>Something sat heavy and thick in his gut and he was pretty certain he wasn\u2019t imagining the crackling tension in the car. He was suddenly conscious of his breathing, the way it sounded loud and rough in the air. He cleared his throat. \u201cYeah,\u201d he rasped, \u201cI, um, I\u2019ll do that. Leave it out, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko turned the wheel easily and didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and Sokka\u2019s brain short circuited because what did that even\u00a0<em>mean?</em></p>\n<p>There was the crunch of road giving way to gravel and Sokka glanced up in surprise as he realized they were pulling up by the drive of his apartment complex. He\u2019d known it\u2019d be a short ride \u2013 it was within reasonable walking distance after all \u2013 and he couldn\u2019t honestly say he wasn\u2019t glad for it. Being stuck in close quarters when Zuko was in such a strange mood spouting things about his hair and looking at him like that, like he\u00a0<em>mattered\u00a0</em>- Christ.</p>\n<p>Sokka was broken. Undeniably, irreversibly broken, because he was doing so\u00a0<em>good\u00a0</em>at pretending like he didn\u2019t notice the little things like the fact Zuko\u2019s eyes were more gold than brown or the way his collarbone dipped in a pale slide of skin and bone beneath the neck of his shirt but then Zuko had to go and say stupid things and give him\u00a0<em>hope\u00a0</em>and that was just too cruel.</p>\n<p>Sokka dragged in a deep breath and unclicked his seatbelt with thick, clumsy fingers. \u201cUh, thanks for the ride, man. I\u2019d say I owe you one, but we\u2019ll just consider this as an advance on all your future cinnamon teas,\u201d he said as steadily as he could manage. He fumbled for the door handle and pasted a frankly shitty excuse for a smile on his lips.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s hands rested lightly on the wheel, the car still thrumming beneath them. He wasn\u2019t even looking at Sokka and his heart sunk a little bit, because he so desperately wanted just the briefest glance of his eyes, his mouth,\u00a0<em>his scar\u00a0</em>\u2013 anything to assure him that this was Zuko sitting here with him in this weirdly electric moment before he opened the door and it was lost to the chill of night air.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Sokka said intelligibly and he really should\u00a0<em>just leave</em>, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you Monday then.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That\u00a0</em>got Zuko\u2019s attention, his eyes flicked up quick as you like and his lips parted just lightly in surprise<em>. </em>And then Sokka realized what he \u2013 in his moment of infinite wisdom \u2013 had said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d he breathed as Zuko\u2019s eyes remained locked with his own and Sokka knew in instance with the way they widened and his mouth dropped, fingers slacking on the wheel, that whatever he saw in Sokka\u2019s expression meant there was probably no talking his way out of this one.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sokka had just gone and revealed his complete infatuation and he\u2019d ruined everything, and oh god, what was he going to do without the smell of cinnamon and sugar and Zuko was, Zuko was -</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko was unclicking his seatbelt and before Sokka could really think about what was happening there was a hand on the back of his neck pulling him forward and he was being kissed deeply and messily, pressed back into his seat with Zuko\u2019s hand hot on his skin, lips pushing at his own.</p>\n<p>He reacted on instinct \u2013 because\u00a0<em>fuck, fuck, fuck;\u00a0</em>this couldn\u2019t possibly be actually happening \u2013 fingers wrapping around Zuko\u2019s biceps, curling over thick flexing muscles and hot skin and kissing back with all the energy he had, taking the kiss deeper and further and making it as filthy as he could make it as quick as he could because he might only get one chance at this and then \u2013</p>\n<p>Zuko groaned into his mouth \u2013 an honest to god <em>groan</em> \u2013 and Sokka\u2019s stomach flipped at the thought that\u00a0<em>he\u00a0</em>was doing that to him and he wrapped his arms around Zuko\u2019s shoulders to pull him in further until he was pretty much on top of him.</p>\n<p>It should have been awkward. The front seat of a car really wasn\u2019t made with this sort of activity in mind \u2013 design error, Sokka should complain \u2013 and in any other circumstance it would be. There was a gear stick digging into his side and Zuko couldn\u2019t possibly be comfortable with the way Sokka had all but hauled him over the center console, but Sokka really couldn\u2019t be fucked to waste vital brain space on things like\u00a0<em>comfort\u00a0</em>or\u00a0<em>awkward\u00a0</em>right now.</p>\n<p>The kiss turned open mouth and the kind of desperately messy though Sokka had thought he was done with in highschool \u2013 so very fucking wrong he was then, because the way Zuko\u2019s tongue felt as it licked inside in his mouth should be illegal.</p>\n<p>Sokka didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been this aroused in all his life because just\u00a0<em>kissing\u00a0</em>Zuko was better than any sex he\u2019d had with anyone\u00a0<em>ever\u00a0</em>and he didn\u2019t think he wanted to do anything ever again in his life.</p>\n<p>Zuko pulled away and Sokka tried to follow him up only to have on hand sprawl across his stomach and push him back into his seat as lips mouthed down his throat. \u201c<em>Sokka</em>,\u201d Zuko breathed against his skin and Sokka couldn\u2019t help the ragged gasp that tore itself from his mouth, fisting one hand in Zuko\u2019s shirt as he \u2013</p>\n<p>A sharp rapping came from the window, knuckles knocking hand against glass, and Sokka\u2019s eyes flashed open and Zuko was hauling himself up and \u2013 fuck no \u2013\u00a0<em>off\u00a0</em>of him and unwinding the window with a steady finger on one button.</p>\n<p>Sokka flung himself desperately back into his seat ad tried not to look like he\u2019d been about to engage in anything dubious, shoving a fist against his mouth to muffle the way his breath came in uneven pants and shifting uneasily in the seat because there was no was in hell he could have Zuko sprawled across him like that and not get a little hard.</p>\n<p>The face that appeared in the window was that of Mrs. Shoddery; the woman who lived two doors down from Sokka and was looking in on them with a mixture of concern and suspicion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you boys okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been stalled here an awful long while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka worked to contain a hysterical giggle. They\u2019d been doing more than okay until she\u2019d gone and ruined it all.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry Ma\u2019am,\u201d Zuko said, and how he managed to sound so smooth and apologetic when he\u2019d had his tongue down Sokka\u2019s throat a moment ago, he\u2019d never know. \u201cWe were just discussing something and \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013 we\u2019re done now,\u201d Sokka interjected as he scrambled one-handed for the bag by his feet, the fingers on the other hand finally catching on the door handle. \u201cThanks-for-the-lift-Zuko-bye.\u201d</p>\n<p>He catapulted himself out of the car and slammed the door behind him, catching only the briefest glance of the complete surprise on Zuko\u2019s face before the tinted passenger window blocked him from view.</p>\n<p><em>Oh good,</em> Sokka thought a little deliriously, <em>at least Mrs. Shoddery will never know exactly what it was that was happening in there.</em></p>\n<p>He turned and fled up to his apartment.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The next day at work was hell.</p>\n<p>If Sokka was still working at Starbucks, he probably would have called in sick. Unfortunately stunts like that were considerably harder to get away with when your own flesh and blood was your manager. He didn\u2019t quite know how he did it, but he got himself out of bed \u2013 not like he\u2019d really slept, replaying the smooth glide of Zuko\u2019s lips and the careless slide of his hands \u2013 and into work just on time.</p>\n<p>Sokka spent the day fumbling mugs and spilling coffee beans. He was lucky he was the only person working. He could just imagine Katara\u2019s face if she\u2019d seen him spill the sugar-packet holder for the third time.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d made out with Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Zuko had made out with\u00a0<em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>Sokka took in a deep shuddering breath and focused on scrubbing the counter with more vigor than was probably advisable considering its ability to absorb water like a sponge.</p>\n<p>There had been making out and hands and Sokka was absolutely certain he hadn\u2019t imagined the way Zuko\u2019s fingers has fluttered along the inseam of his pants, flitting dangerously upwards.</p>\n<p>Sokka probably would have blown him in the car without a second thought if those fingers had just inched a little higher.</p>\n<p>Fucking Christ, Sokka couldn\u2019t stop his fingers from shaking. He was going to drive himself insane at this rate and it wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d even really\u00a0<em>done</em>\u00a0anything. He was a twenty-two year old man; he absolutely could handle a little bit of making out and backseat fumbling without turning into a fucking Disney princess about the whole thing.</p>\n<p>Except for the fact he really couldn\u2019t, apparently, because every time the bell rang he couldn\u2019t stop himself from looking up with the faintest flicker of hope skittering like nerves down his spine even though it was only Friday and Zuko had never been in a Friday in his life.</p>\n<p>It was just\u2026 Zuko was unobtainable. He came into the shop and sat by the full-wall window to read books \u2013 pages worn thin with love \u2013and drank cinnamon tea and made Sokka\u2019s heart stutter just by\u00a0<em>being there\u00a0</em>with his gorgeous face and gorgeous arms and stupidly gorgeous\u00a0<em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Sokka was an expert at lusting after things he could not have. He had it down to a fine art, nearly. He\u2019d been all but prepared to hopelessly moon after him for the rest of eternity, because that\u2019s what guys like Sokka\u00a0<em>did</em>.</p>\n<p>Only Zuko had kissed him like he\u2019d been craving it and Sokka could cry because now he had no fucking clue where that left them only that he\u2019d had the hottest guy in the Northern hemisphere all but in his lap yesterday and he really wouldn\u2019t be opposed to doing it again.</p>\n<p>When Suki came into relive him off his shift at three o\u2019clock, she frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you looking constipated?\u201d she asked with all her usual tact. \u201cI know you\u2019re not a fan of the morning shift, but you don\u2019t usually look like you can\u2019t decide whether to throw yourself off a cliff or cry in the corner like a little boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sokka blinked, because he hadn\u2019t thought his inner turmoil was that obvious.</p>\n<p>She flapped a hand at him as he undid the knot around his waist. \u201cYou\u2019re distracted. Now, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re usually a down to earth person or anything, but something must be up to have you as covered in coffee stains as you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka made a noise at the back of his throat and focused on hanging up his apron. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said, not looking at her even though he could feel her doubtful gaze boring like a drill in the back of his skull. He fussed with his jacket, pulling it on deliberately slowly like she might just drop it if he appeared immersed in the task.</p>\n<p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s that guy isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka whirled around spluttering wordlessly, because Jesus Christ, who the fuck keeps telling people about these things? Is Sokka not allowed one little romantic crisis without it becoming water-cooler fodder for anybody and everybody even remotely involved in his life?</p>\n<p>While he wasn\u2019t quite able to verbalize everything he wanted to, something must have shown through in his expression for Suki\u2019s face softened slightly. \u201cYou can relax. I\u2019m not going to tell you my opinion on the whole debacle \u2013 although if Toph is to be believed, you\u2019re star crossed lovers who are planning a Romeo and Juliet to escape the disapproval of your families.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Sokka breathed, burying his face into his hands, because at this point he didn\u2019t even know who to blame for the fact that his romantic life was apparently a daily soap for his friends. Suki snorted in sympathy.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201chypothetically, if I\u00a0<em>were</em>\u00a0to give you my opinion on the whole debacle \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013I don\u2019t really want to \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013 I\u2019d\u00a0<em>say</em>,\u201d she continued, like Sokka hadn\u2019t cut over her at all, \u201cJump that boy\u2019s bones and be done with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Sokka said furtively as he stalked towards the door. \u201cI hate you all.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Sokka used his weekend off to viciously repress anything related in any way, shape or form to the mess that was his romantic life.</p>\n<p>He kicked off Saturday with a Buffy marathon and a tub of icecream before having Aang over for a few rounds of anything that had a multiplayer function. They ordered pizza and Sokka schooled his ass in Street Fighter. Aang wound up crashing for the night, which suited Sokka just fine as he really needed the distraction.</p>\n<p>If Aang picked up on his near desperate will not to be left alone, he graciously didn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>When Aang left Sunday Sokka headed over to Haru\u2019s for the game of\u00a0<em>Vampire Masquerade\u00a0</em>that he\u2019d been forced to postpone the other night when \u2013 no, that\u2019s not the line of thinking that Sokka wanted his brain going down right now.</p>\n<p>Anyway, he headed over to Haru\u2019s for a game of\u00a0<em>Vampire Masquerade</em>\u00a0in which his Malkavian kicked some serious butt. Sokka focused as hard as he could on being the biggest nerd he could possibly be, which really shouldn\u2019t have been as difficult as it was seeing as how Sokka\u2019s entire life had been a complete and utter nerdery. His first boyfriend had been a Dungeon Master at the local hobby shop. Seriously.</p>\n<p>None of the guys asked why Sokka was viciously murdering any characters they came across like it was his due. They were great like that.</p>\n<p>By the time Sokka got home that evening he\u2019d done such a good job at just ignoring his problems and hoping they\u2019d go away that he almost had a panic attack at the realization that Monday was in less than two hours and providing he hadn\u2019t scared him off, Zuko would be back.</p>\n<p>And oh god. What if he\u00a0<em>did\u00a0</em>scare him off? What if while Sokka had been busy swooning over the whole yours-mine-and-ours possibility looming on the horizon that making out with somebody with whom you\u2019d been getting along with seemed to imply, Zuko had just shrugged and thought\u00a0<em>thanks, no thanks</em>.</p>\n<p>Sokka had to sit down and tell himself to breath.</p>\n<p>This whole thing had spiraled out of control. It was meant to be a crush on a cute guy who had managed to pique his interest. That was all. Somewhere along the line while Sokka wasn\u2019t paying attention, it had gone to hell and now he was sitting alone in the fucking dark at midnight contemplating his life choices.</p>\n<p>He was more than a little gone on the bastard, and he figured maybe this was what Katara and Aang had been trying to warn him about all along.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, he thought as his folded his fingers into a fist. Tomorrow everything would become clear.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Everything was not clear. Everything was fucking chaos.</p>\n<p>Sokka had been so distracted, completely wrapped up in his own little world of Zuko, Zuko,\u00a0<em>Zuko\u00a0</em>that he\u2019d completely forgotten that life didn\u2019t just stop for the whims of mortal men.</p>\n<p>It was the start of the holiday period and even though\u00a0<em>Katara\u2019s Koffee\u00a0</em>was small and empty and not in the best neighborhood, the day classes let out usually meant the biggest inpouring of business they\u2019d see all year.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the fuck is Yue?\u201d Sokka snapped as Suki swept past with a tray carefully balancing several drinks. He could barely hear her answer over the sheer crowd noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Suki growled as the press of people around her nearly sent the drinks toppling to the floor. \u201cI can barely see myself in this crowd, and you expect me to keep an eye out for somebody else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka would have argued but it was\u00a0<em>packed\u00a0</em>and he couldn\u2019t just stand around arguing with people, he had to get actual shit done.</p>\n<p>The constant ebb and flow of the customers meant that he really couldn\u2019t keep an eye out for Zuko. Not that it really mattered anyway. Zuko would probably take one look at the amount of people crammed in and turn around and leave out of sheer horror.</p>\n<p>Things didn\u2019t slow down until about six in the evening when most of the excitement of being let free from their respective education systems had abated enough to allow the shambles of students to leave and go do whatever it was students did when they weren\u2019t studying or cramming themselves into Sokka\u2019s coffee shop. As the numbers dwindled down to the spare two or three customers, Sokka allowed himself to look to the door again and hope.</p>\n<p>But six became seven, and seven became eight and suddenly the shop was empty, it was time to close and Sokka was all alone at the front counter with fingers tight around the grip of a mug and something bitter like disappointment hot against the back of his tongue.</p>\n<p>Zuko had never missed a Monday before Sokka had to go and open his big mouth.</p>\n<p>Sokka cleaned with unnecessary attention, slamming mugs and cups away like they\u2019d done him a personal wrong and scrubbing at tables so hard it was amazing he didn\u2019t wear the cloth to scrap.</p>\n<p>He was starting to wonder if maybe Zuko hadn\u2019t seemed as involved as he\u2019d thought that night in the car. If maybe it was his mind twisting things just because that was how he\u00a0<em>wanted\u00a0</em>it to seem. There was no denying Zuko\u2019s mouth had been on his, his hand low on his thigh.\u00a0<em>That,\u00a0</em>at the very least, had happened. But Sokka couldn\u2019t help but wonder if maybe he\u2019d just imagined the way his breath had hitched when he kissed back, if maybe those fingers hadn\u2019t been gripping quite as tightly as he remembered. If maybe the look he\u2019d seen fluttering across that face when he\u2019d hauled him closer was more shock than arousal.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s face was burning with something that was a mix of humiliation and dread.</p>\n<p>Okay. So maybe Zuko wasn\u2019t that interested in him. Or maybe he\u2019d been looking for a quick fling only to be completely turned off from pursing the idea when Sokka bolted from the car like a madman. Maybe, if he were lucky, Zuko would come in at his usual time tomorrow and sit at his usual table, order his usual tea and the two of them could just pretend the whole thing never happened.</p>\n<p>Sokka sighed and ran a hand over his face, suddenly feeling limp and devoid of energy. He was tired. He couldn\u2019t think about this right now; possibly never again. Whatever had happened in the car had been a good thing and Sokka had probably gone and ruined it. He did that a lot, shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise by now. He was a twenty-two year old screw up that couldn\u2019t even finish high school properly let alone hold a steady job without his sister there to help him.</p>\n<p>Fuck it. Fuck it all.</p>\n<p>He finished the last of the shop cleaning, flipping one last chair over on the counter, before trailing into the back office to do other responsible grown up things like scribble down some quick notes for whoever had the opening shift tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Sokka had just finished scrawling across a receipt on the office bench when he heard the tinkle of the bell from the front. Blinking in surprise, he craned his neck to try and peer out the door even though it wasn\u2019t strictly possible from that angle. He\u2019d flipped the sign from open to closed but hadn\u2019t bothered to turn the lock over.</p>\n<p>His mouth went dry and his fingers tightened around the pen in his hand. If this was mother fucking robbery, he was so not in the goddamn mood, swear to god he would put this pen through the goddamn fucker\u2019s eye and \u2013</p>\n<p>Zuko paused at the door and blinked at the violent death grip Sokka had on his pen and the way he was weighing it in his hand as debating turning it into a dart.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2026\u201d Zuko paused and looked adorably unsure because Sokka was standing stock still in the exact same spot he was when Zuko entered. \u201cIs now a bad time? I, uh, know you\u2019re closed but I thought I might be able to \u2026 talk to you? I should probably go, shouldn\u2019t I? Fuck, I knew this was a bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka had never heard quite so many words tumble out of his mouth before and he realized with a shock that Zuko was\u00a0<em>rambling</em>\u00a0and dear god - the word\u00a0<em>fuck\u00a0</em>sounded like heaven with the way it slipped between his teeth. Sokka knew he was staring but he couldn\u2019t help it - the red blooming across the base of Zuko\u2019s throat couldn't possibly be his imagination.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 its fine,\u201d he managed to choke out in a brilliant impersonation of a functioning human being. Hastily, he dropped the pen back to the counter. \u201cI was just finishing some things. You\u2019re always welcome here. I mean, you\u2019re not, like, intruding or anything, so, um, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>If one or both of them didn't stop stuttering like a grade-schooler on their first sugar trip, they were probably never going to get anywhere.</p>\n<p>Sokka took a deep breath, let it out, and worked for a fa\u00e7ade of casualness as he placed his palms on the counter he was leaning on and hoisted himself up so he could sit with his hands splayed behind him, feet dragging lightly along the ground as he faced Zuko. \u201cYou can come in, you know,\u201d he said because Zuko was still hovering in the doorway between the caf\u00e9 and the office space like he half expected Sokka to call the cops on him.</p>\n<p>He visibly hesitated for a moment and Sokka wondered if that was the wrong thing to say, but then Zuko stepped forward, fingers pulling lightly on the edge of the door so it swung shut behind him and Sokka struggled to breathe.</p>\n<p>Zuko approached with slow, even steps, like Sokka was a skittish stray that might bolt. He wasn\u2019t quite sure whether he should be offended by that notion or not, but when Zuko stood close enough that Sokka could smell the pleasant musk of his aftershave it was hard to mind so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to apologize,\u201d Zuko said before Sokka could even open his mouth; face a determined scraping of angles and lines and Sokka blinked at him, still a bit high off the close-enough-to-touch scent of his aftershave.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologize?\u201d he echoed vaguely and Zuko nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe other day\u2026\u201d Sokka really needed to find something to say that wasn\u2019t just parroting Zuko, but his thoughts were stuck in third gear. What happened the other day? The image of lips on lips and hands sliding low beneath his shirt roared to life in the back of his mind and Sokka\u2019s heart rate ratcheted up a notch. Hope tasted deceptively sweet.</p>\n<p>And then the rest of his brain caught up with the other words Zuko had been saying and his heart <em>froze.</em> \u201cYou wanted to apologize?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s eyes were grim and guilty and he\u2019d not made a single move to close the foot of space between them. There was stiffness in his back and an air of formality around him that reminded Sokka of the first time he came into the shop back before they\u2019d had a real conversation or he\u2019d made him laugh.</p>\n<p>Sokka felt like he was going to be sick, and then Zuko was talking again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. I wasn\u2019t thinking straight, but that\u2019s no excuse. I understand completely if you don\u2019t want anything more to do with me. I won\u2019t come here again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka stared blankly as the meaning caught up with the word.\u00a0<em>Shouldn\u2019t have done that \u2026 won\u2019t come here again</em>.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Sokka felt dizzy and he was lucky he was already propped up on the counter or else he might have had to find somewhere to sit down until the unsteady thumping of his heart evened out.</p>\n<p>Hope was sweet \u2013 and disappointment was <em>sickening. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he mumbled as he sat up straighter, lifting his sweaty palms from the desk and knotting them together in his lap so Zuko couldn\u2019t see the slick glide and the way they trembled. He tried out a laugh and it nearly winded him. \u201cYeah, no. I get it. No problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he did. He got it alright. Not like Sokka hadn\u2019t heard that before. Not like hadn\u2019t thought it himself. He was a twenty-something deadbeat who hadn\u2019t bought a new pair of jeans in a year and Zuko looked like he was on the receiving end of an inheritance that was simply mind boggling.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d let himself hope. Didn\u2019t he tell Aang that only the other day? People like him didn\u2019t end up with people like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka\u2026\u201d Zuko\u2019s expression looked pained and Sokka desperately wanted to be pleased by that, but he couldn\u2019t quite do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m a big boy, I can handle a rejection.\u201d Sokka waved a hand in his general direction and hoped that it wasn\u2019t shaking enough to be visible. \u201cIt was kiss dude, not marriage. You don\u2019t have to act like I\u2019m your responsibility. I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something interesting happened with Zuko\u2019s face that Sokka wasn\u2019t really sure he could put a name to and he blinked, opening his mouth to say something else only to realize that Zuko was right in front of him, hands on the bench either side of him and his face a bare inch away from his own. His eyes were bright and Sokka had the distant impression that he looked furious.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think this is a rejection?\u201d he hissed and Sokka stared blankly. He could feel the way Zuko\u2019s knuckles tightened on the edge of the counter, white knuckled with tension. \u201cYou think\u2026 you think I\u2019m\u00a0<em>rejecting\u00a0</em>you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Sokka leaned back a bit, but Zuko followed him. \u201cI \u2026 weren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, baffled.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d The word was almost violent. \u201cI was\u2026 Sokka, I took advantage of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He couldn\u2019t follow this conversation with a map, a GPS and his own personal tour guide. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. I would have remembered something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>(and enjoyed it too.)</p>\n<p>Zuko took in a deep breath and his eyes fluttered closed. Sokka watched with fascination, fighting the impulse to raise a finger to trace the scar that peaked out from beneath the spray of dark hair but Zuko\u2019s eyes were open again before he could even try.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did\u2026 you\u2019ve been nothing but polite and accommodating to me, even after I was so rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing polite and accommodating is kind of my job,\u201d Sokka reminded him even if it wasn\u2019t strictly true.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s face spasmed like it wanted to crumple but couldn\u2019t quite remember what muscles pulled which way for that expression to work. Sokka blinked in alarm, because apparently that had been the wrong thing to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zuko said, and his voice was almost tired, certainly lacking in the fire that had been running through it earlier. He pulled back a bit, not quite stepping away from the counter but retreating from the way he\u2019d been all up in Sokka\u2019s personal space. Sokka didn\u2019t like it as much as he should have and resisted the urge to grab him Zuko the collar and haul him back down. Clearly they were having communication issues here and trying to stick his tongue down Zuko\u2019s throat probably wouldn\u2019t solve them.</p>\n<p>Zuko ran a hand through his hair, and Sokka wanted to snort with the way it shot up in every direction, but figured now probably wasn\u2019t the time. \u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka said slowly, and Zuko\u2019s golden gaze flicked to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on here?\u201d</p>\n<p>All the energy seemed to deflate out of him at once and he stared determinedly and a stain on the ceiling that Sokka knew for a fact wasn\u2019t even that interesting. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing but your job, I knew that, but still I chose to interpret in a way that suited me.\u201d Zuko\u2019s words sounded like he\u2019d rehearsed them in front of the mirror. \u201cI all but attacked you in the car; I would understand completely if you don\u2019t want anything more to do with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka stared and tried to figure out whether he was dreaming or not, but his dreams had all been about sweaty grinding and naked bodies and tracing the edges of that scar with his tongue.</p>\n<p>The reality was far better.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko, you crazy moron,\u201d he said as calmly as he could manage and Zuko looked part offended part surprised. \u201cI kissed\u00a0<em>back</em>\u00a0\u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure I even moaned a time or two. That is not the actions of someone who never wants to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I was an idiot,\u201d Sokka talked over him, not giving him a chance to contribute because if he let Zuko say anything thing the adorable fool would probably ruin it. \u201cI \u2026 I panicked when that old bat knocked on the window and ran when I should have stayed to talk to you. If I\u2019d known you\u2019d think you were taking advantage of me or something equally as stupid, I never would have done it, I thought \u2013\u201d Sokka choked a little on his words. They didn\u2019t want to come up, he didn\u2019t want to admit to being so stupid, but if there was ever a time for secrets, it wasn\u2019t now. He needed to say this. He needed to get things sorted out. \u201cI thought\u00a0<em>you\u00a0</em>regretted it,\u201d he admitted quietly and Zuko stared, stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would\u00a0<em>I\u00a0</em>regret it?\u201d he asked and Sokka refrained from self-deprecating chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you\u00a0<em>not</em>?\u201d he asked in return, gesturing between the two of them. \u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u00a0<em>me\u00a0</em>and you\u2019re you. I mean, I don\u2019t mean to sound like a dick or anything, but you look like a super model with a bank account big enough to buy half a country and I\u2019m \u2013 well, you get what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko was back in his space again, but this time his fingers were on Sokka\u2019s cheeks tilting his face so that he could stare right into his eyes and\u00a0<em>wow\u00a0</em>who had eyes that fucking gold? Sokka suddenly had a new appreciation for Katara\u2019s Twilight books and the monologues Bella Swan could wax about the Edward Cullen\u2019s fucking eyes</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka, I have no clue what you\u2019re saying, but I\u2019d like you to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sokka agreed easily as his hands found Zuko\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>Zuko took a deep breath and rested his forehead against Sokka\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve been enamored by you since the first day,\u201d he admitted and Sokka\u2019s heat absolutely did not skip at that. \u201cAnd when you talked to me for that first time, I actually started to hope that \u2026 that it might have been mutual. But then when I kissed you and you ran, I started to doubt myself. I thought you were just being kind to me because that\u2019s your\u00a0<em>job</em>. \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Sokka said quickly. \u201cI mean, well it is but\u2026\u201d His cheeks were bright red, he knew it. He closed his eyes and muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t make that ridiculous tea for just anyone, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko chuckled and Sokka could feel the way it vibrated against his skin, sending a jolt of sudden\u00a0<em>want\u00a0</em>down his spine, and Sokka should probably stop talking at this point but he was kind of really bad at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I mean, in case you weren\u2019t listening earlier when you were freaking out, but I like you a lot, okay? I mean, I seriously thought you came here to reject me, and then you didn\u2019t even get the notice when \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Zuko said, and bent down and kissed him.</p>\n<p>His mouth was soft and the kiss was heartbreakingly tender, and Sokka didn\u2019t think he could have breathed even if he wanted to. His fingers slipped along Zuko\u2019s hips hooking into the belt hoops of his pants to drag him closer so he was pressed right up against him, fitting easily between his legs.</p>\n<p>They broke apart with a silent gasp and Sokka leaned back. \u201cJesus,\u201d he swore and Zuko pressed his smile into the crook of Sokka\u2019s neck, hands sliding down Sokka\u2019s sides to slip underneath his thin shirt and stroke along warm skin.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s breath hitched \u2013 there was no way Zuko couldn\u2019t feel that with the way his mouth was pressing little kisses along his throat \u2013 and he tightened his knees to draw him in closer, tilting his neck to the side.</p>\n<p>Zuko got the hint, grazing his teeth along Sokka\u2019s skin and Sokka couldn\u2019t contain the moan that slipped through his lips as a result. Zuko\u2019s hand on his waist tightened, the other one edging its way up his ribs. Sokka pressed them closer, wrapping his legs lightly around Zuko\u2019s waist to tug him close enough to feel the press in the front of his jeans. Sokka didn\u2019t even think about it as he rocked forward.</p>\n<p>A gasp slipped out against his throat, and Sokka grinned and did it again, biting the inside of his cheek to stop himself from making a noise at the solid heat pressing back against his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me, I swear,\u201d Zuko muttered and the hands that had been sliding along his skin fell back to his waist and Zuko yanked him forward with such sudden ferocity that Sokka yelped only to have Zuko lift his head and kiss him again.</p>\n<p>If the first kiss had been about emotion and acceptance and confirmation, this one was about heat and body and sex. Sokka opened his mouth and Zuko pressed back, licking his way inside as Sokka let slip small noises that intermingled with harsh pants. Zuko\u2019s hands were on his back, warm and heavy and firm as they slid low enough cup his ass through his way-way-<em>way\u00a0</em>too tight jeans. He broke the kiss long enough to suck in a messy breath, but then Zuko\u2019s lips were on his again, and he knew there would be bruises later.</p>\n<p>Sokka dug his heels into small of Zuko\u2019s back, urging his hips against his own and they both groaned into the kiss, panting against each other\u2019s mouths and Sokka was aware that this whole thing was sliding rapidly out of control, he was at\u00a0<em>work\u00a0</em>for, and the door wasn\u2019t even locked,\u00a0<em>anybody\u00a0</em>\u00a0could walk in \u2013</p>\n<p>Sokka had no idea how he found the strength as he ripped himself away, pushing Zuko to arms-length.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, time out,\u201d he blurted and he sounded more winded than he\u2019d care to admit. \u201cOh my\u00a0<em>god</em>. As much as I would love to have hot, sweaty office sex with you \u2013\u201d Sokka was going to have to ignore the animal glint in Zuko\u2019s eyes at that or they were never going to get out of here \u201c\u2013 The door is unlocked and Katara would kill me if she knew that I jumped you against this desk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko leaned forward and pressed his forehead back against Sokka\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIs that a promise?\u201d he asked and Sokka could feel the smirk twisting against his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko, I swear to god, I will ride you so hard you'll think I\u2019m a goddamn cowboy,\u201d Sokka swore as he threaded fingers through thick strands of hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Zuko snorted and yeah, Sokka couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p>\n<p>They stood still for a moment, Zuko\u2019s arms aroung his waist, resting just lightly under his shirt so that the pads of his thumbs could rub soft and tender along his hip bones and Sokka\u2019s fingers gliding gracefully through Zuko\u2019s hair as they caught their breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should probably finish closing shop,\u201d Sokka admitted after several long lazy minutes.</p>\n<p>Zuko shifted slightly in his grip and sighed in protest as his fingers tightened against Sokka\u2019s skin. \u201cOr we could stay here and talk?\u201d he offered.</p>\n<p>It was Sokka\u2019s turn to give a fond snort. \u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko angled his face so Sokka could see his eyes and grinned as he asked, \u201cSo; Star Wars VII \u2013 possible cinematic legend or Lucas\u2019 next train wreck waiting to happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
