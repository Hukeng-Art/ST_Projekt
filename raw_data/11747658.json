  "text": "<p>The complete shitstorm began one drab Wednesday afternoon. An algebra exam on exponential expressions was coming up, and while the material came easily enough for Katsuki, the same could not be said for a certain shitty redhead. A certain <em>persistent</em> shitty redhead, who had the absolute worst pouty-face and the tendency to use flattery to get what he wanted, whether the guy realized it or not. And that\u2019s how Katsuki had inexplicably found himself roped into yet another tutoring session with Kirishima Eijirou.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, nope, stop,\u201d Katsuki pointed at the worksheet, jabbing the equation impatiently a couple of times with his finger. \u201cSee, that exponent\u2019s negative.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRi-ight...\u201d Kirishima paused. He tapped the end of his pencil to his mouth, and it didn\u2019t help when he did shit like that because it was really fucking distracting. \u201cUhh, what does that do again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to flip the fraction in the parenthesis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, yes, I knew that. Just making sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>The past hour or so had been like this. To be fair, the whole situation could have been a lot more unbearable. Tutoring Kirishima wasn\u2019t the worst thing Katsuki could do with his time, and it wasn\u2019t like Kirishima was an idiot. The guy had the basics premise down, and he seemed to genuinely enjoy figuring things out. It was <em>math</em> that was the problem, and when all the steps were combined together, Kirishima would get overwhelmed. Then he\u2019d start second guessing himself, looking lost and confused because he\u2019d have no idea where to start.</p>\n<p>It was whenever <em>that</em> started happening that Katsuki found himself wanting to bang his head against a wall.</p>\n<p>The redhead\u2019s pencil scratched against the paper, his eyebrows furrowed deep in thought, sharp teeth gnawing at his bottom lip, and for a fleeting moment, Katsuki wondered how he wasn\u2019t breaking skin. There he worked, writing furiously, the occasional eraser shavings flying this way and that.</p>\n<p>After about a minute, Kirishima set his pencil down and lifted his head, his mouth breaking into a sheepish grin, almost apologetic. \u201cI think I did alright on this one?\u201d The way his voice went up at the end told of his uncertainty. He slid the worksheet over to Katsuki. \u201cThere are just so many little rules to remember and I always end up confusing myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re bad at math, then you just gotta work your ass off even more to get it down.\u201d He snatched the paper, eyes skimming over the chicken-scratch. \u201cThis is right, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh thank God,\u201d Kirishima heaved a sigh and leaned back in his chair, hands behind his head. \u201cIt\u2019s like what Crimson Riot said. Perseverance leads to victory!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt fucking better,\u201d Katsuki mumbled under his breath, because at this point, he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have started coming to you way earlier, you\u2019re super smart about this type of stuff!\u201d Kirishima turned to him, beaming, and there was a pattering in Katsuki\u2019s chest, that annoying one that he always happened to notice every time Kirishima smiled. \u201cBut seriously, bro, you\u2019re a lifesaver. I\u2019ve been really stressing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fucking say.\u201d The sarcasm was nearly palpable.</p>\n<p>\u2018Stressing\u2019 was the goddamn understatement of the century. Kirishima had practically <em>dogeza</em>-ed right there in the dorm common space, begging for his help. And even now, Katsuki wasn\u2019t sure what had compelled him to say yes. Wasn\u2019t sure what always compelled him to say yes, every single fucking time Kirishima asked for tutoring. Maybe it was just how goddamn persistent the guy was, and at this point, Katsuki had resigned himself to this fate.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink I can get the next one right by myself?\u201d</p>\n<p>And there it was again. He was so damn persistent, and determined, about <em>everything</em>, even when trying meant he would probably fail. And maybe Katsuki was starting to admire that about him.</p>\n<p>So he shrugged. \u201cYou can certainly try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSweet~!\u201d</p>\n<p>Immediately, Kirishima set off to work, his pencil scribbling frantically across the worksheet, writing in numbers, and scratching out mistakes. Occasionally, when he had to think about what to do next, Kirishima would tilt his head to the side, bring the pencil to tap against his temple, the tip of his tongue sticking out like he was so deep in thought that he had forgotten about it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Katsuki waited, as patiently as he could.</p>\n<p>Finally, Kirishima held up the paper with a triumphant \u201cDone!\u201d He slammed the worksheet down in front of Katsuki, his grin spreading from ear to ear, teeth practically sparkling. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki glanced over the equation. It was actually one of the more difficult ones, with a lot of steps and rules to consider, and for a split second, he was impressed that Kirishima would choose this one to work on alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking, give me a second,\u201d Katsuki murmured. He worked out the problem to the side in pen, <em>just in case</em>, and to his complete and utter satisfaction\u2026 it was actually correct. As if the past hour and a half <em>hadn\u2019t</em> been a complete waste of time.</p>\n<p>And in that moment, pride overtook him. Kirishima had listened to him. He had learned, done it all on his own, and it didn\u2019t even matter how long it had taken for them to get to this point because the result was just so goddamn satisfying.</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked up to Kirishima, who was carefully watching him, practically bouncing in his seat like a little kid.</p>\n<p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cFucking took you long enough, ya moron.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima let out a loud cheer, hands in the air, pencil flying, a look on his face of pure triumph. He turned to Katsuki with a smile on his lips, eyes twinkling. And if Katsuki had to pick the turning point, the fulcrum, the exact moment where everything started going to shit, this would be it.</p>\n<p>Katsuki knew what was about to happen. He could see it unfold before his very eyes, practically in slow-motion, like some sort of intuition, and his dumb ass still didn\u2019t bother to think of getting out of the way until it was too late. Kirishima had leaned forward and wrapped him up in a big hug.</p>\n<p>Now, Katsuki fucking hated it when Kirishima pulled shit like this. He hated physical contact in general, from <em>anyone</em>, but with Kirishima it was about ten times worse because something about it made Katsuki feel like he had been missing out on that sort of thing his entire life. Like he had been ignoring starvation for so long that his body was soaking it in, absolutely relishing it, his heart ramming too quickly in his chest, cheeks heating up, palms sweating, and he didn\u2019t understand <em>why</em>. Maybe that\u2019s what he hated the most about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, you fucker\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! Yes, I did it! I actually got it, thank you, Bakugou!\u201d Kirishima practically squealed, his celebratory shouts drowning out all protests from the blond, his arms winding tighter around him, and Katsuki felt like his lungs were going to collapse in on themselves, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna fail this test now! I\u2019ll do you proud, just you see!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, right, good, whatever,\u201d he wheezed, grabbing onto Kirishima\u2019s forearm with smoking hands, \u201cNow <em>get the fuck off of me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, sorry, sorry,\u201d Kirishima pulled away before Katsuki could bring out the pyrotechnics. He plopped back in his chair, spinning it around in celebration, \u201cBut, <em>god</em> that felt good! Ya know?\u201d</p>\n<p>In a way, Katsuki did know, because in that moment, he felt something too, something other than pride. He had felt it a few times already, here and there, on and off, but it was still jarring no matter how many times it had happened before. It was like he was suddenly hyper aware of his own heartbeat, and his breathing, and the way his stomach was tightening, twisting into knots, fluttering. Usually, he ignored the feeling, pushed it to the back of his mind, because it didn\u2019t matter. And it normally wasn\u2019t too difficult a thing to do.</p>\n<p>Except that Kirishima was just <em>so fucking happy</em>. And for some goddamn reason, that made Katsuki really fucking happy as well.</p>\n<p>His insides started churning, his heart like it wanted to shrivel up on itself.</p>\n<p>He wanted Kirishima to be happy like this. All the time.</p>\n<p>The feelings, they were too much, everything was <em>too much</em>, they made his head foggy, skin clammy, his chest squeezing so tightly by his pounding heart, his ribcage like it was being stuffed with cotton, and Katsuki thought he was going to suffocate. He grasped at his chest, taking in a slow, steady breath. A breath that stung his airways all the way down to his lungs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey\u2026?\u201d Kirishima piped up, but it was like his voice wasn\u2019t in focus. It sounded all fuzzy around the edges. \u201cYou look kinda pale, are you okay? Bro?\u201d</p>\n<p>And then, all at once, those feelings in his chest became stronger, amplified in a way he had never felt before. There was a stinging in his heart and in his lungs and everywhere else, his insides like they were physically contorting. A cough started, deep in his throat, his diaphragm lurching so much with each contraction that he felt like he was actually going to be sick.</p>\n<p>He bolted to Kirishima\u2019s bathroom, nearly tripping over his own two feet, barely managing to close the door behind him before hunching over the toilet. And it was like he needed to cough, or needed to be sick, all at the same time. His eyes were shut so tight that he could see waves of white, and he was hacking his lungs out so much that his throat felt like it was raw, as bile and god knows what else was forced out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>And then, the coughing subsided. He wiped away the tears that had stung the corners of his eyes, sat back on his heels, taking the few seconds he needed to gasp air back into his lungs. Exhaling a shaky breath, he ran his hands down his face before glancing into the toilet basin.</p>\n<p>He froze in wide-eyed horror.</p>\n<p>There were petals. Like actual, literal flower petals, just floating in the water.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a soft knock on the door. \u201cHey, dude, are you ok? Do you need water or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>The door handle twisted, and before Katsuki could even think, he flushed toilet. Because whatever the fuck <em>that</em> was, was not something that Kirishima needed to see. Or anyone else, for that matter.</p>\n<p>As the door opened, Katsuki stood up, wiping his mouth, his voice coming out hoarse. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201d His legs were shaking. And when his eyes landed on Kirishima, he almost felt like he was going to be sick all over again. But he forced it down.</p>\n<p>Kirishima gave him a once-over, his brow creased in concern, as if he couldn\u2019t decide how to be the most helpful. \u201cDo you need me to take you to the Recovery Girl? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s left for the night yet\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d It came out more forceful than he had intended, but Katsuki could not think straight, his head was still spinning. Why did he feel so dizzy? Why was his chest in pain? What the fuck were those petals? \u00a0\u201cNo, I must have just, fucking, eaten something that was bad. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI swear, they\u2019re feeding us poison at this school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima laughed at that, but it was a little forced. The guy was still worried. \u201cYeah, well I trust the Lunch Hero, so maybe you\u2019ve been snacking on something in your room that\u2019s expired?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki grunted, neither in denial or agreement. He pushed past Kirishima and made his way back to the desk. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to work. Ya gotta show me your correct answer wasn\u2019t a fluke or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima trailed behind him, his concern seemingly already forgotten. \u201cYessir!\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, whatever it was, it seemed to have passed. But as he and Kirishima studied, and as his heart continued to flutter and his lungs continued to squeeze, Katsuki couldn\u2019t shake the unsettling feeling that something was really fucking wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second time it happened was during school break the next day. The teachers were switching classrooms, so everyone was eating snacks, socializing, being complete and utter fucking nuisances. Meanwhile, Katsuki had just been minding his own damn business, listening to his ear-buds so he didn\u2019t have to make eye contact with anyone. The usual.</p>\n<p>There was a burst of laughter from his right. He turned sharply to the culprits \u2013 the pink girl must have just cracked a joke, and great, now half the goddamn class was having a jolly fucking time. But above all the others' laughs stood out one, so obnoxious and so loud that he could make it out over his music. Katsuki glared at the offending redhead, whose laugh was so strong that he was practically doubling over on himself from the sheer force of it. But, it was lively, hearty, all dimples and teeth \u2013 just an all-around genuine, strong laugh, and for a split second, Katsuki found himself wondering what he could do to make Kirishima laugh like that.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t as powerful this time, just starting as a tickle in the back of his throat, the slight floral scent in his nose, so slight that he didn\u2019t even notice it at first. But it quickly escalated, and next thing Katsuki knew, his heart felt like it was pressing in on itself, tightening, restricting its own beating, a cough rumbling from his chest, <em>shit, not this again</em>.</p>\n<p>Katsuki hid his mouth into his inner elbow as he hacked into it, the beginnings of the petals already starting to escape. He wrenching himself from his seat, practically skidding across the room, not caring whose eyes trailed curiously after him. He burst into the hallway, barely missing a collision with Present Mic as he bolted to the bathroom and promptly coughed up in the nearest stall.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, there were petals. Not as many as the first time, but the sight was still really fucking disturbing, and Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but stare for what was probably far longer than necessary. They were large, a deep red, rose petals. Honestly, what the fuck was even happening? He stood to his feet, wiping at his mouth with his sleeve, leaning against the stall wall until his head stopped swimming.</p>\n<p>It was probably just the side effect of some shitty quirk. Like that girl from Class 1-B or something. Katsuki wasn\u2019t certain of the details, but he was pretty sure her quirk had something to do with plants. He couldn\u2019t remember. Couldn\u2019t be bothered to remember. If it was a quirk, it would probably just wear off on its own anyways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next time it happened was right before that afternoon\u2019s training.</p>\n<p>They were supposed to be doing 3v3 battles in some alleyway setting, but Katsuki didn\u2019t even make it that far.</p>\n<p>Most everyone had put on their costumes and were congregated in the gym area, stretching, warming up for the upcoming fights. Katsuki had just wrapped up his standing routine and had taken a seat on the floor, legs stretched in front of him at a ninety-degree-angle. He bent at the waist, arms stretched in front of him, meeting his left knee with his nose, exhale.</p>\n<p>Just then, the door to the boy\u2019s locker room opened, and out came the tape guy and Kirishima. Kirishima, with his fucking stupid shoulder gear things, and his face mask that honestly\u00a0looked a bit painful, and his weird skirt cape that had literally no purpose whatsoever. The guy was fucking ridiculous. And Kirishima\u2019s eyes scanned the gym mats in front of him, surveying his stretching classmates, his eyes making contact with Katsuki\u2019s. The redhead smiled, <em>beamed</em>, gave a little wave. He left Tape Guy\u2019s side, walking as if to sit next to him.</p>\n<p>This time, Katsuki could sense it coming a mile away. He could feel his heart rate pick up, could feel his lungs aching already, as if they knew that they would soon be in need of air. He could feel the tingling, stinging, tickling feeling in his throat that always triggered a cough. But just because he knew it was coming didn\u2019t make it any better.</p>\n<p>The last thing Katsuki wanted to do was bring attention to himself when he was in this state. As he stood and more or less rushed his way back to the locker rooms, he tried his best to be discrete. Tried his best to ignore how Kirishima\u2019s voice called after him, filled with concern. But once the door closed behind him, Katsuki sprinted to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>And as he kneeled, coughing over the toilet once again, hand on his abdomen, breath coming in uneven, shaky gasps, head spinning so much that he felt like he could faint, the thought occurred that he should probably see the nurse. Katsuki couldn\u2019t afford to waste time on shit like this. He was supposed to be learning how to kick villain\u2019s asses, not dealing with this absolute fuckery. But, on the other hand, if word got out that he was coughing up rose petals, and that it was getting in the way of his training, who knows how the UA faculty would treat him? If it was starting to affect his respiratory system, they might force him to lighten up on physical activity until the effects wore off. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to fall behind like that.</p>\n<p>Katsuki flushed the toilet. Then, he listened carefully to his surroundings \u2013 not a sound. He let out a shaky sigh of relief. Seems he was alone after all. It was better that way, with no one there to look down on him at him all worried, no one to tell Eraserhead that he had just been coughing up in a bathroom stall. He just needed to get back out there, start the training exercise, and hope that this would all just go away.</p>\n<p>If it really was just someone\u2019s stupid quirk, the effect would have to wear off eventually. He could work it out by himself, no need to get anyone involved. But \u2013 and his stomach sank at the thought \u2013 the last thing he wanted was for the coughing to get <em>worse</em>.</p>\n<p>In that moment, as Katsuki exited the stall, he made a decision: if whatever this bullshit was, was still happening by the time the weekend rolled around, then maybe it would be in his best interest to get it checked out.</p>\n<p>What this all boiled down to was a waiting game. If waiting was all it could take to fix the problem, then it was something that Katsuki was willing to put up with. He just hoped it would all stop sooner than later. He was fucking sick of the taste of flowers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That same afternoon during the training exercise, it happened again. And again, when he was returning to the dorm common space after dinner. Another time that Friday morning when he woke up. Then scattered throughout the day, during a break, at lunchtime, even once during a class, making Aizawa ask him if he needed to go to Recovery Girl. But he hadn\u2019t waited long enough yet, so with ears burning in embarrassment, Katsuki had refused.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, later that evening, Katsuki was mentally kicking himself for not agreeing to see the nurse when he had the chance, because now she was off campus for the weekend while he was coughing up petals into a toilet for the ninth time that day.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, it hadn\u2019t stopped. If anything, it was getting <em>worse</em>, just based on sheer number of incidences alone.</p>\n<p>And then it was Saturday morning, birds chirping, the young sunlight gently flitting through the window, and Katsuki was kneeling over his toilet, hacking from his lungs, petals falling from his lips. And it hurt. His throat was raw, his diaphragm ached, his eyes stung, and there was this nagging in his brain, making him come to a conclusion that he had been avoiding for most of the week.</p>\n<p>Quirk effects usually don\u2019t last this long. This was something new. He couldn\u2019t keep ignoring it.</p>\n<p>Finally, when it felt like the coughing fit was subsiding, he grabbed his phone. His thumb hovered over the screen for just a moment, hesitating. But Katsuki wasn\u2019t an idiot. Sure, he didn\u2019t like help when he didn\u2019t need it, but he was smart enough to know when he did need help, and he definitely needed help now. So he gave in, unlocked the phone. Called the one person he could think of to call.</p>\n<p>He counted the rings, until finally there was a click followed by a sleepy voice on the other end. \u201c<em>Mmh? What\u2019s up, kiddo?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother sighed. \u201c<em>Katsuki, it\u2019s six in the morning\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, I\u2014\u201d Katsuki had just barely managed getting his phone out of the way in time for him to kneel over the toilet, another wave of petals forcing their way from his lungs and out his mouth. He hacked and coughed, cheeks burning, the insides of his ribcage like they were contorting, until it finally relented. \u201c<em>Fuck</em>. I think I\u2019m really sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>There were whispers on the other end \u2013 Katsuki could make out deeper voice, \u2018<em>maybe the flu?\u2019</em>, and fucking great, now his dad was getting involved. When his mom\u2019s voice came back on the line, she sounded a lot more alert. \u201c<em>Are you throwing up? Do you have a fever?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the goddamn flu, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He peered down at the bowl, with water and floating petals, roses, deep red. How could he explain something like that? And over the phone? His lungs still burned, his breaths raspy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s complete bullshit is what it is,\u201d he finally managed to gasp out, bringing a hand to wipe at his singing eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Do you need me to take you to a doctor?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A doctor\u2019s visit was the last thing Katsuki wanted. But his egotistical need to work through his problems by himself was kinda being shat on by his profound need to know what the fuck was going on. What else was he supposed to do?</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d is all he mumbled.</p>\n<p>Of all people, his mom would know what degree of severity it takes to get Katsuki to accept help. Her voice turned grave. \u201c<em>I\u2019m getting out of bed now. Be ready in 20 minutes. I\u2019ll deal with the school.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMa\u2019am, your son has developed a condition called Hanahaki Disorder.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was bullshit. All of it.</p>\n<p>Trees and cars and buildings flew by, and his eyes trailed after them all. Even still, he could feel his rage boiling inside of him. They pulled up to a stop light, and he heard his mother sigh, which always happened right before she opened her goddamn mouth, and frankly Katsuki didn\u2019t want to hear a single word of what she had to say.</p>\n<p>For a few seconds, her finger just tapped the steering wheel in time with the turn signal. She took one more breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou caused quite a scene back there, kiddo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki clenched his jaw and kept quiet, waiting for them to start driving again. At least when they were moving, the whizzing scenery was a distraction.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously. Firing off your quirk, threatening the doctor, in a ward full of extremely vulnerable people? Not a smart move, you\u2019re lucky they didn\u2019t sedate you or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>When they picked up speed, he tried to read each road sign as they passed, count to ten forwards and backwards, anything to occupy his mind. Usually, he didn\u2019t bother with those fucking stupid anger management techniques, but his previous outburst had made him face his mother\u2019s wrath once that day, and he was too fucking exhausted to deal with it a second time.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d his mom tried again when he didn\u2019t answer, because that\u2019s exactly the type of insufferable woman that she is. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s weird, and maybe even scary, and uncomfortable\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUncomfortable? What gave you that idea?\u201d He snapped. His heart rammed in his chest, his anger seethed. \u201cIs it the fact that I cough up fucking flowers, all the fucking time, like it\u2019s a fucking thing to do? Is that what gave it away?\u201d He turned back to the window, shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit, so stop acting like you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch the sass, punk, I\u2019m being empathetic here.\u201d</p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t even warrant a reply, so he just <em>tch</em>ed.</p>\n<p>His mother sighed again, as if she wanted to say something else. As if every silence was some fucking invitation for her to share her shit opinion. Her grip on the steering wheel tightened. Then, her voice turned quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki didn\u2019t know how to respond at first. He just blinked. Then, he turned sharply toward her, eyes raging with fire. \u201c<em>Excuse</em> me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard what the doctor said, Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, unfortunately. As if he would believe any of that horse shit. He couldn\u2019t stop the growl that built in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a professional.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat don\u2019t mean jack shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom laughed at that. \u201cListen, ya brat, I\u2019d take his medical advice over yours any day. Just because you don\u2019t like his answer\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe literally doesn\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh really? Cause it sounds to me like you\u2019re the one who\u2019s clueless, and if you\u2019d just pay attention to your own feelings for once, then you\u2019d really be doing yourself a huge favor here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know me, and neither do you, so fucking drop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly hell, kid,\u201d she huffed, shaking her head in disbelief, her eyes set on the road ahead. \u201cSometimes talking with you feels like banging a head against a wall, ya know? For one, I know you\u2019re stubborn \u2013 <em>god</em> do I know it. And if you\u2019re perfectly happy with sealing yourself off from the rest of the world, not confronting the root of the problem, and living the rest of your life barfing up flowers every time you so much as get butterflies in your stomach, then by all means, be my fucking guest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I am your <em>mother</em>, Katsuki.\u201d With that, she turned to look at him, for just a moment, her eyes intense. She turned away. \u201cI\u2019d say between the three of us, I\u2019ve got you figured out the most. And believe it or not, as <em>your mother</em>, I want you to get better. And so does Dr. Yamakawa, it\u2019s his fucking job. Why can\u2019t you seem to get that?\u201d She raised an eyebrow, her lip upturning slightly. \u201cToo stubborn?\u201d</p>\n<p>This was not a battle worth fighting, so \u201cwhatever\u201d was all Katsuki grumbled before glaring back out the window.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere became still, the only sound the rumble of the car motor and the occasional shifting of gears.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, maybe when you figure out who it is, you can hang out with them more? Give yourself some opportunities?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rage, pure rage was boiling in him. \u201cNo, we are <em>not</em> having that fucking conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes we are,\u201d his mom responded snappily. \u201cYou gotta face your emotions at some point, kiddo. Don\u2019t be arrogant, the doctor even told you the only thing that can cause the disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t forget the doctor\u2019s words even if he tried. They echoed around in his head, lingering there.</p>\n<p>He screwed his eyes shut, bringing his hands to cover his ears. \u201cShut up! Shut up, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0\u2018A person who is susceptible to developing Hanahaki Disorder is someone who experiences a deep love\u2014\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019m not, fucking, <em>in love,</em> or whatever\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>His stomach lurched.</p>\n<p>\n<em>In love.</em>\n</p>\n<p>An image flashed through his mind \u2013 a cheery face, a glistening smile, bright eyes. Shitty hair.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No.</em>\n</p>\n<p>His insides were fluttering, chest hurting, his lungs aching from pressure, and he was coughing again, hacking deep in his rib cage, enough to sting the back of his throat and make his diaphragm throb from the exertion. And there was a floral scent in his nose, a disgusting taste in his mouth, and two damp petals fell into his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>His fist slammed against the dashboard. \u201cI said <em>shut up</em>!\u201d he gasped between breaths. He buried his face in his hands, hoping to hide any of the stinging tears that might be hanging from the edge of his waterlines. \u201cJust shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The car parked \u2013 were they finally home? \u2013 and there was a hand on his back, rubbing gentle circles as he wheezed out a few labored breaths.</p>\n<p>There they sat for the several moments that Katsuki needed to recover. His mother just patted his back, whispering soft words that he couldn\u2019t even make out under her breath, but something about the faint sound was comforting. It reminded him of when he was a kid, sick with a cold, or crying because he had hurt himself, and as much as he hated to admit it even in his own mind, it really did help. It lulled him into a calm trance, just like it always had.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, his mother took her hand away and passed him a tissue. \u201cYour medicine will be at the pharmacy sometime Monday,\u201d she finally spoke. \u201cUntil then, you\u2019re staying at home for the weekend. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nodded. He was numb.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd \u2013 hey, look up at me, okay?\u201d His mom brought her fingers under his chin, lifting his head. She saw his face, all red and blotchy, and she didn\u2019t laugh. She never laughed at him when he looked like this. \u201cIf you ever need to talk about things, like how you feel, or anything else that\u2019s bothering you, your dad and I will stay right here, at home for you. We\u2019re gonna help you get through this. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He set his jaw and said nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, kiddo, let\u2019s get lunch made,\u201d his mom ruffled his hair before opening her car door and stepping out. \u201cYou chop the veggies, if we hurry, it\u2019ll be ready by the time Dad gets back from his photo-shoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Katsuki needed to find a good distraction from this absolute hellweek, cooking was definitely it. Whenever he had a tantrum as a child, his parents would ask for his help preparing dinner, and he usually calmed down. Ever since then, cooking had a sort of cathartic effect on him. Chopping things up, it was relaxing, and at this point, his muscles could go through the motions without much thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou almost done with the cabbage?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki hummed, bringing the knife down a few more times before handing the cutting board to his mom, who scraped the strips of veggies into the pan so they could join the chicken. She handed back the board, motioning absentmindedly to a few carrots on the counter, which he set to work on.</p>\n<p>There were heavy footsteps approaching the back door, and then his dad strolled in, the door slamming behind him. \u201cHey, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Katsuki and his mom mumbled an obligatory \u2018Welcome home\u2019.</p>\n<p>His dad let out a relieved sigh, surveying the domestic scene in front of him as he toed out of his shoes. He stepped into the kitchen and looked over Mom\u2019s shoulder, placing a hand on her hip. \u201cSmells good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, yakisoba.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki wanted to hurl, for real this time. Seriously, he was standing right there, and he had eyes and everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the diagnosis?\u201d Dad walked past Katsuki on his way to the kitchen table, ruffling his hair as he did. Katsuki\u2019s grip on his knife tightened, just a bit. \u201cYou dying already? Although if it\u2019s the flu, I advise you to <em>step away</em> from the food.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom turned, pointing her spatula at Katsuki\u2019s dad with a hand on her hip. \u201cYour son is barfing up flowers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026?\u201d His dad trailed off, blinking in surprise. \u201cWell, <em>that</em> doesn\u2019t sound like the flu at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Katsuki muttered under his breath. He handed his mom the cutting board again so she could add the carrot, and then he started on the onion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean I knew it probably wasn\u2019t the flu since you wanted to wait for me to get home to talk about it, but <em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom stirred the pan a few times, poking her spoon at the cabbage as it wilted. \u201cDoctor called it the Hanahaki disease or something. Apparently it\u2019s pretty rare. Says it\u2019s nothing too serious though, as long as it is treated. He sent me a bunch of websites about it, blogs and stuff, we can look through it all tonight when the brat\u2019s in bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m literally standing right here, you assholes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, flowers?\u201d His dad ignored Katsuki\u2019s comment, instead glancing over to him, his eyebrows set low. \u201cDo you mean that literally? Or, more\u2026 I don\u2019t know, metaphorically?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe it was because they were talking about his condition, reminding him about it, because Katsuki felt the signs that meant it was about to happen again. It was the way his heartbeat sped up, the burn in his lungs. That\u2019s how it always started, followed by a tickle at the back of his throat. He braced one hand against the counter, coughing harshly a couple times into his inner elbow. A single petal this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, no sir,\u201d his mom hissed, whacking at Katsuki with a kitchen towel. \u201cYou fucker, what did I tell you about roses near the food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, think of the germs!\u201d She pressed an entire roll of paper towels into his chest, waving her other hand as if to shoo him off. \u201cJust leave the rest to me, it\u2019s almost done anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking invalid, sheesh, woman\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTable! Sit. <em>Now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki stuck the knife in the cutting board and groaned, rolling his eyes, sulking to the trashcan where he disposed of the used towel, and then dragging his feet to the kitchen table to plop down as ungracefully as he could. As soon as Dad was done placing dishes, he joined him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. Uh. You were not kidding.\u201d His dad\u2019s face actually looked a little pale. He stared at Katsuki like he had just sprouted a new head or something, which was definitely not appreciated. \u201cYou\u2019re <em>literally</em> coughing up rose petals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I know, it sounds like complete bullshit,\u201d Mom called out over her shoulder as she stirred in the noodles to the pan. \u201cIf it was the effect of some quirk, then <em>maybe</em> it would be a little easier to swallow, but an actual medical condition? But he\u2019s been doing it all morning. You saw it yourself just now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me there\u2019s a cure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Yamakawa said, usually if it\u2019s left untreated, it can lead to a whole slew of other health problems, so we can\u2019t just hope that it will sort itself out. Thank god there\u2019s medicine available.\u201d She clicked the stovetop off and brought the pan to the table, setting it on a potholder and taking a seat. \u201cThe condition is pretty uncommon, so the pills have to be specially ordered, shipped all the way from India.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki took a small portion of noodles, but honestly he wasn\u2019t very hungry. Wasn\u2019t sure how much he could stomach. He hated talking about all of this.</p>\n<p>If his dad\u2019s expression was anything to go by, he was having a hard time grasping it, too. He was all wide-eyed and scrunched eyebrows, with a confused lopsided frown. \u201cHow long will treatment take?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout a week for the medication to stop the symptoms, and until that happens, he needs minimal physical exertion. Which, I know you\u2019re not gonna want to do,\u201d Katsuki\u2019s mom turned to him, and it was ridiculous how she was chiding him for something he hadn\u2019t even done yet. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want you suffocating on your own flower petals out there, so until the meds kick in, lighten up on the training would ya?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki let out a growl, glaring daggers into her. \u201cI can fucking handle myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>She just gave him a look, an eyebrow arched, clearly unconvinced. Katsuki broke eye contact. He was tired of looking at that patronizing bullshit.</p>\n<p>Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Mom turn back to her food. \u201cAfter the meds, it\u2019s monthly check-ups, and the rest is really just gonna depend on him. It\u2019s not like he can have a surgery and the problem\u2019s over -- it's expensive as hell, it's super invasive, and it's just all-around impractical, especially when the medication exists. It's going to take time, though. And he\u2019s <em>got</em> to learn how to get over himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, fuck off\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet over what?\u201d His dad cut in, his need for answers making him overlook the dangerous tone in Katsuki\u2019s voice. \u201cHow does something like this even happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom froze at that. She looked up to Dad, then over to Katsuki. Then back at Dad again. Like she thought they were about to tread on a field of landmines and was trying to calculate the safest path. Finally, she let out a sigh. \u201cWell, the doctor said it\u2019s because\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fucking wrong, I already told you\u2014\u201d \u00a0But before Katsuki could fight back, his words faltered. There was that burning again. And the squeezing, and the twisting.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, nope, not while we\u2019re trying to eat,\u201d His mom pointed frantically towards the stairwell. \u201cDeal with that in your room.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Katsuki didn\u2019t have the strength of will to protest, his coughing fits were embarrassing enough as they were. He grabbed the paper towels with one hand, the other coving his mouth, and he bolted to the stairs, taking them two at a time. By the time he reached the top landing, there were two petals in his hand. And it was so disgusting, so frustrating. He hated it.</p>\n<p>But Katsuki wasn\u2019t an idiot. There was no reason he couldn\u2019t have just gone into the tatami room, or the office, which meant that his mom wanted him as far away as possible so they could talk about him. No way in hell he wasn\u2019t gonna listen to what they had to say. So he barreled his way to his room, making his feet stomp as loud as possible. At the last second, he slammed his bedroom door in front of him before turning around and tiptoeing back to the top of the stairs.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t hear anything at first, so he slid his way down a couple of steps, trying to keep his weight distributed evenly so nothing would creak, just like he had done when he was a nosey kid. Finally, he could start to make out his mom\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the face he makes whenever it\u2019s about to happen. See it. Learn it. Know it well. Have tissues ready. Be prepared to steer him to the closest toilet.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad said something very low and deeply perplexed, but Katsuki couldn\u2019t quite hear what was being said. Then there was a very distinct \u201cBut seriously, how does that even happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s another unbelievable thing. Literally no one can figure out how it\u2019s possible. Not doctors, not researchers, not biologists.\u201d There was the clanking of dishes, maybe they were clearing off the table already. His mom\u2019s voice turned thoughtful, if not a bit hesitant, \u201cBut the doctor did say something, it\u2019s what made Katsuki have that outburst at the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh no, not this shit again.</p>\n<p>But no matter how much he didn\u2019t want to hear this nonsense again, his mom\u2019s voice carried quite clearly up the stairwell. \u201cHe said the only way the disorder can develop is if a person experiences a deep, unrequited love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rested his face in his palms, groaning. Willing the ache that was building in his chest to fucking <em>go away</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026 Love? You can\u2019t be serious, <em>our</em> Katsuki? And, we\u2019re just supposed to believe that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, his dad knew what the fuck was up. He knew how completely bullshit it all was.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what else can we believe?\u201d His mom\u2019s voice had turned shrill, almost desperate. \u201cFor all we know, he could be like, madly smitten over someone, and he doesn\u2019t even realize it because, well, you know how he is. He\u2019s so\u2026 so emotionally\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Constipated?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Katsuki wanted to burn the whole house down right then and there. If his parents were gonna spew shit out of their mouths like that, they might as well say it to his fucking face.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the thing is\u2026\u201d There was a pause, and his mother\u2019s voice turned even quieter, to the point where he could barely make out her words. \u201cI think it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could feel his jaw grit, his teeth grinding together.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut who\u2026 who would he even\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would have to be someone who means a lot to him, right? And you know how he is, so there can\u2019t be too many people who fit that bill. Well, I\u2019ve had a few hours to think it through, and\u2026\u201d Her voice paused. It turned even lower still. \u201cYou know the kid that Katsuki tutors sometimes? The cute little redhead?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a heartbeat. Then two. Then more, thumping, faster and faster.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember, Katsuki picked him to be on his team in the Cavalry Battle.\u201d</p>\n<p>He brought a hand to grasp at his chest, where there was a fire in his lungs, in his heart, the flames clenching and unclenching, squirming, writhing.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cAnd,</em> according to UA faculty and the police reports, he\u2019s the kid that coordinated his rescue from the villains.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then there was the tickling in the back of his throat, like he had swallowed water down the wrong pipe, but it was growing, sickening perfume filling his airways, he couldn\u2019t even breathe.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No, no, no.</em>\n</p>\n<p>His dad\u2019s voice was next. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>No. She\u2019s fucking wrong.</em>\n</p>\n<p>There was one last, pounding heartbeat, as time slowed to a crawl.</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima Eijirou.\u201d Her voice rang out, loud and clear. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely him.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then his mind was filled with red hair and sharp teeth and a glistening smile, the sound of his laughter, so beautiful that he wanted to listen to it forever, and it wouldn\u2019t go away. It consumed him, all of him, his entire body, worse than it ever had before \u2013 the butterflies in his stomach going wild, his heart trying to beat out of its cage, his lungs burning for air, and it hurt. It <em>hurt</em>, so much he doubled over, his eyes stinging so badly he could cry, and he couldn\u2019t hold back the coughing any longer. He let out a hack, his throat already scratching in pain.</p>\n<p>The voices in the kitchen immediately went quiet.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Shit.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He stood up as best as he could on wobbly legs, his coughing threatening to throw him off balance. Not caring anymore about making sound, he clambered his way up the top three steps until he was safe on the landing.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki-?\u201d A voice called after him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuck, fuck, goddammit\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>The petals piled up, one by one with every cough and hurl, into his mouth and into his hand, overflowing, falling everywhere. He bolted to his room, leaving a trail in his wake, slamming the door behind him.</p>\n<p>He tore his hand from his mouth, gasping for air, as a mass of petals plummeted to the floor, flitting every which way. He watched them with disgust, trampling them with a few angry stomps of his foot.</p>\n<p>Fuck this. Fuck all of this.</p>\n<p>He let out a yell, turning to his wall and kicking at it in frustration. Not enough to damage it, just enough to hurt, to ease out even just a fraction of his rage. Then he did it again, because there wasn\u2019t anything else he could do. Next was his fist, his quirk, knocking against the wall, each blow followed by a bellow, a snarl, over and over until it felt like his muscles were too tense to continue and his brain was too numb to even care anymore.</p>\n<p>He let out a shaky gasp, turning his back to the wall, leaning against it, sliding to the floor. He glanced at the petals that had fluttered to the ground around him with disinterest.</p>\n<p>He was not in love with Shitty Hair Kirishima.</p>\n<p>His arm reached out dazedly, his fingers picked up a petal. His eyes studied it.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t in love. He wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The roses said otherwise.</p>\n<p>Katsuki couldn\u2019t think of anything else he could do, so he stayed locked up in his room that night. His parents left him alone. Which was probably the smartest fucking thing they had done all day, Katsuki wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d have been able to stop himself from flying off the handle. At some point, one of them had left something by his door, probably dinner from that evening. Katsuki wasn\u2019t hungry.</p>\n<p>The sky outside had since gone dark, and at some point he had heard his parents head off to bed. That had probably been a few hours ago, but Katsuki didn\u2019t really know for sure. He had just been lying on his bed, staring at his wall \u2013 and, once the sun had set, staring into darkness.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t like he was actually sleeping or anything, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep even if he wanted to. Which, he wanted to. \u00a0If he was asleep, he wouldn\u2019t be stuck thinking about bullshit. But, as he was begrudgingly coming to realize, <em>not</em> thinking about something was infinitely easier said than done. The best he could do for now was keep his thoughts foggy, his mind in a haze. Not focus on anything, just to keep the petals at bay.</p>\n<p>But suddenly, his phone let out a buzz, the screen lighting up his dark room. As if by instinct, Katsuki grabbed it and squinted at the notification.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [Shitty Hair] 23:46</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hey Bakugou! Just checking in :) I heard ur mom picked u up this morning, everything ok?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, <em>shit</em>, he was gasping for air before he had even finished reading the text.</p>\n<p>It was the same shit all over again. In a frantic scramble, Katsuki swung his legs over the side of the bed, feet making landfall, and then he was bolting to his door, a bit of a stagger in his steps as the sudden shift in position made his head swim and as the beginnings of the coughs set him off balance. The way his chest was already heaving, over and over again, as petals forced their way up his wind pipe, made it difficult to focus on finer movements. After struggling with the lock, he swung open the door and stomped to the bathroom, barely managing to get his head over the toilet basin before the petals fell.</p>\n<p>There he coughed and hacked, so much that he felt like he could throw up, drool dripping from his mouth like some sort of an animal, fingers practically clawing at his chest and throat, until it finally relented and air shakily entered his lungs again.</p>\n<p>Honestly, fuck Kirishima. Fuck him, for being so\u2026 so\u2026</p>\n<p>The hallway light turned on behind him, the room brightening as the door creaked open, and there was the soft padding of footsteps approaching, a hand resting on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Katsuki turned sharply, glaring.</p>\n<p>It was his dad, robed and bleary-eyed, holding a water bottle down to him. Without a word, Katsuki grabbed the bottle and uncapped it, shrugging the hand off of his shoulder before draining half the water in just a few gulps.</p>\n<p>His dad\u2019s let out a yawn, scratching the nape of his neck. \u201cYou alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki stared him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a big no. Point taken.\u201d Dad rubbed at his eyes, his voice a grumbled mess. \u201cYou want food? There\u2019s leftovers downstairs. Curry. I made it extra spicy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Leave me alone.\u201d Katsuki flushed the toilet and lowered the lid so he could sit on it while he caught his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, in that case\u2026\u201d His dad blew air from puffed-up cheeks, looking around him like he wasn\u2019t sure why he was even there. But then, he slowly looked up to Katsuki, his brow quipped curiously. \u201cWhat set it off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe flowers. One of the blogs said there\u2019s usually a trigger or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked away, jaw set. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Fucking, mind your own business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to understand what you\u2019re going through, that\u2019s all. It's why I want to ask questions. That way, I can know how to help. But if I shouldn\u2019t even bother trying, then I won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki continued to look to the side, a pout on his lips. It wasn\u2019t that he needed someone to understand. He didn\u2019t need sympathy, or empathy, or pity, or any of that bullshit. But, there was something comforting in the idea of venting, letting all of his frustration out on open and willing ears. Maybe it would lift some of the weight that had found itself resting heavily on his chest. So he shrugged, keeping his eyebrows low so his dad would still know how decidedly <em>not happy</em> he was about it.</p>\n<p>Taking the shrug as an invitation, his dad nodded, more to himself than anything. He leaned against the doorframe, hunkering down as if they were gonna have some sort of a deep conversation. \u201cThen, if it\u2019s okay to ask, what does it feel like? When you\u2026 you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0And Katsuki should have just left it at that. An immediate, jarring deadpan, no hesitation. It <em>was</em> hell, and that was all that his dad needed to know. But the look in Dad\u2019s eyes \u2013 uneasiness, curiosity, concern, all wrapped into one\u00a0\u2013 for some reason, it urged Katsuki on. So he kept his head down, cleared his throat. Let out whatever his voice would allow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that feeling of food going down the wrong pipe. Except, imagine it fucking ten times worse. It burns, stings. Smells like shit, tastes like shit, so bad that I could actually puke. It can happen literally whenever it fucking feels like it. And once it starts, it won\u2019t stop no matter how hard I try.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room fell completely silent at that. And when Katsuki finally looked up, their eyes meeting, the way his dad\u00a0was looking at him\u2026 it was <em>pitying.</em> And it was infuriating. That\u2019s exactly why he should have just kept his goddamn mouth shut. The water bottle crinkled\u00a0harshly in his tightening grip, his jaw so tense that it was starting to hurt. With a snarl on his lips, he fixed his eyes on the floor again. His dad staring at him like that, it made him feel cornered. Claustrophobic. It needed to stop.</p>\n<p>He stood, taking one last long gulp of water before crunching the plastic totally in his hands and tossing it into the waste basket. \"I'm going to bed.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right, before you go...\u201d his dad piped up, his hand reaching for something in his robe pocket before offering the object to Katsuki. \u201cHere's this. You dropped it when you came in here. You\u2019re lucky the screen didn\u2019t crack on the tile.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. It was his phone. In his mad dash for the bathroom, it must have slipped through his fingers. Katsuki grabbed it, pressing the home button and watching it light up in his palms. The notification was still there, bright like a beacon, and he could feel his stomach lurch at the sight, petals threatening to cross his lips again. He tried his best to keep them at bay, through sheer force of will alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only we knew what the trigger was,\u201d his dad wondered out loud, quietly, some curious tone peeking through his voice. \u201cThen, maybe we could avoid something like this it in the future. You know?\u201d</p>\n<p>With scrunched brows, Katsuki looked up. His eyes locked with his dad's, who was peering at him knowingly. Katsuki\u2019s gaze lowered back to his phone. To the text notification that was glowing back at him. As realization struck him, a growl rumbled deep in his throat. He glared back at Dad, one last time.</p>\n<p>That nosey fucker.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off. I mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d his dad held up a hand in surrender. \u201cYou deserve privacy, and if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, then we won\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a grunt, Katsuki pushed past him, trudging through the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut if you <em>do</em> want to talk about it\u2026\u201d his dad\u2019s voice started calmly after him, the sincere tone making Katsuki freeze in his tracks. \u201cIf you ever need to, you can. We\u2019ll listen, both me and your mother. You\u2026\u00a0 you do know that, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cRight, Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki didn\u2019t say anything at that. Didn\u2019t turn around, didn\u2019t even hum in acknowledgement. Just flipped his middle finger over his shoulder and sulked down the corridor, slamming his bedroom door behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until well after noon that Katsuki finally reemerged from his room, stomach grumbling loudly in complaint about its neglect. He ignored his parents calling out to him from where they were working in their office, and prepared himself a late lunch. It was just leftovers from the previous day, and much more than his strict training diet would usually allow. But his regimen had already been fucked over by this whole ordeal anyways, and he was really fucking hungry, so whatever.</p>\n<p>The coughing fits had subsided, just the tiniest bit. Probably because he wasn't at school around any possible triggers. But the smallest thing could still set the petals off at any time. A newscaster on TV, with hair fiery red under the bright studio lights, the occasional text from a certain concerned classmate, these types of things left him racing for the nearest trashcan. So Katsuki turned off the TV. Turned off his phone. He tried to occupy his mind the rest of the day by taking a shower and finishing his weekend\u2019s homework. He went to bed early again, hoping to shorten the time until all of this bullshit would finally stop.</p>\n<p>And then it was Monday morning, another doctor\u2019s appointment. The doctor talked his parents through the medication, how it worked, its side-effect, as well as more briefing about the nature of the disorder itself. Katsuki was supposed to be listening, too, but his anger and frustration was nearly all-consuming. Even when he tried to mentally distance himself from the situation, he could still feel them nibbling away at the back of his mind, like some sort of parasite.\u00a0To keep himself under control, he just blotted\u00a0out the conversation.</p>\n<p>Then, he and his mom were finally on the road, driving back to UA. The weather outside was beautiful, and it wasn't fucking fair that nature was in such a good mood on what was already starting to be one of the top five worst days of his life. Mom had been running her mouth since they had left the hospital, nagging him non-stop about the same exact shit that the doctor had just told them before,\u00a0except this time it was all but impossible to block out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father should be calling the school now, making arrangements for us to meet with the principal and the nurse, as well as some of your teachers, so they know how to best help you. That'll happen later today or tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHm.\u201d\u00a0As long as he didn't have to sit through that meeting, as long as he didn't have to endure the stares of pity or disgust or confusion from his teachers, then he couldn't complain. His parents could do whatever the hell they wanted.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd remember \u2013 I know you have some deep-seated hatred against feelings, but you have to be responsible. Technically, school policy says that students need to take prescriptions with the nurse present to make sure that it's taken properly, but for you they\u2019re allowing an exception. You better not abuse that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s eyes flickered down to the backpack that was by his feet \u2013 where his medication was. A capsule, taken once in the morning and up to two other times a day as needed. As for how it worked, Katsuki didn\u2019t know and he didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>His mom seemed like she was waiting for a response, so \u201cyeah, yeah,\u201d was all he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour homeroom teacher has been warned in advance. This first week, your respiratory system will be compromised until the medicine kicks in, so you better keep the workouts light, ya hear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki glanced out the window, watching the gates of the school approach. Their car was let through.\u00a0They pulled pulled to a stop on a round-about outside the main quad, and his mom shifted the gear to park. Finally, he was here. Katsuki grabbed a strap of his backpack with one hand and reached for the door handle with the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got all of your school books? Your medicine?\u201d</p>\n<p>He grunted before swinging the door open, stepping out of the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd remember, you already took some this morning, so hold off for a while\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in training, go easy on yourself, for a week at least\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I know\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014And, you have a phone so if anything happens, you call right away, ya hear? Or even just, fucking, text every once in a while, for goodness\u2019 sake\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I fucking heard all of this the first three times, <em>Christ</em>, woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Katsuki</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He turned, leaning down to look through the door, thoroughly pissed.</p>\n<p>And Mom\u2026 she didn\u2019t look right. Her face was all sunken in with worried, more than he was used to her letting show. He didn\u2019t like it.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust, call if you need anything, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tch-ed. \u201cIf I say yes, will you fucking get off my back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d she rolled her eyes, amused, shifting into drive, \u201cSee you later, kid. Study hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki slammed the door and slung the backpack over his shoulder, listening as the car sped off, taking in the academic scene in front of him. He heaved a sigh.</p>\n<p>Plus Fucking Ultra, or whatever.</p>\n<p>Once Katsuki entered the school grounds, he made it\u00a0a full eight minutes before\u00a0 he was coughing up petals in a bathroom. The moment he had walked into the cafeteria, he had spotted a blaze of red hair across the way, and rather than spend the end of lunch break getting a meal, Katsuki found himself hunched over a fucking toilet. <em>Again</em>. And it wasn\u2019t like he could take another pill so soon after he had taken his first one. Fuck.</p>\n<p>Once the episode had passed, Katsuki settled for a few gyoza from the cafeteria, something he could eat in the short lunchtime that he had left. Sure enough, soon after he had finished, the bell rang, and it was time for class. He made his way down the hallways, avoiding anyone he recognized, being sure to trudge into\u00a0the classroom\u00a0at the last possible second, planting himself in the seat just as the lesson began. The less time to interact with his classmates, the better, and avoiding Kirishima like the plague seemed like a solid plan in general, even if his parents were completely and totally wrong about the whole...\u00a0<em>love</em> thing. With Katsuki\u2019s desk being at the front of the room without a single strand of red hair to gaze upon, that afternoon\u2019s classes went by without incident. Could have been a lot worse.</p>\n<p>But then came their training.</p>\n<p>It was a Monday, their most warm-up heavy day. After throwing on his gym clothes, Katsuki made his way out to the gymnasium, fully prepared to work his way through their routine stretches. But before he could make a space for himself on the floor mats, Aizawa approached him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, you\u2019ll sit out for today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously? All of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa gave a curt nod. \u201cDoctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, the doctor did say that some bullshit like this would happen, so Katsuki had been expecting it. But that didn\u2019t make it any less frustrating.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just warm-ups,\u201d he grumbled through clenched teeth.</p>\n<p>But Aizawa\u2019s look was stern, and he handed over a packet of make-up work from earlier that day, motioning to a lone chair in the far corner of the gymnasium.</p>\n<p>Katsuki literally wanted nothing more than to say \u2018fuck that\u2019 and blast through exercises and training like it was nothing. Like he knew he could. But when Katsuki glanced over to his chattering classmates, as one voice singled itself out over the crowd, loud and cheery and obnoxious, \u201c<em>what did you guys get up to this weekend?</em>\u201d, he could feel his lungs practically shudder. He turned back to Aizawa, grudgingly snatched the paper out of his hands, and sulked over to the sidelines.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To put it plainly, Kirishima wasn\u2019t helping matters a single fucking bit. The guy was pushy, always asking to be tutored, or to go sparring, or to play video games, or watch a movie, or fuck-all. Which, certainly wasn\u2019t out of character for him, and before this whole ordeal had started, Katsuki would occasionally accept his offers because he had nothing better to do.</p>\n<p>But right after that Monday\u2019s training, while Katsuki gathered his things, Kirishima approached him to ask for god-knows-what, and the sensations in his chest were so strong that Katsuki had no choice but to push the redhead aside and storm away in a mad search for a trashcan, or some paper towels. He had to run away. There wasn\u2019t really another way to put it. He was running away. Pathetic.</p>\n<p>And it wasn\u2019t like that was the only time it happened that day, either. Outside of the classroom, there wasn\u2019t much for Katsuki to focus his mind on, so it was easier for his thoughts to get distracted, his own damn mind wandering without his control, and then he\u2019d start thinking about fucking bullshit, embarrassing bullshit that he would deny well into the grave. And then he'd have to dart to his bathroom.</p>\n<p>Not to mention that the universe was a complete and utter sadist, and had some twisted sense of humor too, since their dorms were right fucking next to each other. Before, it hadn\u2019t bothered him too much, it was better to have Kirishima as a neighbor than <em>literally</em> anyone else. But now, it was the fucking bane of his existence.</p>\n<p>Because now, every time Kirishima knocked on his door to ask for help with a chemistry problem \u2013 petals.</p>\n<p>Every time he heard Kirishima\u2019s trash workout music playing a little too loudly through the wall \u2013 petals.</p>\n<p><em>Every fucking time</em> he heard one of Kirishima\u2019s doors open, for any goddamn reason, at all, even if it was just him going to go take a goddamn piss \u2013 fucking petals.</p>\n<p>Honestly, at this point in the day it felt like nothing had changed at all. The petals were unrelenting, setting off at the smallest thing, and there was only so much medicine he could take to counter them. Hell, with how shitty just this first day had been, he wasn\u2019t even sure if the medicine was helping a single bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Tuesday morning, Katsuki was late for class. And not for some vaguely excusable reason either, he just had the worst timing in the goddamn world. He and Kirishima had walked out of their rooms to head to class at the same time, making Katsuki dart back into his room, slam the door behind him, and wait for the coughing fit to pass. At this rate, Kirishima was going to start <em>worrying </em>about him or some shit. No training that day either. And he still didn't know if the medicine was working,</p>\n<p>\"<em>These things take time</em>\". He did remember the doctor saying that. But Katsuki couldn't afford to just wait around. He had things to do. He had a life to live, a future to prepare for. How long was time going to take?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wednesday went by alright, all things considered. Only three incidences happened at school \u2013 only one was during an actual class during some group activity, one happened during a break, and the last while he was sitting out, watching everyone else train. Maybe, since he could take his medicine up to three times a day, the petals were becoming a lot easier to manage?</p>\n<p>Although, it was getting more and more difficult ignoring his fucking nosey classmates. Katsuki could just tell they were already wondering about him, all hushed behind his back.</p>\n<p>He heard them, sometimes. The curious whispers under their breaths as he walked back into the classroom after a mad dash to the toilets. The snooping glances thrown his way during lunch. The concerned expressions he got as he sat, stuck in the sidelines watching everyone else train their bodies and quirks every afternoon. It was frustrating, enough to make his knuckles turn white and his jaw hurt. So, he ignored them, let their whispering bade to the background.</p>\n<p>He especially ignored Kirishima. Or at least, he tried to. He seemed to be at least somewhat successful in that regard. Even after the school day, the petals seemed to have lessened, but it was too soon to say if it was the medication\u2019s doing, or if he was just getting really good at avoiding Kirishima despite the red-head\u2019s relentless attempts to flag him down at literally every fucking opportunity. Maybe the guy was just finally taking a hint.</p>\n<p>All of that to say, it could have been a lot worse. But it was still pretty damn shitty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thursday went by much the same. There weren\u2019t as many petals, which should have been a relief, but the fact that they were still happening at all seemed to be presenting a new problem.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Katsuki was supposed to be slowly reintroduced to the training schedule. Per doctor\u2019s orders (and the permission of his parents and administration), the first few days were to remain largely exercise-free, no warm-ups or anything. But as his condition improved, Katsuki should have been allowed to rejoin the class during their more minor drills, at Aizawa\u2019s discretion.\u00a0But, as the school week was coming to an end, and even as Katsuki\u2019s incidences became relatively few, it was becoming clear that Aizawa had no intention of allowing him to join the class anytime soon. Seems as though training wasn\u2019t going to happen at all until the petals stopped completely.</p>\n<p>Which, was complete horseshit. His medicine was working, wasn\u2019t it? There was no way it was just some sort of fucking placebo effect. Hell, even if it was all in his mind, the petals were going away regardless, and that had to count for something, right? He should be able to work out, train, be around the other students, even stupid redheaded ones, and he should still be alright.</p>\n<p>Though, would he really be alright around Kirishima? There was really only one way to know for sure, but it wasn\u2019t like Katsuki was going to go out of his way to make it happen. He would just have to wait for the opportunity to present itself. And, knowing Kirishima, that probably wouldn\u2019t take too long. The guy was persistent, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, fucking, <em>lo and behold</em>, that Thursday afternoon, Kirishima finally managed to get him cornered.</p>\n<p>Katsuki was moping around in the school locker room, waiting for it to clear out so he could put on his outdoor shoes in peace. Most of the other students were gone already, and he was just rummaging around his locker when he saw a flash of red appear next to him.</p>\n<p>He looked over the locker door that was swung open, and saw Kirishima leaning with his back against the lockers, looking straight ahead of himself. His expression was... contemplative. Or, reflective.</p>\n<p>And his stomach was fluttering, and twisting in knots, and it was so goddamn uncomfortable, but Katsuki tried his best to push it all down. It felt like he was challenging fate or something, being in Kirishima\u2019s presence and refusing to let the petals consume him through sheer force of will and medication alone. He looked away from Kirishima, focused on getting his backpack out of the locker, and that helped ebb the discomfort.</p>\n<p>After a little hesitation, Kirishima finally spoke up, his voice uncharacteristically soft. \u201cSure miss sparring against you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the sound of that voice, it was doing things to Katsuki\u2019s chest just like it had before. His heart was beating, too quickly to be normal. He could feel his breath coming a bit short, his stomach fluttering. But there was something else there too, something new. It was like cotton filling his brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d was all he could say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should do that again sometime soon. Sparring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeahhh, that wasn\u2019t going to happen until he got better. Katsuki gritted his teeth at the bitter reminder, but just hummed again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Kirishima said, tilting his head to the side, a curious pout on his lips, \u201cYou seem a bit different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, you're just more\u2026 mellow? Chill? If that makes sense? You don\u2019t seem to be as\u2026 <em>feisty</em> as you usually are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki slammed his locker shut as hard as he could, making Kirishima jump a bit. \u201cI\u2019m always fucking chill,\u201d he deadpan-ed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhaha, sure you are,\u201d Kirishima snorted.</p>\n<p>And this mindless conversation, something like banter between the two... this was something he could do now. He could hold a conversation, and the petals weren't coming.\u00a0That was an improvement, right?</p>\n<p>As a silence swept over them, Kirishima settled for looking down to the floor, as if contemplating the words that were on the tip of his tongue. Finally, his voice cut through the quiet. \u201cBakugou, is something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>And here comes the question.</p>\n<p>Katsuki turned to him, lips pursed. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno, er\u2026 nothing. Never mind. Well,\u201d Kirishima pushed his shoulder off of the lockers and grabbed at the book-bag that he had placed by his feet. \u201cI hope to see you back in training soon, \u2018kay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, getting Kirishima off of his back had been a lot easier than expected. But no doubt the guy would be asking again sometime soon.</p>\n<p>And as Kirishima walked away, leaving him alone, there was the twisting, ever so faint, and a slight tickle at the back of his throat. But there was also the\u00a0cotton in his head, the static. And there were no petals.</p>\n<p>That was something that Katsuki should have felt really happy about, because <em>fucking finally</em>. Finally, he could get through some sort of an interaction with Kirishima, without that fucking disgusting flowery shit deciding to ruin his fucking day. It should have felt like a triumph.</p>\n<p>But honestly, it didn\u2019t feel all that exciting. Everything was just a little\u2026 dull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As that first week came to an end, the incidences still happened occasionally, maybe twice a day at most, but they were less severe. Katsuki even found that carrying around a couple tissues was all he needed to take care of a few of the weaker coughing fits. That was a relief, since the convenience meant he didn\u2019t cause a scene making a getaway from wherever he happened to be at the time, and he didn't have to worry about his classmates seeing him take some strange pill in the middle of class. The types of questions that could bring up, were not the type of questions he ever wanted to deal with.</p>\n<p>But something that was weird about these final petering of petals, was that they could happen at any time. Katsuki wasn\u2019t stupid \u2013 even if his parents had it all wrong, even if he didn\u2019t feel like<em> that</em> about Kirishima, something about the guy was definitely the source of the coughing. Or, at least, the guy had been. Now, the petals fell whenever they goddamn pleased, which was a bit more annoying. They weren\u2019t as predictable when they were like this. But, he figured that meant the last surviving petals were clearing themselves out of his system by any means possible. So, while Katsuki could no longer control the petals simply by avoiding Kirishima, that also meant that he could stand being in Kirishima\u2019s presence for longer than five minutes. Not that he wanted to. But, he could. If he did want to. Which, he didn't.</p>\n<p>Sometimes he could still feel the discomfort in his chest, and whatever that cottony static in his brain was, was becoming a lot more prevalent. It was annoying. But his throat no longer felt constantly scratchy and raw, and Katsuki didn\u2019t have to smell or taste fucking <em>roses</em> all the goddamn time, which was nearly all he could have asked for.</p>\n<p>Now, all he needed was for Aizawa to let him train already.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The time came soon enough. At the beginning of the following week, with the petals dwindling to nearly non-existent, Aizawa actually let Katsuki join the class for their pre-training stretches and warm-ups. It was finally a little progress, one step closer to being back on the hero track. But then Wednesday rolled around, and god-knows-what set off a flurry of petals in Algebra, and word must have passed on to Aizawa in the teacher\u2019s break room because Katsuki was forced to sit in the sidelines again that afternoon.</p>\n<p>It was so goddamn frustrating. Katsuki knew he could be doing more. Knew he <em>should</em> be doing more. But for some reason, Aizawa was still holding him back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That evening, there was a knock on his door.</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked up from his phone, staring the door down as if sheer willpower alone would be enough to send the person away.</p>\n<p>They knocked again.</p>\n<p>With a groan, he rolled out of bed and shuffled his way to the door, swinging it open. And it was Kirishima, because, well, of course it fucking was.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Bakugou!\u201d He grinned, pointy teeth blinding.</p>\n<p>Katsuki took a deep breath through his nose. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry to bother you so late, but, well\u2026 I\u2019m really stressing out about that Algebra quiz on Friday.\u201d He held up a notebook and a pencil. \u201cThink you could help a bro out?\u201d</p>\n<p>The guy wanted tutoring. Figures. Katsuki\u2019s first thought was a definite \u2018No\u2019, a tutoring session was how all of this had started, and he\u2019d be damned if a tutoring session made it all go to shit again. But, the discomfort in his chest, the one that he had come to expect every time he laid eyes on Kirishima... for the first time in a long time, it didn\u2019t happen. At all. No speeding heartbeat, no burning, no churning or twisting or anything. Just that static in his mind.</p>\n<p>Huh.</p>\n<p>Maybe\u2026 maybe a tutoring session with Kirishima wasn\u2019t such a bad idea? Maybe, this was just the opportunity that he needed to test the strength of his medicine. Not to mention that maybe, if he got more used to Kirishima\u2019s presence, seeing him in class or in training wouldn\u2019t throw him off guard as much. Maybe, he could avoid future incidences, especially ones that Aizawa could hear about. Plus, he had literally nothing better to do.</p>\n<p>So Katsuki shrugged, \u201cWhatever.\u201d He turned on his heel, leaving the door open behind him. \u201cJust don\u2019t piss me off by getting distracted by cat videos again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, that was one time!\u201d Kirishima laughed, boldly following him into the room.</p>\n<p>Thus, their studying began. At first, it felt like nothing was wrong, like none of this roses bullshit had happened. It was a small taste, a slight reminder of normalcy. Even after nearly an hour and a half of drilling equations and talking through word problems, there was not a single sign of the petals.</p>\n<p>Just the static.</p>\n<p>Kirishima had more-or-less gotten a hang of the material, so they were about to wrap things up. But, as the guy was gathering his things to head back to his room, he hesitated.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh. Bakugou?\u201d He began.</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked up to him. \u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to bring it up again, and maybe I shouldn\u2019t, but\u2026\u201d He turned to Katsuki, slowly meeting his eyes. \u201cAre you... okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>And goddamn, he had called it. He knew another\u00a0conversation like this would happen eventually. Katsuki just pursed his lips. \u201cYeah\u2026? Should I not be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cNo, no, not that, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Kirishima\u2019s shoulders fell in some sort of defeat. \u201cI dunno, it\u2019s probably stupid but, I\u2019ve been worried about you a lot lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a week or two ago, you were acting all funny. You kept leaving classes, and training. You didn\u2019t look too well, you apparently got so sick that you had to <em>go home</em>, when we have Recovery Girl here! I was\u2026 super concerned.\u201d Kirishima shrugged, but he went quiet, as if waiting for an answer.</p>\n<p>Katsuki didn\u2019t want to respond. Maybe it was that he <em>couldn't</em> respond, he didn\u2019t know. But regardless, his silence only encouraged Kirishima to speak more.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a while there you weren\u2019t talking to me either, or to anyone else,\u201d The redhead scratched at his chin. \u201cWhich, I suppose isn\u2019t too unusual for you, but it almost seemed like you were <em>avoiding</em> me. You haven\u2019t been training that much, most of the time Mr. Aizawa won\u2019t even let you. Even today, these past few hours, you... you haven't been acting like yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Katsuki managed to grumble out. \u201cIt\u2019s not your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut as your bro, I\u2019m making it my business.\u201d The look on his face was determined, resolute, but his voice was so soft. \u201cWhat happened? Is\u2026 is there something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki could only stare blankly at him. He didn\u2019t have to answer, he knew that. He had never told anyone before, he didn\u2019t want to ever have to. But the room was so quiet, filled with Kirishima\u2019s worry nearly palpable in the air. It was so much. Katsuki closed his eyes, let out a slow breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d he answered plainly, voice breaking for just a moment. \u201cReally sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kirishima froze at that, his lips downturned, eyebrows creased in concern. \u201c\u2026Is it serious?\u201d he finally managed to ask in a low whisper. \u201cLike\u2026 just how \u2018really sick\u2019 are we talking here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s whatever. It\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kirishima blinked.</p>\n<p>Katsuki's nonchalance seemed to simultaneously relieve and and perplex him. The blond had hoped it had be enough to ease his curiosity, but with the way Kirishima was lingering, teeth gnawing at his bottom lip, he could just tell that he had created more questions than answers. Questions that he didn't want to talk about. So he stay put, sitting in his chair, watching his fidgeting fingers. Waiting for Kirishima to take his cue to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou\u2026\u201d Kirishima began, and\u00a0it suddenly struck Katsuki just\u00a0how close they were. How close their shoulders were to brushing against each other. \u201c We've been through a lot together, right?\"</p>\n<p>That they had. Katsuki thought back to the USJ. Back to the training camp. Back to his rescue from the villains. Memories that used to fill him up with emotions, so many that it was overwhelming. Frustration at not being able to overcome on his own. Relief at being saved. The feeling like he had finally found someone he could rely on, and confide in, for the first time in his life.\u00a0It was all\u00a0replaced by static.</p>\n<p>\"And after all of that...\" Kirishima was searching his eyes. Searching his soul. \"You do know I care about you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He could only shrug. The static in his head was jarring, overwhelming all of his other emotions. Why was it there? Why did it feel like he was losing something?</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, I don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re going through, and you don\u2019t have to tell me or anything. But, I want to help you if I can. Is there anything I can do?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Stay away,</em> his mind was screaming at him to answer. <em>Stay far away from me so I don\u2019t have to deal with any of that shit ever again.</em></p>\n<p>But his mouth mumbled something different. \u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d Somehow, Katsuki managed to break the hypnotizing gaze, effectively breaking whatever private moment had formed between them. \u201cThe medicine\u2019s already working.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slid his chair back, standing out of it and walking to put his textbook back on his bookshelf.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s\u2026 uh, good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kirishima chirped up from behind him. \u201cI\u2019m glad. If you\u2019re alright, then that\u2019s all that matters!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki still wasn\u2019t looking at him, but he practically could hear the smile that formed on the guy\u2019s lips. He couldn\u2019t hear if it was genuine or not.</p>\n<p>Even though they had been so close, even with the words that Kirishima was saying, there still wasn\u2019t a speeding heartbeat. There wasn\u2019t the burning, or the churning, or the twisting, or anything. Just static.</p>\n<p>Just numb.</p>\n<p>Katsuki felt numb.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That Friday, their class was working with All Might. It was one of the first times that they trained with him after Kamino, and it was still strange hearing his distinguished if not more reserved voice coming from such a small form. But that didn\u2019t matter. What mattered, was that All Might was letting Katsuki train.</p>\n<p>Or rather, when Katsuki joined warm-ups, All Might didn\u2019t say that he couldn\u2019t. And when he followed the rest of the class out onto the gymnasium floor, All Might didn\u2019t hand him a packet of extra schoolwork and demand that he sit in the sidelines. Aizawa wasn\u2019t there to correct him, and Katsuki wasn\u2019t going to either.</p>\n<p>It was the last Friday of the month, anyways \u2013 they always did a fun exercise, as if to celebrate a month of hard work. It usually wasn\u2019t anything too strenuous, just little competitions and things to keep the class\u2019 spirit high. In fact, they were usually pretty dumb, not the type of thing to take seriously. But it wouldn\u2019t be anything Katsuki couldn\u2019t handle.</p>\n<p>As the class waited around for All Might\u2019s instructions, someone gave Katsuki\u2019s back a large pat. He turned quickly, hands smoking and ready to explode a dumbass. But it was just Kirishima, all smiley and bright. The redhead slung his arms around Katsuki\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad you could join us today!\u201d he beamed. \"Been a long time coming!\"</p>\n<p>And a week or so before, something like that would have definitely caused a coughing fit. But, Katsuki felt fine.</p>\n<p>So far, so good.</p>\n<p>While his classmates were starting to bounce with anticipation, wondering what today\u2019s exercise would be, Katsuki was just relieved to even be there. After nearly two weeks of being left and forgotten about at the sidelines, just the thought of <em>finally</em> being able to flex his muscles, and fire off his quirk again, without some fucking petals holding him back\u2026 it was liberating.</p>\n<p>As they were split randomly into two teams, and as All Might placed foam balls in the center of the court between groups, the rest of the class was so abuzz that All Might had to raise his arms and call for them to quiet down. With several harsh \u2018shhh\u2019s, the students finally calmed down, watching curiously as All Might got this amused glint in his eye. Then, he spoke four little words: \u201c<em>Quirk Dodge-ball. Go!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>And the class erupted into absolute chaos.</p>\n<p>And <em>holy shit</em>, this was going to be a fucking mess. But at least it was something Katsuki could be a little excited about. When Katsuki played dodge-ball, he was absolutely ruthless. There was only one winner in dodge-ball, and\u00a0he would honestly do just about anything to make sure that it was him. And in a version where quirks were allowed...</p>\n<p>The first few seconds started out tame enough. Well, as tame as 20 teenagers with superpowers could be when playing a cutthroat match of dodge-ball.\u00a0But it was in those preliminary few seconds that several\u00a0were wasting time trying to figure out how to best use their quirks to simultaneously throw and avoid projectiles. But for Katsuki, that came easily enough. He could use his quirk\u2019s mobility to dodge, while adding firepower to every throw. Simple. With a strategy already planned out, he was sure to use his opponents' hesitation as an advantage. After gathering his first armful of ammunition, he blasted to the side to dodge an incoming projectile, using his momentum to carry him towards he closest enemy. He swung his arm over-hand and fired.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cKouda is out! Better luck next match!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Just like that, 20 seconds into the match, and he had gotten the first kill. And <em>god</em> did it feel good. Finally. Fucking finally.</p>\n<p>It didn't take long for the rest of the class to start stepping up their game. As a general rule, Katsuki tried to block everyone else, only focus on his targets, but some of his classmate\u2019s quirk uses were admittedly very clever.</p>\n<p>Like on the opposing team, the stupid-looking guy with the grapes on his head had managed to stick one of his own teammates to the floor, so she couldn\u2019t leave the court even after she got hit, and he started using the\u00a0her like a shield. At one point, someone was making a literal <em>cannon</em>, which was pretty damn cool, but she was hit right before it was completed. It was too bad, half of Katsuki kinda wanted to see if it would work.</p>\n<p>But when Todoroki\u00a0figured out that he could throw\u00a0ignited dodge-balls at the other team, it was a total game changer. He wasn\u2019t even trying to hit anyone, that bastard was <em>herding</em> them, making it easier for their team to pick off the scattering enemies one by one. That strategy worked pretty solidly for the first half of the game, and Katsuki took advantage of it, managing to hit three more opponents. And the rush of adrenaline coursing through his veins, the feel of his body exerting itself for the first time in such a long time\u2026 it was just a stupid game of dodge-ball, but he felt\u00a0alive.</p>\n<p>But then the icy-hot dumbass let his guard down and somehow, <em>fucking Deku </em>nailed him right in the face. Katsuki would have laughed if it Todoroki hadn\u2019t been his own teammate.</p>\n<p>It all went downhill from there. The teams had been pretty even up to that point, but without the fireballs raining down on them, the opposing team could actually focus on offense rather than defense. Then, the octopus guy\u00a0took the opportunity to use all of his hands\u00a0to throw a ton of dodge-balls at once,\u00a0wiping out pretty much all of Katsuki's team. The\u00a0only reason Katsuki had survived was because that invisible girl happened to be standing right in front of him.</p>\n<p>And just like that, it was Katsuki versus Octopus Guy, and a few of his remaining cronies.</p>\n<p>While the two sides spent a moment catching their breaths, the rest of the class was cheering from the sidelines, so loud and obnoxious that it was starting to give him a splitting headache. Above all, Katsuki could hear Kirishima\u2019s voice, wishing him good luck. It was really fucking annoying. Now, he just wanted the game to be over with, he needed to rest. Which was bullshit, it was just dodge-ball and he should not have felt so winded. But that's Hanahaki for ya. If only he could take out octopus guy, who was really fucking huge so it shouldn\u2019t have been that difficult a challenge, all he needed was a dodge-ball. But, Katsuki's feet weren't exactly cooperating, and his head was starting to ache.</p>\n<p>Octopus guy's remaining teammates were too busy gathering every dodge-ball they could find, and rather than possibly wasting a few shots trying to hit Katsuki, they were handing them off to their teammate, who was taking one in each hand, and <em>shit</em>\u00a0it was time to dodge.</p>\n<p>In a split second, Katsuki followed his gut instinct and blasted to the air, explosions from alternating hands keeping him balanced and off the ground. It was a good thing the ceiling was so high, all the more room to maneuver. It seemed like a good idea at first \u2013 this way, he could move faster in a larger area, making himself a lot harder to hit. And it did work at first -- the first three attempts to hit him were unsuccessful. But as the cheers from his classmates got louder and louder, the headache would not go away. In fact, it seemed like the more he moved around, propelling through the air, the more light-headed he felt. He tried to ignore it, push it to the back of his mind, focus on dodging, holding out until they ran out of ammunition, his sights set on victory.</p>\n<p>But then came the fourth brutal attack, coming straight toward him, and he positioned his hands underneath him, shooting himself upwards to get out of the way, going nearly as high as he could go, and that set his head spinning. Something was wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, up felt down, left felt right, the dizziness, the disorientation, it was too much, he couldn\u2019t get his bearings, the room spinning so quickly that he felt like he would actually be sick to his stomach.</p>\n<p>There was only the feeling of flying, then the feeling of falling, the sounds of concerned shouts from somewhere far away, growing louder and closer with each millisecond. With eyes squeezed shut, Katsuki could only\u00a0surround his head with his arms, tucking his legs to his chest, brace himself for an impact that he knew was coming.</p>\n<p>He felt himself collide, felt his body skid across the floor. He felt his bones creak, muscles shake, head pounding and pounding and<em> pounding.</em></p>\n<p>And the world faded to black.</p>\n<p>Everything hurt. His chest ached, head thrumming, pulsing, thoughts jumbled by the pain. But above all, he was exhausted.</p>\n<p>As his senses slowly came to him, Katsuki could start making out voices. They were far away, like he was trying to hear them from under water, their words hard to grasp, not retaining any meaning. But their tones sounded urgent, and the more he focused on them, the louder and clearer they seemed to become, eventually anchoring him back into reality.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026it\u2019s true that I knew about his condition, and if I had known of the severity of the side effects as well, I would not have let him participate in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>That voice was low, soft-spoken and nearly unfamiliar. Yet somehow, it was unmistakably All Might\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Someone else sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly alright, you didn\u2019t know.\u201d This voice belonged to someone he recognized, too. A woman.</p>\n<p>\u201cI truly am sorry, Recovery Girl. You as well, Aizawa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me you should be apologizing to,\u201d a third voice mumbled, tired and gravely. \u201cLook, he\u2019s finally coming around.\u201d</p>\n<p>As his motor skills finally came to him, Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but let out a groan. He finally opened his eyes, squinting at the bright lights of his surroundings. Sure enough, he was lying down in the nurse\u2019s office, white and pristine, flushed orange by the sunlight outside. Three pairs of eyes were trailed onto him. Katsuki couldn\u2019t look, couldn\u2019t bring himself to see their pity staring back at him.</p>\n<p>Of the three adults in the room, Recovery Girl was the first to speak up. \u201cYoung man, can you tell me why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Katsuki trailed off, swallowing, wracking his brain for answers. Sensations, images, flashed into his head one by one as the memory came back to him in full. The dodge-ball match. The dizziness. The impact. Well, that certainly explained this fucking insufferable headache. He shut his eyes again, grimacing. \u201cI fell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. And, your name, age, and school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou Katsuki. Fifteen. UA.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, lift both of your arms in front of you, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He did.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow lower them. And, blink a few times for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He did.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Recovery Girl swiveled to her computer, typing. \u201cYou must have hit your head pretty hard back there. You had a broken nose, a dislocated shoulder, and one of your elbows got shattered. The bruises and fractures in your ribs were not a pretty sight, either.\u201d She shook her head, tutting. \u201cWith how All Might described you slamming into the ground like that\u2026 I\u2019ve seen much worse, but you\u2019re quite lucky that you passed out afterwards. You managed to avoid feeling the worst of the pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Katsuki blinked a few times, trying to take it all in, but the words were swimming around in his head. When he finally started grasping them, he looked to his shoulders. Moved them a bit. They felt fine now. So did his nose, and elbows, and torso. The aching was still everywhere, and he was utterly worn out, but he could move.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny traumatic brain injuries you might have gotten seem to have healed already,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut if you start to notice your memory acting funny in the next few days, be sure to stop by and I\u2019ll treat you again. Other than that, you\u2019ve made a full recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the flowers?\u201d The question had left his mouth before he had a chance to stop it.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl tilted her head to the side. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you heal the flowers? Are they gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaned back in her chair, resting her clasped hands in her lap, a curious expression on her face. Her voice turned low. \u201cHanahaki is just as much a physical disorder as it is a psychological one. My quirk could help your body deal with any resulting harm, like internal bleeding, should the flowers get too out of control. But I can\u2019t cure you.\u201d Recovery Girl shook her head. \u201cNot to worry! The flowers seem to be dormant now, so your medicine is working just fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Slowly, Katsuki pushed himself off of the cot, swinging his legs over until his feet touched the floor. He couldn\u2019t help but let out another long groan, bringing a hand to his temple. Fuck, now his head was spinning again.</p>\n<p>After typing a few final details to the report, Recovery Girl swiveled her chair around so she could face the teachers. \u201cI suppose this just goes to show how even the fun training exercises can go wrong.\u201d She let out a resigned sigh. \u201cNow All Might, what do you have to say for yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might took a step forward, his voice gentle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened today, young Bakugou. I wasn\u2019t fully aware of how your treatment was affecting you. It was negligent of me to let you go straight into training in that condition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki stayed staring forward, his hands balled up into fists on his lap, jaw set. He said nothing.</p>\n<p>It was then that Aizawa cleared his throat. \u201cThis is why I\u2019ve been overly cautious so far. Holding you back on training seemed like the most rational thing to do, at least until we know the full side-effects of your medication.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the side-effects are?\u201d Katsuki finally managed to rasp out through his clenched teeth. \u201cWhat happened to me back there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVertigo,\u201d Recovery Girl spoke up from her desk, her voice firm and composed. \u201cYour treatment affects the consistency of the fluid in your inner ear, causing disorientation. It\u2019s a pretty common effect for this type of medication. Until your brain gets used to it, you should probably avoid using your quirk for mobility. More strenuous exercises should be avoided as well, in case you get dizzy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re not gonna be training any time soon,\u201d Aizawa mumbled from behind his scarf. \u201cNot for a few more weeks, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those words pounded in his head, again and again, like a final nail being driven into a coffin. Katsuki looked down. Even after all of this, and he still couldn\u2019t train. He felt the frustration boiling underneath the surface of his skin, anger and resentment all rumbling like a monster ready to awaken at any moment.</p>\n<p>But it was subdued. Muted. Numb.</p>\n<p>Numb, numb, numb.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be all set now, but you\u2019ll be tired from my quirk, so take it easy for the rest of the day,\u201d Recovery Girl reminded him. \u201cOne of your classmates has offered to walk you back to the dorms.\u201d</p>\n<p>Great, now he couldn\u2019t even walk without supervision? It was already too much to begin with, but now this? Damn. Katsuki could feel his nails digging into the palms of his hands. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to acknowledge Recovery Girl, or any of his teachers, or their words. Could only keep staring into the distance.</p>\n<p>Numb.</p>\n<p>With a nod from Recovery Girl, Aizawa opened the door, allowing a new figure from the hallway to enter the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki snapped his head up in alarm, frozen like a deer in headlights. Red eyes smiled back at him. Pointy teeth, spiky hair.</p>\n<p>The universe was definitely mocking him now.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, you two,\u201d Aizawa began as he continued to hold the door open. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. We teachers still have some things to discuss, not to mention your parents to update.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki glanced out of the window behind him. The sun was hanging lower in the sky \u2013 late afternoon. How long had he been out? And just how long had Kirishima been waiting for him?</p>\n<p>But his coughing really did seem to be completely under control. And, as much as he wasn\u2019t in the mood to see Kirishima right now, he didn\u2019t have much of a choice. So with one last, apprehensive look in the redhead\u2019s direction, Katsuki pushed himself to his feet and shuffled to the doorway.</p>\n<p>As they entered the corridor, the door closed behind them, leaving them completely alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, I got your school bag for you!\u201d Kirishima started, not allowing any sort of silence to envelop them for more than a single second. He grabbed the backpack from one of the waiting chairs in the hallway. As he held it out, he smiled, but there was some underlying tension, something straining his expression. He looked\u2026 tired.</p>\n<p>Without a word, Katsuki took the bag by the strap and slung it over his shoulder, making his way down the corridor ahead of Kirishima. Maybe if he created enough distance between them, the guy would take a hint and leave him alone.</p>\n<p>No such luck. Thinking nothing of the growing gap between them, Kirishima did a little jog to close the distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a clean uniform at your dorm?\u201d He asked as they fell into step.</p>\n<p>Katsuki let out a frustrated puff of hot air through his nose. \u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but you\u2019re still in your work-out uniform. I wasn\u2019t gonna root around your gym locker for your stuff, so today\u2019s school uniform is still there.\u201d</p>\n<p>As they reached the stairwell, Kirishima held out his arm, as if expecting Katsuki to take it for support. Katsuki ignored the offer and began down the stairs.</p>\n<p>Kirishima wasn\u2019t far behind. He was never far behind. And his voice was still just as cheery and insufferable as it ever was. \u201cSince you have a spare, we can just go straight to the dorms now. You can just grab the other one another time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki just grunted, stepping onto the landing, heading to the entryway lockers so he could put on his outdoor shoes. They had taken off his gym shoes, and walking around in just socks was plain weird. After rummaging around in his locker, he sat down on a bench and began unlacing his other pair.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d Katsuki finally managed to grumble out.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Kirishima took a seat next to him, his own pair of outdoor shoes in hand. \u201cAll Might actually ended training early. He managed to transform, just so he could take you to Recovery Girl himself. I think he felt pretty bad for not catching you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been out for\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout two hours, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, as they changed shoes, Kirishima did let silence take hold of them. The guy was worried, that much was obvious, but the resulting quiet was so stuffy. It made Katsuki feel uncomfortable, and restless. He wanted nothing more than to get away.</p>\n<p>But surprisingly, Kirishima was the first to push himself off of the bench and make his way to the door. Katsuki could only follow suit.</p>\n<p>The two made their way across campus to the dormitory. The air between them was filled with Kirishima\u2019s mindless rambling about this and that, their pace set by a slight hop in his step. On the surface, it was just like any other day after training. But there was something off about it, Katsuki could tell. There was a lag in Kirishima\u2019s step, too many uncomfortable pauses in his chatter. It was all a front. Kirishima\u2019s attempt to distract himself from his worry. And it wasn\u2019t working.</p>\n<p>And Katsuki wanted to be angry about it, too. There was no reason for Kirishima to worry about him, or to act differently around him because of it. It was bullshit. But so much of him just felt like not caring.</p>\n<p>As soon as they entered the dormitory common space, the room went quiet, and all eyes turned to them. Turned to Katsuki, focusing on him, gazes boring into him. Curiosity. Worry. Pity. He ducked his head and began making his way toward the stairwell, when Kirishima grabbed his forearm.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s take the elevator today.\u201d He kept his voice low, quiet enough that no one else would overhear. \u201cAizawa told me to make sure that you take things easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki huffed. Jesus fucking Christ, now he wasn\u2019t even allowed to take the fucking stairs. At this rate, he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to walk to his toilet by next week. But at the same time, he didn\u2019t have much of a fight left in him. So when Kirishima started steering him towards the elevator, he just let it happen. What else could he do?</p>\n<p>But as soon as the doors sealed shut, Kirishima turned to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d His voice was soft. Uncertain.</p>\n<p>And this was something Katsuki should have anticipated \u2013 Kirishima, once again, using their solitude as an opportunity to have some sort of conversation. A conversation that Katsuki was determined not to have. So he stared at a fixed point ahead of him, hoping to block everything out. Hoping to just ignore the problem away.</p>\n<p>But then there was a hand on his shoulder, tugging him back to his surroundings.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shook off the hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pull that \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 crap with me. I know you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a snap of his head, he turned to stare at Kirishima, eyes widened just a tad. Other people weren\u2019t usually so perceptive of his emotions. Hell, Katsuki wasn\u2019t usually so perceptive of his own emotions, either. But he quickly turned away, eyeing the floor numbers as they ascended, willing the elevator, or even time itself to go faster so he could escape far away from this.</p>\n<p>But escaping the elevator wouldn\u2019t escape the fact that Kirishima was right. He wasn\u2019t fine. Of course he wasn\u2019t, he had just dropped from 20 feet in the fucking air. He couldn\u2019t feel things like he used to, the numbing static in his brain wouldn\u2019t let him. He had some bullshit disorder that fucked up his body, made him cough fucking <em>flowers</em>. And he was cornered \u2013 between the Hanahaki and the stupid medicine, he couldn\u2019t fight. Couldn\u2019t train, no matter what he did. It was all sorts of fucked up, how was he supposed to be fine with any of it? What could he even do to fix it?</p>\n<p>But this whole <em>other people caring about him</em> thing wasn\u2019t something Katsuki was used to, either. It was uncomfortable. The elevator dinged, and as soon as the doors opened, Katsuki darted out of it, away from it all. But before he could make it to his dorm, retreat to the safe seclusion of his own room, Kirishima called after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not okay.\u201d His words carried over Katsuki\u2019s shoulder, making him stop in his tracks. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima\u2026\u201d he rumbled. A warning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean that your suffering is okay or anything! All I mean is, it\u2019s okay to be <em>not </em>okay, if that makes any sense\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima,\u201d Katsuki tried again, his voice turning dangerously low.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I want to say is\u2026 you don\u2019t have to pretend to be okay when you\u2019re not. Especially around me.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, the air between them turned still, as if each of them were holding their breaths, waiting for something. Anything. The tension between them was too much.</p>\n<p>Finally, Katsuki managed to let out a shaky breath. \u201cJust, drop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>There were soft footsteps behind him. \u201cBakugou\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Drop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a strong hand on his shoulder again, enough force to make Katsuki turn around in surprise. Then there were arms wrapped around him, Kirishima\u2019s chin resting on his shoulder. A proper hug. Katsuki froze, hands prepared to push away but brain first trying to process what was happening.</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou scared me today, okay?\u201d He cut in, his words muffled by Katsuki\u2019s shoulder, circling his arms tighter before Katsuki could push away. \u201cYou\u2019ve been scaring me all week. You still are, even now.\u201d</p>\n<p>That hug, so gentle, with Kirishima\u2019s hair against his nose, firm arms around his waist, a quiver in his voice as it shook with emotion\u2026 it should have been overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I know you don\u2019t want to talk about it, and that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>It should have made him feel a lot, just like he would have felt before.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m worried that you\u2019re bottling it up, not taking care of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He should have felt embarrassment. He should have felt infuriation. He should have felt confusion, and warmth, contentment. Gratitude. More than even that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re going through something tough, you don\u2019t have to go through it alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>He should have felt so much. <em>So fucking much</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cRight?\u201d Kirishima lifted his head to meet Katsuki\u2019s eyes, his brows drawn together in worry. \u201cRight, Bakugou?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki lowered his gaze. He searched within him for something, anything. An end to the static.</p>\n<p>With a grunt, he pushed Kirishima away. He opened his door and let it fall shut behind him.</p>\n<p>He felt nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c<em>Katsuki??</em>\u201d His mom\u2019s voice nearly shrieked through the phone.</p>\n<p>Katsuki winced at the sharp sound and pulled it away from his ear. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh my god, you actually picked up, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>He huffed at that. Surely it wasn\u2019t that fucking surprising? Katsuki swung his backpack onto his bed and sat down next to it. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The school called a while ago and explained everything.</em>\u201d She sounded\u2026 tightly-strung, to say the least. \u201c<em>They said you were healed up and fine now, but I wanted to hear it from you. You alright, kiddo?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rummaged around his bag for a bit, searching for something, the actions distracting him from his answer. Eventually, he let out a clipped \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You sure as hell don\u2019t sound fine.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Fucking hell, not with this again. Katsuki groaned. \u201cThis is just what I normally sound like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Maybe that\u2019s the problem,</em>\u201d his mom\u2019s sigh carried loud and clear through the phone. \u201c<em>Are you absolutely</em> sure<em> you\u2019re okay? You seem a bit\u2026 well, from how the nurse described your injuries, falling like that must have been not fun.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolled his eyes. \u201cRi-ight. I\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What? Don\u2019t\u2014 Fuck, Katsuki, I swear to God, I will march over there\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Fine, fine, fine, whatever, I won\u2019t! Sheesh.\u201d With a shake of his head, Katsuki turned his attention back to his bag, where he finally found his pill bottle in a side pocket.</p>\n<p>His mom sighed again. She\u2019d been sighing too much lately. \u201c<em>We haven\u2019t heard from you much, how\u2019s everything else been? How are the petals?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki stood from his bed and let out a stretch. \u201cThey\u2019re fucking fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 <em>Really?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019ve gone away already.\u201d He made his way to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u2019s\u2026 really nice to hear, actually.</em>\u201d This sigh was more in relief than anything. \u201c<em>Wish you\u2019d let us know earlier though, ya brat. Not like we\u2019re holding our breaths over here or anything.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Katsuki carefully shut the bathroom door behind him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0\u201cWell good news, the doctor said that you don\u2019t have to go to him for an appointment since UA\u2019s nurse handled everything.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>He took a second to examine the pill bottle\u2019s label, glancing through the side-effects, muttering a passive \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>And\u2014 oh hold on, your father\u2019s calling.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmhmm.\u201d He gave the bottle a little shake against his free ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c<em>I\u2019ll text you or something. You better text back, alright?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d He unscrewed the lid of the bottle, peering at the contents. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cBye.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHm. Bye.\u201d He hung up the phone, set it on the counter, held out the bottle in front of him.</p>\n<p>And dumped every last pill into the toilet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, nothing changed.</p>\n<p>Not Friday night, not Saturday morning. Not even Saturday evening, after an entire day of not taking any medication. With the chemicals still lingering in his system, it was probably too soon to notice any effects. But that night, sleep didn\u2019t come as easy as it normally did. Maybe it was withdrawals or something? Or maybe it had nothing to do with the medication, just one of those nights where sleep was nearly impossible. But it was the weekend. A little lack of sleep was the least of his worries. At least the petals were still at bay.</p>\n<p>Although that night, the thought did cross his mind once or twice that <em>maybe</em> what he had done hadn\u2019t been the best idea. Ignoring a doctor\u2019s instructions, stopping cold turkey on a medicine that he knew nothing about, that was supposed to cure him from a disease that he also knew nothing about\u2026 It wasn\u2019t exactly the smartest thing to do.</p>\n<p>Scratch that. He was a total dumb-fuck.</p>\n<p>But hey, what\u2019s done is done. There was nothing Katsuki could do about it now but hope for sleep to come. And in the early hours of the morning, he did finally manage to nod off.</p>\n<p>But, as Katsuki woke up to the bright light of late Sunday morning, it was like a circuit had switched inside his brain. It was like there was a pool of energy, his energy that had been frozen over without him even realizing it. And now, the surface was finally beginning to thaw.</p>\n<p>And by the end of the day, he was swimming in it.</p>\n<p>It made his heart race, just a bit. Made his legs bounce restlessly as he tried working on his homework. It was exhilarating, all of the energy that he used to have was coming back to him all at once. But with that energy, came the anger. The resentment. It was distracting. He needed to work it down to a manageable level.</p>\n<p>So Katsuki spent the rest of his Sunday afternoon drilling. Sit-ups, lunges, push-ups, jogging in place, jumping jacks, any reps that he could do in the small confides of his dorm, until sweat was dripping down his face and his muscles were worked to exhaustion. Anything that would elevate his sudden restlessness. Distract him from the all-encompassing frustration that was finally starting to creep back into his mind after so long.</p>\n<p>But even that wasn\u2019t enough. Warm-ups weren\u2019t going to catch him up to the other students. He needed more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which, as expected, Aizawa wasn\u2019t gonna let him do. That Monday afternoon, Katsuki was forced to sit in the sidelines again, working on alternative assignments while he watched his peers train. On a positive note, his grades had never been better. And his grades had always been really fucking good. All of the extra time to study the material and work on homework over the past few weeks had paid off, albeit in a small way.</p>\n<p>Yet all of that meant jack shit when he couldn\u2019t even do what he came to UA to do. If he wanted to be a regular student with regular classes and regular assignments and regular grades, he would have applied to fucking General Studies or something. But Katsuki sure as hell was not a regular student. He was supposed to be in the hero course, for fuck\u2019s sake. And at this point, he had absolutely nothing to show for it.</p>\n<p>But Katsuki\u2019s homeroom teacher had no say in what he did outside the classroom. And he had to do something, because at this rate, whatever compromises the school had made for him and his condition weren\u2019t gonna work.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how, that very evening, Katsuki found himself knocking on Kirishima\u2019s door.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t too often that Katsuki turned to people for help. But lately, if he ever entertained the idea, Kirishima was the first person to come to mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cComing, coming~\u201d</p>\n<p>The door opened, revealing Kirishima in sweats with a headband running across his forehead. The sight didn\u2019t have an effect on Katsuki. Not a sign of the flowers.</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s face immediately lit up. \u201cBakugou? Hey man, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna go sparring?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s lips pouted in slight confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, Me. Sparring. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>At first, Kirishima just blinked a few times. But then, his expression sagged, just a little. \u201cBakugou, you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki let out a huff. \u201cI need to train.\u201d</p>\n<p>Looking to the side guiltily, Kirishima chewed at his bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be taking things easy, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh sure, but \u2018taking it easy\u2019 and \u2018doing fuck-all\u2019 are not the same fucking thing, and you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose, maybe, I could go with you to a practice room, spot you while you do warm-ups or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not training, that\u2019s stretching. Come on, Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not to mention that, Katsuki had tried using a practice room yesterday, but apparently, his student ID\u2019s key swipe no longer had clearance to that area of campus. Go fucking figure.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Right. Well\u2026\u201d Kirishima shrugged a little, clearly thinking through some options. \u201cI do have a punching bag. I know it\u2019s not the same as actual hand-to-hand combat. But I think it could do you some good. Help you release whatever you\u2019ve got bottled up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but let out a <em>tch</em>. He didn\u2019t <em>bottle things up</em>. Hell, even if he did, some stupid punching bag wasn\u2019t gonna fix it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kirishima let out sharply at the disgruntled look on Katsuki\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s my punching bag. I didn\u2019t have to offer it to you. Do you want to use it or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki thought for a second, considering his options. Either train alone in his room, or beat up something. And, he had already trained alone in his room.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he grumbled, pushing Kirishima aside and stepping into the door. Without wasting any time, as soon as he reached the bag, he squared up, lifting his fist.</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, woah, woah, woah, hold up, stop.\u201d Kirishima hopped across the room to a drawer in his desk. He rummaged around in it before offering Katsuki two boxing gloves. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need these. Jeez,\u201d he muttered under his breath, \u201cyou\u2019re certainly\u2026 enthusiastic today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki just looked down at the gloves, upper lip lifted in repulsion.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just my spare. I haven\u2019t used them, they\u2019re clean.\u201d Kirishima shoved them toward him again, more forcefully this time. \u201cBoxing wraps. Gel ones, the good stuff. Please don\u2019t blast them too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>With another petulant huff, Katsuki snatched the gloves and pulled them on. He wrapped the Velcro around his wrists, giving each a few rolls to gauge their support.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Thank you,\u201d he mumbled, as if saying it low enough would make it feel less significant.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem, man!\u201d With a smile, Kirishima crawled back onto his bed, where a textbook and notes were sprawled about. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I\u2019ll just be working on that English vocab.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nodded in Kirishima\u2019s general direction before turning his attention once again to the punching bag.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t really get the point of punching bags. Sure, he knew the techniques, knew a jab from a hook, but he didn\u2019t see the appeal in beating up an object that couldn\u2019t fight back. Where was the challenge in that? It just didn\u2019t seem like training to him, and it certainly wasn\u2019t what he had been planning to do with his afternoon. But, as Katsuki gave the bag a few experimental jabs, then an undercut, then a short right hook, he realized that maybe Kirishima had a point. This would certainly be better than nothing.</p>\n<p>So with a satisfactory grunt, Katsuki began. Keeping his elbow loose and close to his body, left foot forward, right foot back, fists held high, he jabbed the bag for real this time. Then he let out a few hooks, wides and shorts, then a few body-shots.</p>\n<p>And he thought. He thought about his condition. He thought about his medicine, he thought about his parents and teachers, his training, how much he was being set back. How much he would rise above it all when this all boiled over. He imagined all of those souring thoughts to leave him, lifting weights off of his shoulders, burdening themselves on the bag instead with every hit.</p>\n<p>When he felt his frustration building up to dangerous levels, he let out a cross with his back arm, lifting his right heal to help him carry through the motion, the extra momentum making a much stronger impact. Powerful. When his anger became too much, he would switch it up, hop back and test out a few kicks. But he wasn\u2019t a fan of kicking as much lately, so he mostly stuck with the punches.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long for him to find a rhythm, a sequence that worked with the natural movements of his body. Jab, cross, hook, undercut. Over and over again. Eventually, he found himself bouncing from the ball of one foot to another, could feel his heart rate pick up, could feel his cheeks flush and his forehead acquire an even sheen of sweat, and everything started to recess to the background. And for just a moment, things were starting to melt away. In that one moment, he felt just a little bit free.</p>\n<p>Goddamn, this really was cathartic.</p>\n<p>But, it still wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t long before it all came crashing back to him, the like the ocean tide reclaiming his thoughts to the depths. No matter how hard he swam against the current, no matter how many punches he threw, his mind sank back to how trapped he was. How fucked up everything was. How it had all turned to shit. He needed more distraction, needed to train harder, he couldn\u2019t fall behind. Not again. It started consuming his mind, he had to do something else, something more.</p>\n<p>With a snarl, Katsuki hit the bag with an open palm, and the sound of an explosion filled the room, so sudden that even he jumped a bit in surprise. As the little smoke cleared away, Katsuki lowered his hands to his side, panting, letting the familiar, comforting burning scent to fill his lungs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou, uh\u2026 You okay?\u201d a voice piped up behind him.</p>\n<p>Damn, he had almost forgotten Kirishima was even there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cFelt good,\u201d he grunted out.</p>\n<p>Kirishima's voice turned hopeful. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki turned to face him, his lips upturned into a devilish grin. \u201cFuck yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>At first, Kirishima just looked at him, eyebrows raised, blinking. But then, he let out a smile, so wide it was nearly blinding.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad to have you back.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a second, Katsuki froze. Those words, they were the same ones Kirishima had said before the dodgeball match, when Katsuki was allowed to train again. But this time, he got the feeling that Kirishima wasn\u2019t talking about the training.</p>\n<p>Katsuki nodded, to himself more than anything, his own grin refusing to leave his face.</p>\n<p>Yeah. He was glad to be back, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a few days, the punching bag became a normal, and quite welcomed part of his schedule. Every day after the class\u2019 training, while Kirishima worked on homework, Katsuki would run a few drills. On Tuesday night, Kirishima even showed him a few exercises than an instructor had taught him a while back. They incorporated more footwork, more mobility, working with a wider range of muscle groups. More ways to spend his newly abundant energy reserves.</p>\n<p>Because it was like two sides to the same coin. Right along with his energy, came that anger. And not just rumbling under his skin, either. By now, it had grown into a beast, fierce and untamed. It was everywhere, trying to consume him. And so were all of his other emotions. At least with a punching bag, he had an outlet.</p>\n<p>But, hey. The flowers still hadn\u2019t returned. Katsuki wasn\u2019t so na\u00efve to think that he was cured completely, but even so, some small part of him still wanted to hold onto hope that maybe, it was all over. He needed to get back to training already. Real training.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki clicked his tongue impatiently. \u201cOf course I am, Shitty Hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Ehh, I\u2019m not really sure we should be doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019re the one who\u2019d been bugging me about this, for fucking <em>ages</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I have,\u201d Kirishima gave a smug little grin. \u201cAlright, in that case\u2026\u201d He rolled his shoulders, stretched the joints a bit. Katsuki did the same. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take things easy at first. Just to get you back into the swing of things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki sighed. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo quirks yet, though. No contact, either. Just\u2026\u201d The redhead let out an uneasy breath. Seems he was more nervous about this than he was willing to let on. \u201cJust go through the moves in slow motion, see if you get dizzy at all, yeah? Maybe then, we can move up to something more. But if I think you should take a break, I\u2019m calling \u2018break\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be fucking <em>babied</em>,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t feel like waiting outside the nurse\u2019s office for two hours again. Not to mention that your key swipe doesn\u2019t work on these practice rooms anymore, right? You need me to get in here, so...\u201d Kirishima shrugged. \u201cI could always just, take back my offer\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dammit, Kirishima had a point there. That asshole. Katsuki glared to the side, jaw clenched.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 you accept the terms?\u201d Kirishima chirped. \u201cTake it easy, slow-mo, no contact, no quirks, yeah? In the beginning, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, just get on with it already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima brought his hands together in a clap. \u201cAlrighty then. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He squared up with Katsuki, facing him head on, only a little less than a meter away. The stance he took was low, knees bent, a slight bounce to him as he shifted weight from one foot to the other. With a duck of his head, he brought his fists in front of his chest and face, like a boxer\u2019s pose. Immediately, Katsuki mirrored his position.</p>\n<p>Then, Kirishima brought a fist forward, aiming it at Katsuki\u2019s face. It was fast, sure, but not anywhere close to speed, and with a swerve of his head, Katsuki could easily dodge it. In response, he aimed a hook at Kirishima\u2019s jaw, just as slowly and without much force. Kirishima lifted an arm, his forearm blocking the hit.</p>\n<p>Their \u2018fight\u2019 was more like a call-and-response. Their movements were too slow to be helpful, each so painstaking that it looked as if they were performing some bizarre dance with Kirishima taking the lead. He\u2019d take a step forward, Katsuki would take a step back. One would attack, the other would defend, each taking their turns.</p>\n<p>There was no spark behind their jabs, no intent to injure or to even make contact. Each of Kirishima\u2019s hits stopped short of their targets, each implementation so predictable that Katsuki had no trouble dodging and retaliating in turn, and he had no choice but to match the nearly unbearable pace.</p>\n<p>But after an agonizing minute or so at this speed, Kirishima let out an upper-cut that was just a little more forceful than any of the throws before it. Katsuki immediately noticed, and leaped back to dodge accordingly. Seemed as though things were kicking up a notch, and Katsuki was eager to match the new pace.</p>\n<p>This pace had the hits coming faster, with more purpose behind them. The time between each attack lessened as well, so it was a lot easier to rely on instincts than think through every move. Just how Katsuki liked it. But, Kirishima was still holding back, tremendously. Even with the change, he still wasn\u2019t aiming to hit. Even as Katsuki blocked and dodged, he could see that each strike stopped just short. If Katsuki chose to stand perfectly still, refuse to get out of the way, Kirishima\u2019s jab would still probably not hit him.</p>\n<p>It was absolutely maddening, nearly insulting. This half-assed bullshit wasn\u2019t gonna cut it, he needed a full-on fight. He needed to actually train because he sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to let himself fall any more behind than he already was. He needed to feel his muscles strain and feel the sweat on his brow. He had anger, and frustration, roaring inside of him for the first time in days and he needed to let it out, fight it all out. He was ready for it.</p>\n<p>So with a bellow, Katsuki let his next punch make contact with Kirishima\u2019s shoulder. Not too hard, but enough to take the guy by surprise and cause him to stumble on his footing a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Kirishima grunted, hand instinctively reaching up to sooth the point of impact. After a quick roll of his shoulder, he turned back to Katsuki with a dangerous smile and a glint in his eye. The tension was nearly palpable. \u201cAlright then, if you\u2019re up for more...\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima stepped forward, and his next punch was <em>fast</em>, almost full-speed, a jab aimed straight at his face, and Katsuki was sure that if he hadn\u2019t leapt to the side, he would have gotten a bloody nose.</p>\n<p>That was more like it.</p>\n<p>In this new off-centered position, Katsuki\u2019s dominant arm was in the perfect position to strike Kirishima\u2019s midsection. So he let out a body-shot, aiming for the underside of Kirishima\u2019s ribcage. Kirishima pivoted to dodge, and the force of his own attempted punch caused Katsuki to lose balance and stagger forward. Suddenly, there was a sharp pain in his neck. He grunted, stumbling forward a few more steps, rubbing his nape. The bastard must have whacked him with his elbow, right where it hurt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cBreak,\u201d Kirishima puffed out through his deeper breathing. \u201cOhh man, I\u2019ve missed this. Also, that was really good for having not trained in so long, although I suppose I don\u2019t expect anything different from you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018break\u2019?\u201d Katsuki growled. He turned to Kirishima, eyebrows lowered, a smirk on his lips. \u201cNot when I\u2019m just getting warmed up! Don\u2019t underestimate me, bastard!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima paused for a second, looking Katsuki up and down, seemingly considering his options. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cWell, come on then. Show me what you\u2019re made of.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the way he raised an eyebrow, playfully, like it was some sort of a challenge\u2026 in an instant, the cinders in Katsuki ignited into a full-blown fire. It <em>was</em> a challenge, one that he was sure to face head-on with all his might.</p>\n<p>In a blink of an eye, Katsuki lunged toward him, trying to knock Kirishima off balance. Kirishima braced himself, widening his stance and holding his ground to withstand the attack. He even managed to aim a hit in the process, right at Katsuki\u2019s stomach as he approached, nearly at full strength, and as the fist made impact, pain blossomed in Katsuki\u2019s abdomen. He stumbled back. It hurt, but he\u2019d had a lot worse than that. He breathed deeply, composing himself, giving himself a second to recover before an attack that was sure to follow.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, this time Kirishima lunged at him, fist raised and ready to strike, his lack of subtlety giving Katsuki the chance to anticipate where it was aimed \u2013 his shoulder. He darted out of the way. With one hand, he grabbed the wrist of Kirishima\u2019s punch, and with the other hand he whacked the inside of Kirishima\u2019s elbow, forcing the arm to bend. Then, maintaining his strong hold on Kirishima, he pushed his entire body forward. In an instant, Kirishima pushed back, his arm folded up between them, their bodies so close that neither of them could attack with any significant momentum.</p>\n<p>Now they were in gridlock, tension building even higher, like two head butting deer locked at the antlers. Their heavy grunts filled the room as they struggled for some sort of dominance, trying to push the other away first. And Katsuki could feel the sweat beginning to bead on his brow, could feel the adrenaline coursing through his veins. Feelings that he had been missing, emotions that had been shrouded by static for so long were finally reaching the surface. It was exhilarating.</p>\n<p>But it still wasn\u2019t all there yet. He needed more, he needed to feel himself go all out, reach his full potential, like he hadn\u2019t been able to do for weeks. He needed to feel the power in his hands, needed to feel the fire in his veins ignite between his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cQuirks,\u201d he managed to rumble out through clenched teeth.</p>\n<p>Kirishima peered over to him, eyes wide. His hold slackened, just a bit as he panted, \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c<em>Quirks</em>,\u201d Katsuki grunted again. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare hold back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeh, if you say so...\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the skin underneath his fingertips became rigid, a tough armor, sharp and glossy like obsidian. Katsuki blasted into the quirked skin, the sparks offering the little push that he needed to get the upper hand. He pushed Kirishima away, aiming a blast towards his face.</p>\n<p>The room erupted in light and a loud <em>boom</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, you\u2019re gonna have to do more than that to get me!\u201d Kirishima croaked out a laugh as the smoke cleared around him. The top of his shirt was singed, and small puffs of smoke were rising from the tips of his hair, but otherwise, he looked fine. \u201cI\u2019ve improved since the sports festival, you know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Katsuki grinned back, dangerous. \u201cThen show me.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a bellow, Kirishima charged at him, letting out a tirade of throws, causing Katsuki to take the defensive as they took step after step, Kirishima pushing onwards and Katsuki having no choice but to fall back for the time being.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned control,\u201d Kirishima panted between hits. \u201cI\u2019ve learned efficiency.\u201d He threw another punch. \u201cHow to localize my quirk even more,\u201d <em>punch</em>, \u201cso it\u2019s only activated where I need it most.\u201d</p>\n<p>The attacks kept coming. At this rate, Katsuki was going to get backed into a wall. He needed a way out, and fast. For just a second, there was an opening at Kirishima\u2019s side, so he aimed a blast there.</p>\n<p>Even if it didn\u2019t do any damage, the force was enough to push Kirishima off of him, and Katsuki seized the opportunity to put some distance between them.</p>\n<p>Kirishima just leered at him from across the way, a mischievous glint in his eye. \u201cI told you, that won\u2019t work on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but what about when localization doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d Katsuki brought both of his hands out in front of him, palms facing forward. \u201cYa see, that\u2019s the good thing about explosions \u2013 they aren\u2019t very picky about their targets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Without warning, he fired his quirk, as big as he dared, loud and bright, hot waves exploding from his very fingertips, and <em>god</em> did it feel good. He let out a little laugh, not giving a single fuck about how absolutely bat-shit crazy it made him sound.</p>\n<p>But then there was the smoke, thicker than it had been from the smaller blasts, and slow to clear in such a small, unventilated space. Through the veil, he could hear Kirishima in front of him, coughing as he scrambled to his feet. Then, there was just an eerie stillness. Katsuki lowered hands, listening closely for any sign of movement.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, to his left were footsteps, stomps, running, and with a shout, Kirishima burst from the smoke and bulldozed\u00a0into Katsuki, tackling him down.</p>\n<p>The next thing Katsuki knew, the back of his head was slamming into the ground, and his arms couldn\u2019t move, his body couldn\u2019t move. When he creaked his eyes open, he saw Kirishima looming over him, straddling his torso, pinning down his wrists.</p>\n<p>The air was filled with their heavy panting, their chests expanding and contracting with each hot breath that mixed between them, the smell of their sweat as it beaded and trickled down their faces. Katsuki needed water, his mouth was dry. And, they were close. So close.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreak,\u201d Kirishima finally wheezed out.</p>\n<p>Katsuki couldn\u2019t find the will to object.</p>\n<p>With a sigh, Kirishima released Katsuki\u2019s wrists and brought his own forearm up to wipe the sweat away from his brow. His other hand grabbed the bottom hem of his shirt and waved it around, cooling off his chest. Meanwhile, Katsuki managed to prop himself up on his elbows, closing even more of a gap that was between them, head hung low, chin against his collarbone as he just let himself inhale, and exhale.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeh, see?\u201d Kirishima breathed, a grin lighting up his face. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten better. You okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d Katsuki trailed off, still struggling to catch his breath. The weight on his chest was really not helping \u2013 nor was the fact that, even with the fight finished, the tension between them hadn\u2019t yet dissipated. If anything, it was getting <em>stronger</em>. \u201cYeah,\u201d was the only affirmation he could manage to croak out.</p>\n<p>Kirishima looked down to him, his warm smile now radiating from ear to ear. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d His voice was airy. He leaned his head back as he took another deep breath, looking to the ceiling. \u201cHah! I won! Finally!\u201d</p>\n<p>He let out a weak little <em>whoohoo</em>, fist pumping the air in victory before promptly dropping to the ground beside him. He laughed as he brought his head back to look down at Katsuki. Tuffs of his ridiculous hair fell across his forehead, sticking to the sheen of sweat. The corners of his eyes were creased, from what must have been years of smiling and laughter, kindness, joy. His cheeks rosy and glistening, the small points of teeth showing between his lips, lips that were sure to still be upturned in a proud smile, pink, soft.</p>\n<p>With a flicker of his eyes, Katsuki stole a glance, for just a moment. Some part of him wanted to know what they would feel like against his own.</p>\n<p>And then, his eyes widened as realization slapped him in the face.</p>\n<p>Because, right now, he wanted to kiss. He wanted to be kissed. He wanted to feel that stupid red hair between his fingers, \u00a0he wanted to feel hot breaths against his lips, wanted to feel sharp teeth bumping into his. For the first time in his life he wanted all of that.</p>\n<p>They were close. So close.</p>\n<p>His eyes snapped up to meet Kirishima\u2019s gaze again.</p>\n<p>Kirishima was still looking down at him. His smile had lessened, his face taking on a curious expression, head tilting to the side, just a bit, eyes wide, like he was in some sort of a confused trance. He lowered his own gaze, eyes fluttered close.</p>\n<p>The air around them stilled, a beat speeding up in Katsuki\u2019s chest. And maybe it was just his imagination, but the distance between them felt like it was disappearing, slowly. And it would be so easy to lean forward, just a little bit, close the last remains of the gap between them, press their lips together.</p>\n<p>They were close. <em>So damn close</em>.</p>\n<p>His heartbeat grew, louder and louder, pounding in his ears, deafening.</p>\n<p>It would be so easy, and it was so fucking stupid.</p>\n<p>His breaths came out shorter and shorter, his lungs burning.</p>\n<p>Because there was <em>no fucking way </em>that Kirishima wanted it too.</p>\n<p>Then, there was a fragrance in his lungs and throat and nose, overpowering, unmistakable.</p>\n<p>Roses.</p>\n<p>The blood in Katsuki\u2019s veins turning to ice, his breath shuddering against Kirishima\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima blinked his eyes open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet <em>off</em>,\u201d Katsuki growled, pushing Kirishima off of him. There was too much pressure in his chest, his lungs and heart screaming out, this was bad, shit, <em>shit</em>. He scrambled to his feet. \u201cFucking, stay away from me,\u201d he snarled as he sprinted to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026 Bakugou, wait, I-I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The door slammed behind him, drowning out the shout. With a mad dash, Katsuki bolted down the hallways, skidding around corners until he found himself in the bathroom. Throwing a stall door open, he kneeled over the toilet, just in time for the coughing to begin.</p>\n<p>And, once the coughing began, it wouldn\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>And it was worse, so much worse than any time. It was as if the flowers had reawakened, and were determined to come back with an absolute vengeance. He hacked and gagged and hurled into the basin, his stomach lurching, lungs shuddering for breath, and it hurt like a motherfucker. It hurt so much, leaving his muscles tense and cramped and <em>weak</em>, limbs shaking, forehead clammy, eyes damp, his body screaming for oxygen.</p>\n<p>The only chance that he had at actually stopping the petals, and in one moment, one stupid, impulsive moment, he flushed it away.</p>\n<p>His hands grasped the seat of the toilet, knuckles white as more petals forced their way out, their scent more pungent and nauseating than ever. He kept gasping, hoping every heave would be the last. But as soon as it felt like they were relenting, they came back again, like a never-ending cycle, refusing to stop. Why wouldn\u2019t they stop?</p>\n<p>That medicine had been his only chance. His one chance, and he blew it.</p>\n<p>Tears stung at the corner of his eyes, only one thought on his mind, a myriad, over and over again: make it stop. Make it stop, make it stop, please, just <em>make it stop</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cUhhh\u2026 Bakugou?\u201d</p>\n<p>In an instant, Katsuki\u2019s head snapped around, panic-stricken, coming face to face with candy-cane hair and a pair of concerned multicolor eyes.</p>\n<p>The thing about hunching over all undignified, coughing up bullshit flower petals into a toilet in some bathroom stall, is that, generally, it\u2019s supposed to be a pretty <em>private</em> affair. It\u2019s draining. Confusing. Downright humiliating. Not something to show the world. And definitely <em>not </em>something to be interrupted.</p>\n<p>But apparently, Half-n-Half didn\u2019t get the fucking memo. That <em>bastard</em>.</p>\n<p>There he \u00a0stood, drenched in sweat from what must have been his own workout, just\u2026 staring. His expression was so devoid of emotion that it was downright freaky, eyes not hesitating to stare into Katsuki\u2019s like the guy was trying to <em>read</em> him. And for several moments, Katsuki could only stare back, frozen, wide-eyed, horrified. It felt like his stomach had\u00a0 just dropped away.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave,\u201d he finally managed to croak out.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s head tilted. He took a step forward. \u201cBakugou\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014<em>Leave.</em>\u201d Katsuki\u2019s voice erupted into a snarl, and for a moment, he tried to scramble to his feet, legs shaking, palms already beginning to smoke even as they pressed against the toilet seat for leverage. \u201cGet out, you bastard! I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But before any semblance of a threat could cross his lips, before his quirk could fully ignite, another wave of coughing overcame him. He sank back to his knees as he hacked, bringing fingers to his lips a moment too late, unable to stop the petals that fell out between them. They fluttered down his front, one by one, deep scarlet piling on the tile floor.</p>\n<p>Todoroki watched them fall curiously, eyebrows raised in surprise, and Katsuki wanted to scream. He wanted to yell, shout out curses at the world, but the roses wouldn\u2019t let him. They choked back his words, restraining him, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. With a snap of his head, he lurched back over the toilet as even more petals forced their way out.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s body continued to riot against the flowers with all of his strength, leaving his arms shaking, chest heaving, head swimming. It had never been this bad before. He had fucked up. His body just wanted to give out, give up. Along with the floral scent was a new taste tingeing the back of his tongue, sharp, metallic, blood.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Shit.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He had fucked up big time.</p>\n<p>His eyelids were screwed shut so tight that swirls of white were starting to dance behind them, and he was only vaguely aware of a figure \u2013 fucking <em>Todoroki</em>, he reminded himself bitterly \u2013 approaching him, lowering to his level, a hand patting awkwardly against his back, as if that was going to help a single fucking thing. And Katsuki wanted nothing more than to fight against it, wanted nothing more than to be left to deal with this in peace. But his body was trembling so much, making him weak, and he couldn\u2019t do a single fucking thing about it.</p>\n<p>With several quick gasps for air, the petals finally petered out. Katsuki watched as a string of saliva dripped from his mouth, red mixing with the clear, the strong taste of blood still lingering on his tongue. He inhaled as deeply as he dared, feigning black-out, before sitting back on his heels. But even that was too much effort, so finally, he collapsed to sitting, leaning his back against the stall wall, eyes shut as he just <em>breathed</em>, allowing the silence to settle around them.</p>\n<p>And then, Katsuki wanted to laugh. Because that nosy bastard was <em>still there</em>, kneeling right next to him, probably still watching him like some fucking creep. Would he be disgusted? Just plain confused? This was already shaping up to be one of the shittiest situations in his entire life, but at least he had one thing to look forward to. The look on Todoroki\u2019s usually vacant face was sure to be fucking <em>priceless</em>.</p>\n<p>But when Todoroki finally spoke, his voice was surprisingly composed. \u201cDo you have medicine?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounded much too close. Katsuki growled in warning. <em>Stay back</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d Todoroki tried again, a hint of irritation coloring his otherwise monotone voice. \u201cSurely you take medicine or something, where is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Honestly, of all the questions Katsuki had been expecting, that had definitely not been one of them. But, Todoroki was a guy of few words, relatively speaking. Maybe, through his disgust and confusion, he still managed to select the most essential ones.</p>\n<p>But when Katsuki opened his eyes, coming face-to-face with a kneeling Todoroki, the guy didn\u2019t look disgusted. He didn\u2019t look confused. His eyes weren\u2019t bugging out of his skull. There was no gaping fish mouth, or lip upturned in repulsion. He didn\u2019t even look entirely surprised. In his eyes was only worry. And it was so goddamn unsatisfying, what the fuck was up with this guy?</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any,\u201d Katsuki grunted, looking away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThrew \u2018em away.\u201d</p>\n<p>When at first no response came, Katsuki stole a glance in Todoroki\u2019s direction. Todoroki was just staring at him, again, like it was the only thing he was good for.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 What are you, an idiot?\u201d The guy finally mumbled, monotone, a sigh the only sign of what must have been exasperation.</p>\n<p>And that should have made Katsuki\u2019s blood absolutely boil. And it did, a little bit, but what he had done <em>was</em> really fucking stupid, and he knew it. So he only snorted, closing his eyes again as he leaned his head back against the stall.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t owe an explanation to anyone, much less to this nosy icy-hot bastard.</p>\n<p>His head was still swimming, pounding.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were fucking with my brain.\u201d Katsuki cleared his throat. \u201cThey made me dizzy, made me fall. So I flushed them. I wasn\u2019t gonna train on that shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s only going to make things worse, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, silence surrounded them again. Then, with a grunt, Todoroki began to move, and Katsuki realized he was standing. Was\u2026 was he actually leaving? The toilet flushed, taking the petals with it, but even over the rushing water, Katsuki could sense that Todoroki wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Todoroki finally spoke. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Recovery Girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki creaked his eyes open, focusing on the hand that was reaching down to him. As if he was going to take it or something.</p>\n<p>He swatted the hand away.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately, there was a strong, cold grip on his bicep, trying to pull him to his feet. \u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn, get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop fucking <em>manhandling</em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop manhandling you when you get up. I\u2019m not leaving you on the bathroom floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki scowled. It was humiliating, because dammit, Todoroki was strong. But, as much as he did <em>not</em> want to take Todoroki\u2019s hand, just a few minutes ago he had been coughing up<em> blood</em>. He had his pride, sure, but Katsuki wasn\u2019t stupid, and he needed to go to the nurse. Honestly, though, even with help, he wasn\u2019t sure he would be able to stand on his own without his legs collapsing underneath him. He was in no state to fight this, and he knew it. So, he gave in.</p>\n<p>As soon as he stopped resisting, Todoroki\u2019s grip slacked, just a bit. He tugged on Katsuki\u2019s arm, Katsuki using his other hand to push himself off of the tiles. By keeping his back against the stall, he could use it as extra support as he stood on his wobbly legs. His head was swimming, lungs burning from lack of oxygen, but he was on his feet.</p>\n<p>Todoroki slung Katsuki\u2019s arm around his shoulders, and the two of them slowly exited the stall. After leading them to the sinks, Todoroki turned on a faucet. He didn\u2019t say a word, but Katsuki understood. He cupped his free hand under the running water and brought it to his lips, swishing it around before spitting it out again. The water was stained light pink, bright against the porcelain. The metallic taste in his mouth had abated, just a bit. He took another palm-full and gulped it down, giving his throat some much-needed relief. With water dribbling down his chin and onto his shirt, Katsuki turned off the faucet, giving a slight nod. He was ready to go on.</p>\n<p>They walked out of the bathroom and down the hallway side by side. Todoroki was several centimeters taller than him, which made their position feel all the more awkward, and the hand pressing harshly into his waist to keep him upright was definitely <em>not </em>appreciated. It was a slow process, slower than it needed to be, but it seemed like Todoroki wasn\u2019t willing to take any chances. And frankly, neither was Katsuki. The last thing he wanted to do was faint.</p>\n<p>As they passed the training rooms, Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but steal a glance through their windows. Kirishima was already gone. That was probably for the best. Kirishima wouldn\u2019t have to see him like this.</p>\n<p>They continued out of the training facilities and onto the main quad, making their way towards the academic building that lay only a couple of yards away. Katsuki scanned the area swiftly, following a few far-away students as they roamed the campus. It was after classes, but not quite dinner yet, so there were few students outside \u2013 most importantly, none that he recognized. No one to witness him in this hopeless, pathetic state. They entered the academic building without incident.</p>\n<p>There was still no denying how embarrassing this all was, but as much as he hated relying on the guy like some sort of weakling, at least Todoroki stayed quiet. Todoroki didn\u2019t ask questions. The same could probably not be said for most of his other classmates. And for that, Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but feel just a tiny bit\u2026 thankful.</p>\n<p>By the time he and Todoroki reached the elevator, Katsuki had managed to push himself off of Todoroki\u2019s shoulders, settling for a strong grip around the guy\u2019s upper arm for support instead. Todoroki made no comment. The entire elevator ride was silent, uncomfortable \u2013 Katsuki, too busy sulking and trying to keep the rage that was bubbling inside of him in check, and Todoroki, too busy keeping to himself. Who knew what he was thinking about?</p>\n<p>After one final stretch of hallway, the two finally reached the nurse\u2019s office. Todoroki brought his knuckles to the door, rapping firmly against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Recovery Girl\u2019s voice called out. Todoroki slid the door open just as she began swiveling around in her chair. \u201cWhat can I help you with\u2026?\u201d She trailed off, eyes settling on Katsuki. \u201cOh dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHe was coughing up petals, and <em>blood</em>.\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice was urgent, but unwavering. Far more composed than he had any right to be in this situation.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl let out a long, resigned sigh. \u201cI feared something like this would happen. Did you forget to take your medicine this morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Katsuki even had a chance to open his mouth, Todoroki cut him off. \u201cSaid he threw them away.\u201d</p>\n<p>With eyebrows raised, Recovery Girl let out a tutting sound. \u201cSet him down on a cot. And, stick around. I may need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki nodded, maneuvering the two of them as best he could across the room and dropped Katsuki off on the edge of the mattress before taking his seat in the visitor\u2019s chair.</p>\n<p>After donning rubber gloves, Recovery Girl rolled her swivel chair over, inserting a stethoscope into her ears and motioning for Katsuki to turn around. He did as best as he could, sitting at an angle so his back was mostly to her. She reached under his shirt and the cold circle of the stethoscope against his back sent chills up and down his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe deeply.\u201d</p>\n<p>He did as she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d She moved the stethoscope a few inches to the right. \u201cAnd again\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Between his breaths, she repositioned the stethoscope several more times. Katsuki could feel how his breathing was shaky, strained. Shallow. No doubt she could tell. After a few more movements, she pulled his shirt down. Katsuki turned to face her again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you doing that set it off?\u201d</p>\n<p>No use lying. \u201cSparring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith who?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki shuddered. There was a memory, red hair, a bright face looming over him, imagination spiraling out of control, pressing lips against his, lips that had been so close before, and in an instant, Katsuki\u2019s breath caught in his throat. The squeezing in his chest returned, the sickening scent tickling the back of his throat. He nearly doubled over, coughing into his inner elbow. The petals came out, scarlet tainting scarlet, mouth filled with the flavor of roses and a tinge of blood.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl observed him closely. There was something knowing in her eyes. \u201cTodoroki, could you please pass Bakugou the box of tissues on my desk?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki obliged immediately. Katsuki glared as he approached, grabbing the box from his hands, watching Todoroki return to his seat before wiping up his petals.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be clear, blood is <em>not </em>a good sign,\u201d Recovery Girl explained. \u201cCould just be all that coughing rubbing your throat raw\u2026 or, it could be internal damage from the rose thorns. And after hearing your breathing, I think it\u2019s the latter. They\u2019ve gotten out of control.\u201d She hopped down from her seat and approached the cot. \u201cSit still, let me heal you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki did as he was told, sat still while she pecked his forehead. No matter how humiliating it was, he couldn\u2019t deny that she had an amazing quirk. He could actually feel some hidden stinging in his chest lighten up. Not long after, a wave of exhaustion overcame him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked away, nodding.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d She returned to her chair. \u201cNow, why did you throw out your medicine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was messing with my training.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hanahaki </em>is messing with your training,\u201d Recovery Girl corrected flatly. She rolled to her computer and began typing away at her keyboard, filling in what must have been some sort of a report. \u201cIs today the first time the petals returned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded. \u201cWhen was the last time you took anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout a week ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her typing came to an abrupt halt. After a beat, she turned slowly to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been off your medication for a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her words were slow. Deliberate. It didn\u2019t sound like a question, either, yet it seemed like she was waiting for an answer.</p>\n<p>So Katsuki just dropped his shoulders. Gave a little shrug. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl\u2019s lips pursed into a thin line. \u201cYou should never do something like that. Medicines are chemicals that affect your body, and to take that away\u2026 it can do some serious harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Katsuki looked at the floor, fists clenched in his lap. He knew it had been a fucking stupid move. He <em>knew </em>that, dammit.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl just let out another long sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m entirely surprised. Only surprised you didn\u2019t have to come and see me sooner.\u201d She finished typing a few last notes onto her computer before reaching out and taking her phone in her hand. \u201cI will call your parents, and your doctor, so they are aware of the situation. They\u2019ll be the ones to decide what to do about your treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever conversations she had to have, must have been conversations that she did not want Katsuki to hear, for in a matter of moments Recovery Girl had stood out of her chair and crossed the room, sliding the door open then shut behind her. Leaving Todoroki and Katsuki entirely alone.</p>\n<p>The silence that surrounded them became uncomfortable in a single instant. It crept under Katsuki\u2019s skin, made him seethe, made him want to fight or flee. He looked down at his hands in his lap, clenching his fists until his fingernails left little crescents indented into his palms.</p>\n<p>Looking for a distraction from it all, Katsuki slid into the cot, his back against the wall, looking at literally anything other than that half-n-half bastard. It was that guy\u2019s fault he was even here in the first place, a growling part of his brain insisted. But Katsuki knew that wasn\u2019t the truth. It was his own damn fault. Of course it was, he\u2019d have to be a fucking idiot to think otherwise. But that didn\u2019t mean he had to be happy about Todoroki being there either.</p>\n<p>They sat in this absolute quiet for what must have been several minutes, the faint sound of Recovery Girl\u2019s phone calls drifting into the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWhy the fuck are you even still here?\u201d He finally piped up. The aggravation was nearly palpable.</p>\n<p>For a while, there was no response. Out of the corner of his eye, Katsuki could only see Todoroki\u2019s still form, his steadfast gaze staring straight through him. Watching. Thinking. Why wasn\u2019t he answering? Why was he always so damn quiet? On one hand, it was a fucking blessing, it would have been worse if the guy was talkative. But in this moment, with all the questions that were no doubt racing around that guy\u2019s head, Katsuki would rather get it over with than sit in silent, hair-pulling anticipation.</p>\n<p>Finally, Todoroki shifted in his seat. Swallowed a lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kirishima, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s eyes widened. He lurched forward, bringing a hand to his mouth, and no matter how much he tried to push it down, it wasn\u2019t long before he was hacking the petals out of his lungs again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>, Todoroki?\u201d He wheezed out between coughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have brought him up.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least there wasn\u2019t blood this time. As the coughing fit finally passed, Katsuki rested his forehead against his palms and just let himself breathe for a few moments. When it felt like air had sufficiently returned to him, he ripped a few tissues from their box, cleaning what petals had fluttered about. With one well-aimed shot, the tissues landed in the waste basket by Recovery Girl\u2019s desk before resting against the metal headboard again.</p>\n<p>Okay, that time had <em>definitely</em> been Todoroki\u2019s fault. That fucker. Katsuki clenched his jaw, folding his arms across his chest, settling for looking out the window. As Katsuki watched the sun as it sank lower and lower in the sky with each minute that passed, silence surrounded them once more. And he thought.</p>\n<p>And the more Katsuki thought, the more questions he needed answers for. It began as a small itch of curiosity, but it blossomed into something unavoidable. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, allowing his raspy voice to carry around the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>At first, there was only the sound of Recovery Girl\u2019s muffled voice through the doorway. Maybe Todoroki was surprised that he had spoken at all. But then there was a shifting in a chair, followed by a clear voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two have been through a lot together. There\u2019s no one else it could be\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014<em>No</em>.\u201d \u00a0Katsuki turned to Todoroki, his stare steadfast, his eyes burning. \u201cHow do you <em>know</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>For a split second, Todoroki\u2019s eyes widened. It was quickly replaced by his typical expression, and he stared back, his face blank. But Katsuki had seen it, how caught off-guard he had been. \u00a0He noticed the way Todoroki had straightened in his chair, had swallowed a lump in his throat. The guy had given himself away \u2013 he was nervous.</p>\n<p>Their gazes did not waver for quite a while, like they were in some sort of a stand-off. Finally, Todoroki opened his mouth, as if to respond.</p>\n<p>Just then, the door slid open, and the tension released its hold on them. Todoroki broke eye contact, watching Recovery Girl as she made her way to her chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father will be on his way shortly, and until this is resolved, you\u2019ll be staying at home.\u201d She took a seat and turned to Todoroki. \u201cThank you for bringing him in, and for watching after him. I can take it from here. You may return to your dorm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki stood to his feet quickly \u2013 <em>too quickly</em> \u2013 giving her a curt nod before walking to the door. Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but stare after him, his mind a whirl of confusion and shock and the frustration of too many things left unanswered.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl sighed, watching as the door slid shut. \u201cYou are very lucky that it was Todoroki who found you.\u201d Her words were slow, deliberate. \u201cOtherwise, you would have had a lot more explaining to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 He knows what this is.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl rolled to her desk, forgoing a reply.</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked to her sharply, brows furrowed. \u201c<em>How</em>?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI thought it was supposed to be rare.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if blatantly ignoring him, Recovery Girl began typing again. And it was so frustrating, the feeling like he was being kept in the dark. He looked back down to his lap. He just wanted to understand.</p>\n<p>After a moment, the computer clicking paused, and Recovery Girl\u2019s voice cut heavily through the quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo people, in close proximity of each other, developing the same rare condition\u2026 it seems statistically unlikely. And it would be, if the condition developed randomly. But usually, there are factors that contribute to susceptibility. Meaning, certain populations are at greater risk of developing certain conditions. Hanahaki Disorder is no different. And, love is <i>not</i> the only causal factor.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way she said it, expression solemn, with an air of finality, made it seem like that was all she had to say on the matter. But there were still things Katsuki needed to know. Things he needed to be <em>certain</em> of.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d He tried again, struggling to keep the edge of desperation out of his voice. \u201cWhat are you trying to tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, UA\u2019s carelessness has put our students at greater risk.\u201d</p>\n<p>The following silence pounded against his eardrums, brain on overdrive, trying to digest this new information. He still didn\u2019t know what it all meant, but he had a sinking suspicion, one that made his stomach plummet, and a part of Katsuki felt like he was beginning to understand more about his icy-hot classmate than he had <em>ever</em> wanted to. But another part of him was left with more questions than answers, and the frustration of uncertainty just kept eating away at him.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl spoke again, dragging Katsuki out of his shell-shocked reverie.</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume that your condition is being triggered by one of your classmates?\u201d</p>\n<p>The way she paused, looking to him, it was as if she was waiting for affirmation. But Katsuki couldn\u2019t say it, couldn\u2019t nod. Affirmation would be admittance, and he couldn\u2019t admit it, not even to himself. Not yet. So he just stared straight ahead.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat complicates things, quite a bit,\u201d she continued, seeming to take his silence as confirmation anyways.</p>\n<p>Katsuki let out a sigh, letting his eyelids flutter closed. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you asking me about your treatment?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that will ultimately be for you and your parents to decide with your doctor. A more long-term option would be a surgical procedure to remove the flowers, but there have been so few patients that not much is known about its effects. In this way, it\u2019s risky and unpredictable. When I spoke with them on the phone, neither your doctor nor your parents were too keen on it \u2013 and frankly, neither am I.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what else is there?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but clench his jaw, his words pressing between his teeth. \u201cThere has to be something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have suggested a lower dosage of your previous medication. The side effects won\u2019t be as strong, but that means the medicine itself won\u2019t be as effective either. The petals would be subdued, but they may not go away entirely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m just, supposed to <em>live</em> with the petals?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat might be all you can do. The only other option would be removing you from the trigger.\u201d Recovery Girl leaned back in her chair. \u201cEven if you are put back on medication, it\u2019s quite likely that your doctor or UA faculty will decide that the best course of action moving forwards is to move you to Class 1B.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words engraved themselves into his mind, repeating, echoing, until they didn\u2019t even feel real anymore.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Class 1B.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki ducked his head, heart absolutely sinking. He scrunched his eyes shut, as if hoping that would make it all go away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father should be here within the hour. Until then, you best get some rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ride home was awfully quiet.</p>\n<p>His dad wasn\u2019t usually the type of guy who would let awkward silences last, he\u2019d rather ramble on about nothing just to hear his voice fill empty space. So it was really fucking freaky to not hear a single word from him, but oddly enough, he kept his mouth shut. It was a relief, really. There was too much thinking to do anyways.</p>\n<p>The scenery whizzed past them, but it faded into the background. There was only the vague sense of scenery becoming more and more familiar as they approached home.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Home.</em>\n</p>\n<p>In a way, home was a relief too. No Kirishima, who had no idea what he did to Katsuki. No Todoroki, who knew all too much. But, on the other hand, he was just falling more and more behind, wasn\u2019t he? He should be in class. Should be training. He wanted to be a hero, and he would never give up on that, but taking pit stops every week or two was only going to make things harder. How long would be be home? A day? A month?</p>\n<p>And what might await his return? The <em>other</em> hero course. That shouldn\u2019t have mattered, it really shouldn\u2019t have. Class 1B was just as much a part of the UA Hero Course as Class 1A. Wasn\u2019t like he knew all of his current classmates anyways. He just needed to change dorms, get his new schedule. It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.</p>\n<p>But, the way his stomach had dropped, the way the utter dejection had rendered him feeling hopeless\u2026 the way he wanted to yell and shout in objection, the way he was willing to do just about whatever it would take to stop that from happening\u2026</p>\n<p>It did matter. It mattered a <em>lot</em>.</p>\n<p>A small voice in his head wondered why. But, he knew why.</p>\n<p>Finally, they pulled into the driveway, and it started to sink in, just what was coming for him. The drive had just been the calm before a storm. What was sure to be a very large, very angry storm.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, as Katsuki toed off his shoes and stepped out of the <em>genkan</em>, the storm reared its head.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Katsuki</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother immediately looked up from where she was seated at the kitchen table. She stood to her feet quickly and rushed across the room to them. For a moment, her eyes were wide, almost lost. They searched Katsuki\u2019s face, as if making sure he was all there and that he was alright. Katsuki had only seen her look like that twice before, as if she just wanted to embrace him and all of that sappy shit. It wasn\u2019t like her.</p>\n<p>But then, her eyebrows drew together, her distress giving way to rage.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd just <em>what</em> sort of<em> bullshit </em>were you trying to pull?\u201d</p>\n<p>He kept his eyes low, his lips pulled back in a snarl as he pushed past her. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot until I have answers,\u201d she called after him, hot on his tail. \u201cI can\u2019t <em>believe </em>you would do something so irresponsible, something so reckless. It was <em>dangerous</em>, when we got the call from the nurse I was worried <em>sick</em>. What the fuck were you thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki tried blocking out her nagging, but she was so damn loud and his blood was boiling already. If he couldn\u2019t try blocking her out mentally, he just had to try something else. Some sort of a distraction. If it annoyed her, that was even better. So instead of locking himself in his room, Katsuki headed straight towards the living room, petulantly grabbing the remote and turning on the news before plopping down on the couch. His mother groaned from behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMitsuki,\u201d he heard dad\u2019s voice carry faintly over the newscasters, \u201cMaybe we should give him some space\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe needs to take some fucking responsibility first. An explanation, at the very least!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolled his eyes. Turned up the volume.</p>\n<p>That did nothing to stop his mother. She marched into the room, standing between him and the TV. \u201cWhy did you stop taking your medicine in the first place? Where is it now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the sewers,\u201d he gritted out from between his teeth, \u201cWhere garbage like that belongs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d his mom practically shrieked.</p>\n<p>Katsuki turned up the volume more, until he started to hear base frequencies rumble in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, no siree, we\u2019re talking about this right now. Turn that off.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stormed to the television and pressed the power button, turning to him, brows furrowed in both anger and confusion. He blinked up at her.</p>\n<p>After a moment, she placed a hand on her hip and sighed. \u201cKatsuki, why the fuck would you throw your medicine away? You know it\u2019s supposed to help you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking<em> obviously</em>.\u201d He leaned back in the couch, pouting, waiting for the cushions to swallow him right up. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, you <em>do</em> know, yet you stopped taking it anyways.\u201d She brought her fingers to her temple, rubbing whatever headache she must have had there. \u201cIs this\u2026 I don\u2019t know, one of those problem-with-authority things? Teenage rebellion? A way to disillusion yourself into thinking that you have control over the disorder? Something like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>He let out a huff, head shaking in disbelief. He hated when his mom tried to psychoanalyze him.</p>\n<p>With another groan, she waved her arms around in frustration, \u201cThen I just, don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d do something like that. There\u2019s gotta to be a reason, right? \u2026Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked desperately to the space behind Katsuki \u2013 where his dad must have been \u2013 as if asking for help. He heard his dad clear his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a smart kid, Katsuki.\u201d He slowly stepped into Katsuki\u2019s line of vision. \u201cI know you are, I tell you that all the time.\u201d His dad\u2019s voice was calm, but his body was rigid. Stressed. Completely out of his element. \u201cAnd, your mother\u2019s right. Doing something like that without a good reason just doesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d He sat down next to Katsuki on the couch, letting out a long, resigned sigh as he did. \u201cWe just want to understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki didn\u2019t acknowledge him. Either of them, not even while they were waiting for him to respond. He couldn\u2019t, not for some time. Not when there was finally some peace and quiet. He just stared straight ahead, jaw gritted, leg bouncing. It was better that way. He didn\u2019t have to look at the disappointment on their faces.</p>\n<p>Finally, he let in a slow breath. \u201cIt made me dizzy,\u201d he mumbled.</p>\n<p>His dad was the first to speak up. \u201cDizzy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nodded. \u201cSome inner ear thing. When I fell, that was the medicine\u2019s fault. They wouldn\u2019t let me train.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was more. Of course there was, but he didn\u2019t want to say it. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his dad nod, satisfied with the answer, and that was a relief.</p>\n<p>But his mom just brought her hand to her chin, deep in thought. She paced the floor, something she always had done to help her work through problems.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d she started slowly, and Katsuki let out a grunt, because <em>of course</em> that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. She was too damn good at reading him. \u201cIf the side-effects were bothering you that much, you still should have talked to Dr. Yamakawa. Stopping anything cold-turkey is dangerous, I <em>know</em> you know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Of course</em> I know that,\u201d Katsuki rolled his eyes, set his jaw. He wasn\u2019t just gonna take her talking to him like an idiot. He gathered up all of the frustration, all of the attitude, all of the sass that he could muster. \u201cWhat if I just didn\u2019t want to take the medicine?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom leaned on one hip, arms crossed. Her eyebrow arched. \u201cMhm? Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy, I wanted to piss you off specifically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice try, smartass.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a growl, he stood to his feet, facing her head on. \u201cI\u2019m a stupid, ungrateful brat who takes things for granted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept I know you aren\u2019t! There has <em>got</em> to be something else going on, something you aren\u2019t telling us, why else would you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t fucking know, maybe I just honest-to-fucking-God didn\u2019t want to take it! Fucking <em>sue me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why not? What\u2019s the point in that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>told you</em>, you old hag, I couldn\u2019t train on that shit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWell clearly, you can\u2019t train off that shit either, so what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Because<em> I couldn\u2019t feel anything anymore</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>In an instant, the tension between them shattered, leaving only silence. There the two stood, staring at each other, chests rising and falling with each inhale and exhale.</p>\n<p>His mother\u2019s rage dropped from her face. In its place was only confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t look at it. He screwed his eyes shut, his breaths becoming shaky.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t feel, at all,\u201d the broken words tumbled out of his mouth, just as uncontrollable as the petals, bearing it all, \u201cCouldn\u2019t feel, not for anything, not for <em>him</em>, I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>His body was trembling. He wouldn\u2019t say it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d His mom\u2019s voice was soft. Patient. She didn\u2019t usually sound like that. He heard her step towards him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d He shook his head, tears starting to sting at his waterline. He <em>couldn\u2019t</em> say it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0There was a gentle hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2026\u201d His jaw wobbled, broken voice hitching in his throat.</p>\n<p>He creaked his eyes open, lifted his head until he met hers.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t say it. Couldn't admit it. But he didn\u2019t have to. She\u00a0already knew.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\"... Mom...\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>And finally, his tears began falling.</p>\n<p>Arms wrapped around him, holding him close, but he couldn\u2019t feel them. There were whispers, soft words of comfort in his ears, but he couldn\u2019t hear them. There was a scent in his nose, a squeezing in his lungs, petals falling all around him, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. They didn\u2019t hurt. Not compared to the hopelessness he felt.</p>\n<p>Because, it <em>was</em> hopeless. He knew it was, he had known all along, since the very beginning. The doctor had made it very clear.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018A person who is susceptible to developing Hanahaki Disorder is someone who experiences a deep love that is unrequited.\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>Unrequited.</p>\n<p>And\u00a0why would Kirishima love someone like him?</p>\n<p>For a while, there was only the pain.</p>\n<p>It shook inside of him, just as irrepressible as the petals that fell from his lips. It was all so much, swallowing him up like a rising wave, all of the anger, and frustration, and fear, and even as it seemed like the wave was receding, every painful gasp for air served as a bitter reminder. There was no holding it back. So, he cried. And it didn\u2019t matter how vulnerable or ashamed it made him feel, because somehow, it felt <em>good</em>.</p>\n<p>The voices were far away, their soft \u2018<em>it\u2019s okay Katsuki, it\u2019s all okay</em>\u2019s repeated over and over again like a broke record, but there was still comfort in it. With his mother\u2019s swaying embrace, comforting fingers running through his hair, his dad\u2019s firm rub on his back, it all slowly began to ebb away. The tears, the emotions, even the petals themselves receded, as if they were all used up. As if gone with the tide. Inside of him, the floodwaters left behind a hollow shell, a new sort of numbness. Except this time, the numbness wasn\u2019t chemically synthesized. Katsuki was simply at his wit\u2019s end.</p>\n<p>His arms fell limp from around his mom\u2019s torso, eyelids heavy as he leaned into her form, lungs barely bothering to take in even shallow breaths. The exhaustion was overwhelming. There was still the seat of the couch underneath him, still arms wound around him, still the voices of comfort in his ears, but those were the only things tethering him to reality.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe never taught you, did we? How to feel your emotions.\u201d The new words caught his attention. It was his dad. \u201cHow to deal with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsui shook his head. He didn\u2019t like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Katsuki,\u201d his mom was speaking next, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have pushed you so hard, not when you were hurting like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t want their apologies, dammit. He just wanted this all to be over.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>We\u2019re</em> sorry,\u201d his dad patted his back, apologizing again, and Katsuki hated it. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know the medicine would affect your emotions so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em>how</em>,\u201d he finally croaked out, voice coarse from the coughing. With new strength, his fists clenched into the back of his mom\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was just the medicine working, Katsuki,\u201d his mom breathed. \u201cJust the medicine, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>bullshit</em>,\u201d he muttered into her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Katsuki, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki barely noticed when his father took a box of tissues from the side table, cleaning up the mess of petals that had fallen everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s total fucking <em>bullshit</em>,\u201d he muttered again, more to himself than anyone else, a dangerously pissed-off tone creeping into his voice. \u201cWhat sort of <em>fucked-up bullshit\u2014</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019ll uh, go get him some water,\u201d his dad piped up quickly, rising to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the <em>fuck </em>would they give me something like that?\u201d He finally pulled away, sinking into the couch with a huff.</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout love, the flowers can\u2019t grow, right?\u201d his mom offered. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like medicine is smart. It can\u2019t tell emotions apart, so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki closed his eyes, sighing. \u201cSo it just took everything away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was all starting to make sense. He leaned his head back, staring up at the ceiling. Studying it. Anything to keep himself from crashing back into reality at full speed.</p>\n<p>For a long while, they stayed silent like that. Even when his dad returned with a water bottle, Katsuki only drank from it silently, stewing in his thoughts while his parents waited on.</p>\n<p>But finally, he managed to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounded a lot more scared than he would have liked.</p>\n<p>His mom let out a thoughtful hum. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to work out next. You have a doctor\u2019s appointment tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck. I can\u2019t fall behind.\u201d He ran a hand down his face. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get UA to send a tutor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd training?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could look into ways to advance your curriculum when you return to school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Would it be enough? Would any of this be enough to make up for all that wasted time? There was so much he was missing out on, Katsuki couldn\u2019t stop the doubt that ate away at him. But, what other choice did he have?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have we been telling you, Katsuki?\u201d His dad placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cSince the very beginning?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get through this,\u201d his mom responded. When Katsuki looked into her eyes, they were warm. \u201cWe\u2019re here for you, no matter what. And we love you so, so much. You know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>The feelings in his head were growing too much again. Katsuki sighed, closing his eyes as if that would help seal them all away.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His doctor\u2019s appointment had been yesterday. After studying the x-rays and assessing Katsuki\u2019s condition, the doctor suggested much the same as Recovery Girl \u2013 a similar medicine with a lower dosage to help keep both the petals and the side effects under control. Katsuki had found no will within him, or reason to object. His parents had agreed, too, and the prescription was written and ordered. Now it was just a waiting game.</p>\n<p>In much the same way, Katsuki was waiting in his bed that very evening. UA had been more than happy to supply a student tutor so long as their home visit was accompanied by a faculty supervisor. It was just a matter of them driving over after their class\u2019 training was finished for the day. And Katsuki had been waiting, cooped up in his room, since that morning, and it had been boring as <em>fuck</em>. At this point, he didn\u2019t even care if the tutor was someone annoying, he just needed to have something to do.</p>\n<p>From outside his window, he heard car doors slam shut. Katsuki sat up on his bed, looking through the blinds at the sleek black car that was now parked on the street in front of his house. On the side facing him was Mr. Aizawa, still in his hero costume from that school day. Walking around the car, a glimpse of red. Then, of white.</p>\n<p>Katsuki growled under his breath. \u201cYou can\u2019t be fucking serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Honestly though, Katsuki should have expected it. It made sense, fucking half-n-half was among the top of the class, not to mention that he had seen the Hanahaki and seemed to somehow know what it was already. But that didn\u2019t make it any less irritating.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki!\u201d His mom\u2019s voice suddenly carried loud and clear from the ground floor. \u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cComing,\u201d he shouted back, slinking his legs over the side of the bed and rising, dragging his feet to his bedroom door.</p>\n<p>The doorbell rang, and right as Katsuki made it about halfway down the stairs, his mother opened the front door while his father stood by patiently, still in his cooking apron from preparing dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening! Welcome! Come on in, come on in,\u201d his mother waved the two guests inside cheerily.</p>\n<p>Katsuki watched over the banister as the door closed behind them. Aizawa thanked his mother and briefly introduced Todoroki before toeing out of his shoes. Meanwhile, Katsuki had to suppress a snort as Todoroki stared wide-eyed at Mom for just a moment, something like alarm on his features. Katsuki knew that face. He knew it well. It was the \u2018holy-shit-the-resemblance-is-uncanny\u2019 face.</p>\n<p>But Dad ruined the moment by asking if he could hang Todoroki\u2019s uniform jacket. Todoroki obliged, placing his backpack on the floor as he shrugged it off. As he stepped out of the <em>genkan </em>and glanced around curiously, his eyes fell onto Katsuki. He gave a curt nod.</p>\n<p>Katsuki let out a <em>tch </em>and turned his head away, leaning against the stairwell wall behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you so much, both of you, for taking your time to do this.\u201d Even though his mother casually expressed her gratitude, she still somehow always managed to sound sincere.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t express our gratitude enough. Although, perhaps dinner might help,\u201d his dad piped up, motioning for Aizawa to follow him into their kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019ll be ready in a few. We can prepare some tea as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cTodoroki, just follow Katsuki up to his room,\u201d his mom smiled sweetly at the guest. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the two of you your dinner.\u201d Her voice became louder and snappier as she turned towards the stairwell. \u201cYou hear that, Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah yeah, I heard ya,\u201d Katsuki rolled his eyes, kicking his foot impatiently against the wall before pushing himself back to standing. \u201cOi, icy-hot. Hurry up.\u201d Without even waiting for Todoroki, he slowly began stomping up the stairs.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t long before he heard rushed steps behind him. In even less time, their footsteps fell in pace with each other. They made it all the way to the landing in silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cShe looks just like you,\u201d Todoroki finally spoke.</p>\n<p>This time, Katsuki did snort. He turned to his room, at the end of the hallway. As he made sure that Todoroki was following him from the corner of his eye, Katsuki watched Todoroki glance around at the picture-adorned walls that surrounded them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were a cute kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, can you be <em>not</em> creepy for once? Christ.\u201d Katsuki shoved his hands into his sweatpants pockets. \u201cSmalltalk doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even still, he couldn\u2019t stop his attention from drifting to the frames. Grandparents, aunt, uncle, the occasional cousin. The professional pictures he and his parents had gotten done the previous spring. Before that, his parents\u2019 15<sup>th</sup> anniversary. And even earlier, from elementary school, some candids from Tokyo Disneyland.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy old man\u2019s a sentimental bastard,\u201d he found himself explaining. \u201cWon\u2019t take the stupid pictures down.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, in that moment, Katsuki thought about the conversation he had overheard between Todoroki and Deku during the sports festival. The one about his home life. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder just how foreign all of this was to Todoroki.</p>\n<p>He reached to open the door. \u201cWhat the fuck do you even get out of this, anyways?\u201d he called out.</p>\n<p>Todoroki looked to him. Shrugged. \u201cNothing. But, I have to do my homework anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki sighed. Fair enough.</p>\n<p>They stepped across the threshold into his bedroom, and while he\u2019d be the last to admit it, Katsuki couldn\u2019t stop the anxiety that was beginning to dig a pit in his stomach. Their tutoring session was supposed to last about two hours. Two hours alone with the bastard who knew <em>wa</em>y more about his life than was comfortable. The pressure, the curiosity, the questions that were no doubt plaguing Todoroki\u2019s mind settled in the room like a goddamn elephant.</p>\n<p>And suddenly, Katsuki\u2019s own curiosity and questions for Todoroki, ones that had been nagging him for fucking <em>days</em>, didn\u2019t matter anymore. The last thing he wanted was to accidentally prompt his own interrogation.</p>\n<p>The two of them settled down on the floor, leaning against the bed, placing textbooks and paper on the short table in front of them. Todoroki told him to open his Algebra book, and without further ado, they set to work.</p>\n<p>Only about 15 minutes later, his mother brought them their food. But rather than put aside their schoolwork to eat and converse, the two trudged steadily along, first through algebra which had been easy enough, just adding on to what the class had learned the previous week. When Katsuki\u2019s dad came to collect their licked-clean plates, they started on their English, whose prepositions were just as fucking stupid as they always were, but the worksheet was standard enough. Then, as the first hour passed, they moved on to chemistry. With each subject, Todoroki would explain the basic principles before they would split off to work on the assignments, mostly alone, and in absolute silence.</p>\n<p>That icy-hot bastard was certainly quiet. When they were working independently, he only spoke when he had to, which in of itself was a rarity. The guy was one of the top in the class\u2019 academics, after all -- the two of them matched pace easily without much consultation.</p>\n<p>It grated on Katsuki\u2019s nerves. Something was missing, some sort of banter between the two of them, some camaraderie. Where were those stupid fucking jokes that he always heard? The frustrated huffs that Kirishima would make when he couldn\u2019t figure something out? The mumbling under Kirishima\u2019s breath when he was trying to think through a word problem, the way Kirishima would cheer when he got something right, Kirishima, Kirishima, <em>Kirishima\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Then there was the squeezing in his chest, the tickling, the goddamn <em>smell</em>, and he was too far gone to hold the roses back any longer. He scrounged his eyes shut, hunching over, coughing into the crook of his elbow.</p>\n<p><em>Goddamnit</em>.</p>\n<p>There was no way to know how many fell, for as soon as they were over, the corner of something poked into his shoulder. Katsuki turned sharply, only to see Todoroki fucking <em>shoving</em> a tissue box at him. With a <em>tch</em>, Katsuki took it and began cleaning himself up, tossing the waste in his basket.</p>\n<p>And then, after that whole ordeal\u2026 they went right back to work. As if nothing had happened. There were no questions or comments or anything. Just a few lingering concerned glances in his direction. Just enough to let Katsuki know <em>exactly</em> what Todoroki was thinking about.</p>\n<p>Seemed as though the fucking elephant in the room was the last thing Todoroki wanted to make small talk about, too. Katsuki couldn\u2019t decide if the silence made him feel relieved, or more on edge than ever, but the more that time passed uncomfortably between them \u2013 the more that Katsuki\u2019s own questions felt like they were going to eat him alive \u2013 the more it felt like the later. Frankly, it was just really fucking uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Finally, as Todoroki was finishing relaying to him their classic Japanese reading assignments when his mother\u2019s voice carried up the stairs, just as loud and brash as always.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey you two! Start wrapping it up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne moment!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki slammed his textbook closed, jumping to his feet to cross the room in two steps. Todoroki wasn\u2019t far behind.</p>\n<p>But Katsuki paused, hand frozen on the doorknob. At this point, he wasn\u2019t sure how many days this tutoring thing would last. He had told himself that he wasn\u2019t going to talk about\u2026 about <em>that</em>, and, he wasn\u2019t planning to, at least not really. But, the anxiety, it was growing and it wouldn\u2019t stop. He had to know one thing, for his own sanity, before the opportunity was gone.</p>\n<p>Eyes fixed ahead of him, he took a breath. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a brief moment without response. Then, there was a very assured \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki turned his head, letting his voice carry over his shoulder. \u201cAnd you <em>won\u2019t </em>tell anyone, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p>\n<p>And when Katsuki stole a glance, the look in Todoroki\u2019s eyes\u2026 it was understanding. And in that moment, what he felt towards Todoroki\u2026 it wasn\u2019t trust, exactly, but something similar. Solidarity, perhaps.</p>\n<p>Katsuki gave a curt nod. He swung the door open and led Todoroki back down the stairs, back out the front door, back to a freedom that was so far out of his own reach.</p>\n<p>And that was that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mother placed a glass of water on the kitchen table in front of him. Next to it, a small white capsule.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,<em> please</em> actually take these.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki stared down at the pill. When they had gone to pick up the prescription from the doctor\u2019s earlier that day, they were told it was a lower dosage, but he was skeptical. It didn\u2019t look any different. Same size and everything. Probably just less concentrated though.</p>\n<p>Still, Katsuki couldn\u2019t help the way his upper lip curled into what could have only been a snarl. He looked up to his parents. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bottle?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were told to hang onto it, and supervise you taking it every morning. At least for now.\u201d His dad uncrossed his arms and pushed himself away from the counter. \u201cYou understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki pursed his lips. He wasn\u2019t a fucking baby, but between being carried to the nurse\u2019s office three days ago, being on home rest, needing to be tutored, and now this medical supervision, he was certainly starting to feel like one. And it was <em>not</em> appreciated. Anger was bubbling up inside of him, and he wanted nothing more than to punch something.</p>\n<p>In a split second, his thoughts drifted, and through some convoluted game of word association, his brain went from<em> punching</em> to <em>punching bag</em> to <em>Kirishima\u2019s punching bag</em> to <em>Kirishima</em>, red hair, sharp teeth, soft lips that, for a moment, he had totally wanted to kiss.</p>\n<p>His eyes bulged as something in his chest tightened painfully.</p>\n<p>Katsuki popped the pill into his mouth, chasing it with water before slamming the cup back onto the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With dinner hot in his stomach, Katsuki was able to let himself focus on this second tutoring session once more. His pencil scratched against the paper as he worked on the draft of a short essay for Hero History. It almost felt like he was able to work through the paper on autopilot, his mind easily able to wander a little as he wrote.</p>\n<p>He had been taking the medication for one day now, and\u2026 he didn\u2019t feel much different. But it had taken a while for the first prescription to set in, too, so it was probably another waiting game. And, while his curiosity about Todoroki\u2019s situation still prodded at him, the more they studied together, the more he was able to suppress it all. It wasn\u2019t his business. Part of him didn\u2019t even want to know the truth anyways.</p>\n<p>Still deep in thought, Katsuki pressed the pencil eraser to dispense more lead. Nothing happened. He clicked the eraser furiously. Still nothing.</p>\n<p>All out.</p>\n<p>He let out a curse under his breath before turning to the redhead that was next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Kirishima, do you have any extra lead, my fucking pencil just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked over to where Kirishima sat, and he froze. Because, it wasn\u2019t Kirishima. Of course it wasn\u2019t, it was Todoroki\u2019s red left side, and now Todoroki was blinking at him like he\u2019d just spoke fluent fucking <em>Greek </em>or something.</p>\n<p>Blush must have been coloring his cheeks because they felt much too warm. On its own, his hand flew up to press against his chest at what must have been the flowers squirming uncomfortably inside of it. Then, right on cue, came the coughing.</p>\n<p>As he coughed, Todoroki handed him tissues. Which, in their two tutoring sessions, had become pretty routine. Katsuki couldn\u2019t even be bothered to feel that embarrassed about it when it happened anymore. And, as much as he would deny the notion that he was starting to trust Todoroki\u2026 perhaps there was some truth in it.</p>\n<p>When the episode passed and Katsuki had managed to gather his breath, he collected the spent tissues that were scattered around him and set his notebook aside, standing to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, where are you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThirsty,\u201d he croaked out, throwing the wad of tissues into the waste basket before nearly stumbling to the hallway.</p>\n<p>He began making his way down the stairs when voices floated up to meet him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c\u2014Yes, but from your position as homeroom teacher\u2026 do you truly find it necessary?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was his mom. Katsuki froze in the stairwell. The last time his curiosity had gotten the better on him like this, he\u2019d sorely regretted it. But, he just couldn\u2019t help himself. For some reason, it hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind that his parents and Mr. Aizawa would have things to talk about while he and Todoroki tutored. And Katsuki wanted to know what those things were.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know enough about the condition,\u201d Aizawa began to reply. \u201cIn the past, we have had students with Hanahaki receive treatment without transferring classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a brief moment, Katsuki wondered if Todoroki was among those students.</p>\n<p>Aizawa continued. \u201cBut \u2013 as Principle Nezu informed you when your son was first diagnosed \u2013 UA\u2019s involvement in this sort of treatment is solely on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 When I last spoke with Recovery Girl, she expressed concern over the severity of his condition, as well as his propensity to jeopardize his own treatment plan. She seemed to be under the impression that these measures are the most rational decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and our doctor agreed.\u201d Dad\u2019s voice was much more serious than Katsuki was used to hearing. \u201cWe understand that this might be the best solution, and I have no doubt that Mr. Vlad will hold Katsuki to the same standard that you do, Mr. Aizawa.\u201d</p>\n<p>So they <em>were</em> talking about moving him to Class 1B. He pursed his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, I feel the same.\u201d His mother added. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about how <em>he </em>will take it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>How <em>he </em>would take it? Try: <em>not fucking well</em>. Katsuki growled, stomping down the stairs, making his presence known. Immediately, the conversation stopped.</p>\n<p>He marched into the kitchen, where his parents and Mr. Aizawa were sipping tea. Even as he passed them to grab a glass from the drying rack, he could feel their eyes follow him. He poured the water from the tap and took a few gulps before refilling the glass again. With a glare in his parent\u2019s direction, he began stomping his way toward the stairs again.</p>\n<p>As he walked up, Aizawa\u2019s voice carried to him again, much quieter this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is still time to consider all of the options. But it is important to remember that his health is priority. The last thing we want to do is make his condition worse\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s steps paused again, for just a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026 So, UA would like to know your decision as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>He ducked his head. He\u2019d be <em>damned</em> if his parents thought they were making that decision without him. He finished his way up the stairs and to his room, taking his seat next to Todoroki again. And, he thought.</p>\n<p>There was comfort in secrets. In people minding their own goddamn business. And, between him and Todoroki\u2026 It was as if, through sheer lack of willingness to have a conversation with each other, they had unwittingly reached some sort of mutual understanding. An agreement of silence.</p>\n<p>But at this rate, Katsuki was transferring to Class 1B. And as each urgent minute passed, the itch, the <em>need </em>to know how his classmate <em>knew</em>, about <em>everything\u2026</em></p>\n<p>There was still the question of how they both could have it. Statistically it didn't make sense, but if Todoroki<em> did</em> have Hanahaki, and if he had managed to get his symptoms under control, then Katsuki needed to know <em>how</em>. As soon as possible. And if that meant freeing himself from their unspoken agreement, breaking the silence, then that\u2019s just what he had to do.</p>\n<p>He picked up his notebook again, pencil scratching furiously against the paper.</p>\n<p>He cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. What do you take?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todorok\u2019s writing stopped. \u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki kept his eyes on his paper. \u201cWhatever the fuck you\u2019re taking must be working,\u201d he mumbled passively, \u201cand really fucking well.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a split second, Todoroki said nothing, and Katsuki could just imagine how the guy was staring. It would be a blank, stoic stare, maybe a few confused blinks like he always did when something took him aback.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was slow. Oblivious. There was <em>no way</em> that naivety was genuine. Katsuki had seen the fear in Todoroki\u2019s eyes in Recovery Girl\u2019s room. They had shared fucking <em>looks of solidarity</em>, so whatever innocent fa\u00e7ade that bastard was trying to pull had to be feigned. Right?</p>\n<p>There was no way Katsuki was wrong about this.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, don\u2019t fucking play dumb with me,\u201d he half-snapped. \u201cYou have it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s pencil stopped.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t make sense. Katsuki could feel his confusion amplify. He could feel his ears burning, too, from embarrassment. He gritted his jaw, pushing the curiosity deep down inside of him. No reason to ask more questions, he\u2019d made a goddamn fool of himself already.</p>\n<p>He had been so sure, too.</p>\n<p>Before the silence could stretch on too long, he set back to work again, pencil scribbling away. Maybe that way, they could pretend like this little miscommunication hadn\u2019t happened. Todoroki took even longer than Katsuki to return to his schoolwork. For a long while, they didn\u2019t speak. Only worked side-by-side, allowing the silence to come between them.</p>\n<p>There was a sharp voice from the stairwell \u2013 <em>\u201cBoys, it\u2019s time for them to head out!\u201d</em> \u2013 and Todoroki hopped to his feet, gathering his things before Katsuki could even set his pencil down. As the icy-hot bastard was busy hunched over, filing his supplies neatly into his backpack, Todoroki halted for just a second. It was difficult to ignore, the way his eyes wandered over in Katsuki\u2019s general direction, and Katsuki watched a <em>look </em>crossed his face, contemplative, before being replaced by his typical sheltered expression once more.</p>\n<p>And it was infuriating. If that bastard had something to say, he might as well come out and <em>say it,</em> for fuck\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2026\u201d Todoroki sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t have it now,\u201d he spoke, finally, keeping his eyes locked on the ground. \u201cBut. I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>With those words sprang a sinking feeling deep in Katsuki\u2019s gut. This was wrong, it was too much. All of a sudden, he was privy to knowledge that he shouldn\u2019t know, and Katsuki didn\u2019t know what to do with it, his brain short-circuiting, eyes bugging wide.</p>\n<p>A shaky breath passed between his lips, shattering the silence. \u201cYou\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki turned away, just a fraction. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a grunt, he hoisted his backpack over his shoulder, and faced the bedroom door. He stepped forward, once, then twice, hand reaching towards the doorknob. The guy couldn\u2019t just walk away like that. He needed answers, <em>dammit</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Katsuki called after him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI had surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, Todoroki opened the door, leaving Katsuki gawking after him, too stunned to say more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 and all I\u2019m saying is, it was a little rude of you to not see Mr. Aizawa and Todoroki out this evening,\u201d his mom\u2019s nagging voice called out from the couch.</p>\n<p>Katsuki only grunted, sinking lower into his chair. It had only been an hour or two since they had departed, and even still his brain was such a whirl that her words entered in one ear and flew straight out the other. That evening\u2019s news served as some well-needed white noise.</p>\n<p>He had been right. God fucking dammit, he\u2019d been right, but, he still had so many questions that needed answers, and the cacophony in his head was growing so loud that, for a moment, Katsuki regretted knowing anything at all because it wouldn\u2019t <em>stop</em> and he was getting overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>But now, he had a new goal ahead of him. Something to focus on. He couldn\u2019t get ahead of himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Maybe his dad was disturbed by his silence, for he spoke up. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Little numb.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u2026 reasonable level of numbness?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged. It wasn\u2019t that bad this time around, at least not yet. But it made it difficult to focus on things. And, he really needed his wits about him for this, because God knows how they were going to react.</p>\n<p>He kept his gaze strained on the television, elbow on the chair\u2019s armrest, lightly gnawing on the tip of his pinky between his teeth. \u201cI want the surgery,\u201d he dropped casually.</p>\n<p>In his periphery, Katsuki could see his parents exchange a<em> look</em>. Already, Katsuki knew he didn\u2019t like where this was going.</p>\n<p>Dad was the first to speak, shifting uncomfortably where he sat. \u201cWhy do you want the surgery?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s permanent, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s debated,\u201d his mom butted in. \u201cSo few people have gotten the surgery, there\u2019s not really a way to know how permanent or effective it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt gets rid of the flowers or something though, right?\u201d Katsuki could feel the rumble of frustration deep in his gut. \u201cI<em> have </em>to get back to training.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t know how your body would react\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014But it <em>might work</em>,\u201d he hissed through gritted teeth, \u201cyeah? Seems pretty fucking worth it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>His resolve needed to stay unwavering, so his parents knew how dead-ass he was about all of this. Because, he really was serious. This flowery bullshit needed to fucking <em>stop</em>.</p>\n<p>But, there were a few seconds where his parents said nothing, and as far as he was concerned the ball was in their court, so he said nothing too.</p>\n<p>When his dad spoke, his voice cut through the quiet. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want you risking it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Well good thing that\u2019s <em>my</em> <em>fucking decision </em>to make,\u201d Katsuki growled.</p>\n<p>His mom let out a short laugh. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not how that works, kid. We\u2019re your <em>parents</em>, and unlike you, we actually listen to the doctor when the shit he\u2019s saying is important.\u201d</p>\n<p>The anger inside of him was bubbling up, uncontrollably, fists squeezing so hard he was trembling all over. And the fact that he could feel so much while on the medicine really showed how different it was this time, but that didn\u2019t make it any fucking better. His folks were looking down on him, and it was so infuriating because, dammit, his mom had a point. He <em>hadn\u2019t </em>listened, that\u2019s why his fucking Hanahaki had returned in the first place. And he had a feeling that, that the more vehemently he protested, the less they would listen.</p>\n<p>So he grit his jaw and stayed quiet, hoping he could collect himself before another one of their rebuttals came his way.</p>\n<p>Just as he expected, his mother took his silence as an invitation to continue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t allow it. Do you even know what the surgery looks like?\u201d</p>\n<p>And the answer to that was plain and simple \u2013 no, Katsuki didn\u2019t know what it looked like. He hadn\u2019t listened, didn\u2019t bother to look it up, or ask questions. He looked down, a pout on his lips. Some part of him, deep down, felt embarrassment.</p>\n<p>Finally, he let out a half-assed shrug, giving the only answer that mattered to him: \u201cRemoves the roses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeahhh, it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that, and if you had listened to Doctor Yamakawa, you would know that. So, unless you do your research and find a way to convince <em>us</em>, you\u2019ll be changing classes. We\u2019ve already talked about it with UA. It\u2019s being finalized now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinked, trying to stop the slight sting in his eye. Even the air in his exhale was shaky, his jaw wobbling against his will, and the frustration felt like it was growing because he <em>still</em> couldn\u2019t counter any of what she said. He knew she had a point, <em>he knew that, dammit</em>.</p>\n<p>But, if he and Kirishima weren\u2019t classmates anymore, who knew how that would change their relationship? That unknown\u2026 it was terrifying. There were so many questions that needed answers, answers that only Todoroki could provide. And, just this once, Katsuki didn\u2019t care if it prompted Todoroki to ask questions of his own. He didn\u2019t care about the vulnerability. <em>Didn\u2019t fucking </em>care if it left his heart more open than he ever wanted it to be. He couldn\u2019t afford to care anymore, not when his decisions were being made for him. Not when he was right on the cusp of losing the closeness he shared with Kirishima. Not when every other option left him feeling even emptier than the one before it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been a week since Todoroki had found Katsuki coughing up in the bathroom. A week since having to be carried to Recovery Girl. A week since he had gone home. And once again, awkwardness had settled thickly between him and Todoroki as they sat down for their third tutoring session.</p>\n<p>Even though not much had been said between the two of them, about <em>that</em>, everything still seemed a little clearer. But with the new knowledge that Katsuki wasn\u2019t alone, that he could find something to relate to in this half-n-half bastard of all people, was\u2026 not <em>comforting</em>, per se, but whatever the feeling was, certainly wasn\u2019t far from that.</p>\n<p>But, with that new knowledge, and with Katsuki\u2019s mission in the forefront of his mind, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from watching Todoroki, out of the corner of his eye. And every time, he couldn\u2019t help but think about what he knew. About what he wanted to know.</p>\n<p>That had been going on for about an hour and a half, and they had just started attempting to work on their Hero History essays when Todoroki\u2019s pencil suddenly froze. Katsuki could see how Todoroki\u2019s eyes were peering from their corners at him.</p>\n<p>The guy closed his book and sighed. \u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna ask questions, just get it over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki averted his gaze. Seemed as though he had been caught staring. \u00a0\u201cI just want to know more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore about what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t play fucking dumb with me now,\u201d he let out a groan. \u201cYou said you had it, past tense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you. I had it, and then I got the surgery. What more is there to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe, when?\u201d Katsuki clicked his pencil for more lead. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re very old.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki shrugged. \u201cA couple months ago. I didn\u2019t have it for long, because, well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Right. \u201cThe surgery,\u201d Katsuki finished for him.</p>\n<p>The guy nodded. He looked down. There was something on his face, something akin to <em>misery</em>, but he covered it quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did it start?\u201d Katsuki tried again. He still needed to know more about how this whole situation worked out, after all. And, knowing what he knew about Todoroki, the guy had a tendency to overshare when put in a position to.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, it was like Todoroki couldn\u2019t resist. Maybe he just wanted to be understood.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was toward the end of the internships,\u201d he began. \u201cFirst time it happened, I was out patrolling with my <em>dear old dad</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, the bitterness in his voice threw Katsuki for a loop. Usually, the guy was so fucking guarded, so to hear his words dripping with hatred like that just felt wrong. But when he thought back to the conversation he had overheard during the sports festival\u2026 Hell, Katsuki couldn\u2019t blame the guy for his old resentments. Endeavor was a piece of shit.</p>\n<p>But\u2026 there was something else there now. This was not old resentment. The wound that the hatred was dripping from was fresh. And it certainly did nothing to satiate Katsuki\u2019s curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d He asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently, the condition isn\u2019t uncommon among heroes, so Dad knew what it was. He had me rushed off to a hospital for immediate surgery. It\u2019s not like I got affected for very long, but\u2026 that gross feeling, coughing stuff up like a hairball. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki let out a long groan. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking remind me. See, that\u2019s what I want to do, surgery. Because all of this is complete <em>bullshit</em> and I\u2019ve been dealing with it for fucking <em>weeks</em>. Can you imagine? There\u2019s no end to it. Now, if I could just, <em>not</em> have to worry about coughing up fucking roses every day of my life, that would be fucking great. Wouldn\u2019t have to miss classes, I could still train just like you do. But my shitty parents won\u2019t even listen to me when I bring it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s words were clipped, stern; \u201cyou don\u2019t want the surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taken aback, Katsuki looked up to him. \u201cAnd why the hell not? Seems to be working fucking great for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not some grand fix to the problem, okay? Don\u2019t treat it like that\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki set down his pencil and crossed his arms. \u201cWell. You can go to class and train and all the shit that I can\u2019t do anymore, so <em>excuse me</em> if I find that really fucking appealing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you,\u201d his voice rose, \u201cif you knew what you were talking about at all, then you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>When their eyes met, the look in Todoroki\u2019s gaze was intense, colored with what could only be described as\u2026 grief. It drew Katsuki in against his will, making him watch as Todoroki continued with his piercing gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt requires open heart and lung surgery,\u201d he enunciated every single syllable. \u201cThe procedure is dangerous, and <em>exhausting</em>, and it\u2019s only temporary. If the feelings come back, it doesn\u2019t end. The flowers can grow back, it might never end, and then you have to go back and get the surgery all over again. And again. And again, and each time you hope and you wish and you <em>pray</em> that this time, the flowers will finally give up for good.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Katsuki tore his eyes away, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh bitterly. He was starting to understand what was going on here. \u201cYou trying to talk me out of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Listen to me</em>,\u201d Todoroki urged, the passion in his voice reaching levels far beyond anything Katsuki could have expected. \u201cEven with Recovery Girl\u2019s quirk, healing takes <em>days</em>. Each time, her quirk left me so fatigued that she swore she would never do it again. If it comes back, I have to recover without her. She\u2019s not going to make an exception for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like Recovery Girl is the only person with a healing quirk. Newsflash, she isn\u2019t, dumbass,\u201d Katsuki hissed, frustration crawling under his skin. \u201cThere\u2019ll be another way. You just wanna stay ahead of me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s fists clenched dangerously, his knuckles turning white. \u201cGet your head out of your ass. <em>Idiot</em>. You think I wanted it? You think I\u2019d willingly put myself through that?\u201d The tone in his voice, it was\u2026 dangerous, like something within him had snapped. When he spoke again, it shook with actual anger. \u201cMy father <em>forces </em>me to get the surgery. The first time, he didn\u2019t even tell me what was going on, just drove me, dropped me off, didn\u2019t say a word except to the nurses, it was over before I even knew what was wrong with me, before I even knew who\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, as if only now able to regain control of his runaway mouth, Todoroki cut himself off. His breaths were coming out short from his outburst, and for a moment, he just breathed. Then, he straightened his back, shook his head as if to clear it. With a swallow, he looked back to his textbook, as if that was the end of that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Katsuki just stared at him, aghast.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a question.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s shoulders tensed even more than they already were. \u201cGet back to work,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, how the <em>fuck</em> do you not know who it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki screwed his eyes shut, lips pursed into a line, like he was in actual pain, and for a moment Katsuki wasn\u2019t even sure he would be able to respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the surgery,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice finally broke out, like he was being stretched so thin that he could snap at any moment, \u201cit dampens feelings. And I\u2019ve never been good at those anyways. If I so much as cough, he rushes to the hospital, and then I wake up in an operating room and I try, I try as hard as I can to feel again so I can know, and I just\u2026 <em>can\u2019t</em>.\u201d He caught his breath with a steady inhale, then an exhale, face pinched with all the ache in the world. \u201cEvery day I\u2019m haunted by the possibility of having to live the rest of my life knowing that I was in love but never knowing who.\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence felt alive. It rushed up Katsuki\u2019s spine like chills, blanketing them.</p>\n<p>Then, with a tilt of his head, eyebrows scrunched together, Katsuki spoke. \u201cIs\u2026 that why you\u2019re usually so\u2026.?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy I\u2019m so <em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki only stared at him. \u201c\u2026 Blank?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki blinked. \u201cSurgery only affects the feeling of love. Other emotions stay the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, he really was just Like That.</p>\n<p>And Todoroki, he actually let out a hum, and it almost sounded amused in a cynical sort of way. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m projecting on to you,\u201d he spoke, his words much more composed. Much more like his typical self. \u201c\u2026but you don\u2019t want the surgery. It\u2019s hell. Besides, you\u2019re lucky. Despite what you think, you have a chance, which is more than I will ever have. Don\u2019t throw it away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki didn\u2019t believe that, <em>couldn\u2019t </em>believe that, and it pissed him off that Todoroki could possibly call him <em>lucky</em>. But some part of him couldn\u2019t help the pity that was growing inside of him, the pity that told him to keep his mouth shut before he made said something he would regret. He tried once again to use his schoolwork as a distraction. Todoroki seemed to take the hint, for he followed suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it doesn\u2019t matter anyways,\u201d Katsuki finally mumbled, passively. \u201cI\u2019m transferring classes next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a sharp inhale beside him. \u201c\u2026What?\u201d</p>\n<p>So Aizawa hadn\u2019t said anything yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m moving to Class 1B.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could feel the eyes upon him. He shifted uncomfortably, writing his next answer on the worksheet.</p>\n<p>Todoroki tapped his pencil against his paper a few times. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna switch places with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2026 sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fucking say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Was that\u2026 concern?</p>\n<p>Katsuki lifted and dropped his shoulders limply. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried about you,\u201d Todoroki swallowed, turning to his homework once again. \u201cKeeps asking me about you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki froze. For a moment, there was pressure in his chest, a tickling in his throat. He let out a deep cough, trying his best to keep any petals at bay.</p>\n<p>Todoroki continued. \u201cYou still have feelings for him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>That time, the petals really did come, just a few, and Katsuki gasped on them, coughing them out until they finally stopped. Like it was routine, Todoroki gave him the tissue box without even looking up from his paper.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking\u2026 Goddamn it, Todoroki, the medicine doesn\u2019t work that well. That\u2019s why I\u2019m fucking switching classes in the first place. Fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did that on purpose didn\u2019t you? You fucker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSwear I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Katsuki <em>tch</em>ed.</p>\n<p>Once again, he aimed the wad of used tissues to the trashcan. It bounced off the wall before landing squarely in the center. Score.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does he bother with worrying about me anyways?\u201d He muttered. \u201c\u2018S not his business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s your best friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go throwing around labels for us, fucker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>But, that wasn\u2019t entirely it, and Katsuki knew it. Eventually, he let out a weak little sigh. His voice was impossibly small. \u201c\u2026You\u2019re right, though. He is. And, I\u2026\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t lose that. And, with transferring classes, that\u2019s what will happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, with you wanting the surgery, it sounds to me like you were trying to give up. Take the easy way out, even if it causes more problems than good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki froze. \u201c\u2019Easy way out\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s easy, isn\u2019t it? Not wanting to feel something when it hurts. But hurting is part of life. So live with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked away, a grunt of warning catching in his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t care about how I feel,\u201d he mumbled, some air of finality settling into his voice, \u201cnot if losing him is the result.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room fell silent, for just a moment, and it was <em>heavy</em>. It rested like a weight on top of them, and Katsuki needed something to distract from it because it was too much. He opened his textbook again, setting to work.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still go to UA, don\u2019t you? So what does it matter if you switch classes? You\u2019ll still see him. And, he cares about you. You have a chance, so don\u2019t take the easy way out.\u201d</p>\n<p>At those words, Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but look up, catching Todoroki\u2019s eyes, ones that dared to stare past his fa\u00e7ade, right into his core. And in that moment, Katsuki found himself staring past Todoroki\u2019s fa\u00e7ade, too, finding in him more than he ever wanted to see.</p>\n<p>Todoroki spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t throw it away.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki wanted to feel angry at Todoroki. Who did this guy think he was, giving him fucking advice or some shit? As far as he was concerned, it was unsolicited and fucking <em>out of line</em>.</p>\n<p>But something about that simple sentence hit him. Maybe it was the commanding tone that made the words ring around in his ears even seconds after they were spoken. Maybe it was the overwhelming regret that he found hidden deep in Todoroki\u2019s features. Whatever it was, it hit him <em>hard.</em></p>\n<p>The surgery, an easy way out? He had just been thinking of it as his only reasonable option, not some fucking <em>easy way out</em>. But as he tried to turn back to his studies, something about what Todoroki said, starting to blast holes into all of that.</p>\n<p>It gave him hope. If the medicine worked even a fraction of a bit, then moving classes was only the end of their friendship if he allowed it to be. And the feelings that he still had, the ones that Todoroki saw as a blessing\u2026. did he really have a chance to turn that into something more? With Hanahaki, was that even a possibility?</p>\n<p>Katsuki wasn\u2019t sure what to believe anymore. But, for the first time in a long time, he knew what had to be done.</p>\n<p>That night, Dad closed the front door behind their guests as they left. \u201cJust one more of those to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be back at UA.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprised you guys and Aizawa haven\u2019t run out of things to talk about,\u201d Katsuki grumbled as he trudged his way to the living room. His parents followed close behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>Mr. </em>Aizawa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad had a habit of reminding him about stuff like that, and it usually got on his fucking nerves. But tonight, Katsuki was calm. As if he had resigned himself to his fate. So, he plopped down on the couch without a word, eyes unfocused ahead of him.</p>\n<p>His mom watched him, her scrutinizing gaze vigilant, as if watching for is every movement and breath. After a second, she plopped down next to him and sighed. \u201cOkay kiddo, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did my research,\u201d he piped up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, did you now?\u201d His mom leaned back, crossing her arms. \u201cAnd what did you find?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless of what I found, you shouldn\u2019t have made that sort of decisions without me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cKatsuki\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me speak.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was demanding, but not cruel. Just enough to get his parents to shut up and actually listen to him for once.</p>\n<p>As soon as he was sure he had their attention, Katsuki continued. \u201cDoes UA know it\u2019s him?\u201d</p>\n<p>The look that his parents exchanged was one of surprise. They said nothing, and with that silence came the reminder of what he most feared. Maybe, he was too late. It was like something icy was grabbing his heart, pulling it downwards, making it sink further in his chest. He breathed, trying to calm the way stomach twisting in knots in a way that had nothing to do with the roses.</p>\n<p>He had to continue, before their silence could consume him whole.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll concede to changing classes,\u201d he said simply, with a casual shrug. \u201cNo fights, no arguments \u2013 on one condition. Kirishima is\u2026 He\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve ever been able to get along with. My only friend, the only person who likes me how I am. I can\u2019t lose that.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way his words were forming, revealing all of his feelings without his consent, laying them out in the open, plain as day for his parents to see\u2026 it was all too much, it wasn\u2019t supposed to go like this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cListen,\u201d he tried again, an even stronger edge of desperation creeping into his tone, \u201cI\u2019m willing to deal with the occasional petals. And if I can\u2019t train at all like that, then I\u2019ll even to go back to the shittier medicine. Wait for my body to get used to it. But if they know it\u2019s him, they might not let me see him anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was trembling, but no matter how much he fought against it, he couldn\u2019t stop it. He hated this, he hated this so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo please,\u201d he breathed, dreading the answer that may come, \u201cPlease tell me they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he was finished, his parents just looked at him.</p>\n<p>Finally, his mom reached out to rub his back. Her words were rushed. <em>Relieved</em>. \u201cWe haven\u2019t said anything more than that it\u2019s a classmate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe promise.\u201d His dad placed a hand on his shoulder, another anchor for him to focus on. \u201cWe figured that was your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>He screwed his eyes shut. It felt like he was signing a part of his life away. But now he realized \u2013 this was the best he could do for now.</p>\n<p>So, much to his parents relief, he nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Whatever, then it\u2019s settled. I concede.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tomorrow was the big day. Bakugou Katsuki\u2019s grand return to UA.</p>\n<p>Katsuki knew he should have felt more excited than he did. With each day, something inside of him should have been itching away, biting at the bit to return to classes and training. But instead, he had just been sleeping a lot, the countdown to his return bringing about a stronger and stronger sense of... indifference.</p>\n<p>He honestly couldn\u2019t tell if that was the new medicine\u2019s doing or not.</p>\n<p>Downstairs, he could hear the doorbell ring. He flipped to his side, staring at the wall, wanting nothing more than to go back to sleep.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe\u2019s just up in his room,\u201d</em> he heard his mom say.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dinner\u2019s almost done,\u201d</em> he heard his father say.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s footsteps up the stairs felt slower than normal, each one like another countdown, just one more step closer to UA. To <em>Class 1-B</em>.</p>\n<p>When his door creaked open, Katsuki let out a groan. \u201cFucking took you long enough, icy-hot,\u201d he pushed himself to sitting, pivoting to swing his legs over the side of the bed, \u201csounded like you were marching in a funeral procession or someth\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s breath caught in his throat. He stared.</p>\n<p>Kirishima was standing in his doorway.</p>\n<p>His expression was kind. <em>Pained</em>. \u201cHey, man,\u201d he tried to smile.</p>\n<p>And Katsuki\u2019s first thought was that this was all some sick prank. Then, it was that whoever was involved would <em>pay </em>for trying to fix his love-life. Probably his mother. The heart in his chest pounded, so quickly, stomach fluttering wildly. The roses, they squirmed, wanting nothing more than to escape, their sickening aroma already filling his airways. It took all of his will to hold them down. His struggle against them felt like it lasted eons as time slowed to a crawl, but finally, for the first time, they released their hold and Katsuki found that he could breathe again.</p>\n<p>He blinked, snapping out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kirishima chuckled nervously, hand rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI figured, you\u2019ve tutored me enough times, it\u2019s about time I returned the favor, so here I am!\u201d He glanced around the room. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>And that was one of the worst ideas Katsuki had ever heard in his life. Of course it was, there was no way.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Don\u2019t throw it away.\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s words rang around in his head, and he couldn\u2019t shake them no matter how hard he tried. Kirishima was there. An opportunity, to prove to himself that he could do this. That, in spite of everything, he could still be Kirishima\u2019s friend.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Kirishima beamed, and it looked like something had been lifted off of his shoulders. He trotted over to the bedside and in an instant, set his backpack down and took a seat on the floor, back against the bed, like they had done so many times before.</p>\n<p>Katsuki hesitated. He couldn\u2019t help it, this wasn\u2019t how the day was supposed to go, and he had every right to believe that it would now end in disaster. But, the petals were unusually quiet. No disaster in sight. Maybe\u2026 maybe that was the hope that Todoroki had given him? So he gave in, quickly sliding down to take the space next to Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright-y, let\u2019s begin!\u201d Kirishima dug around in his backpack, tongue sticking out like a complete <em>dork</em>. \u201cHmm, what to do first\u2026\u201d he pulled out a notebook, \u201cAha! Algebra!\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe this actually <em>would </em>end in disaster after all. Kirishima sucked at math.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe the guy had gotten better, Katsuki wasn\u2019t gonna give up on him just yet. He grabbed his own notebook, and the two of them quickly set to work.</p>\n<p>And yup. Kirishima still sucked at math.</p>\n<p>Seriously, Katsuki was the one who hadn\u2019t been in class for almost a week and a half, yet by the time his mother knocked on the door with their dinner in hand, somehow <em>he</em> had ended up tutoring <em>Kirishima</em>. But with the scent of curry fresh in their noses, the two put their work aside.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for the food Mrs. Bakugou,\u201d Kirishima grinned again, grabbing the plate from her outstretched hand, \u201cIt smells delicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are too kind, Kirishima,\u201d her voice dripped with sweetness. \u201cAnd for you, Katsuki,\u201d she handed the plate down.</p>\n<p>Katsuki glared at her. He didn\u2019t grab the plate.</p>\n<p>She shook it a little. <em>Take it.</em></p>\n<p>With a huff \u2013 so she\u2019d know that he wasn\u2019t happy about it \u2013 he took the food.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t get the wrong idea, young man,\u201d Mom raised her eyebrows, motioning quickly to the oblivious Kirishima. \u201c<em>This</em> wasn\u2019t my doing. \u2026You okay, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have the patience for her sass today, so he muttered a sour \u201cJust leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. You two work hard!\u201d She said over her shoulder before leaving and closing the door behind her.</p>\n<p>Kirishima turned to him, cheeks full of rice like a chipmunk. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki grabbed his chopsticks. \u201cForget about it,\u201d he grumbled before stuffing his face.</p>\n<p>Just like that, Kirishima shrugged, any concern of his immediately replaced with thoughts of food. The two quickly finished their meal and returned to Algebra.</p>\n<p>And everything Kirishima did, from his frustrated little muttering to his shouts of joy, just served as a reminder of just how much Katsuki loved this\u2026 and of just how much he was going to miss it when they were in different classes. Soon, they began with the next subject that Kirishima happened to pull out of his backpack \u2013 English. Which, the guy wasn\u2019t actually that bad with. They worked on the assignment together, a short paragraph using some conditional sentences and at least six prepositions. Then, into their second hour, Classical Japanese. Ten years of school so far, and they had somehow still not read enough Haikus, it would seem.</p>\n<p>They talked about Class 1-A, too. Rather, Kirishima talked, and talked and talked and talked, and Katsuki pretended not to listen. That wasn\u2019t the sort of stuff that Todoroki bothered mentioning, not that he would have cared if the guy had. But now, it was Kirishima talking to him, gossiping like any other day. On one hand, Katsuki could pretend like everything was normal. But on the other hand, hearing about the student\u2019s lives served as a painful reminder \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t be a part of that class again. So today, Katsuki listened.</p>\n<p>And all too quickly, they approached the end of their time together. As the seconds ticked away, Katsuki couldn\u2019t shake the bittersweet flavor from his mouth. Their last time studying together as classmates was almost at an end.</p>\n<p>And, the way Kirishima was acting, frowning when he thought Katsuki wasn\u2019t looking at him, nearly panicking when he saw the time on his phone\u2026 it was almost as if he knew that this was it, too. Maybe Mr. Aizawa had finally gotten around to telling the class.</p>\n<p>Their friendship would continue, hopefully. It didn\u2019t have to end today. But a part of him still wanted to hope. A part of him wanted to believe that maybe something more would come of it. Even now, it was starting to hurt. Maybe, it was that hope that needed to die, to keep their friendship alive.</p>\n<p>They had reached a lull in the conversation, each hoping to finish up the last of their Chemistry equation before time was up, when Kirishima took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Bakugou?\u201d</p>\n<p>The way he said it made Katsuki\u2019s stomach do flip-flops. He turned to where Kirishima sat next to him. He was reminded of all the times they had been together, side by side, and it <em>hurt</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s been really nice.\u201d Kirishima smiled, but something wasn\u2019t really right about it. \u201cIt\u2019s really great to see you again and I feel like you\u2019re happy to see me too, but I just, want to make sure. We\u2019re\u2026\u201d he trailed off, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cWe\u2019re okay, right? Everything\u2019s cool between us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki stared ahead. There was no way this fucking conversation was happening. Not now. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d he tried passively.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s like\u2026 when I last saw you, back then, when we were sparring, and then, you know\u2026\u201d Kirishima stumbled over his words, sentences not fully forming, \u201c\u2026 and I haven\u2019t heard from you since, not even a text, or <em>anything</em>, and we\u2019re\u2026\u201d he shrugged limply. Lifelessly. \u201cWe <em>are </em>friends, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026This entire time, Kirishima had been worrying about<em> that</em>?</p>\n<p>Before his thumping heart could drown out his thoughts, Katsuki gave a curt nod. \u201cOf course. Friends.\u201d His mouth was dry, his words like molasses. He swallowed the lump that had settled in his throat, feeling his stomach twist and churn. \u201cJust friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust friends...\u201d Kirishima agreed.</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked down, fighting down the petals with all of his might. Leaving his voice behind, his mouth formed the words again, a reminder to himself:</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Just friends.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes.</p>\n<p>There was a cough. Then another. And more and more, gravely and scratchy and painful-sounding, until there was, fluttering to the ground, a single damp rose petal.</p>\n<p>But it was not Katsuki\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\n<em>There was a cough. Then another. And more and more, gravely and scratchy and painful-sounding, until there was, fluttering to the ground, a single damp rose petal.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>But it was not Katsuki\u2019s.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinked a few times. For several moments, that was the only thing he could do, his brain was too occupied with thoughts of \u2018<em>What The Fuck</em>\u2019 to do much else.</p>\n<p>The sound of labored breathing filled the room \u2013 Kirishima\u2019s breaths, heavy and coarse. His shoulders shuddered with every inhale and exhale, hand clenched desperately at his chest as if hoping to relieve the discomfort, the <em>pain</em>. As time passed, slowly, Kirishima\u2019s breathing evened out to a more manageable pant. He reached up to wipe away the strand of saliva that had been dripping from his mouth.</p>\n<p>Kirishima stared down wide-eyed at the petal that lay in his lap.</p>\n<p>After a beat, he cleared his throat. \u201cO-kaay\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound of his voice snapped everything back into focus. The \u2018<em>What the Fuck</em>\u2019s that had been circling around in his head diminished, but were quickly replaced by a new thought \u2013 \u2018<em>No one told me this shit was contagious</em>\u2019.</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s eyebrows knitted together. The longer he studied the petal \u2013 poking at it, lifting it to eye-level, examining it \u2013 the more uneasy his expression became.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in the world\u2026?\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>Curiously, he held the petal up to the light, like a cashier testing a bill for authenticity. Then he dropped it, as if spooked. As if reality was finally setting in, as if <em>panic </em>was finally setting in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d He stumbled, the words catching in the back of his throat. \u201cThis is\u2026 I\u2019ve never\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but <em>what the hell is this?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHanahaki,\u201d Katsuki stated dumbly. His mouth was dry. \u201cHanahaki Disorder. It\u2019s\u2026 rare,\u201d he added, because yeah, it <em>was</em> rare, so <em>this shouldn\u2019t be possible</em>.</p>\n<p>Kirishima lifted his head, doe-eyed. \u201cFlower\u2026 spit-up?\u201d A tense sort-of laugh escaped between his lips. \u201cWell, they certainly call it what it is. But, what\u2019s\u2026?\u201d he trailed off, an edge of panic creeping into his voice once again. \u201cI-I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t like Katsuki did, either. No one did. Even so, Kirishima deserved as good an explanation as Katsuki could offer. But the shock was still fogging up his head. This illness that had plagued him, rendering him useless for <em>weeks</em>... How could he even begin to explain something like that?</p>\n<p>He opened his mouth. Closed it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on Bakugou, you\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d Kirishima scratched the back of his neck. \u201cYou know what this is, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He certainly did know what it was, it had been his own personal hell for the past month. He knew it all too well. And he knew this shit <em>wasn\u2019t</em> contagious. Which meant\u2026</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinked. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s cheeks went pale.</p>\n<p>\u201cW\u2026 <em>What??</em>\u201d he squeaked.</p>\n<p>With a palm pressed against his floor, Katsuki turned onto a knee, facing Kirishima head-on. \u201cKirishima\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He let out a little amused huff, because the fog was finally clearing from his mind and everything was starting to fall into place and it was <em>ridiculous</em>. It didn\u2019t make sense, it was too good to be true, and yet, the crimson petal spelled it out in bold. And, maybe he was being too confrontational. Maybe he was being a little unfair. But he had to know for sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p>\n<p>In an instant, the world around them froze, like it was holding its breath alongside them. A journey crossed Kirishima\u2019s face. First were his wide eyes, reluctant, disbelieving. Then was his gaze retreating, hazy and unfocused, as if searching within himself for an answer that he wasn\u2019t even sure was there. Then at last, his eyes met once again with Katsuki\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something within Katsuki\u2019s chest began to unfurl, and he wanted to shout, or laugh, or cry, or everything all at once because <em>finally</em>. But he couldn\u2019t let himself feel relief. Not yet. Not when Kirishima was turning away, embarrassed, unable to meet his gaze. Not when Kirishima still didn\u2019t realize just how much he meant to Katsuki.</p>\n<p>No, there was something he needed to do first.</p>\n<p>As if in a trance, he reached out, slowly, until his palm covered the hand that lay in Kirishima\u2019s lap. He gave a reassuring squeeze. Kirishima sat, captivated by where their hands met. Gently, he opened his fist, watching as their fingers intertwined.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Katsuki spoke.</p>\n<p>Kirishima peered up to him, scared and confused and <em>hopeful</em>, and Katsuki\u2019s heart surged. He could feel the corners of his mouth upturn, just the littlest bit, could feel the way his eyes softened.</p>\n<p>Finally, he could admit what he should have admitted to himself ages ago. Finally, he could accept it fully and without reservation. Finally, <em>finally</em>, he could say it, out loud, to the one person in the word who deserved to hear it most.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too, Kirishima Eijirou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s breath hitched. His hand clamped down painfully on Katsuki\u2019s fingers. In an instant, he was gasping again, his whole body shaking.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s eyes flew shut as a wave of familiar sensations washed over him. It must have been what Kirishima was feeling too, but for the first time. There was writhing around in his chest as the vines twisted around, the pressure building and building and Katsuki braced himself for what he knew was soon to follow.</p>\n<p>But instead of the scent of roses, instead the hacking and coughing that he had come to expect, there was\u2026 nothing. All at once, it just stopped.</p>\n<p>There was no way it was as easy as that. No way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Kirishima wheezed out through his shuddering breaths, \u201c\u2014<em>What</em> was <em>that</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>There had to be something else going on. There was no way the petals were done just like that, and yet\u2026 He took a deep breath. And, he could <em>breathe</em>. As if he hadn\u2019t even realized how little he could breathe before. He inhaled deeply again. Exhale. And again. And again, relishing in the unobstructed feeling.</p>\n<p>Finally, his voice came to him. \u201cI think, that was you being cured.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Cured</em>?\u201d Kirishima looked up to him. \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>The only words that came to mind were ones that his doctor had uttered. Slowly, Katsuki repeated them, verbatim: \u201cA person who is susceptible to developing Hanahaki Disorder is someone who experiences a deep love that is unrequited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a thing?\u201d Kirishima\u2019s eyes widened. He continued slowly, carefully. \u201cAnd because I\u2026 felt that way, about you, then I\u2026?\u201d He looked down at where their hands were still joined. Then, he looked over to the petal in his lap. \u201cHow the heck does that even work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugged. Hell if he knew.</p>\n<p>Kirishima glanced up, making eye contact with Katsuki once more before quickly averting his eyes. \u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d he swatted his free hand in front of his face frantically, as if that would distract Katsuki from his crimson cheeks. \u201cThis is just a lot to take in, how do you even know about all of this anyways?\u201d</p>\n<p>Since it was mutual, it shouldn\u2019t have felt as embarrassing as it did. Katsuki knew that. And he didn\u2019t want Kirishima to see his reaction and think that it was something he should be ashamed about, either.</p>\n<p>But, he had been holding on to this secret for so long. Even before he accepted the nature of his feelings. For that reason, admitting his condition left him feeling vulnerable in a way that his love confession hadn\u2019t. It was fucking stupid, and it didn\u2019t make sense. But even still, it was his secret. Letting it go was not easy. But that didn\u2019t matter. Kirishima deserved to know.</p>\n<p>Katsuki closed his eyes. Took a deep breath. \u201cBecause, I think I was just cured, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>The air stilled, weighing heavily down on him. He could hear his heart beat against his eardrums.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d Kirishima finally muttered, his voice warm. \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>His body was frozen, unable to respond.</p>\n<p>Kirishima seemed to understand. He gave his hand a gentle squeeze. \u201cEveryone knew something was wrong. But we didn\u2019t want to talk about it behind your back, so we tried ignoring it. But it was difficult, I was so worried. But, all that time when you weren\u2019t acting like yourself\u2026 When you had to sit out for training. And when you fell. And, being sent home. <em>This</em> was why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of how you feel about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of it was the shitty medicine\u2019s fault,\u201d Katsuki explained, because Kirishima was exactly the type of person who would try to blame himself over something like this. \u201cIt fucked with my balance and shit. Here.\u201d He held out the tissue box.</p>\n<p>As if still in a daze, Kirishima cleaned himself up and tossed the tissues away.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2026 You love me.\u201d It was like Kirishima was stuck on it. Like he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it no matter how hard he tried.</p>\n<p>Katsuki closed his eyes. Nodded.</p>\n<p>The air around them teetered on the edge of what was sure to be a suffocating silence. But before it could settle, Kirishima barked out a laugh. \u201cOh man. <em>Oh man</em>, I thought you <em>hated </em>me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d Katsuki\u2019s eyelids snapped open. Of all the reactions he\u2019d been expecting, <em>that </em>had not been one of them. \u201cYou kidding? Why the <em>fuck</em> would I hate you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I knew we were friends, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Kirishima shrugged. \u201cWell, you know, with what happened last week when we were sparring. It was so good to see you back in your element, you were so happy like that, and it made me happy too, and I guess I just got a little wound up. But when I went to kiss you, you pushed me away, so I\u2026 I mean I just assumed\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d In an instant, Katsuki\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou fucking <em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 why you pushed me away, right? Because you didn\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I pushed you away because I needed to spit up rose petals into a fucking toilet. <em>Not</em> because I didn\u2019t <em>want</em>\u2026\u201d Katsuki snapped his mouth shut. He flushed deep red. What followed was a nearly-unintelligible mumble. \u201cGuess we really were on the same fuckin\u2019 page.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god. Oh my god, I had no idea. I thought I had read the atmosphere wrong. And when Mr. Aizawa told us that you were transferring to Class 1B, I thought you wanted to get away from me. That sparring had been the last straw, and you saw me as a distraction. Or a nuisance. I knew I just couldn\u2019t let it happen without setting the records straight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s smile was warm, a little sheepish. \u201cI was so scared that my dumb feelings had finally messed up our friendship, and it made me feel sick. Seriously, dude. I\u2019ve been in love with you for months. And I didn\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Katsuki didn\u2019t quite know how to take this information. He averted his eyes, hoping to god that he didn\u2019t look <em>bashful</em> or some shit. \u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima squeezed his hand. \u201c<em>Really</em> really.\u201d</p>\n<p>And maybe it was just now setting in, that this was happening. And <em>fuck</em>, it was a lot to take in, and he still didn\u2019t understand it. But that didn\u2019t stop it from being <em>real</em>. Katsuki looked to where their hands met. The breath he let out was wobbly.</p>\n<p>Kirishima watched him, concerned. \u201cBakugou\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>, it\u2019s so stupid,\u201d Katsuki groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s just, this has been ripping me apart, for <em>so fucking long</em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Kirishima\u2019s voice rooted him, calmed him. \u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you so much, Katsuki,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo much, you have no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t make any fucking sense, but Kirishima kept saying it and kept <em>showing</em> it \u2013 with his smile and the way his thumb rubbed gentle circles into Katsuki\u2019s hand \u2013 so it must be true.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re both okay now.\u201d Each word that Kirishima spoke sent warmth through Katsuki. \u201cIt\u2019s not unrequited. We just thought it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that was something Katsuki hadn\u2019t even considered before now. That before, it hadn\u2019t mattered if Kirishima felt the same way or not. What mattered was that he had convinced himself that there was no way Kirishima cared about him as much as he cared about Kirishima.</p>\n<p>The silence that followed was comforting. For a moment, they didn\u2019t have to say anything. Being next to each other, their fingers interlocked, was enough.</p>\n<p>Just then, his mom called from the bottom of the staircase, \u201cBoys! Time to pack up!\u201d Because <em>of course</em>, she just <em>had</em> to ruin the goddamn moment.</p>\n<p>At her voice, they froze. Katsuki didn\u2019t want their time to be over. Not so soon, not when there was still so much to talk about. And, it seemed as though Kirishima didn\u2019t want it to be over, either. His face was panicked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you still going to have to move to Class 1B?\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Give us a sec!</em>\u201d Bakugou shouted. He brought his attention back to Kirishima. \u201cNot if I can help it though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s panic faded into a sort-of shy smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d Then, he deflated, just a bit. \u201cGuess it\u2019s time for me to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some subconscious part of Katsuki\u2019s mind made him tighten his grip on Kirishima\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can text?\u201d Kirishima\u2019s voice was hopeful.</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugged, passively. Still, his grip tightened. At that, Kirishima let out a little laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Bakugou, you\u2019re gonna have to let go of my hand eventually\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima lifted his head, eyes wide. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Right. Katsuki.\u201d \u00a0As the name rolled off of his lips, Kirishima swayed happily. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s Eijirou. If you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eijirou.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Something about thinking it, about letting his mouth form the name quietly, was such a relief. Nothing could stop the soft smile that lit up his face. Finally, he let go of Kirishima\u2019s \u2014 of <em>Eijirou</em>\u2019s hand, so he wouldn\u2019t get in the way of school supply packing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should probably get checked out by a doctor or something,\u201d Katsuki mulled aloud, watching Eijirou file his notebooks into his backpack. \u201cRecovery Girl at the very least. Just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, maybe, don\u2019t mention it until you\u2019re in the car with Aizawa? My parents would cause a fucking <em>scene</em>, and it\u2019d just be embarrassing for all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou\u2019s laugh practically shimmered in the air. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stood, slinging his backpack over his shoulder and reaching his hand down. Katsuki took Eijirou\u2019s hand, allowing the strong grip to help him to his feet. Even with his feet planted sturdily under him, neither of them broke the contact. They entered the hallway, shoulder to shoulder, only letting go of each other\u2019s hand when they reached the top of the staircase. Kirishima bounded down the stairs \u2013 Katsuki not far behind \u2013 and joined Mr. Aizawa in the <em>genkan</em> to put on his shoes.</p>\n<p>Katsuki shoved his hands into his sweatpants and leaned against a wall, trying to feign disinterest as his parents bothered with formalities. Anything to hide how crestfallen he felt seeing Eijirou leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief this plan has worked as well as it has, but it\u2019ll be good for your son to be back at UA.\u201d Aizawa muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d his mom bowed, \u201cand we cannot thank you enough for your willingness to help our son. Both of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was no problem at all!\u201d Eijirou beamed at her. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I got to see him again.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled at Eijirou, kindly, but the smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes. When she glanced at Katsuki, for a split second, some sort of expression cross his mother\u2019s face. Was it\u2026 disappointment?</p>\n<p>A part of Katsuki wanted to laugh. She was in for the surprise of the century. But that would have to wait.</p>\n<p>Dad swung the front door open, beckoning the guests over the threshold and into the air of late evening. The Bakugous watched from the entryway as Eijirou and Aizawa crossed the lawn to the sleek black car that was parked along the curb.</p>\n<p>Each step that Eijirou took was a step further away from Katsuki. Even if Katsuki did manage to return to Class 1A, that didn\u2019t stop the distance that grew between them from stinging, just a little bit. He wasn\u2019t used to having someone to miss.</p>\n<p><em>Tomorrow</em>, he mentally chided himself. He would see Eijirou again tomorrow. And they would text until then. No need to be this fucking pathetic about it.</p>\n<p>But when they were about halfway to the car, Eijirou froze. He turned on his heel and darted up the sidewalk, up to the house, up to Katsuki. And before Katsuki could even register what was happening, there were arms wrapped around his torso, tightly, embracing him.</p>\n<p>His parents beside him gasped, and for a second, Katsuki could only stand, stunned. He wasn\u2019t used to this sort of thing. But, it was just Kirishima. Just Eijirou. With a sigh, he closed his eyes and returned the embrace, taking in every sensation that he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima\u2014\u201d Aizawa called.</p>\n<p>The arms around him hugged even tighter. \u201cGotta go,\u201d Eijirou muttered in his ear.</p>\n<p>As he pulled back, he pressed his lips against Katsuki\u2019s cheek. And then the arms around him were gone and Eijirou dashed on ahead.</p>\n<p>As he jogged back to the car, Eijirou turned to wave at Katsuki. \u201cSee you at school!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki watched him go, wide-eyes blinking in a daze. \u201cSee you at school,\u201d he responded, too quietly for anyone but himself to hear.</p>\n<p>As the car doors slapped shut, his mother let out a piercing shriek. His dad\u2019s hand ruffle his hair. But it didn\u2019t even bother him. He could only reach his hand up, hovering over his cheek, where Kirishima\u2019s lips had pressed just moments before. He smiled, dumbly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mom took the news about as obnoxiously as he thought she would. There had been a lot of squealing. And hugging, from both of his parents. A lot of questions, \u2018<em>What brought this on, huh?</em>\u2019, \u2018<em>What the fuck do you mean he has it too?</em>\u2019, \u2018<em>Okay punk, start from the beginning, tell me everything</em>\u2019. And it was fucking insufferable. Deep down, he knew it was just because she cared a lot. Even deeper down he couldn\u2019t help but wonder <em>why</em>. So, he had stuck to answering as sparsely as she would allow.</p>\n<p>Then, there were phone calls to make. A lot of phone calls to make.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, returning to UA wasn\u2019t as simple has Katsuki had hoped it would be. UA preferred that he check in with his doctor first, and it was difficult scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment on such short notice. So he apparently wasn\u2019t returning to UA until the following evening.</p>\n<p>There were still meetings to schedule and logistics to work through. Boring shit that had the potential to last well into the night. His dad was the best at that sort of thing, so he took over that operation. His voice carried faintly into the living room from the kitchen. Unfortunately, that left him in the sole presence of his mother and what were bound to be a lot more questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHang in there, kiddo,\u201d Mom beamed, but otherwise she was unexpectedly calm. She leaned against the couch\u2019s armrest next to him and ruffled his hair. \u201cThings\u2019ll fall back into place before you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit it,\u201d Katsuki swatted her hand away and sank into the couch cushions in evasion. After a moment, he let out a snort. \u201cAbout goddamn time. Can\u2019t happen soon enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi. Patience is a fucking virtue.\u201d She was still smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy for you to say, ya old hag. You\u2019re not the one who\u2019s been coughing that shit up for weeks on end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess I can\u2019t argue with that, huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s phone let out a buzz.</p>\n<p>It was Kirishima.<em> Eijirou</em>, he mentally reminded himself. He could call him Eijirou now.</p>\n<p>Eijirou\u2019s check-up had apparently gone very well. According to him, Recovery Girl had said that the disorder hadn\u2019t had the time to cause significant damage. But still, Eijirou whined about being told to sit out the following day\u2019s training. Seemed as though UA had had enough of flower-barfing students causing further harm to themselves. They were not too keen on taking any more chances.</p>\n<p>Katsuki quickly shot back a text and pocketed his phone, before his mom had the chance to get nosy about it.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, she was smiling at him with a knowing glint in her eyes. Slowly, she sank into the cushions next to him. Even as he kept his eyes locked on the TV screen, absently absorbing the evening news, he could feel her gaze boring into him.</p>\n<p>After a moment, she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found someone, Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinked. His first instinct was to protest, because <em>seriously</em>. Hearing sappy shit like that, from his <em>mother</em> of all people, was weird as hell. But then another thought came to mind, cutting his retort short. What would bring her to say something like <em>that </em>in the first place?</p>\n<p>And then it occurred to him \u2013 perhaps, Mom hadn\u2019t thought it was possible. He was volatile, and really fucking unpleasant sometimes, and Katsuki knew that. So, maybe some part of her had been resigned to accept that it would never happen. That he would live his entire life without finding someone who he would love. Someone who would love him in return.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t blame her, not entirely. Not when he had convinced himself of the same thing, too.</p>\n<p>The silence that surrounded them was more comfortable than not, the white noises of his father talking in the kitchen and the TV at low volume droning in the background. Mindlessly, they watched the week\u2019s weather forecast.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Katsuki finally asked, to no one in particular. \u201cWhy <em>him</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he seems like a nice kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fucking understatement of the century,\u201d Katsuki muttered, some part of him having the audacity to be amused about it. \u201cHe\u2019s so goddamn nice. <em>Too</em> goddamn nice, to everyone, to <em>me</em>, and it makes me feel all weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d She raised an eyebrow curiously. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p>\n<p>And <em>fuck</em>, Katsuki knew what she was playing at. And he\u2019d be <em>damned </em>if his mom got him to start monologuing about sentimental shit like <em>feelings</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cMind your own damn business.\u201d It was all bark, no bite. Sulking, he gave out a little shrug. \u201c\u2019S not like I wanna feel all that shit in the first place. I\u2019d be a lot better off if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0When Mom looked over to him, her brows were drawn together, and there was something sad in her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki didn\u2019t know what he meant. So, he shrugged again.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d Mom let out a sigh. \u201cHow you feel for that boy, and how he feels for you\u2026 It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Christ, did his mom have to go and make this a fucking sap-fest? His cheeks began burning immediately. With a huff, he turned away, remaining pointedly quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove is a beautiful thing, Katsuki, it really is.\u201d She took his silence as an opportunity to continue. Her hand rubbed one of his shoulders. \u201cAnd I\u2019m worried that, with all that\u2019s happened, you\u2019ll start to resent those feelings. That you\u2019ll push them away, even more than you did before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWould you blame me if I did?\u201d His voice was barely above a whisper. God, he hated how his voice cracked on the words.</p>\n<p>Mom said nothing at first. She just watched him, carefully, and Katsuki shifted under her gaze. After a moment, her lips pressed into a pained smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t blame you. But, I hope you understand, Katsuki. Love is <em>not</em> what made you sick. You\u2026 you do know that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Did he though? His mother\u2019s voice was hopeful, her eyes patient, offering him time to truly consider her question. Katsuki pouted. Slowly, he allowed himself to sink into his feelings, be overcome with them. He imagined Eijirou\u2019s smile. Every time Katsuki saw that smile, his heart wanted to beat out of his chest. Just remembering Eijirou\u2019s laughter had a way of making his lips want to lift into a soft smile. And Eijirou\u2019s kindness, to him of all people, made his world shine a little brighter.</p>\n<p>Something had to have caused the roses. But it couldn\u2019t have been love. He <em>did</em> know that, deep down. There was no way that something as beautiful as love could have been the root of so much pain.</p>\n<p>Katsuki drew a knee to his chest. \u201cYeah.\u201d His own voice pounded against his eardrums. He let out a shaky breath. \u201cYeah I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mom\u2019s smile widened in relief. She gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Katsuki. And of Kirishima too, of course. Both of you, for working it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, now<em> this</em> was getting out of hand. Before he knew it, his mom was gonna start spewing even cheesier shit, things like \u2018<em>Look at my little boy all grown up</em>\u2019. Or worse, teasings. The hand clutching at her heart, \u2018<em>Ahh, young love</em>\u2019. A pinch of his cheek, \u2018<em>So when\u2019s the wedding?</em>\u2019. Katsuki could imagine it now. He shuddered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWhatever,\u201d he finally grumbled, willing himself to sink lower into the cushions. \u201cJust don\u2019t go around inviting him to family dinners or any of that bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>She let out a sharp laugh. \u201cBut Katsuki! How else will we get to see more of him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh? <em>I\u2019m</em> the one who should be seeing more of him, not you old farts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be seeing more of him a lot sooner than you thought,\u201d his dad\u2019s warm voice suddenly filled the room. He lazily tossed his phone onto a side table and joined them on the couch, taking the spot to Katsuki\u2019s right. \u201cI just got off the phone with Principle Nezu. He said the arrangements are easy to reconsider, and it won\u2019t be a problem for you to stay in Class 1A.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked to him, wide-eyed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, really. And your teachers are happy to offer supplemental training to catch you up to your classmates. Things are looking up.\u201d Dad patted his back. \u201cYou\u2019re in good hands, Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>And just then, something clicked.</p>\n<p>Just a few weeks ago, everything his life had been uncontrollably flipped upside down \u2013 and to make it worse, he had gotten used to it. He had been so complacent in his shitty reality that anything that challenged it just felt like a dream. Even Eijirou coughing up flowers had seemed too good to be true.</p>\n<p>But now, with each reversed shift, what felt like a dream was beginning to feel more and more like reality. Eijirou loved him back. He wasn\u2019t changing classes. He would start training soon. He would catch up. All thanks to the people in his life banding together, supporting him, and he didn\u2019t understand why. And yet, it was real. All of it was real.</p>\n<p>Usually when Katsuki cried, it was because he was angry, or frustrated, or hopeless. But, as the overwhelming relief finally cut its way into reality, as it sank into his skin and into his <em>heart</em>, he felt his eyes dampening.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhh, Katsuki,\u201d his mom\u2019s hand rested on his shoulder, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to cry about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking crying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tried holding it back, tried telling himself that it he was <em>happy</em> so it was stupid to cry, but a sharp pain cut into the joy. Why did they care so much? He didn\u2019t deserve this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026\u201d His body shook. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking get over that this is happening. That it\u2019s over. That someone out there \u2013 that <em>Eijirou</em> \u2013 that he actually\u2026 And, you guys, it doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense, <em>why</em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice was hoarse, ragged, and the rest of the sentence would not come out. He let out a groan and hunched over, resting his elbows on his knees, face in his hands. It took all of his might to stop his body from shaking. He didn\u2019t deserve any of this.</p>\n<p>Why wouldn\u2019t they hate him as much as he hated himself?</p>\n<p>His mom wound her arms around his torso gently, rested her chin on his shoulder. \u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cCome here,\u201d his dad grunted, kneeling on the couch and slowly guiding Katsuki into his chest. \u201cWe love you, so much. We\u2019re here for you. And yet, you always pull away. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Katsuki choked out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I know why, Katsuki,\u201d his mom\u2019s voice was heavy. \u201cI know why, and it breaks my heart. So, let me ask one more question.\u201d</p>\n<p>The arms around his waist hugged even tighter. His mom let out a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki\u2026 What\u2019s got you convinced that you are unworthy of love?\u201d</p>\n<p>Upon his return to school, Katsuki was immediately sent to Recovery Girl\u2019s room. She listened closely to his breathing, his heartbeat, the cold metal of her stethoscope sending shivers up and down his spine. A part of him almost expected the check-up to go wrong. Almost expected her to tell him that there had been some sort of mistake. That it wasn\u2019t over.</p>\n<p>But of course, she said no such thing.</p>\n<p>After lunch, he was finally permitted to return to class. His parents had assured him that Aizawa would tell the class of his return, but not any specifics about his condition. There were murmurs from his peers when he entered the classroom. Then, Eijirou shouted his name and bounded up to him, taking Katuski\u2019s hands in his own and welcoming him back with a cheery smile.</p>\n<p>Even though Katsuki had already mentally prepared himself for such a welcome, composing himself was still nearly impossible. He let it happen anyways, because it was Eijirou.</p>\n<p>But what Katsuki wasn\u2019t expecting, was for the other students to join in.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the entire class, and it would have been even weirder if it was. But several of them circled around him, all talking over each other about how good it was to have him back.</p>\n<p>Racoon-Eyes \u2013 <em>Ashido</em>, Katsuki reminded himself \u2013 said she was happy he was feeling better. The one with the cakes \u2013 <em>What was his name?</em> <em>Satou?</em> \u2013 offered him some sort of a home-baked miniature spiced loaf. Sero gave his back a big pat. Kaminari threw an arm around his shoulders and cracked some sort of a joke, and everyone laughed. Including Katsuki.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t even realized how much like a family this class was to him.</p>\n<p>Then the door slid open and Aizawa entered the room, his hair floating this way and that and his eyes glowing red, and everyone promptly returned to their seats.</p>\n<p>As he crossed the room to his desk, Katsuki glanced to the back of the room \u2013 meeting mismatched eyes. Todoroki gave him a curt nod. Katsuki nodded back. He took his seat.</p>\n<p>Aizawa briefly acknowledged his return, and then class was underway. And slowly, with each day that passed, everything was returning to normal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well. Almost everything.</p>\n<p>Katsuki and Eijirou were knocking out some algebra homework in his dorm a few nights later, when\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go on a date sometime,\u201d Eijirou dropped like a bomb.</p>\n<p>Katsuki choked on the water he was drinking, almost spewing it across the desk. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Eijirou\u2019s laughter was explosive, deep from his gut. \u201cIt\u2019s just, well. We\u2019re\u2026 dating, right? Or. Yikes, maybe I shouldn\u2019t just assume something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you\u2026 want us to be dating?\u201d Katsuki started, slowly, as if he was scared that any sudden loud noises would ruin everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell yeah!\u201d Eijirou bulldozed through. \u201cI mean I won\u2019t force it, but if you want us to be, then\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo whatever,\u201d Katsuki mumbled. \u201cWe already know how we stand, feelings-wise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>yeah</em>, but, confessions are only half of it, the rest is a grey area! With dating, there\u2019s more to it. Like, going out. And kissing. And\u2026 well\u2026\u201d Eijirou trailed off. He gave a little shrug. \u201cRight, Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hearing Eijirou say his name like that\u2026 it made Katsuki feel really happy. Not that he would admit it. He turned to hide his blush. God, he was not used to any of this.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut hey, I think I understand.\u201d Eijirou\u2019s smile was warm. He placed his hand over Katsuki\u2019s. \u201cThis past week has been a lot to take it, huh? For both of us, but especially for you. There\u2019s a lot of stuff for us to navigate. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. And I know you don\u2019t, either. You\u2019ll be sure to tell me if I\u2019m making you feel uncomfortable, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you said, we know how we feel, so, there\u2019s no rush. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe, for right now, a grey area is good enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rubbed his thumb in slow circles on Eijirou\u2019s hand. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man\u2026 I can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s fate or something,\u201d Eijirou continued, an air of whimsy coloring his voice. \u201cI did a lot of research on Hanahaki last night because, hey, I gotta know what\u2019s going on, ya know? And, do you know how weird our situation is? The worldwide prevalence is like, a fraction of a fraction of a percent. And yet, we both got it. What are the chances of that?\u201d He clicked his pen. \u201cFate. It\u2019s gotta be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, no kidding,\u201d Katsuki muttered, but honestly, he wasn\u2019t convinced.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl had admitted herself that the disorder did not develop randomly. There were contributing factors, increased likelihoods. And then, there was Todoroki. A third person in a very, very small sample. There were pieces that wanted to fit together, but Katsuki didn\u2019t know how to get the edges to line up. And unless he figured it out, none of this was making any sense.</p>\n<p>Maybe Eijirou noticed the frustration on his face, for he murmured, \u201cHey. Everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, yeah, I\u2019m fucking fine,\u201d Katsuki sighed. \u201cI just, am finding it really fucking difficult to take this all in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you mean. I\u2019m still in a little shock too. I thought there was no way the feeling was mutual.\u201d</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t what Katsuki had been frustrated about \u2013 Eijirou had no way of knowing what plagued his mind \u2013 but maybe the topic change could work as a sort of distraction, so Katsuki played along.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it took me developing a fucking <em>love disorder</em> to figure it out how I felt,\u201d he snorted. \u201cAnd even then, I denied it for weeks. But, there just came a point where I couldn\u2019t anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, it was Kamino.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked up to Eijirou in surprise. \u201cThat early?\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, Eijirou hummed, his smile crooked from embarrassment. \u201cI mean, I knew I cared about you before then, but I had just figured I had a crush on you or something.\u201d His lips were smiling, but there was a pain behind his eyes. \u201cAnd then you were gone, and I panicked. I had to go after you, get you back, or I would never forgive myself for letting you go. That\u2019s when I realized, there was no way it was just a crush. But, I didn\u2019t know how to tell you about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re just cursed with really fucking poor communication.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, it was Eijirou\u2019s turn to snort. \u201cGuess that should be a top priority of ours from here on out. Really, if it weren\u2019t for Todoroki, none of this would have been possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cTodoroki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! Aizawa told us you were switching classes, and, well\u2026\u201d Eijirou rubbed the nape of his neck, which Katsuki was starting to realize meant he was a little bashful. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it the best. And I think he noticed, so he asked me to replace him as your tutor. It\u2019s thanks to that shove that we\u2019re even here.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Todoroki\u2019s voice echoed around in Katsuki\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>You have a chance, don\u2019t throw that away.</em>\u2019</p>\n<p>So it hadn\u2019t been his mom who asked UA to send Kirishima in Todoroki\u2019s place, after all. It had been\u2026</p>\n<p>Katsuki let out a<em> tch</em>. \u201cThat bastard,\u201d he muttered under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t really nothing. Because the more he thought about Todoroki, and his story, the clearer everything became. A piece of the puzzle had snapped into place. And Katsuki could feel that a few others were not far behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several days later, Katsuki\u2019s hand hovered over Recovery Girl\u2019s door. Something inside of him made him hesitate. With a shake of his head, he wrapped his knuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in, come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>He opened the door. Red hair and a smiley face beamed back at him. Of course.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Bakugou!\u201d Eijirou waved from the cot. \u201cFancy seeing you here!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki froze, and for a moment, he could feel his face betray his surprise. He collected himself quickly, offering a weak smile and a \u2018hey\u2019 before turning his head away. God, he was still fucking awful at this sort of stuff.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl sat on her chair in front of him, pressing her stethoscope against his completely bare chest. \u201cOne moment, Bakugou, I\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d She repositioned the stethoscope a handful of times before removing the earpieces and rolling her chair back. \u201cVery good Kirishima, everything seems in tip-top shape. I think today is probably the last check-up you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWoohoo!\u201d Eijirou hopped to his feet and tugged a t-shirt over his head. \u201cGuess it got itself worked out before I even knew it was there.\u201d He grinned at Katsuki. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all thanks to you, you know!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nearly choked on his spit. His hand flew up to cover his own mouth. \u201cShut up, dumbass,\u201d he muttered between his fingers, \u201cyou can\u2019t just, fucking\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>At this rate, it was as if Eijirou couldn\u2019t physically stop himself from smiling. Even still, his gaze averted and he brought his hand to rub at the nape of his neck, a blush tinting his cheeks. \u201cCome on, Hanahaki twin, no need to be like that!\u201d He hooked his arm around Bakugou\u2019s shoulders and flashed a warm grin. \u201cIn a super weird way, I really should be thanking you. Of course, I should thank Recovery Girl, too!\u201d He turned to her and gave a little bow. \u201cThank you so much for looking after me, ma\u2019am!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d she waved her hand in a <em>shoo</em>ing motion. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd without you doing your job so well, Bakugou and I would be in a lot worse shape!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, <em>fine</em>, that\u2019s quite enough, young man.\u201d Her voice was tinted with exasperation, but under the surface, Katsuki could feel how fond she was of Eijirou. Honestly, he was starting to think that it was impossible for anyone to dislike the guy. \u201cWeren\u2019t you just telling me about an essay you haven\u2019t started?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh right,\u201d Eijirou snapped a finger. \u201cCan\u2019t forget about that. I, uh\u2026\u201d He glanced over at Katsuki and flashed another grin. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he grunted out. God, what was wrong with his voice? \u201cYou too.\u201d</p>\n<p>With casual interest, he watch as Eijirou strode towards the door, hoping that his face didn\u2019t look too longingly after him as the door slid shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cHanahaki twins\u2026\u201d he echoed under his breath, exasperated, because how on earth did Eijirou even come up with shit like that? But still, a smile tugged at his lips.</p>\n<p>Then the words settled uneasily in his stomach. <em>Twins</em>.</p>\n<p>He turned to where Recovery Girl sat at her desk. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know about Todoroki.\u201d</p>\n<p>At first, Recovery Girl didn\u2019t acknowledge him. Just kept typing away, filling in whatever report she was working on.</p>\n<p>Finally, she let out a sigh. \u201cSo. He told you, did he?\u201d</p>\n<p>He lowered himself onto the cot and gave a hum of affirmation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat boy\u2026\u201d She pressed her lips in disapproval. \u201cIt\u2019s dreadful what his father puts him through, what with the surgery and all. Absolutely dreadful. But you didn\u2019t hear that from me,\u201d she swiveled her chair toward him. \u201cTodoroki is still afflicted. And he still wishes to keep it on the down-low, you understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nodded grimly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do hope he is able to fully recovery, as you and Kirishima have.\u201d</p>\n<p>With any other condition, her words would not have been so strange. But, due to the nature of the disorder, her words were layered with meaning. She hoped Todoroki would be cured. That he would find love. And normally, Katsuki wouldn\u2019t give a shit about Todoroki. But he had been affected by Hanahaki long enough to never wish it on even his most heated rivals. And so, some hidden part of him found itself inexplicably agreeing with her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you, Bakugou?\u201d She returned her attention to her computer and pulled up a new form. \u201cIt\u2019s been a week since you returned to UA. You\u2019re healing perfectly, and are well on your way to being completely cured. So, what brings you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCheck-up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The last time he had been called to her office for a check-up had been on Monday. It was Wednesday now, and he had come of his own accord. If Recovery Girl found it strange, she didn\u2019t show it. Only nodded and rolled her chair towards him.</p>\n<p>As she approached, he lifted his shirt up so she could place the stethoscope against his skin. At her instructions, he inhaled and exhaled, knowing perfectly well that no air was catching in his lungs.</p>\n<p>As she pulled the stethoscope away, Recovery Girl spoke. \u201cSomething else is on your mind, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>She had always been an observant woman. Katsuki adjusted his shirt, collecting his thoughts. \u201cI think I\u2019ve worked some things out,\u201d he finally responded. \u201cAbout Hanahaki Disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p>She tilted her head. \u201cAnd what\u2019s what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomehow, three students in the same class have developed it \u2013 and that shouldn\u2019t make any sense. But before, you mentioned that there were factors that could make people more susceptible. You even admitted that UA\u2019s lack of responsibility put students at higher risk.\u201d</p>\n<p>He watched Recovery Girl carefully, but her expression remained unreadable, so he continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we were studying, Todoroki told me something that didn\u2019t even strike me as odd until later. He said that Endeavor knew a couple Pro-Heroes who had this same condition. This same rare condition. So I think about all of this, and I think about what our class has been through that sets us apart from everyone else. And I think I\u2019ve worked it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere really isn\u2019t much known about the condition,\u201d Recovery Girl let in a deep breath. \u201cBut, we do know where it first appeared. There was a war a long time ago, and upon the solder\u2019s return home, many were diagnosed with serious mental disorders. General Anxiety Disorder. Acute Panic Disorder. PTSD. And some, had developed Hanahaki. Today, it develops most often in victims of freak accidents, survivors of natural disasters, Pro-Heroes. There are individual exceptions of course, but every statistical analysis points to the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrauma,\u201d Katsuki finished for her.</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl nodded, her lips pursed bleakly. \u201cHanahaki isn\u2019t just a disorder of unrequited love. It seems to be somehow related to a person\u2019s stress response, found in those who have experienced tremendous trauma. Life-threatening trauma. If you happen to fall in love with someone who shared those experiences with you, especially if they\u2019re the ones who helped you overcome it, then\u2026\u201d She trailed off, allowing Katsuki to finish her thought for her. With a <em>tut</em>, she continued. \u201cThis school has been doing you students rotten, leaving you all susceptible like that, with minimal preventative measures. It\u2019s downright shameful.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sat up a little straighter in her chair, as if realizing the inappropriate nature of her rant. \u201cEven so, Hanahaki Disorder is not guaranteed. An individual\u2019s coping mechanisms, or resilience, might stop the development. It <em>is</em> still rare after all. But, with those conditions met, the likelihood increases tenfold. This isn\u2019t exactly the sort of thing that the hero community wants to be common knowledge, you see. I only wish that UA would do something to better prepare its students for their future reality.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was nice, hearing his suspicions confirmed. Katsuki thought back to the USJ. To the trip to I-Island. To his rescue. Villain attack after villain attack. And through all of that, there was only one person who stayed by his side, every step of the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2026 makes sense,\u201d he conceded. The two of them really had been through so much together. Just like Todoroki had said.</p>\n<p><em>Todoroki.</em> In an instant, his thoughts fixated. He thought of Todoroki\u2019s story. His childhood, his experiences at UA. There had to be some common denominator. If all of this stuff about trauma was true, then for Todoroki, that meant\u2026</p>\n<p>He stood abruptly to his feet. \u201cI think I just figured something else out, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki hated having unpaid debts. And, according to Eijirou, he owed Todoroki. Big time. But Katsuki didn\u2019t seek him out. Todoroki found him first.</p>\n<p>Katsuki was supposed to be chilling with Eijirou and some of the others in the common room. He could tell that those closest to them, like Ashido and Kaminari and Sero and even Jirou, were picking up on the change between the two of them. Katsuki didn\u2019t mind if they knew \u2013 and, more importantly, they didn\u2019t seem to mind either. Eijirou even told him that the class seemed so much happier now that he was back. Katsuki wasn\u2019t sure he believed it, but he could tell that Eijirou did, whole-heartedly.</p>\n<p>It had only been a few minutes since they had congregated on the couches, and the others were already making a ruckus. And maybe Katsuki was having a little fun, too. But there was a flash of red and white from across the room. When Katsuki looked up and the two of them locked eyes, Todoroki gave a tilt of his head. <em>Come with me</em>.</p>\n<p>It was as good an opportunity as he would ever get. Almost immediately, Katsuki was on his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou\u2026?\u201d Eijirou whispered. Katsuki liked it when he called him by his given name, but around their teachers and classmates, they were both a little careful about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust give me a moment,\u201d he answered calmly, eyes trailing where Todoroki turned the corner.</p>\n<p>Eijirou followed his gaze, catching sight of the red and white hair before it disappeared. His mouth shaped into an \u2018o\u2019, and then a smile, and he gave Katsuki a nod. So he understood. That was a relief.</p>\n<p>As he walked, Katsuki stuck his hands in his pant pockets. Up ahead was the corridor that lead to the boy\u2019s communal amenities. This time of night, there was one room that was likely to be empty.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, when Katsuki entered the washer room, Todoroki spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it before, but welcome back.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice was as level as usual, but when Katsuki met his eyes, he could see the intense gaze that Todoroki was observing him with.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo Class 1-A.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki looked to the floor. Dug the toe of his slippers into the linoleum floor. Eventually, he gave a curt nod.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cSo I was right. Kirishima, he\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014That\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf <em>course</em> it isn\u2019t.\u201d There was something petulant in Todoroki\u2019s tone. Something frustrated.</p>\n<p>Katsuki leaned against one of the washers, arms crossed. For a good minute, neither of them said a word. And as each second passed, Katsuki began to realize that he would have to be the one to speak next. Otherwise, nothing more would be said between them.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know how this Icy-Hot bastard responded to thanks. Would he say \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019? Or try to brush it off like it wasn\u2019t a problem? Or maybe he would act oblivious, like he had no idea why he was being thanked in the first place.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Katsuki was about to find out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I should thank you or something,\u201d he grunted.</p>\n<p>Katsuki could say more. He could thank Todoroki for realizing that Eijirou felt the same way even when he couldn\u2019t. He could thank Todoroki for setting up the opportunity for them to work things out. But he didn\u2019t have to. Todoroki knew what he had done.</p>\n<p>He could feel Todoroki\u2019s eyes on him. After a moment, he saw from the corner of his eye Todoroki give a slight nod in acknowledgement. A reaction that was well within what Katsuki had expected of him.</p>\n<p>The words that followed were so soft, Katsuki almost didn\u2019t catch them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Surprised, he looked over to Todoroki. The guy\u2019s eyes were downcast, lost-looking. And Katsuki shouldn\u2019t care. But somehow, he really, really did.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what it feels like.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words were out of his mouth before he could even think, but that was okay. He had to do this. He had a debt to pay.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can recognize it in others, can\u2019t ya? So why not yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki opened his mouth \u2013 to protest? \u2013 but he promptly shut it again. Katsuki used his silence as an invitation.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d his voice was nearly in a growl. \u201cYou know who it is. Deep down, you know. Someone who has been through hell with you, stood by your side through it all, but you\u2019re too fucking scared to admit it to yourself.\u201d He kicked himself off of the washer and reached for the door handle. \u201cYou have a chance.\u201d He swung the door open.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you <em>dare</em> throw it away.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door slammed shut behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the week came and went without much excitement. Both he and Eijirou were permitted to begin training again \u2013 this time, for Katsuki, with supplemental exercises every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday afternoons. Which was a goddamn relief. If the work from that Saturday\u2019s exercise was anything to go by, he was sure to catch up in no time. Hell, by the end of the semester, he was sure to gain an edge!</p>\n<p>Although, the lesson had left Katsuki exhausted, so that evening, he worked on his homework alone in his dorm room. He had just finished up an assignment on the Silver Age of heroes, when there was a knock on the door.</p>\n<p>Katsuki set down his work and went to open the door. His eyebrows raised practically to his hairline.</p>\n<p>It was Eijirou, dressed to the nines in a pair of nice slacks and a button-up. The ensemble was brought together by a god-awful patterned tie.</p>\n<p>He smiled tensely. Nervously. \u201cHey Bakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Katsuki</em>,\u201d he corrected tersely, and it would have probably sounded a little intimidating if only his mouth would quit smiling. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Katsuki. It\u2019s just\u2026 Oh man, I know it\u2019s sappy. And I know that sappy isn\u2019t really your thing. But Todoroki was just so manly today,, and it really inspired me to do the same, so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Woah, woah, wait, hold the fuck up,\u201d with a wave of his hand, Eijirou paused. \u201c\u2026 Todoroki?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Hear what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe asked out Midoriya today!\u201d</p>\n<p>And Katsuki tried to hide his shocked expression, he really did. It wasn\u2019t that it was fucking <em>Deku</em> \u2013 he\u2019d had his suspicions ever since his talk with Recovery Girl. It wasn\u2019t even that Todoroki figured it out. No, what surprised him most was that Todoroki actually went and did something about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI heard it from Uraraka, she was sitting next to them when it happened. \u00a0It was totally out of the blue, right in the middle of lunch, like the first official date in the class was <em>no big deal</em>. She doesn\u2019t even think Midoriya realized what was happening at first, he was fine one moment and then beet-red the next, can you imagine? And then he told Midoriya this thing, about not wanting to throw away his chance, and I remembered what Crimson Riot said about living life without regrets. And it made me realize a few things.\u201d Eijirou caught a breath. \u201cAbout us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinked. \u201cYeah\u2026? What about us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that we talked, and that we sort of agreed to go with the flow. But also, I feel like Hanahaki took away from us the sorts of things that teenagers look forward to. And, I don\u2019t want us to take our feelings for granted and end up getting stuck in some weird grey area. I want to do things properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Katsuki stood straighter, for the first time <em>really</em> noticing how Eijirou was dressed. How Eijirou looked like he was hiding something behind his back. \u201cWait, what do you have\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d Eijirou bowed, holding his hidden gift out in front of him for Katsuki to finally see. \u201cI love you so, so much. Please go out with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>And god, did that make him feel things, how could he reject that? The \u2018Fucking whatever\u2019 had almost passed his lips, when Katsuki caught sight of the gift.</p>\n<p>A single red rose.</p>\n<p>As if on instinct, his hand flew up to cover his airways. His palm muffled a sharp \u201c<em>Fuck </em>no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou\u2019s shoulders tensed. Slowly, he lifted his head. \u201c\u2026What\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell, Eijirou, a <em>rose</em>? Seriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Oh my god. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI might actually throw up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly fucking shit. I\u2019m a dumbass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t appreciate the sentiment,\u201d Katsuki waved his hand, nearly theatrically, \u201cyou just better not bring it on our date tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, Eijirou looked up, hope in his eyes. Then his lips broke into a wide smile. \u201cI won\u2019t, Katsuki, I swear!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood!\u201d Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but smile back. This was fucking <em>absurd</em>. \u201cYou have 10 minutes to get it out of my vicinity. If I smell so much as a <em>whiff </em>by the time I\u2019m done getting ready, I\u2019ll find it and blow it up myself!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou gave a thumbs-up. \u201cYou can count on me, Katsuki!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI better be able to!\u201d With that, Katsuki slammed the door shut.</p>\n<p>\u2026 And then proceeded to bury his blazing cheeks in his hands.</p>\n<p>God. <em>Fuck</em>. Fucking hell, Eijirou was so fucking ridiculous, and it did fucking ridiculous things to his head and his heart and his <em>everything</em> and he never wanted Eijirou to stop. He wanted Eijirou to\u00a0be fucking ridiculous. All the goddamn time.</p>\n<p>Honestly, with this past week helping him wrap his head around the idea, a date with Eijirou didn\u2019t sound like such a bad idea. It was such short notice, there was no way they\u2019d be allowed to leave campus. But <em>hell</em>, if Eijirou wanted to dress up all fancy just to eat pizza rolls and sabotage each other in fucking <em>Mario Kart</em>, then that\u2019s what they\u2019d fucking do.</p>\n<p>But, the flower did have to go.</p>\n<p>Katsuki was really fucking sick of the smell of flowers.</p>"
