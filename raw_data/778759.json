  "summary": "<p>Stiles is home from Berkeley for the summer, but only because he promised the pack. He'd rather not see Derek, because whatever the thing was that they were doing, they're not doing it anymore, and it sucks. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he doesn't have a choice. The betas tried a magical remedy for Derek's melancholy, and now Stiles has a three-year-old who looks like Derek. Stiles doesn't know how to deal with that, and he <i>definitely</i> doesn't know how to tell the betas he and Derek were secret fuck buddies for a year and a half.</p>",

  "text": "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t freak out,\u201d Lydia says when he answers the phone, and Stiles already knows it\u2019s going to be one of those days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe even one of those summers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that early, not really, but Stiles just got in from Berkeley at one last night, and he hasn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in years, or that\u2019s how it feels. He\u2019s tired; even opening his eyes hurts. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When she doesn\u2019t respond right away, he knows the answer. \u201cLydia, we talked about this. No magic without the whole pack present.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, excuse me, but you haven\u2019t exactly been present these past few months,\u201d she points out. Which, not fair\u2014Stiles had school, and so what if he chose a week-long drunken haze in Cancun for spring break instead of more sad, claustrophobic Beacon Hills? Stiles works his ass off. He deserved that. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see him, Stiles. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t listen to this. \u201cThe same bitter, angry Broody McBrooderson he\u2019s always been?\u201d He rolls over. \u201cSome things never change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Lydia says, \u201cHe\u2019s miserable,\u201d and she doesn\u2019t sound like she means to other people, and Stiles hates himself a little for the way his stomach twists. \u201cWe had to do something, okay? The spell was supposed to strengthen pack ties, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles sits up and rubs the sleep out of his eyes, glances at the clock. Quarter past seven. \u201cLet me guess: it didn\u2019t work as intended.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe really need you here,\u201d Lydia tells him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God damn it. Even now, Stiles can\u2019t say no. He sighs. \u201cGive me half an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once upon a time when Stiles came back from a four-month absence and walked into Derek\u2019s house, he got puppy piled. Erica, Boyd, Isaac, Jackson, Lydia\u2014the house is enormous and there are plenty of guest rooms to go around, though Stiles has never used them himself, and werewolves and their pet humans tend to be tactile. They\u2019re all here today\u2014Stiles was the last to finish exams\u2014but there\u2019s a conspicuous absence of hugs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead there\u2019s a baby.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the f\u2014\u201d Stiles starts, but one look from Lydia and he cuts himself off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fairness, it\u2019s not actually a baby. It\u2019s more toddler-sized, with a sloppy black ponytail and brown eyes, and it\u2019s holding a stuffed wolf and screaming its head off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or it is, until Stiles shuts the door behind him, and then it\u2014she\u2014sniffs the air, wipes her face on the wolf, and says, \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you all so much right now,\u201d Stiles tells them. This is his life now, with mysterious magical children popping up unexpectedly. But it\u2019s not like he can just let her cry, so he squats down to the floor and says, \u201cHi, pumpkin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s where he is, sitting on the floor in the middle of Derek\u2019s living room with a sniffling kid on his lap, when Derek appears at the top of the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By design, Stiles hasn\u2019t seen him in four months, and he could happily have gone another four. Because it <em>hurts</em>, looking at him now, seeing the shadows under his eyes, the gray cast to his skin, the way his nails lengthen where he\u2019s gripping the banister. Derek never loses control like that, except apparently when Stiles shows up unexpected.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t exactly feeling the most in control right now himself, but he doesn\u2019t have a dangerous alter-ego.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone had better explain what\u2019s going on,\u201d Derek says tersely before stalking out of the room to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles looks at the rest of the pack. \u201cYou guys know I hate to agree with Derek. But.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know this would happen,\u201d Jackson protests, and Stiles rolls his eyes, because <em>obviously</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe thought it didn\u2019t work at all,\u201d Erica says with a shrug. She\u2019s staring at him intently, though, and Stiles can see her nostrils flaring like she\u2019s playing What\u2019s That Smell. \u201cThen we woke up this morning and there she was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like magic,\u201d Stiles says very pointedly, and suddenly nobody wants to look at him. Great. He was planning on avoiding them this summer, on maybe finally making up with Scott, but it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen now. Not for a while at least. He sighs. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sweetheart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTori,\u201d she tells him, and Stiles has to fight the urge to clench his fists, because nobody in this room knows it, but that was his mother\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek knows, of course, but Derek knows more about him than maybe anyone should.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Tori,\u201d Stiles says past the lump in his throat, \u201chow about we go out for breakfast, huh? You like pancakes, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPancakes!\u201d Tori affirms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But before Stiles can make good his escape, Derek comes back in with two cups of coffee, one of which he hands to Stiles without comment. He can\u2019t seem to keep his eyes off Tori, though, and Stiles wonders what it\u2019s costing him, seeing a kid in this house again, a house that hasn\u2019t seen children in more than a decade. Derek\u2019s looking at her like he\u2019s <em>starving</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha,\u201d Tori says happily, and she climbs out of Stiles\u2019s lap and latches on to Derek\u2019s shin instead. \u201cPancakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t need werewolf senses to know Erica and Lydia just melted. He counts himself lucky that so far no one\u2019s been sharp enough to see his heart breaking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s better not to go out anyway, he tells himself. If his father sees him around town with a kid who calls him Daddy, there are going to be questions. His dad may be hip to the whole werewolf thing now, but somehow Stiles thinks this warrants a special heads-up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Especially since the kid is named after his mom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them,\u201d Lydia volunteers at last, breaking the tension. \u201cStiles, you can set the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even now, sometimes Stiles has to thank God for Lydia.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with me\u201d is the first thing Lydia says when Stiles joins her in the kitchen. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He just nods and starts taking down the plates. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s never set the table for pack breakfast before; he could do it in his sleep. Stiles could berate her for this\u2014could cheerfully wring her neck\u2014but she wouldn\u2019t have resorted to magic in the first place if she weren\u2019t desperate. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They hear the patio door sliding, and when Stiles looks out the window the pack has moved into the yard, Tori held safely in Derek\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia gets the milk out and starts whisking to cover their conversation. \u201cI know you know what\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles lies to cover his guilt. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with him. Same old Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia purses her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He was getting better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe. But not as better as he could have been. Not good enough to trust Stiles, not good enough to tell him anything. \u201cI\u2019ll get the orange juice from the basement,\u201d he says, and that\u2019s that. Conversation over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia makes Tori Mickey Mouse-shaped pancakes, which Tori eats with her hands, dipping the ears in syrup. She can\u2019t reach the table and there\u2019s no booster seat, so she spends breakfast in Stiles\u2019s lap while he eats one-handed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek stares at them and barely touches his plate, but no one says anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles breaks the silence at last, when Erica and Jackson are cleaning up the dishes. \u201cI guess I should go shopping. And I probably need a book. Or a lobotomy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should tell your dad,\u201d Derek says, standing abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t want him to. Doesn\u2019t want this, this insane existence where at twenty he suddenly becomes primary caregiver to a three-year-old he\u2019s never met. Doesn\u2019t want Derek to have anything to do with him and his maybe-daughter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or at least he doesn\u2019t want to want those things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, because Derek\u2019s right: he has to tell his dad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t freak out,\u201d Stiles says, and cringes because he can practically hear his father raising his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe last time you opened with that I learned werewolves are real,\u201d Dad says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately true. \u201cThis is a significantly bigger shock, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re calling from the Jeep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, well, his dad has a point. Stiles is sitting in the driveway, and his dad is home, and this probably looks really suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But not as suspicious as it does when Stiles opens the door to the house with a toddler propped awkwardly on one hip and Tori squeals and kicks her feet and says, \u201cGrandpa!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprise?\u201d Stiles says, the opposite of brave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His father covers his face with one hand. \u201cYou should come with a warning label.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo should mysterious magical offspring,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cTrust me, I get it now.\u201d He owes his dad so many apologies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But maybe this is one thing he doesn\u2019t have to apologize for, because his dad doesn\u2019t look angry. \u201cCan I\u2026?\u201d he asks, and he has the same expression Derek wore this morning, all pinched hope and want overlaid with sadness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat okay with you, pumpkin?\u201d Stiles asks, and it must be, because she holds out her arms to be passed over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His dad is a natural with kids, always has been, and Tori\u2019s no exception. Maybe he\u2019s been hanging around with werewolves too long, but the first thing he does when he gets her is put his face close to her neck and breathe her in. It\u2019s the same thing Stiles did, the same thing Tori\u2019s doing to his dad now, only her version involves a lot more nuzzling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDad, this is Tori,\u201d Stiles says a little hoarsely. \u201cTori\u2026 this is my dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGrandpa,\u201d Tori repeats firmly, and yeah, that works too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTori?\u201d His dad\u2019s voice breaks a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles would be lying if he said he weren\u2019t feeling a bit verklempt himself. \u201cThe name was included.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Lydia made Mickey Mouse pancakes,\u201d Tori says brightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEarly talker, huh?\u201d Stiles\u2019s dad says. \u201cWonder where you got that from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t sure that\u2019s necessarily fair\u2014she doesn\u2019t look anything like him and probably isn\u2019t biologically his. But he leaves it be, because they have more than enough crazy going on at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how did this happen?\u201d his father asks when they\u2019ve found an old Disney DVD to pop in for Tori.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMagic, what else.\u201d Stiles scrubs his hands over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was Lydia\u2019s idea, I think. Something to bring the pack closer together. I think it\u2019s been hard for them, splitting up for school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen much of Derek lately,\u201d his dad segues unsubtly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat just means you haven\u2019t had to arrest him in a while,\u201d Stiles mutters, because oh God he does not want to talk about Derek. Definitely not in front of his kid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dad rolls his eyes. \u201cAnd anyway, what do you mean, \u2018them\u2019? It hasn\u2019t been hard for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last four months have been the worst since Mom died, but Stiles can\u2019t tell his dad that, because his dad will push and push until he finds out why. \u201cIt\u2019s different for werewolves,\u201d he says instead of answering. \u201cI think they only did it without me because they knew I\u2019d stop them if they tried to do it when I was here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dad nods. \u201cIs it\u2026 I mean, is she here to stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles wishes he could tell him what he so obviously wants to hear. Instead he says, \u201cLydia\u2019s looking into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because the universe hates Stiles, when he answers the door, Scott is on the other side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that Stiles and Scott aren\u2019t friends anymore. It\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, no, it is. They aren\u2019t friends and haven\u2019t been in months, maybe longer, so Stiles doesn\u2019t know what Scott\u2019s doing here, except obviously he came to gawk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIsaac told me what happened,\u201d he says, holding up his phone as if that explains everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to close the door in his face. \u201cYeah, well, you know how it is. You\u2019re a little late getting back into town and your friends summon a child from another dimension.\u201d Or something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d Dad asks. Fucking perfect timing as always. \u201cWho\u2019s at the door?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then of course Stiles has to invite him in, even though he doesn\u2019t want to talk to Scott. Hasn\u2019t wanted to talk to Scott in four months.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure anymore exactly what happened or how, but he knows it started with Allison, or maybe it started when Stiles dragged Scott into the woods to look for half a dead girl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe it started when Stiles started sleeping with Derek and his best friend didn\u2019t notice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Scott comes in, Tori looks back from her movie with wide eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott takes a step back and Stiles curses, because fuck, of course. Of course this would happen. \u201cUh, Stiles,\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yeah. This is his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour kid\u2019s a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck. \u201cYeah, you know, not really surprised there, just about everyone\u2019s a werewolf these days.\u201d His dad is taken aback, though, at least a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe smells like Derek,\u201d Scott continues, and just, no.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s pack,\u201d Stiles points out, gritting his teeth. \u201cWe just came from there. Of course she smells like Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Scott shakes his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he says adamantly. \u201cI don\u2019t mean she has Derek\u2019s scent on her. I mean she smells similar. To. Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles wasn\u2019t going to think about it. Wasn\u2019t going to think about her pretty dark hair or her skin or her eyes or the way she says \u201cAlpha.\u201d He\u2019s just human, and he doesn\u2019t have to think about why his maybe-daughter doesn\u2019t actually look anything like him if he doesn\u2019t want to, because probably she\u2019s adopted. But Scott ruins fucking everything, as usual.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Dad says after a silence he apparently can\u2019t read well enough to stay out of it. \u201cIf that\u2019s not Derek Hale\u2019s kid\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jesus, Stiles cannot catch a break today. \u201cStop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And to his surprise, they do. \u201cTori, pumpkin. Let Scott show you how to use the headphones, okay?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know much about how werewolf hearing develops, but he knows childhood trauma, and so does Scott.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tori wrinkles her nose. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell like pack,\u201d she says distrustfully, and Scott flinches. But she doesn\u2019t actually try to claw his face off when he puts the headphones over her ears, so that\u2019s something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott joins them in the kitchen after. \u201cWhat the hell, Stiles?\u201d he hisses. \u201cThis is fucked up.\u201d Then he looks at Stiles\u2019s dad. \u201cSorry, Mr. S.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dad waves him off. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s valid. This is fucked up. Stiles. Is there something you\u2019d like to tell us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles grits his teeth and barely curbs the urge to grind the heels of his hands into his eye sockets. \u201cDerek and I aren\u2019t together,\u201d he says firmly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then the reality of it washes over him in a way it hasn\u2019t in four months, and for the first time he acknowledges the truth out loud. \u201cDerek and I aren\u2019t together <em>anymore</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles and his father have a lot in common, and one of those things is that they\u2019re one great love kind of people. Stiles always thought Lydia would be his, but then he realized hers was Jackson, and after a while that was even okay and didn\u2019t hurt. But Derek is a festering wound that scabs over but refuses to heal; it\u2019s always tender and oozing, and it always hurts, <em>has</em> always hurt, even when they were together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first time they slept together, Stiles\u2019s dad was in the hospital with a broken wrist and a concussion after a banshee hunt, and Stiles was two weeks shy of eighteen, edgy and prickly, and needled Derek more than usual until Derek shoved him against his bedroom door and kissed him to shut him up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles wasn\u2019t in love with him, not then, but he was in love with Derek\u2019s mouth, the rasp of stubble across his shoulder, the way their bodies fit together, the way he could <em>forget</em>. The way sex calmed the thing inside of him that wanted to do everything at once. In another life he\u2019d have wanted his first time to be with someone he cared about, to be special, but this is <em>his</em> life, and he\u2019s learned to make do with getting what he needs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He never expected that to mean semiregular sex with Derek Hale, but he never complained about it either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To his credit, Dad doesn\u2019t look surprised, just resigned. He probably thinks the worst, which, in fairness, is probably pretty close to the truth. But Scott\u2019s gone so pale he\u2019s almost green, and he looks dangerously close to losing control. \u201cWhat!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow this already very long day just got longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that.\u201d It comes out in a snarl, and the tone of it takes Stiles by surprise, but then again he\u2019s never been very good at pulling his punches when he\u2019s hurt. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to act surprised, Scott, okay, you have <em>werewolf senses</em>. If you\u2019d been there for me even <em>once</em> when I needed you in that year and a half, you would have known.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott recoils, just like Stiles planned he would, but his dad\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA year and a half?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And because Stiles is a massive fuckup, especially where Derek\u2019s concerned, now he\u2019s hurt his father too, by keeping something this huge from him. But he can only deal with one of these conversations at a time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t <em>trust</em> me with this,\u201d Scott says, almost as much in anger as pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you trusted me, you mean?\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cLike you trusted me with your genius plan with Gerard that got people kidnapped and tortured? Oh wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTortured?\u201d Dad repeats. God, this whole conversation has spun out of Stiles\u2019s control. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott takes a step forward, eyes flashing, but Stiles holds his ground. \u201cI was trying to protect everyone! I had to do something!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, great job, Scott! How many people got hurt or killed because you had to protect someone? Because you couldn\u2019t see past the edges of your own ego?\u201d And that\u2019s not even counting what he did to Derek, but Stiles can\u2019t ever say out loud what that was, because that\u2019s just as much of a betrayal. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to trust Derek, but I was your best friend. You could have trusted <em>me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Scott\u2019s chin crumples and he looks away, and Stiles just feels <em>tired</em>. It\u2019s exhausting, his whole existence, it\u2019s too much, and he has to let this go or it\u2019s going to eat him alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was there for you, with Allison, okay? I was there for you and you <em>owed</em> me, and believe me, I wanted to tell you. But you never\u2014you hate him <em>so much</em>. You made it impossible. Every time I tried, every time I even said his name, you shut me down. <em>You</em> made me choose, Scott, so you don\u2019t get to be angry I didn\u2019t choose you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s it, finally: sixteen years of friendship, the past four filled with hurt after hurt, and now it\u2019s over. Stiles can never unsay any of it, and he doesn\u2019t want to. Derek broke his heart and Stiles picked him anyway. Would do it again. \u201cYou should probably go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He does, and some piece of Stiles goes with him, something he\u2019ll never get back. Stiles wants to crawl into bed and pull the covers over his face and not come out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His dad puts a hesitant hand on his shoulder and says, \u201cLet me pour you a drink,\u201d and that will have to be good enough for now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was never very often or expected and never more than what it was, comfort, something to cling to when the world went to shit, a way to be less alone when Isaac and Scott were out together, when Stiles\u2019s dad got injured on the job, when someone was in the hospital or clung to life by their fingernails. When the anniversary of the fire passed, or of Stiles\u2019s mother\u2019s death, or when the chaos in his head got too loud.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek always knew.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t pinpoint the moment it became something else for him, something beyond what they needed, but he thinks, maybe, that first Christmas he was home from college, and he didn\u2019t get in until late, and Derek came in his bedroom window and it felt like <em>I missed you</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At that point, he didn\u2019t know what to do. Stiles has always been good with words as long as they don\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tori gets bored of her movie and climbs into Stiles\u2019s lap before he finishes, and the way she fits there scares the shit out of him. Somehow in the past few hours Stiles has become Daddy to Derek\u2019s <em>werewolf baby</em>, and he doesn\u2019t hate it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, he wants it so bad his jaw aches from clenching.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d she says, \u201cyou smell sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Parenting a werewolf is going to be tougher than he thought. \u201cHow could I be sad when I have you?\u201d Stiles says, and he doesn\u2019t quite choke on the words, but it\u2019s close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He never does go back to Derek\u2019s that night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After dinner, he picks up his cell phone (seventeen new calls) and hits speed dial three for Lydia.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should really bump her up to number two.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying at my dad\u2019s tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cBack tomorrow morning. Sorry, I know you guys probably set up a nursery while we were gone and everything. Just, Tori\u2019s already asleep\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding Derek,\u201d Lydia offers. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding him and you didn\u2019t come home for spring break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I will continue avoiding him and this conversation until I\u2019ve had a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d he tells her. Then he hangs up and turns off the phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He dresses Tori in one of his old T-shirts as pajamas, shares his toothbrush, washes her hands and face, and snuggles them both into bed before it\u2019s even eight o\u2019clock. Scott was right\u2014she does smell like Derek, even to a human nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles falls asleep with salt water drying on his cheeks\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>and wakes up some time later, in the dark, with the window open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOld habits die hard,\u201d Stiles says, rough with sleep, and he regrets it already, but he scoots backward, pulling Tori with him against his chest. Making room. \u201cCome to bed, Big Bad, I can\u2019t sleep with you watching me.\u201d Which is a lie, but Derek doesn\u2019t call him on it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can practically taste the tortured silence, because he knows Derek knows what offering this costs Stiles, but it doesn\u2019t matter and never has. Derek can\u2019t help needing this any more than Stiles can help giving it to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It only lasts a few seconds, and then the bed dips as Derek climbs in, curling his body around Tori\u2019s so they form a protective bracket. \u201cSorry I woke you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not going to be a regular thing,\u201d Stiles says, and that\u2019s a lie too, because he\u2019ll never be cruel enough to deny Derek the chance to know family again, in whatever temporary capacity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek makes a sound, something Stiles can\u2019t analyze with his brain still mostly asleep. He closes his eyes. He can finish regretting his life choices in the morning, when Derek is gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only because the universe is a cruel mistress, Derek isn\u2019t gone in the morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, he\u2019s asleep in Stiles\u2019s childhood bedroom with a three-year-old on his chest, the blankets shoved down past his bare feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a year and a half, Stiles never once woke up to Derek in his bed, not even in the middle of the night. It\u2019s patently unfair that this is happening to him now, when he can\u2019t have it anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silently, he gets up and drags himself downstairs to the kitchen, where his father, currently far and away Stiles\u2019s favorite person, is making coffee. He doesn\u2019t even say anything until halfway through the second cup, when they both hear movement upstairs of the decidedly non-toddler variety.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t freak out,\u201d Stiles says again, manfully resisting the urge to bang his head on the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which is when Derek comes in with Tori propped on his hip. She\u2019s dressed in an adorable new outfit of baby-size jeans, a black T-shirt with a pink puppy dog on it, and a miniature leather jacket. He must have brought the clothes with him last night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s father says, \u201cGood morning, Derek. Morning, Tori,\u201d like this happens every day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles loves his dad, like, so much. \u201cDude, cute outfit, but I think it might be a little warm for leather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Derek says after a beat. Apparently they\u2019re all playing the this-is-totally-normal game today. But he flushes as he sets Tori down, and that does all sorts of terrible things to Stiles. Derek should never flush. \u201cThe jacket was Erica\u2019s idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Erica is a terrible fashion enabler. \u201cShe\u2019s going to grow out of that before it\u2019s even cool enough to need it,\u201d Stiles tells him, and then has a moment of extreme cognitive dissonance because <em>oh God he\u2019s a parent</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His father\u2019s expression tells him this isn\u2019t lost on him either, but he just turns to Derek and says, \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Derek says politely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like they\u2019re living in the twilight zone. Stiles is pretty sure this cannot be his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No matter how desperately he wants it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow they manage to get through breakfast like that: Froot Loops for Tori, yogurt and fruit for Stiles\u2019s dad, peanut butter toast for Stiles. Derek sticks his head in the fridge, pulls out a tray of eggs, cracks three in a glass, and drinks them, which is <em>disgusting</em>, but hey, alpha werewolf metabolism; needs must.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have frying pans,\u201d Stiles points out, but his protest falls on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek just says, \u201cI thought I\u2019d take Tori to work with me today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at him. This is probably his fault. Two years ago, he pointed out that Derek really needed a job. Not because of money\u2014Derek has plenty of that\u2014but because it humanizes him, makes him less likely to be the target of vicious suburban gossip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or, well, that was the original idea, anyway. It didn\u2019t work out as planned, mostly because after much huffing and puffing (seriously, the Big Bad nickname is so appropriate), Derek finally took Stiles\u2019s suggestion and became Beacon Hills\u2019 premier dog walker slash obedience trainer, and suburban housewives love gossip almost as much as they love seeing Derek in track pants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be fair, at least some of the suburban househusbands are equally in love with Derek\u2019s ass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect Tori to keep up while you run for two hours,\u201d Stiles says. That\u2019s insane, even if she is a baby werewolf.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI bought a jogging stroller.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles has a moment of affinity for the housewives. Derek\u2019s going to show up on their doorsteps this morning for a run with a baby in a stroller. He will competently call the dogs to heel\u2014treats and leashes are tools for lesser beings; Derek has <em>natural talent</em>\u2014nod at their owners from the sidewalk, and then disappear into the misty California morning. Stiles wonders what Derek has done to the divorce rate of Beacon Hills dog owners.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least this will give him some time to discover what Lydia\u2019s found out about the spell she never should\u2019ve done without him. Everyone is treating this like it\u2019s permanent, and everyone is going to get their heart broken. Especially Derek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Especially Stiles, come to that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles agrees, swallowing past the lump in his throat. He bends over and presses a kiss to Tori\u2019s baby-soft cheek. \u201cBe good for your alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tori turns and smacks a sticky Froot Loops kiss on him in return. \u201cI\u2019m always good, Daddy. Can we have mac and cheese for lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure thing, pumpkin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He and his dad watch Derek bundle Tori out the door. Then Stiles pushes his half-eaten breakfast away and puts his face in his hands. He feels like crying, but he can\u2019t, not with Derek and his super hearing just a few steps away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His dad stands and puts a hand on his shoulder, and Stiles shoves down his emotions the way he\u2019s been doing for the past four years and starts clearing the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me you found out something about the spell you used.\u201d Stiles kicks his shoes off and slumps onto the couch. It\u2019s deep and comfortable and sucks him in, and he\u2019d be way too fond of it except now it holds a lot of bittersweet memories he doesn\u2019t need to be thinking about around a pack of mostly-werewolves who don\u2019t know he used to fuck around with their alpha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On first glance Lydia is as composed as ever, but when Stiles looks closer he can see the signs of a sleepless night; there\u2019s a tiny bit of concealer under her right eye that didn\u2019t get rubbed in all the way. \u201cI found out something about the spell we used,\u201d she tells him dutifully with more of a wince than an eye roll, and that\u2019s how Stiles knows it\u2019s going to be bad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says with forced cheer, \u201chow long do we have?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia smooths a perfect strawberry curl behind her ear. \u201cThere was nothing in the original book the spell was in. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d She sighs. \u201cOver the years the name of the spell evolved. It took most of last night to track down\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She must finally take in the look on his face, because she stops and bites her lips. \u201cThe physical effects last until the next full moon. Two weeks,\u201d she adds unnecessarily, because Stiles has had the lunar cycle memorized for years. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating spell, actually. Apparently it can call spirits or swap people\u2019s genders or make them blind in service of the pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles stares at her. They must have done something wrong somewhere. \u201cAnd it thinks what this pack needs most is giving its alpha a kid and then taking it away two weeks later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia looks surprised, and Stiles realizes that she knew\u2014she knew Tori was Derek\u2019s, but she didn\u2019t think he did. Jackson probably filled her in with the whole smell thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis spell is an asshole,\u201d Stiles says feelingly, and doesn\u2019t resist the urge to bring his knees up to his chest and hug them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lydia says. She looks miserable. \u201cThe effects are supposed to last, but there wasn\u2019t any information on the physical effects under the older name. I didn\u2019t know this would happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He rubs both hands over his face. \u201cYou are never allowed to do magic without me again unless it\u2019s an actual matter of life and death. Clear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t even try to fight him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Great. That just leaves them with one problem. \u201cOne of us has to tell Derek,\u201d Stiles says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia puts a hand over her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Stiles is thinking about it, about what it\u2019ll do to him, about how Derek works so hard to appear strong. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d He closes his eyes and thinks of Tori and her request. \u201cBut not until after lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tori falls asleep in her brand-new high chair and faceplants in her macaroni, and even though Stiles knows he\u2019ll probably hate himself for it later, he can\u2019t help but take a picture on his cell phone. Derek wipes down her hands and face with a washcloth, and Stiles sees his opportunity and starts unbuckling her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It has to be done, but the words still feel like betrayal. \u201cIs there somewhere I can put her down for a nap?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the nursery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It hits Stiles right in the chest, and he doesn\u2019t even try to cover up his sharp intake of breath as he lifts Tori from the chair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Upstairs, the middle bedroom smells like fresh paint; the walls are a cheerful mint green instead of their former lackluster beige. The room is big enough for a crib and a child\u2019s bed, each covered in pink-and-green blankets, like an adorable cartoon watermelon threw up on them. There\u2019s a bookshelf on the wall and a toy chest underneath, and the hardwood floor is covered with those interlocking foam puzzle pieces, also in pink and green.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles hates everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek pulls back the quilt and Stiles lays Tori on the bed, and they tuck her in together like they\u2019ve done it a thousand times before. Derek even produces the stuffed wolf from somewhere and presses it into her arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Stiles hears himself say, \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It goes about as well as Stiles thought it would.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the first sentence, Derek doesn\u2019t look at him. That makes it easier, because then Stiles doesn\u2019t have to look at Derek either. He focuses his gaze on the wall behind Derek\u2019s head and tells him, in as few words as possible, what Lydia found out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not fair, and Stiles hates being a part of this. He hates that he\u2019s only had a daughter for a little over a day and the thought of losing her makes him want to die. He hates the blank expression on Derek\u2019s face and the dead look in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hates that when he gets to the end, when he asks if Derek wants him to stay, Derek says no.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles goes home, closes the door quietly behind him, and sits down on the bench to take off his shoes. Then he climbs the stairs to his room, crawls into bed with his clothes on, and shoves his face in a pillow that smells like family.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Curled up as tight as he can, he falls asleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t see Derek the next day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he shows up at the house, Derek\u2019s already gone to work, and Jackson, Isaac, and Tori are watching <em>Blue\u2019s Clues</em> on Derek\u2019s stupidly large TV, bowls of cereal on the coffee table in front of them. It\u2019s like a cross-generation sleepover.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles kind of wishes he\u2019d been invited.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has thirteen days until the spell takes Tori back, and he plans to make them count. He takes her out for a nature walk, then back to Derek\u2019s for lunch. Derek still isn\u2019t there, but Isaac and Jackson volunteer to help Stiles teach Tori soccer, and it\u2019s as good a way as any to pass the time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After, Lydia and Erica help him with bath time. The second-floor bathroom is a flood zone by the time they\u2019re done, and both girls leave the room needing to touch up their hair and makeup, but it\u2019s still nice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s bedroom door is closed when Lydia finishes helping Stiles with his first baby girl ponytail, and when she sees his face, she scoops Tori up under her arms and plants a smacking red lipstick kiss on her cheek. \u201cTell you what, moonshine\u2014I think Uncle Boyd and Aunt Erica should take you out for a Happy Meal. Sound good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t even be mad at her. It\u2019s not like werewolf kids are susceptible to high cholesterol and childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Boyd takes the car seat out of the Camaro and puts it in Erica\u2019s little Saturn, and when they\u2019re gone Lydia holds out her hand for Stiles\u2019s keys. He doesn\u2019t even bother resisting, just hops in the passenger side and lets her have her way with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia takes him out for grown-up burgers and milkshakes, and Stiles suddenly remembers why he was in love with her for eight years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But no matter how good it smells, Stiles can\u2019t make himself touch the food once it\u2019s in front of him. If he thought he was getting out of this without telling Lydia everything, he was clearly mistaken.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia takes a sip of her banana milkshake\u2014gross\u2014then pushes it aside and says, \u201cDo you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no easy way to tell you what you want to know,\u201d Stiles tell her, rubbing at his eye with the heel of one hand. \u201cThere\u2019s the hard way and the impossible way, and they both suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes and picks up a french fry. \u201cYou can start talking, or I can start asking really pointed questions about you and everyone\u2019s favorite sourwolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t call him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That makes her pause in the middle of chewing a fry, a comical expression on her face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Kate said that once</em>. Derek was naked on his back in Stiles\u2019s bed, staring up at the ceiling. <em>When she was looking for Peter</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles went still, because Derek never told him anything, just talked around what he wanted to say in as few words as possible, and Stiles had to work at listening. This time he heard <em>when she was torturing </em>me, but that wasn\u2019t what he wanted to know. <em>Said what?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the space of several heartbeats, Derek didn\u2019t answer. Then: <em>She called me sour</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles didn\u2019t know exactly what to say, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t be using that nickname again, and fuck Kate very much for that, because Stiles was proud of that one. <em>Screw her, you\u2019re awesome and she\u2019s dead</em>. Derek almost twitched into an expression at that, but he cut it off before Stiles could read it. <em>How do you feel about \u2018kitten\u2019 as a substitute?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia snaps her fingers. \u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>. He takes a sip of vanilla milkshake to give himself a second to think of something to say. What comes out is \u201cI broke up with Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s obviously not what Lydia was looking for, but it serves its purpose as a distraction, and to be fair, Stiles sort of needs to talk about it with someone. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he made me choose.\u201d Because after that first year, Stiles was always going to choose Derek. \u201cAnd because it was a long time coming, and he was an asshole, and he deserved it. Also, I told him I slept with Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia looks down at the burger in her hands, the one that\u2019s paused halfway to her mouth, like she might never actually get to eat at this rate. Then she shrugs and takes a bite anyway. She takes her time following up with that, which is probably a cruel trick to get Stiles to elaborate. When he doesn\u2019t, she asks, \u201cWhen did it start, when did it stop, how many times, was it as amazing as I think it was.\u201d She ticks off the questions on her fingers as she asks them. \u201cAnd most importantly, why did it stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles dips a fry in his milkshake. \u201cSenior year, I guess. I mean I always sort of\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have <em>seen</em> Derek Hale, yes,\u201d Lydia supplies with a wry twist of her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nodding, Stiles pops the fry in his mouth. \u201cAnd Christmas was the last time. I don\u2019t know how many times, I didn\u2019t count, and I have no idea how amazing you think it was so I really can\u2019t comment. I\u2019m disappointed in you for the unscientific question.\u201d Which means yes, obviously, because even that first time Derek knew all the right ways to touch him to make him fall apart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia raises one perfectly groomed eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It comes out miserable, because that\u2019s how it feels. \u201cYou know how Derek is about talking. We never talked about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> never talked about it,\u201d Lydia repeats in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yeah, he has to concede the point. \u201cBelieve me, I wanted to, okay, but I didn\u2019t want to bring it up only to find out\u2026.\u201d <em>Only to find out it meant something different to him</em>. \u201cBut then I couldn\u2019t anymore. We both have intimate knowledge of what I\u2019m like when I get attached to someone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd by that I\u2019m assuming you mean you spent a year and a half having the best sex ever with Derek and then broke it off because you recognized how stupidly in love with him you are and couldn\u2019t continue being his late-night booty call because you actually wanted to get on with your life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles pokes moodily at his milkshake. \u201cThat would be an accurate assumption.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lydia sighs and reaches across the table to take his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nods. It\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles hears a tuneful chirping noise\u2014he recognizes the sound as the one that means a text from Jackson; everyone else\u2019s texts are silent. She blinks down at her phone and makes Hale-pack eyebrows at it. Stiles might have thought twice about getting involved if he knew that expression was contagious. \u201cJackson says Derek\u2019s been listening to the Smiths on his iPod for two hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek hates the Smiths,\u201d he says automatically. The past December Stiles was listening to <em>The Very Best of</em> in his room and Derek got a hunted look, said <em>who is this</em>, his mouth turning down at the corners. He turned it off with extreme prejudice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek hasn\u2019t been himself since Christmas,\u201d Lydia tells him, and nothing he can do will douse the terrible spark of hope.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles stays in Tori\u2019s room that night, curled up in her watermelon-themed bed, with Buck the stuffed wolf tucked snugly between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s gone before he wakes up again, which Stiles thinks is pretty ambitious even for a professional dog walker who gets his run in before going to work. Yeah, so Derek is definitely avoiding him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which would be fine. Stiles is a grown-ass man. He can handle it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Tori\u2019s a kid and she needs her alpha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To distract her, Stiles takes her to the library for their kids\u2019 day program and ends up staying to do research, watching from the stacks as she learns the motions to \u201cGoin\u2019 on a Bear Hunt\u201d (he stifles a smile) and shouts aloud the best parts to <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>. Apparently she\u2019s heard that one before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>During craft time, they make little plaster-of-paris casts of their hands, and Stiles can\u2019t help seeing what hers would look like next to one of Derek\u2019s pawprints.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen to the cast at Derek\u2019s, so he takes it to his dad\u2019s place to set.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While Tori naps upstairs, Stiles has yet another heartbreaking conversation in the real-time tragedy that has become his life: he tells his dad Tori can\u2019t stay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere has to be something,\u201d his father says. Stiles hasn\u2019t seen him this stricken in close to ten years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me, we\u2019re looking.\u201d But Stiles\u2019s two hours romancing the card catalog didn\u2019t yield any results Lydia hasn\u2019t already scoured. He\u2019s pretty sure they\u2019re hosed. You can\u2019t make something out of nothing, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His father\u2019s voice breaks when he asks, \u201cSo what happens to her then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll fade away. Like she never existed. Except for the scars, there will be nothing left behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tori wakes up screaming for Derek, and it\u2019s the last straw. Stiles says good-bye to his dad and bundles Tori into the car. Derek has wallowed long enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He expects the house to be silent and empty when he pulls up, and he\u2019s mostly right. Lydia, Jackson, Isaac, Erica, Boyd\u2014their cars are gone and they\u2019re nowhere in sight. But Derek throws open the door to the house before Stiles even has Tori halfway out of the car seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second Stiles pushes Tori into Derek\u2019s arms, she quiets, nosing into the space beneath his chin, her tiny body still trembling with the aftermath of her sobs. Derek looks just as unhappy as she does, like holding her is killing him but he can\u2019t let go either. Stiles knows the feeling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shoves his hands into his pockets and wills Derek to meet his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally he does, but it just makes Stiles feel worse. Derek is the Jedi Grand Master of emotionlessness. And right now he has heartbreak written all over his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gives Stiles a quick nod\u2014<em>we\u2019ll talk later</em>\u2014and turns toward the house.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because Derek warned everyone off or if Lydia told them to stay away or if the rest of the pack is maybe just a little cleverer than Stiles usually gives them credit for, but nobody comes back to the house that night until Tori\u2019s in bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles makes dinner while Tori and Derek do agonizing father-daughter stuff\u2014Stiles wouldn\u2019t swear to it but he\u2019s pretty sure there\u2019s a tea party involved\u2014and then they eat together, with Tori in her brand-new high chair, feeding herself penne with a child-size plastic fork. It\u2019s quiet but not as awkward as it should be, all things considered. After all, Stiles is eating dinner in his ex-friend with benefits\u2019 (or friend ex-with benefits\u2019, maybe; are they still friends?) house with a kid who\u2019s clearly Derek\u2019s but calls Stiles Daddy and whom neither of them knew a week ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After dinner Derek does the dishes and Stiles puts Tori to bed with a chapter of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and then they run out of excuses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s sitting on the couch when Stiles gets downstairs. His head is bowed, his shoulders slumped. He really obviously does not need the verbal smackdown Stiles had planned to lay on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this sucks a lot,\u201d Stiles says as he sits down on the other end of the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek nods, not looking up from his hands, which are folded between his knees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t her fault,\u201d Stiles goes on, because he has to say something to fill the silence. \u201cJust because she\u2019ll be gone in a few days doesn\u2019t mean her emotional well-being isn\u2019t important, okay? She loves you. You need to be there for her.\u201d He pauses, feeling like an asshole, and then says it anyway. \u201c<em>I</em> need you to be there for her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek flinches and tips his head back so he\u2019s looking at the ceiling instead. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI get that it\u2019s hard for you, okay? I\u2019m not asking you to turn into Mr. Mom or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That makes Derek actually look at him with one eyebrow raised. Stiles wonders how much effort it takes to hold it up. It probably requires alpha werewolf strength.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hand to God, Stiles can\u2019t possibly stop the words that escape him next. \u201cYou\u2019re, uh. You\u2019re pretty good with her, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek looks away again. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. She smells like family.\u201d His hands curl into fists. \u201cGiving her up\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to be like his family all over again. Stiles gets it. He just nods and sighs. \u201cAnyway. Do you think\u2014I mean, we could make the best of it. Go on family outings. Take some pictures. Unless it\u2019s too weird? Because of\u2026.\u201d He gestures between them helplessly. God knows it\u2019s hard for him sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can handle it if you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles, but it\u2019s like papering over a hole in a wall. \u201cChallenge accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next ten days are like something out of someone else\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek still works, but instead of his pre-dog-walking run he makes breakfast, sometimes just for the three of them and sometimes for the whole pack. Stiles usually sticks around to clean up after, and Isaac or Jackson or one of the girls takes Tori upstairs to get her dressed. She insists on wearing the leather jacket every day, even though it\u2019s like eighty degrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Derek gets home from work, Stiles grinds his teeth together to remind himself not to stare, because Derek makes \u201cjust ran ten miles\u201d look like \u201cI\u2019m ready for that sex marathon now.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that Stiles has firsthand knowledge that he\u2019s capable of a post-ten-mile-run sex marathon either. Derek hops in the shower, comes out of the bathroom without his shirt on like an asshole, then finally stops throwing Stiles\u2019s terrible life decisions in his face and gets dressed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then they play happy family and Stiles wishes he were a crappier temporary father, because the fact is it\u2019s killing him a little more every day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dad suggests family pictures, and even though Stiles can\u2019t actually imagine ever being able to look at them, he can\u2019t say no, and Derek doesn\u2019t either. The photographer coos over Tori, over Derek, and over their dysfunctional family unit, though of course she doesn\u2019t know how broken it really is. Stiles has gotten very good at pasting on a smile. He almost has himself fooled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He first sees the flyer when they\u2019re checking out at the grocery store; Derek has Tori on his shoulders and he won\u2019t let Stiles pay, so he wanders off to check out the community announcement board. There\u2019s Derek\u2019s ad for dog-walking services, and Lydia\u2019s for bookkeeping, one for personal training. There\u2019s even one for a therapist. But Stiles hardly notices those; somehow he can\u2019t help unpinning <em>this</em> one. He folds it up and puts it in his pocket, where it feels heavier than it should.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the week wears on, they let Tori stay up later and later, until she starts sleeping in until Derek gets home from work. Stiles makes sure he\u2019s there before she wakes up, sometimes finds himself sitting on the floor in her room, watching her sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He guesses he doesn\u2019t have much grounds to call Derek a creeper anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With two days left before the full moon, Lydia meets Stiles on the front porch with an enormous sugary coffee. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like shit,\u201d he replies. \u201cRecycled shit, even. What am I doing, Lydia?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you should have done the first time around.\u201d She sips at her own coffee\u2014black like her twisted, delightful little soul. God, Stiles loves her. \u201cAllison\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at the subject change. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo some guy she met in college,\u201d Lyida continues with a scowl. \u201cThey set the date for three weeks after graduation.\u201d She\u2019s probably pissed Jackson didn\u2019t propose to her first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles hasn\u2019t heard from Allison in ages, not since the disaster that was their senior year. As far as he\u2019s concerned she can die in a fire. \u201cLong engagement,\u201d he says, because he can\u2019t come up with anything else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting out of hunting for good, I guess.\u201d Then she drops the rest of it. \u201cScott found out on Facebook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face, even if he can\u2019t help feeling bad. Just because he and Scott aren\u2019t friends anymore doesn\u2019t mean Stiles wants him to suffer. \u201cHe should be someplace safe tomorrow,\u201d he says at last. Even after all these years, Allison\u2019s still his anchor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad you agree.\u201d And she keeps looking at him pointedly until Stiles sighs and says:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll talk to Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which is how Stiles ends up coming back to the house with a big box of mountain ash and wolfsbane to find Derek and Scott in the living room, Scott on his knees on the floor with his head bent to the side, defeat written in every line of his body, and Derek standing over him with one hand on his head. It\u2019s the opposite of sexual, but it\u2019s still so far outside the realm of anything Stiles expected to see that it takes him aback.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek meets Stiles\u2019s gaze when the door closes behind him, but Scott doesn\u2019t. By now Stiles knows that\u2019s instinct; Scott\u2019s theirs now, part of their pack, and Stiles outranks him. He\u2019ll get over the eye contact thing when he\u2019s feeling a little more human and less vulnerable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d better lock these up,\u201d Stiles says into the sudden awkward, because yeah, they have a kid in the house now, even if it\u2019s only for a few more hours, and this stuff could be dangerous. He stocks up the cupboard in Derek\u2019s creepy werewolf bat cave, which Stiles occasionally refers to as \u201cthe S&amp;M club downstairs,\u201d and then makes his way back to the living room in time to catch the tail end of Derek\u2019s explanation of what\u2019s happening tonight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe basement\u2019s been reinforced. It\u2019s comfortable but secure. Usually we\u2019d run, but I can\u2019t join you tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because Stiles and Derek have Plans. Sad, pathetic, heartbreaking plans that are only going to end in tears, but still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott just nods. Maybe he feels as lost as Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a quiet evening. There\u2019s pizza for dinner, followed by an enormous chocolate cake Erica and Boyd baked together that Tori loves and gets everywhere. Stiles eats a piece, but when it\u2019s gone and he\u2019s looking down at his empty plate, he can\u2019t remember what it tasted like.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After cake, they leave the dishes in the sink. The betas and Scott slip downstairs, Lydia heads out for the evening, and Stiles picks up his illustrated copy of <em>Alice Through the Looking Glass</em> and Buck the stuffed wolf while Derek carries Tori upstairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They give her a bath together first, and then Derek helps her into her <em>Blue\u2019s Clues</em> pajamas before Stiles sweeps her up in a bridal carry and drops her in the middle of Derek\u2019s enormous bed, where she lands with a bounce and a giggle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek climbs in more sedately, and Stiles follows, awkward and unsure. In a year and a half, never once had he touched Derek\u2019s bed. It seems strange to do it now, especially knowing it\u2019ll smell of him afterward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been reading the book out loud for the past week, so they\u2019re almost finished, just four chapters to go, but two are short ones and Stiles never reads chapter twelve because chapter eleven is a better ending. Stiles tucks Tori under his arm and flips open the book, uncomfortably aware of Derek\u2019s gaze on him, intent and a little sad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he even makes it halfway through, Tori\u2019s yawning, snuggling into his side. She falls asleep just after the Red Queen\u2019s riddle, before Stiles can tease her into trying to find an answer, not that he thinks she could; she\u2019s a clever girl but plenty of adults find Carroll\u2019s riddles tricky. He keeps on anyway, long past the time when his voice grows hoarse, and Derek watches him the whole time until <em>and it really </em>was<em> a kitten, after all</em>, and Stiles blinks back tears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Outside, the moon begins to rise. Even Stiles can feel its pull now, some kind of magic side effect of joining a werewolf pack. It makes him want to howl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cYou should stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he wakes up in the morning, he\u2019s alone. No Tori, no Derek, no Buck. He thinks he should\u2019ve been ready for it, but the pain rips through him, leaving him helpless. He can\u2019t get out of bed but he can\u2019t cry either, so for an hour after waking up he just curls into a ball and hugs Derek\u2019s pillow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just started to entertain the idea of getting up, of forcing himself to go home, when the bedroom door opens. Derek stands in the doorway, shoulders hunched. \u201cYou\u2019re still here.\u201d He sounds surprised but not disappointed. Not angry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But underneath the layer of sweat, he looks miserable. Stiles hasn\u2019t seen him look like that in years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014yeah, sorry. I\u2026.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have an excuse. \u201cYou probably want to be alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek huffs, bitterness twisting his lips, and reaches for the hem of his shirt before turning away. \u201cSometimes I think you don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles flinches back, swallows the lump in his throat, and wills himself not to watch the play of muscles in Derek\u2019s back. \u201cFuck you. You don\u2019t exactly make it easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His shoulders sag. God, why are they so good at hurting each other? \u201cYou think it\u2019s easy for <em>me</em>?\u201d It would be better if he snarled, but his restraint cuts deeper than anger. \u201cI haven\u2019t been okay, Stiles. I let Lydia do magic, that\u2019s how not okay I am. So don\u2019t talk to me about easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe you should\u2019ve thought of that before I got tired of being your dirty little secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles knows it\u2019s a mistake the minute the words are out of his mouth. Every line of Derek\u2019s body tenses and he could swear the air in the room crackles. Then Derek whirls on him, eyes flashing red. \u201cThere was nothing dirty about it,\u201d he snarls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles was wrong about the snarling being better. He swallows hard and fights the instinct to crawl back against the headboard. \u201cYeah?\u201d he says, and so fucking what if his voice trembles. He isn\u2019t here to impress anyone. \u201cSure felt like it when you were sneaking in my bedroom window at two in the morning. It felt like it when you made it a point not to touch me in front of anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek glowers at him, but it doesn\u2019t hold its usual weight. \u201cYou were the one who insisted I never mark you. <em>You</em> made sure none of the others could find out. <em>You</em> didn\u2019t want to tell your dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh gee,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes, \u201cI wonder why seventeen-year-old Stiles didn\u2019t want to tell his dad he was playing booty call for a twenty-three-year-old werewolf ex-murder suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek makes a pained face the likes of which Stiles hasn\u2019t seen directed at him since he was sixteen. \u201cIt was never a <em>booty call</em>.\u201d He spits the words like they personally offend him. \u201cIt was never that, Stiles. I would have\u2014I thought you didn\u2019t want\u2026.\u201d He looks anywhere but at Stiles, but Stiles still catches his expression, Insecure Angst Grimace No. 5.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The truth hits him like a Mack truck, leaving him gaping and kind of breathless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek. You are an actual moron.\u201d A desperate hope curls in Stiles\u2019s chest, and he clings to it with both hands, because after losing Tori it feels like all he has. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014did you think I was <em>ashamed</em> of you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek clenches his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh Jesus. Oh God, they\u2019re dumb. Stiles can hear his heart beating a ridiculous staccato. \u201cDerek. I know you\u2019re not exactly Mr. Self-Esteem, okay, I know you well enough to know that. But don\u2019t you see how far you\u2019ve come? You used to be a creepy murder suspect who snuck in my bedroom window at night and you never listened to us when we didn\u2019t want to kill people because they could be innocent. You were a shitty alpha who picked a group of teenage misfits for a pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d Derek mutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles ignores him, because he cannot afford to get distracted. This is important, maybe the most important rant he\u2019s ever delivered in his life. \u201cYou never smiled and people probably crossed the street so they didn\u2019t run into you. Your life\u2014I don\u2019t even want to think about how hard it\u2019s been. You were a mess. But you were the guy who was always there to save my ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough\u2014Stiles can see that much by the way Derek nods, his head still down. He still doesn\u2019t get it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fine. Stiles can do better. He just hopes he\u2019s reading this right. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re somebody people wave at when they see you on the sidewalk. You\u2019re the guy Erica goes to for career advice, the guy who keeps Isaac from falling apart, the alpha we can count on\u2014even if you haven\u2019t ditched the bedroom window habit. You think I\u2019m ashamed of that? Are you nuts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s hands have curled into fists, and Stiles forces himself to sit up straighter so he can grab one. Finally Derek lets him see his eyes, green this time, the same green Stiles fell in love with three years ago. \u201cIf I\u2019d had a clue we were dating I\u2019d have hired a freaking skywriter, Derek.\u201d He pauses to make sure they\u2019re still on the same page, then adds a little hoarsely, \u201cThat\u2019s still on the table, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek lets go of his hand, and for half a second Stiles\u2019s heart sinks. But then Derek pushes him back on the bed and straddles his waist and leans down and kisses him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing like any of their kisses before, too gentle by half, too slow, too deliberate. When Derek pulls away at last he says, \u201cNo skywriting necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cI have a better idea anyway\u201d and pulls off his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t actually mean the <em>sex</em>, he has something specific in mind, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to complain. Two minutes later Derek has him naked with his face and shoulders pressed into the covers, one of Derek\u2019s stupidly warm hands splayed flat between his shoulder blades and the other buried two\u2014oh God, three\u2014fingers deep in his ass. He still feels raw, like the top layer of his skin has been flayed off, like he needs something to hold him together. Needs <em>Derek</em>, because there\u2019s a hole in his life the size of a little girl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And maybe because Stiles has always needed Derek, or Derek has always needed him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek rubs his stubble across she sensitive skin of Stiles\u2019s ass, and that\u2019s about all he can take. \u201cGod, <em>stop</em>,\u201d he grits out, because if Derek keeps going Stiles is going to spontaneously grow werewolf claws and rip the sheets to shreds. It\u2019s so <em>good</em>, the pleasure burning up inside him; another few seconds and he\u2019ll be coming on the sheets\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek stops, but before he can panic Stiles turns over and hauls him up by the shoulders. \u201cYou really need to be inside me, like, four months ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Derek agrees, and he reaches for one of the condoms that scattered all over the bed in the desperate bid for lube.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he can get it open, Stiles catches his arm and shakes his head. \u201cDo we need that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him, probably because they always have, they\u2019ve always been safe. Part of it was because it was normal, and so much of what they had really wasn\u2019t, and Stiles wanted something to cling to. Well, fuck normal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles licks his lips. \u201cJust, I mean, I don\u2019t want the betas thinking you\u2019re\u2014playing favorites or\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek cuts him off with a kiss and knee-walks a little closer. \u201cStiles. Everyone in Beacon Hills knows you\u2019re my favorite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God, Stiles really is an idiot. \u201cExcept me,\u201d he finishes aloud. \u201cWell, me too now.\u201d He cards his fingers through Derek\u2019s stupid hair, reveling in the shudder it earns him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fuck me now, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek freezes with his face pressed into Stiles\u2019s neck. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In their year and a half of sleeping together, Stiles made a lot of rules and most of them were mistakes. They never fucked more than once a week, they always used condoms even though Stiles knew damn well Derek couldn\u2019t give him anything, they never spent the night together, and he never let Derek take him like this, with Stiles on his back baring his neck and belly, vulnerable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, like this,\u201d Stiles says, hooking his ankles around Derek\u2019s thighs. They\u2019re probably rushing things, but fuck it. They need this right now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s shoulders shake a little when he pushes inside, still nosing at Stiles\u2019s jawline. He had his own rules: never in his bed, and neither of them would see anyone else\u2014which Stiles never wanted to do anyway, and why would he? It wasn\u2019t like sex could get any better than it was with Derek. He definitely should\u2019ve figured out this wasn\u2019t casual way sooner\u2014he never did anything that would mark Stiles as his, and they never talked about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re probably never really going to be the talking-about-the-relationship kind, but that might be okay. They have enough of the same hurts anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek pulls back far enough Stiles whines with it, and he arches, inviting the next thrust. It sparks all the way up his spine and back down again to settle in his dick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>God, he needs to get his plan in action, because if he fucks this up again it might actually kill him. The plan is good; the plan says everything his stupid human brain won\u2019t let him actually say out loud during sex, because some things are sacred.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek shoves his face against Stiles\u2019s neck and shuffles his knees a little closer and <em>hello</em>, fireworks; how did Stiles forget how fucking good at sex they are?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so he didn\u2019t forget, but this is a nice reminder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles drags his nails down Derek\u2019s back and finds the courage to give voice to his plan. \u201cGod. Derek. Bite me.\u201d Derek nails his prostate with an absolutely beautiful thrust. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s hips stutter and his face goes slack. \u201cStiles, you know what\u2019ll happen if I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles does know, because the universe cursed him with Scott and Lydia for best friends and the term <em>overshare</em> doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it. He\u2019s never been able to decide if it\u2019s worse to hear about Scott\u2019s sex life or Jackson\u2019s. Jackson would win hands down except that his is Lydia-adjacent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The point is: he knows, and he\u2019s not backing down. \u201cHuman teeth only,\u201d he pants, digging his feet into the mattress for leverage; <em>why is Derek stopping?</em> \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up furry once a month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek flashes red eyes at him and draws his fingers through the hair beneath Stiles\u2019s navel. Stiles groans and wills it to keep traveling downward, but Derek\u2019s always been a fucking tease. \u201cYou\u2019re sort of furry all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, and even if it feels a little like he\u2019s betraying <em>her</em>, he can\u2019t help it. They should have had this stupid talk years ago. \u201cShut up, you like it and I am not letting you wax it off.\u201d Seriously, Derek cannot resist Stiles\u2019s belly fuzz. He probably wants to come in it and let it dry that way, which, actually, yeah, Stiles is totally on board with that. They should get on that immediately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d never,\u201d Derek says, and his tone misses dry by half a mile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re breaking all the rules tonight except the one about seeing other people, and if Stiles is honest that\u2019s the only one he\u2019s never been tempted to break. He tilts his head back on a particularly beautiful stroke and doesn\u2019t miss Derek\u2019s sharp intake of breath against his neck. \u201cStiles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you gonna do it or what?\u201d he asks breathlessly, grinding up to rub his dick against Derek\u2019s stomach. Oh God, Stiles hangs out with werewolves way too much and now he has a marking kink. Whatever. Who doesn\u2019t want to come all over Derek\u2019s body? \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m gonna come any second and I\u2019d really like to do it with your teeth in my\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s rumbling growl vibrates through Stiles\u2019s body, and that would be enough to set him off, but then he also noses down Stiles\u2019s throat and opens his mouth against the skin there with a desperate sound.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For two seconds it\u2019s hot and wet and glorious, and then it\u2019s <em>sharp</em>, it <em>hurts</em>, just enough to make Stiles forget everything else that hurts, and he chokes out half a ragged curse and comes, digging his fingernails into Derek\u2019s shoulders. Above him, Derek shudders, lets out a wounded sound, and then sits back, slicks his hand through Stiles\u2019s come, and jerks off on Stiles\u2019s stomach, his dick, his hole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he runs his fingers through it. Yeah, that\u2019s going to be a thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Stiles catches his breath again, he meets Derek\u2019s eyes. They\u2019re wide, pupils blown, but sad. Maybe wet too, though Stiles won\u2019t call him on it. The world rushes back in before Stiles is ready, and he reaches up to tug Derek back down into the sheets with him. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting out of bed today,\u201d he says fiercely. \u201cAnyone who thinks they\u2019re more important than our grief can suck my dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek laughs, bitter and brittle, and tucks in close to him. He touches the sore spot on Stiles\u2019s neck. \u201cThey really can\u2019t,\u201d he says solemnly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t bother with a comeback.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then life goes on. Stiles gets a job doing clerical work at the station for the summer, which may be nepotism at its finest but at least it\u2019s working in his favor. It\u2019s nice because it means he gets to see his dad more often than he would otherwise, especially since he\u2019s basically moved into Derek\u2019s bedroom and has no intention of moving ever. The way Derek marked him, that\u2019s a pretty clear statement. For a human it\u2019d be an engagement ring, but Derek\u2019s not human and Stiles doesn\u2019t really need that anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott settles in as their lowest-ranking member, and somehow it seems to work with minimal angst on all sides, which is great because there\u2019s enough of that going on in the house.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a week Stiles and Derek stripped the pink-and-green bedding and packed it away in cedar boxes, and Derek locked the door to Tori\u2019s bedroom. But it\u2019s right there, right next to Derek\u2019s, so they walk past it several times a day, and the pain is still fresh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the third Thursday after the full moon Stiles forgets his lunch and runs to the grocery store. Pack shopping is technically one of Scott\u2019s duties now, but he sort of sucks at it, so Stiles isn\u2019t really surprised to run into Derek at the checkout with a basket of eggs and sausage and peanut butter and other things you only get to eat for breakfast without paying for it if you have a supernatural metabolism. Something inside him twinges and he remembers being here with Tori, the way she\u2019d looked perched on Derek\u2019s shoulders with her tiny chubby hands in his hair like she was using it to steer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek must feel the same way, because he doesn\u2019t say anything, just leans his head against Stiles\u2019s in a display of almost-weakness Stiles never thought he\u2019d see, at least not in public.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then his head goes up, and his nostrils flare, and Stiles watches as his eyes track a brown-haired woman coming in through the doors with a stack of fliers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asks as his heart pounds in his chest. That spark inside him that he keeps so quiet is burning, <em>yearning</em> to get out, and he doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHer scent,\u201d Derek says. His voice is raw. \u201cShe smells like\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles watches as she pins the flyer to the bulletin board.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he remembers. With shaking fingers, he reaches into his wallet and withdraws the folded-up piece of paper he put there weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It matches the one she\u2019s just pinned up:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Surrogacy Services.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Holy fuck. Stiles\u2019s throat goes dry. It\u2019s\u2014this is completely insane. He\u2019s too young, he knows he\u2019s too young, and he and Derek are only just starting to know each other this way, but he doesn\u2019t <em>care</em>. The universe is speaking to him. This is as much of a sign as anyone could hope for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is Stiles listening with his heart instead of his brain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to tell her,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout, you know. What to expect when you\u2019re expecting a half werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek nods, but his body language is distant, like he can\u2019t believe this is happening. He turns his body toward Stiles and kisses him right there in the store.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles ends up skipping lunch to stand close to Derek like that, lean into his space, and hope.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s phone goes off on the counter while they\u2019re making dinner that night, the same tone Stiles\u2019s makes when he gets an e-mail, because it\u2019s a new phone and he hasn\u2019t had time to download something silly to replace it. He\u2019s been a space cadet all day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just finished the final layer of eggplant in the lasagna when Scott makes a noise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After that first day with Tori, Stiles really thought they wouldn\u2019t ever be friends again. He picked Derek, even when they weren\u2019t together, and would continue to pick Derek because he didn\u2019t know how to do anything else anymore. But Stiles never counted on Scott joining the pack, never counted on how his bowed head and silences would prey on him, never counted on needing someone he could just be around in the quiet when Tori was gone. Things will never be like they were, but he\u2019s happy to be wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dude, just\u2014we have the same phone, I guess. I opened your e-mail.\u201d Then he shrugs apologetically and holds the phone out to him, screen forward. \u201cYou should probably\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles takes it, aching. The photographer has forwarded the pictures from their session last month, him and Derek and Tori in their impossible dysfunctional family unit. After today he has hope, at least, that they can have something like that again, even if it\u2019ll never be the same. Just because the baby won\u2019t be Tori doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t love it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But looking at the pictures is still too hard right now, and Stiles tries to hand the phone back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott flips to one of Tori clutching Buck and shakes his head. \u201cNo, Stiles. <em>Look</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he zooms in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s asinine, is what it is. It\u2019s a detail that shouldn\u2019t mean anything. For all Stiles knows it\u2019s a cruel trick of the camera.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he stares at it anyway, at the stupid blown-up tag on Buck the stuffed wolf\u2019s furry ass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a9 2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Derek comes in, eyes wild like he can hear Stiles\u2019s heart beating too fast, Scott makes himself scarce.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d the doctor says a year later. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p>"
