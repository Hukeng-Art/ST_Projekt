All Might wasn\u2019t there. Just a bunch of kids standing around gawking at him. Why wasn\u2019t All Might here!?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSEE!\u201d One of the kids suddenly called out. \u201cI told you he would be stupid enough to actually do it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A loud grumble came from the group and sheafs of money changed hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa zipped up his sleeping bag and laid out on the floor of the bus. He gave it twenty minutes before 13 realized the emergency they had been called out for was a prank. That was twenty minutes of uninterrupted sleep while his kids pounded the shit out of the League of Villains.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a shattering of glass and a villain bounced off the hood of the bus. Aizawa cracked open an eye. No one particularly dangerous.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Those kids had it all under control.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Present Mic admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s been so well rested lately. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing! But, he\u2019s never been well rested! Never! I don\u2019t think he ever got more than six hours sleep in a row since high school!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s also his class to consider too,\u201d Midnight added, frowning in thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d All Might asked. \u201cThey seem like good kids from what I can tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe never expelled any of them.\u201d Present Mic clarified. \u201cHasn\u2019t even threatened to expel them. He even let them attend the opening ceremony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s unusual?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t had a single class where he didn\u2019t expel at least one kid on the first day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A long silence fell over the staff room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we may have an imposter here,\u201d Midnight finally declared.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Late last night the infamous vigilante Stain was arrested by local police after being rescued from a tree in Honsu Municipal Park in the hours after midnight. According to sources within the police department, they received an anonymous tip off which led to them finding the vigilante in question hanging from a tree by a bright red ribbon. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Witnesses report that Stain was restrained by several sheets of brightly colored wrapping paper and that his limbs were tied with more bright red ribbons. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Police have not released any details as to how Stain might have gotten into such as situation, but have asked for any witnesses who may have seen the incident take place to come forward. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201c </em>Hey Hands Dude,\u201d Dabi called out, carrying two boxes of pizza into the room. \u201cWhy'd you order a pizza delivered to your secret hideout?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck?\u201d Shigaraki turned from his place in front of the TV. \u201cI didn't order a pizza.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cPizza guy said someone named Shigaraki had placed the order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey guys!\u201d Toga bounded into the room. \u201cHey you ordered pizza Handsy! Awesome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kurogiri followed in Toga\u2019s wake. He took one look at the pizza boxes in Dabi\u2019s hands and let out a sigh that spoke of long years of frustrated suffering. \u201cWhy did you order a pizza delivered to our hideout Shigaraki?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI DIDN\u2019T ORDER THE GODDAMN PIZZAS!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He snatched the boxes from Dabi and flipped open the lid. He was kind of hoping to find a bomb inside, if just to prove he didn\u2019t order the damn things. Instead he found an extra large pepperoni with mushrooms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>\u201cGood Luck with your attack on the Training Camp :)\u201d </b>Was written on the underside of the lid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Toga protested. \u201cI wanted a slice from that one!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sign. It\u2019s bright, yellow, and wasn\u2019t there when they scouted the coordinates for the place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>\u201cWARNING! LANDMINES!\u201d</b> It says it big black letters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a picture too. It shows a stick figure flying through the air in pieces. The stick figure has a bunch of severed hands attached to its body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they may be expecting us,\u201d Dabi suggested.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell of course this was part of the plan!\u201d Bakugou strained against the restraints that held him to the chair. \u201cYou think we didn\u2019t know you planned to kidnap me and take me to your secret base where you keep all your Nomu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d Toga singsonged. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a clue where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou glared. \u201c674 Kammino Ward, Yokohama. The big creepy warehouse next to the old fish packing plant. The only reason I\u2019m still here is so that the pro-heroes have a reason to bust you. We don\u2019t have the licensing to kick your fucking ass otherwise we\u2019d do it ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm,\u201d Spinner interrupted by clearing his throat. He held up a little plastic baggie. \u201cThis was left on the doorstep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inside was a red toothbrush and a paper note that just said, \u201c<b>Bakugou forgot this</b>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya had had his provisional licence for just under a day, and he was already in the hospital. In his defence, he wasn\u2019t the person getting treated. But the little girl clinging to his costume refused to let go no matter how the nurses and doctors tried to coax her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was walking down the street when she ran into my legs,\u201d Midoriya was explaining to the police officer taking his statement. \u201cThen the building blows up. So I grabbed her and immediately fled to a safe location where we waited for first responders to arrive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know where she came from or who her parents might be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gave a half shrug. The other arm was holding onto Eri who flinched and looked away as the nurse tried to take her blood pressure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe said her name was Eri and that she didn\u2019t want to go back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The officer glanced down at Eri, and at the scars covering the arm she was holding out. The look the nurse gave him said the rest. Looks like social services would be getting involved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When all was said and done, Inko Midoriya was an official foster mother to a little girl who seemed to have no presence in any official records. While police and professional heroes poured over the remains of a burned out complex that was rapidly generating more questions than answers.</p>\n<p>The fact that Class A-1 collectively smelled like a structural fire for a week went largely unremarked upon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shigaraki stepped out of the portal and surveyed the group standing before him. All Might wasn\u2019t there. Just a bunch of kids standing around gawking at him. Why wasn\u2019t All Might here!?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYES!\u201d One of the kids suddenly cheered. \u201cAn arch-nemesis, we\u2019re set for life!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> What? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He must have said that out loud because the entire group turned as one to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need an arch-nemesis if you really want to make in this industry dumbshit,\u201d a kid with spiky blonde hair explained. \u00a0\u201cPeaceful times without megalomaniacs running around driving up the crime-rate are bad for the industry. You think All Might would be what he is if he didn\u2019t have All for One driving up his public image?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Confusion is swirling around in his head, and then it turns into anger. \u201cYou dare! I am not some stepping stone to advance your careers! I\u2019m going to kill you all right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent, keep doing that,\u201d another kid cheered. \u201cWe\u2019ll be set before we\u2019re even out of highschool!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou has always believed that if you tried your hardest you could prevail. It would never be as easy as it was for certain other people, but with sufficient effort and perseverance you could overcome the difficulties that pull you down.</p>\n<p>The entrance exam for UA however is also teaching him the value of opportunity.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know who that green haired kid is, but he\u2019s tearing through the testing robots like All Might through a mob of villains. He\u2019s also leaving behind a lot of robots that are badly damaged but not quite out. </p>\n<p>It may not be very heroic to bludgeon wounded enemies to death with a piece of rebar with a concrete chunk on the end, but it\u2019s the only chance he has. His quirk is utterly and completely useless against robots. He\u2019s not even sure if what he\u2019s doing even counts as points. But he\u2019s out of options, and something that might work is better than nothing that won\u2019t. </p>\n<p>How many points does he have? Assuming he\u2019s actually earning any? Twenty? Thirty? He\u2019s lost count. Thirtyish is probably closest to the mark.</p>\n<p>He passed by the shattered remains of the giant robot without a word.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>He can scarcely believe it when he gets the package from UA that delivers the news he was hoping for, but never believed he\u2019d actually get. </p>\n<p>Class 1-A is a name that triggers no alarm bells or subconscious terror. </p>\n<p>That won\u2019t last for long.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHOW COULD YOU GUYS DO THIS TO ME!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky this is all we\u2019re doing Grape-shit,\u201d Bakugou growled. \u201cI still think we should run you down with the bus after the stunt you pulled in the last loop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, but\u2026\u201d Mineta\u2019s eyes darted this way and that as he looked around at his classmates arrayed in front of him. \u201cYou too Kaminari?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari grimaced. \u201cSorry dude. But I\u2019m with them on this one. That was not cool man.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cLook!\u201d Izuku interrupted before Mineta could protest further. \u201cIt\u2019s just General Education. We\u2019re not sentencing you to hard labor in a salt mine. Prove you can behave yourself, and we\u2019ll let you rejoin the class on the next loop. If you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d he added as Mineta opened his mouth again. \u201cAizawa-sensei will have to get involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>That shut him up.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>If you asked Shinsou to describe the experience of being in class 1-A, he would say it was like being in a theater play.</p>\n<p>A weird one.</p>\n<p>And that he was the only one that didn\u2019t have a script. </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t as if they were ostracizing him. They were actually great people, willing to help and accept him into their groups. But he couldn\u2019t help shake the feeling like he was in the middle of a gigantic inside joke, and that he was the only one that wasn\u2019t in on it. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure we should be doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Sero shrugged. \u201cAizawa-sensei was very clear. We can do anything we want for the class project so long as we don\u2019t get arrested.\u201d </p>\n<p>Shinsou raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t get arrested if we don\u2019t get caught.\u201d Kaminari explained. \u201cNow pass me the wire-cutters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Aizawa said from his place at the front of the class. \u201cThey\u2019ve finished totaling up the damages.\u201d He turned around and began writing figures on the board. \u201cIn fifth place we have Asui with just over 5,000,000 yen, in fourth we have Aoyama with 3,500,000 yen, third is Sero with 3,000,000 yen, second is Kouda with 1,500,000, and first place goes to Shinsou with\u2026\u201d he peered closer at the clipboard in his hand. \u201cWho somehow managed to make it through the whole assignment without damaging anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>A round of applause burst from the class. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do it?\u201d someone shouted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hid under a car with a bunch of kids until the screaming stopped.\u201d </p>\n<p>Aizawa checked something on his clipboard and shrugged. \u201cProtecting bystanders. It counts.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are going to jail for this.\u201d Shinsou breathed through his mouth and tried not to panic. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hunt us down and toss us in Tartarus where we\u2019ll never see the light of day again.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShut up and shovel.\u201d Bakugou snarled.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very disconcerting to wake up in a different bed than the one you went to sleep in. Thankfully he recognizes his room at home and the bed he\u2019s lying in is the same one he\u2019s been sleeping on since he was five. It\u2019s a much better alternative than say a roadside ditch, or a cot in a police holding cell.</p>\n<p>The faintly alarming part is that when he went to bed last night, it was in his room at the UA dorms. Had he been drinking or something last night? He doesn\u2019t smell like booze or feel hungover. He does however, feel like he just escaped from being trapped in a cement mixer.</p>\n<p>Thanks to his classmates he knows exactly what that feels like.</p>\n<p>What time is it anyway? He grabs his phone and turns it on. Weird. He thought he\u2019d gotten rid of his old phone when his parents got him a new one to celebrate him getting into UA. According to his phone it is 8:15 in the morning. It is also, according to the date, nearly half a month before the UA entrance exams.</p>\n<p>That can\u2019t be right. </p>\n<p>He fumbles around for his new phone. He can\u2019t find it. When he turns on his computer it shows the same date. The x-ed off boxes on the calendar on his wall corroborate this. He\u2019s not sure what he expects when he looks out the window, but at least everything still looks normal. </p>\n<p>Except that his parents had had that dead lilac bush out front cleared away just after the sports festival at UA. </p>\n<p>\u201cMOM! WHAT DATE IS IT?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJUNE 16TH!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWHAT YEAR?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c2235! WHY?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWEIRD DREAM! THREW ME OFF!\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s panicking now. What the hell is going on? He grabs his phone and flips open the contacts. Of course, none of his classmates are in there, that was all on his new phone. So he dials the first number that comes to mind that he can still remember.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya? Is that you? What the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh? Who is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Midoriya Izuku right? It\u2019s me, Shinsou. From school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho? There\u2019s no Shinsou in my class. How do you know my name?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 sorry, I must have the wrong number.\u201d </p>\n<p>He hangs up and barely suppresses a scream. That was Midoriya, he recognized the voice. But Midoriya hadn\u2019t recognized him. Panic is gnawing at the edges of his mind as he dials the only other number he remembers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYaoyorozu! It\u2019s Shinsou, please tell me you remember me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scream that came out of the phone nearly deafened him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Yaoyorozu sounds nearly as panicked as him. \u201cBut, Shinsou? That\u2019s really you? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to ask you! What\u2019s happening!? The last thing I remember is going to bed in the dorms and when I woke up the next morning I\u2019m back at home, and my phone is saying I\u2019ve gone back in time, and I already called Midoriya and he didn\u2019t recognize me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a time loop!\u201d Yaoyorozu hastily explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve been repeating our first year. But, it\u2019s always been\u2026 you\u2019ve never looped with us before!\u201d </p>\n<p>A time loop. That\u2026 actually explained a lot. The panic began to recede from his brain. \u201cWhat about Midoriya? He had no idea who I was when I called him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all loop back to different points,\u201d Yaoyorozu explained. It sounded like she was calming down too. \u201cMidoriya doesn\u2019t come back until just before the entrance exam. We have some theories as to why that is, but nothing really concrete. Oh god. You said you called him!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah? Sorry, I was freaking out and he was the first number I could remember. Is that going to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no. You\u2019re not going to destroy time or anything like that. Time is apparently a lot more robust that some sci-fi writers gave it credit for. It\u2019s just that\u2026 well\u2026 Midoriya gets kind of weird when he suspects there\u2019s something going on that he\u2019s not aware of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Midoriya stared at his phone in confusion. That had been one weird call. Out of curiosity, he redialled the number. Busy signal. Interesting. </p>\n<p>He reached over and grabbed the black notebook off the nightstand. Notes and papers bulged out of its sides.</p>\n<p>-Got strange call at 8:34 June 16th<br>-Caller knew my full name<br>-Said his name was Shinsou<br>-Seemed to expect me to know who he was<br>-Said something about us being in the same class<br>-Possible connection to what happened to Kacchan?</p>\n<p>He turned on his computer and began searching the name Shinsou across various social media sites. He spared a rueful glance at his overflowing notebook. If this new development panned out he was going to need a better way of organizing his data. That big cork-board that belonged to his dad would work great for that now that he thought about it. </p>\n<p>He wondered if his mom had any red string left.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>He does a lot better in the exams this time. For one, he didn\u2019t follow in Izuku\u2019s wake bludgeoning damaged robots to death with a piece of concrete. His quirk was still worthless against robots of course, but apparently cooperation points were a thing. </p>\n<p>It was also a new feeling to find himself a true part of the group now, instead of just this weird bystander that\u2019s been allowed to observe them. It\u2019s a nice kind of feeling actually.</p>\n<p>Except there\u2019s something wrong. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo Mineta hasn\u2019t looped?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange seeing how sudden the change is from the boy who had been following Shinsou around with a notebook and stalking his social media profiles, to the classmate he remembers from his first loop. </p>\n<p>\u201cQuestion. Who\u2019s Mineta?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe used to be in the loop with us,\u201d Yaoyorozu explained. \u201cHe is-was one of our classmates but he didn\u2019t make it through the practical exam in the last loop and so got shuffled to general education.\u201d </p>\n<p>There\u2019s more to it than that, but Shinsou doesn\u2019t ask. He\u2019s kind of scared to find out. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave I met him before? I don\u2019t even know what he looks like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSmall guy,\u201d Ochako indicated waist height. \u201cGot purple hair that forms into these balls on the top of his head. Kind of a perv too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Him. Shinsou remembers him from from the last loop now that he thinks about it. He was always glaring at Shinsou whenever he saw him and seemed to bear some kind of grudge against him. That made sense now. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, he hasn\u2019t looped yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Izuku rubbed the back of his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t recognize any of us, and he should have looped already.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTried to grab my ass during the exam too,\u201d Jirou hissed. \u201cHe knows better. At least he used to.\u201d </p>\n<p>Now that he thought about it, Shinsou had also seen someone wheeled out of the exam on a stretcher with gauze stuffed in their ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually\u2026 he should have looped back about the same time you did,\u201d Yaoyorozu added. </p>\n<p>Everyone turned to look at Shinsou.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I somehow took his place!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes the most sense,\u201d Iida said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been the entire class. When Mineta wasn\u2019t part of the class anymore he no longer applied.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now that I\u2019m part of the class, it applies to me now too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cIn any case, we should probably make this formal.\u201d He gave Shinsou a smile. \u201cSorry for leaving you in the dark like that. Welcome to Class 1-A.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s starts during the second attack of the sludge villain.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a quick thing. Midoriya is just turning around to follow after All Might when he catches a glimpse of Kacchan out of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>He has this strange expression on his face. It\u2019s not rage, Midoriya knows that face well. It\u2019s, well he\u2019s not sure what it is. Neither, he suspects, does Kacchan.</p>\n<p>Then Kacchan notices he\u2019s watching. Midoriya braces for the anger, except it doesn\u2019t happen. Instead, he gives a small two-fingered salute.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Midoriya knows beyond any doubt that something is horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Kacchan has changed, there\u2019s not doubt about it now. He\u2019s still Kacchan, just Kacchan that acts like he\u2019s on medication for rage problems. </p>\n<p>And he\u2019s not on medication, Midoryia checked. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Deku!\u201d</p>\n<p>The train station is crowded, packed wall to wall with commuters rushing to and from the platforms. Midoryia only barely hears his nickname being called out amongst the noise, but he does, and its enough to have his phone brought up on reflex. He doesn\u2019t even remember snapping the picture, or even seeing the person he was photographing. But when he\u2019s finally free of the crowd he glances down at the picture he\u2019s taken.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a girl waving her hand above the heads of the crowd. Brown hair cut straight, wide brown eyes, a wide smile, and pink pads on the tips of her fingers. </p>\n<p>She\u2019s cute. </p>\n<p>Normally his mind would be overloading just trying to process the idea that a cute girl (or any girl for that matter) would actually know who he is. But there\u2019s a mystery to solve right now. He\u2019s already singled out her face and is running the picture through a image sourcing app on his phone.</p>\n<p>Uraraka Ochako huh?</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a boy waiting outside the school for him. He has this burn scar on side of his face, and hair that\u2019s half white and half red, split right down the middle. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you to remember,\u201d is all he says before turning around and walking in the direction of the train station. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The birds outside his bedroom window spell out \u201cHello.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku is already prowling the internet for people with animal control quirks.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>There\u2019s being stalked, and then there\u2019s being stalked by Midoriya. Despite the fact he\u2019s been following Yaoyorozu for three hours now, writing in his notebook and muttering furiously, he still gives the impression of a stray puppy that\u2019s decided to follow you home. Plus it's hard to feel threatened by someone whom you\u2019ve known for years (Metaphysically) and whom you\u2019ve learned to trust. </p>\n<p>The problem, is that he knows about her in the first place. She has studiously avoided having any contact with Midoriya before he looped back on the day of the entrance exams. He shouldn\u2019t have any reason to follow her at all.</p>\n<p>Except he\u2019s here, holding up a magazine trying to pretend he\u2019s engrossed in reading it as he follows her down the street. She\u2019s not the only one either, Iida, Jirou, Kaminari and Sero have all had Izuku either message them out of the blue or show up at their school or home. Even Aizawa-sensei had Midoriya knock on his apartment door. (He had been in the middle of catching up on his sleep, and so had answered the door with, \u201cWhat do you want this time Midoriya?\u201d)</p>\n<p>She glanced behind her through a reflection in a store window. Midoriya had ditched the magazine and was now typing something into his phone.</p>\n<p>They really needed to stop doing this. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI know this looks crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshinori blinked as he took in the mess of photos and notes pinned to his prodigy's wall. There was a lot of information here, arrayed in a way that brought to mind the digital layouts he had seen Tsukauchi and other members of the police force use when they were try to layout evidence and connect it with suspects and timelines.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat exactly am I looking at my boy?\u201d he asked, his eyes darting this way and that as he tried to piece together what was going on.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s been strange things going on,\u201d Izuku admitted. \u201cJust after you saved me and Kacchan from the Sludge villian, things changed. Kacchan started acting weird, and while he swears there\u2019s nothing wrong. I also started running into people who I had never met, but who seemed to know me, and who kept making weird references to me remembering. I managed to talk to a few of their parents and a few of them admitted that they had also changed suddenly for no apparent reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, Toshinori could see it now. Each node of the chart was devoted to specific people, along with lists detailing who they were, important facts about them, and documenting encounters with young Midoriya. Red string highlighted connections between various people along with facts they had in common. One stand even looped around the entire board in a circle. Apparently they were all around young Midoriya\u2019s age. Interesting. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some theories about what\u2019s going on, but I haven\u2019t been able to verify any of them. \u2026 Look I know this looks crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, he could sort of see how young Midoriya would be worried about giving off that impression. Still, this was an impressive display of investigation. The police would welcome someone like that with open arms. If he hadn\u2019t already chosen the boy to be his successor, he would be pushing him to consider a career in the police. More to the point\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you may actually be on to something here my boy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Kirishima had just looped back. Bakugou was already waiting on his doorstep with a game console and a bag of snacks. They had were just on the seventh round of All Star Melee when the doorbell rang. He opened the door to find Midoriya standing on the front step, clutching a notebook to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a time loop isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re my future classmates at UA and we\u2019re stuck in a time loop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever Kirishima was going to say was drowned out by the sound of Bakugou sucking half a granola bar into his lungs.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, time to find out if this is true or I\u2019m just crazy,\u201d Midoriya looked down at the hair in his hand, the innocuous piece of hair that supposedly give him the chance to achieve his dream, and prove once and for all whether or not the whole time loop thing is an elaborate joke being played on him by Kacchan and a bunch of strangers.</p>\n<p>Toshinori, sitting there off to the side, can\u2019t help but wonder the same thing. It seems insane on the surface, but he\u2019s faced a lot of insane things during his career. Time quirks are certainly nothing new, and time looping is not impossible. </p>\n<p>Not probable, but by no means impossible. The evidence certainly points to it being real. But you can also never discount the possibility of a trick. </p>\n<p>Midoriya swallows the hair, then his face changes. At first it's this blank, kind of shocked look. Like someone had just come up to him and slapped him across the face with a fish. Then comes a look of dawning horror.</p>\n<p>\u201cAHHHHHHHHHGGGGG! I TOLD THEM TO STOP DOING THIS!\u201d</p>\n<p>A tactful person might describe Shoto Todoroki\u2019s relationship with his father as complex. That is to say it was mostly antagonistic with a confusing jumble of familial feelings and expectations mixed in.</p>\n<p>On a calm day, Shoto would say he hated his father, but didn\u2019t want him dead or anything. The problem was, was that when he looped back, it wasn\u2019t on a calm day. It was the day his special admission to into UA went through. His father in response had dragged him out of bed in the early hours of the morning for an extra gruelling training session. </p>\n<p>So he\u2019s never calm when he loops back. In fact he\u2019s practically boiling over with barely suppressed anger and resentment. Sometimes he keeps his cool and avoids making a scene.</p>\n<p>Sometimes.</p>\n<p>Most of the times he lashes back with everything he has picked up during the many, many loops they have gone through. He\u2019s even put his dad into the intensive care ward at the hospital a couple (hundred) times. </p>\n<p>He had actually been doing pretty good these last few loops. The worst he had done was cracked a few ribs. Looking back, that might have been part of the problem. The fact that the last loop hadn\u2019t gone well had also likely contributed.</p>\n<p>In any case he\u2019s already riled up before he even finishes opening his eyes to greet the new loop. It\u2019s like there\u2019s an elastic band stretched inside him that gets tighter and tighter with each grueling exercise his dad puts him through. </p>\n<p>Then they start the sparing, and that elastic band inside of him just snaps. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku probably should be in bed right now. But it's saturday night, his mom is out with her friends, and he honestly has nothing better to do. So that means another late night prowling the hero fanboards and watching videos of hero fights. He\u2019s not expecting the doorbell to ring. His mom isn\u2019t due back for another couple hours and she has a key. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a boy standing on the front step. He\u2019s got a burn scar across half of his face and his hair is split down the middle, half white and half red. Ash and blood are smeared across his clothes and he smells like a campfire. </p>\n<p>\u201cI just killed my dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Bakugou Katsuki is in bed right now. He\u2019s in fact in the middle of a deep sleep when his phone rings. His mind is understandably fuzzy when he grabs his phone off the nightstand and answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cW\u2019thefuck do you want?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan? Hey, it\u2019s Izuku. Do you know someone with red and white hair and a burn scar on their face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Fucking Half\u2019n\u2019half? Yeah, what\u2019about him?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s at my house. He said he just killed his dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWHAT!?\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>The first thing Shoto\u2019s sleepy mind registers is that this is not his bedroom. His father would never have allowed this much All Might merchandise anywhere near his house. There\u2019s also Bakugou standing by the bed, glaring down at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really fucked things up this time Half and Half.\u201d He snarled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on killing\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that!\u201d Bakugou snapped. \u201cWe all figured you\u2019d flip and murder the bastard one day. You just had to fucking go on the run and make Deku\u2019s house the first fucking place you head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is that\u2026\u201d and then it clicked. \u201cThe entrance exam is still a week away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEx-fucking-xactly. I had to tell Deku we were time traveling heroes using a quirk to prevent your dad from becoming a villain and destroying japan. Had to lie to his fucking mom too. She thinks your a friend of Deku\u2019s who\u2019s having family problems.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some bloody clothes to burn,\u201d Bakugou scoffed. \u201cDeku\u2019s out getting you some hair dye and Photocopier said she would be over in a bit with a disguise for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>His hair had been dyed black and styled so that it covered his burn scar. Yaoyorozu had given him new set of clothes that included a hoodie, a leather jacket, and a pair of loose pants, along with a wad of bills she had pulled out of her thigh. He didn\u2019t look like Todoroki Shoto, Endevor\u2019s prodigal son anymore.</p>\n<p>He looked kind of like Dabi actually.</p>\n<p>A large hand clamped down on his shoulder from behind and he turned to catch sight of a grinning face decorated with piercings and cosmetic skin graphs. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey little brother, heard you were in a bit of trouble.\u201d Dabi\u2019s grin was radiating the same kind of smug satisfaction you\u2019d expect to see in a cat that had finally figured out how to open the birdcage. \u201cCongratulations. Wish I had been there to see you crush the Bastard.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>One would have thought sharing an apartment/hideaway with Himiko Toga would involve being stabbed a lot more. He had only been stabbed once since Dabi brought him here, and that had involved a cockroach and his arm being in the way. </p>\n<p>What he also hadn\u2019t expected was the sudden feeling of loneliness. It\u2019s an old familiar feeling, but one he hadn\u2019t really felt since the time loops began. Time looping had brought the class together in a way nothing else really could, and it had driven away the loneliness. He likes and trusts the people of his class like no one else in his life. Only now he\u2019s suddenly apart from them because he decided to crush his dad under a fiery glacier.</p>\n<p>What are they doing right now anyway? It\u2019s been ages since he\u2019s had to wonder that.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment his phone buzzed with a message.</p>\n<p>\u201cYOU KILLED YOUR DAD!?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah yes, it's the entrance exam today.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Aizawa finished up the roll call, dutifully checking off yet another absent for Todoroki before snapping the file closed.</p>\n<p>Having gotten in on special recommendation before the regular entrance exam, Todoroki Shoto was a card-carrying member of class 1-A. The fact he had yet to actually show up for a class and was wanted by the police in connected to his father being crushed under a localized glacier didn\u2019t actually remove his name from the class roster.</p>\n<p>And if Administration had neglected to do that, he wasn\u2019t going to bring it to their attention. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou guys know the drill. Pick a class president, I don\u2019t care how you do it, etcetera etcetera. Wake me when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shuffled out of the class, closing the door behind him.</p>\n<p>Midoriya stood up. \u201cGuys, I think there\u2019s only one person in this class who deserves the honor this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shoto looked up from his tablet. \u201cI\u2019ve been elected class president. My classmates have been sending me everything I need to do the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look Dabi gave him was impossible to describe. At least if you were Shoto. Most people would call it mildly worried. \u201cYou\u2019re on the run from the law, and haven\u2019t shown up for a single day of class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly, they figure I\u2019ll have a lot of time on my hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should have gotten you out of that house years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>One thing Shoto had not expected about being on the run from the law, was how utterly boring it was. He was already starting to get a sense of why exactly his brother and Toga had joined the League of Villains. He had only been hiding out in this apartment for two weeks and already burning the world was looking appealing. </p>\n<p>He had already read all the books in the apartment, including the owners manual for the rice-cooker, had exhausted the capacity of the internet to relieve boredom two hundred loops ago, and was currently amusing himself by testing whether or not it was possible to prevent a pot of water on a stove from boiling through continued observation.</p>\n<p>Toga and Dabi for their part were waging their own fight against boredom by engaging in their 2642th round of high-speed stabscotch on the kitchen table. </p>\n<p>...and it looks like they were finished with that now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what should we do next?\u201d Dabi asked as they bandaged his hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s rob a bank.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>He had been kidding when he suggested it.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Everything was one fire. Someone was screaming about being stabbed. Burst pipes were spraying water everywhere which was not actually helping to put out the fires. </p>\n<p>It had all been going to plan right until Dabi\u2019s piercings had set off a metal detector and Toga had responded by shanking a security guard with a ballpoint pen. </p>\n<p>Shoto created a ramp of ice, shouldered the duffle bag full of money, and ducked out the window sliding to a perfect stop safely on the ground.</p>\n<p>The heroes were already responding. No surprise, they couldn\u2019t possibly have missed the cloud of black smoke coming from the building or the bursts of blue fire that were still erupting from the windows. It took him a while to recognize the hero waiting for him at the bottom of the ramp. Rock Roller was a minor hero with a big ego, a chip on his shoulder, and petty sense of resentment against anyone who looked like they might possibly overshadow him. That apparently included new interns who were just looking for someone to show them the ropes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh you.\u201d He said, his left side flaring with fire. \u201cJust as we planned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>He was being sarcastic when he said it.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess what! We made the news!\u201d </p>\n<p>It was old news to Shoto, his classmates had all sent him messages drawing his attention to the blaring headline which stated that \u201cManiac Teenagers\u201d had burned down a bank in middle of central Korosantu in broad daylight. Not to mention curb stomping said teenagers had delivered to local pro-hero Rock Roller, who had responded to the emergency. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re even saying we might in the same league as Stain,\u201d Toga continued, letting out an excited squeal and hugging the phone to her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in the same league as Stain,\u201d Shoto replied. An idea was forming in his head. \u201cWe can do better than him.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>It was a night of regrets for the the Turbo Hero Ingenium. They ranged in size from big ones, like the fact that he didn\u2019t tell Tenya how proud he was of him, to small ones such as the regret that he never got around to replacing that ugly coffee table in his apartment. All of them however, centered on one key regret.</p>\n<p>That he had gone hunting for Stain alone. </p>\n<p>It had happened so fast, one moment all had been peaceful then suddenly he had been stabbed. He had turned around just in time to catch Stain licking the blood from a knife, and just like that, he couldn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>That had been bad enough. Then someone had called out \u201cHEY! THAT HERO IS OURS!\u201d And he suddenly found himself caught in a battle royale between Stain, a teenage girl with a knife, and an older boy with a flame quirk. Two of the three new villians that had been targeting heroes for the past few weeks.</p>\n<p>All he could do was lie their helpless on the ground while the three of them battled it out. If he could just shake off Stain\u2019s quirk then maybe he had a chance. He couldn\u2019t win this battle, but if he could escape to safety that was a victory in and of itself. At the very least he could provide some information of how Stain was defeating his victims. </p>\n<p>A pair of arms hooked under his arms and began dragging him away from the battle. He couldn\u2019t move his neck, but he was able to flop his head in such a way he could see who was carrying him. </p>\n<p>Hello villain number three. Todoroki Shoto, Endevor\u2019s son, who according to the media had snapped under his father\u2019s overbearing expectations, crushed said father under a miniature glacier that still hasn\u2019t melted, and ran off to become a villain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to kill me now?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo. We only go after assholes. You\u2019re cool.\u201d He propped Tensei up behind a dumpster and began covering him with bags of garbage. \u201cStain\u2019s quirk should wear off in a couple of minutes. Try to stay hidden. Once we take care of Stain, I\u2019ll tell them you got away. Get yourself somewhere safe as soon as we\u2019re clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou planned this.\u201d Tensei gasped. He had to have. The lot of them being in the same place at the same time could be coincidence. But this whole dragging him off and hiding him suggested something planned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki shrugged. \u201cYour little brother would kill me if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Even after all the loops he\u2019s gone through, Shoto has still hasn\u2019t figured out what to think about his mom. Like his dad, his relationship is complicated to say the least. But at least he\u2019s never had the overwhelming urge to crush her with a glacier. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s also never visited his mom with his older brother either.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dyed your hair, both of you.\u201d Their mom is looking between the two of them, probably trying to digest how much they\u2019ve changed since she last saw them. \u201cI like it.\u201d It made them look less like their dad after all. \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening with you two?\u201d</p>\n<p>Right, Mom didn\u2019t watch the news did she. \u201cThey\u2019re going well,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ve been elected class president.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful Shoto. What about you dear?\u201d she asked, turning towards Dabi. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>It was at that moment the door burst open and Toga ran into the room. She had a scalpel in one hand and blood splattered across the nurses uniform she was wearing. </p>\n<p>\u201cI just made a new friend!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry Mom,\u201d Dabi said, getting up from his chair. \u201cWe need to leave now.\u201d</p>\n<p>They bolted for the window as the sounds of police sirens started to become audible.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright you little shithead kid. Who the fuck are you, and what the fuck did you do to our boss?\u201d </p>\n<p>It was hard to tell with the plague doctor mask over his face but Shoto suspects Shin Namoto is extremely pissed off at him. Even more so than he would normally be if he had just discovered Eri was missing and there was some strange teenager trying to sneak out of their secured compound. </p>\n<p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a time traveling hero from the future. We\u2019ve replaced your boss with a shapeshifting teenage serial killer and intend to drive your organization into the ground before my compatriots get bored and decide to wipe you off the map.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of practice.\u201d </p>\n<p>It's hard to read expressions with the plague doctor mask, but Shin has gone quiet. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say, its the truth.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the kind of awkward when a good friend walks in on you when your in the middle of doing something illegal. </p>\n<p>\u201cUmmmmm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>And then there was the kind of awkward when said best friend was also in the middle of something completely unrelated, but equally illegal. </p>\n<p>\u201cVigilantism again Izuku?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gave a nervous laugh and adjusted his grip on the villain her was currently throttling. \u201cArmed robbery Shoto?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt pays the bills,\u201d Shoto shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you if you didn\u2019t see us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds fair,\u201d Izuku replied. He gave the villain one last squeeze, to make sure he was unconscious. \u201cSee you later.\u201d Then he was gone in a green blur. </p>\n<p>\u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d Dabi asked, hefting his bag of money over his shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s like All Might, only worse.\u201d Shoto replied. \u201cWe\u2019re better off not messing with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he one of the people time-traveling with you then?\u201d Toga asked.</p>\n<p>Kurogiri is not one of those villains that seek the spotlight. He actively avoids it if he can. Notoriety is all well and good, but the brighter you shine, the more the cops look your way. The cops can\u2019t target you if they don\u2019t know you exist, and he\u2019s been careful about there being nothing to link the villain Kurogiri to his more mundane identity.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it's a very unwelcome surprise when he gets an email, and it\u2019s not from All for One. He doesn\u2019t know who its from, the names are not familiar and probably fake in any case. </p>\n<p>And they definitely know who he is. They want to hire him and his quirk for a mission. They apparently want him to rescue this little girl from a high security facility. (Which he knows basically means they want to kidnap someone\u2019s daughter/niece/little-sister to use as leverage.) They even have the exact coordinates he needs for his quirk, a list of the best times for him to find her alone, the promise that he will never have to worry that the cops will bust his bar (which he doesn\u2019t believe), along with the assurance that it will only take about five minutes and he won\u2019t have to listen to Shigaraki rant about how the latest boss in his game is a cheapass little bitch. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely a trap, is probably far more than it appears, and is definitely a bad idea.</p>\n<p>His eyes darted over to where Shigaraki is parked in front of the TV, a game controller in his hand, swearing and cursing at the characters on the screen. </p>\n<p>But goddamnit did they make a persuasive argument. </p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>For Eri, hope is black mist and a dark portal opening up in her room.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>There\u2019s two fourteen year old girls waiting for him when he gets to the meeting place. (A fenced off construction site.) One of them greets Eri by name, introduces herself as Ochako, then gives her a blanket and a candy apple before leading her off somewhere. Obviously she was chosen someone non-threatening to keep the girl from freaking out and making a scene. The other girl, a small thing with what appears to be audio-jacks dangling from her earlobes couldn\u2019t quite be explained off in the same way. </p>\n<p>She, to Kurogiri\u2019s surprise, produced a wad of bills. \u201cHere\u2019s your payment as promised.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kurogiri quickly counted the money, everything he had been promised indeed. Well except\u2026 \u201cHow do you propose to make it so I will never have to worry about the cops raiding my bar?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh that\u2019s easy, now that we\u2019ve wiped out the League of Villains there\u2019s nothing to really draw attention to your place. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d she added. \u201cWe made sure Shigaraki had left your bar before we thrashed him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2026 What? \u2026 </p>\n<p>It was at that moment the earth shook. Kurogiri first thought it was an earthquake, then he saw the pillar of fire mushrooming into the sky in the vague direction of Yokohama. </p>\n<p>The girl nodded grimly. \u201cYou can never be too careful with All for One. Overkill is usually the best policy. If that doesn\u2019t finish him off we\u2019ll have to send in Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not often the home phone in the Todoroki house rings, and the callers can usually be divided neatly up into three categories, people looking to reach either Endevor of Fuyumi for work reasons, telemarketers, and fans of Endevor who somehow got their hands on their phone number. So Fuyumi has no reason to expect anything different when the phone rings and she goes to answer it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello.\u201d The caller on the other end is a woman, though Fuyumi doesn\u2019t recognize the voice. \u201cIs this the Todoroki household?\u201d</p>\n<p>Probably not a fan then. Something for work? \u201cYes this is the Todoroki residence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I speaking to Shoto\u2019s mom?\u201d</p>\n<p>What? \u201cAh, no, I\u2019m Shoto\u2019s big sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026 can I speak to your mother then?\u201d</p>\n<p>The only people who would ask about their mother are people who already know she can\u2019t be reached here. \u201cShe\u2019s ummm, not living with us right now. She\u2019s been er\u2026 sick for a while.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOH! I\u2019m sorry! Can I speak to your father then?\u201d </p>\n<p>Does this woman not know who their father is? \u201cHe\u2019s also not here. He ummm, had an accident and is in the hospital right now.\u201d An accident that involved lots of ice, fire and falling down a flight of punches. </p>\n<p>\u201cAhh\u2026 well\u2026 maybe you can still help me. Have you noticed your little brother undergo any kind of strange or sudden change in personality lately? Like within the last year or so?\u201d </p>\n<p>Well he suddenly snapped and sent our father to the hospital after giving him frostbite and breaking every bone in his body. But we all figured that was\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about new friends? Is he suddenly best friends with people who had been complete strangers a month ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 Shoto has never really had any friends\u2026\u201d Father wouldn\u2019t let him. Except\u2026 there had been that Uraraka girl stopping by after Shoto put their father in the hospital. She had said she was an online friend of Shoto\u2019s. Shoto had also mentioned he was meeting up with someone named Midoriya whom she had never heard before\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he suddenly busy with some kind of project or plan and gets evasive when you ask him what he\u2019s doing?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Well\u2026 except\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p> It had been the middle of the night, she had woken up needing to use the bathroom. Shoto had been half out of the window, dressed all in black, a sword sheathed at his hip and a bandoleer of what looked like grenades strapped across his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a raccoon in the garbage.\u201d Had been his explanation.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re not the only one who's had something like this happen to someone they love. A group of us are going to be meeting this friday to talk about it. You\u2019re welcome to join us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve rented a room at the Mustafu community center. Just ask for Midoriya's group. We\u2019ll have cookies.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, so that\u2019s Stain, Overhaul, that woman with the tentacles, Kill Smasher, those Neo Stain guys, that mailman with the razor-paper quirk, and of course the near-entirety of the League of Villains.\u201d Izuku looked up from his notebook. \u201cI think that\u2019s everyone now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Preemptive total annihilation was not considered a practical crime prevention method. (Or even a sane one for that matter.) But if that\u2019s what it took to have a normal school year, than that\u2019s what they were going to do. Plus Kurogiri\u2019s bar made a good place to meet up away from the prying eyes of parents, teachers, police officers, and intelligence agents who all asked stupid questions. Kurogiri for his part just gave them a key to the back door, let them use one of the upstairs rooms, and told them he didn\u2019t want to know what they were up to, just don\u2019t break anything. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Izuku continued. \u201cNow that they\u2019re all taken care of we can move onto more important things. Any ideas on what we want to do for the cultural festival this loop?\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>There really was cookies. Fuyumi nibbled on a gingersnap shaped like All Might, as she listened to Kirishima\u2019s dad speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then one day he dyes his hair red, and before the dye has even dried there\u2019s this kid I have never seen before in my life knocking on the door saying he\u2019s Eijiro\u2019s friend, and Eijiro is greets him like they\u2019ve been buddies for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd after that,\u201d Kirishima\u2019s father added. \u201cHe starts coming home in the middle of the night smelling like smoke and suddenly knows how to pick locks.\u201d He ran a hand through his black hair. \u201cIts not manly to dump our problems onto strangers, but we have no idea what to do here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re all going through the same thing,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s mother said, patting Kirishima\u2019s dad on the arm. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that Izuku dislikes Mei. She\u2019s a very skilled support technician, and her devices are usually extremely useful. But she also a bit of a loose cannon with no regard for personal boundaries.</p>\n<p>But she also doesn\u2019t ask stupid questions. Like, \u2018why do you need twenty sets of motorized climbing equipment and a microwave receiver?\u2019 </p>\n<p>\u201cUmmm\u2026 excuse me. You\u2019re Hatsume Mei right?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Mei said, brushing past him. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk. I have work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWAIT! We want to commission some things from you. Form T2 things!\u201d </p>\n<p>Mei froze in mid-step. There was this awed kind of manic gleam in her eyes as she turned towards Izuku. </p>\n<p>\u201cI always knew time travelers would come looking for my services! What do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cThose class 1-A bastards are up to something.\u201d </p>\n<p>It had only been a week, and already Class 1-B had collectively learned to tune out most of what Monoma said if it involved Class 1-A, the government, organized religion, and the overuse of turnips in the cafeteria lunch menu. </p>\n<p>But he also kind of had a point this time. </p>\n<p>Class 1-A was definitely up to something. They had all started wearing dark glasses and small ear-sets. They had also started started standing around either watching people, or pointing strange instruments with microphones at the windows of various classrooms. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re watching us right now too,\u201d Ibara added, gesturing to a table in the far corner of the cafeteria. Everyone turned to the direction she indicated. </p>\n<p>Five sets of newspapers snapped up to cover faces. Which did nothing to encourage the kids of Class 1-B. </p>\n<p>They could all see the eye holes cut into them after all.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then he starts showing me all these outfits for little girls, and asking what I thought of them.\u201d Present Mic explained. \u201cThey were all hideous of course, but when I asked him why he needed to know, he said his niece was staying with him and she was going to need new clothes. He doesn\u2019t even have siblings, let alone a niece! I mean, I don\u2019t think it's anything nefarious, he\u2019s done stuff like this before when he got jobs from Witness Protection. But, there\u2019s so many other things going on. He\u2019s seemingly ignoring his class, not that they need it, they\u2019re acing all their other classes, and he\u2019s doing his other classes like normal, but its very out of character for him. I mean, I can sort of see Eri taking up some of his time, he already doesn\u2019t get enough sleep\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Inko interrupted. \u201cIs Eri about six years old, has stark white hair and a single bronze horn poking out of her forehead about here?\u201d She gestured to the side of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s exactly her,\u201d Mic exclaimed. \u201cYou know her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, not exactly,\u201d Inko explained. \u201cI got home early one day and Izuku was in the kitchen with this little girl showing her how to make candy apples. He said her name was Eri and he was doing a Big Brothers and Sisters program through the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had something similar happen,\u201d Jirou\u2019s mom added. \u201cOur daughter brought home this little girl one day and started teaching her how to play guitar. When we asked she said she was a little sister of one of her classmates. None of your have a little girl like that right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Everyone in the room shook their head.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>It had been a normal for class 1-B. Then Jirou fell through the ceiling. </p>\n<p>Vlad King had nearly attacked her until he realized who she was. He almost did, even then. Jirou wasn\u2019t wearing her school uniform. Instead she had on a plain black suit, along with the dark glasses and ear-pieces Class 1-A had taken to wearing. She was also surrounded by bits of ceiling tile and, where those listening devices? </p>\n<p>Jirou climbed to her feet, brushed pieces of ceiling tile off her clothes, then grabbed the listening device.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour pipes need fixing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then she just left.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re worried about Class 1-A.\u201d </p>\n<p>Nedzu looked up from his paperwork at the teachers assembled in front of his desk. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re up to something. They\u2019re not even trying to hide it. They\u2019re even baiting everyone about it.\u201d Vald King said. \u201cMonoma is literally frothing at the mouth trying to figure out what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to mention that I have a major suspicion none of them are doing any schoolwork. And Aizawa is letting them get away with it.\u201d Midnight added.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re passing the tests.\u201d Nedzu pointed out. \u201cAnd getting all their assignments done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they shouldn\u2019t be.They\u2019re treating every assignment they get like they already know the perfect solution ahead of time. I would suspect cheating except I cheating to this degree would involve far more resources and time than any group of persons in this entire school have.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell time travelers like them have no shortage of time,\u201d Nedzu mussed. \u201cBut I think this case is more a matter of continued repetition and practice rather than any attempt to subvert the system. Unavoidable really.\u201d </p>\n<p>He took in the teachers gobsmacked looks.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Keep forgetting that\u2019s not obvious to most people.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cSo when Katsuki gets home he immediately heads to the fridge, and eats the last of the yogurt.\u201d Bakugou Masaru explained. \u201cThen Mitsuki comes in and they get into an argument about consideration for other people in the house, eating food before it goes bad, and putting labels on things. While they are arguing, Katsuki\u2019s friends rush into the house, up the stairs, and begin hauling things out of Katsuki\u2019s room. I counted at least three large crates, a potted plant, a steel table, and a large rolled up carpet. Not to mention several duffle bags they kept bringing back in and reloading. They just finish hauling the last item out when Katsuki yells \u2018FINE I WON\u2019T TOUCH THE FUCKING YOGURT!\u2019 and storms out of the door after them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat little shit,\u201d Mitsuki muttered.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>It had been a whim. Gentle would admit that. Breaking into a highschool cultural festival was hardly the sort of feat that would burn his name into the annals of history. But a part of him had always wanted to see the inside of the UA campus for himself. Plus their media ratings had been on a downward trend lately. They could do another video of them robbing a convenience store, or they could mix it up a little. </p>\n<p>La Brava had hacked into UA\u2019s network and made them both fake guest passes. Those had gotten them through the gate. Once that was done, everyone apparently assumed that if they were there, then they must have clearance. Gentle suspected that as long as he didn\u2019t draw too much attention to himself, like say, by going up to one of the many famous heroes around and asking for an interview, they would probably leave him alone. </p>\n<p>Besides, this was actually turning out to be kind of fun.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they don\u2019t have candy apples here.\u201d La Brava complained, panning the camera around to show more of the festival.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost disgraceful,\u201d Gentle agreed. \u201cWhat should we attend to next?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Class 1-A has got a booth nearby,\u201d La Brava replied, pointing to a small map tacked to a post. \u201cApparently it\u2019s some kind of fortune\u2026 telling\u2026 booth.\u201d </p>\n<p>The trio of black vans parked in the spot did not look like a fortune-teller booth. They looked like a shady government stakeout. An image not helped by the array of antennas and radio dishes bolted to the roof of one of them, or the students standing around in black suits and sunglasses casting suspicious looks at everyone. Blocky white letters on the side of one van just said \u201cFortunes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s spy themed apparently.\u201d Gentle remarked.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you 1-A Bastards think your so great just because you fit fluorescent lights and a two-way mirror into a van?\u201d Monoma sneered.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the steel table, Ashido remained silent. She just held out her hand and accepted the folder Iida handed to her. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou think your so high and mighty with your listening devices and secret code words. But we\u2019re on to you! You won\u2019t get the better of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you say that when you wet the bed during that overnight class-trip when you were seven?\u201d </p>\n<p>Monoma\u2019s mouth snapped shut. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about when you put that baseball through Old Lady Tokomori\u2019s window? You never did tell your parents about that did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mina smiled. \u201cWe know everything about you Neito Monoma.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Izuku had to give Yaoyorozu credit, she had done an excellent job on Eri\u2019s little suit and dark glasses. Eri wasn\u2019t in on the joke of course, but she had been happy enough to copy what her adopted older siblings were doing, and more importantly she was having fun.</p>\n<p>At the moment they were sitting at a picnic table and Eri was nibbling on the candy apple he had brought for her. The booth was turning out to be surprisingly popular, and there was even a line. Actually, now that he looked, that line hadn\u2019t moved in fifteen minutes. </p>\n<p>What was Mina doing in there?</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cWe knew what you were doing from the moment you started doing it.\u201d Mina said. \u201cThe only difference is whether or not you\u2019ll confess or not. Believe me, you will regret it if you make things difficult for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI confess!\u201d Monoma shrieked, huddling in his uncomfortable steel chair. He had absolutely no idea what he was confessing to.</p>\n<p>Neither did Mina.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the festival was apparently a success,\u201d Sero said as they all sat down at the lunch table. \u201cAt least two-thirds of the school is now jittery in our presence, and at least half are convinced we actually do work for a secret world conspiracy.\u201d </p>\n<p>Now that the festival was over, they had ditched the dark glasses and the whole charade of pretending they hadn\u2019t already gathered all the information they needed two whole loops ago. It was back to being normal students for them.</p>\n<p>For some reason that just made people even more uneasy.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what do you guys have planned for the rest of the school year. I was just planning of laying back and relaxing for\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>A great primeval roar suddenly erupted from the direction of the ocean with enough force to make the entire building shake.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking Mother of Monsters,\u201d Bakugou growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew we forgot someone,\u201d Izuku groaned.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Mom!\u201d Izuku burst into the house and raced up the stairs to him room, not even bothering to wait for his mom\u2019s reply.</p>\n<p>Mother of Monsters, of all the villain groups they had forgotten to wipe up before the school year started, it had to be the nutbar terrorists who were trying to distinguish themselves by raising gigantic sea-life with powerful and unusual quirks. In their defence they had only really had to deal with Mother of Monsters twice before. Usually the group was stomped down by larger and more powerful groups like the Eight Precepts or the League of Villains. Or was busted by the cops in the wake of the increased security put in place by escalating villain attacks. </p>\n<p>Regardless, they were still a dangerous group to deal with, especially when they got the chance to raise one of their monsters to full adulthood. No taking chances. </p>\n<p>Izuku stuffed two bandoliers of syringe darts into his bag, along with an extra large bottle of monsters tranqs. That was immediately followed by the first aid kit, the emergency surgery kit, and the \u2018we\u2019ll sew you back together later\u2019 kit. There was also the rocket-propelled grenades, the bundle of flower crowns, and the cage full of mice.</p>\n<p>He also grabbed The Leveler from its spot on his dresser and flicked it on. Red warning lights lit up along its length, the clear tube in the middle started to glow green, and it let out an ominous humming sound. Hopefully they wouldn\u2019t have to demonstrate to Mei that it was aptly named.</p>\n<p>He raced back down the stairs. His mom was sitting in the living room with Kacchan\u2019s parents, as well as Kirishima\u2019s dads, Mina\u2019s mom, Kouta\u2019s ma and pop, and\u2026 the parents or guardians of everyone in his class. Even Present Mic was seating in one of the living room\u2019s more comfortable chairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh the community center is closed for renovations,\u201d his mom explained. \u201cSo we\u2019re having our parent support group here instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>Parent support group?</i>\n</p>\n<p>He was just about to ask with another primeval roar reverberated across the city.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry mom, have to run. School business! Bye!\u201d</p>\n<p>He could ask after they\u2019d dealt with the attack of the twenty meter sea-cucumber.</p>"
