  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro is not afraid of Nami.</p>\n<p>Zoro is not afraid of <em>anything</em>, when it comes down to it. He has faced Shichibukais without so much as a flinch, staring down Dracule Mihawk <em>and</em> Bartholomew Kuma with swords drawn and head held high. He has fought literal sea kings. He has challenged <em>admirals</em> into a swordfight. Fear is not so much of an enemy as it is an old adversary he has beaten, time and again.</p>\n<p>But, well, Nami.</p>\n<p>The woman herself is currently smiling at him in that way of hers that seems to promise a horrifying, bitter fate to him and his wallet, Zoro\u2019s bravery and sword skills notwithstanding. Zoro puts his hands in his pockets, and his swords clatter against each other in his hips as he turns to face her, head on, because that is what he does best. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>She just <em>smiles</em>. Wider.</p>\n<p>\u201cZo-ro,\u201d she sing-songs, completely devoid of malice and therefore completely terrifying, \u201cwould you care to explain what is going on with Sanji-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man in question seems oblivious to the tension in the air, though he doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a <em>man</em> either right now. Which is the <em>problem</em>, really. Sanji looks up to him, reaches up to Zoro\u2019s haramaki with his too-small hands, and gurgles an innocent, child-like imitation of Nami\u2019s sarcastic, \u201cZo-ro.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami <em>looks</em> at the little kid, back at Zoro, and says, \u201c<em>explain</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro isn\u2019t afraid of Nami. <em>Really</em>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, he comes quite close.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thing about devil fruits, and the New World, and the crew\u2019s entire life ever since the kid with a straw hat and a rubbery smile barged his way into their life, really, is that they tend to be unpredictable. Fight happens. Shit happens.</p>\n<p>Zoro thinks it is such an exaggeration, then, that Nami is yelling at him just because Sanji turned into a ten-year-old in the middle of\u00a0a supply run with Zoro.</p>\n<p>At that, Chopper turns to Sanji. \u201cHow old are you, Sanji?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji blinks and looks sheepishly at his fingers. He frowns at them, slowly puts some of them up, before deciding with, \u201ceight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. Shit. Even younger, then.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nami says, once she has considerably calmed down. Sanji is now sitting beside Chopper at the ship\u2019s deck, sharing a stick of cotton candy Sanji\u2019s adult self has made earlier that day. Little Sanji\u2019s eyes brighten like he has never seen the food before, and he giggles happily into the candy, face half-buried in the colorful treat.</p>\n<p>He is almost\u2026 cute, if Zoro didn\u2019t know any better.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nami repeats. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Luffy tilts his head, confused. \u201cDo what? We just need to find the guy who did this to Sanji and ask him to turn him back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what, sail in the New World with a little kid on our ship?\u201d Nami gestures at the kid. \u201cHe\u2019s only eight!\u201d</p>\n<p>For once, Zoro agrees with her. None of them are really equipped to take care of a little kid, much less this\u2026<em>version</em> of Sanji. Zoro always thought\u2014not that he has given it much thought before\u2014that a younger Sanji would be exactly like his adult self: shameless, loud-mouthed, whiny. Annoying.</p>\n<p>Brave.</p>\n<p>The little kid in front of him is anything but.</p>\n<p>In fact, the first thing Little Sanji did as soon as he came to was hide under the kitchen table. He was shaking all over, peering at the crew from behind the foot of the table, and while Zoro could see the fight in his eyes, it was in flashes, drowned more often than not by his fears and insecurities. He also kept touching his own face, like he was expecting to feel something there, and found himself surprised to find\u00a0his own skin instead.</p>\n<p>It took them all two whole hours to coax the kid out of the table. Zoro had given up before he even tried, figuring that the rest of the crew would have the distinct advantage of not having only one eye and carrying three swords, but they\u00a0fast realized being a two-meter-tall cyborg, a guy with suspiciously long nose, a rubber kid who can stretch all parts of his body and a literal skeleton did not really help either.</p>\n<p>Sanji only came out after all the male adults are kicked out of the galley. He quickly bonds with Chopper, who looks as threatening as a pile of candies and soft fur, and Zoro watches them talk animatedly to each other as the rest tries to figure out the solution to the dire situation at hand.</p>\n<p>Luffy pouts at Nami. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving Sanji behind! He\u2019s our cook. Who else is going to cook me meat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, that option is out of the window too, then. Alas.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait around either,\u201d Robin observes. \u201cThe hostile pirate crew retreated immediately when they figured out they were losing. They probably have left for the next island, for fear of running into us again on this island.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luffy grins at that and pumps his fist. \u201cTo the next island, then!\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami wears an expression of someone who just swallowed a scream and a sigh at the same time. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says, more to herself than to any of them. \u201cOkay. But we have to at least buy some supplies first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somewhere across the deck, Sanji giggles at something Chopper says. His laughter is light, the kind that bubbles up from deep in your chest, and Zoro distantly thinks he has never heard Sanji laugh like that before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Little Sanji is not afraid Brook, Zoro learns, which is boring.</p>\n<p>He <em>is</em> afraid of <em>Usopp</em>, which is hilarious. Zoro can\u2019t help the amused grin on his face that appears every time he sees the little kid skittering away from Usopp, eyes darting around as if Usopp would suddenly jump out of nowhere with five different species of insects in his hands. Their recent excursion into the insect-infested jungle on the previous island seems to have left some scars on the poor kid, and Zoro mentally shelves this information for a future argument with the cook.</p>\n<p>The most bewildering part of it all, though, is that Sanji seems to like <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>The little kid, he quickly notices, chooses to hang around Zoro a lot. On the deck. Up in the crow\u2019s nest. At the dinner table. Whenever they dock, he inches closer towards Zoro, who immediately gets assigned with babysitting duties for the rest of the visit.</p>\n<p>Zoro isn\u2019t bad with kids. Zoro is great with kids the same way he\u2019s great with people\u2014they don\u2019t annoy him if they don\u2019t speak too much, and if he\u2019s not annoyed, he doesn\u2019t try to slice them into five different pieces.</p>\n<p>And little Sanji doesn\u2019t annoy him, contrary to popular belief. Zoro even has a hard time matching the image of the little kid with his adult self\u2014little Sanji isn\u2019t loud, or overbearing, or whiny. He is quiet, he rarely cries, and he doesn\u2019t seem to have an irrepressible urge to ruin an adult\u2019s day through temper tantrums like most kids of his age. All things considered, Zoro figures he doesn\u2019t mind Sanji\u2019s company much.</p>\n<p>The rest of the crew gradually takes notice.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s something wrong with Sanji-kun?\u201d Nami asks as Zoro lifts his weight, Sanji perching comfortably on top of it, head bobbing up and down in turn with the weight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever considered that the guy, uh, replaced Sanji with a different kid with similar eyebrows?\u201d Usopp wonders out loud as Sanji happily eats the slices of oranges Zoro is feeding him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy, my,\u201d Robin says much more directly, as Sanji wraps his arm around Zoro\u2019s head, his free hand swinging a duck plushie Zoro got him from a festival on the island they\u2019re currently docked at. \u201cYou two are adorable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Zoro tells all of them. He feels like he should be more concerned about this development, but Sanji is wiggling on his lap, trying to find a more comfortable position for his afternoon nap, and Zoro shifts lower on the sofa so Sanji can use his chest as a pillow. He can leave the concerns for future Zoro.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro jerks awake in his sleep.</p>\n<p>He jolts upright in his hammock, his right hand already reaching halfway towards Wado before he realizes that the terrified, head-splitting scream he\u2019s hearing comes from the hammock beside him.</p>\n<p><em>Sanji, </em>his sleep-muddled brain finally registers, and his eyes meet Usopp\u2019s bleary ones as a look of understanding passes between them. This isn\u2019t the first night this happens ever since their cook turned into a wide-eyed eight-year-old, and by now they have a system. If \u2018warily looking around with terrified faces until Zoro wakes up\u2019 counts as a system, that is.</p>\n<p>Zoro climbs out of his hammock and there he is\u2014the little kid. Curling into himself, feet bent and tucked under his arms, tiny pinpricks of tears falling from his closed eyes. By now the scream has dissipated into shaky, distressed whimpers, and Zoro doesn\u2019t know which sounds worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d he nudges the kid\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCook,\u201d he calls him, like he always does, because Sanji might be eight but he\u2019s still <em>Sanji</em>. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji just hunches further. He does that a lot, Zoro notices\u2014hunching his shoulders. He always thought it was one of Sanji\u2019s stupid habits to look cool in front of the ladies, like smoking and wearing three layers of clothing every day, but now, reflected on his eight-year-old self, it looks eerily similar to a defensive posture. As if someone has told Sanji, over and over again, that he is taking up too much space just for existing.</p>\n<p>Zoro doesn\u2019t like where his thoughts are going, so he decides to nudge the kid again. \u201cOi, cook,\u201d he tries, \u201cit\u2019s just a dream.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji is still deep in his nightmare, but he seems to subconsciously realize Zoro\u2019s presence, because he uncurls from himself and turns his head towards Zoro\u2019s hand. Sanji nuzzles at the hand, cheek rubbing softly against Zoro\u2019s calloused hand, and Zoro\u2019s breath snugs in his chest.</p>\n<p>He goes quiet, eventually. So does the rest of the men\u2019s quarter soon after. Zoro stays like that for a long time, runs his thumb on the kid's cheek, steadying, grounding. He thinks of the Sanji he sailed with, who only went to sleep after the crew was fed and the dishes were washed, long after the rest of the crew had tucked in for the night, and woke up earlier than everyone else to prepare their breakfast.</p>\n<p>Zoro doesn't know if Sanji eventually grew out of these nightmares, or if he simply just got better at masking them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d Zoro hears Usopp say from the lawn deck, followed by Franky\u2019s, \u201cit\u2019s time for you to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can keep watch too,\u201d is Sanji\u2019s petulant reply. Zoro sits up on the sofa in the aquarium room to get a better view of the three, and just as Usopp said, the little kid is clearly tired, hands absent-mindedly rubbing his eyes to chase away the sleep.</p>\n<p>They had an attack from the marines earlier in the day, and Zoro had instructed Franky to carry Sanji to safety before things could go South for all of them. Usopp had locked him inside the galley, and when they returned after the fight Sanji\u2019s hands and feet were bleeding because he tried to break the door down and joined in on the fight.</p>\n<p>Zoro conceded that he was wrong with his initial judgment. The little Sanji now may be physically weak, the destructive power of his kicks Zoro is familiar with has not been trained into the muscles of his legs, but the fighting spirit, the dogged, untiring perseverance? That\u2019s all <em>Sanji</em>, powerful kicks or not. They both know he would go down easily in a fight in the New World, but he would still go down fighting.</p>\n<p>It must have been frustrating then, Zoro figures, for the kid to have stayed inside the galley as the rest of the crew fought for their lives. As the rest of the crew fought for <em>his</em> life.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, li\u2019l bro,\u201d Franky replies, waving a dismissive hand at Sanji, \u201cit\u2019s Usopp-bro\u2019s turn now, anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was supposed to be <em>my </em>turn,\u201d Sanji counters. \u201cI saw the schedule when I was getting some tomatoes from the pantry. It was supposed to be my turn, but I\u2019m, I\u2019m too\u2014\u201d he seems to struggle with his words, before finally spitting out, \u201c<em>weak</em>, now, to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Franky and Usopp shake their heads. Franky pats him on the head. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not true. You\u2019re plenty strong yourself, kiddo\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust let me do this one thing\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I told you about how the Brave Warrior Usopp kept watch of the ship for five days\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not <em>useless</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>The outburst renders the whole deck mute.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s face is red, redder than the roses on Robin\u2019s flower bed. One hand is clenched at his side, nails digging into his palm, and the other grabs a fistful of his own hair\u2014a nervous tick, Zoro has learned. Sanji\u2019s hands always go to his head whenever he is under any pressure; his hair, his face. Like there is something on his head he\u2019s trying to make sure is there\u2014or <em>isn\u2019t</em> there.</p>\n<p>The adults are silent for a beat, not knowing what to tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so maybe you\u2019re not so super with fights,\u201d Franky concedes, but quickly adds when he sees Sanji is about to burst into tears, \u201cbut that\u2019s not so bad, y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji blinks at that. \u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s cool to punch people and all, but we all can fight, so it\u2019s nothing special,\u201d Franky shrugs. \u201cYou give Chopper a friend of his age that he has always wanted, and you can make all these little treats and cakes that taste <em>super</em>, and you\u2019re, you know,\u201d he flips his sunglasses up and gestures at the kid, \u201c<em>you</em>. And that\u2019s what matters, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji looks at Franky like someone has just told him that his entire life was a lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone once told me,\u201d Usopp adds, and there\u2019s a hint of a smile in his voice, like he\u2019s telling an inside joke, \u201cEveryone has something they can and cannot do. So we\u2019ll do what you can\u2019t and you\u2019ll do what we can\u2019t\u2014we got your back on the fighting thing until you\u2019re strong, and you\u2019ll stock us up on the sweets department, how about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another moment as the words seem to sink in, and then a giddy smile breaks across Sanji\u2019s face. He nods vigorously, bang swaying, and Zoro catches a glimpse of the other half of his face. \u201cI can do that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Franky pats him on the head again. It\u2019s the same gesture, but this time it does not reek of condescension like it did before. \u201cBut now it\u2019s not the time. Time to sleep and let Usopp-bro do his work!\u201d He says, grabs the kid by the hips and places him on his left shoulder. Sanji giggles and grabs Franky\u2019s hair to steady himself.</p>\n<p>Zoro watches them go, disappearing into the men\u2019s quarters.</p>\n<p>He feels something, soft and painful, humming beneath his ribcage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCook,\u201d Sanji says without preamble.</p>\n<p>Zoro is confused by the sudden turn in the conversation, but not confused enough to stop his push-up. <em>Two-hundred and one, </em>he counts<em>, two-hundred and two. \u201cYou\u2019re </em>the cook,\u201d he points out. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not, though,\u201d the kid argues. Sanji is smarter than most kids his age, and after the first week he pretty much figured out that there were some devil fruits mumbo-jumbo involved. The kid seems to have taken it in stride. \u201cRobin cooks breakfast and Nami cooks our dinners. All i did was make simple snacks every now and then.\u201d He looks down at his hands. \u201cEveryone calls me Sanji, or Sanji-chan, or little kid.\u201d He seems to have gathered up the courage to ask, \u201cwhy do you still call me cook?\u201d</p>\n<p>This question <em>is</em> enough to make him stop his training. <em>Two-hundred and three, four, five</em>, he finishes his set, and stands up. Sanji looks at him with expectant eyes, shy but eager. Zoro sighs; he\u2019s never been good with words.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not\u2026 I mean, the other you and me\u2026\u201d he tries, and shrugs helplessly. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong here, kid\u2014we\u2019re <em>nakama</em>, and there\u2019s no one I\u2019d trust more to have my back in a fight than you, but we don\u2019t exactly hold hands and share our feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks of Sanji\u2014confident, quick-witted, smack-talking Sanji. \u201cI called you that because I could, then to get a raise out of you, and then it just became a habit.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably not the answer Sanji is looking for, but Zoro thinks Sanji deserves nothing less than Zoro\u2019s honesty. But the kid is also that\u2014a <em>kid</em>\u2014so he adds, \u201cbut most importantly, I called you that because you <em>are</em> a cook. Or you will be, I guess. There are a lot of things I don\u2019t get about you, but this is the one thing I\u2019m sure of.\u201d</p>\n<p>That seems to be enough for Sanji. Zoro sees him visibly relax, and the tension in the air eases that Zoro starts making his way towards his dumbbells.</p>\n<p>They stay there in companionable silence, Zoro training and Sanji rolling around on the floor, but curiosity eventually gets to Zoro and he blurts out, \u201cwhy do you follow me around so much?\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels ridiculous for asking why an eight-year-old does what he does, but Sanji simply does another roll on the floor, face down. \u201cI like you a lot, Zoro!\u201d he says, honest in the way only a kid of his age could, \u201cand even though you\u2019re strong, and you train too much, you\u2019re not like\u2014<em>some people</em> I know,\u201d he says. Sanji does that sometimes\u2014catching himself mid-sentence and changing them. Zoro doesn\u2019t push; they all have their ghosts, and if Sanji wants to tell him, he will. \u201cYou fight not just to be strong. You fight because you want to protect people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro feels warmth creep up his face from Sanji\u2019s words, and makes a point to ignore it. \u201cSo did you.\u201d <em>Most, out of all of us,</em> he doesn\u2019t say. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I strong enough to do that?\u201d the kid asks, his earlier insecurity returning. \u201cI mean, I\u2026 I\u2019m not really good at the fighting thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will, if you start training.\u201d He thinks of the last sparring he had with the cook; he can still feel the phantom pain where Sanji kicked him square in the stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t know what got you so worried. The you I know, he could handle himself in a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji beams.</p>\n<p>The mood is light and Zoro is already embarrassed anyways, so he decides a one last push. \"So? Is that,\u201d He grunts. \u201cWhy you followed me.\"</p>\n<p>Sanji flops again on the floor and looks up at the ceiling. \u201cThat, and also,\u201d he says. The grin stays on his face, wide wide <em>wide</em>. \"Because you called me cook.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro doesn\u2019t know which was worse\u2014learning that Sanji is <em>different</em>, that there\u2019s this gentle, quiet personality Zoro likes that his adult self must have hid under layers and layers of misguided masculinity, or learning that at the end of the day, Sanji is <em>not</em> so different, really, and Zoro has always liked him all along.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a ludicrously long list of things Nami can get away with when it comes to the love cook, but this is probably the one thing Sanji will finally, <em>finally</em> snap at her for.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does it look like someone exploded a bomb in the middle of the kitchen?\u201d Zoro asks as he enters the galley. It is not an exaggeration\u2014there is flour on top of every available surface, and Nami is standing in the middle of the mess, holding onto what looks like a cake batter, if one is generous with the definition of cake batters and include details like \u201cshit-brown in color\u201d and \u201ccan kill you through substance poisoning.\u201d</p>\n<p>He kind of regrets asking now. He doesn\u2019t think he is prepared to deal with this.</p>\n<p>She looks at him like she is torn between telling him and kicking him out of the galley. Desperation seems to win out in the end, though, because she goes with, \u201cIt\u2019s Chopper\u2019s birthday soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro <em>totally</em> knows that. \u201cI knew that,\u201d he says, just to make sure she knows this.</p>\n<p>Nami wears the same skeptical look she always gives Zoro whenever Sanji complains about missing alcohol on the ship. \u201cSure you do,\u201d she says, but moves on to a more pressing problem at hand. \u201cRobin and I can cook regular meals just fine, but cakes are kind of outside of our expertise.\u201d Zoro opens his mouth to reply, but she holds up her hand. \u201cAnd before you\u2019re trying to offer help, let me remind you that the last time you cooked, you almost killed half the crew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on! That was <em>once</em>,\u201d Zoro objects.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Four times</em>, Zoro. We had to rush Chopper and Luffy to a hospital that one time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Che. Ungrateful witch. See if Zoro ever offers her help ever again.</p>\n<p>Zoro is about to turn and leave the galley when he suddenly remembers his conversation with Sanji on the crow\u2019s nest, a few days ago. \u201cHow about the cook?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami snorts. \u201cSanji-kun? In case you forgot, he is eight years old now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks of the way Sanji looked in the crow\u2019s nest\u2014small and insecure in ways that made Zoro want to stab whoever was putting that expression on his face\u2014and Zoro has to remind himself that Nami meant well. \u201cHe\u2019s still the cook,\u201d Zoro says instead. \u201cHe\u2019s been fine making simple snacks so far. Let him get a bigger project for once; pretty sure the kid is dying for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since Zoro looked at one of his <em>nakama</em> and doesn\u2019t instantly know what they\u2019re thinking, but right now, he can\u2019t read Nami\u2019s expression at all. Nami <em>looks</em> at him, face pensive, before a smirk tugs at her lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this for Sanji-kun,\u201d she guesses.</p>\n<p>Zoro <em>doesn\u2019t </em>blush, and definitely doesn\u2019t sputter, \u201cshut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>She covers her mouth with her hands. \u201cYou really <em>are</em>,\u201d she says, and her tone is positively <em>giddy</em>, like someone just gave\u00a0her a million berries. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this for <em>him</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d he declares, and clears his throat, before adding, \u201cdon\u2019t tell the cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat goes to your debt!\u201d Nami simply says before the door of the galley slams close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cake is a success, and if Chopper is happy, Sanji looks practically <em>glowing</em>.</p>\n<p>His eyes dart around the room, drinking in the sights of people eating his cake. He seems nervous but excited, and the combination makes him vibrate in his seat like a ticking time bomb. Luffy tells him for the fourth time that the cake tastes good, and Zoro suspects the kid is <em>this</em> close to getting a heart attack at the tender age of eight.</p>\n<p>When the party dwindles down, he catches Nami talking to the little kid, and\u2014damn it. He should\u2019ve known; Nami is going to spill the beans because she\u2019s <em>Nami</em> and being scared of Zoro has sadly never been coded in her DNA.</p>\n<p>Zoro sees her leaning down to whisper something into Sanji\u2019s ears, and something tugs in his chest when he sees the kid\u2019s jaw drop comically. Zoro tries to duck his head, but he isn\u2019t fast enough\u2014Sanji whips his head towards him, and their eyes meet across the room.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s face splits into a slow-starting smile.</p>\n<p>The smile is ridiculously wide, sunny and all teeth and so very <em>Sanji</em>. Zoro thinks of the Sanji he knows, twenty-one-year-old, fierce and violent and <em>stupid</em>, and, <em>oh</em>, he knows, in that moment, deep in his bones, thrumming beneath his ribcage, that he is in love.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sail.</p>\n<p>They sail, and sail, and <em>sail</em>. Days turn into weeks, into months, and one day Zoro enters the galley and realizes that the smell of smoke has disappeared completely from the Sunny\u2019s kitchen.</p>\n<p>It has been three months since Sanji turned into a small kid, and Zoro realizes one simple fact with a start, like a light switch being flipped over somewhere at the back of his mind.</p>\n<p>He misses Sanji.</p>\n<p>Not the little kid. He loves the kid, he grudgingly admits within the safety of his own mind, but he misses <em>Sanji</em>, and it\u2019s the one he always bickers with. The one who kicks him in the face to wake him up, who never fails to push all his buttons, who swoons in that annoying way of his whenever a member of female population is in the vicinity. Loud, foul-mouthed, <em>irritating </em>Sanji.</p>\n<p>The same Sanji who secretly makes Zoro\u2019s favorite food whenever he notices that the swordsman is down. Sanji, who he can trust with his back in a fight, who continues to challenge Zoro into a better version of himself, who never learns <em>not </em>to be kind. Sanji, who never lets a single soul go hungry.\u00a0Sanji, who smiles brighter than the sun outside the windows of the galley.</p>\n<p>Sanji, who\u2014he\u2019s in love with.</p>\n<p>This is getting a little out of hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s four months and three days since Sanji turned into a kid (not that Zoro is, what, <em>keeping count</em> like a love-struck fool who has nothing better to do) when Zoro finally comes across the guy who is responsible for all these.</p>\n<p>Zoro meets him in a <em>bar</em>, out of all places, by pure chance. Zoro is never one to question his luck.</p>\n<p>Instead he gets directly down to business\u2014he unsheathes Kitetsu, leaps across the room and plunges the sword through the man\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even let the man finish screaming when he says, \u201cit seems like we have some unfinished business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pain must have clouded the man\u2019s memory because he looks confused for a second, but one sweeping look at Zoro\u2014one eye and three swords\u2014is always enough to jog anyone\u2019s memory and match the appearance with the name and reputation.</p>\n<p>\u201cPirate Hunter Zoro,\u201d the man chokes out\u2014in fear or pain, Zoro doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Zoro agrees. \u201cYou have two options now. You undo what you\u2019ve done,\u201d he says, something dark twists and curls in the pit of his stomach. \u201cOr you don\u2019t, and I\u2019m going to give you a <em>gentle</em> push. And <em>then</em> you\u2019ll undo what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kitetsu trembles\u00a0in his grip, but the man\u2019s voice even more so. \u201cI,\u201d he whimpers, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro twists the sword. It never fails to get people to do what he wants, in his experience. Zoro is distantly grateful that he doesn\u2019t bring Sanji with him for once.</p>\n<p>The man cries out. \u201cNo\u2014no, you don\u2019t understand! I <em>can\u2019t</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro feels his stomach sink. \u201cAre you saying that your power is permanent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d the man gasps in between tears. \u201cYour friend, B\u2014Black Leg, wasn\u2019t it? He can turn back, but I can\u2019t make him to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro doesn\u2019t have time for this. \u201cSpeak clearly or this is the last time you get to speak with both legs intact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has to <em>want</em> to turn back!\u201d The guy blurts, panicked. \u201cMy power, it, uh, only sticks when the victim doesn\u2019t want to turn back, which makes it pretty useless in the long run. Kids, you see, they tend to want to grow up real fast. Especially when they\u2019re told that they really <em>are </em>an adult.\u201d The man even has the gall to look ecstatic for a second when he says, \u201cthis is actually the first time it sticks for so long! How long has it been? Three months, at least, right\u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro knocks him unconscious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Does Sanji not want to turn back? Zoro thinks of the first time he met the kid Sanji\u2014frightened, lost, and with the air of resignation that felt out of place for a little kid like him. He had wanted to survive, but probably not...grew up, specifically. But what about after?</p>\n<p>They got to know each other, he tries to recall. Then the kid grew into his space in the ship, one that easily accepted him with open arms, and allowed him to go by his own pace, and\u2014well, <em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s <em>too</em> happy?\u201d Nami says when Zoro breaks the news. \u201cThe reason that Sanji-kun hasn\u2019t turned back yet is because we made him <em>too happy</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot too loud!\u201d Usopp shushes her, and takes a quick glance outside the window. Chopper, Luffy and Sanji continue to play tag on the deck, oblivious, but Usopp lowers his voice anyways, \u201cthey might hear us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d Franky asks, his tone devoid of his usual optimism for once. \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell someone to <em>want </em>something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the problem is him being too comfortable, then maybe we can, I don\u2019t know, make him sad?\u201d Nami proposes.</p>\n<p>They can hear Sanji giggling happily from the deck.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond option,\u201d they all unanimously agree. They may be ruthless pirates, but they\u2019re not about to make this kid <em>sad</em>. They have <em>standards</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about positive reinforcement?\u201d Robin, ever-rational, suggests. \u201cEvery time he has a pleasant experience, we imply that he would enjoy it even more as an adult. Over time, the need to <em>become</em> one eventually wins over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro observes the whole discussion go down. He is doubtful that this...positive reinforcement bullshit would work, but he has seen what Robin can do with her hands and a male\u2019s private part in a not-fun kind of way, so he wisely shuts up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It turns out that they don\u2019t need positive re-in-whatever when a sword sticking through Zoro\u2019s chest can do the job just fine.</p>\n<p>It hurts like <em>hell, </em>like someone stuffed burning coals inside his chest, but it also feels distant, like he is forced to feel someone else\u2019s pain. He fumbles for his blades but he can barely make out anything by this point, his vision blurring at the edges, so he just kind of <em>lets go</em> and falls down on his side.</p>\n<p>He should get up and do something.</p>\n<p>He should.</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s right hand falls outstretched on the ground and it is soaked in blood. There is blood everywhere, now that he really looks at it\u2014on the ground, on his shirt. His green haramaki is growing darker by the second with it.</p>\n<p>But then, out of the corner of his eye, something red-hot flashes into view.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a blurry mess after that, fire and smoke and bodies fall around him, but Zoro has stopped struggling to get up and fight again. He knows what those flashes <em>mean</em>, can only associate fire with one specific person, and it is not a child\u2019s voice that he hears when Sanji\u2019s voice calls out an urgent, \u201cZoro!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro is tired, but he smirks anyways when he sees a black and blonde figure rushing towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Zoro!</em>\u201d The voice calls out again, and yeah, not a child. Good.</p>\n<p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d he hears himself rasp.</p>\n<p>The voice says something in response to that, but Zoro is <em>tired</em>. He thinks there\u2019s a hand, a thumb running on the side of his cheek, before he fades completely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro wakes up to a pissed off, dishevelled, very <em>adult</em> Sanji staring down at him.</p>\n<p>Zoro blinks and takes him all in. He looks pale, like something has shaken him up from the inside, and Zoro is bracing himself for a rehash of their argument in Thriller Bark\u2014the whole thing about recklessness and sacrifices, lessons that Sanji preaches but never practices himself.</p>\n<p>Except. It never comes.</p>\n<p>Instead Sanji stretches his arms and wraps them around Zoro\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\u2026 weird, is what he wanted to say, but it really isn\u2019t. Zoro and Sanji have spent the last few weeks practically attached at the hips, and Zoro frankly has forgotten what it\u2019s like not to share his personal space with Sanji, so he musters all his energy to lift an arm and drape it around Sanji\u2019s middle.</p>\n<p>It <em>is </em>a little awkward when they finally let go of each other, and Sanji sounds odd when he says, \u201cyou lost a lot of blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro blinks. \u201cYeah, no shit, cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, shithead, I mean\u2014\u201d Sanji fires back, and damn, Zoro misses this. Misses <em>him</em>. \u201cHe could\u2019ve killed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Zoro points out, because it\u2019s true. \u201cYou stopped him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point\u2014\u201d Sanji begins. Zoro knows where this conversation is going, and he usually wouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to argue with the cook, but. There\u2019s this thing, you see. There\u2019s the meds, for one, but also this thing, this light feeling in his chest that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the stab wound, warming him all over, and it\u2019s kind of stupid how seeing the cook being all <em>Sanji </em>makes him. He doesn\u2019t want to say <em>overwhelmed</em> with feelings, but he kind of <em>is</em>, and Zoro has never been good with lying, especially to himself.</p>\n<p>He knows he doesn\u2019t have it in him to argue with Sanji now, not when his heart is jackrabbiting in his chest like this as Sanji goes on and on about the same old tune, so Zoro does what the little kid always did to him and puts his head on Sanji\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Sanji stops speaking mid-sentence.</p>\n<p>Zoro smiles onto the nape of Sanji\u2019s neck, counting it as a win. He makes himself comfortable and he can feel Sanji melt into him. It used to be difficult, reading Sanji\u2019s body language, because Sanji is full of contradictions and carefully-crafted personas, but after a few months with the little kid, Zoro can read him like a book.</p>\n<p>So he knows. Knows that Sanji is as nervous as he is. Knows the telltales and where to look\u2014the tips of his ears that have turned red, the tightening of his jaw, the way he plays with his hair. But mostly he knows the way Sanji shows his affection, the way he leans into Zoro. Trusts Zoro enough to enter his personal space. Allows him to see a different part of himself.</p>\n<p>He feels safe, Zoro realizes. Sanji makes him feel safe. Sunny has always been home, but it is the kind he has to fight tooth and nail to <em>keep</em> safe. Sanji gives him a different sense of peace, of <em>home</em>, and Zoro thinks he wants to kiss Sanji. So he does.</p>\n<p>Sanji, as always, meets him halfway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">+</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nami and Chopper come by the infirmary in the evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should get some rest, too,\u201d Chopper says to Sanji, who hasn\u2019t left Zoro\u2019s bedside even once. It feels kind of nice, Zoro thinks. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know if there is any prolonged effect from your transformation, so we shouldn\u2019t take any chances.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s face turns a shade darker.</p>\n<p>Chopper reads him all wrong and switches into his mother-hen mode, accusing, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t want to rest.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m going to rest,\u201d Sanji stammers, and Zoro can <em>really</em> get used to the sweep of that blush on his face. \u201cHere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami raises her eyebrow. \u201cOn the infirmary chair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the bed,\u201d Sanji says, and swallows. \u201cWith Zoro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d is all Nami says, because she never takes Sanji\u2019s flirting by heart and knows <em>everything</em>, and she herds Chopper out of the room as she adds, \u201ctry not to pull out any stitches while having sex, or Chopper is going to kill you both.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji sputters an embarrassed <em>Nami-san</em> and Zoro <em>laughs</em>, and he\u2019s probably going to end up pulling all his stitches out, but Sanji is beside him, warm and safe, and he thinks, <em>yeah. This is good</em>.\u00a0</p>"
