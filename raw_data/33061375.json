If you are being held at gunpoint and told to take this class, choose death instead. I promise it will be the better option.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Gojo Satoru is, without a doubt, the worst professor at Jujutsu Tech. HE DOES NOT EXPLAIN A SINGLE THING and expects you to already know high-level concepts such as the Schwarzchild metric, Hawking radiation, and gravitational lensing. His presentation slides have so many memes that they\u2019re practically incomprehensible. Good luck taking notes. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You won\u2019t learn about astrophysics, but Professor Gojo WILL keep you past scheduled class time to talk about his husband.

The fact that someone actually married this heathen is astounding. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>127 likes \u2022 0 dislikes</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobara ends up in PHYS 161 the same way injured animals end up in the zoo: feral, on her last legs, and desperate to escape. Her major (Fashion Merchandising and Design) requires her to take one upper-division science class. PHYS 161 is the last class that has seats available this late in the semester because of one reason and one reason only. </p>\n<p>No one wants to be in a class taught by Professor Gojo Satoru. </p>\n<p>On the outside, Professor Gojo is everything a student could ask for. At age eighteen, he was the youngest person to ever obtain a Nobel Prize in Physics. Now, at age twenty-eight, <em>three</em> Nobel Prizes decorate his bookcases \u2014 making him the only three time recipient of the esteemed title. Gojo Satoru\u2019s research in black holes revolutionized the field of astrophysics, allowing his name to be published alongside those such as Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. His accolades shine radiantly, flickering like false gold. </p>\n<p>But this is Nobara\u2019s second year at Jujutsu Technical College. She is not so easily fooled. </p>\n<p>Bright-eyed, bushy-tailed first years, eager to learn and drawn by the glamor of Gojo\u2019s accomplishments, quickly discover the truth: </p>\n<p>Professor Gojo\u2019s mastery over physics is heavily outweighed by his abhorrent teaching style. </p>\n<p>Rate My Professor \u2014 a website dedicated to helping college students decide which professors to choose and which class to attend\u2014 is a place where Professor Gojo\u2019s unique traits are brought to court by a panel of angry students. Currently, he boasts the lowest overall score on the entire website: a meager 1.4 out of 5. According to the criticism of hundreds, it is a score he has very much earned. A reflection of his abysmal grades, lectures, and class structure. </p>\n<p>On the first day of class, he hands out the PHYS 161: Astrophysics syllabus. It contains no information on tests, grading scales, or extra credit, and is instead a modeling portfolio of himself. Half of the class drops. Nobara manages to keep her scream entirely internal. </p>\n<p>On the second day, he gives lecture. Nobara discovers that notes are given in meme format, learns a revolting amount of information about Gojo\u2019s husband, and witnesses every student that is not required to take this class leave midway through.</p>\n<p><em>Lucky bastards</em>, she thinks, scowling as she tries to draw the mathematical formula shaped as the grumpy cat meme accurately in her notebook.</p>\n<p>On the third day, they are given a pop quiz, which consists of questions such as: </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHow did Professor Gojo meet his absolute wonderful and stunning husband?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat did Professor Gojo cook on his fifth anniversary? List the ingredients and recipe in correct order.\u201d</em> </p>\n<p>And, <em>\u201cMake a dimensional analysis of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium using a polytropic equation of state to find a general mass-radius relation for spherically symmetric, self-gravitating bodies. For which two polytropic indices is the configuration unstable?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Nobara watches as three people formally draft their intention for withdrawal and drop out of Jujutsu Technical College by the time the testing period ends. </p>\n<p>On the fourth day, when the quiz is returned, Nobara considers homicide. The 33%, written in sparkling pink gel pen and covered in poorly drawn flowers, gives rise to an anger so powerful that she snaps her pencil in half. Her vision, briefly, goes red. </p>\n<p>But murdering Gojo is not an option. She cannot achieve her dreams of becoming an influencer from prison. They don\u2019t allow phones. </p>\n<p>Nobara must survive. </p>\n<p>Even worse, Nobara must pass. </p>\n<p>And there\u2019s only one way to do so. </p>\n<p>Every year, there\u2019s a very specific question included on the final. Answering correctly guarantees an A+ in the class. </p>\n<p>\n<em>Who is Professor Gojo\u2019s husband?</em>\n</p>\n<p>No student, in Gojo\u2019s Satoru\u2019s ten years of teaching, has managed to figure out the answer. </p>\n<p>Nobara\u2019s determined to be the first. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>PHYS 161</b><br>\n<em>Rating: 2/5</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Asks for questions and then insults you for 30 minutes. I went to office hours for help and he laughed in my face. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>However, I try to be optimistic about all my classes and so it must be said: Professor Gojo is incredibly good looking, and it makes class somewhat worth taking. One time, he joked that my boyfriend was cheating on me and we broke up the next day :/</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>68 likes \u2022 0 dislikes</em> </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Gojo\u2019s husband?\u201d Junpei asks, wiping down the espresso machine. \u201cSorry, I have no idea who it is.\u201d </p>\n<p>Nobara crushes the empty coffee cup in her hands as if she\u2019s imagining it\u2019s Gojo\u2019s head, anger so palpable that Junpei can almost feel it bubbling off her skin. </p>\n<p>Earlier today, she had stormed into her shift with a twenty percent on the midterm, a grade that was decidedly not passing, but apparently higher than average. Junpei has never taken a class by Professor Gojo, and after almost a semester of hearing Nobara\u2019s horror stories, he\u2019s sure he never will. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo one else does either,\u201d she says venomously. \u201cHow could <em>anyone</em> marry that man?\u201d </p>\n<p>Junpei mulls over the question for a second, but there\u2019s really only one answer. \u201cI guess they must really love each other,\u201d he says, but he grimaces as soon as the words leave his mouth. </p>\n<p>The thought of Professor Gojo doing anything that can be classified as romance is horrifying in its own way. </p>\n<p>Nobara mirrors his expression, disgust written all over her face. She quickly steers the conversation back to their previous topic. \u201cI know it has to be another professor,\u201d she says, moving from the tables to the pastry display. \u201cBecause he\u2019s said that they both teach here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Junpei agrees, filtering through his memories for his brief encounters with Gojo. \u201cHe orders two large drinks every morning. I doubt he could drink all of it by himself.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does he order?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cA strawberry frappuccino with five pumps of syrup, two shots of vanilla,\u201d Junpei recites, remembering the first time he had accidentally made it with four pumps of syrup instead of five. Gojo had complained that it wasn\u2019t sweet, even though the drink was already sugary enough to give the average person a heart attack three times over. \u201cExtra caramel, extra strawberry, chocolate chips\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell is he still alive\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014 And extra whip cream,\u201d Junpei finishes. \u201cAnd also a plain black coffee. I assume that\u2019s for his husband.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe strawberry frappuccino sounds sickening,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if Gojo\u2019s drink has anything to say about his appearance, then I bet his husband is just like black coffee: tall, dark, and handsome.\u201d </p>\n<p>Junpei tries to think of a professor that fits the description. There is one that comes to mind, but the thought is so absurd that he almost brushes it away. It\u2019s only after his second sweep of general college trivia that it swings back around. \u201cProfessor Getou sort of fits\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Getou? The philosophy professor?\u201d Nobara raises an eyebrow curiously, wordlessly handing him a bag of coffee beans. \u201cI thought they hated each other.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they do,\u201d he agrees, putting the coffee beans into the coffee grinder. \u201cWhen we were learning the trolley problem, Professor Getou photoshopped Professor Gojo\u2019s face onto the people being run over. I just can\u2019t think of anyone else.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe they <em>want</em> us to think that they hate each other,\u201d Nobara exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect diversion tactic!\u201d </p>\n<p>It seems really far fetched, but he honestly doesn\u2019t have any better ideas, so he might as well go along with it. \u201cI guess.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI need to be sure before I answer the question,\u201d Nobara says, seemingly lost in thought. She turns to him, eyes flashing dangerously and voice covered in syrup. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me find out, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hesitates. </p>\n<p>On one hand, Junpei is failing biology. The only romance he should be concerned about is the mating rituals of the bowerbird. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, he knows that Nobara takes Taekwondo in her free time and has a hobby of collecting blackmail material on their mutual friends. He doesn\u2019t want to be on her bad side. </p>\n<p>Glancing again at the destroyed coffee cup, torn to pieces and resembling the chew toy of a particularly rabid dog, Junpei makes his decision. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>PHYS 161</b><br>\n<em>Rating: 2/5</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Why would anyone marry Professor Gojo, you ask? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Allow me present to you the following theory:</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Professor Gojo\u2019s husband is in witness protection. He\u2019s on the run, he\u2019s in debt, and there\u2019s dangerous people that want his head on a platter. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The solution? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Adopt a new identity, marry Professor Gojo so that he can change his last name, and integrate himself back into normal civilian life to escape from Tokyo\u2019s dark underbelly.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I know it\u2019s insane. But honestly, I can\u2019t think of any other scenario in which someone would want to spend the rest of their lives with Professor Gojo. </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>46 likes \u2022 0 dislikes</em> </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fushigoro can feel Junpei staring at him from across the library table, peering to the side of the stack of textbooks he\u2019s put in front of him. He knows the next sentence Junpei says is going to be off topic before he even opens his mouth. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known Professor Gojo for a long time,\u201d Junpei begins. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he groans, trying to finish copying his anatomy notes. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Junpei says. He does look slightly apologetic, the same way people do when asking someone else to recall an unpleasant experience such as eating a lemon, but also doesn\u2019t look apologetic enough to let the topic change despite Fushigoro\u2019s discomfort. \u201cHe\u2019s married to Professor Getou right?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Fushigoro frowns. That means that he will have to remove Getou from his list of respectable professors and won\u2019t be able to take any of his classes. Which is a shame because he was looking forward to taking philosophy next year. </p>\n<p>Gojo is married to Getou. He writes the information down in the top corner of his notebook as a reminder to change his schedule. </p>\n<p>Junpei shrugs, opening up a borrowed textbook. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but Nobara thinks they are. I\u2019m trying to help her figure it out.\u201d </p>\n<p>So it was just guessing then. He tries to erase the reminder and notices that he\u2019d written it in non-erasable pen, so he settles for crossing a line through it. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid she blackmail you?\u201d Fushigoro has been on the losing end of that deal many times. Telling her about his crush on Itadori was one of his biggest mistakes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI think the only reason she hasn\u2019t is because I don\u2019t have social media,\u201d Junpei says. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t found anything yet.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t found the answer from Gojo\u2019s social media,\u201d Fushigoro says, just as a text message from Nanako pops up on his phone. It\u2019s a screenshot of Gojo\u2019s latest tweet: a picture of him modeling the latest <em>Versace Renewed Love</em> line, captioned <em>\u2018felt cute, might delete later\u2019</em>. </p>\n<p>Nanako\u2019s text just below reads: <em>In case you forgot, you owe me a shopping trip.</em> </p>\n<p>His default response to Gojo\u2019s tweets is a mild irritation, equivalent to a singular ant crawling on his skin. Nanako only sends him screenshots when she wants to annoy him, so Fushigoro types out an agreement before he\u2019s hit with more spam. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways,\u201d Junpei says, \u201cWould you mind explaining the mating rituals of bowerbirds again?\u201d </p>\n<p>He nods, perusing the stack of textbooks until he finds the right one. \u201cBowerbirds,\u201d Fushigoro explains, flipping to a photograph of a bird hoarding shiny pebbles, \u201clike to decorate their nest with sticks and brightly colored objects to attract a mate.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI bet that\u2019s how Gojo got his husband.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBy collecting shiny rocks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Junpei laughs. \u201cBy bribing him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Fushigoro says wryly. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough money in the world for that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>PHYS 161</b><br>\n<em>Rating: 1/5</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I literally saw him steal candy from a baby???????</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>92 likes \u2022 0 dislikes</em> </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell the difference,\u201d Fushigoro says. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s colorblind, because Nanako can\u2019t even begin to fathom how the two pieces of clothing look anything alike. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis one,\u201d Nanako points to the sweater on the right, \u201cis lilac.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this one,\u201d she gestures to the sweater on the left. \u201cis lavender!\u201d </p>\n<p>He looks at them both with an empty stare before saying, with a voice as flat as the Sahara desert, \u201cThey\u2019re the same color.\u201d </p>\n<p>She takes them both back and sighs, hanging the lavender one back on the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s my mistake. I shouldn\u2019t ask you for fashion advice when you have hair like that.\u201d </p>\n<p>He reaches up to touch his hair, confusion flashing across his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my hair?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em>isn\u2019t</em> wrong with your hair?\u201d Nanako counters. Frankly, it looked like someone had accidentally run over a porcupine and then attempted to reshape it back to its original form. \u201cDid you know that you\u2019re blacklisted from the hair salons around here? I tried setting up an appointment but they all said no when they saw a picture of you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve at least asked me first.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI asked Tsumiki and she said you needed one.\u201d Nanako brushes off the comment, browsing the assortment of shirts with a practiced eye. \u201cBesides, you would\u2019ve said no.\u201d </p>\n<p>Fushigoro doesn\u2019t respond, which is practically an admittance of guilt by itself. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see the new Versace line that Gojo was wearing?\u201d She asks, bringing up Gojo because she knows it irks Fushigoro. \u201cI heard that they literally sent it to him because his family owns a large portion of shares in the company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nanako doesn\u2019t really expect Fushigoro to answer, so she\u2019s pleasantly surprised when he does, even though the actual sentence matter steers the conversation in an entirely different direction. </p>\n<p>\u201cNobara thinks he\u2019s married to Professor Getou,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she responds. The idea in and of itself is so ridiculous that it\u2019s not even worth pursuing. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just common sense.\u201d She flicks a hand causally as she hands him another outfit. \u201cEveryone knows that Getou hates Gojo.\u201d </p>\n<p>He still looks doubtful, so she continues. As one of Getou\u2019s most dedicated students, she\u2019s attended every one of his classes and has born witness to the rivalry between the two professors first hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cGetou set up a mock debate with Gojo over utilitarianism once and I swear they were seconds away from strangling each other,\u201d she says. \u201cGojo annoys him too much.\u201d </p>\n<p>Fushigoro processes the information, a wearisome look crossing his face before suggesting, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a loveless marriage.\u201d </p>\n<p>Nanako pauses, considering. </p>\n<p>In a weird, twisted sort of way, it made sense. There was always a strange tension in their arguments that she\u2019d never been able to explain, something that bordered on romance and violence simultaneously. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou might be right,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cWho knew you were so smart?\u201d </p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes from behind the pile of clothing. \u201cI have better grades than you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nanako agrees, flicking at a stray strand of Fushigoro\u2019s hair and takes in the miniature disaster happening on his head. She holds up the sweater, \u201cBut sea urchins don\u2019t have eyes or brains, so sometimes, I wonder.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he grumbles, reaching for his bag as he\u2019s reminded of schoolwork. \u201cCould you pass these notes too Itadori for me?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d She smiles wolfishly as she\u2019s handed the copy. \u201cIf you do a Tiktok dance with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Fushigoro attempts to take the notes back, but Nanako anticipates the move and sidesteps out of the way quickly. \u201cI spent two hours on those!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019ll take five seconds for me to rip them apart,\u201d she sings threateningly, holding them as if she were going to tear the papers to shreds. Fushigoro\u2019s appearance is sure to boost her and Mimiko\u2019s verified account, which currently sits at 999.7K followers. The internet loves dark haired brooding types. </p>\n<p>Besides, she knows that Fushigoro doesn\u2019t have time to re-do his notes. He has a quiz in Marine Biology with professor Amanai tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Conflict wars on Fushigoro\u2019s face, twisting as he weighs the pros and cons. Nanako wiggles the notebook over a nearby trashcan while she waits for his decision. </p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he concedes at last, glaring as if she had just single-handedly caused his life\u2019s biggest regret. </p>\n<p>Nanako grins. She\u2019ll have to start planning for their one million follower celebration. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>PHYS 161</b><br>\n<em>Rating: 1/5</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am 90% sure Professor Gojo has a humiliation kink or something.

She scrolls furiously on the screen. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what I found out.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mimiko perks up and immediately goes over, earrings forgotten. It\u2019s been a long time since there\u2019s been any notable gossip around here. Fushigoro having a crush on Itadori was old news at this point, considering that neither of them had done anything. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Gojo and Getou used to be married,\u201d Nanako says, as if she doesn\u2019t quiet believe it but has some irrefutable proof that it\u2019s the truth. </p>\n<p>Mimiko is in the same boat. Though the two professors had always had a fuzzy relationship \u2014 the majority of the school believed that they were mortal enemies, but a select few thought otherwise \u2014 surely Getou had better options. They weren\u2019t even in the same league. </p>\n<p>To clarify, she presses for more information. \u201cWhat do you mean <em>\u2018used to be\u2019</em>?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThey probably divorced ten years ago,\u201d Nanako explains, pulling up records of Gojo\u2019s old tweets. \u201cLook, he didn\u2019t tweet for an entire <em>week</em>. It probably happened then.\u201d </p>\n<p>She looks at the screen, the time stamp indicating the ten year difference. In 2007, there is an entire week without new posts. </p>\n<p>Gojo tweeted often throughout the course of a day, usually during times when he was suppose to be giving lecture. For him to be silent on social media for an entire week \u2014 something drastic must have happened during that time. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not solid proof of anything, but it\u2019s just enough for Nanako\u2019s theory to be plausible.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Gojo\u2019s married,\u201d Mimiko points out the flaw. \u201cHe talks about his husband all the time during lecture and wears a silver ring on his left hand.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I think Gojo\u2019s been faking it. They broke up years ago and Gojo pretends they\u2019re still together because he\u2019s not over it yet.\u201d </p>\n<p>Pretending to still be married in order to save face is an act that is incredibly petty. Unfortunately, it also seems like something Gojo would do. Mimiko\u2019s time in astrophysics had been half-spent listening to Gojo\u2019s life story, each and every one more outlandish than the last, tales including feats such as: saving an orphan, fighting a shark with his bare hands, and being a target for government assassins. There was no way all of them were true, so it wasn\u2019t that much of a stretch to think he would lie about his husband. </p>\n<p>To add on to the theory, Mimiko proposes an additional detail, \u201cI think Getou got remarried.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Nanako\u2019s eyes grow wider. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook at the earrings on his desk,\u201d she says, pointing at the jewelry. \u201cIt\u2019s too intimate to be a thank you gift from a colleague or student, and it\u2019s far too expensive to be an ordinary gift for a friend.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThose look familiar\u2026\u201d Nanako says. She squints at them before pulling up something on her phone. \u201cI have a picture somewhere\u2026got it!\u201d </p>\n<p>She shows her a picture of Gojo\u2019s latest modeling campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re from the latest Versace Renewed Love collection. So they\u2019re probably\u2014\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014an anniversary present,\u201d Mimiko finishes.</p>\n<p>They grin at each other, both glad that Getou finally has someone that is worthy of his time. </p>\n<p>As if on cue, Professor Getou opens the door. He glances at them and, noting the upward slant on their faces that are frequently associated with mischief, asks, \u201cDo I want to know?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d Nanako chirps. \u201cJust glad that the marriage is going well, Professor.\u201d </p>\n<p>A flicker of surprise crosses his face. Then, it eases into a relaxed smile. \u201cThank you Nanako,\u201d he says, crossing the room and putting his papers to the side, picking up the box of earrings with a small laugh. \u201cWas this what gave it away?\u201d </p>\n<p>Mimiko and Nanako nod in unison. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it was bound to come out eventually. I\u2019m surprised this whole facade lasted this long to be honest.\u201d Getou stashes the box away and extracts a folder filled with what Mimiko recognizes as their end-of-the-quarter essays. \u201cGive me a second to organize and we can discuss your grades after.\u201d </p>\n<p>As Getou sorts his documents, Nanako fishes out a notebook from her bag. \u201cCan you give this to Itadori? It\u2019s from Megumi.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Mimiko says, transferring it to her backpack. She hopes Fushigoro knows that she will be doodling hearts around every word. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>PHYS 161</b><br>\n<em>Rating: 3/5</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m not in Professor Gojo\u2019s class, but he burst into Anatomy 101 with Professor Shoko during our women\u2019s reproduction unit.

He\u2019s currently on the verge of failing Professor Shoko\u2019s anatomy class.

He is 99% certain that Sukuna would not be caught. </p>\n<p>Itadori opens the notebook as he attempts to memorize the words like the gospel, and stops when he sees a scribbled out note in the top left corner. He reads aloud, \u201cGojo is married to Getou?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s false,\u201d Mimiko corrects, waving a hand as if to dissipate his confusion. \u201cGojo isn\u2019t actually married, he\u2019s just pretending he is so he can save face.\u201d </p>\n<p>Itadori has never had either of these professors and feels like he is missing some vital context. \u201cUm\u2026okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGetou is married though,\u201d she continues, clarifying something that does not need to be clarified. \u201cHe got an early anniversary gift today.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGood for him?\u201d He asks uncertainly, still unsure of how to proceed with this conversation. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt is good for him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She asks, seemingly very happy about this turn of events. \u201cGetou deserves better.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Itadori says, knowing that arguing with Mimiko on any topic regarding Professor Getou was a losing battle. </p>\n<p>Mimiko looks satisfied with his agreement. Then she says, \u201cAre you ready for the test today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Itadori feels a shiver run down his spine at the word test, the ghost of death\u2019s scythe across his neck as Professor Shoko walks into the room. She\u2019s holding something that looks suspiciously like multiple choice bubble sheets. His voice shakes ever so slightly when he asks, \u201cWhat test?\u201d</p>\n<p>The look of pity Mimiko gives him is answer enough. </p>\n<p>Itadori wonders if he has time to write his will before Sukuna finds him. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>PHYS 161</b><br>\n<em>Rating: 1/5</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I tried to sue this professor for emotional distress but it turns out he has tenure.

Itadori has had two 24-hour energy drinks in the span of an hour and can feel his brain beginning to sputter like an abandoned car running on low gas. While Fushigoro\u2019s notes were normally spotless, these ones were the exception. A colorful array of hearts decorated every sentence. It was hard to read. </p>\n<p>His current situation limits his choices down to two potential courses of action. Option 1: He will fail and Sukuna will kill him. Option 2: He will pass and the amount of caffeine he has consumed will stop his heart. </p>\n<p>Itadori decides that the second option will have less suffering. He reaches for his third energy drink. </p>\n<p>Across from him, Nobara is holding profiles for every member of the faculty. Itadori has no idea how this constitutes as studying. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Professor Getou,\u201d Nobara declares, staring down at the papers. \u201cNo one else makes sense.\u201d </p>\n<p>As always, procrastination wins out against good study habits.
