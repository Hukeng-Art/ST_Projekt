Now, the collateral damage of said ideas is ordinarily borne by Kirishima, Sero, and Mina, because they\u2019re Kaminari\u2019s best friends and generally willing at any time to throw themselves headfirst into any and all dangerous, harebrained shenanigans.</p>\n<p>This time, however, is different.</p>\n<p>This time, Kaminari walks up to Todoroki in the hallway after class and says, \u201cDude, I need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki checks over his shoulder, twice, to verify that Kaminari is indeed talking to him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYesterday you asked Shinsou-kun if he was Aizawa-sensei\u2019s son,\u201d Kaminari says, as though that explains anything at all.</p>\n<p>\u201c...yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake a hero conspiracy YouTube channel with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki blinks. Then he blinks again. When he opens his eyes, Kaminari is still standing there and his smile hasn\u2019t given an inch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari shrugs casually, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cYou just seem like you\u2019re into that kind of thing! And I think it\u2019d be fun! So what do ya say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki is silent for a long moment, until Kaminari starts to fidget slightly. Then he nods, once, and says, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari fist-pumps. \u201cHell yeah! You\u2019re not gonna regret this, dude. Come on, I need to tell you some ideas I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki, still not entirely sure what\u2019s happening, follows.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I was thinking for our first episode we could do one of the top ten! That\u2019d net us more attention, and everybody already knows who they are anyways. Uh, probably not Endeavor. But like, Best Jeanist? He\u2019s pretty weird. I think maybe he\u2019s got a mustache, and that\u2019s why his turtleneck is pulled up all the way past his nose. Then when he\u2019s out of costume, people won\u2019t recognize him. I bet it\u2019s a <em>bad</em> mustache, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Todoroki says when Kaminari pauses for breath. \u201cWhat makes you sure he has a mouth at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari slowly turns to look at him, and whispers to himself, slightly awed, \u201cThis was the best idea ever.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p>The borrowed camera switches on, focusing on two boys sitting on a couch. The one on the left is blonde-haired and practically bouncing with excitement, while the other has mismatched eyes, a stoic expression, and a jumble of papers on his lap.</p>\n<p>\n<em>hey! hello! i\u2019m kaminari!</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>i\u2019m todoroki</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>and this is the first episode of hero theory!!!</em><br>\n<em>the way it works is basically, my hella smart friend here will explain some wild theories about the pro heroes we all love and look up to<br>\nand i\u2019ll react and like chime in and stuff!</em></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>suddenly it sounds like i\u2019m doing more work here</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>too late! you already agreed to this</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>i did and that was my mistake<br>\nalright, so today we\u2019re talking-</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>theorizing!<br>\nmakes us sound smarter</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>THEORIZING about the current number three hero, Best Jeanist, and what exactly is under his\u2026 neck. turtleneck.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>jurtleneck</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>no</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p>They post the first video the same day they film it, with minimal editing because neither of them really knows how to do that. Kaminari holds up a hand for a high five, which Todoroki returns with some hesitation and a few moments of confused squinting, and then they press the upload button together.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t really expect much.</p>\n<p>When he wakes up the next morning, Todoroki\u2019s email inbox is full of comments and subscription notifications. Not an overwhelming number, but far more than the amount he had expected (which was zero).</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p><b>Hero Theory Episode 1: What Does Best Jeanist Really Look Like?</b><br>\n1,034 views</p>\n<p>Comments \u2022 21</p>\n<p><b>Mico Nico</b><br>\nHoly shit these kids are hilarious</p>\n<p><b>Sketching</b><br>\nisn\u2019t that endeavor\u2019s son?? from the sports festival? i didn\u2019t know he could look excited</p>\n<p><b>Tara Wonder</b><br>\nOk but THEYRE NOT WRONG how do we KNOW he has a mouth</p>\n<p><b>All Star</b><br>\nmeh, production quality\u2019s crap but the idea\u2019s solid</p>\n<p><b>Paxxxton</b><br>\nim lmao @ todoroki\u2019s face every time kaminari calls jeanist\u2019s hero costume \u2018the jostume\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p>Todoroki is just finishing rereading the comments for the third time when Kaminari\u2019s practically breaking down his door, yelling in incoherent excitement. Todoroki lets him in before he can wake up Bakugou next door and cause an incident, and they go over the comments together, making note of the criticisms. They\u2019re both smiling, Kaminari huge and bright and Todoroki small and proud.</p>\n<p>Todoroki starts writing actual scripts, outlining the episode so he doesn\u2019t get distracted or lose his place. Kaminari visits Present Mic after class to ask for lessons in video editing. Jirou commandeers her camera back to film for them, and starts teaching them about lens options and audio settings.</p>\n<p>The next day, Aizawa-sensei is collecting worksheets when he blinks down at the back of one, seemingly nonplussed, and says, \u201cTodoroki.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki looks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this list on the back of your homework?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrainstorming,\u201d Todoroki says.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cAn extracurricular project.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of extracurricular project would produce the words \u2018Mount Lady is actually giant and her quirk is shrinking down to normal size?\u2019\u201d Aizawa-sensei asks, his voice totally flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dude, that\u2019s a great one!\u201d Kaminari exclaims, drawing the attention of the classroom. \u201cWe should do that next.

Other then Jirou, who\u2019s settled into her role as their camerawoman, there\u2019s also Midoriya, whose encyclopedic knowledge of heroes and quirks makes him a common guest expert; Yaoyorozu and Iida, who are always willing to help with research; and Hagakure, who\u2019s happy to be equipped with a Go-Pro and set to work trying to get evidence for various theories.</p>\n<p>Most of the rest of class 1-A makes at least an appearance or two, be it by crossing through the background to get leftovers from the fridge and scowling at the camera (Bakugou) or belly-flopping onto the couch between the two hosts to insert their own opinion (Mina, frequently).</p>\n<p>And slowly, steadily, their subscriber count begins to grow. As word gets around about the series and it increases in quality and popularity, they start getting more views, more likes, more comments. Some of them are trolls or spam, but the vast majority are genuine praise.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s not exactly sure just how it happens, but before long he\u2019s the writer and co-host for one of the fastest-growing new shows on YouTube. He\u2019s also suddenly friends with Kaminari, and he\u2019s not quite sure how that happened, either.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s definitely not complaining.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p><b>Hero Theory Episode 9: What Species is UA\u2019s Principal Nedzu?</b><br>\n41,567 views</p>\n<p>Comments \u2022 291</p>\n<p><b>Pterror</b><br>\nokay but did you see that wink at the go pro at 5:66? nedzu definitely knew they were filming him im Afraid</p>\n<p><b>Take On Me</b><br>\nI love how they say Midoriya\u2019s a guest star but really Todoroki just drags him over to the couch, gives him a topic and just lets him run.</p>\n<p><b>Free Bird</b><br>\nI think he\u2019s a rat?

The camera pans slightly to one side to show Todoroki, who activates his quirk to create a snowball in his right hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d Kaminari whispers from behind the camera. Todoroki nods once, expression tight. Kaminari yells, \u201cTHINK FAST!\u201d as Todoroki throws the snowball, aiming directly at Ectoplasm\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Ectoplasm\u2019s head jerks up at the shout and he launches himself into a leap, spinning around in midair and smashing the snowball to power with one peg leg. Kaminari makes a strangled sound as the teacher, clearly annoyed and lightly dusted with snow, glares directly at the camera. He grabs Todoroki\u2019s arm and starts backing down the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbort mission, abort mission, run run run run-\u201c</p>\n<p>The footage ends there, switching back to the familiar sight of the two boys on the couch, obviously filmed on a later date than the first segment.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>i told you it wouldn\u2019t work</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>it was worth a try!!</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>was it worth the week of lunch detention?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>absolutely, dude. </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p><b>Amilie Red</b> @houseofarms<br>\nthe real reason todoroki and kaminari from hero theory r so good at their job: their homeroom teacher is a certified cryptid</p>\n<p><b>Shalyssa</b> @itsyagirllyssa<br>\nyaoyorozu appearing in the latest episode of hero theory solely to roast uwabami for being anti-feminist cleared my skin, watered my crops,</p>\n<p><b>Five Plastic Dinosaurs</b> @katitulips<br>\ni relate to todoroki shouto bc i too am an antisocial mess constantly being dragged into dumb shit by an extroverted friend</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p>The idea for episode twenty comes, of all places, from Midoriya. He catches Todoroki\u2019s attention one day during lunch, and says, \u201cHave you ever thought about researching any older heroes for your show? Like from the Silver Age?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki admits. His knowledge of heroes is extensive, but it\u2019s limited to those that are currently active or very recently retired. Endeavor never saw any use in teaching him about dead or long-retired heroes who would never pose a threat to him, which means he barely knows anything about any heroes from before the time of All Might beyond what\u2019s taught in history class. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea, though. Do you have one in mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Midoriya says, without a moment of hesitation, \u201cNana Shimura.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s harder to research than the other episodes, even with Midoriya\u2019s pre-existing knowledge to draw from. Nana Shimura is from before heroes were widely monitored and registered, so most information about her is vague, but Todoroki recruits Yaoyorozu to help him and Midoriya search, and little by little they build a story.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quite a story.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p>\n<em>hey hey guys! as you all know, i\u2019m kaminari</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>and i\u2019m todoroki</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>and this is episode 20- holy shit- of hero theory!!</em><br>\n<em>we\u2019ve got a surprise for you guys today! a deep dive into the age of heroes past!<br>\ntodoroki, you wanna explain?</em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>right. today we\u2019re talking about a lesser-known heroine from the silver age</em><br>\n<em>it\u2019s important to learn not just about the heroes who are active today, but also those that came before<br>\nso today we\u2019re telling you the story of a woman named nana shimura, hero name adamant</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>hell yeah!! and let me tell you guys, this lady was a certified, grade a badass<br>\nshe could beat me up and i wouldn\u2019t even be mad</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>lots of people could beat you up, though<br>\ndidn\u2019t ojiro kick your ass in training this morning?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>don\u2019t expose me like this, dude</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>it\u2019s what i\u2019m here for</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>yeah i know<br>\nANYWAYS!!

As soon as she hits the last, Kaminari breaks out into a beaming grin. \u201cHey guys! So, Hero Theory is going to be a little different today. There was a lot of demand on it for Twitter, especially after the last episode, so we\u2019re doing a Q&amp;A thing to celebrate hitting a hundred thousand subscribers!\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki nods. He looks a little more downcast and anxious than he usually does, not quite making eye contact with the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you have a question, remember to submit it on Twitter under the hashtag #HTQA! Asshole questions will be smited with the fury of a thousand suns and one point three million volts!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSmote.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPast tense of smite is smote,\u201d Todoroki clarifies.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, then asshole questions will be <em>smote</em>. Let\u2019s get this started!\u201d Kaminari pulls out his phone and starts scrolling through the tag. \u201cFirst question! One I\u2019ve been asking for ages. Todoroki. Dude. Why don\u2019t you have a Twitter yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need one,\u201d Todoroki says, like it\u2019s obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying,\u201d Kaminari confides in an aside to the camera. \u201cDude\u2019s intent on being a social media ghost. Second question: \u2018are you two dating?\u2019 Tragically, no. He\u2019s hot, and I know, anybody would be lucky to have me, but Todoroki\u2019s already got a cru-\u201d</p>\n<p>The last word is abruptly cut off into a stifled yell when he takes a couch pillow hard to the face. Todoroki, holding the pillow over Kaminari\u2019s mouth with one hand, steals his phone with the other and scrolls through the next few questions while ignoring his co-host\u2019s muffled complaints.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Will you ever do theories on your classmates?\u2019\u201d he reads. \u201cMaybe, but probably not. We already know them very well, and the hero license exam revealed that we place ourselves at a disadvantage if we release too much information about ourselves.\u201d He scrolls down to the next question, and reads it\u00a0silently with raised eyebrows before staring flatly into the camera. \"Keep your questions appropriate.\"</p>\n<p>Kaminari finally succeeds in shoving free of the pillow a few questions later, and seizes his phone back, settling into his seat again. \u201c\u2018Where did the idea for the Adamant episode come from?\u2019 I actually don\u2019t know. Todoroki?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one was Midoriya\u2019s idea. Apparently he was a big fan of hers and wanted her to get more recognition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice. \u2018Who\u2019s your cameraman?\u2019 Camerawoman, actually. Say hi, Jirou!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jirou says, sounding bemused. A hand wearing chipped black nail polish appears in the shot, flashing a peace sign at the audience. Todoroki gives her a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Question for both of you,\u2019\u201d Kaminari continues. \u201c\u2018which episode was your favorite?\u2019 Oh, uh, I was really proud of the Thirteen episode. We had a whole ton of nonbinary folks commenting to tell us they were happy with the way we handled all the theorizing about their gender! That was great!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Adamant episode was mine,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cIt was harder to research, but it felt good to see a less glorified hero get the recognition she deserved.\u201d He pauses, then adds, \u201cPersonally, though, I got the most satisfaction out of the Endeavor episode.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari grins at that, before moving on to the next question. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you guys have a Discord server?\u2019 We should <em>absolutely</em> have a Discord server. That\u2019s such a good idea. I\u2019m making one as soon as we\u2019re done with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext question! This one\u2019s for Todoroki too. Let me know if you\u2019re not comfortable answering this, dude. \u2018Why\u2019d you decide to make the Endeavor episode?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki is quiet for a long moment before he answers, measuring his words. \u201cBecause\u2026 it\u2019s important that people understand what sort of person he is. Even if he\u2019s trying to be better now, and do better.\u201d He shrugs a little. \u201cAfter the Adamant episode proved that our show could actually have an impact, it just felt right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood answer, dude,\u201d Kaminari says. \u201c\u2018How did you get the idea to start this show?\u2019 <em>This</em> one I can answer. Okay, so one of our classmates, Shinsou, you guys know him, he showed up in one of our episodes when we were talking about, uh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNegative quirk stigma,\u201d Todoroki says.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, that. So he\u2019s got kind of crazy hair and looks tired all the time, and <em>Aizawa-sensei</em> has crazy hair and looks tired all the time, so on the first day after Shinsou joined our class-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this necessary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep!\u201d Kaminari answers, sounding absolutely delighted. \u201cOn the first day after Shinsou joined our class, Todoroki walked up to him and asked him, to his face, if he was secretly Aizawa-sensei\u2019s secret love child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that unreasonable,\u201d Todoroki mutters, looking away from the camera. \u201cAizawa-sensei was privately training him to get him into the hero course, and gave him a version of his capture weapon too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I saw this go down, and my immediate thought was, of course, dude, that guy would be a perfect co-host for a show about hero conspiracy theories.\u201d Kaminari grinned widely, and hooked an arm around Todoroki\u2019s shoulders, pulling him into a one-armed hug. \u201cAnd look, I was right!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay, man?\u201d Kaminari asks, after they finish filming. He sounds uncharacteristically cautious when he says it.</p>\n<p>Todoroki has to think about it for a moment. He nods. \u201cYeah, I think I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Kaminari holds his hand up for a high five this time, Todoroki doesn\u2019t hesitate.</p>\n<p>\n<em>hey hey everybody! kaminari here!</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>and i\u2019m todoroki</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>and this is episode 25 of hero theory! lucky number 25!</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>that\u2019s not a thing</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>sure it is</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>25\u2019s not lucky</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>how do you KNOW, though</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>it\u2019s just not?

Once the show explodes in popularity, she and Sero develop a habit of ambushing Todoroki to suggest ideas. After the third time Todoroki very nearly sets them on fire, he gives up and yanks a piece of tape from Sero\u2019s elbow to stick a sheet of notebook paper to their classroom wall.</p>\n<p>For a time, the suggestion sheet serves as an anonymous idea dump for anybody in Class 1-A. Sooner or later, however, knowledge of it spreads to the rest of UA\u2019s student body.</p>\n<p><em>'Why Class 1-B is definitively better than the 1-A idiots'</em> has shown up more than once, so Monoma, at least, definitely knows about it.</p>\n<p>Most of the ideas on the sheet are usually nonsense even by the show\u2019s spectacularly low standards, but Todoroki makes a point of checking the sheet every day after class regardless. Sometimes they have potential.</p>\n<p>When he checks the list on Thursday, this is what it says:</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Todoroki says.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>Hero Theory Episode 26: Why Is UA\u2019s Class 1B Better Than Class 1A?</strong><br>\n201,294 views</p>\n<p>Comments \u2022 1,032</p>\n<p><strong>Lemonlion</strong><br>\ndid i<br>\ndid i seriously just get rickrolled in the year of our lord 2197</p>\n<p><strong>Facepalm</strong><br>\nit really does loop for the whole twenty-six minutes if you were wondering</p>\n<p><strong>\u30b8\u30e8\u30ea\u30f3</strong><br>\nI\u2019m not sure if I want to high five Kaminari or punch him in the face</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to get Bakugou on the show more, man,\u201d Kaminari declares with no prelude, kicking Todoroki\u2019s door down and tossing himself onto his bed.

Todoroki and Kaminari are admins, while Jirou, Midoriya, Kirishima and Yaoyorozu get made moderators.</p>\n<p>Todoroki mostly lurks on invisible mode, and inserts his opinion into conversations whenever it\u2019s least expected, while Kaminari enthusiastically and constantly hypes up whatever the next episode will be, runs polls, and is generally a ray of hyperactive sunshine.</p>\n<p>The suggestion sheet stays up on the classroom wall, of course, but now they have a constant stream of video ideas from the public as well. Most of the ideas are a bit too crazy even for them, Todoroki starts keeping a list on his phone of the good ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kaminari says one day, while hanging upside down off of his bed, squinting at the results of the latest community poll on his phone. \u201cPeople really want more villain episodes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm?\u201d Todoroki asks, glancing up from his English homework.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! Like, yesterday I asked the server what their favorite episodes were, and the Adamant and Endeavor episodes were right up there at the top, but like the next two after that were the ones we did on Stain and Dabi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the Dabi episode was popular because he\u2019s a villain,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThat was because it actually turned out to be true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>PETITION: ADD NANA SHIMURA TO THE NATIONAL HEROISM MEMORIAL</strong><br>\n500,000/500,000 signatures received</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>The petition is posted anonymously online. As soon as he finds out about it, Kaminari shares it on Twitter and announces it on the Discord server, and it reaches the signature goal almost overnight.</p>\n<p>All Might gives a speech at the unveiling of the amended monument in the center of Tokyo, and all of Class 1-A crowds together in the common room to watch it on live TV, stacked on top of each other so they can all see the live feed. Yaoyorozu holds out an arm to generate a constant supply of tissues for Midoriya, who\u2019s a weeping mess.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>one of our most popular episodes ever was our feature on adamant, aka nana shimura</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>and hey shout out to everybody who signed the petition!
