  "summary": "<p>The Kim family's debt to the Yoo family was insurmountable. The only way they could pay off the debt was to offer their only son as collateral, to act as a shield to the current Yoo family head to ward off suitors. With the understanding that the sole child could not have his dearest wish of a warm and happy future, he could only strive to have others take that place instead.</p>\n<p>But in the end, happy endings do exist.</p>",

  "text": "<p>The veil was pulled back, revealing the pale face underneath. Kim Dokja peered back at the taller man as a sort of reflex to his face being exposed, but Yoo Joonghyuk merely glanced at his soon-to-be wife\u2019s face before looking back at the priest indifferently. The priest at the altar continued with the ceremony as if nothing happened, uttering the vows in a low voice. The cathedral was bare of living souls, save for the few servants of the Yoo family to bear witness. Kim Dokja had brought no one. His father was too cheap to give him any servants.</p>\n<p>The veil was removed. Kim Dokja slowly turned around as thin hands took off the bridal choker, exposing his pale neck, free from marks. He leaned slightly forward, allowing better access for the groom to come forward.</p>\n<p>The grip on his shoulders was crushing. Pain registered at the back of his neck. Kim Dokja bit his lip to hold back his grimace as the teeth sunk into his skin. Kim Dokja had always imagined that being claimed by an alpha would be both an interesting and wonderful experience, but he realized that had been nothing but childish dreams when the Yoo family came after his family debts. His whole body shuddered as the feeling of being claimed made him feel complete.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was unfortunate that his feelings weren\u2019t the same.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ceremony is now complete,\u201d the priest confirmed. \u201cMay the couple remain together for this life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out his handkerchief to wipe away the excess blood from his bite mark, dropped the dirtied cloth into Kim Dokja\u2019s hand, and turned around to exit the cathedral.</p>\n<p>The bride was left at the altar. A shaky sigh left Kim Dokja\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was not truly marriage. Kim Dokja was painfully aware of that fact. He didn\u2019t even receive the Yoo family\u2019s heirloom ring, but a similar copy to it that had a tracking feature. The debts that the Kim family owed were insurmountable, with the only way of saving his parents from ruin was to use their only son as collateral. Yoo Joonghyuk, the current head of the archducal Yoo family, took Kim Dokja as his stand-in wife because he didn\u2019t want to be bothered by other annoying suitors. Yoo Joonghyuk had only agreed to the proposition when he found out that Kim Dokja was an omega.</p>\n<p>But a failure of an omega he was. Due to the lifestyle that his father chose, it left both his wife and son little to use and eat. Kim Dokja grew up with a weak body, and because of his malnourishment, his development as an omega was stunted. It was only when he came to the age of 20 did he start presenting signs of being one. His father disdained him even further.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja was shown to his new room within the Yoo residence. It was separate from Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s, which Kim Dokja was thankful for. The servant behind him bowed slightly before leaving the room, allowing Kim Dokja to observe his surroundings. The wealth of the Yoo family was amazing \u2013 everything that he could see and touch had some sort of incredible value.</p>\n<p>He sank into the soft bed, his anxiety piling up on his tired bones. The bite mark on his neck ached.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From tomorrow onwards, he had to act.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnnouncing the arrival of Archduke Yoo Joonghyuk and Archduchess Kim Dokja!\u201d the servant loudly introduced. The large doors swung open, revealing the couple as they walked forward into the crowd. Gazes pricked Kim Dokja\u2019s skin as they silently made their way across the room to greet the royal family.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk had as many enemies as he had suitors. As the archduke of one of the wealthiest territories, he was second to the royal family in power. Many vied for his attention and his influence, and it was Kim Dokja\u2019s job to fend his female and omega counterparts off.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja smiled at the young lady of a Marquess\u2019 family who came too close to the couple. He wrapped his arm around Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s stiff one, leaning his head to touch against Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s bicep.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid my husband is busy,\u201d Kim Dokja lightly commented, his smile immovable, \u201cyou will have to wait for another time to have a chance with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>The young lady apologized lightly and turned away, but not before glaring at him as if he was a stain in her eyes.</p>\n<p>Most noble families were already aware that Kim Dokja didn\u2019t get his status in the regular fashion. Whispers and gossip behind his back spoke of his family debts and how the head of the Yoo family would soon throw him away when he was of no more use. They could wait for their chance or find a way to backstab him.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja wouldn\u2019t let that happen. The little amount of pride inside of him wouldn\u2019t let them achieve that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Grace, here\u2019s the report,\u201d Shin Yoosung said as she placed the folder onto his desk, \u201cand here is your afternoon tea and treat. The other maids put extra effort into making it, so please eat it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, I will take a pause soon.\u201d Kim Dokja nodded, his hands already flipping through the report. The report in his hand was grabbed by his personal attendant, her expression reading concern, lip trembling.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Alright, I\u2019ll eat now then.\u201d Kim Dokja sighed.</p>\n<p>For some reason, the longer that Kim Dokja lived within the Yoo residence, the more and more of the Yoo family servants warmed up to him. He couldn\u2019t understand what he did to attract their\u2026 loving attention as he did his best to stay out of their way, but he didn\u2019t want to be useless either.</p>\n<p>The years of living with his father had proved to him that reality was cruel. If one did not work, then one did not eat. If Kim Dokja failed to keep Yoo Joonghyuk untouchable, then he most certainly would be kicked out of his residence. He\u2019d have no home, no place to return to, and as a marked omega, no value. The best situation he could think of was living as a prostitute. He could take drugs to relieve the rejection pain.</p>\n<p>The report he received from Shin Yoosung was a daily task. As the stand-in wife, Kim Dokja was supposed to be responsible for financial affairs and other connections. However, Yoo Joonghyuk did not trust his wife, and so he gave him no responsibilities.</p>\n<p>However, his lack of trust in his omega was also his strongest point. Kim Dokja had spent months coaxing the Yoo family servants to slowly bring him reports so that he could provide comment and direction, allowing others to take credit for his work. He wanted to be invisible, just as Yoo Joonghyuk intended.</p>\n<p>The pen in his hand stilled. Aside from mandatory gatherings and checkups, the couple had never been in the same room. Not for eating, not for chatting, not even purely for Kim Dokja to make a silent appearance. Yoo Joonghyuk would only come to see if Kim Dokja was still alive and that he wasn\u2019t doing something behind his back.</p>\n<p>That was fine. The moment the Yoo family demanded he be wedded off, Kim Dokja lost all hope for any sort of affection or future with it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had to do his job right. It was better living here than with his father.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A knock against the window frame distracted Kim Dokja for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he ordered.</p>\n<p>A knight opened the window as she silently slid inside. Within her hands was yet again another report, which covered territorial disputes and trading concerns. Kim Dokja quickly flipped through the papers and told the knight to strengthen the forces at the southern border and to open more markets in the east.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Grace, may I ask why you are doing so much?\u201d Jung Heewon asked in a quiet voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cAssurance.\u201d Kim Dokja gave a wry smile. \u201cIf I happen to fail to act as a proper wife and I\u2019m left to defend myself, I want to at least live somewhere prosperous that won\u2019t end up with me dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll live within the archducal territory.\u201d Jung Heewon\u2019s voice quivered.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja could only give her a soft pat on her armoured hand. \u201cI also want the Yoo family servants to be well, including the knights. If you\u2019re doing well, that means I can do well too, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jung Heewon bit her lip. \u201cYes, your Grace.\u201d she finally spat out.</p>\n<p>The night was long, with only the candle on Kim Dokja\u2019s desk giving warmth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI greet the Archduke Yoo Joonghyuk and the Archduchess Kim Dokja,\u201d Lee Seolhwa bowed gracefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may rise.\u201d Kim Dokja motioned. Lee Seolhwa returned to her elegant posture and offered a soft smile.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja watched his husband from the corner of his eye. Out of all the possible candidates that Kim Dokja had determined, Lee Seolhwa was the best option. Although she was not from a powerful family and was neither alpha nor omega, she was smart and kind, dabbled in medicinal practices, and even knew how to defend herself. If she gained a foothold in this household, the acceptance of her arrival would be quick.</p>\n<p>Besides, she was the only one who could make Yoo Joonghyuk smile, even if it was a small one.</p>\n<p><em>\u2018I have to invite her more often,\u2019</em> Kim Dokja thought to himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cArchduchess, are you feeling well?\u201d Lee Seolhwa asked, her gaze full of concern. Her hand was pressed against Kim Dokja\u2019s wrist, reading his heartbeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m alright, you need not go this far.\u201d Kim Dokja discreetly pulled his hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut from what I understand, you haven\u2019t had a proper heat in years. As an aspiring doctor, how could I not be concerned for the archduchess\u2019 health?\u201d Lee Seolhwa persisted. \u201cI\u2019ll prescribe you some medication. As the archduke\u2019s wife, you must be able to conceive in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja could only offer a polite smile. Since they had married three years ago, Kim Dokja had never once gone into heat. In fact, he only had his first one when he was 21. That was seven years ago.</p>\n<p>Making an infertile omega fertile again was like solving an impossible puzzle.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Kim Dokja said out of courtesy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rumours were already bubbling around noble society that the wife of the archduke was unable to conceive. More and more suitors became proactive in separating the couple.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja sighed. Handling both increasingly difficult suitors and territorial affairs was time consuming and energy draining. He couldn\u2019t rest, not with the sudden report he received from Jung Heewon.</p>\n<p>Others had found out that Yoo Joonghyuk had a special interest in Lee Seolhwa. At this point, she was a threat. The report Kim Dokja just received was not in fact one report, but many pieced together. A whole plot was devised to have Lee Seolhwa vanish.</p>\n<p>As the best candidate to replace him, Kim Dokja wasn\u2019t going to allow that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk furrowed his brows. He had seen the interaction with Kim Dokja with Lee Seolhwa increase. Although it was a bother to have the other woman constantly come to his residence, Yoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t mind it either. In fact, that was the only time he ever saw Kim Dokja with a soft-looking expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What really bothered him was the changing state of his stand-in wife.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Kim Dokja arrived, he was merely skin and bones, evidence of his family\u2019s situation. His servants had to feed him well in order to maintain a healthier glow, but now his omega looked basically the same as he did when he first arrived. It was\u2026 concerning.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk became suspicious of his actions. What was he doing behind his back?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His servants answered him dutifully, but even he could tell now that something wasn\u2019t right. They skirted around certain topics, only offering the words that Yoo Joonghyuk wanted to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me the truth.\u201d the alpha hissed, pen in hand snapped in two. Lee Hyunsung started to sweat as Shin Yoosung fidgeted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you see, your Grace\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Jung Heewon abruptly opened the window, \u201cLady Seolhwa was captured. It is at the location we identified.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring me to her.\u201d Kim Dokja stood up abruptly from his desk.</p>\n<p>It was two in the morning. Kim Dokja could only grab a cloak to cover his body and his bag that he had prepared beforehand. Only Jung Heewon went with him as the two used a teleportation spell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Industrial Complex. It sat at the border of another territory; its underground aspects started crawling towards the Yoo territory. It was a concern that was already on Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s radar, and so patrols there were incredibly tight.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, because the black market was there, that meant that there was always a means of slipping through.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExecute plan E.\u201d Kim Dokja ordered Jung Heewon. Her eyes widened. Plan E was\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but I mustn\u2019t let you go further. Is your allegiance not with the Yoo family?\u201d Kim Dokja interjected before she could speak up. \u201cLet me handle this. As the stand-in archduchess, it is an obligation. To lose the best candidate would impede on the Yoo family name. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tears welled up in Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes. After a long silence, she finally spoke up. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja sent her off before turning towards the brothel. With a mask that he stole, he muttered the password for entry. He ordered a room before using an invisibility spell. It could only last for an hour, but it was plenty of time.</p>\n<p>He slipped through the guards and went underground, biding his time to slip in between doors and wait for passing patrols.</p>\n<p>His quiet footsteps wandered between the cells, his eyes adjusting to the dark.</p>\n<p>Finally, a familiar person came into his view.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Using his knife, Kim Dokja broke the lock. Lee Seolhwa\u2019s head shot up from her slouched position, alarmed by the sudden noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Seolhwa,\u201d Kim Dokja whispered. Lee Seolhwa\u2019s eyes widened.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Gr\u2014\u201d her voice was muffled when Kim Dokja pressed a hand to her mouth. She immediately understood and went silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to rescue you.\u201d Kim Dokja answered. He slipped her a one-time spell as he continued to say, \u201cthis item will give you invisibility for an hour. Stay quiet and we should be able to leave with no problems.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d Lee Seolhwa whispered as she quickly activated the spell. They held hands to confirm their positions.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you are the best candidate to be with the archduke.\u201d Lee Seolhwa could hear the firmness within Kim Dokja\u2019s voice. Lee Seolhwa\u2019s mouth opened and closed, but ultimately, no voice resounded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s eyes snapped open. He suddenly rose from his bed, his eyes darting to the ring on his left pinky. The ring that he wore shone a red glow, and soon a mini-map appeared. A tracking dot surfaced on the map.</p>\n<p>The Industrial Complex? What was Kim Dokja doing there?</p>\n<p>\u201cGuards!\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk yelled as he quickly got up and dressed. His knights soon burst open the door to hear their next orders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are going to the Industrial Complex, <em>now</em>!\u201d he ordered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two got up from the cell. There was only a five-minute interval between patrols, and the guards would notice if they didn\u2019t leave now. They made their way to the door to the basement, waiting for them to notice the empty cell. It\u2019d be the only time this door would be swung open with careless abandon.</p>\n<p>It went as expected. The guards were alarmed, and the door was left open. The two slipped out and ran through the streets, shouts echoing from the brothel.</p>\n<p>The two had just made it to the outskirts of the Industrial Complex when Kim Dokja\u2019s invisibility spell finally died out.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d Kim Dokja cursed. He was so busy following the memorized route that he forgot the timing of his spell. The moment he suddenly appeared in the wilderness, the black market\u2019s guards and patrol were startled by the sudden appearance.</p>\n<p>He pulled Lee Seolhwa along into the forest that bordered a large river. She\u2019d at least be safe here \u2013 he estimated that she still had at least twenty or so minutes left of her invisibility. He slipped off his ring and handed it off to Lee Seolhwa.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Lee Seolhwa\u2019s voice sounded desperate after realizing what he was doing. \u201cYour Grace\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep this with you. Don\u2019t let it go.\u201d Kim Dokja smiled tiredly. His body was truly unfit, most of his energy spent. \u201cOnce the guards have passed, follow the river upstream. You will arrive at the Yoo family patrol unit after fifteen minutes have passed. My guard Jung Heewon will be waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Dokja!!\u201d Lee Seolhwa yelled as Kim Dokja slipped loose. He headed downstream to divert attention.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The black market guards gained on Kim Dokja. His lungs burned, desperate for air, but Kim Dokja continued to push forward. He couldn\u2019t lose out now, not when the river opening was soon to come into view.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s body lurched forward. An arrow had struck his shoulder, causing his already weak body to wobble. He fell face-first into the waters, a dull pain registering on his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk rushed to the location his ring had marked.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja was moving too fast, faster than Yoo Joonghyuk had originally thought, especially for omegas. Instead of the Industrial Complex, the marker was pointed in the direction of the Yoo family\u2019s stationed forces.</p>\n<p>His heart was pounding against his chest as he rushed forward, ignoring the calls of his knights.</p>\n<p>It was only the day before where Lee Hyunsung and Shin Yoosung admitted to what Kim Dokja did behind his back. At first, he was stunned. Kim Dokja gave an external impression that he was prideful and greedy when in reality he was very much a bookworm who liked to stay indoors. The improvements to his territory were made by the slight tweaks of his stand-in wife. All credit to insightful suggestions made at his round table were actually Kim Dokja\u2019s suggestions. All the servants under Kim Dokja were worried about not only his health but his habits. Kim Dokja had even told them to act as if nothing he did mattered so as to not arouse Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s attention. He fit his role too perfectly.</p>\n<p>Not once did Yoo Joonghyuk glance at Kim Dokja meaningfully. How was Yoo Joonghyuk so blind to his care?</p>\n<p>He would demand answers the moment he caught Kim Dokja. Demand why he did so much behind his back, why he was so feverishly looking for someone to replace him, and why he never cared for himself. The time spent with Lee Seolhwa finally clicked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The person who actually appeared before him caused his heart to drop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is he?!\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk shook Lee Seolhwa.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe, he headed downstream to distract the guards. I\u2026 I\u2014\u201d Lee Seolhwa broke down. The ring in her hand was promptly given to Yoo Joonghyuk. \u201cHe left me this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk had never regretted a decision so hard in his life. The alpha\u2019s grip on the ring crushed the tracking gem within it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuards! Mages! Scour the river!\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk yelled, \u201ckill anyone on sight. Find my wife!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s consciousness wavered. Murmurs of voices flitted between his ears, an occasional touch on his hand and forehead giving him the only sense of external forces. His eyes refused to open. His body felt as heavy as lead.</p>\n<p>Was he still alive? How much time had passed?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2026 .. \u2026 condition\u2026 \u2026 .. \u2026. time\u2026 Grace\u2026\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2026 when \u2026\u2026 \u2026 \u2026..\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2026 \u2026. ..\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2026 .. \u2026\u2026 .. busy\u2026. \u2026. .. \u2026 patience\u2026\u2026.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Voices spoke close to his person, but no matter how much he tried to focus, their sentences could not be discerned.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a firm hand gripped his own. It was large, warm, and frighteningly gentle.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s consciousness drifted off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja slowly opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sunlight drifted through the open windows, a soft breeze entering the room as early autumn rolled in. A tray came crashing to the floor. The maid who had just entered left the room, shouting that the archduchess was awake.</p>\n<p>Soon after, Yoo Joonghyuk barged in, out of breath. Kim Dokja blinked his bleary eyes. Yoo Joonghyuk was here?</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk came over in large strides before promptly sitting in the chair next to his bed. His hand pressed against Kim Dokja\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja opened and closed his mouth. When Yoo Joonghyuk realized that he couldn\u2019t speak properly, he grabbed the pitcher and glass placed next to his bed to serve him some water.</p>\n<p>Now Kim Dokja really was dumbfounded. Was he hallucinating?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk slowly fed him water, patiently waiting for Kim Dokja to finish.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you rescue me?\u201d were Kim Dokja\u2019s first words after drinking his fill. He didn\u2019t even know how he survived. He wasn\u2019t expecting it. Plan E did not have a survival option.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are my wife.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk answered immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA stand-in is not a true wife. Only the true wife wears the Yoo family\u2019s heirloom ring, does she not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk fell silent. Kim Dokja\u2019s words were terribly true. He had not given Kim Dokja the heirloom ring.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can still mark others.\u201d Kim Dokja gently reminded him. \u201cI cannot bear children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly interjected, \u201cLady Seolhwa can help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Kim Dokja sighed. Kim Dokja then realized that this was the longest conversation the two ever had since moving here. He prodded, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that she\u2019s the candidate I chose for you when I\u2019m gone. I won\u2019t take her place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was only interested in her for her medicinal prowess.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said between gritted teeth. \u201cThe more medical power we have, the better my territory can do. Our population is at a steep ascend. Lady Seolhwa will prove herself useful then\u2014but I shall not let her take your position.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Kim Dokja\u2019s turn to fall silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRest.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said as he stood up. \u201cI will have the doctors come here shortly.\u201d Then, shortly, a few clipped words were thrown over his shoulder as he took his leave. \u201cYour personal guard and your attendants are worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the day Kim Dokja woke up after the incident six months later, Yoo Joonghyuk visited him every day without fail. It didn\u2019t matter whether he was busy or not. If he was, he would simply bring his papers along. Yoo Joonghyuk would attend to his needs every day.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja was very uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMust he spend all his time with me?\u201d Kim Dokja nervously asked in between bites. Kim Dokja was only able to voice his opinion while Yoo Joonghyuk was away during a rare pause, meeting with pesky officials. Shin Yoosung blinked, her hand paused in her action of feeding Kim Dokja some sliced fruit.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make up for it, Your Grace.\u201d Shin Yoosung sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter almost four years?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf his Grace puts this much effort into attending to your needs, then I believe you know how serious he is.\u201d Shin Yoosung pointed out.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja chewed on his lip. \u201cI know.\u201d He looked away to the open window. \u201cI wish he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Lee Seolhwa coughed, \u201cyou need to lessen your visits and use your time more wisely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s eyebrow twitched. \u201cLike what?\u201d he spat out. The pen within his hand continued to sign the mountain of papers on his desk. His ministers would not let him go back to see his wife until he finished them.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, allow him to have a breath of fresh air instead of staying bedridden. Also, his body\u2019s condition as an omega concerns me. Did you not once think that his lack of heat was alarming?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u2018I considered it a blessing back then,\u2019</em> Yoo Joonghyuk crumpled his paper. \u201cI do now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, if I may be so forward, let me help you with bringing him back to full health.\u201d Lee Seolhwa exclaimed. The papers that were hidden within her sleeve were slapped against the desk. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s eyes narrowed as he picked up the papers to read their contents.</p>\n<p>\u201cA health plan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect, your Grace.\u201d Lee Seolhwa nodded. \u201cPlease look at page four. This involves regulating his hormonal levels.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk grunted. The ingredients needed were not only hard to obtain, but the steps to make the medicine were also time consuming and tedious. \u201cExpensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExchanging for lower-quality materials is not allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lee Seolhwa smiled sweetly. \u201cOf course, your Grace, I would never.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to drink this?\u201d Kim Dokja eyed the small bottle suspiciously. Lee Seolhwa had taken over as his personal doctor, supervising his food and exercise intake. It had only been a few weeks into the new regime did she produce something so odd. Its murky and viscous liquid did not look appetizing at all, even if it was marketed as a health product.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not take no for an answer.\u201d Lee Seolhwa smiled, the gaze in her eyes stern.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dare not contest that\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja muttered under his breath. In one fell swoop, he downed the entire bottle. He grimaced at the texture, but the bitter taste was not as bad as he had expected. It even had a floral aftertaste.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be giving you this medicine once every three days until you reach a healthy weight and your heat cycles follow a regular schedule.\u201d Lee Seolhwa explained to him as the other maids helped adjust his bedrest, \u201cIn return, we\u2019ll start trips to the main library to strengthen your leg muscles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe main library?\u201d Kim Dokja suddenly perked up. In the four years of living within the archduke\u2019s residence, he had never been allowed within the room he was most interested in. Shin Yoosung or Yoo Sangah would slip him some books now and then, but it could never compare to him personally picking books out and nestling in some corner to read.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lee Seolhwa nodded, \u201chis Grace is too busy at the moment to personally tell you, but you now have full access to the library.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kim Dokja\u2019s eyes sparkled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kim Dokja\u2019s eyes dimmed. The servants behind Yoo Joonghyuk took an extra step back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs your husband, am I not allowed to accompany you?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. His arm was still held outwards. It had been five minutes since he offered it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled as he nimbly took hold of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s arm, \u201cI just\u2026 wasn\u2019t expecting your Grace to be the one to lead me there.\u201d <em>I thought you were busy.</em></p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk pursed his lips. Just his Grace, not husband?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja grew more nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet us go,\u201d was all he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though Yoo Joonghyuk did say that, Kim Dokja was still recovering. Despite the fact that his health had gone leaps and bounds (he had gained a considerable amount of healthy weight and glow), his stamina was another issue altogether. They had only made it halfway to the main library when Kim Dokja\u2019s steps started to falter.</p>\n<p>Not wanting to waste more time, Yoo Joonghyuk swept Kim Dokja off his feet with ease into a bridal carry, causing the omega to squeak. None of the servants batted an eyelid at the sudden gesture.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine,\u201d Kim Dokja stammered. He didn\u2019t know where to put his hands. \u201cI just need a pause to rest. You can just\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cHush.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk replied.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja clamped his mouth shut. The gait of the alpha\u2019s steps was swift but steady, his hold on the omega surprisingly gentle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was only when they had arrived at the large doors leading to the main library did Yoo Joonghyuk put Kim Dokja down.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk placed a large key into Kim Dokja\u2019s hand. \u201cA copy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kim Dokja dumbly said. The key within his hand was warm with the alpha\u2019s residual body heat. It seemed like he had prepared it for Kim Dokja just so he could witness him opening it for the first time.</p>\n<p>The key made a satisfying sound as the lock slid open. When Kim Dokja opened the doors, the expanse of books before his eyes rekindled the fire burning within his soul. Off to the side, unbeknownst to Kim Dokja, a faint smile curled on Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to meeting your daily quota of exercise?\u201d Han Sooyoung bickered, swatting the omega\u2019s hand away from another pile of books. \u201cHis Grace will most likely build you a separate bedroom in the library if this keeps going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would think otherwise.\u201d Kim Dokja argued back. He stole back the pile of books under Han Sooyoung\u2019s arm. \u201cIt has been two months and not one movement on his side has been made. Why would he now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Han Sooyoung rolled her eyes. \u201cYou dimwit. Planning takes time. When the bedroom shows up, you owe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOwe you what? My virginity?\u201d Kim Dokja asked. Han Sooyoung immediately gagged on her candy and pulled away like lightning.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that so loudly, you idiot!\u201d Han Sooyoung screeched, frantically looking around to see if anyone else heard such crazy words. \u201cAs if I could take the archduke\u2019s wife! Just thinking about it makes me want to vomit. No, I just want you to do your stupid exercises more. Also, eat more, will you? You\u2019re still so thin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just get full fast, okay?\u201d Kim Dokja grumbled as he flipped open another book.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe still does not have much of an appetite?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked. His finger tapped methodically against the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Han Sooyoung nodded. \u201cThe maids have also noticed that he leaves food behind sometimes. You will have to intervene.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIntervene\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to show the archduchess that you care for him now?\u201d Han Sooyoung pressed. \u201cThey do say that food can win people over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 For once, I\u2019ll take your advice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! I\u2019m your right-hand strategist, how do you not take my advice?! Joonghyuk, you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUse my proper title.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo hell with that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEat.\u201d</p>\n<p>A plate was served before Kim Dokja. Its content consisted of a type of fried rice, with an omelette balanced delicately on top. When it was split open, the egg spilled to the sides, blanketing the steaming rice in a gentle wave. A thick, demi-glaze sauce was poured on top. The smell of the omurice was warm and enticing. Kim Dokja swallowed heavily.</p>\n<p>The archduke could cook?</p>\n<p>The couple were situated in the kitchen, where Yoo Joonghyuk simply plopped him down on a chair and told him not to move. Right before his very eyes, Kim Dokja watched the alpha make a meal with practised ease.</p>\n<p>The spoon that Kim Dokja was hesitantly grabbing for was taken by Yoo Joonghyuk instead. A small spoonful of omurice was lifted to his lips, an action so foreign of Yoo Joonghyuk that all Kim Dokja could do was blink.</p>\n<p>\u201cEat.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk repeated, this time gently pressing the spoon against the omega\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s mouth opened automatically and the spoon smoothly slid in.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s eyes widened, his mouth slowly chewing. The flavours that burst within his mouth was a pleasant mixture of savoury and slightly sweet. The egg and demi-glaze gave the rice a rich flavour, but not to the point of overpowering. When he swallowed his first bite, he looked at Yoo Joonghyuk expectantly.</p>\n<p>A never-had-he-seen-before smile was on Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips. A loud heartbeat passed before the spoon within the alpha\u2019s hand-fed his omega another mouthful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have hands, you know.\u201d Kim Dokja pointed out, despite making no effort to move whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn, you do.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk responded flatly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The plate of omurice was eaten completely at record speed. Kim Dokja even had the audacity to stick his finger onto the plate to lick up the remaining sauce.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was satisfied with the response. From then on, Yoo Joonghyuk made his wife\u2019s meals.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gained considerable weight.\u201d Lee Seolhwa commented with a bright smile. \u201cA healthy weight, mind you. No need to overthink it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled as he took the small bottle of medicine. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve been taking this for a while and I don\u2019t feel any different. Are you sure it\u2019s working?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou needed to reach a healthy body weight first.\u201d Lee Seolhwa noted. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve reached the ideal weight, you should soon see its effects. If nothing happens in the next few months, I will increase the potency as need be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Kim Dokja hummed in response. \u201cIt won\u2019t be sudden, will it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lee Seolhwa paused in her actions of putting away her medical equipment. \u201cIt depends on the person, your Grace. I cannot say for certain how much you will feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lee Seolhwa was right, one really couldn\u2019t tell how hard it would hit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, Kim Dokja merely thought the summer day was a little bit hotter than usual. He put it in the back of his mind when Yoo Joonghyuk shoved over a small bowl of homemade ice cream, but the thought resurfaced the next day.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it hot?\u201d Kim Dokja commented. He hated wearing the regular clothes nobles wore during the summer, so it was not surprising when Shin Yoosung looked over to find him with a simple shirt and pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it?\u201d her ears perked up. The summers in the Yoo territory were not particularly hot, given its close proximity to the mountains and large swaths of rivers. It usually received a decent amount of snow each year, so despite the fact that Kim Dokja had lived here for over four years, her Lady\u2019s response subtly meant something.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some ice, then, please excuse me,\u201d she said as she bowed out of the room quickly. A giggle rose from her throat as she trotted over to the archduke\u2019s office prior to her visit to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next three days were a constant build-up of uncomfortable heat. Anything that could cool his body temperature was only temporary, and Kim Dokja refused to discuss it with either Lee Seolhwa or Yoo Joonghyuk, and so locked himself in his room. He feared that if he opened the window, his pheromones would leak out, alerting Yoo Joonghyuk. He was the last person Kim Dokja wanted to see because even to this day, Yoo Joonghyuk had not touched him.</p>\n<p>An unrelenting urge for\u2026 <em>something</em> was constantly on Kim Dokja\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>He gritted his teeth. Were these the effects of the medicine he had? His first heat paled in comparison to how this one made his legs incredibly wobbly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He crawled over to his bed, sliding under the covers no matter how stifling hot it could be. His limbs shook, the ache within his body increased, and something wet drenched his undergarments.</p>\n<p>A knock on the door startled Kim Dokja out of his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Dokja,\u201d the alpha\u2019s recognizable voice called out, \u201clet me in.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Kim Dokja refused to answer, another knock rapped against the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re suffering. I can help. Let me in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just open the door then?\u201d Kim Dokja asked back, his voice shaky.</p>\n<p>A pause filled in the silence before Yoo Joonghyuk answered, \u201cbecause I want to respect your space this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s head slowly popped out from under the sheets, his gaze directed at the door. It was true that he didn\u2019t avoid Kim Dokja, he fed him well, personally saw over his recovery, and let him go wherever he pleased within the Yoo residence, but\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk called out once more, \u201conly you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja choked back a sob. His hands gripped the sheets tightly with whatever strength he had left.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja slowly replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door opened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kisses were peppered on his forehead as Kim Dokja\u2019s clothes were slowly stripped. Kim Dokja felt like a shy, virgin maiden that he was, as he curled into himself in a pathetic attempt to cover whatever he could. The alpha\u2019s pheromones soothed his nerves, and a shy whimper escaped his lips when a pulse of slick slid down onto the bed sheets.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d he mouthed out against Kim Dokja\u2019s shivering neck, trailing kisses from his chin to his collarbone. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Kim Dokja could retort, Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips met his, swallowing his cries as a tongue skillfully entered his mouth, tasting him fully. The omega\u2019s back pressed against the mattress, his arms weakly pressing against the alpha\u2019s chest while large hands roamed his skin. His legs were spread, his small cock painfully hard and dripping with precum, all of which was exposed to the elements. A panicked mewl escaped his muffled lips when he felt a finger touch his hole.</p>\n<p>It went in with ease thanks to his slick, which was soon followed by another finger. Kim Dokja\u2019s back arched at the intrusion as the fingers rubbed to find the one spot. Kim Dokja couldn\u2019t help but react to his alpha\u2019s touch, his body greedy and needy. Another finger was inserted and his thighs trembled suddenly, stars appearing in his eyes as an uncontrollable shiver overtook\u00a0 his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Kim Dokja finally managed to say after he had come at least four times. Four fingers stretched his hole impossibly wide, those obscene sounds coming from him sending slight tremors. But Yoo Joonghyuk had to prep \u2013 he was simply too large, and forcing himself in would most certainly hurt his wife.</p>\n<p>The pheromones exuded from his wife soon changed his mind however, its intensity growing stronger by the minute, filling the alpha\u2019s brain with a haze for lust. He bit his lip to ground himself slightly as he finally pulled out his thick cock from his pants, his shirt thrown off some while ago and long forgotten. His cock slid in between his buttocks before prodding the tip against the twitching hole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk entered in one push, fully sheathing himself to the hilt as Kim Dokja cried out. Yoo Joonghyuk growled at the sudden tightness, barely hanging onto his sanity as he waited for the other to relax. Kisses to Kim Dokja\u2019s forehead reassured the other that it was going to be okay and that nothing would harm him.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja cried.</p>\n<p>He was so gentle, a far cry from his usual brutish stature. Even his grip, which had the strength to crush his bones and bruise him blue had a cautious quality to it. Kim Dokja didn\u2019t know what to feel, or how to feel it. His tears kept falling, his cries ugly.</p>\n<p>And all Yoo Joonghyuk did was methodically rub at his sides to ease his pain, his kisses soft against the omega\u2019s body, begging for forgiveness. He let his omega cry his heart out, let him wrap his arms around his frame, and let him take the time that he needed to understand that he wasn\u2019t some stand-in anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Kim Dokja finally calmed down, Yoo Joonghyuk picked up his pace. He met the needs of his omega\u2019s sensitive body, hitting it where it was just right, and giving his omega just enough time to adjust yet not enough to think.</p>\n<p>After Kim Dokja came until it was nothing but clear, Yoo Joonghyuk shifted their positions. His omega rested on his lap, bouncing on his thick cock. Kim Dokja\u2019s tears had long been spent as his weak arms desperately clung onto his alpha\u2019s hold, slight hiccups mixing in with his sighs and moans. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s fingers found their way into Kim Dokja\u2019s mouth as the pressure inside Kim Dokja\u2019s body started to build up.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja flinched as expected to the growing size of the knot building within him as Yoo Joonghyuk grunted, pumping his seed deep inside. Teeth sank into his nape, sending another electrifying euphoria throughout his body.</p>\n<p>Claimed once more, this time willingly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja didn\u2019t know that he wouldn\u2019t be able to rest until a few days later. Now that his body was functioning as it should have since long ago, the heat that he experienced lasted much longer than he thought. He groaned when the curtains were pulled back, revealing the morning sun.</p>\n<p>Begrudgingly, he slowly got up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as he yawned. When he refocused, his eyes happened to land on his left hand. Suddenly, he woke up.</p>\n<p>The Yoo family\u2019s heirloom ring.</p>\n<p>The ring? The ring.</p>\n<p>It was on his finger.</p>\n<p>His finger? The one and only and most definitely expensive Yoo family heirloom ring?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s on your finger.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk sighed as he returned to the bedside after having tied the curtains. He had long guessed what Kim Dokja\u2019s reaction would have been. He gently reached for Kim Dokja\u2019s left hand, bringing it to his lips for a soft kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt should have been here originally.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk rubbed his thumb against Kim Dokja\u2019s ring finger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Yoo Joonghyuk looked up, fat tears fell from Kim Dokja\u2019s eyes, curling downwards to his chin and falling to the bed sheets below. Yoo Joonghyuk sighed again, his touch soft as he brushed some tears aside. Kim Dokja tried to blink them back, but the feeling that welled up in his chest denied him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve failed you for four years.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk murmured. \u201cCan we start over?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja cried even harder that morning. His grip on Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s hand tightened.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2026 try.\u201d Kim Dokja said between sniffles.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk returned the grip. \u201cOf course, dearest wife.\u201d</p>"
