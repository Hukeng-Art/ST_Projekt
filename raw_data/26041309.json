  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s ears were ringing as he stumbled over the debris, eyes searching the battlefield frantically. His heart plummeted in his stomach as he finally found who he was looking for. He took a few jerky steps forward, trembling hand reaching out towards Tony Stark. The elder man\u2019s face was ashen, the heavy damage to his face making Peter\u2019s stomach roll uncomfortably. His mentor was propped up against some debris, chest barely rising and falling, gaze vacant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr \u2013\u201c Peter could barely get the words out, blood tainted saliva filling his mouth and making him choke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Peter could even try again to call out again, Tony was obscured from his view. Peter hesitated, something akin to a whimper falling from his lips, eyes darting around the group that surrounded the man. He recognised them all, even beneath all the filth, dirt and blood they were all covered in. How could he not recognise Pepper Potts or Col. Rhodes? To not know who Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow and The Hulk were? (Though admittedly the Hulk looked a little different from the pictures Peter had seen).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter swayed on the spot when he saw Mr Strange (\u201c<em>Doctor Strange,\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re using made up names.\u201d</em>) strode towards the group, red cloak swaying with each purposeful step. The group parted for the man, Peter only managing to see the back of Pepper\u2019s head, before they converged around Tony once again, blocking him from every angle. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter wanted to take another step towards the group, but his feet remained rooted on the ground. He tried to listen, but there was too much ringing in his ears that he couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying in the distance between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then bright orange sparks were filling the air, a clear, sterile room on the other side of the portal too bright for the darkened battlefield. Then the group was rushing through and the portal closed leaving nothing but empty space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter stumbled, mouth opening and closing uselessly as he stared at the empty space where Tony had been.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere,\u201d Peter croaked out, his voice horrible and rough. \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo idea, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter turned at the voice on his left to find Quill (or was it Star Lord? Peter couldn\u2019t remember which one it was) standing not too far from him. Quill wasn\u2019t looking at him, instead his gaze trained on a green woman who stood next to a blue woman a few feet away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am Groot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, he looked pretty dead to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter stared at the tree and racoon that had spoken, his mind processing nothing other than the fact that Tony Stark was <em>dead</em>. His knees buckled and he sunk into the dirt beneath him, breath hitching in his chest as he stared blankly ahead. The ringing in his ear grew louder as his mind tumbled over the same thought over and over again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tony was dead. Tony was dead. Tony was dead. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Peter Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter blinked, registering the fact that a woman was crouching down in front of him. She was familiar and Peter was sure that at some point she had been glowing. Her smile was soft, and patient. He wondered how long the woman had been trying to get his attention. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Peter whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter said automatically, blinking once. \u201cI heal fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty handy,\u201d she smiled, her eyes flickering over his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were glowing,\u201d Peter spoke but the words didn\u2019t feel like they were coming from him. \u201cThat was awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She winked at him and Peter wanted to ask how she had done that, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask. Tony was dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2013 art moving out. The area isn\u2019t that safe. Are you okay to move?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter forced himself to focus on the woman before him, to process the words that she was saying. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took an embarrassing long time for him to register that she was holding her hand out to him to take. He finally lifted his arm, hand trembling and placed it in her hand. She squeezed his hand gently before she was pulling him to his feet. They felt like lead, exhaustion sinking into his bones making his knees buckle again. He was kept upright though before he could face plant into the dirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019fine,\u201d Peter mumbled as the woman cupped his elbow to keep him steady.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d she encouraged as she led him over to a small group that was huddling together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He recognised nobody and knew that he should feel the familiar prick of his senses giving him off a low warning but there was nothing. It had abandoned Peter the moment Tony died. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more, Wong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wong grumbled. He waved his arms in a wide circle and more orange sparks filled the air, opening another portal. The group converged forward and Peter was moved along with them by a strong, firm hand on his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t recognise the room. It large, spanning further than Peter had the energy to absorb. There were too many people, too much movement for him to take in the intricate details and beauty of the room. Their voices, tears and hurt all bled together until all Peter could hear was ringing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t aware that he had been moving until he was blinking at the small cot he was pushed down onto. It took him a moment to comprehend that the room was full of them, most of the cots already claimed by those being tended too with medical supplies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Peter asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m told we are in Wakanda,\u201d the woman said, gently lifting Peter feet until she manoeuvred him until he was lying down. \u201cThey are letting us recover here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice of them,\u201d Peter blinked. A blanket was draped over him and Peter wanted to feel embarrassed for being tucked in like a toddler, but he couldn\u2019t feel anything. He just allowed himself to be moved in any way that she wanted. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCarol Danvers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Carol Danvers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome Peter Parker,\u201d Carol smiled soft and kind \u201cGet some rest. Use that magical healing of yours.\u201d And making sure he was completely covered by the blanket; she turned and made her way through the cluster of people leaving Peter all alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter stared at the ceiling, blinking slowly at the crack his gaze latched onto. He listened to the ringing in his ears, eyes tracing the crack over and over again with the constant loop of <em>Tony\u2019s dead</em> playing in his mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Exhaustion had won out and Peter woke up to his stomach rumbling the smell of fresh food close by. He blinked at the wall, body uncurling from where he had naturally curled up in his sleep. His body ached as he stretched but there were no broken bones that prevented him from sitting up.\u00a0 He scrubbed at his eyes as they stuck together and wondered how long he had been asleep for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter turned at the voice and saw a man crouching down beside his cot, holding a tray of food. He was dressed in a way that Peter wasn\u2019t used to seeing and it took him a moment to remember that he had been taken to Wakanda.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Peter murmured back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d the man asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something flickered in the man\u2019s eyes and he smiled warmly at Peter. \u201cI\u2019m T\u2019Challa. Here, I have brought you some breakfast. Eat and when you are done, we will get you a shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter blinked at the King, taking the tray that was pushed into his hands. \u201cUh \u2013 I \u2013 thank you \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEat, Peter,\u201d T\u2019Challa rose from his crouch. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter did as he was told, eating automatically but not tasting a thing. It was a shame because it looked delicious and in any other circumstances, he would have been in awe that he was eating food that <em>the </em>Black Panther had personally given him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Tony was dead, and he had taken a part of Peter\u2019s soul with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When his tray was finished, T\u2019Challa returned, taking it from his limp hands and tucking it under his arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to take a shower now?\u201d the king asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes please,\u201d Peter said, not really knowing what else to say. He untangled himself from the blanket, folding it once, twice, three times and then a fourth, before laying it gently on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d T\u2019Challa said and Peter fell into step with the King.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t remember much of the walk to the bathroom, his mind stuck and skipping like a broken record; <em>Tony\u2019s dead, Tony\u2019s dead, Tony\u2019s dead</em>. His jaw did drop as he took in probably the most beautiful bathroom he had ever seen. He feared touching anything, sure that he would cover it in filth. Everything was so pristine and so <em>grand </em>that it made Peter\u2019s home look a cardboard box in comparison. A sudden ache blossomed in his chest that had tears pricking at the back of his eyes and he flared his nostrils to keep them from falling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake all the time you need,\u201d T\u2019Challa said. \u201cIf you need anything, there will be a guard outside the doors. Just ask them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter whispered, voice cracking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa smiled, kind enough not to say anything about Peter being nearly in tears and left the bathroom, the large oak doors falling closed behind him. Peter crossed the room and locked the doors before he looked in the large glass mirror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stared at his reflection, not quite believing that it was him. He was pale underneath all the dirt and blood and his eyes had dark circles underneath them. His hair was mattered with gunk and he looked younger than he felt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dropping his gaze, Peter turned his back on the mirror and disengaged the suit, the armour falling to a heap on the floor. His first suit sat firmly against his body and was cleaner than the Iron Spider suit but not completely unscathed. He tapped the spider emblem on his chest, the suit fluttering as it billowed out and slid down his body. He pulled off his boxers, leaving everything in a heap before stepping into the shower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shivered as he stepped under the warm spray of the water, dunking his head underneath and simply stood there. The water rushed through his ears, drowning out the ringing and thundered against his ears drums until it was the only thing he could think or feel. The water ran a mixture of brown and red until Peter remembered that he had to wash himself. His hair needed four washes, the shampoo giving his curls a tropical scent. The soap smelled like lemongrass as he rubbed it over every inch of his skin, over and over again until the rhythm nearly had him falling asleep standing up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The water never ran cold, but Peter did eventually switch it off, leaving him standing their dripping until a full body shiver had him reaching for a fluffy towel and drying himself. Fresh clothes had been left for him and he pulled on the fitted jeans, plain black t-shirt and navy coloured hoodie. There were even a pair of shoes that were a little big but wearable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter scanned the room, eyes catching the bin that was tucked in the corner. Peter took out the lining (thankful that it was empty) and piled his suits inside before tying it up. He hung his towel over the edge of the shower and looked about the bathroom. He was sure what he was supposed to do now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>May would know what to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Picking up the bag, Peter made his way out the bathroom and into the hall. He started walking in a direction, hoping that it was the right way. He scanned the halls as people flittered by, nobody really stopping to look at him. He hoped to see Carol but couldn\u2019t see the familiar blonde. He did however see Wong up ahead and then he was jogging up to the man before he knew what he was doing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you take me home?\u201d Peter gasped as soon as he close enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wong turned to raise an eyebrow at him. \u201cDo I look like a taxi service to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Peter begged. \u201cI have to go home. I have to \u2013 my Aunt \u2013 I need to see her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wong stared at him for a beat before rolling his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m already heading out. What\u2019s the address?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c15th Street, Queens, New York City, New York,\u201d Peter rattled off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wong nodded and Peter watched as orange sparks filled the hallway until Peter building grew larger and larger before his eyes. Without hesitation Peter was stepping through, onto the familiar street.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The street was busy, and nobody appeared to be fazed by a teenage boy stepping out of thin air. People were embracing one another, dancing in the streets as music blared from all directions. The joy and relief in the air was palpable but Peter couldn\u2019t feel it. How could he when Tony was gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou good kid? I have to get back to the Sanctum,\u201d Wong said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Thank you,\u201d Peter nodded and then the orange sparks were gone, and Peter was wholly surrounded by Queens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heartbeat galloping in his chest, Peter ran into the building, forgoing the elevator to rush up the stairs two at a time until he was bursting out onto the seventh floor and sprinting to his door. He patted his pockets for his keys before remembering they were in his backpack which was somewhere hidden in New York that he had webbed to a brick wall five years ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The breath was knocked out of Peter chest at the thought and he pounded on the door, choking out \u201cMay! Aunt May!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He heard movement on the other side of the door, and he choked on a sob as the dead bolt was turned and the door was opening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt May I \u2013 I \u2013 you\u2019re not \u2013 who are you?\u201d Peter stammered, stumbling back as he took in the woman who was defiantly not his aunt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looked younger than May did, peering at him cautiously as she half hid herself behind the door. \u201cI\u2019m Kate. This is my apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter said stupidly. \u201cI live here. This is my house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something flickered across the girls face until she was looking at him with such pity that Peter could practically taste it. \u201cYou were dusted, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\u201cWhere\u2019s my Aunt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I took over the rent three and a half years ago,\u201d Kate hesitated, biting her lip before adding. \u201cThe woman, your aunt, moved out. She hadn\u2019t been dusted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter opened his mouth, but nothing came out. May had moved? She had left their apartment, packed up all their things and just gone? Peter tried to think where she would have gone but his mind couldn\u2019t get passed the fact that May had left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry kid,\u201d Kate said. \u201cYou should try the Displacement Centres their setting up at all the schools.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter nodded dumbly and didn\u2019t care when Kate slowly shut the door on him, the dead bolt sliding back into place. He turned and walked numbly to the stairs. His body jolted with each lethargic step he took until he was crossing the lobby and stepping out onto the street where the celebrations continued.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter started walking, no destination in mind because there was no destination. May had packed up, left and could be anywhere. He had no money, no way of contacting her or if she still even had the same number to contact her with. Tony was dead, gone, unreachable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter wished he had never woken up on Titan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know where he is?\u201d Tony growled, glaring at the group that stood around his bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony had woken up in an unfamiliar bed, left side numb with a sleeping Morgan on his chest and Pepper\u2019s beautiful (and slightly wet) smiling face hovering over him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey sleepy head,\u201d Pepper greeted him, voice soft and warm, hand gently carding through his hair. \u201cGlad to see you finally joining us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2019d I miss?\u201d Tony slurred, right arm tightening around Morgan, hugging her closer. His little girl hadn\u2019t woken up, simply snuggled deeper into his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThree weeks,\u201d Pepper pressed a kiss to his temple. \u201cNot bad considering your left arm is gone and you look like you lost a battle with a hacksaw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony glanced down at his left side, vision tilting for just a second before the heavily bandaged stump that had once been his left arm came into view. \u201cHuh, look at that.\u201d He rolled his head back to Pepper and smiled at her. \u201cDidn\u2019t like that one that much anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pepper laughed, more tears spilling out of her eyes before she was hugging Tony around the neck tightly, squishing Morgan between the two of them and whispering, \u201cMe either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took him another couple of days to stay awake for more than ten minutes at a time and for him to realise that through the constant visits from the team, Peter had yet to see him. Three weeks was far too long for him not to be holding his kid in his arms. (<em>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be one arm now that you lost your other one?\u201d \u201cYour daughter makes a good point\u201d \u201cYeah, well just wait until I build myself a better arm.\u201d</em>)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright guys, where\u2019s my kid? Is he okay? He\u2019s not hurt, is he?\u201d Tony tried to get himself up out of bed only to be pushed back by Pepper\u2019s firm hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Happy had taken Morgan out to get some breakfast to, in Morgan\u2019s words, leave them to their boring grown up talk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, Tony, he\u2019s probably catching up with his friends,\u201d Pepper scolded before turning to the group that was keeping Tony company. \u201cYou called him, right? Told him that Tony was awake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both Tony and Pepper watched as Natasha, Bruce and Steve all shared a pointed look with one another.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me you called Peter,\u201d Tony voice was clipped as he stared at the three.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Bruce answered Tony. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen go and pick him up from where he\u2019s been staying,\u201d Tony growled, eyes flicking between the three of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d Bruce said hesitantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pepper stood up and glared at the three Avengers. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know where he is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the battle Carol took him to Wakanda with the others to get treated,\u201d Natasha explained, her expression not as closed off as it had once been as Tony could see the guilt on her face. \u201cT\u2019Challa said that he was fine. That he was eating, and he took Peter to have a shower, but the kid never came to see him again. We learned that Wong had taken Peter to his old apartment in Queens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMay doesn\u2019t live there anymore,\u201d Tony sucked in a deep breath, good hand clenching the rail of his bed. \u201cHasn\u2019t been there for over three years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy told us,\u201d Steve shifted his weight, watching Tony carefully. \u201cTony, we went looking for him. The girl who lived there said he came by, but she had sent him to the Displacement Centres that were being set up. \u00a0We tried them, but we don\u2019t know where he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you start looking for him?\u201d Tony demanded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLast week,\u201d Natasha admitted after a long pause of silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been on his own for three weeks?\u201d Pepper gasped, hand coming to her mouth and she shared a horrified look with Tony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the clean-up, the press wanting to know what happened, everyone being un-dusted, wondering if you were going to make it,\u201d Steve listed. \u201cWe forgot about Peter. We assumed he was still in Wakanda and didn\u2019t think-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you telling me that I invented time travel to get my kid back, and you <em>fucking lost him?!</em>\u201d Tony exploded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone flinched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is Rhodey?\u201d Tony snapped, looking around the room as if he expected the man to suddenly appear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s out looking for Peter now,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe got called back to work while you were unconscious. He thought Peter was still in Wakanda under T\u2019Challa\u2019s care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony scrubbed at his face, wincing as his hand brushed over the still sensitive scars. \u201cHave you called his Aunt? Told her what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy did,\u201d Natasha answered. \u201cAs soon as he found out. He said May\u2019s trying to get a flight back into the States, but the flights have been fully booked. She\u2019s hoping to be here by Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you try tracking his suit?\u201d Pepper asked, pulling out her phone and switching it on. The phone chimed as it loaded up and so was buzzing with frequent messages coming through. She ignored them all, looking at the only ones from May Parker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cWe think it was damaged in the battle and we haven\u2019t been able to a location.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony winced as he pulled the IV out of his arm, ignoring the <em>\u2018TONY!\u2019 </em>that got him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve stepped forward, halting Tony\u2019s attempt to get out of bed. \u201cYou\u2019re still healing. We have everyone focusing on Peter. We will find him, but you have to stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRogers, you let me get out of this <em>fucking </em>bed right now. My kid is missing. You <em>forgot </em>about him. Move.\u201d Tony growled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be standing,\u201d Steve pressed, face pinched with stress.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen get me a wheelchair,\u201d Tony snapped. \u201c<em>Fucking hell Rogers,</em> I need my kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve clenched his jaw, lips pressed tightly together before he stepped across the room and wheeled the chair that sat in the corner over to Tony. \u201cYou have to stay in the chair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony levelled him with a glare as he swung his legs out of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTony, I think you are forgetting something,\u201d Pepper said.</p>\n<p><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony turned to look over his good shoulder, wincing as the scars on his neck pulled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a hospital gown,\u201d Pepper smirked, eyes pointedly gazing him up and down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been seen out in weirder outfits,\u201d Tony grunted, turning to face forward again. He continued to edge himself closer to the edge of the bed, his feet nearly touching the floor. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can already feel Peter\u2019s embarrassment for when he learns you went out looking for him in a hospital gown that tied up at the back,\u201d Pepper mused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony paused for a beat before letting his feet touch the ground. His legs wobbled dangerously, and he ignored the way Steve looked as if he was about to lunge for him and strap him back on to the bed. He grunted as he shifted his weight and all but fell into the wheelchair. He gritted his teeth against the new wave of pain that radiated up his side and looked to his wife.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst stop, Pep, the hotel to get me some less Peter embarrassing clothes,\u201d Tony huffed. \u201cThen we go find our kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy, please tell me you have found Peter,\u201d were the first words May Parker said to the Asset Manager as she stepped out customs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Happy said gravelly, taking her suitcase from her hand. He placed a steady but gentle hand on her back, propelling her forward. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find him though. Tony\u2019s got everyone looking for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t he track the suit?\u201d May asked. \u201cTony promised me that he put everything in that suit. That he would <em>always</em> be able to find Peter in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Happy assured her, weaving them through the large groups of people milling about the airport. \u201cBut with the last battle, we think it go damaged so it\u2019s offline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They made it outside where Happy\u2019s car was waiting right out front. While he placed her suitcase in the boot, May slipped into the passenger seat, buckling herself up. As soon as Happy was in the car and pulling into traffic she turned as much as she could in her seat to face him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust run through everything you\u2019ve done so far again, please,\u201d May said, the small wrinkles around her eyes creasing. \u201cYou contacted his friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Happy nodded, briefly glancing at May before looking back at the road. \u201cWe contacted Ned. He hasn\u2019t seen or heard from Peter. He said his family had moved so Peter doesn\u2019t know where to find him. We contacted MJ too, but she hasn\u2019t heard from him either. They both promised to keep an eye out for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Spider-Man?\u201d May asked, looking at her phone. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at all the news reports, but nobody has mentioned him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there haven\u2019t been any sightings of him,\u201d Happy said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Peter loves being Spider-Man,\u201d May looked back to Happy. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t just give that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d Happy gripped the steering wheel tightly. \u201cBoss says that Karen is still active.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Karen, his AI?\u201d May asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIDAY has been able to communicate with her but she\u2019s not sure where Peter is or if he is injured,\u201d Happy explained. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t put on the suit since he left Wakanda.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was over three weeks ago!\u201d May all but yelled. She leaned back heavily in her chair, the familiar string of tears filling her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She thought that she would never see her baby again. When Peter had been dusted those five years ago, she had nearly broken. Pepper had been the one to call her, to share the news that Tony and Peter had gone to space but only Tony had returned. She had refused to speak to Tony. He had promised to keep her baby safe only for him to turn to ash on a planet she had no idea existed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until one day Tony turned up on her doorstep, Peter\u2019s Midtown sweater in his hands and told her that he and Pepper were expecting a baby and promptly burst into tears. Having never seen Tony Stark cry, May had automatically let him into the apartment and led him to the couch. They had spent the day talking out their grief, sharing stories, laughing, crying before they somehow became friends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They kept in touch, May even going over to the Lake House once a month to hang out until a year later May\u2019s mother fell ill. May had packed up the apartment, putting most of it into storage before moving back to Italy but still kept in contact with the Stark family. The minute she realised that those who had been dusted were returning, she knew Tony had figured it out and started making plans to get home to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find him, May,\u201d Happy said. \u201cTony didn\u2019t invent time travel just to lose Peter now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>May blinked. \u201cTony invented time travel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Happy did his best to explain what had happened and by the time they reached the hotel, May was up to speed on everything that had gone down. He led May up to the top floor and to the suite that Tony, Pepper and Morgan were temporarily calling their home while they searched for Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMay,\u201d Pepper greeted her as soon as she stepped into the room, pulling her into a tight hug. \u201cThank god you made it. How are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy just explained time travel to me so I now have a headache,\u201d May said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have just the pill for that,\u201d Pepper said, taking her hand and leading her further into the room and towards the couch that was already occupied by Tony, Rhodey and the very recognizable Steve Rogers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>May sat down, ignoring them for the moment and smiled at Morgan who was happily sprawled out on the floor, colouring by her father\u2019s feet. When Pepper returned with two pills and a glass of water, May accepted them thankfully, swallowing down the pills and sculling the whole glass of water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d May gasped once she had finished, placing the glass on the coffee table. She wiped her mouth and finally turned her attention to Tony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked terrible. His left arm was noticeably missing and despite the glasses perched on his nose she could still see the scars that crawled up the side of face. He was pale, hair sticking up in all directions and was in a serious need of a shave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLost some weight I see,\u201d May nodded at Tony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s lips quirked into a smile while Rhodey smothered a laugh behind his hand. She ignored the face of discomfort that Steve made, not too happy with the super solider who hadn\u2019t been keeping an eye out on her nephew while Tony had been unconscious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look good too, May,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me you are close to finding Peter,\u201d May begged. The silence that followed didn\u2019t fill her with any confidence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve checked all the Displacement Centres in Queens and in the surrounding areas,\u201d Rhodey said. \u201cNobody\u2019s can verify that they have seen them because of the amount of traffic they are getting but we check every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got his photo up at each centre with a number to call,\u201d Tony said. \u201cJust in case he sees them but nothing so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>May sighed, head dropping into her hands. She took a few steadying breaths before she was clearing her throat and looking back up again. \u201cOkay. He\u2019s a fifteen-year-old with no money, no phone and with only the clothes on his back. Where would he go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has to be getting food from somewhere,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWe\u2019ve checked the sandwich place he loves but the owner hasn\u2019t seen him. He promised to call if he did show up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are so many food drives around the city that he could be going to one of those,\u201d Steve said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been staking them out but no luck yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Peter,\u201d May whispered to herself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find him,\u201d Pepper said, arm coming around May\u2019s shoulder to hug her tightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t come back,\u201d May said, looking to Pepper. \u201cIf he knew I wasn\u2019t there, why didn\u2019t he come back to you or Tony? Why would he just disappear like this? This isn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s scared,\u201d Morgan piped up from the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean sweet pea?\u201d Tony asked, gently smoothing his daughter\u2019s hair back with his good arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a little scared when I saw Daddy at the hospital,\u201d Morgan admitted. \u201cAnd I wanted to hide but mummy said that even though daddy was ugly now it wasn\u2019t anything to be afraid of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t not call you ugly,\u201d Pepper told Tony, as he shot her a betrayed look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI called you ugly,\u201d Rhodey grinned. \u201cBut then, you\u2019ve always been ugly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am the best-looking man in this room,\u201d Tony huffed and gave Rhodey\u2019s braces a pointed look. \u201cAnd the best-looking cripple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you are, Tony Stank,\u201d Rhodey hummed. \u201cWhatever helps you sleep at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>point </em>is that Peter\u2019s scared,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cMay, are there any places that Peter would go to seek some comfort?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo you,\u201d May looked directly at Tony. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he hasn\u2019t come to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him,\u201d Tony swallowed thickly, looking older than May had ever seen him look. \u201cI promise, we\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s limbs protested as his body curled up tightly in an attempt to fight off the chill in the air. His stomach cramped and rebelled against the small portion of stale bread he had found behind the service station. It was the only thing he had eaten in the past two days, the only thing he had been able to find. People weren\u2019t wasting food anymore and so scraps were hard to come by.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tried to eat at the food drives. By the time Peter managed to wake himself up and drag him to the drives, the lines were long, and he mostly missed out. When he did manage to get there early, the portions were small, and he was too hungry to think about rationing it. It just made him tired and weak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slept a lot. After the first time someone stole his shoes during the night Peter tucked himself into high, tight corners under bridges so they couldn\u2019t rob him of anything else. It worked at first, until he was so weak, he fell off into the water below and struggled to swim back to shore. He had managed to keep hold of his suits even though he couldn\u2019t put them back on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter found new places to sleep but his senses were too loud, the city too much for him and so he had to leave. He walked as far as he could, his suit and a single piece of cardboard his only possessions. He walked until his feet bled and the sound of the city no longer could torture him. There was nothing left in the city for him anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He found a patch of dense trees and made himself a shelter. It wasn\u2019t the greatest, but it mostly kept him dry and some of the wind out. When hunger overwhelmed him he found a service station not too far and that\u2019s where he found his scraps of food. But it was getting harder and harder to walk, his feet sore and aching constantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t matter. There was nobody left worry about Peter Parker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ned had moved and Peter couldn\u2019t find him, and he had no idea where MJ lived. He had no phone to communicate with either of them and one time he tried to use the library a fight had broken out just as he was entering and even though he had nothing to do with it, they hadn\u2019t let him in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something tugged at his hood and Peter whined as the cold air bit as his exposed cheeks and ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Parker, Peter, can you hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The voice was familiar, but Peter was <em>so tired,</em> and he couldn\u2019t focus on anything other than getting warm. He curled tighter around his suits in order to protect them. His spider-sense wasn\u2019t going off but none of his powers seemed to be working lately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me move him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something was laid over Peter and he whined pathetically in the back of his throat as he was rolled over and wrapped in something heavy and warm. Something brushed against his cheeks, gentle and soft. Peter didn\u2019t try to struggle, couldn\u2019t even if he wanted to which he didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to hurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s stomach swooped as he was suddenly lifted, and his head swam. He didn\u2019t remember being moved, but when became aware he was lying on something much softer than his piece of cardboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere was he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOutside the city.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you giving him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHe needs nutrients. He\u2019s malnourished, starving and dehydrated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Peter whined when something pricked his skin, but he didn\u2019t even have the energy to squirm away. Something brushed his hair back from his face, soft and soothing and familiar. But it couldn\u2019t be true because Peter didn\u2019t have anyone familiar anymore. Everyone was gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He must have spaced out again because he became aware of the ache in his feet and he flinched, legs kicking out weakly as sharp pain radiated up his arches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Underoos. You\u2019re okay. Shhhhh, I know it hurts but you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter whined, kicking out again as another sharp pain flared up his feet but something was smoothing back his hair. He rolled his head to the side, prying open his eyes. He blinked; his vision blurry as he tried to focus. Eventually the room came into focus and Peter was aware of a body right beside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter stared at the man. The sharp angles of his face, the brown eyes full of worry were all hauntingly familiar. There were new scars on one side of his face and Peter whined at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019 I dead too?\u201d He whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo Pete, you\u2019re not dead. You\u2019re going to be just fine,\u201d Tony soothed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Peter let his eyes slip closed again. \u201cDreamin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, kiddo. I\u2019m here. Can you open your eyes for me again,\u201d Tony pleaded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t want to, didn\u2019t want to open his eyes again and see that Tony wasn\u2019t there but his voice had sounded so sad that Peter pried them open once again. He blinked in shock to see that Tony was still there, face closer than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019 dreaming. S\u2019not real. You\u2019re dead,\u201d Peter mumbled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s face creased as he frowned. \u201cNo kid, I\u2019m not dead. I\u2019m right here. You\u2019re not dreaming. I promise you.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\u201cS\u2019raccoon said you were dead,\u201d Peter blinked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2013 Rocket,\u201d Tony\u2019s lips pursed into a thin line. \u201cI\u2019ll kill that rodent.\u201d Tony sighed heavily and cupped Peter\u2019s face. \u201cI promise you kid, that I am alive. I\u2019m right here and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter leaned into the touch, a tear rolling down his cheek. \u201cTony?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah kiddo, it\u2019s me,\u201d Tony soothed, his voice soft and fatherly like.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHurts,\u201d Peter mumbled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m taking care of it. You can go back to sleep,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes slipped closed willingly and he hummed in the back of his throat, drifting off once again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony felt the moment Peter drifted back off to sleep and he gently wiped the tear away from Peter\u2019s cheek. His kid was in desperate need of a shower; hair oily and littered with dirt and he was pretty sure the kid had lice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis healing factor has started again,\u201d Strange said, voice low in the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony looked towards the end of the large hotel bed where Strange was re-wrapping Peter\u2019s feet in bandages. Around the bed IV lines had been set up to get Peter\u2019s nutrients back up and to get him re-hydrated. The curtains of the room had been drawn shut, blocking out the streetlights. Pepper, Morgan and May were asleep in the opposite bedroom across the suite, Tony deciding to keep watch over Peter for the night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank god,\u201d Tony sighed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along with the dehydration and starvation, Peter\u2019s feet had been cut up badly and were infected. Strange had said that Peter\u2019s healing factor was working overtime to keep him alive and if they hadn\u2019t found him when they did, he most likely would have succumbed to the infection.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your shoulder?\u201d Strange asked, finishing with Peter\u2019s bandages.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Tony grunted. He was propped up against the headboard with a mountain of pillows and Peter tucked up against his good side. He was in a bit of pain but that didn\u2019t matter because Peter as safe and back by his side. He would worry about himself when Peter was well again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apologies for not being here sooner,\u201d Strange said, causing Tony to look up at the uncharacteristic words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had to return the stones,\u201d Tony waved him off. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Strange pursed his lips. \u201cI would have waited if I had known that his Aunt wasn\u2019t there. Wong assured me he had gotten home safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI more worried that the fact my kid thought I was dead,\u201d Tony growled. \u201cThat nobody thought to keep him close. <em>They knew </em>I did this because of Peter and they left him on that battlefield by himself!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Strange had been the break they had been looking for. Two days after May arrived and several more useless searches, Strange had portaled into their hotel room in order to take a look of Tony\u2019s arm and to assure them that the stones had been returned to their original times.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Tony had pointed with his good arm. \u201cYou can find Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Parker is missing?\u201d Strange had frowned, eyes flickering to each of them as he took in the tension in the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor over three weeks,\u201d Tony had growled. \u201cTrack him. Use your witchcraft and find my kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me ten minutes,\u201d and Strange had portaled right back out of the room. True to the sorcerer\u2019s word, he returned ten minutes later with Peter swaddled in his red cloak. There had been a flurry over movement as Strange started barking orders, and they hurried to turn down one of the beds and Peter was laid down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony had nearly keeled over at the sight of his kid, only Rhodey\u2019s strong grip around him keeping him upright. Peter had looked better on the battlefield. The clothes he wore were filthy and stunk up the room, but it was the sight of his very visible ribs and sunken cheek bones that had Tony\u2019s stomach rolling at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>May hadn\u2019t been much better, promptly bursting into tears at the sight of her nephew while Steve and Natasha had followed Strange\u2019s orders to get him settled while he opened a portal into a medical facility, grabbing everything he would need.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet some rest, Strange,\u201d Tony said, looking at the Sorcerer. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Strange nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll return in the morning. When he wakes, I would like him to try something solid. The sooner we can the faster we can get him into a shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony snorted quietly and couldn\u2019t help but agree. His kid was rank, but that didn\u2019t stop Tony from pressing a kiss to his forehead and hugging his son closer. It would be a long time before he let his kid back out of his sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ffeaa614cdd2f9215154c3ce930ccd2/467e6f36845dcbcb-ba/s400x600/d5322e0a864d45a6a61de6f8e5ff6c48a085710f.jpg\" alt width=\"400\" height=\"566\">\n</p>"
