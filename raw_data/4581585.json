  "text": "<p>\n<strong>Chapter 1</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The howl rises at dusk.</p>\n<p>It is almost dark, later than they usually come, late enough that everyone\u2019s eyes are shifted, though they haven\u2019t yet lit the lamps in the house. It is also the end of the raiding season, almost cool enough that the attacks stop, so there is a beat of surprise around the table. At least, Cora pauses with her fork halfway to her mouth, Laura cocks her head to the side, and Derek knocks a glass of water over as his arm jerks. Only his mother rolls smoothly to her feet, eyes already pointing somewhere in the distance.</p>\n<p>Laura recovers next, shoving her seat back and dashing outside before his mother even says anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the west,\u201d his mother tells him. \u201cDerek, stay here with Cora. No wandering outside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then she\u2019s gone as well.</p>\n<p>Derek feels a familiar blush come over his face. Because he\u2019s nearly eighteen. He knows he\u2019s supposed to be a fighter like all the other werewolves his age. But he\u2019s not good at it. He knows that. He is big enough and strong enough and his mom taught him all the basics, same as Laura, but he just\u2026 fighting isn\u2019t natural to him. He knows all the moves but can never put them together. He doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s not good at it.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not a secret. The entire pack knows about his disgrace. Not even just his pack. The entire allegiance of Hales and Itos and Sorensens know. He\u2019s Derek Hale, the only Hale son, who can\u2019t fight. Who doesn't seem to want to.</p>\n<p>Training is due to start in just a few days and his mom hasn\u2019t even mentioned it. No one has.</p>\n<p>So when his mother tells him to \u201cstay here with Cora,\u201d what she means is \u201cyou stay inside and safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>And when she says \u201cNo wandering outside,\u201d he knows she\u2019s actually talking to Cora. Cora is the one who is only fourteen and already trying to get Talia to abuse her Alpha powers and let her start training early.</p>\n<p>So, technically, his job of watching over Cora is important. He can\u2019t let her get killed \u2013 or worse, snatched \u2013 just because she\u2019s impulsive and thinks she\u2019s invincible.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still embarrassing, though. He wants to like fighting and killing and protecting their people from the humans that raid and kill his people, he just\u2026 he just doesn\u2019t. He just-</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Cora says, almost the moment the door shuts behind their mother. She\u2019s already moving towards the back. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek replies, rising and following her. \u201cCora, stop. Mom said-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom will never find out,\u201d Cora replies. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fight \u2013 not that you can anyway \u2013 we\u2019re just going to look.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bad idea. He knows it\u2019s a bad idea. But she\u2019s already halfway out the back door and he can\u2019t think of a way to stop her that doesn\u2019t involve physical restraint and to do that would mean he\u2019d have to catch her first and she\u2019s-</p>\n<p>She takes off into the woods and he follows. He has to keep her safe.</p>\n<p>He tells himself that repeatedly as they venture further and further from the village. Because Cora might think she's brave enough to fight humans but being caught disobeying their mother was a different thing entirely. So she leads them on a wide loop towards the west, careful to duck behind trees as other werewolves rush towards the sighting. Or at least, she remains hidden until they are deep enough in the woods that there are no more werewolves to spot them. Unfortunately, that just means she starts moving even more quickly and he\u2019s so focused on following her through the darkness that he completely misses it when there is suddenly a flurry of movement from above them.</p>\n<p>The human is on them in a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a burst of bright light that blinds Derek temporarily and Cora screams and-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s mostly luck. Cora shrieks as it grabs her, throwing her head back to howl for their mother, knocking it in the face as she does. Its grip on her doesn\u2019t loosen but it gives Derek enough time to blink vision back into his eyes and, well, that\u2019s when he sees them.</p>\n<p>The tattoos.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows that humans have tattoos, though mostly they are just dark bands wrapped around their arms that you can only see once you\u2019ve stripped them of their armor. There\u2019s a few differences, a few unique designs that werewolves don\u2019t bother identifying but\u2026</p>\n<p>But all werewolves know these ones.</p>\n<p>The dark, swirling pattern wraps around the human\u2019s wrist and hand and Derek focuses his vision, hoping that somehow he\u2019s seeing things wrong and the corresponding pattern won\u2019t be on the human\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s there.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a Fury.</p>\n<p>Something in Derek\u2019s stomach turns to ice. Because all humans are dangerous. They use the cover of night to attack and kill without mercy or simply grab younger werewolves and drag them off and the first rule of fighting a human is to always be prepared for the multitude of weapons and herbs that they have on them at all times.</p>\n<p>But of all the humans, a Fury is the most dangerous.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re recognizable by the tattoos on their hands and neck, but none have ever been killed. Or captured.</p>\n<p>And they are known for killing werewolves rather than snatching them. And sometimes those that are taken are able to escape or the pack is able to track them down, but\u2026 you can\u2019t track someone when they are dead. When they\u2019ve been burned and-</p>\n<p>He moves before he really lets himself think about how impossible this is. Cora is still yelling and the Fury is still trying to drag her backwards into the woods and the air is thickening as if there\u2019s another trick he\u2019s about to pull and Derek moves.</p>\n<p>It lacks any true finesse of a fighter. He simply lunges and feels his claws sink into flesh.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tingling \u2013 almost a burn \u2013 and it occurs to him that the Fury is fighting back even as Derek\u2019s claws are inside him, but luckily Cora takes advantage of the Fury\u2019s momentary distraction to shove an elbow into his stomach (that\u2019s a trick she has learned from Laura).</p>\n<p>The Fury yelps and lets go and, for once, Derek doesn\u2019t hesitate. He steps forward and grabs and then throws with all his strength because the thing is not hurting Cora and-</p>\n<p>Dimly, he hears a crash and maybe a crack but the point is that it\u2019s far away. It\u2019s gone. Cora\u2019s safe.</p>\n<p>\u201cCora,\u201d he says, panting a little. He knew the fight must have only been a few moments, but it seemed longer. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYe-yeah,\u201d she says, looking over at him. She looks pale. Pale and scared. He doesn\u2019t blame her. \u201cIs it dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says. He\u2019s probably not lying. His hand is covered in blood and the crack that he heard was probably the sound of its head hitting a tree. Or the ground. It\u2019s probably dead.</p>\n<p>\u201cI- Derek you killed a human,\u201d Cora says it with a touch of awe. Derek nods. He\u2019s just glad she seems unaware that it was actually a Fury. Good. He doesn\u2019t want her to be more freaked out that she already is. \u201cIt just- it just came out of nowhere and you- you <em>saved</em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d He says instead of answering her statement. \u201cMom\u2019s going to kill us if she finds out we were out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora nods wordlessly and they turn for home.</p>\n<p>Derek glances to woods as they leave, idly taking note of where they are.</p>\n<p>The Fury is dead. It has to be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For all intents and purposes, the raid is a success for the werewolves. No one was killed or taken and they had managed to capture three of the humans, which will now be used for training purposes. People are practically giddy the next day. Everyone grins broadly as they pass each other in the streets and children are reenacting the bits of battle they\u2019d heard about and-</p>\n<p>And Derek finds an excuse just after midday, after helping fix a fence damaged in the attack, to sneak into the woods. Because he\u2019s positive the Fury must be dead, he is, he just\u2026 he still has to check.</p>\n<p>Luckily, he is known for being quiet and for wandering away without explanation sometimes. No one thinks to question where he is going.</p>\n<p>He finds the spot where he and Cora had been attacked easily enough, the smell of fear and desperation still lingering in the air and the splash of blood against a tree an easy sign. He shifts, enhancing his senses further and then follows the trajectory that he thinks he threw the human.</p>\n<p>His instinct leads him even further away from the village to the edge of a canyon. The drop is steep and the area itself isn\u2019t big \u2013 a small spring of water, a patch of trees, and not much else, and, as a werewolf, he could jump down without breaking anything, but he\u2019d have to climb up. There\u2019s no way a human survived falling into this. No way.</p>\n<p>Derek is about to leave, content with the smell of blood as proof that the Fury is dead when he hears it.</p>\n<p>A heartbeat.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s faint and uneven and even with its help, it takes Derek a full minute of scanning the clearing before he finally spots the small heap that must be the human. It\u2019s down on the far side of the canyon, almost completely hidden by a tall oak tree and- Derek jumps down before he thinks about it.</p>\n<p>He knows what he has to do. Furies are <em>dangerous</em>.\u00a0 Furies are fire and smoke and a funeral he barely remembers. He lands almost silently and makes sure his hands are fully shifted into claws and then slowly moves forward.</p>\n<p>The Fury\u2019s heartbeat doesn\u2019t change. It doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s here.</p>\n<p>Derek moves less cautiously as he comes closer and it\u2019s then that he sees the reason the Fury doesn\u2019t mind his presence. It\u2019s asleep. Well, unconscious is the better word. It\u2019s \u00a0partly on its side, sprawled under the tree that must have finally stopped its movement, half covered in twigs and branches that haven\u2019t yet lost their leafs.</p>\n<p>He waits a few more heartbeats, then he goes and finally gets a good look at it. Perhaps the first real look any werewolf has ever gotten of a Fury.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\u2026</p>\n<p>It\u2019s young is the first thing Derek realizes. In his head, all humans are old and grizzled, muscled and scarred from years of attacking and killing werewolves. Their skin is thick and leathery from the sun and marked with tattoos that only make them look more nightmarish but this one\u2026</p>\n<p>This one looks younger than even Derek. It\u2019s hair is strange \u2013 cropped fairly shot in the middle, but then practically shaved on the sides. It doesn\u2019t even have facial hair yet, the only marks on its face a few dark dots that form a pattern up his jawline and it\u2019s- his? \u2013 skin is more red than tan, his nose slightly upturned, eyelashes dark and thick where they rest against its cheek.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t stir, even as Derek bends down so they are less than a foot apart. Derek shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Its face is bruised and there\u2019s a trail of blood that runs from his hairline down the left side of his face and neck. One sleeve of its armor and shirt is torn off at the elbow, leaving its forearm scraped and exposed. That\u2019s not even taking into account its leg, which, even covered by its pants and hidden by branches, is obviously mangled.</p>\n<p>It looks\u2026 it looks like a werewolf. An unshifted werewolf, but still\u2026</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t look different. It could be Laura or Cora, a perfectly peaceful unshifted wolf.</p>\n<p>Except for the tattoos.</p>\n<p>They are even more visible in the daylight, dark black lines that stand out starkly against its pale skin. The ones that wrap around his hand and wrist look like nothing more than intricate patterns, thick and dark lines wrapping around themselves in way that\u2019s almost beautiful. It must have taken hours to complete.</p>\n<p>But the one on its neck is even more distinctive. Derek has never seen one before, has only ever heard them described broadly, as maybe some kind of animal, but this close, he can see it\u2019s not just any animal, it\u2019s a <em>wolf</em>.</p>\n<p>The wolf\u2019s mouth is open in a snarl, tongue sticking out grotesquely, its eyes angry and ears pressed almost flat against its head.</p>\n<p>It looks evil. And it reminds Derek what he has to do.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s shifted back into his base form, he realizes, too curious and relaxed to bother maintaining his beta shift.</p>\n<p>But he focuses now. Focuses and sets his claws against the Fury\u2019s neck and the thing must almost be dead anyway, because it doesn\u2019t even twitch at the feel of claws at its jugular and he should do it.</p>\n<p>He should slash across its flesh and across the howling wolf that the Fury wears like a badge of honor and he should stop looking at its face and focusing on its racing heartbeat and the fact that its skin is cold beneath his hand and there is pain bubbling right under the surface. He\u2019s never thought about taking pain from a human before, never considered the fact that if he can do it with other werewolves and animals, then he can help humans too because that\u2019s ridiculous, humans are <em>evil</em> and-</p>\n<p>He growls low in his throat. He has to do this. He has to keep the pack safe. He has to-</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He pushes away roughly and the Fury falls even further to the side but doesn\u2019t wake.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so weak, he assures himself. It\u2019s going to die whether or not Derek kills it. It\u2019s weak and injured and alone and it probably won\u2019t ever wake up.</p>\n<p>It will die and Derek won\u2019t have to kill it.</p>\n<p>He clings to that thought as he turns and runs, climbing up the wall of the valley in three easy bounds.</p>\n<p>He forces himself not to look back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, he returns and the Fury is not dead.</p>\n<p>He -it - is a few paces from where he was the day before and it isn\u2019t moving now but it\u2019s obvious it was trying to head for water. It\u2019s equally obvious it had failed. The stains of blood smeared into the ground don\u2019t reach to the spring and one hand is stretched towards the pool of blue but the Fury is passed out again, unmoving, and Derek would think it is finally dead except for the same faint heartbeat.</p>\n<p><em>A fighter</em>, Derek thinks to himself. <em>Stubborn.</em></p>\n<p>Not that it matters. Everything dies if it can\u2019t get to water and the Fury had barely made it three feet. It\u2019s not even halfway.</p>\n<p>He leaves without bothering to jump down and take a closer look.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two hours later, he\u2019s back. He doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d gone back to the village only to find that Cora had decided that Derek\u2019s first kill was worth possibly getting in trouble for disobeying their mother. He had gone back to find himself something of a hero, people slapping him on the back and congratulating him on a job well done, and then his mother sat him down and told him that she hadn\u2019t thought he had it in him, but now he <em>can</em> start training with the other teenagers as winter falls and-</p>\n<p>And he would love to say that he comes back to finish the job, to get the kill that everyone thinks he already has, but that would be a lie.</p>\n<p>Derek comes back to do the opposite.</p>\n<p>Derek still jumps down without thinking about it and it\u2019s only as he lands with a slight <em>thump</em> that he realizes something is different.</p>\n<p>The Fury is awake.</p>\n<p>He- <em>It</em> yelps as Derek straightens and Derek shifts instinctively, although it\u2019s obvious that the Fury can\u2019t take him. From the look of it, it hasn\u2019t even managed to make it to the water yet.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t move closer but the Fury drags itself away as if he had. It only manages to slide back a foot before curling forward to clutch its leg, gasping for breath. Derek takes a slow step forward. The Fury grits his teeth and drags himself backwards more quickly this time, only stopping when his back runs into a tree.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0QQzqPC.jpg\" alt width=\"1000\" height=\"590\">\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d the thing groans and Derek pauses only because it\u2019s a shock. He knows humans can talk, knows that they keep them separated when captured for training for that very reason, but in battle they rely on whistling signals that sound like birds if you don\u2019t know what to listen for and he\u2019d always assumed that they just\u2026 didn\u2019t. Or that if they did, he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand. \u201cG-get away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fury puts up one hand as Derek continues coming closer and it\u2019s probably supposed to be threatening but all that happens is a few sparks come out of the center of his palm. It sags immediately after as if that had taken more effort than it looked like.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t exactly feel worried. He keeps walking. Slowly but steadily, ignoring the angry glare that the Fury gives him even as it coughs, and groans, and then tries to raise his hand again only to drop it a moment later.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay the fuck away,\u201d it pulls itself back a little bit, dragging the back of its skull along the tree as if its neck isn\u2019t strong enough to stay upright. \u201cFucking- just leave me alone and I won\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>Its heart is beating too fast now. Fast enough that Derek can barely distinguish between heartbeats. It \u2013 he? \u2013 is sweating and there is still a trail of blood coming from his leg and-</p>\n<p>Derek would say something if it wasn\u2019t so hard to talk while shifted. And for all that he is fairly certain the Fury is too weak to hurt him, he isn\u2019t about to risk letting his guard down. So, he merely ignores all the half-formed curses and snarls that the Fury throws at him and keeps moving.</p>\n<p>When he bends down, he\u2019s almost not surprised to find that the Fury\u2019s right hand has been curled around a knife this whole time. It comes flying at his face with more speed then he would have thought possible, but he catches it easily. He doesn\u2019t mean to squeeze it\u2019s wrist hard but he applies pressure until the knife falls to the ground between them. To be safe, he grabs it and shoves it in his pocket.</p>\n<p>The Fury sags as if that was his last option and he knows it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Derek tries around his fangs as he reaches for the Fury.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck. You.\u201d</p>\n<p>If the human in front of him is scared, he\u2019s not showing it. His jaw is clenched and his glare never falters, even as his eyes flick to Derek\u2019s claws for a heartbeat before returning to his face.</p>\n<p>Then Derek reaches for his neck, purely because that\u2019s the easiest chunk of skin to get to, and whatever peace the human had made with death evaporates.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he gasps, reaching up to push feebly against Derek\u2019s wrist. \u201cPlease, don\u2019- there\u2019s nothin\u2019 <em>left</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek feels a flash of guilt that he ignores the human\u2019s pleas to stop but clearly the pain is getting to him because he\u2019s not exactly making sense so Derek can\u2019t be blamed. His skin is clammy under Derek\u2019s hand and Derek shifts back into base-form the moment he starts drawing pain because-</p>\n<p>Well, because it knocks him out of shifted-form the moment he starts taking it. There\u2019s too much but he forces himself to focus and-</p>\n<p>Most of it is coming from his leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re\u2019ou\u2026 doin\u2019?\u201d the human slurs, head dipping towards Derek as all his muscles relax.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelping,\u201d Derek supplies and then leaves it at that.</p>\n<p>Because, honestly, he\u2019s not sure. This is\u2026 this is <em>wrong</em>. Derek is a werewolf, a werewolf whose mother is the Alpha of one of the three Packs that make up the alliance and he is out here, in the middle of the day, when he should be helping his Pack, taking care of a <em>human</em>.</p>\n<p>Not even a regular human. A Fury. The dangerous, ruthless, <em>killer</em> type of human. The same kind of human that ignored the fighting to sneak through the village and get to his house and lite it up even though-</p>\n<p>He shakes his head.</p>\n<p>He can't look too deeply into it. It\u2019s bad enough that in his head, he is already referring to the Fury as a \u201che\u201d rather than an \u201cit.\u201d Humans are supposed to be \u201cits.\u201d They\u2019re monsters. Less than animals. Less than-</p>\n<p>The human\u2019s eyes slide shut and Derek takes that as a sign that he\u2019s taken enough pain for now.</p>\n<p>He stretches the Fury out, shifting him until only his head is resting on the root of the tree, and then moves down to the leg.</p>\n<p>He sees instantly why it isn\u2019t healing. The break is high, almost at the knee and bone isn\u2019t quite breaking the skin, but it\u2019s close. It seems to be just one break, but the two parts aren\u2019t close enough to knit back together. There\u2019s only one way to get them close enough and Derek isn\u2019t sure when he had decided to <em>nurse the Fury back to health</em> but-</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath, pulls in as much pain as he can, and snaps the bone back in place.</p>\n<p>The Fury wakes up with a scream.</p>\n<p>Derek lunges for his mouth, terrified that someone will hear the sounds of agony but as quickly as started, it\u2019s over. The human is breathing harshly, groaning around clamped teeth, and tears are streaming out from under closed eyes, down the side of his face, but he\u2019s not yelling.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry, sorry,\u201d Derek mutters. \u201cHad to do it. It will heal now.\u201d The sound of his voice just makes the human flinch. He shuts up. The break was a bad one. Even now that the bone is back in place, it will still take a couple hours to heal completely.</p>\n<p>Maybe more. It looks like the side of the Fury\u2019s face still hasn\u2019t healed over and it has been almost two full days since the attack. There must have been internal damage that took priority over his smaller injuries. Or his body had been too desperate to heal his leg.</p>\n<p>Or he was too weak from dehydration.</p>\n<p>Derek reaches for his canteen, scooting forward so that he can lift the human\u2019s head and press the bottle to his mouth. Unsurprisingly, the Fury turns his head away at first but the moment the water actually touches his lips, he starts gulping quickly enough that Derek has to pull the bottle away to keep him from choking.</p>\n<p>He breathes a sigh of relief when the human appears to be too far gone to really realize what\u2019s happening. They repeat the process a few times, pausing only when the human has to cough and stopping when he passes out again.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t really know what he\u2019s doing, but he forms a rough kind of pillow out of leaves and re-fills the canteen at the spring. Then he places that next to the Fury.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the human will be healed and gone by the next day. Hopefully he will go back to where he came from and he won\u2019t remember any of this and Derek won\u2019t have to worry about this anymore.</p>\n<p>The human is evil and Derek just wants-</p>\n<p>He wants things to go back to normal</p>\n<p>He stands to leave and then realizes he still has the human\u2019s knife in his pocket.</p>\n<p>After a beat of hesitation, he puts it next to the canteen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles comes to slowly. Too slowly. He must spend about ten minutes willing himself to wake up completely, screaming internally that he needs to get moving and check the surrounding area and find Scott and get to water and it still takes him too long.</p>\n<p>When he finally gets his eyes open, it\u2019s dark out. He blinks up into the night for a bit, forcing his mind to remember the events that led him here. There was his attempt to grab what looked like a young werewolf, only to find she wasn\u2019t alone (<em>stupid, should have checked, should have been more careful</em>), and then there was\u2026 There\u2019s a gap. A gap in his memory and that should scare him, because everyone knows (and he knows better than most) that if the weres get bored of draining your magic, or if you struggle too much, or get mouthy, then they go ahead and take some memories too.</p>\n<p>But in this case he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s just a head injury. Probably the same thing that ruined his leg.</p>\n<p>He tells himself that firmly but his heart starts beating a little faster anyway.</p>\n<p>(They already took too much from him. He barely remembers her and Scott filled him in on all the stories a thousand times but he doesn\u2019t, he can\u2019t-)</p>\n<p>He groans as a headache suddenly bursts to life across his temples. Groans and then breathes because he has to-</p>\n<p>He has to get out of here.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t die. He has to find Scott and they have to get back to his Dad and Melissa and-</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t let them starve. Not another. Not his Dad. Not Melissa.</p>\n<p>He has to move. He struggles to sit up, needing no reminder that his leg is broken because the stupid thing is still throbbing. His mouth is dry, although he has faint memories of drinking water. Of a werewolf <em>helping</em> him drink water.</p>\n<p>He knows what that means. He has to get out of here.</p>\n<p>The moon is almost full and it will have to provide enough light for him because he knows without checking that his magic is still tapped out. Which either means the werewolf from before sucked him dry again or he had never rejuvenated enough in the first place.</p>\n<p>He suspects the latter. He had been drained five days before the raid, which meant that even during the fight, he was only operating at half-capacity. And then there was the blast of light to distract the small werewolf and the attempt to burn the other while being stabbed and the pitiful excuse for fire-</p>\n<p>If the werewolf actually tried to drain him, well, it wasn\u2019t like there was any magic left for him to get. He shouldn\u2019t, but Stiles gets a sick sense of satisfaction at that.</p>\n<p>Only briefly though. Because Stiles knows what happens to emissaries captured by other packs. They are allowed to recover and then drained. Fully. To death. After all their memories are stolen and sorted for clues.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a canteen at his side, full, and Stiles only hesitates for a second before opening it and chugging as much as he can. Dying isn\u2019t an option. He doesn\u2019t know where he is but he can figure it out and his leg <em>hurts</em> but it doesn\u2019t seem to be as bad as he remembers it and he-</p>\n<p>As he puts the canteen back down, feeling slightly nauseous, it clinks against something.</p>\n<p>His knife.</p>\n<p>The werewolf had given him his knife back.</p>\n<p>For the first time since waking up, Stiles is truly surprised. Doubtless, all the wolfsbane has come off so it\u2019s not poisonous anymore, but he\u2019d carved the runes in it himself and he\u2019s sure it can still do damage to werewolves. It should have been taken from him.</p>\n<p>Maybe the werewolf didn\u2019t know.\u00a0Didn\u2019t bother looking closely enough that engravings etched into the side or didn\u2019t realize that they mean any wound it inflicts won\u2019t heal instantly.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s his mistake. The second Stiles gets enough magic, he can project this knife into the wolf\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been practicing his aim with Scott. When he managed to get enough magic that he could actually do it without Deucalion noticing he was lower than he should be.</p>\n<p>Not that he would be sticking around that long. He shakes his head, he doesn\u2019t know why he has the sense he\u2019s trapped. His leg is mangled but it can\u2019t be that bad and he can crawl and yet he still-</p>\n<p>A canyon.</p>\n<p>He goes still and squints into the darkness, part of the gap filling itself in.</p>\n<p>He fell \u2013 was thrown? \u2013 into a gully of some type.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s trapped. He can\u2019t get out. Not until his leg heals at least a little.</p>\n<p>Something in his stomach sinks and his clutches his knife tighter and decides he can\u2019t deal with this just yet.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s entirely too easy to fall into darkness once more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, training starts and the only word Derek can think to describe it is bizarre.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s bizarre because he is something of a celebrity at the moment or at least Cora has made his fight with the human (thank the gods she didn\u2019t realize it was a Fury) seem dramatic enough that people won\u2019t stop talking about it. So when he arrives at the training with the five other young werewolves, there\u2019s more than a few looks. And, for once, they aren\u2019t pitying looks.</p>\n<p>It should make him feel better, but it doesn\u2019t. Because the entire opening speech is about how humans are ruthless monsters that have been attacking werewolf packs for generations and how they are callous enough that the bands tattooed around their arms signal the number of kills or captures they have and how it is the duty of all werewolves to destroy them on sight and-</p>\n<p>And all Derek can think about is how <em>young</em> the Fury looked and how scared he was when he scrambled away from Derek and how desperate his voice was when he told him to stay away, when he told him there was nothing left (whatever that means).</p>\n<p>He keeps his face neutral and tries to tell himself that it was a special case, that the Fury was <em>injured</em> and, really, werewolves kill in battle but they don\u2019t track down injured humans and kill them in cold-blood. Any other werewolf would have made the same decision. And the Fury is probably gone by now but if not, maybe they could learn something by studying him or asking questions or-</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the number one strategy when fighting humans?\u201d Satomi snaps. Derek blinks and straightens. The speech is clearly over and, according to the laws of the Alliance, all Alphas are to be treated with the same respect as your own.</p>\n<p>\u201cAim to kill,\u201d Erica pipes up.</p>\n<p>Satomi shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not strategy,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just a fact. I want to know <em>how</em> you are going to fight them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUse our superior strength?\u201d Isaac asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot bad. But not the number one rule.\u201d</p>\n<p>There a few heartbeats of silence. When Derek glances around at the other werewolves, he sees that most of them have given up. Erica is looking a little annoyed that her aim to kill plan wasn\u2019t the right answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook up?\u201d Derek finally asks, just to break the silence. Satomi is known for her patience. They could be there all day otherwise.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sure it\u2019s wrong but the Fury had definitely dropped from <em>above</em> them so-</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Satomi says. She is the oldest of the three Alphas, and not one for outward displays of happiness, but her mouth quirks up for a moment. \u201cNow, we know that humans are not as strong as us, but they are aware of this themselves. Which means they have found ways to adapt, the biggest being their reliance on surprise and tricks, the most basic of which is utilizing their surroundings, particularly the trees\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She continues and Derek keeps his eyes on her. Partly because it\u2019s polite and Satomi will doubtless report to his mother how he is doing, partly to avoid the half-shocked, half-jealous looks of his fellow trainees.</p>\n<p>Mostly, though, mostly so that he can make it seem like he is still listening even as he wonders if the Fury will still be there when he gets back to the gully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek almost doesn\u2019t go. Satomi\u2019s idea of initial training is cardio so his afternoon had been spent running almost nonstop and then dinner is a forced recap of the running that is almost as exhausting as the running itself and-</p>\n<p>He tells himself a thousand times that the Fury must be gone by now but as dusk falls, he packs up a second meal (he has a feeling he\u2019s going to be hungry again later even though usually werewolves are just fine on one meal a day) and heads out.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like your father,\u201d his mother says as he nods his goodbye. Her smile has gone soft and sad. \u201cHe always needed his alone time too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods silently because he doesn\u2019t exactly remember much about his father and then seriously considers staying because he is going to maybe help the same kind of thing that <em>killed</em> his father, but\u2026</p>\n<p>He\u2019s only going to make sure the thing is gone.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>Derek frowns as he looks down into the canyon. The Fury is awake now, sitting by the spring, armor in a pile next to him, chest stripped bare. Derek watches as he reaches a wad of clothing that must be his shirt into the pool of water and then shoves it with a hiss onto his stomach.</p>\n<p>Where Derek stabbed him with his claws just a few nights ago. Still not healed.</p>\n<p>He takes a step closer to the edge of the canyon. The movement draws the Fury\u2019s attention. Derek isn\u2019t close enough to hear his heartbeat, but his eyes land on Derek\u2019s and his chest rises as he takes a deep breath.</p>\n<p>Derek wishes he knew what he was doing but he jumps down anyway. To simply stare from above seems rude. And he is already in too deep. He can\u2019t just let the Fury die on him now. Not when Derek already saved him.</p>\n<p>The human doesn\u2019t say anything as he walks closer. Just glares at him, and clutches the shirt to his side. Up close, he is lean but muscular, more than a few scars littering the expanse of his skin. And without his shirt, Derek can see that the tattoo on his neck and hands are actually connected. The head of the wolf flows into a body which sits on his shoulder, two of the paws across his collarbone, the back two on his upper bicep. All the curved lines that loop around his arm down to his hands are actually the tail.</p>\n<p>The other arm is bare. No bars. Derek finds that reassuring. The Fury might have been attacking his village but he hadn\u2019t killed anyone yet. Maybe this had been his very first mission.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s good. That makes it so Derek didn\u2019t save a killer. He saved someone\u2026 well, not innocent. It had been grabbing Cora but at least he\u2019s not a killer. Any other werewolf would have done the same.</p>\n<p>Derek blinks and tells himself to stop staring.</p>\n<p>The human\u2019s heart isn\u2019t beating as quickly as it had been before but it\u2019s still not steady. Derek makes sure both of his hands are up. Last time, even though he was dehydrated and half-passed out, the Fury had managed to shoot a little fire from his hands. And try to stab him. Derek isn\u2019t taking any chances.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou here to kill me?\u201d the human asks, gritting his teeth and sitting up a little straighter. It almost sounds like a taunt.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek replies. The Fury looks at him steadily for a moment. Satomi had told them that human hearing wasn\u2019t as advanced as werewolves, that they didn\u2019t think humans could even hear heartbeats, wouldn\u2019t be able to tell if you lied to them, but it seems like the Fury is checking for something.</p>\n<p>After a beat, he\u2026 well, he doesn\u2019t relax exactly but some of the tension goes out of his body. He allows himself to sag back once more. At least, he does after he reaches for his knife again and rams it into the ground so it\u2019s within easy reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says and then looks back at his stomach, peeling back his shirt to poke at the half-closed wounds.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still \u2026\u201d he starts, eyes flickering down to the Fury\u2019s chest again. The human looks up at him. Saying \u201cinjured\u201d seems rude. Derek clears his throat and changes the word. \u201cHere. You\u2019re still here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fury glares at him. \u201cHow would I be gone already? You stabbed me. And broke my leg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but,\u201d Derek tries. \u201cThat was three days ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even the deepest wound should have been healed by now. Unless there was wolfsbane along the blade but it\u2019s not like Derek had rubbed his claws in wolfsbane. Only humans used those kinds of tactics.</p>\n<p>The Fury\u2019s eyes squint in judgment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, shouldn\u2019t you be healed?\u201d Derek asks. It comes out a little bit growly. He doesn\u2019t need this humans\u2019 judgment. He needs him to be gone and out of Derek\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t use my own magic on myself, dude,\u201d the Fury says, frowning down at his gut again. \u201cUnless\u2026 can your emissaries do that? Did they figure out a way?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks. He has no idea what this kid talking about. Emissaries? The kid looks back up at him, almost eager.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, feeling something twist in his gut as the human\u2019s face falls. \u201cNo, I mean, we don\u2019t have emi-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d the Fury cuts in as Derek hesitates over the unfamiliar word. For no reason, his heart has started beating faster again. \u201cRight, you guys don\u2019t keep things like me around.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mouth twists but he doesn\u2019t sound too upset or surprised. Derek frowns. If emissaries are Furies then it\u2019s not like werewolves would want them nearby. They literally spend their whole life training to <em>kill werewolves</em>. And everyone knows that Furies are the most ruthless, that they can create a ring of Mountain Ash with a wave of their hand around a werewolf and hold it in place while other humans cross the line and-</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not even counting the fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re keeping me around at least for a little bit, right?\u201d the Fury asks. He doesn\u2019t seem surprised by that either. Or grateful. God, if Derek\u2019s mom found out about this- \u201cI\u2019m no good to anyone like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, he waves a hand at his neck rather than his leg but maybe that\u2019s a human thing.</p>\n<p>At a loss for what else to do, Derek nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d the Fury says, grinning sarcastically. \u201cThen I assume you\u2019re going to feed me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Derek says. He thought the Fury would be gone by now. But he did bring a bag full of extra food so, \u201cYeah. Here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fury\u2019s hand curls around his knife again as Derek approaches, holding the bag out in front of him. In a heartbeat, it is snatched away and Derek skips back a few steps. Then watches as the human opens the bag and stuffs a huge bite of bread in his mouth.</p>\n<p>Well, that makes sense. It has been three days. At least.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Derek,\u201d Derek offers after a minute. The Fury pauses in chewing to look at him. Derek doesn\u2019t know why he feels that he just made a fool of himself but he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you want me to call you\u2026?\u201d The Fury says after swallowing. His voice is hard again, playful only on the surface. \u201cLet me guess- \u2018my lord and master\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat- no,\u201d Derek says, frowning. \u201cI just told you. My name is Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fury looks at him as if he\u2019s not quite right in the head. Doesn\u2019t respond aside from twitching one shoulder up in what could be acceptance. Goes back to eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Derek finally prompts, timing his question for when the Fury has finished the loaf of bread and not yet found the strips of jerky at the bottom of the bag. He\u2019ll have to bring more food next time. The human looks thin to the point of sickly.</p>\n<p>His question earns him another mistrustful glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d The Fury finally says. \u201cIf we\u2019re using names. I prefer \u2018annoying shithead\u2019 if you\u2019re planning on derogatory terms.\"</p>\n<p>Derek frowns at his tone. Half challenge, half casual acceptance.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re the wolf with the food,\u201d the human- Stiles \u2013 says, waving a piece of jerky in the air for a moment before biting it and continuing with his mouth full. \u201cSo what you say goes, boss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Derek corrects. He still feels like he is being mocked somehow. He needs to get this human out of here. \u201cHow long will this take?\u201d He waves a hand in the Fury\u2019s general direction, trying to encapsulate both the time necessary for his leg and his stomach to heal.</p>\n<p>Stiles goes\u2026 well, not still but forcibly relaxed. He stares down at his own leg for a bit then glances back up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least three weeks,\u201d he admits, mouth twisting. \u201cMaybe more.\u201d</p>\n<p>His heart skips. Derek doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019s lying.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat long?\u201d he asks. God, humans take <em>forever</em> to heal. It explains why most often it is the smell of blood that gives them away later in the raiding season.</p>\n<p>\u201cRegenerating takes time,\u201d Stiles replies. At least that isn\u2019t a lie. Derek mentally shrugs. Alright, well, formal training is a full month so he\u2019ll have plenty of excuses to be eating more. It will just be a matter of finding the time to sneak away. \u201cYou can\u2019t rush perfection.\u201d</p>\n<p>Speaking of, it\u2019s probably time for him to head home. He\u2019s exhausted and he\u2019s going to have to think of some creative excuses that won\u2019t set off his mother\u2019s lie detector to use these next few weeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fury nods. \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d The sarcasm is back, cheerful and biting.</p>\n<p>Briefly, Derek considers apologizing, because it is his fault that Stiles\u2019 leg is broken, that he is stuck at the bottom of this gully for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>But, no. Stiles had been attacking his <em>sister</em>. He doesn\u2019t even deserve Derek's help, let alone his apology.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d The Fury\u2019s voice stops him as he turns to leave. It\u2019s softer and serious and Stiles is carefully looking down at his stomach in a weak attempt at nonchalance. \u201cDid- Any kills?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s jaw clenches. <em>Kills</em>, Stiles calls them. Like they don\u2019t matter. Like they are some score to be kept track of-</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snaps. \u201cYou didn\u2019t manage to kill any of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles must sense his tone but still doesn\u2019t look up.</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes and goes to leave again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you guys?\u201d Stiles asks. His eyes flick up and then back down again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026 you bag any?\u201d</p>\n<p>His words are crude but he\u2019s holding his breath. His heart is beating too fast again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, feeling his anger fade. Stiles glances up at him again before his head drops into a short nod. \u201cNo, we captured three though. They\u2019re all older, I think. Experienced.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t seen them yet, but from what he\u2019s heard, they all have kills to their name. They\u2019re not like Stiles. Not innocent.</p>\n<p>\u201cCaptured?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cWhat does-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t kill them,\u201d Derek offers. \u201cAt least, not\u2026 not right away.\u201d</p>\n<p>They will at the end. Whichever one is the strongest will go up against whoever is doing the best in training during the Winter Solstice and it\u2019s a festival of sorts- anger and revenge and rebellion all rolled into one.</p>\n<p>It had never been his favorite day, he\u2019d actually managed to avoid the fight altogether for the past few years or so but now-</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Stiles replies and then he stuffs the last of the food into his mouth.</p>\n<p>Derek wants to ask then. Wants to ask what happens to the people who are taken far enough away that the bonds of pack fade and then disappear altogether.</p>\n<p>But instead he turns and leaves.</p>\n<p>He thinks Stiles just gave him the answer anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>End Chapter 1.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chapter 2</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that Stiles trusts the werewolf. He doesn\u2019t. He knows full well that Derek is a werewolf and that werewolves see humans as tools and nothing more and he has not forgotten for an instant that he is the enemy.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t Scott. He doesn\u2019t believe that humans and werewolves can coexist in peace or that some of them might be good somewhere. He doesn\u2019t worry about the morality of what they do or what they are forced to be.</p>\n<p>So there is no trust.</p>\n<p>But there is <em>reliance</em>.</p>\n<p>Stiles simply can\u2019t hunt for himself at the moment. His leg won\u2019t take his weight and he doesn\u2019t have a fishing line to try to catch the fish he can see in the spring and his magic is returning too slowly to try using that for at least a week.</p>\n<p>So, like it or not, he is stuck waiting for Derek to bring food every night.\u00a0 And Derek seems to know that because there is never enough for more than one meal. Two if he stretches it.</p>\n<p>Stiles knows what that means. Hunger is a powerful tool for keeping people in line. The entire population of Beacon Hills is controlled by it. And there\u2019s no real way to fight it. Deucalion and his pack are the ones that hunt and scare off game so that the humans can\u2019t and- well, the only way to rebel is to let yourself slowly starve to death so that your husband and son live even though neither of them would want you to do that and it turns out your son is an emissary anyway so your dream of keeping him away from the fighting squads is never going to come true and-</p>\n<p>Maybe that makes it easier. That Stiles is used to relying on werewolves for food. That years of dependence made it so he\u2019s long used to the sting of embarrassment when Derek hands him the basket and Stiles snatches it quickly and starts eating before Derek can change his mind.</p>\n<p>Up to this point, Derek hasn\u2019t shown any sign of playing that particular trick. In fact, he hasn\u2019t seemed threatening at all. He\u2019s young, maybe Stiles\u2019 age, and always careful. He doesn\u2019t come too close and puts his hands up when Stiles snatches the basket away. Even his voice is always patient and calm. Basically, he is confusing. And, really, he appears just as confused by Stiles as Stiles is of him. Overall, it\u2019s not a bad deal.</p>\n<p>The only thing that Stiles doesn\u2019t like is the way that Derek lingers.</p>\n<p>Stiles gets being a kept pet of sorts, gets that Derek is giving him some time to recover before sucking him dry, even gets that Derek seems to be keeping him a secret \u2013 his own private emissary to feed off of whenever he desires. Derek has told him enough that he knows he is in training right now. Being suddenly faster and stronger than the others will give him a distinct advantage once Stiles has enough to take. It makes sense. Stiles understands it. Accepts it, even.</p>\n<p>He just doesn\u2019t understand why Derek uses the time Stiles spends inhaling the first few bites of food to re-fill Stiles\u2019 (well, it is technically Derek\u2019s) canteen from the spring, even though Stiles has gotten pretty good at crawling over to fill it himself. He doesn\u2019t understand why Derek sees that he\u2019s shivering one night and the next day brings a blanket.</p>\n<p>The cold isn\u2019t life threatening yet. Derek shouldn\u2019t have cared.</p>\n<p>Mostly, though, he doesn\u2019t understand why Derek insists on making conversation. Random conversation too, awkward questions or halting stories about his life that Stiles at first frantically analyzes for clues and refuses to let himself respond to. If Stiles is being secretly interrogated for information about Deucalion, it is the strangest interrogation style he\u2019s ever heard of.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably not an interrogation, though. If Derek wanted information on the Alpha pack, all he had to do was dig into Stiles\u2019 neck and take it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Derek says as Stiles tears into the loaf of bread he\u2019d brought. Stiles is already rolling his eyes. That tone of voice tells him that Derek is going to go for an awkward question. \u201cYou must, uh, I mean those tattoos are pretty impressive. You must like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unbidden, memories rise to the surface. Memories of struggling, of screaming that they made a mistake, of being held down as claws sunk into his neck for the first time, stealing away something he had just started to recognize was a part of himself. Memories of pushing back. Of flinging one of them across the room before his magic could be dragged out of him.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when they first took parts of her. When he tried to get them away from him. He didn\u2019t even realize it at first. The gaps were small and\u2026 well, you can\u2019t miss what isn\u2019t there. He\u2019d kept struggling, kept telling them off and figuring out ways to use his power so that there wouldn\u2019t be any left to take, even though they kept digging at his neck anyway. They couldn\u2019t keep him still enough to tattoo him. Stupidly, he thought that was winning.</p>\n<p>And then one day, he\u2019s gone home and heard Melissa telling his father that \u201cClaudia would be proud\u201d and he realized he had no idea who Claudia was. His father and Scott were terrified and he suddenly saw all the holes that were in his mind, moments that didn\u2019t line up because there was no set up or stories he no longer knew the ending to.</p>\n<p>It changed then. He stopped struggling and focused on lying down and forcing himself to stay still while watching in terror as a hollow needle was filled with ink and then stabbed into him over and over, pausing only occasionally when Ennis had to stop to wipe away blood.</p>\n<p>It had taken almost three full days. It still takes a solid five hours when they decide it has faded too much and has to be re-traced.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, honestly though he doesn\u2019t know why. \u201cI hate needles.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being sarcastic,\u201d Derek mutters and that\u2019s funny enough that Stiles barks a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replies, still grinning because, what else is there to do? \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, why\u2026?\u201d Derek fades off, eyes flicking again over the prominent wolf on his neck\u00a0 and trailing down to his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly a choice, dude,\u201d Stiles tells him. Derek is frowning again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, all Furies have to get them?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 tradition?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at that. It\u2019s not quite the wording he would have chosen but, okay, tradition works.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to say than \u201cpossessive marking intended to put fear into other werewolves, mark them as separate from other humans, and make it easier for Deucalion to run his hand up people\u2019s shoulders and feel the raised lines even though he\u2019s blind so he knows who to feed off of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all emissaries,\u201d he offers, letting his voice go dark. He feels Derek\u2019s eyes on him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you\u2026 <em>like</em> being a Fu- emissary?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up to glare at him, half wondering if this is some sort of joke. Does he like being used as essentially a human regenerating snack? Or letting werewolves take his magic so they can feel more powerful whenever they want? Or only being allowed to use his magic when he\u2019s in battle, out killing other werewolves so the Alphas can spread their power?</p>\n<p>Is Derek fucking crazy?</p>\n<p>Then again\u2026 he likes that he automatically gets food from the Alphas even if he doesn\u2019t make any kills. He likes that he can share that with his father and Melissa and that they probably won\u2019t starve. He likes storing up some magic and then trying to come up with new ways to use it. He likes that he has learned to boost Scott\u2019s speed and strength when they\u2019re fighting, that he figured out a trick that at least manages Scott\u2019s breathing problems, that he can blast werewolves away from Scott if they get too close.</p>\n<p>He hates it. But maybe he wouldn\u2019t change it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he allows.</p>\n<p>Silence descends.</p>\n<p>Then,</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I?\u201d Derek asks, putting up a hand.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the other thing Stiles doesn\u2019t get about Derek. Almost every time before leaving, he offers to take some of Stiles\u2019 pain. It makes no sense and Stiles refused the first few times on principle but then-</p>\n<p>Well, he\u2019d allowed it once and Derek hadn\u2019t taken the opportunity to flip him over and sink his claws in so\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he agrees, gripping his knife harder as Derek approaches.</p>\n<p>Reliance. Not trust.</p>\n<p>Still, as he has before, Derek moves slowly and curls his hand around Stiles\u2019 ankle rather than his neck and then-</p>\n<p>Stiles lets out a sigh of relief without meaning to. The consistent throb of his leg fades, as do the sharp stings of cuts and uncomfortableness of bug bites and-</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em>is</em> that?\u201d Derek growls. Stiles blinks at him, uncertain why the werewolf sounds so frustrated. \u201cThe feeling around your stomach, it\u2019s not- I can\u2019t get <em>rid</em> of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles considers and then tilts his head to the side, squinting.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hunger,\u201d He shrugs. \u201cNo big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a constant in his life that Stiles is long used to. He and Scott have a rule: their parents first. Always. Stiles has his own rule: Scott before him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHunger?\u201d Derek repeats. \u201cBut I give you food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, one meal a day isn\u2019t exactly gonna cut it,\u201d he tells Derek, twitching his leg as a signal for Derek to stop. Derek lets go and leans back, but doesn\u2019t stand. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining!\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s really not. The food isn\u2019t much but it\u2019s good \u2013 better than he would get at Beacon Hills and Stiles suspects he\u2019s stealing it from his own pack.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many meals are you <em>supposed</em> to have?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I know I\u2019m an emissary but I\u2019m still human, dude. We need about three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em>day</em>?!\u201d Derek sounds scandalized. It makes Stiles laugh. And not even in a sarcastic way.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t all have super-efficient digestive systems like you wolves,\u201d he says. And then goes quiet. Because he doesn\u2019t remember her, but he still <em>knows. </em></p>\n<p>His dad had just suffered the wound that put him off the fighting squads forever, he and Claudia decided that bringing another child into the world wasn\u2019t worth it \u2013 not even for the extra food they were guaranteed while she was pregnant, Stiles was too young and his mother had made the decision to stop eating. To give her food to him.</p>\n<p>He knows the stories well enough that he feels like he should remember them \u2013<em> she spent the last three weeks in bed, still refusing to eat, she used to hum to you as she lay there, you begged her to eat, we buried her behind the willow tree in the woods </em>\u2013 but he doesn\u2019t feel anything. Just general sadness and guilt because she died for him and he will never remember the songs she used to hum. He can\u2019t even remember what she looked like.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles says, cutting Derek off almost roughly, even though he should have learned his lesson by now about being rude to werewolves. He just wishes Derek wasn\u2019t here right now. That <em>he</em> wasn\u2019t here. That she hadn\u2019t \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m nowhere close to starving to death. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes weeks to do that, months if the gaps in his head are anything to go by.</p>\n<p>Derek must sense his mood because he leaves without asking any more stupid questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day, Derek arrives later than usual but with four times the usual amount of food. Maybe five.</p>\n<p>Stiles gapes at him and Derek <em>blushes</em>, like he\u2019s embarrassed. Which doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could sneak away that much every night,\u201d Derek warns as Stiles still stares dumbly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis- I,\u201d Stiles clears his throat and starts again. \u201cThis won\u2019t make me fill up any faster.\u201d For once, he was actually telling the truth. The wait time is something that annoys the Alphas the most and judging by the fact that they still give the emissaries the same amount they give those who made only one kill (aka next to nothing), he doubts the extra food will help.</p>\n<p>Though he will be eating more than he ever has in his life if Derek can bring this much even three times a week. Hell, if he manages it four times, Stiles will have enough to last the journey back and still have some to spare for Scott and their parents.</p>\n<p>Derek hasn\u2019t challenged his request to wait three weeks before draining him yet. In fact, the longer Stiles could put it off, the better for his leg. Broken bones take at least three weeks to heal, but if he can convince Derek his magic at four would be even better\u2026</p>\n<p>He snaps his eyes away from the food, worried that somehow just the smell of deceit will make Derek suspicious. When he looks up, Derek is frowning in confusion.</p>\n<p>Then he shakes himself and looks disappointed. Stiles tenses.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. I thought,\u201d the werewolf stops and shakes himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it won\u2019t help you heal faster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at the wording (<em>sorry? Heal?</em>) but Derek cocks his head as if listening and then bends down and starts taking pain without asking.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunts as Stiles gasps in part shock and part relief. \u201cI think someone\u2019s following me. Gotta go.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s gone an instant later. Stiles turns it over in his head for a moment before refocusing.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have time to figure Derek out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek never intended to become good at training. He certainly never meant to use what he learned from Stiles to hunt down the same seven humans they release and capture over and over again.</p>\n<p>But, hanging out with Stiles has helped him. Humans still disguise their scent with a variety of techniques, but being around Stiles has made his nose even more sensitive to what exactly a human smells like. He can pick out the difference between human heartbeats and animal ones and now that he knows humans actually have to eat three times a day instead of just once, he quickly figures out that the older captives, the ones who have been there for a few months, almost always head towards the gardens rather than try for the forest.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, he knows that humans can communicate. He knows they\u2019re probably in pain. He is starting to think that maybe they don\u2019t want to fight either. At least, Stiles doesn\u2019t seem to hate him.</p>\n<p>Since Derek realized he was accidentally starving the Fury, Stiles had been\u2026 well\u2026 <em>friendly</em> is too strong a word and <em>polite</em> was the wrong word entirely but\u2026</p>\n<p>Stiles is relaxing. At least a little. He no longer holds his knife when Derek arrives (though it\u2019s always within arm\u2019s reach) and his gaze has gone considering rather than accusing and Derek can\u2019t be sure, but it seems to him that every so often he lets himself smile, just a little bit, at whatever story Derek is trying to tell that day.</p>\n<p>A real smile, too. Not the hard smirk that still pops up at inappropriate times.</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe that is Stiles hating him, maybe he\u2019s reading this all wrong or just hoping that-</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Satomi\u2019s voice jars him out of his musings on Stiles. He tries not to flush. He shouldn\u2019t be thinking about the Fury anyway.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s important. It\u2019s been ten days since training started and today, Satomi is allowing them to finally fight an actual human in hand-to-hand combat. He\u2019s young, Satomi explains as Derek refocuses, but humans literally train since birth to kill werewolves. He\u2019s not going to be easy to take down.</p>\n<p>He also already has two bands around his right bicep. They all know what that means.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo killing it,\u201d Satomi instructs softly, only loud enough for the werewolves to hear. That\u2019s always the rule. They need the humans to train with. \u201cThough, remember, it is not operating under those assumptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hangs back and watches. The human had been resting in the back of his cage, legs bent and arms resting on top. At Satomi\u2019s growl, he rises and comes out of his cage blinking in the sunlight, clearly confused \u2013 maybe even waiting for an order. Usually they try to arrange it so that the humans honestly think they have escaped somehow. No need to bother with that this time. It\u2019s going to be fairly obvious what they expect the human to do.</p>\n<p>Kill or be killed.</p>\n<p>Derek watches as he spots the small ring of werewolves and then the sword on the ground nearby. There\u2019s a flash of fear in his eyes as he assesses the situation but it\u2019s gone almost immediately. Because it has to be. In an instant, he\u2019s darting forward and grabbing the sword, spinning it as he readjusts his grip as if to get used to the weight.</p>\n<p>Erica steps forward to take him on first, something like a smirk dancing on her face. She swings and it should be too fast for a human to follow but the human seems to read where she <em>will</em> be and then-</p>\n<p>A moment later Erica is somehow flung across the dirt and Satomi motions for her to stay down. Her rule is that humans generally attack in groups and if she thinks you would be dead in an actual battle, you are out of training as well.</p>\n<p>Isaac goes next and he\u2019s more cautious than Erica, but easily frustrated and it takes longer, but the result is the same. Isaac ends up declared dead without even touching the human. Brett and Sam are next and they sort of try to attack together, but Derek thinks it just makes both of them fumble into one another\u2019s space and get in their own way. Or maybe that\u2019s the human too, the way he manipulates it so they are attacking from the same direction.</p>\n<p>By the time Boyd steps up, the human is panting and for a moment, his eyes flick to the side, as if expecting someone to be there who\u2019s not, and the mistake costs him. Boyd swings and the human jumps back but not quite enough. Derek sees the punch catch him on the chin and he knows from personal experience that Boyd hits hard, but the human allows himself a mere moment to scramble back and blink before striking forward again.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t know when exactly the human managed to figure out that Boyd is strong but not fast but the next two minutes are dominated by the human running literal circles around the werewolf. Eventually Boyd missteps and the human swings the hilt of his sword down on Boyd\u2019s temple.</p>\n<p>The human turns to face him, gasping now, reaching his free hand to his throat as if trying to rub something away, and Derek-</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t want to fight him. He looks like he\u2019s the same age as Stiles and he\u2019s clearly winning but he doesn\u2019t look happy about it. He doesn\u2019t look proud of himself or excited about the fight or smug that he is taking werewolves out so easily. He just looks\u2026</p>\n<p>He looks sad almost. Sad and defeated even though he isn\u2019t. Well, not yet.</p>\n<p>His eyes flick to the opening of the training ring even as he holds his sword pointed at Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek wants to let him go.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xdBNtvS.jpg\" alt width=\"999\" height=\"619\">\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Satomi orders. \u201cStop hesitating. In battle it will cost you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek watches the human refocus.</p>\n<p>Derek rushes him. Satomi is an Alpha.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not quite sure what he\u2019s going to do as he has no real intention of hitting the human, but when there is a sword suddenly swinging at his stomach, he knows enough to spin away and grab the human\u2019s wrist to stop it and-</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even think about it. There is pain there: new, sharp pain across his jaw, doubtless from Boyd\u2019s punch, old aches across his shoulder from when he was captured, and a tight pain radiating from his stomach that Derek recognizes as hunger.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all there. Simmering under the surface and Derek does what comes naturally.</p>\n<p>He pulls, trying to grab as much as he can in the brief moment it will be socially acceptable for him to be touching this human.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not ready for the human to gasp, freeze, and then sag in his arms.</p>\n<p>Panicking, Derek spins again and throws the human over his shoulder, hoping it looks like some sort of wrestling move rather than the human suddenly going limp on him. He supposes it works well enough because in an instant, he has the human on his back, claws pressed to his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Satomi says into the sudden silence. Derek is gasping as well now, a bit lightheaded from taking all that pain. \u201cYou see how Derek got in close so that the human couldn\u2019t use its speed against him? That and grabbing onto his arm allowed Derek to use his superior strength. For the next week, we will be practicing wrestling moves\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Satomi continues even as she walks over to grab the human by the back of his neck and drag him back into his cell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The human is still panting, but his eyes lock on Derek as he allows himself to be pulled away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0They are glossy and still sad and yet there\u2019s a hint of surprise. A question there that Derek doesn\u2019t know how to answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should stop, Derek knows. In real battle, he won\u2019t be able to do this and Erica and the others are getting more and more suspicious of his ability to take down humans so easily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0He <em>tries</em> to stop, tries to remind himself that the humans aren\u2019t all like Stiles or that first young human, that the others have four or more bands wrapping around their arms and come out swinging to kill, that this strategy doesn\u2019t make sense because it won\u2019t work against a healthy human and it sometimes leaves him weak and shaky if they are too injured and-</p>\n<p>He tries to stop and when he can\u2019t, he thinks about coming clean. Considers the fact that maybe it <em>could</em> be a real strategy, that it seems to leave the humans limp with relief, at least long enough so that they could be captured but-</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t. Because it would mean revealing how he found out that he could do this and because he doesn\u2019t know how to put it and because he just-</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t get Stiles out of his mind. And he doesn\u2019t want humans to be captured.</p>\n<p>So he doesn\u2019t stop and doesn\u2019t tell and against the other werewolves, he\u2019s still the worst at fighting, but against humans?</p>\n<p>Against humans, he\u2019s getting a reputation. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s suspicious and he knows it. His mother is too busy to really comment on it aside from near constant prodding at the dinner table to tell his sisters how well he\u2019s doing and Laura is surprised but above it but Cora\u2026</p>\n<p>Cora has taken to staring at Derek more and more as if he is a puzzle that she can figure out if she can just get the opportunity. She asks for more detailed questions at dinner and openly questions where Derek goes after dinner (to which he says \u201caround\u201d which is entirely unconvincing) and the kicker is when Erica shows up to training and laughingly tells him that his little sister thought they were sneaking around together.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s even more embarrassing when Isaac admits that she had cornered and interrogated him as well.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s bad enough that he takes to <em>actually</em> going on long wandering walks after dinner, avoiding the canyon completely and trying not to feel worried that he can\u2019t be with Stiles until sneaking out well past midnight. But he knows she\u2019s following him and if he tried to shake her off <em>too</em> badly, it would be obvious he was hiding something and-</p>\n<p>\u201cCora!\u201d he finally yells after almost a week of this, spinning around and glaring at the direction he knows she\u2019s hiding in. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop stalking me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Predictably, she first attempts to go very still and pretend she\u2019s not there.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Derek growls. His eyes might flash if they weren\u2019t already shifted to see in the growing darkness. He can\u2019t have her doing this anymore. He\u2019s getting tired and cranky and he doesn\u2019t like that sometimes Stiles is fast asleep when he gets there but snaps awake if Derek gets within fifteen feet. \u201cCora.\u201d</p>\n<p>She steps out then and doesn\u2019t bother pretending she wasn\u2019t following him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not <em>stalking</em> you,\u201d she huffs. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure out where you go every night!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI go for a walk,\u201d Derek says, hoping that his heart beat doesn\u2019t skip. It\u2019s not <em>technically</em> a lie. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now stop following me!\u201d</p>\n<p>He moves to walk away but she skips forward to be next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyes are different,\u201d she says, staring up at him. He rolls them, angles for home so he can attempt to drop her off.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, they are,\u201d she replies. \u201cMore\u2026 bluish? Are you sick? Is that it? Are you hiding the fact that you are dying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not dying,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sick. And my eyes are the same gold as always.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey <em>aren\u2019t</em>,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean\u2026 mostly. But I think they are a little blue too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need a hobby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you taking something?\u201d she asks and then <em>grins</em>. \u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s how you\u2019re suddenly so good at fighting! Is it some kind of herb or-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Cora,</em> \u201d Derek snaps. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anything. That doesn\u2019t even make sense. Just <em>go away</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>It comes out testier than he means for it to and she blinks at him, hurt. At least, she lets it show for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine,</em> \u201d she snaps. \u201c <em>Be</em> too cool to hang out with the family anymore. <em>Whatever</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>She storms off and he opens his mouth to call after her, because she\u2019s right. He <em>should</em> want to spend time with his family, with his pack. Technically, he doesn\u2019t need to go see Stiles <em>every</em> night. Stiles would probably be happy if he didn\u2019t come so often, but he- He <em>wants</em> to see Stiles. Wants to so badly that it\u2019s almost a physical itch.</p>\n<p>So he doesn\u2019t call after her.</p>\n<p>He does another loop through the woods and then heads to Stiles.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re early!\u201d Stiles says as Derek drops in the gully midafternoon.</p>\n<p>Stiles clears his throat. He had sounded more honestly surprised than sarcastic.</p>\n<p>They may have even been a touch of happiness.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been over two weeks now and it\u2019s not that Stiles has <em>forgotten</em> that Derek is biding his time until he can rip the magic from Stiles\u2019 body and use it to make himself even stronger and faster but, well, sometimes it\u2019s easier not to think about it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to just see Derek as the person who delivers him food and will fill up his water canteen without being told and who will come talk to him for at least a little while.</p>\n<p>So he doesn\u2019t <em>like</em> it, he doesn\u2019t- but\u2026 well, he\u2019s bored. He\u2019s stuck in a canyon, side now almost completely healed, with absolutely nothing to do. He\u2019d spent a few days trying to find a branch that he could fashion into a crutch but then Derek had seen and brought back a polished, clean pole from his village. So Stiles\u2019 big project that was supposed to keep him entertained for days was over in a few short hours.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, swinging into the wooded area where Stiles has set up his rudimentary camp. As is more usual than not nowadays, the bag of food he brought is practically overflowing.</p>\n<p>Stiles almost feels bad that he\u2019s started to squirrel away some of the jerky for his return trip. Well, he does until he remembers that Derek is just waiting around for his magic to grow back and then most likely kill him. Then he feels less bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cRose, one of Satomi\u2019s betas, is giving birth today,\u201d Derek explains. \u201cNo afternoon training.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to say something, when suddenly there\u2019s a sound from somewhere above them. Stiles doesn\u2019t really think about it, has already classified it as some sort of animal, but Derek stiffens, drops the bag of food and then <em>moves.</em></p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t even have time to protest as suddenly Derek is yanking him down and into the thickest area of trees, one hand clamped over Stiles\u2019 mouth to ensure he doesn\u2019t make a sound.</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to bite Derek\u2019s hand anyway when he notices that Derek\u2019s eyes are pointed upwards and he\u2019s <em>shifted</em>. As if in danger. Stiles stops struggling. Derek presses his other finger to his own lips, signaling for quiet, and then when Stiles nods, he slides his hand from Stiles\u2019 mouth to his neck.</p>\n<p>Stiles freezes for an entirely different reason.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s claws are now almost aligned with the four scars that already mar the back of his neck. A little bit over and Stiles know they will sink in easily and there will be a stab of pain through his spine and then the world will go black and there will be a <em>suction</em> as if all the blood in his body is being pulled away from him, away from where it needs to be and then-</p>\n<p>Then just more pain. For five minutes, sometimes ten if they\u2019ve let him go for a while and, if they decide to mess with his memory, he\u2019ll get flashes. Little bit of the things they are taking from him, the emotions associated with each that he\u2019ll never quite feel again.</p>\n<p>Then it will be over. The claws will pull out and Stiles will go cold and lean over to throw up in the bucket they provide for just this reason. They\u2019ll give him a heartbeat, maybe two, to gasp and shudder, to work his throat open again, to spit into the bucket, and then they\u2019ll shove him off the table and he\u2019ll scramble to get his feet under him and leave the room.</p>\n<p>Scott will be waiting for him outside, ready to catch him and throw a spare jacket over his shoulders, wiping away the blood from his neck as he does so and-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d Derek\u2019s hand tightens around his neck. They\u2019ve shifted back into his human form and the barest edge of his fourth finger is brushing against one of the scars.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t move or they\u2019ll take something.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Don\u2019t move or they\u2019ll take the rest of her.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is-?\u201d Derek cranes his neck around to look and his eyes widen in surprise as he sees them and-</p>\n<p>Stiles shoves him away, using just a bit of magic to make sure that Derek flies a full four steps away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he orders, wishing his heart wasn\u2019t pounding in his ears. He rises to his feet, grabbing for his crutch with one hand and his knife with the other. Spots fill his vision and he struggles to blink them away. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d Derek asks, holding his hands in the air. He looks like he is worried Stiles has gone crazy. \u201cStiles, I just pulled you down because I\u2019m pretty sure Cora is following me here. I wasn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just like that, Stiles is sick of this game. Of Derek pretending that he isn\u2019t waiting for Stiles\u2019 to recover completely so he can drain him. Of Derek acting like he doesn\u2019t even <em>know</em> what Stiles is talking about.</p>\n<p>It had been fine before, when he was too weak to stand and Derek brought him extra blankets and food and started a small fire him at night but now\u2026</p>\n<p>It had been almost two weeks. Stiles is still trapped in this canyon because his leg still can\u2019t hold him but he is handling everything else. Maybe not food, but he can get his own water and start a fire and is slowly but surely setting up a small form of shelter for when it rains.</p>\n<p>He is also starting to map out the easiest rock face to climb out of here, but Derek doesn\u2019t need to know about that.</p>\n<p>What Derek <em>must</em> already know, must already sense because werewolves know these things, is that Stiles\u2019 magic is back. Maybe not all the way, but it\u2019s been a long time before Stiles has been allowed to fill up completely. He\u2019s not even sure how much more he <em>could</em> get. Even with the level he\u2019s at right now, he feels\u2026 wired. Like he should be using it somehow. He could blast Derek further back if he wanted or fire a <em>real</em> ball of fire this time or-</p>\n<p>Or nothing.</p>\n<p>Despite all his power, he can\u2019t make his leg heal any faster. He can propel Derek away, but he can\u2019t propel himself <em>up</em> and even if he could, his leg won\u2019t last for the journey back home. Chances are he\u2019d end up caught by other werewolves. Werewolves who won\u2019t be so interested in keeping him alive or semi-healthy for long enough that he could escape.</p>\n<p>He has to get back to Scott. Right now, keeping Derek happy is his best option of doing that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, shoving the knife back into his pocket. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s fine. Sorry. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Derek doesn\u2019t move, he hobbles closer. He\u2019s done this almost every other week for six years. As long as Derek doesn\u2019t take too much, he\u2019ll recover in a few hours. And it\u2019s not like he has anything better to do than rest.</p>\n<p>He hops the last few steps and then turns. He and Derek are almost of equal height so he bends his head. He\u2019ll collapse once Derek starts but Derek will have to catch him if he wants his fingers to stay rammed into his neck and Stiles may want this over with, but he\u2019s not <em>lying down</em> in front of a werewolf. Not unless he\u2019s forced to.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t- don\u2019t take too much, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not exactly sure how werewolves know to stop but even Kali has managed not to kill anyone. He\u2019s hoping it has to be a concerted effort.</p>\n<p>He squeezes his eyes shut. His vision is always the first thing to go and last thing to come back so it\u2019s easier that way.</p>\n<p>Scott won\u2019t be here to catch him or lead him back to their hut or wipe the blood from his neck, but that\u2019s okay.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to get this over with.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are,\u201d Derek starts and then stops, one hand coming up to brush over the scars. \u201cStiles, what are these? What are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- have you never done it yourself before?\u201d Stiles asks. His scent spikes into something almost like panic before it suddenly goes muted again. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve watched, right? I think it\u2019s\u2026 I mean I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s instinctual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty sure <em>what\u2019s</em> instinctual?\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t feel any instincts about what to do with Stiles. Except the ones telling him to take care of Stiles, to come visit him at least once a day, to protect him from enemies- even if those enemies are Derek\u2019s own Pack.</p>\n<p>Underneath him, Stiles goes still. Derek lets go of the Fury\u2019s neck completely but it\u2019s still another heartbeat before Stiles finally turns around.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he says slowly and his hand drifts toward his knife again, but Derek thinks that\u2019s more instinct than anything. \u201cWhat do you think an emissary \u2013 a Fury \u2013 what do you think I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA magic user,\u201d Derek replies. Satomi had touched upon Furies. Though she\u2019d only told them enough to impress upon them the danger of Furies, to explain that if they see one, their duty is to warn everyone in the area and then leave them for the more experienced fighters. \u201cA human with the ability to use magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut what else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth twists.</p>\n<p>\u201cKillers,\u201d he says. \u201cFuries are the most dangerous and ruthless of the humans and specialize in killing.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>With fire mostly,</em> he adds mentally. <em>Because burns are the hardest to heal and fire consumes quickly and maybe you can run in and save two of your younger children, but if you go in for a third time--</em></p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t need Satomi to teach him that.</p>\n<p>He pulls his thoughts away from that and then shakes his head to wipe the emotion from his face. He can\u2019t think about that now. Not with Stiles looking at him, heart still racing too fast to be natural.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pack works to take them down first,\u201d he admits. \u201cThough we\u2019ve only ever succeeded in injuring them enough that they have to retreat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t keep any yourself?\u201d Stiles presses.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, frowning. \u201cWhy would we? Some werewolves believe they\u2019re rabid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a step away from him, as if just now realizing how close they are. He smells\u2026 scared? It not quite panic anymore- there\u2019s too much disbelief for that - but\u2026 it\u2019s not calm, not by a long shot. Derek barely resists the urge to rub at his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t use them? You don\u2019t drain them until they\u2019re dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrain them? What are you- we\u2019ve never even managed to <em>capture</em> one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut they\u2026 some have disappeared,\u201d Stiles says, more to himself than Derek. \u201cNot come back from raids at all and if you\u2019re not\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He fades into silence for a beat, staring into the distance and then barks a laugh that may be the darkest sound Derek has ever heard. It sounds almost painful.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, still grinning, all teeth, the grin that Derek has learned to hate. Or maybe he always did. \u201cAt least we let you live\u2026 what a bunch of-\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts himself off as if stabbed and Derek watches as the Fury\u2019s eyes slam back to him. They are a few shades too dark, lacking all their usual humor.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey why didn\u2019t you kill me?\u201d he asks. It\u2019s Derek\u2019s turn to wince and glance away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know about the magic or what emissaries are really good for, then why\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Derek grumbles. It all makes no sense. Stiles never makes sense. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t kill you because I\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>There. That\u2019s simple enough. He had looked at Stiles, hurt and bleeding and practically dead already and he hadn\u2019t wanted to kill him.</p>\n<p>Though, it was more than that.</p>\n<p>Because he never wanted to kill anyone, but he <em>couldn\u2019t</em> kill Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Stiles is frowning at him, face a picture of confusion. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain <em>anything.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. Maybe it doesn\u2019t. But there\u2019s no other way to explain it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just\u2026 you\u2019re just going to let me go,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t- I\u2019m not your prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cYou can leave whenever you\u2019re healed. Or whenever- whenever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not that Stiles would want to stay any longer than necessary. Not that Derek wanted him to. This was just- he was-</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you even talking about?\u201d He says, pulling his thoughts away from that direction. Of course he wanted Stiles to leave. The kid was sarcastic, annoying, rude, and dangerous. The entire point of taking his pain and feeding him was to get him on his way back to his own village. Away from Derek. \u201cAbout the magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks at him for a long time, head tilted and eyes focused. Derek thinks for a moment he\u2019s actually going to open up.</p>\n<p>Then he smirks, and Derek knows the answer before he even says it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I\u2019m telling you,\u201d he says, eyebrows lifted in a challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>It probably should annoy Derek, that Stiles still doesn\u2019t trust him, but it doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>For some reason, it just makes him smile back.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek stays for longer than Stiles realizes, stays until the conversation has shifted away from sensitive topics back to general opinions and lighthearted stories, stays until Stiles finally allows himself to put down his knife and stops flinching whenever Derek moves too close.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark when Derek finally leaves, dark enough that Derek casually shifts his eyes over to see better, and they seem to glow almost blue in the light of the moon. Stiles thinks that they are brighter than any other werewolf\u2019s and he stares for a moment, just a second, and then Derek is nodding and leaping away.</p>\n<p>And for some reason, it\u2019s then that the enormity of what just happened finally hits Stiles.</p>\n<p>He almost drives himself into a panic attack replaying the conversation, certain that, despite it all, the soft laughter and the gentle slow movements, Derek <em>must</em> be lying. He <em>must</em> be but Stiles can\u2019t quite think of any good reason why he would be. There\u2019s no angle there. Except maybe to be cruel, to let Stiles\u2019 guard fall even more than it already has and he just doesn\u2019t\u2026 he doesn\u2019t think that Derek would do that.</p>\n<p>He might even trust Derek a little bit and that thought <em>does</em> send him into a panic attack, albeit a small one because that\u2019s not\u2026 that\u2019s <em>wrong</em>. Werewolves are cruel and evil and how can he trust Derek when he might have to kill him and-</p>\n<p>He calms down eventually. It takes longer than it should without Scott there to talk him through it.</p>\n<p>The thought makes him even more miserable. Because Scott could be dead. Maybe not on this raid (Derek had said that they didn\u2019t kill anyone) but there were four other packs in surrounding areas that they were sometimes ordered to attack and-</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s fine, </em>Stiles tries to assure himself. <em>Not killed. Not captured.</em></p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that this pack is the only one that takes prisoners and Derek had also said that they had only captured three older people. Stiles doesn\u2019t hate the older members of Beacon Hills, the rough men and women who have long been beaten into submission, who fight over their kills and refuse to share the spoils \u2013 can\u2019t hate them because he <em>understands</em> them but he can\u2019t care about them either. He doesn\u2019t have the time.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s <em>Scott</em> who keeps him from being just like them, who feeds their parents first but then whoever else needs it and who keep encouraging Stiles to try to learn how to heal with his extra magic, rather than fight or boost Scott and-</p>\n<p>If Scott\u2019s gone, Stiles will-</p>\n<p>\n<em>He\u2019s fine. He has to be.</em>\n</p>\n<p>His anxiety has left him exhausted but he is still too wired to sleep. He feels that same itch under his skin that has been building for over a week now. Ever since-</p>\n<p><em>Ever since he got his magic back</em>.</p>\n<p>He could use it, he realizes almost abruptly. There\u2019s no need to hide it from Derek or worry that the Alphas will notice it\u2019s lower than usual.</p>\n<p>For the first time in his life, he\u2019s free to use it however he wants. Whenever he wants.</p>\n<p>He could- Well, he doesn\u2019t really know what he could do. He doesn\u2019t have any Mountain Ash and, besides, setting up a ring is one of the things Stiles never even had to think about it, it\u2019s too dark to attempt flinging his knife around, and Scott isn\u2019t here for Stiles to use his self-invented boosting spells on.</p>\n<p>Well, fire it is then.</p>\n<p>Fire is the one thing that the Alphas bother \u201cteaching\u201d the emissaries to do. And it\u2019s not really teaching so much as snarling threats and laughing as any emissaries that haven\u2019t just been drained attempt to whisper advice without drawing attention to themselves.</p>\n<p>Stiles picked it up easily. He\u2019d only burned himself twice before learning how to project it away from his hands and he\u2019d never had a problem making it as big as Deucalion demanded.</p>\n<p>It is just a matter of drawing focus <em>inward</em> and turning that pull into something like anger (never hard to do, only hard to control) and then-</p>\n<p>He lets it build in his hand for a while, watches as this tips of his fingers tips turn their usual shade of \u2013 well, actually they look a bit blueish rather than orange, but blue fire is hotter so that\u2019s probably because he\u2019s so <em>full</em> right now \u2013 and then,</p>\n<p>\u00a0He aims the fireball towards the rock wall, careful not to shoot it up into the sky or let it get big enough to start a <em>real</em> fire but it\u2019s still impressive, remains blue as it streaks through the sky and then explodes to orange.</p>\n<p>The heat of it warms his face and he finds himself smiling.</p>\n<p>He should keep himself topped up for his journey back but that\u2019s still over a week away, which is plenty of time and-</p>\n<p>For once, he can start experimenting.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>End Chapter 2.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chapter 3</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the end, they make it almost a month, twenty-seven days to be exact before Derek makes a mistake.</p>\n<p>He is sitting with the fish line in the water, even though it\u2019s the middle of the night and the fish are doubtlessly asleep and Stiles is standing, cautiously bending his leg slowly, exercising it without putting any weight on it. And Derek doesn\u2019t mean to but it just\u2026 it just pops out.</p>\n<p>Stiles is talking, telling a story that involves a squirrel and his friend, Scott, and-</p>\n<p>\u201cBet I could have caught it,\u201d Derek says, smirking just because he can. Because it\u2019s been days now, over a week since Stiles learned Derek wasn\u2019t after his magic and they\u2019re finally at the point where Stiles sometimes smiles and teases back and-</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Stiles says, looking down to focus on pulling his foot up towards his chest. He only winces a little which Derek takes as a good sign. It\u2019s still crazy to him that humans take this long to heal but at least Stiles seems to be doing better. \u201cYou could not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuperior werewolf speed and strength,\u201d Derek points out. \u201cSquirrels are nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Stiles replies, glancing at him again. He looks almost relaxed as he rolls his eyes. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll prove it,\u201d Derek offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile in a canyon? I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve scared them all off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could catch you one and bring it back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike that counts,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou would definitely cheat. You probably domesticate squirrels or some shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs at that. The past ten days Stiles has kept up a constant stream of musing as to what Derek\u2019s pack is like. Derek knows it\u2019s not entirely benign, knows it\u2019s Stiles way of fishing for information, trying to nail down how exactly his pack and the Alliance operates but it can be entertaining.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. We don\u2019t train squirrels,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBut if you want to witness it, then I\u2019ll-\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops. Once Stiles can get out of this canyon, he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s gone and Derek won\u2019t have to sneak him food in the middle of the night or help him fill his canteen or debunk his increasingly wild theories about his pack. He\u2019ll just\u2026 disappear. Forever. As if he were never here.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could catch you one when you visit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tries to sound casual when he says it, tries to sound like Stiles does when he talks about being hungry or taking forever to heal or any of the other thousand things that seem <em>wrong</em> but slip out too easily.</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee! I knew you couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he says, still smiling. He doesn\u2019t seem to realize that Derek is serious.</p>\n<p>Stiles is leaving soon. They both know it even though they\u2019ve never mentioned it aloud. But Stiles\u2019 leg is almost completely healed, or at least, healed enough that he moves around constantly and only rubs at it absently towards the end of the night. The pain Derek takes almost every night has faded from a deep throb to a dull ache.</p>\n<p>Derek hasn\u2019t missed the multiple stashes of food Stiles has spread throughout the canyon either. The biggest is underneath his small shelter in the woods but he\u2019s started two more than Derek has sniffed out. He also hasn\u2019t missed the fact that the rocks on the far wall smell like Stiles, like he\u2019s already started to practice scaling up them.</p>\n<p>Derek wonders if, even now, it never occurs to Stiles that Derek would help him out of this canyon if he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Derek insists, trying to keep his voice light because that seems to be how Stiles communicates, through jokes and teasing and- \u201cJust come back and visit.\u201d</p>\n<p>He fails in trying to keep his voice casual. It comes out more desperate. More like a plea.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles says, softly. And Derek\u2019s stomach drops because for once, Stiles doesn\u2019t sound amused. He sounds\u2026 careful. Sad, almost. \u201cWe\u2019re not- I can\u2019t come visit you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Derek says, standing and trying to ignore the fact that all his heart has started hammering and there\u2019s an odd fear at the back of his throat. \u201cI mean, look, no one has found us out yet and it\u2019s been almost a month! We can just meet here sometimes. When- when you can sneak away or-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing that.\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice sounds flat and final and Derek hates it. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t want that, Derek. Not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Derek says and he knows he\u2019s not lying. He loves his family, he <em>does</em>, but Stiles is-</p>\n<p>Stiles challenges him and makes him laugh and Derek feels <em>better</em> when they can just sit and talk, even if they\u2019re arguing, even if Stiles is making fun of him, even if Stiles had spent the day working himself too hard, talking to himself, and his voice is slightly hoarse and he falls asleep while Derek is trying to tell a story.</p>\n<p>Derek likes Stiles. He\u2019s not even sure what that means yet or what is going to happen but- but letting Stiles walk out of his life forever is unacceptable.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, you can\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says, shifting too quickly onto his bad leg and flinching off. \u201cYou- don\u2019t- you don\u2019t know anything about me! I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Derek says. He knows everything he needs to about Stiles. Stiles eats too quickly, like he\u2019s afraid it\u2019s going to be taken away, but still doesn\u2019t eat much, saving most of it for later. He\u2019s named one of the bigger fishes who is too smart to bite any of his bait Leeds and Derek has heard Stiles engaged in entire conversations with it as he drops into the canyon. His smirks don\u2019t reach his eyes but his laughter shakes his whole body.</p>\n<p>Derek knows Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I\u2019m not,\u201d Stiles starts, waving a hand. \u201cI\u2019m not what you think I am. I\u2019m not-\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops completely and Derek doesn\u2019t say anything. Just lets the silence stretch because he doesn\u2019t even begin to know what questions to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve <em>killed</em> werewolves before, Derek,\u201d Stiles says suddenly. His voice is soft and quiet and Derek freezes, listening for the lie.</p>\n<p>It has to be a lie. Stiles doesn\u2019t have any bands. Derek checks again, only to see that for the first time in days, Stiles\u2019 fist is curled around his knife again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cNot directly, you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, directly,\u201d Stiles interrupts, choking on a merciless laugh. \u201cDirectly as in stabbed them with a wolfsbane blade to the heart and slit their throat directly.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s still no lie. There has to be-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any bands,\u201d Derek insists, waving a hand at Stiles\u2019 bare arm. \u201cEven Furies get them, we know-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve tried to tell you. You don\u2019t get fed unless you make kills,\u201d he says this like it means something. \u201cExcept for Emissaries. We\u2019re too valuable to let starve, but\u2026 Scott could never do it. We\u2019d fight together and he\u2019s better with the sword then I am and I can use my magic to make him faster while hanging back and he would always get them in a corner and then he-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows. Derek <em>knows</em> there is a look of horror on his face but he can\u2019t change it.</p>\n<p>The loss of a member of your pack was\u2026 was <em>unspeakable.</em> Derek had felt it too many times.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe always hesitates,\u201d one of Stiles\u2019 shoulders falls up and down in a movement that isn\u2019t quite a shrug. \u201cHe can\u2019t do it. So I- I do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up and meets Derek\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it. Twice,\u201d His glare turns defiant. \u201cAnd we take back their \u2013 the proof and Scott turns them in as his kills and gets the bands and enough food for him and his mom and I will have to do it again, Derek. That\u2019s how we do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles-\u201d Derek wants him to stop. To stop this.</p>\n<p>He wants it to be a lie.</p>\n<p>Stiles barrels on.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only reason we weren\u2019t together the night I attacked you is because Scott was drawn into another battle and people are going to start getting suspicious if we always go off together and he comes back with a kill. But winter is coming and our parents are both -- I left to find another.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have killed her, Derek. Your sister. Cora. If Scott were there, we probably could have taken at least one of you and I would have Ringed the other and I\u2019ll have to do it again at some point. And I won\u2019t hesitate. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds firm. Almost angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a killer, Derek. It\u2019s like you said. Furies kill people. It\u2019s what we\u2019re good for and it\u2019s how it\u2019s always going to be. And you saying differently isn\u2019t going to change anything. There\u2019s no such thing as an innocent human. Except maybe Scott and he- I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in his voice breaks and despite it all, Derek reaches for him.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a step away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Stiles stops and clears his throat. \u201cYou should go, Derek. I don\u2019t know what we think we\u2019re doing here but-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d he says, limping back another step. \u201cIt <em>won\u2019t</em> so just- just get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t move at first \u2013 isn\u2019t going to \u2013 and Stiles must sense it.</p>\n<p>Because the next moment, there is a pressure against Derek\u2019s shoulders and it\u2019s not a shove backwards but it is unrelenting. He falls back one step and then another when the magic still doesn\u2019t let up, not even when Stiles turns away from him</p>\n<p>Derek finally does then what he should have done the first time he saw Stiles.</p>\n<p>He leaps up the rocks and runs.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Stiles spends the next two days getting ready.</p>\n<p>He uncovers all his hidden stashes of food and packs them into one bag, he spends an afternoon trying to get his magic to mend the shirt that Derek gave him that is understandably ratty around the edges, he cuts down his crutch into a walking stick and continues to do exercises on his leg, staring up at the canyon wall and trying to visualize actually climbing up it and-</p>\n<p>And then he grits his teeth and sharpens his knife and cuts his hair as best he can. Because unlike most of the other humans, emissaries are required to keep their hair short. It helps with the stealth missions they are often sent on, and, more importantly, gives the wolves easier access to the back of their neck.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s probably why everyone else keeps their hair so long. No one wants to look like an emissary. Not for a moment. Stiles doesn\u2019t blame them. There\u2019s a reason he pushes the boundary and insists on shaving the sides of his head short and leaving the middle as long as they will allow him.</p>\n<p>He cuts himself twice, nicking the top of his ear bad enough that it bleeds and he wishes Scott was here to do it.</p>\n<p>His first shearing was at the hands of Ennis, but Scott has done every one since. He knows how to gently scrape along the sides so it is as short as it can be and he knows exactly how long Stiles can get away with for the middle, especially the back. So that the Alphas can get to his neck but it\u2019s still <em>different</em>, still defiant, at least a little bit. He doesn\u2019t know how but Scott always manages it and Stiles loves it.</p>\n<p>This time, he\u2019s careful to cut it shorter than Scott would. He\u2019s been gone for a month now and he\u2019s assuming that the amount of magic he\u2019s bringing back will be enough to placate them, or at least see the benefit of keeping him alive but he\u2026 He knows the other emissaries weren\u2019t killed by this pack at least. And that means the Alphas probably drained them to death.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very possible they\u2019ll do that to him the moment he steps foot in the village.</p>\n<p><em>They won\u2019t</em>, he tries to assure himself, clutching the knife in his fist a little harder, considering cutting it all off, getting rid of the one last bit of defiance he allows himself. <em>They\u2019re not going to kill me.</em></p>\n<p>He\u2019s too valuable. He\u2019s one of the youngest emissaries and judging by the amount of times that it is Deucalion to drain him instead of the others, he thinks he produces the most magic and they won\u2019t want to waste him. They might hurt him or separate him from the others for a while, but draining him completely would be stupid. And the Alphas aren\u2019t stupid.</p>\n<p>He drags in a ragged breath and leaves his hair the way it is.</p>\n<p>They won\u2019t kill him.</p>\n<p>Of course, they will do other things.</p>\n<p>He knows they are going to dig through his memory and find out what exactly he has been up to these past weeks. Hopefully the gap caused by his injury won\u2019t make him suspicious and hopefully they won\u2019t find anything damning as they poke around his innermost thoughts and feelings and hopefully they\u2019ll only remove the important bits, the bit where he realized that they were liars, that other packs didn\u2019t even know what an emissary <em>was</em>, let alone how to use one.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, they\u2019ll leave it at that but-</p>\n<p>They could take it all.</p>\n<p>They could take Derek\u2019s awkward attempts at asking to take away his pain and their stilted first conversations, the easy laughter that now flows between the two even though Stiles doesn\u2019t remember making the decision to get comfortable. They could take the way Derek\u2019s eyebrows draw together in concern when Stiles says something that he doesn\u2019t understand and the half-quirk to his mouth when Stiles says something he finds funny and the way his eyes linger \u2013 only sometimes- on the side of Stiles\u2019 neck that isn\u2019t marred by a tattoo.</p>\n<p>They probably will. It\u2019s too risky otherwise and so Stiles will be left with just a big hole where this past month has been and his father and Scott won\u2019t ever be able to fill him in on the details, won\u2019t be able to tell him what it is he is missing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll live his whole life wondering what happened in the month he was away, probably believe whatever stories they tell him, believe that the Hale Pack had tortured him and they had saved him and he should be <em>grateful</em>.</p>\n<p>His hands are shaking, he realizes abruptly, but it\u2019s not a panic attack. It\u2019s\u2026 slower somehow and deeper and maybe it\u2019s something like grief, even though that doesn\u2019t make any sense and he hasn\u2019t lost anything- not yet and-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles jumps, blinking back moisture that isn\u2019t supposed to be there and scrambles to his feet.</p>\n<p>And then clutches his knife even tighter because two days ago he had confessed to murder and <em>Derek Hale</em> is standing in front of him. Coming closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asks, eyes flicking upwards to the lip of the canyon. Derek must know that he can\u2019t take Stiles alone, not now that Stiles\u2019 leg is practically healed and his magic is replenished. But werewolves hunt in packs and any more than three or four and Stiles would be hard pressed to fight his way out. Even if he could kill a few-</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> to kill Derek. He-</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d he offers, swallowing. \u201cToday, actually, so just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said \u2018have to,\u2019\u201d Derek says suddenly and it confuses Stiles enough that he stops scanning the trees and looks back at Derek. It doesn\u2019t help. His face is unreadable.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore,\u201d Derek is still moving closer. \u201cWhen you said you said you would- when you said you will kill werewolves again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at him. Still not understanding. He <em>will</em> kill werewolves again. That\u2019s the point. He can\u2019t stop. Not when his father and Scott and Mrs. McCall are still trapped in Beacon Hills. And escape isn\u2019t an option. People aren\u2019t allowed to leave. Not even when they are old and useless and starving to death. The Alphas still make sure there is no leaving.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you would <em>have</em> to,\u201d Derek continues. \u201cNot that you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a step back as Derek gets within arm\u2019s reach, but that\u2019s when the werewolf finally stops moving. Stiles is just lucky he can hear him over his own heartbeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are other things too,\u201d Derek says and Stiles flinches back when Derek lifts his hand, but all he does is start counting on his fingers. \u201cThe tattoos that you hate, the scars on your neck, the talk of how food is distributed in your village\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said <em>have to</em>,\u201d Derek repeats and then he is sitting down on the log that has become their spot, staring up evenly at Stiles. \u201cI think it\u2019s time you told me why exactly it is that humans attack us every year. Why you <em>have</em> to kill us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head automatically. He can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s \u2013 they Alphas will <em>know</em> and they will kill him for it, because they might want his magic, but they will never forgive him for revealing them to the other Packs. Never. Derek already knows too much already.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason they send out all human strike teams until the very end, until the other Pack is weak and whittled away from years of raids, until they can go in and kill everyone. The element of surprise is crucial and if Stiles ruins that for them-</p>\n<p>They\u2019ll kill him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI -,\u201d he says. Derek still hasn\u2019t moved. Stiles isn\u2019t fooled for an instant. Derek could leap at him right now and end all of this. Still, he looks at the ground instead of at the werewolf. Mutters the phrase soft enough that Derek couldn\u2019t hear it if he wasn\u2019t a werewolf. \u201cWhat happens if I can\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tenses, ready for a threat, ready for Derek to tell him that either Stiles give him a good reason or he doesn\u2019t get to leave, ready to Ring Derek if he has to, and he clenches his jaw, just <em>ready</em> and turns his glare to Derek and-</p>\n<p>And sees that Derek\u2019s eyes have gone soft and sad and maybe <em>resigned</em>. Like he expected this.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you leave,\u201d Derek says calmly and Stiles feels it like a punch to the chest. \u201cYou go and I let you and that\u2019s all that happens, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles look down at his hands. They\u2019re shaking again.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Derek continues and Stiles almost feels relief that Derek is going to say something that makes <em>sense</em>, something like \u2018I\u2019ll kill you if I see you again\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t you dare come back here.\u2019 \u201cI won\u2019t be able to help you if I don\u2019t know. And I want- Stiles, I could help. I <em>promise</em> I could at least try and-\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stands as he speaks, takes another step closer and this is- Stiles-</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pack of werewolves,\u201d Stiles says, looking up from where his gaze has dropped to meet Derek\u2019s eyes. \u201cA pack of Alphas, actually. And they- they\u2019re the ones who control the humans. All of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek freezes and Stiles cringes, certain he is going to be accused of lying because Derek had spoken enough about the topic to know that even the Alliance of three packs living so close together was a rarity, that a pack of only Alphas should be <em>impossible</em> and-</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Derek says, sitting back down. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the crazy thing is that Stiles thinks he will.</p>\n<p>Thinks he wants to.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek tries very, very hard to keep his face neutral. Because he wants Stiles to feel like he can tell Derek anything, to not regret finally choosing to open up and Stiles has always seemed to be able to read him so Derek bites down on the inside of his cheek and clasps his hands together and tries to focus on <em>keeping still</em>.</p>\n<p>Because if he doesn\u2019t, he might lose it.</p>\n<p>If he allows the horror and disgust to show on his face, Stiles might get embarrassed or start censoring the story and if he inhales too deeply and gets a good whiff of Stiles\u2019 scent, which is by turns horrified and dulled somehow, he may not be able to stop from howling; and, above all, if he lets himself really <em>focus</em> on the things Stiles is telling him, he has no doubt he will shift and take off in the direction of Beacon Hills right this moment.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an equally likely chance, he will grab Stiles, bring the Fury\u2019s erratic pacing to a stop, and just <em>hold</em> him.</p>\n<p>And he can\u2019t do that.</p>\n<p>Because anyone can see that Stiles is trying to hold it together. His tone oscillates between flat and emotionless, listing the basics like they don\u2019t matter, or throwing the story out there like a taunt, lips curling around the syllables in dark amusement, accompanied by an eye roll or shrug as if that somehow proves he\u2019s unaffected.</p>\n<p>\n<em>There\u2019s only nine of them, but they control the food supply and by this point, all other packs attack humans on sight so there\u2019s nowhere for us to go. Even if we wanted to try.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>There\u2019s not really a shortage, but they only give food to those who are useful, mostly to those who make kills and so that\u2019s why I had to- that\u2019s why we attack so much.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>So werewolves can take emissaries\u2019 magic. It makes them stronger, faster. That\u2019s- that\u2019s what the scars are for. That\u2019s how they do it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Derek tries not to interrupt. Tries not to push as Stiles\u2019 obviously shies away from certain topics, but sometimes he can\u2019t help it and-</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says as he Stiles takes a breath. \u201cSorry, but why don\u2019t the Furies fight back?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Stiles freezes and then goes for a grin a beat too late.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWell, there\u2019s not that many of us and we\u2019re drained most of the time,\u201d he says, shrugging one shoulder. \u201cUnless they are sending me on a raid, the most I can usually manage is lighting a freaking candle.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh,\u201d Derek nods, feeling silly for asking such a stupid question. It\u2019s then that he notices Stiles isn\u2019t looking at him.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He\u2019s looking down at the ground, one hand hesitantly coming up and skimming down his hair so that he\u2019s almost- but not quite- touching the scars on the back of his neck.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThere\u2019s,\u201d Stiles starts and his voice is low and nervous. He still doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cThere\u2019s something else the Alphas can do too.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Stiles takes a breath and Derek watches as he glances up for only a moment before focusing on the ground again, fingers slowly tracing over the marks once more.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThey can mess with your memories a little bit,\u201d he admits. \u201cIf they- if you misbehave or struggle, they can take stuff from you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cStuff?\u201d Derek repeats, failing to keep the horror from his voice. Luckily Stiles seems to register the question and nothing else.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMemories,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cMoments or days or- or people.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Derek wants to ask but he doesn\u2019t dare. Instead, he simply lets the silence linger, lets Stiles gnaw on his bottom lip and stare at where his toe is digging into the ground for a little while, fingers still running over his scars and just when Derek is afraid it\u2019s gone on too long, when he tries to work up the courage to say </em>something<em>, Stiles snatches his hand away from his neck and pulls out a grin that\u2019s not quite stable.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cSo, anyway, the </em>Furies<em>,\u201d he stops to grin at Derek then, a nod at his shift in vocabulary. \u201cDon\u2019t exactly get to do much, really. Just get these badass tattoos and keep our hair short and-\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>It takes a little while before Derek can pay attention again, but Stiles quickly starts on his theories on which packs each of the Alphas had come from and this is </em>important<em> this is information he should tell his mother so-</em></p>\n<p>All told, it takes almost an hour for Stiles to finishing tell him about Beacon Hills.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, well, that\u2019s it,\u201d Stiles says finally. \u201cYou can tell your mom everything if you want, not that I think it will actually help anything but at least you know now. That\u2019s why the humans attack and why I have to go back and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek interrupts, standing. No, Stiles cannot go back there. No alone. Not ever. \u201cYou can\u2019t go back there Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Normally when he tells Stiles what to do, he earns a glare, but this time Stiles\u2019 mouth curls up into a smile smaller than his usual grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd I will. Derek, I have <em>family </em>there. My dad is probably worried sick and Scott wouldn\u2019t have managed to kill any werewolves while I\u2019m gone and without me, they get a third less food so they might be <em>starving</em> and I- Staying isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I mean, you can\u2019t go back there <em>alone</em>. We have to stop them,\u201d Derek clarifies. \u201cThe Alphas. We have to tell my Mom and Satomi and Olin and you said it that there\u2019s only nine Alphas. We\u2019re three <em>packs.</em> We could- we can stop them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is staring at him. \u201cDerek, you can\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe <em>can</em>,\u201d Derek says, cutting him off and taking a step closer before stopping himself. \u201cYou said it yourself- the Alpha pack wants to destroy us completely and this is a way to make the attacks <em>stop</em>, once and for all. It\u2019s all my mom has wanted for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, she\u2026 she\u2019s not gonna believe you,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThis is- I <em>know</em> it sounds crazy. She\u2019s going to think I tricked you or that you made it up or-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to come with me to tell her,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cThey\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat they\u2019ll do is <em>kill</em> me,\u201d Stiles interrupts, running one hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m a <em>Fury</em>. You take me within two feet of you village and your pack will have me torn in half before I get a word in!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. Technically, that\u2019s true. There\u2019s no reason to spare a Fury, to even consider talking to one, and even if Derek escorted him, odds are he would get shoved aside and Stiles would be killed before he knew it.</p>\n<p>And letting a Fury in front of all three Alphas at once? It\u2019s too big a liability. It will never happen. Unless-</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Festival,\u201d he says. Stiles looks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Festival we have,\u201d Derek explains. \u201cEvery year, all three packs <em>and</em> Alphas attend and everyone will be too busy and excited to notice when I sneak you in. And I\u2019m in training so I\u2019m allowed near the ring in case whoever is fighting goes down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA ring like a <em>training</em> ring?\u201d Stiles asks but he doesn\u2019t sound nearly so against it as he had a moment before. \u201cA training ring surrounded by warrior werewolves who will want to kill me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a disguise,\u201d Derek promises. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people are going to <em>suspect</em> that a Fury is going to show up in the middle of the day. Everyone will be too busy having a good time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d Stiles says but that\u2019s not a no. Derek has known Stiles for a month now. He knows what that means.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to try,\u201d Derek tries. \u201cIf we can get my mom and the other Alphas to believe then\u2026 then we could stop them. The Alphas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would they even care?\u201d Stiles asks, some of the excitement dimming from his eyes. \u201cHumans have been attacking you guys for <em>years</em> and now that you know what to watch for, you could probably set up your defenses just fine. There\u2019s no point in risking yourselves to help us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a point,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s the right thing to do. Because a pack of Alphas is\u2026 it\u2019s <em>wrong</em>, Stiles. It\u2019s wrong that humans are forced to fight and that your magic gets taken away from you and that they take-\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops when Stiles looks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re gonna help,\u201d Derek repeats. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t that be better than just returning? We could get them all out \u2013 your dad and Scott and his mom. All of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- you really think they would listen?\u201d Stiles asks, but he\u2019s in. Derek can already tell.</p>\n<p>Derek nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s in three days,\u201d he says, somehow knowing that that will be Stiles\u2019 next question, knowing he won\u2019t want to wait for longer than he has to.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 face slides into something softer, almost hopeful, then-</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna die, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he says, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, smiling back. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. Promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>He keeps his voice light but if Stiles were a werewolf, he would hear that Derek\u2019s heart is perfectly steady.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek rushes to the canyon on the morning of the festival, fighting back the urge to throw up.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s going to be okay,</em> he assures himself for the thousandth time. <em>This works out for the better, it gives us a good excuse-</em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a split second when he lands that he doesn\u2019t see Stiles sitting near the spring in his now-usual spot and he panics but then Stiles is striding up to him, limping slightly since it\u2019s morning and Derek\u2019s suspects his leg takes a while to warm up, and-</p>\n<p>Derek can\u2019t help it. Despite all the bad news he\u2019s about to deliver, he laughs.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks ridiculous. Derek had brought him a pair of pants and a tunic two days ago, since nothing about Stiles\u2019 all-black Fury uniform was at all discreet and the shirt he had been wearing (that he\u2019d stolen from Laura actually) smelled too much like him. It had seemed like a good idea, since this way he would smell mostly of Derek and the plan was to stay together. And Stiles had looked a little doubtful when Derek had given them to him but, well-</p>\n<p>Now Derek can see why. The pants aren\u2019t too bad since they are practically the same height and it\u2019s probably a good thing that they are a bit too long and hide Stiles\u2019 black boots almost entirely. But the tunic\u2026 Well, it\u2019s obvious that Derek is a good deal broader than Stiles. Stiles is practically swimming in it.</p>\n<p>The coat doesn\u2019t help either, although at least it covers up the back of Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, real funny,\u201d Stiles mutters darkly as Derek keeps grinning. \u201cLaugh it on up there, Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek continues to do so because Stiles is pouting, but not truly angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look that bad,\u201d he tries as Stiles scowls at him, shoving up his sleeves before remembering that he can\u2019t do that without revealing his tattoos.</p>\n<p>\u201cI look like an idiot,\u201d Stiles tells him. \u201cPromise me if I die, you won\u2019t burn my body wearing this. I don\u2019t want to look stupid when I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just the thought cuts of Derek\u2019s amusement immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die,\u201d he repeats (for the hundredth time in three days). \u201cThough, I do have bad news.\u201d</p>\n<p>He winces as Stiles stills, staring at him in concern. Winces and looks down and-</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Stiles asks finally. \u201cHow could things possibly get any worse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-\u201d Derek starts. \u201cRemember how I\u2019ve said that one trainee is selected every year? To fight the strongest human we have in the ring?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles replies, still frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s me,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cI\u2019ve been selected.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was all his stupid human-tricks that he learned from Stiles. The sensitivity his nose had for the scent of human and the fact that he picked up some tracking tricks from there rare times Stiles told stories and, of course, the pain leeching trick, which meant that he was pretty sure some of the humans attacked him first and practically allowed themselves to be grabbed and taken out immediately.</p>\n<p>Stiles goes very still.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, running a hand through his hair, sweeping it back and forth along the short side as if that will help him think. \u201cOkay, well, what does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cI just found out like an hour ago! I mean, I have to be at the ring earlier and more people will want to know where I am and- I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, look,\u201d Stiles starts, gnawing on his bottom lip, still dragging his hand back and forth along his head. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s fine. Maybe it\u2019s even better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow. He\u2019s been telling himself that lie all morning but he\u2019s not sure how it could actually be better.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re expected to be at the ring,\u201d Stiles clarifies, flailing his hands through the air. \u201cNo one will question you being back there and I can just hide or something and then when it\u2019s your turn to go out, I\u2019ll just\u2026 tag along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we were going to try to let you talk to the Alphas in private,\u201d Derek says, frowning. \u201cOr at least more private than in the center of, well, everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t let you kill a human,\u201d Stiles grumbles. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no way to do it before the fight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen that\u2019s how we do it,\u201d Stiles says, he doesn\u2019t look as concerned as Derek feels. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing any other options.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Derek admits, sighing. \u201cYou\u2019re right just- you have to be <em>careful</em>. Stay where I put you and let me talk a little bit before you come out. I don\u2019t want this to be\u2026 abrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p>More like he doesn\u2019t want everyone panicking and killing Stiles before he gets a chance to speak but they both know that without having to say it aloud.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI stay hidden away until you prep \u2018em. Then come forward, hands up, careful not to make any sudden movements. Or fireballs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles appears relaxed about the whole thing, but Derek suddenly feels like this is moving too fast. Three days ago, this had seemed like a good idea, a viable alternative to Stiles just <em>leaving</em> but now that it was actually happening\u2026</p>\n<p>Now it just seems too risky. All three Alphas have lost pack members to the humans over decades of fighting and his own mother had lost her <em>mate</em> and maybe Stiles had been right the first time this came up, maybe none of them will actually be willing to listen to a young Beta werewolf and the Fury he was supposed to kill.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles says, taking a step closer and ducking his head to catch Derek\u2019s eyes. \u201cLook, either it works or it doesn\u2019t and either way, at least it will be over with. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods but something in his gut twists. He wonders how much of Stiles\u2019 life has revolved around that saying <em>At least it will be over with</em>. He wonders if Stiles\u2019 version of \u201cfine\u201d bothers to take his own life into account.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust, uh,\u201d Stiles suddenly says, encouraging smile sliding from his face. \u201cJust promise me one thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek freezes. A part of him knows what Stiles is going to say before the Fury even says it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t make it,\u201d Stiles continues, running a hand through his hair. \u201cJust promise you find a way to let my family know. Grab a human during the next attack and whisper it in their ear or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t use a note. Most of us can\u2019t read.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hold Derek\u2019s eyes for another moment before he is rolling his shoulders as if shaking something off.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, striding forward and clapping Derek on the shoulder as he brushes past. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Derek says, inhaling. \u201cWait, Stiles, you smell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean I smell?\u201d Stiles say, huffing. \u201cI took a dip in the spring like yesterday!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean you smell like a human,\u201d Derek clarifies, mouth quirking upwards. \u201cAlmost all the adults are literally trained to sniff out humans. And then kill them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts but his hands drift toward his pocket. \u201cI mean, I think I used up all my herbs that are supposed to counteract that,\u201d he admits. \u201cI don\u2019t know-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s- well, there\u2019s another way,\u201d Derek say, feeling his face warm a little bit. \u201cWe could get you to smell more like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles raises an eyebrow at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like that!\u201d Derek says. \u201cI just need to\u2026 hold you for a while. Maybe, uh, maybe rub at your neck a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is right in that it\u2019s not the most effective way to scent someone, but it will do for a day. If Stiles agrees to it. Because Stiles has grown comfortable enough to touch Derek sometimes, favoring him with a pat on the arm or a lazy swipe to the back of his head when Derek teases him, but he remains fairly sensitive to his own personal space. He sometimes lets his foot stretch out close to Derek when they sit around the fire but just as suddenly he\u2019ll leap up and away, moving restlessly as they talk. Derek nudges Stiles with his shoulders every once and a while but never more and-</p>\n<p>And he can\u2019t forget the last time he touched Stiles\u2019 neck, the gasping panic and the scent of dread and-</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well that\u2019s not bad,\u201d Stiles says, stepping forward. \u201cAlways knew you were looking for an excuse to hug me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes but takes a step closer as well, inhaling to try to make sure that Stiles is as okay with this as he sounds. There isn\u2019t anything immediately concerning so he takes a breath and wraps his arms around the Fury. He\u2019ll keep this quick and easy- just long enough to get Stiles smelling mostly of him and then-</p>\n<p>And then he makes the mistake of dropping his head toward Stiles\u2019 neck and inhaling again.</p>\n<p>The scent hits him like a wave- pine, mostly, with hints of fresh water and fish \u2013 but underneath all that is just\u2026 <em>Stiles.</em> It\u2019s spicy somehow and musky and there\u2019s a bit of smoke to it, which Derek has only ever associated with horrible things, but somehow mixed with Stiles\u2019 other scents it\u2019s softer, less acidic and Derek wants to taste-</p>\n<p>He leans back, trying to get some distance but all that does is make it so his eyes fall on Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s on the tattooed side, and he dimly remembers hating the wolf that stands out black and violent against Stiles\u2019 throat and, logically, he knows he hates it even more know that he knows how and why it was put there, but right now-</p>\n<p>Right now he\u2019s captivated by it. He can\u2019t help but follow the lines with his eyes, imagining the rest of the body of the wolf spread across Stiles\u2019 collarbone, the back two legs etched across his shoulder before the tail splinters all the way down his arm to his hands.</p>\n<p>When Stiles releases the breath he\u2019s holding, soft and silent across Derek\u2019s shoulder, and then swallows, the wolf shudders with the movement.</p>\n<p>Without thinking about it, Derek reaches his hand up to feel it, pressing his palm to the mark and maybe trying to leach away pain that is no longer there. He tightens his grip slightly, fingers just on the edge of the four tight patches of skin on the back of Stiles\u2019 neck and-</p>\n<p>He feels Stiles tense against him and he\u2019s already pulling away but then the next moment, Stiles relaxes.</p>\n<p>And then, though Derek doesn\u2019t put any pressure, Stiles head falls to the side, exposing more of his neck.</p>\n<p>Derek can\u2019t tell whose heart is beating louder- his or Stiles\u2019.</p>\n<p>His thumb is in the crook where Stiles\u2019 neck meets his jaw and instinctively, he lets it sweep out, down along Stiles\u2019 jaw and Stiles inhales again and that\u2019s when Derek finally leans back enough that he can pull his eyes away from Stiles\u2019 neck and onto his face.</p>\n<p>Stiles is beautiful. Derek almost never gets to see him in the sunlight, see how the morning light makes his eyes appear gold, almost like a wolf\u2019s, and they are huge in his face, dancing with something different than his usual dark amusement.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re standing too close, Derek realizes. This has gone on too long. He\u2019s still holding Stiles\u2019 neck and they\u2019re breathing the same air, Stiles only pausing to lick his lips and Derek can\u2019t help but track the movement and there\u2019s another swallow against his hand, smaller this time, nervous, and Stiles\u2019 hand is on Derek\u2019s elbow, which is something that Derek hadn\u2019t noticed before and they might be getting closer even though Derek is positive he\u2019s not moving and-</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks and jerks back.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh-kay, then,\u201d he says and Derek feels all the blood in his body rush to his head. What was he doing? That was- he finally glances up and feels slightly better when he sees that Stiles has turned bright red as well. \u201cWell. That was- effective scent marking? Yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mutely, Derek nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept, well, uh, let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s even, right?\u201d Stiles says and then he stumbles forward to grab Derek\u2019s other hand and wipe it against the other side of his neck. \u201cThere we go. All done. Smell is everywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Derek replies, telling himself he doesn\u2019t sound hoarse. That was \u2013 he can\u2019t \u2013 they can\u2019t deal with this right now. They have to get going.</p>\n<p>Still, he stays where he is as Stiles heads off to the canyon cliff side.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d Stiles calls. \u201cCome help me out of here so we can go save the day!\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Derek laugh for some reason and he goes.</p>\n<p>He can worry about whatever that was later.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know what he did to make Derek believe he is a reckless individual, but he clearly did something. Because Derek has not stopped freaking out since jumping out of the canyon and then turning around and helping haul Stiles up after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Derek says, pressing one hand to Stiles\u2019 chest to push him back as someone walks by. Stiles rolls his eyes but goes still. The passing werewolf is <em>literally</em> carrying a stack of boxes. He can\u2019t even <em>see</em> them.</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to huff or sigh or maybe even snicker and poke Derek in the side but he doesn\u2019t. He is positive that if he so much as thinks about talking, Derek will panic and press a hand to his mouth to stop him and Stiles-</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t think about what happened when Derek was scent-marking him. Because, they are in the middle of a highly complicated and likely-deadly mission at the moment and Derek is a werewolf and Stiles is unsure when he started trusting Derek and even more unsure as to when he started\u2026 <em>liking</em> Derek but, regardless, now is not the time.</p>\n<p>The werewolf passes without incident and Derek still remains frozen for two long beats before continuing. And that\u2019s better because when Stiles is pressed to Derek\u2019s side, he can\u2019t focus.</p>\n<p>And he needs to focus. He has to try to figure out what makes these werewolves different, and if it\u2019s possible that Derek is just too young to know that they <em>do </em>have emissaries, if it\u2019s just some well-guarded secret, and, above all, memorize an escape route out of here. Because the more he thinks about this, the more sure he is that this is a terrible plan.</p>\n<p>Maybe not as bad as going back and definitely having all his memories erased and possibly having his life-force sucked out of him, but still not great.</p>\n<p>It takes them a long time to make it to the training ring. Considering Derek stops them about every five steps, Stiles is surprised they make it there at all.</p>\n<p>Once he sees it though, he thinks that maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been in such a hurry.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting but it was not this huge, well-maintained structure. It is lined with wooden spikes and they\u2019ve installed raised stands for the crowd to sit on and-</p>\n<p>\u201cWe take training seriously,\u201d Derek mutters as if catching Stiles\u2019 scent of part-wonder, part-horror. \u201cWe- we have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, Stiles nods. The humans don\u2019t have the wood to spare for such a structure, not when there\u2019s are more important things to do like desperately cut firewood or scrounge for food, but if they had the spare time, Stiles is sure the humans would do the same thing.</p>\n<p>As it is, they take training just as seriously. From the time children can walk, they are given wooden swords and maybe some like to claim it\u2019s play but adults go around correcting grips and stances and even the kids realize it\u2019s something more by the time they\u2019re seven or eight.</p>\n<p>He shakes his head to clear his thoughts but it only gets worse when he follows Derek beneath the outer ring to the inside of the ring. Derek had mentioned that they keep some humans for training and so Stiles should have put together that they would obviously need somewhere to <em>stay</em> but-</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s not actually prepared to see the small caged areas that line the ring, protected from the weather but only barely. He can\u2019t help but imagine that if his dad were captured instead of just injured, he could be wasting away, practically starving. And it\u2019s not the werewolves\u2019 fault, obviously, but still, Stiles can\u2019t-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek hisses, drawing his attention away from one such enclosure. Stiles blinks and refocuses. There is no one even <em>in</em> the cell.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says, opening a door. \u201cThis is where we keep supplies for the humans, so it smells more like them anyway. And no one should come in till after the festival is over so-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI stay here till your big moment,\u201d Stiles finishes, waving a hand. \u201cNow, go before someone comes looking for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says, stepping towards the door without looking away. \u201cDon\u2019t move though. And don\u2019t touch anything. And if-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, go,\u201d Stiles says. Honestly, he\u2019s nervous but\u2026 he is also so <em>full</em> right now. His magic is restless almost, crackling under the surface of his skin, and he doesn\u2019t <em>want </em>it to happen, but if he needed to fight werewolves right now, he thinks he could win. Busted leg and everything. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t move?\u201d Derek asks again. Stiles is grinning fondly for some reason, although he doesn\u2019t remember telling himself to.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot until you come get me,\u201d he promises. Derek is still frowning, opens his mouth (doubtless to worry more) and so Stiles uses his magic to push him back, just a little, his hands flashing blue for an instant. Derek growls but it is entirely fond and then he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>The next forty minutes are not fun. Stiles has never done well with being trapped somewhere in the first place and the combination of nerves and magic that seems to be <em>singing</em> somehow doesn\u2019t help. He tries to stay still, then rocks up and down on his toes until his leg begins to ache, and then paces anyway.</p>\n<p>He tries not to, but his thoughts turn over all the ways that this can go wrong. It doesn\u2019t help his anxiety or his restlessness and there\u2019s a dozen times when he goes for the door to just take off and take his chances with the Alphas.</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Because he had promised Derek he\u2019d stay. And Stiles isn\u2019t usually one to make promises (let alone keep them) but\u2026</p>\n<p>If this works, it could change everything. His dad and Melissa could stop worrying about the coming winter and gain weight. Scott wouldn\u2019t have to fight; Stiles wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his breathing problems every time he fought. Stiles wouldn\u2019t have to frantically search his memories every time Alphas drained him and try to figure out if they had taken anything while he was still distracted by the rush of pain.</p>\n<p>This is worth the risk. He knows that.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still relieved when the door opens slowly and Derek is standing there, waving Stiles forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Derek whispers as Stiles steps forward. \u201cSatomi is already sitting with my mother and Olin. They\u2019re releasing the human now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles replies, mouth suddenly dry. \u201cOkay, so, do I stay here for a few minutes or--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHere, come with me. Quietly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glares \u2013 he knows that this is currently a time for silence! \u2013 but Derek is already turning.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Derek instructs, pushing him gently against the wall near the opening to the ring. \u201cNo one should be back here since all I have to do is walk out and, well-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFight a human to the death?\u201d Stiles says, drumming his fingers against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to explain the situation,\u201d Derek corrects. \u201cNo death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles starts because, <em>no</em> death seems a bit optimistic. He puts on his best grin. \u201cLet\u2019s not-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek growls. \u201cNo death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles says. There\u2019s a clamor from the crowd as presumably the human had just been released.</p>\n<p>Wait. The human. Who doesn\u2019t know that Derek isn\u2019t there to kill him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Stiles says, reaching to grab Derek and stop him. Derek freezes, eyes flashing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe human!\u201d Stiles clarifies, waving a hand in the direction of the ring. \u201cThe human doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re not there to kill him! Which means he\u2019s going to try to kill you!\u201d</p>\n<p>This plan is literally the worst plan in all of history. Derek is going to go out there and get stabbed and Stiles is going to have to go save him and-</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIf he actually comes at me, I\u2019ll just knock him out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sure. Like it\u2019s that easy. An alarming amount of Derek\u2019s stories end with him being beaten up by his <em>younger</em> sister so Stiles isn\u2019t exactly sure where this confidence is coming from. And come to think of it, Derek\u2019s verbal communication skills are not very high either- why did they think Derek was going to be able to talk in front of everyone?</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Derek says, apparently mistaking Stiles\u2019 silence for agreement. \u201cWait here until I give you the cue. Don\u2019t let them see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCue?\u201d Stiles repeats. \u201cWhat cue? Derek, we never talked about-\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek waves a hand at him and then steps out. And, of course, Stiles can\u2019t hear anything because there is cheering and he does wait a few beats, so Derek isn\u2019t still by the door, but then he can\u2019t help but peek out.</p>\n<p>He scans the crowd first, mouth going dry as he realizes just how many werewolves there are. Derek had told him that this was an Alliance of three packs, that despite the attacks, they are still strong but\u2026</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a lot of werewolves. Some half-shifted in anticipation of the fight, some watching with a look of almost boredom that Stiles recognizes, all with their attention completely focused on Derek.</p>\n<p>The three Alphas are there too, sitting in the middle of the benches. They all hold themselves regally, gracing the audience with only small smiles (and Derek got one from his mother, Stiles saw, just a small flash of motherly-pride that Stiles doesn\u2019t quite recognize).</p>\n<p>Stiles turns his attention back to Derek, who isn\u2019t shifted yet, and then to where three werewolves are pushing a human forward and throwing a sword on the ground for him to slowly bend and grab, wincing like he\u2019s already in pain and\u2014</p>\n<p><em>Scott</em>.</p>\n<p>Later, this will be another gap in Stiles\u2019 memory. He will never quite remember how he moves so quickly, how he throws his coat off so his arms are free, how the magic leaps into his hands easily, so <em>unbelievably</em> easily, and he doesn\u2019t even have to focus to use it, how it just <em>flows</em>.</p>\n<p>He will not remember the desperate cry that pushes itself from his lips either, but maybe that\u2019s for the best.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>When Derek hears it, he thinks that something has gone wrong. He\u2019s just entered the ring and he\u2019s waiting until the other werewolves leave, mostly to make sure the human doesn\u2019t rush him immediately, partly so they don\u2019t drag him away the minute he starts talking instead of fighting. He turns, dimly recognizing the human as the young one, who excels at fighting even though he seems to hate it and he has just breathed a silent sigh of relief because this one never attacks first, always waits until he is forced to fight and so Derek thinks that this will be easy but-</p>\n<p>But then Stiles lets out a shout that is anger, horror, and desperation rolled up into one and he is running out, blue energy flying off his hands light lightening and some of it goes <em>into</em> the other human and Derek has no idea what is happening but-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d the human shouts and then he\u2019s moving too, running towards Stiles.</p>\n<p>The two hit each other in a hug that Derek has to assume is painful, though he is still too shocked by the turn of events to really process what is happening.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott, you\u2019re-,\u201d he hears Stiles gasp and the rest is lost because the human starts talking over him and-</p>\n<p>\u201cFURY!\u201d a werewolves yells.</p>\n<p>And with that, the stunned silence breaks.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a wave of movement from the stands, non-warriors pulling their children <em>back</em> as others rush forward, already shifted and snarling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Derek yells, but it\u2019s already too late. His voice is lost in the collective roar of attack and when he looks back, Stiles and Scott have realized the situation. They\u2019ve stepped away from each other, their faces mirror images of determination. Scott is gripping his sword with a purpose that Derek has never seen before and Stiles\u2019 hands are <em>glowing</em> blue, the light casting an eerie hue to his tattoos.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop!\u201d Derek tries, watching as no less than five werewolves jump into the ring to surround the two humans. He\u2019s moving too slowly, not sure how to stop them without actually attacking and people are not even looking at him, but he starts forward anyway-</p>\n<p>And then the Alphas jump down.</p>\n<p>The three of them walk in unison, shifting slowly into their Alpha form, red eyes blazing even in the midday sun, and it\u2019s too late, Derek realizes. It\u2019s too late. Stiles and his friend are surrounded and judging by the way Scott\u2019s eyes flick around and spot the others and the way he shakes his head at Stiles and the way Scott\u2019s hand closes around Stiles\u2019 shoulder \u2013 just for an instant- both the humans know it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Derek tries again, but no one is listening to him and when he tries to step forward, another Beta pushes him <em>back</em> and suddenly Laura is there, pulling him away, but still not <em>listening</em> to him and he sees the moment when it\u2019s about to happen.</p>\n<p>All three Alphas tense and for once, Stiles isn\u2019t grinning, and Derek has already shifted instinctively, driven by the scent of danger and <em>fight</em> and Stiles is going to <em>die</em> and that can\u2019t happen, it <em>can\u2019t</em> and-</p>\n<p>Derek <em>howls</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a howl that comes from deep in his chest and he <em>knows</em> he\u2019s a beta, knows he can\u2019t shift any more than he already has, but something is twisting inside him, hot and sharp, but not painful and-</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flash of blue, a rush of energy, and then Derek dimly recognizes that he\u2019s lower to the ground, but it doesn\u2019t register as wrong.</p>\n<p>He just deepens his howl into a growl, barrels through the ring of betas, and goes and stands where he\u2019s meant to be.</p>\n<p>Between Stiles and <em>threat.</em></p>\n<p>Between Stiles and his pack.</p>\n<p>Between Stiles and anything.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Stiles freezes, so surprised that he loses his grip on his magic completely.</p>\n<p>Scott grabs him and pulls him back, shouldering his way forward so that he is at least half between Stiles and the <em>giant wolf</em> and Stiles doesn\u2019t bother pushing back because-</p>\n<p>He is fairly positive that wolf is <em>Derek.</em></p>\n<p>Derek Hale, Derek. The Derek Hale who, upon last check, was a regular werewolf. Nicer than the werewolves Stiles has known before, a little socially awkward, to be honest, given to often communicating with grunts and eyebrows but not an <em>actual wolf</em>.</p>\n<p>At least the shock of it all means that no one is currently trying to kill them</p>\n<p>Or maybe that\u2019s Derek. Because when one of the Betas around the edge of the circle takes a step forward, Derek turns and <em>growls\u00b8</em> rumbling rising from deep in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott suddenly says, his voice a near-whisper that Stiles is sure all the werewolves hear anyway. Even the ones who have halted in their retreat at the top of the stands and are now simply staring. \u201cThis must be what they were trying to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. Looks at Scott and then back at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Alphas,\u201d Scott says, his voice lower and hoarser than Stiles\u2019 remembers, though maybe that\u2019s from disuse. \u201cWhen they go through those phases where they drain you more often, when-how did he-\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott cuts off and Stiles would think it was in anger except Scott never gets angry and then he doesn\u2019t have time to worry about it because the Alpha in the middle growls and steps forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do to <em>my son</em>?\u201d Her voice is mangled from talking around fangs. She takes another threatening step forward, and this time Derek moves to match her. He doesn\u2019t growl but his ears go back. She stops moving and when she looks up at him again, she looks horrified enough that Stiles feels he should answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm,\u201d Stiles starts. Of course, he doesn\u2019t actually <em>have</em> an answer. How had Derek turned into a <em>wolf</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles didn\u2019t do <em>anything</em>,\u201d Scott protests. \u201cTo get that to work, your <em>son</em>,\u201d Scott directs a glare of judgment down at Derek. \u201cWould have had to drain Stiles for <em>weeks</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks, finally putting Scott\u2019s first statement together. Right. The Alphas did go through periods where they let a single one of them drain all the emissaries as often as possible, and Stiles and Scott had long theorized that they must be trying to <em>achieve</em> something but-</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not drained,\u201d he says, concentrating for a moment to double-check that\u2019s true. It is. His magic is\u2026 calmer now, but it\u2019s still there. Waiting. Ready for him. \u201cDerek never drained me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He glances at Scott as he says this, trying to reassure him that\u2019s he\u2019s not lying.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Talia repeats, slowly. Her voice is on the edge of a growl. Around the circle, the other beta werewolves suddenly tense. The wolf presumed to be Derek snarls. \u201cHow did you know his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shit. Stiles really needs Derek to have vocal chords again. Like right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Stiles tries. \u201cHe-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Talia says. \u201cChange him <em>back</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t change him <em>into</em> a wolf!\u201d Stiles protests. He has to get Scott out of here. And figure out how to change Derek back and he can\u2019t do that if he\u2019s dead. Or two seconds away from being dead. He just needs-</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if you all took a step back,\u201d Scott suddenly suggests, his head cocked to the side as he looks at Derek. \u201cHe seems a little\u2026 protective.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s certainly one way to put it. Derek looks coiled to spring at anyone who so much as scratches an itch. Scott is a genius.</p>\n<p>The oldest of the Alphas \u2013 Stiles is pretty sure her name is Satomi, based on Derek\u2019s description \u2013 steps back first, as do four of the werewolves around the circle. The male, Olin, is next, which leaves just Talia and one dark haired beta, who must be Laura.</p>\n<p>Stiles is about to open his mouth to tell them that they don\u2019t have to back up, that Derek already seems more relaxed, but they step back almost in unison.</p>\n<p>Not too far back though. To be honest, Stiles suspects they could leap forward and kill them both in an instant, maybe even using his preoccupation with Derek as a distraction.</p>\n<p>He flicks his eyes to Scott, who raises one eyebrow and tightens his grip on his sword ever so slightly.</p>\n<p>Well, at least Scott is ready.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he breathes. He takes it as a good sign that Derek\u2019s ears are forward again. \u201cDerek.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ysPclAc.jpg\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" align=\"center\"><br>\n</p>\n<p>Derek turns to look at him and blinks, shaking himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Stiles says, some part of him relaxing. Derek\u2019s eyes somehow look\u2026 still like Derek. They\u2019re intelligent and steady. \u201cDerek, you can, uh, switch back now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to make his voice calm. Friendly, even.</p>\n<p>Derek tilts his head.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know what that means. He has become a master over the past month at dissecting Derek\u2019s nonverbal clues but he isn\u2019t prepared to decode <em>wolf</em> mannerisms and he doesn\u2019t have the eyebrows and Talia Hale is definitely going to kill him. And Scott. Both of them.</p>\n<p>His heart beat must jack up or something because Derek growls again, low in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Scott whispers. His eyes are on the Alphas, but his foot taps a rhythm on the ground. Stiles glances at it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as he guessed: Scott\u2019s foot is pointing towards the nearest exit. Three taps means there\u2019s three werewolves in the way. They could take three, Stiles knows, if he boosts Scott with speed and blasts a wall of fire, it might be able to give them enough time but-</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he says, trying to turn his desperation into something like a command. \u201cChange back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks like maybe he tries then. His head goes down and he squirms a little, but it doesn\u2019t do anything. He is still 100% a wolf.</p>\n<p>Then he lets out a whine, high pitched and-</p>\n<p>They\u2019ll have to take Derek with them, Stiles realizes. If he has time, he can figure this out, he can save him and then Derek can come back here later. When he\u2019s not a wolf.</p>\n<p><em>Okay</em>, Stiles thinks, mind racing. He can do this. He just needs to somehow communicate to Derek that he has to run when Scott gives the signal and then they have to get far enough away that the bonds of pack break so that he can\u2019t be tracked, at least for a little while, and Scott will know that exact point and-</p>\n<p>\u201cYour magic,\u201d Satomi says suddenly. Stiles flinches but she doesn\u2019t move, only raising her voice enough to carry. \u201cMay I see some?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles freezes. Next to him Scott\u2019s eyes squint in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour magic,\u201d the Alpha repeats, ignoring the fact that <em>all</em> of the Betas, including her own, tense at the idea. \u201cI\u2019d like you to do a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA flame will do,\u201d she interrupts. Stiles stiffens, balking at the tone, at the <em>command</em> but then Derek whines again, paw scratching the ground in distress and-</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snaps. It\u2019s nothing he isn\u2019t used to. \u201cHow big do you want it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Probably big enough to drain a good chunk of his magic, if he had to guess. But that\u2019s okay, he\u2019s stronger than he\u2019s ever felt and-</p>\n<p>\u201cAs small as you can make it,\u201d she supplies. There\u2019s a down twitch to her lips that Stiles can\u2019t decipher. It\u2019s almost like she expected him to know the answer or understand it but werewolves never ask for <em>small</em>. They ask for huge and destructive and keep asking until you\u2019re gasping and shuddering on the ground.</p>\n<p>Next to him, Derek turns to look up at him, head tilting in almost a question.</p>\n<p>Stiles concentrates.</p>\n<p>The magic leaps to him too quickly and for a moment he gasps, unprepared for the raw <em>force</em> of it. It\u2019s always felt like rage, an anger deep inside him that\u2019s usually gutted from him on a regular basis, but now\u2026</p>\n<p>Making a <em>small</em> burst of flame doesn\u2019t feel natural. It\u2019s harder than he thought it would be to pull back instead of push forward and even when he gets the flame going, he struggles to propel it into the air without making it <em>bigger</em>. The heat pools in his fingertips and he\u2019s not going to burn himself for the first time in years, but the pain helps him grit his teeth and pull back and what ends up shooting into the air is more than a spark, but not enough to be a threat.</p>\n<p>It still streaks up into the sky for a while. Stiles doesn\u2019t bother watching it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHas it always been blue?\u201d Satomi asks. Stiles frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been so full, so I think-\u201d</p>\n<p>Satomi\u2019s wordless shake of her head cuts him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cLook at his eyes. They are the same color.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s- she\u2019s right, Stiles realizes, looking at Derek. Against the black and dark gray coat of fur, they are dazzling. A blue too deep and bright to be normal.</p>\n<p>Oh god, he did do this.</p>\n<p>\u201cUse your magic,\u201d Satomi orders. Stiles lifts his head to glare at her because, okay, he <em>knows</em> that\u2019s what he has to do but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s done this before and considering half the werewolves in the circle look about ready to kill him, he\u2019s not exactly feeling particularly relaxed at the moment. Satomi seems unaffected by his glare. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably have to touch him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glances at Scott, a wordless plea to watch his back, and then bends down, kneeling on his good leg. Derek sits as well and-</p>\n<p>Fuck, Stiles doesn\u2019t know how to <em>do</em> this. He\u2019s only good at death \u2013 at launching fireballs or propelling knives forward or flinging werewolves back. Even his tricks to help Scott are only to make Scott faster and stronger so that he can fight, to make sure his lungs don\u2019t give out.</p>\n<p>Well, actually that last one is almost close to healing. It\u2019s not permanent but it\u2019s <em>good</em> and\u2014</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a deep breath and focuses. His magic bubbles up quickly, but then he pushes most of it down and reaches towards Derek, hands tinted a soft blue. He\u2019s not used to simply holding his magic without using it, even when there is enough for him to hold. He\u2019s never noticed how his hands glow before. Of course, maybe that is new too.</p>\n<p>His hands settle on Derek\u2019s fur softly and, with Scott it\u2019s just a matter of imaging how he <em>wants</em> Scott to be. It takes only an instant in battle to look over and picture Scott moving faster, of Scott being able to push back against a werewolf and <em>win</em>. His magic takes it from there, leaping out of him and into Scott and it just <em>happens</em>. He doesn\u2019t even have to think about it anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he says, trying to will his magic into Derek\u2019s body somehow. Except Derek feels the same way Scott does when he\u2019s already boosted him enough. There\u2019s nowhere for the magic to <em>go</em> because he already is as fast as he can be and as strong and-</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I need you to come back,\u201d Stiles whispers, clutching his fur a little harder. And it\u2019s not just because if Stiles doesn\u2019t pull this off, he and Scott are definitely going to get killed by werewolves.</p>\n<p>It because\u2026 he just needs Derek to be <em>Derek</em> again. He needs him to be his human-form self with his eyebrows that are constantly dancing across his face and revealing his true emotions and his oddly gentle voice that has never yelled at Stiles, not once, not even when he deserved it. He needs the stubble across his face that Derek rubs at when he\u2019s embarrassed and the soft laugh that bubbles out of his chest when Stiles manages to use humor as something other than a defense mechanism.</p>\n<p>He needs his eyes back. These blue ones are beautiful but he needs <em>Derek</em>\u2019s eyes, the green, hazel, <em>captivating</em> eyes that glint in the moonlight and-</p>\n<p>He feels when his magic starts to flow into Derek, softly and slowly. A tug so slight that he doesn\u2019t seem to actually be losing any, as if it\u2019s drawn from a different source entirely. For a moment, that worries him but then Derek shudders beneath him, his fur disappearing in favor of skin and-</p>\n<p>Yup, Stiles is now holding a naked Derek by the shoulders. In front of his mother. Who wants to kill him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Stiles says, standing and taking a step back as one of the betas steps forward to hand Derek his clothes. \u201cThis has been very nice. We\u2019re just,\u201d - he waves a hand between him and Scott \u2013 \u201cJust gonna take off now. Back to our side of the woods.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luckily all the betas seem a little shell-shocked and the Alphas haven\u2019t taken their eyes off Derek, who is still blinking and looking a little out of it. Scott grabs his shoulder and pulls him back, seemingly agreeing with his plan to get the hell out of here.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood times,\u201d Stiles continues, backing up another step. \u201cDerek, thanks for the- er, you know. Not killing. Thanks to all of you, actually. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. So, we\u2019ll see you. Around.\u201d</p>\n<p>If the stunned silence holds for another few seconds, he and Scott can make a break for it. He already feels Scott getting ready to leap into action.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d this time the order is from Talia, who sounds completely unreadable. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glances towards the exit of the ring. Considers it. Seriously considers it. The werewolves are pretty stunned, they aren\u2019t angry anymore since he fixed Derek and the plan still stands. If they move fast enough, he and Scott might be able to get away but-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek grunts, taking a breath and straightening. \u201cWe said we would explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s grip on his arm doesn\u2019t change, remaining neutral, content to follow whatever decision he makes, even if it means staying with the people who imprisoned and tortured him for a month.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles sighs, glaring at Derek to let him know that this is his fault. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to need food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiles and nods.</p>\n<p>Talia looks ready to murder him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s going about as expected.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2026 that can\u2019t be true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scowls. Considering these are the first words out of Talia\u2019s mouth since the whole story came out, he has to assume this isn\u2019t going well.</p>\n<p>He can understand not believing him. He is a Fury, known for killing people and doing magic and had been hiding out in the woods with her son with ample time to brainwash him. And he\u2019d also just turned aforementioned son into a wolf, so\u2026 yeah, no one has to trust him. But they had let Scott do most of the talking and Scott is the most earnest, trustworthy human on the planet.</p>\n<p>Scott is also currently frowning at her, as if personally offended she hadn\u2019t believed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Stiles interrupts, shifting his weight off his bad leg and wishing he could sit down. They are in Derek\u2019s house and the three Alphas are sitting in chairs around the kitchen table but it had been made abundantly clear that Stiles and Scott are not welcome to sit. Even Derek hadn\u2019t been offered the extra chair.</p>\n<p>They are also clearly not allowed to leave. Laura is standing by the door, and there are four Betas outside. Throw in the fact that the entire village is now on alert, ready to kill anything that moves and, well\u2026</p>\n<p>It would be quite nice if Talia and the other Alphas believed them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMom,\u201d Derek starts.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Talia commands, throwing a glare at Derek that silences him immediately. Stiles has never really considered what sort of trouble Derek could get in for disobeying his Alpha but he\u2019s starting to think they\u2019ll have to take him with them when they bust out of here. Just to be safe.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is true,\u201d Scott says, eyes cutting between Derek and Stiles. \u201cI mean\u2026 how would we make this up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no such thing as a pack of <em>Alphas</em>,\u201d Talia says. Next to her Olin nods in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut there is,\u201d Stiles says, stepping forward. \u201cWe think they all killed their own Alpha years ago and then their betas to get stronger. It\u2019s what they <em>do</em> when-\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops himself abruptly. Adding that detail isn\u2019t going to make the werewolves feel any more inclined to help them. After all, the humans are the ones that capture those betas in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen they what?\u201d Satomi cuts in, speaking for the first time. Her voice is iron but Stiles and Scott still glance at each other.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no hiding it though. Not now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we capture betas,\u201d Scott finally says softly. \u201cThat\u2019s- They get forced into a pack and then-\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott stops. He is never going to be able to say it. Scott can\u2019t even watch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoever is technically their Alpha kills them,\u201d Stiles finishes. \u201cWe think it makes them stronger. Or that mixed with the emissary magic they usually take right after.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott is the one that believes emissary magic might have something to do with it. Stiles thinks it\u2019s just a rush for them. He thinks they like slashing their claws across a beta\u2019s throat and then sinking them into an emissary without even wiping off the blood first.</p>\n<p>When he glances over again, all the Alphas have paled.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d Olin says. \u201cThat\u2019s <em>impossible</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles squints. Definitely not impossible. He\u2019s seen it. He\u2019s been there.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo kill your own beta is\u2026 an <em>abomination</em>,\u201d Satomi says and even she sounds shaken. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d Talia says and her voice is firm. She\u2019s made up her mind. \u201cThis entire story is <em>ridiculous</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would we lie?\u201d Stiles tries, not bothering to keep the annoyance from his voice. He had been afraid that the werewolves wouldn\u2019t want to help, that decades of attacks would mean that it didn\u2019t matter if the humans were being controlled by outside forces. He assumed that if he were allowed to tell the full story, they would at least <em>believe</em> him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Talia growls. \u201cTo save your own skin, or, more likely, to lead us into a trap. What I <em>do</em> know is that you\u2019ve already brainwashed my son and somehow <em>turned him into a wolf</em> and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles didn\u2019t brainwash me!\u201d Derek says, stepping forward and finally getting a sentence in. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even <em>awake</em> when I found him and decided not to kill him. He didn\u2019t do <em>anything</em>. <em>I</em> did. I decided to nurse him back to health and sneak him food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia\u2019s eye flash red. \u201cThen I will deal with you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBut he\u2019s telling the truth. Are you even <em>listening</em> to their heartbeats?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a Fury couldn\u2019t learn to lie,\u201d Talia starts, half-rising and-</p>\n<p>\u201cI can prove it,\u201d Stiles blurts. Both Scott and Derek turn to frown at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Olin says.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Stiles says, even though it\u2019s anything but. \u201cYou can see for yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He forces his voice to come out like a challenge, almost aggressive because that\u2019s easier than being scared. It\u2019s always been easier.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t realize what he\u2019s offering right away. No one does.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already told you about the magic and the\u2026\u201d he stops and works saliva into his mouth. \u201cThe memory stuff. So if you won\u2019t believe us, then use it. See for yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He goes to take a step forward and finds himself pulled back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Scott says, his voice almost a growl.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says at the same time, striding forward. He\u2019s partially shifted, eyes glowing blue. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at both of them. This isn\u2019t their decision. It\u2019s his.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d he says, focusing on Derek. Derek doesn\u2019t get to tell him what to do. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d Scott says. \u201cIt\u2019s- there has to be another way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cThis is easiest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t believe us, Scott!\u201d Stiles interrupts, letting some of his panic take over for just a moment. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe us and there are eight werewolves within spitting distance that want to <em>kill</em> us and both of us have been away for a <em>month</em>. Our parents probably think we\u2019re <em>dead</em> and we\u2019re going to be if we don\u2019t get this handled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re <em>doing</em>,\u201d Scott insists, waving a hand at the Alphas dismissively. \u201cStiles, it doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re alive if you\u2019re not-\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. They both know the ending anyway. It\u2019s not like the rest of the human camp doesn\u2019t know about Deaton, who once knew almost everything about the Alphas and who now wanders the camp having to be told when to eat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Stiles repeats, glad that Scott isn\u2019t a werewolf. That he can\u2019t hear Stiles\u2019 heart stutter over that sentence. He turns to Talia. \u201cOkay. So just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Derek growls again and there\u2019s suddenly a tug on Stiles\u2019 magic as if it <em>wants</em> to flow into Derek. Luckily, it stops when Derek turns to his mother, all challenge and anger. \u201cMom, if you do this, I will <em>never</em> forgive you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Derek</em>,\u201d Talia says and her voice is angry but Stiles hears the pitch of hurt underneath. He has his mouth open to tell Derek to just <em>relax</em> when Satomi beats him to the punch.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s right,\u201d She says, stepping forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Talia, but you\u2019re too close to this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia\u2019s eyes actually flash at that and Stiles remembers Derek telling him that an Alliance between packs is rare because Alphas are not supposed to get along. They\u2019re all too used to being in charge.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s your <em>son</em>,\u201d Satomi continues. \u201cAnd you have every right to be angry but we\u2019re playing with forces we don\u2019t understand. Anger can\u2019t come into this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia\u2019s mouth twists into an unhappy scowl, but after a beat, she nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Satomi says. \u201cSo I\u2019ll do it. Unless, Olin, you\u2019d like to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Satomi inclines her head to the third Alpha in the room and Stiles has to assume it\u2019s at least partly to make up for the display of authority she\u2019d just made but-</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Scott says, stepping forward again. \u201c<em>None</em> of you know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019ve never seen what this can <em>do</em> or what <em>happens</em> or what it\u2019s like when he can\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott,\u201d Stiles says. He can\u2019t think about that right now \u2013 the hours spent yanking on his own hair, crying silently, trying so hard to <em>remember</em> her, anything about her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>have</em>,\u201d Scott spits, ignoring him. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t some stupid <em>Alpha politics</em> game that you are going to play.\u201d</p>\n<p>He points to Satomi.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it,\u201d he orders. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t trust any of you but at least you seem to have <em>some</em> idea what you\u2019re talking about. So it\u2019s you. No one else or the deal\u2019s off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles raises his eyebrows because that\u2019s a ridiculous statement considering this isn\u2019t exactly a negotiation. Then raises them even higher when all three Alphas nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t take <em>anything</em>,\u201d Scott continues. \u201cNot a drop of magic or a single memory. If it feels like you\u2019re pulling anything out, you stop. I don\u2019t care if you want to try to kill us afterwards, you stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott doesn\u2019t sound angry anymore, merely terrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Satomi promises. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p>\n<p>To be honest, it doesn\u2019t help as much as Stiles would like it to because he has no reason to trust Satomi at all, but it makes Scott relax. At least, he sags as if defeated. Which means at least he agrees.</p>\n<p>A spike of fear travels up Stiles\u2019 spine.</p>\n<p>This is <em>happening</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Derek says, shoving Laura\u2019s hand off him when she tries to hold him back. \u201cWhy does <em>anyone </em>have to do this? Why can\u2019t you just trust <em>me</em> even if you don\u2019t trust him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re bonded,\u201d Satomi says a bit harshly, a crack in her usually calm exterior. Even the other Alphas still to look at her. \u201cThere are stories \u2013 old stories \u2013 about werewolves whose eyes turn blue, werewolves who can work with humans and achieve the True shift but they\u2019re <em>stories</em>. We don\u2019t know what it means. For all we know, it means that this Fury <em>has</em> brainwashed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The whole room is sort of gaping at her and Stiles feels his heart start hammering. He doesn\u2019t know what any of this means either. He hadn\u2019t <em>meant </em>to bond Derek or whatever it was called. Fuck, he doesn\u2019t even know what he did. Or when he did it.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth opens and closes but Satomi continues after barely a pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to listen to two <em>humans</em>,\u201d Satomi continues, her voice calm once again. \u201cNo, a <em>Fury</em> and a human who want us to go to war. We have to be positive they are telling the truth. And right now, you aren\u2019t a reliable witness.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one says anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says into the stillness. He can\u2019t worry about what Satomi just said. About being <em>bonded</em> to Derek. He can\u2019t. Because this is going to happen. The arguments are over.</p>\n<p>He knows his heart is hammering but that\u2019s okay. He can do this. Or he has to. Either way.</p>\n<p>\u201cClear the table,\u201d Scott orders. \u201cHe needs to lie down.\u201d Stiles wants to disagree but can\u2019t. The few times he\u2019d been selected for a post-kill draining, two other werewolves had had to hold him up while another drained him and the end result was him collapsed on the ground the moment they let go.</p>\n<p>Lying down is better.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could use my bed,\u201d Derek offers and Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Scott says, glaring around the room at all of them. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do this, let\u2019s at least use a bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Scott</em>,\u201d Stiles growls. They have to stop putting this off. It\u2019s just making it worse. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for <em>years</em>. A table is <em>fine</em>. It doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s just- let\u2019s just do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He moves forward and sits on the table, making it clear he\u2019s not moving. He doesn\u2019t want to walk to Derek\u2019s room; he doesn\u2019t want to drag this out any more than he has to. If he does, he\u2019ll start thinking and maybe panicking and this is no different from the hundreds of other times he\u2019s been drained. He\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>He tries to communicate all of that as he locks eyes with Scott and he sees that his friend is still unhappy, maybe even furious, but he doesn\u2019t argue. Just-</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need a bucket,\u201d Scott snaps, breaking eye contact first. \u201cAnd a glass of water and a warm cloth. And a clean shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re pushing it</em>, Stiles wants to say because they\u2019ve never had those things before, but he doesn\u2019t. Partly because Laura is already moving to get them and partly because fear has closed his throat.</p>\n<p>He needs to get this over with. If he doesn\u2019t, he might back out.</p>\n<p>So, he takes a breath and lays down, feeling his chest warm with something like terror and hating that even though he <em>knows</em> it\u2019s not the same, it feels like it is. The way his hip bones jut against the wood of the table and he tilts his head the same direction, so she has easier access, eyes already squeezed closed and he knows to reach his hands up and grab onto the edge of the table and-</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when it changes. Because Scott\u2019s never been allowed to be with him, but he\u2019s here now and one of his hands brushes against Stiles\u2019 until it loosens its grip on the table and transfers to Scott.</p>\n<p>And, fuck, he\u2019s terrified. He knows Derek is there and he knows Satomi has vowed not to take anything but it would be so easy. It would be so easy for her to take everything \u2013 his magic and all his memories \u2013 and it would be so easy for them to contain Derek and kill Scott and he <em>hates</em> this. The vulnerability of being stretched out, just waiting until they do whatever they want and he\u2019d gotten <em>used</em> to his magic. To feeling like he can fight back.</p>\n<p>He clutches down on Scott\u2019s hand fiercely.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott starts.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he grits out.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t flinch when Satomi touches his shoulder with one hand, or when her other rests on his neck. He doesn\u2019t flinch because he\u2019s learned that if you flinch sometimes they miss and then they have to come out and dig in again and the other hand holding you steady clamps down viciously and you\u2019ll have bruises around your arm for days and if you do flinch too badly, they call in one of the others to help hold you and-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just better to stay still. Even when the claws come out and dig in.</p>\n<p>Stiles whimpers as her claws break the skin, the fact that the feeling is now familiar doesn\u2019t help at all with the pain and he squeezes Scott\u2019s hand and wonders if it\u2019s actually worse that she\u2019s trying to go slow because it takes her a little while to break through the muscle to the bone of his spine.</p>\n<p>And then she hits and he forces himself to remember to breathe, panting and-</p>\n<p>He was right. It is instinctual. His magic is flowing up to her, the same hot, stabbing pain piercing his body and he bites down on a groan that\u2019s about to break free anyway.</p>\n<p>Then, suddenly it\u2019s gone. He almost <em>feels</em> her forcibly stop draining him, a flash of heat against his spine and then the suction stops.</p>\n<p>He manages one breath of air before she refocuses.</p>\n<p>The pain is in his head this time and suddenly he can\u2019t think.</p>\n<p>All he can do is remember.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s thorough. She starts at his earliest memories \u2013 <em>Scott, hunger, his dad returning from battle bloodied and broken</em> \u2013 and at first she seems not to know how to move faster or skip forward and Stiles is afraid he\u2019s going to have to relive all of it but she gains speed and-</p>\n<p>His life whizzes before him. Sword fights with Scott and finding a patch of berries that they ate before realizing they would make you sick and-</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a gap there that he feels her hesitate over. She glides back and forth, searching for something that\u2019s long been removed and <em>it\u2019s gone</em>, he tries to tell her. <em>It\u2019s gone and it\u2019s never coming back.</em></p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know if she can hear him but she gives up quickly and moves on.</p>\n<p>She speeds through most of it, through the long days of training and starving and training some more. She only pauses when it\u2019s important, when he found out he was a Fury, when they drained him for the first time, when he witnessed his first death.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s pathetically grateful that she only watches the first few moments of his tattoo before skipping forward. That she does the same with the moment when his family realized what had been taken.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only as she gets closer that he realizes she\u2019s going to find out about the two werewolves, the two that only three people in the world know about. He thinks his father and Melissa suspect, but they\u2019ve carefully never asked and he and Scott never volunteered the information. It\u2019s just the three of them: him, Scott, and Derek.</p>\n<p>And now maybe Satomi.</p>\n<p>He panics, trying to jerk his head away because she can\u2019t see that, she can\u2019t <em>know</em> and then he tries to hide it somehow, to wrap the memories closer so she won\u2019t find them and-</p>\n<p>\n<em>The werewolf is old. It\u2019s the only reason he and Scott were able to defeat her on their own and Stiles is gasping, worn out from having pushed so much of his magic into Scott (not that Scott is much better and Stiles has to figure that out, has to fix that somehow) and they\u2019ve managed to beat her, but only just.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDo it,\u201d he says, forcing his eyes to the trees and blinking away the spots that rise to his vision. They have to get Scott a band, to get him on steady rations. Stiles\u2019 allotment isn\u2019t enough for all four of them and they\u2019ve both lost too much weight and so have their </em>parents <em>and he and Scott have taken to sleeping rather than training and he knows what that means and-</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>They need this. It\u2019s why they had risked going off by themselves even though all the other teenagers stick to the safety of numbers. They can afford to get the half-ration offered those who merely assist.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Scott and Stiles can\u2019t.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Scott takes a step towards the dazed werewolf and his arm is shaking as he holds up his sword. Stiles doesn\u2019t even notice it right away because it\u2019s been a long battle and both of them shake more often than not these days.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He\u2019s moving too slowly and Stiles sucks in a breath, trying to scrape the bottom of his magic and see if there\u2019s any shred he could boost Scott with but there\u2019s-</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cS-Stiles,\u201d Scott gasps and Stiles finally looks over.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Scott is terrified. His chest is heaving and his hand is spasming around the hilt of his blade and his eyes are filled with tears and- \u201cI c-can\u2019t. She-\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>She\u2019s practically unconscious now, unshifted and lying in a heap almost at the edge of Stiles\u2019 Mountain Ash circle.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Stiles would say they could capture her, but that would just get the other humans involved and Scott would be stuck with half-rations. The end result would be the same anyway. She\u2019s going to end up dead and at least this way it\u2019s quicker and they </em>need the food<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says straightening. \u201cOkay, Scott, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He takes a step closer, careful not to disturb the Mountain Ash and then reaches and takes the sword from Scott. It\u2019s been dosed with Wolfsbane and etched with runes Stiles learned from the other emissaries.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It falls out of Scott\u2019s grip too easily and Scott clutches as his shirt as he passes and-</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d Stiles orders and steps forward.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The sword slides in easier than he thought it would, but the sound is much worse and-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Mercifully, Satomi skips forward. Faster this time too and he hopes for a second that she won\u2019t even register the next one. But,</p>\n<p>\n<em>At least it\u2019s faster- the second one.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s mid-battle and Stiles already knows that Scott can\u2019t do it and he the werewolf isn\u2019t old this time, merely overly confident since he is fighting two teenagers that are still too skinny by half. Regardless of the reason, he is making sloppy mistakes and-</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Stiles doesn\u2019t think about it. He sees his opening and leaps and when he hits the werewolf\u2019s back, he slides his blade across the man\u2019s neck before he has the opportunity to throw him off. Warmth splashes across his hand and Scott stares at him, stunned, for half a beat before he is shaking himself and coming forward to wipe it off, taking the knife gently as he does so.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>They don\u2019t have time, they have to get their proof and get back with the others, but Scott takes the time to wrap his arms around him and just </em>hold him<em> and Stiles wants to push him away but he doesn\u2019t.</em></p>\n<p>Satomi skips most of it after that. She ignores the near constant drainings and the attempts to learn to knife throw and-</p>\n<p>She gets to Derek sooner than Stiles thought she would. And she watches their first few interactions and Stiles doesn\u2019t try to stop her, figures that this will be where she digs for clues that he\u2019s brainwashed Derek or used some form of magic.</p>\n<p>But suddenly she\u2019s pulling out. Before it\u2019s even over. It\u2019s oddly gently and he\u2019s not sure what she\u2019s doing at first, if she\u2019s going to try something else but then she\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>As always, the blood from the wounds is what he registers first, liquid trailing down the sides of his neck now that there\u2019s nothing holding it in and his vision doesn\u2019t work yet, but he\u2019s knows to use his arms to push himself up and blindly roll to the side.</p>\n<p>The wave of nausea hits and Scott\u2019s hand in his hair directs him to the bucket. It\u2019s not bad, just two heaves. It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s usually worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d Scott says, almost frantically when he finishes. \u201cStiles? Who are you? Who am I? What\u2019s your dad\u2019s name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Stiles replies, spitting once more in the bucket and sighing in relief when the warm cloth hits the back of his neck. \u201cScott. John.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is raspy but he doesn\u2019t ache like he usually does.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid she take anything?\u201d Scott insists. Wordlessly, Stiles shakes his head. He just needs-</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d he tells Scott, wiping one hand across his eyes. He sits up, keeping his breathing even as he swings his legs over. He\u2019ll be able to move in a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t lying,\u201d Satomi says finally. \u201cThey- it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Alphas?\u201d Olin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo the humans are innocent?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flinches at the word, keeping his eyes shut. They both know that\u2019s not true. She knows what really happened. What Stiles has done.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replies, voice betraying nothing. Stiles can\u2019t help but wonder if her heart skipped a beat. \u201cWe need to discuss this. Alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s his cue. Stiles pushes himself closer to the edge, reaching for Scott to help him steady himself as he stands.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Talia Hale says and she\u2019s frowning at him. Maybe in annoyance. Maybe in concern. It\u2019s impossible to say. His vision is still too blurry to make out details. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave. You three stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at her in surprise.</p>\n<p>Olin and Satomi head for the door first, marching out with only a goodbye glance of their eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe guards stay,\u201d Talia says. Stiles nods at that. Like he could forget they are still prisoners. \u201cBut they won\u2019t come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Scott replies, accepting the gesture with an air of caution. Talia nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, you stay here too,\u201d she orders. \u201cAnd make sure they eat something.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then she\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t quite sure what\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>After four weeks of only interacting with Stiles at the bottom of a canyon, usually in the middle of the night, it\u2019s bizarre to have him suddenly in his kitchen, sitting in Laura\u2019s usual spot like he belongs there, grinning as Scott introduces himself to Derek \u201cproperly\u201d and then outright snorting as Derek fumbles to explain that he <em>didn\u2019t</em> drain Stiles (just to clarify, because Scott had looked pretty furious earlier). It\u2019s strange to think that this is the first time he\u2019s seen Stiles sit in a chair, the first time he\u2019s seen Stiles use a regular cup, the first time that Derek gets to cook for him <em>properly</em>, with a real wood stove and meat that hasn\u2019t already been salted into jerky. For some reason, Derek is captivated by watching Stiles using a fork, his eyes helpless to do anything but track his tattoos as they flicker and dance with such a simple movement.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange to see Stiles fret over someone. But when he finally slides into a chair and Scott winces as he does the same, suddenly Stiles is demanding that Scott left up his shirt so he can inspect the deep bruises that cover Scott\u2019s ribcage and it\u2019s clear in an instant that there are no boundaries between these two. Stiles pokes at a bruise and Scott shoves him off playfully, hand rubbing over Stiles\u2019 cropped hair as he pushes him aside, even as Stiles suddenly catches his bottom lip between his teeth and glances up at Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t need him to ask the question aloud. He walks forward immediately, holding a hand out for Scott to grab. Scott grins at him, already more trusting than Stiles ever was and the smile Stiles sends him over Scott\u2019s exhale of relief is like nothing Derek has ever seen before.</p>\n<p>So, yes, it\u2019s strange, but also <em>wonderful</em> because Stiles looks <em>right</em> somehow. His smiles are softer and rise to his face easier and he swings his head to include Derek in them, even though it makes his neck start bleeding twice more despite the \u201cfreaky werewolf healing\u201d that usually causes them to close up faster. (<em>Can\u2019t have us walking around with holes in our neck, dude.</em>)</p>\n<p>Scott attacks his meal with an intensity that has Stiles frowning and Derek flushing because he <em>knows</em> Scott hasn\u2019t been fed properly in a month. But Scott is talking around mouthfuls of food anyway, demanding to hear more and more detail of Stiles\u2019 month and, when Stiles is forced to admit that he\u2019d spent most of it chilling in the woods, so bored he\u2019d named a fish that he\u2019d never managed to catch, Scott turns his open, easy smile to Derek.</p>\n<p>And so Derek talks. Or tries to. Luckily, Stiles manages to take over about half his stories \u2013 even the ones from the beginning, when Derek hadn\u2019t even thought he\u2019d been listening because Stiles listening while glaring and holding his knife in a white-knuckled grip.</p>\n<p>They avoid certain topics \u2013 Scott and Stiles\u2019 parents, the \u201ctraining\u201d that Scott had been used for, the fact that Derek and Stiles are now bonded. It\u2019s avoidance, yes, but it doesn\u2019t feel stilted. It\u2019s just\u2026</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to enjoy the little things. For now.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Scott starts yawning and though Derek can see that he is fighting to stay awake, Stiles is on him in an instant.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should get some rest,\u201d Stiles declares and then ignores Scott\u2019s frown of protest. \u201cCan he use your bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Derek replies and Scott opens his mouth to say something but only a yawn comes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says eventually, standing. \u201cI- it\u2019s all the food I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFatty,\u201d Stiles mutters, entirely fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuscular,\u201d Scott corrects, even though it\u2019s not quite true anymore. Idly, Derek wonders if it ever was.</p>\n<p>Guilt twists in his stomach and some of it must show in his face, because Stiles is suddenly jabbing him in the side, insisting that he give them the tour of the mansion and he has to insist about a hundred times that it\u2019s alright for Scott to curl up on his bed and-</p>\n<p>And then suddenly it\u2019s just him and Stiles again.</p>\n<p>They stand in the doorway to his bedroom, Stiles seemingly unwilling to let Scott out of his sight and maybe Derek is imagining it, but he swears he can <em>feel</em> the heat of Stiles\u2019 magic as they stand next to each other.</p>\n<p>At least, he feels something.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really think they\u2019re gonna help?\u201d Stiles asks, raising one eyebrow and one side of his mouth into a smirk that is an almost even mixture of doubt and hope.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says. He\u2019s not lying. He\u2019d seen Satomi\u2019s face when she pulled her fingers out of Stiles\u2019 neck. There was horror there, yes, but also resolve and anger and \u2013 they\u2019re going to help. Derek knows it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I will,\u201d Derek replies.</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts and ducks his head and Derek feels an embarrassed blush start to spread across his cheeks but the next moment, Stiles is looking up at him, smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust you, me, and Scott?\u201d he asks. His voice is light, teasing almost but\u2026 it\u2019s a gentle tease. Happy, almost. \u201cThe three of us against a pack of Alphas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek replies, putting some of Stiles\u2019 usual bravado into his voice. \u201cI can turn into a wolf now. No problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything, not at first, and Derek assumes that they are going to talk about it, about being \u201cbonded\u201d or what that means or how that even <em>happened</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead Stiles just takes a breath and his eyes look towards Scott again, but he leans closer, close enough that their shoulders are touching.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says finally, exhaling slowly. His voice is soft, almost peaceful. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t nod, afraid to move lest the motion make Stiles jerk away, but he smiles and he feels like Stiles knows.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sounds good.</em>\n</p>\n<p>End.</p>"
