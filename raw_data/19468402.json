  "text": "<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In the beginning, Crowley spun the constellations into being.</p>\n<p>He had another name, then\u2014one that Aziraphale murmured to himself, the sounds bright and clear as a bell on his tongue. Crowley was a highly ranked member of the Choir of Thrones, and trusted with star design and development. Aziraphale saw him sometimes in all-staff meetings, sitting toward the front but off to the side, lounging against a wall. Even then, he\u2019d had <i>style</i>\u2014wings tipped in gold and face painted with gold flakes in the pattern of the first constellation he designed. He was amazing, and eye-catching, and it was no exaggeration to say that he did not know Aziraphale even existed.</p>\n<p>And why should he? Aziraphale was created a Principality, whose duties would be to tend to nations of humans. Humans who didn\u2019t even exist yet, although the Almighty said She was going to get around to it, don\u2019t rush Her, go get Her a sakura matcha frappuccino, there\u2019s a dear.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale invented the sakura matcha frappuccino before the Earth was made; he fretted about it during the process, but apparently he\u2019d done well enough. </p>\n<p>Crowley-that-was seemed to be brimming with so much personality, so many <i>questions</i>\u2014next to him, Aziraphale felt bland, undistinguished, utterly unremarkable. He could barely remember his fellow Principalities; back then, they all seemed like they were just waiting for the Almighty to finally make use of them.</p>\n<p>Once, Crowley-that-was ducked into a large meeting late. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d he asked Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked behind him, because surely this Throne was not addressing him, but there was no one else nearby. \u201cErm,\u201d he said, feeling utterly flustered. \u201cGabriel was just saying\u2014we\u2019re, um\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d the angel prompted. His hair was dark, and his eyes\u2014Aziraphale hadn\u2019t been close enough to see before, but his eyes were blue like the hottest of the stars he\u2019d hung in the galaxies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re on\u2014on schedule,\u201d Aziraphale finished, and he could almost physically feel the angel lose interest in him.</p>\n<p>It was the last he saw Crowley-that-was up close until the day he stood up behind the Morning Star, and Aziraphale felt his breath catch. Surely he wasn\u2019t\u2014he wouldn\u2019t\u2014</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d always hung around them, those who finally Rebelled. He\u2019d always slouched off to the side, offering witty comments here and there, jokes that Aziraphale didn\u2019t understand but smiled at anyway. He was always there, unreachable, untouchable, and now\u2014</p>\n<p>Aziraphale found himself face to face with him, for what he thought was the last time. Aziraphale had been issued a sword\u2014just a standard one, not the flaming kind. He supposed he knew how to use it, but he didn\u2019t like it, and he wasn\u2019t very good. His hands shook as he pointed it at the angel.</p>\n<p>The angel\u2019s eyes were wild, full of confusion and despair. He bore a shield and a flaming sword, and dispatched Aziraphale\u2019s sword in short order.</p>\n<p>Fat lot of good the sword had done him, Aziraphale thought, tears gathering in his eyes. He hadn\u2019t even had a chance to become <i>useful</i> yet\u2014he hadn\u2019t done anything yet, nothing at all. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, and lowered his head.</p>\n<p>He waited for the sword to strike his neck, but instead he heard two sounds\u2014the angel\u2019s sword and shield clattering to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is madness,\u201d the angel said hoarsely. \u201cI won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>All around them, angels were dying and Falling.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d Aziraphale said uncertainly. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The angel, whose name Aziraphale held close as his dearest secret, closed his eyes in grief. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p>\n<p>The angel\u2019s eyes opened again. \u201cHow can you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale wetted his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you. I\u2019ve always, always\u2014and I know you didn\u2019t think it would be like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The angel reached out and brushed a fingertip across Aziraphale\u2019s cheek, and his eyes were still that brightly burning blue like the star Rigel that he\u2019d hung in Orion\u2019s belt, because even then, he\u2019d cared about aesthetics.</p>\n<p>And then, without looking back at Aziraphale, he walked away, took a swan dive\u2014</p>\n<p>\u2014and Fell.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>An eternity passed, seemingly in an instant, and then Aziraphale was finally permitted to be useful. He was stationed at the Eastern Gate of the Garden, and also on apple tree duty. It was all very nerve-wracking, finally having two charges and a thing he was meant to keep them away from. It was his first real job and he didn\u2019t want to make a hash of it. </p>\n<p>He watched the humans closely, and the apple tree closely. Not that the humans seemed enormously interested in the apple tree at all; they\u2019d just discovered that their\u2014<i>parts</i>\u2014fit together in an apparently quite pleasurable way and were, as such, occupied.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, it was a bit lonely in the Garden. There were no other angels stationed there\u2014which, he supposed, made sense, since there were as of yet only two humans to watch. The days were all lovely, and Her Creation was lovelier still, but his assignment was to watch the humans, not talk to them.</p>\n<p>So when a large serpent slithered up and hissed a greeting, Aziraphale was rather less on his guard than perhaps he should have been. How was he to know that snakes weren\u2019t supposed to talk? And all right, perhaps he ought to have smelled the brimstone and put two and two together, but instead, he just said, \u201cOh, hello, what a handsome fellow you are!\u201d</p>\n<p>The serpent froze, and then said uncertainly, \u201cThank you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t incredibly clear, given that a snake\u2019s ability for verbal communication was limited, and then the serpent made a sinuous wiggle that conveyed <i>frustration</i> as well as a bit of <i>you don\u2019t mind if I\u2014</i></p>\n<p>Aziraphale said, \u201cOh, please, go right ahead,\u201d without at all knowing what he was agreeing to.</p>\n<p>And then the serpent shifted form, and Aziraphale gasped, because it\u2014he?\u2014was a <i>demon</i>, and not just that, he was\u2014</p>\n<p>The angel who spared Aziraphale\u2019s life shook out his long red hair and his soot-black wings, and settled on the rock next to Aziraphale. \u201cBetter,\u201d he said, and cracked his neck. \u201cNice form for a snooze in the sun, but not great for a chat, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said. He couldn\u2019t stop staring\u2014the demon\u2019s eyes were Rigel-bright no longer, but yellow and slitted. And yes, there was that scent of brimstone, impossible to ignore now that he\u2019d properly noticed it.</p>\n<p>The demon cleared his throat. \u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with the, er. Human-watching.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both looked across the Garden, where the humans were making those noises again that meant they were in the middle of\u2014well.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey seem busy,\u201d Aziraphale said delicately.</p>\n<p>The demon snorted. \u201cOne way of putting it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale was still staring, which he had an idea was actually quite rude, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019d spent so long watching him; he wasn\u2019t at all prepared for casual conversation. He fumbled for a return volley. \u201cAnd, um, how is it going with\u2014with whatever you\u2019re meant to be doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>The demon shrugged. \u201cEarly days,\u201d he said. He leaned back on the rock, propped up on his elbows, and lifted his face to the sun. \u201cHave you tried those grapes on the western wall?\u201d he said after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean, <i>eaten</i> them?\u201d Aziraphale said, a little scandalized.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t talking about doing anything else with them,\u201d the demon said sardonically.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale tried to imagine for a moment what the demon meant, and gave it up as a bad job. \u201cIt\u2019s food for the humans and the rest of Her creatures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems like you ought to experience some things from their perspective,\u201d the demon said, all too reasonably. \u201cWould help with the watching, I expect, if you knew more about why they do what they do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale thought about it. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cWhy those grapes, in particular?\u201d</p>\n<p>A corner of the demon\u2019s mouth crooked up into a half-smile that Aziraphale knew, oh, very well indeed. \u201cSomething a bit odd\u2019s happening to them. Something to do with the sun and tiny tiny fungus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I see the appeal,\u201d Aziraphale said, wrinkling his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter to try it before the humans do,\u201d the demon said. \u201cThat way, you can keep them out of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was how he found himself lying in the soft grass along the western wall with a demon, eating grapes that seemed like they might be a bit off, somehow? But they made him feel rather floaty, and well, giggly. The demon was likewise affected, and they talked a great deal of nonsense, until the sun set and they invented being extremely, extremely drunk.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh,\u201d the demon said, as they looked up at the constellation Orion. \u201cIt came out pretty well, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Aziraphale said, and turned his head a bit to look at him. \u201cYou remember it, then?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p>\n<p>The demon shrugged. \u201cA bit, yeah. Broad strokes, but the details are fuzzy.\u201d He was silent for a long beat. \u201cI can\u2019t remember my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was on the tip of Aziraphale\u2019s tongue, and he wanted so badly to say it, but there was so much pain in the demon\u2019s eyes that he thought he\u2019d better not.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t remember yours, either,\u201d the demon said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t know it, to begin with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d the demon said. \u201cMust have done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, trust me,\u201d Aziraphale said, wistful.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I know your eyes,\u201d the demon said, and Aziraphale\u2019s breath caught. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, angel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said, and swallowed hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale,\u201d the demon said slowly, as though tasting every syllable. He would have given anything to hear his name from those lips before, and even now, it sent a thrill down his spine. \u201cAnother grape, Aziraphale?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re asleep,\u201d the demon said, and held up a grape to Aziraphale\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more,\u201d Aziraphale conceded, and allowed the demon to feed him the grape, and licked the fermented juice from his lips.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>So, all right then: they invented getting drunk. They then invented getting hungover, which they both agreed was terrible and best avoided in the future. And he was still so flummoxed that the demon was, after all this, the angel he\u2019d watched for so long, that he rather forgot about the whole demon thing. The thing was\u2014the demon didn\u2019t seem all that demonic. He spent most of his time in serpent form, napping in the sun. The rest of it, he spent engaged in what Aziraphale thought was mild blasphemy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s constructive criticism,\u201d the demon insisted. \u201cTake that, for example.\u201d He pointed at the duck-billed platypus. \u201cWhat, and I can\u2019t emphasize this enough, the fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIneffable,\u201d Aziraphale said, because he was likewise befuddled but unwilling to admit it.</p>\n<p>And then Aziraphale took his eyes off him for one minute\u2014one damned minute\u2014and suddenly the humans were eating apples and there was <i>such</i> a fuss, and Aziraphale gave the humans his flaming sword as they fled the Garden, and oh \u2014</p>\n<p>He\u2019d really messed everything up, hadn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p>And the angel he\u2019d watched for so long was a demon, one who was calling himself Crawley and had forgotten his beautiful, beautiful name. He was still just as eye-catching as before, but there was a sorrow that sung through him now, a grief that made Aziraphale\u2019s eyes well up just to think about it.</p>\n<p>And perhaps Crawley was right\u2014perhaps he\u2019d done the right thing, and Aziraphale had done the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat will we do now?\u201d Aziraphale said, as the storm subsided. He was all wet and didn\u2019t think he cared for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way out but through,\u201d Crawley said prosaically. He was perfectly dry from sheltering under Aziraphale\u2019s wing. \u201cComing, angel?\u201d</p>\n<p>He followed Crawley out into the desert, leaving the Garden behind.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Suddenly, there were rather a lot more than two humans, and Aziraphale started receiving more specific assignments.</p>\n<p>Evidently, Crawley\u2014now calling himself Crowley, and Aziraphale would never have imagined that one could just <i>change one\u2019s name</i>\u2014was receiving specific assignments, too.</p>\n<p>Even with more humans, it hadn\u2019t become any less lonely. Other angels popped in and out, mostly to deliver messages to the humans, even though Aziraphale had told them time and again that appearing in angelic form frightened the humans terribly. He himself had learned to tuck his wings out of this plane of existence, to try to blend in. It had been Crowley who had the idea, but he\u2019d always been clever, and Aziraphale wasn\u2019t too proud to follow his lead in this particular matter.</p>\n<p>He watched Crowley when he could\u2014it was part of his official duties now, he reckoned\u2014but it didn\u2019t lessen his desire for Crowley\u2019s company, now that he\u2019d had a taste.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t lessen his desire to have Crowley look at <i>him</i>, and he knew what hunger was, now\u2014surely that was what he felt, every time Crowley turned his remarkable gaze upon him, as though Aziraphale were something worth noticing.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>It was when he happened upon Crowley in Rome that he stopped looking for hints of the angel he had been, and began to love him just as he was. And oh\u2014it was heady and terrifying and he shuddered to think what would happen if anyone from Above found out, but he couldn\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t that he forgot that Crowley was Fallen, but in moments like these, it didn\u2019t seem to matter very much.</p>\n<p>\u201cLast one?\u201d Crowley said, nodding at the remaining oyster on the platter.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Aziraphale demurred, having already had more than his fair share.</p>\n<p>Crowley picked up the oyster, and lifted it to Aziraphale\u2019s lips, and Aziraphale couldn\u2019t look away from his yellow-slitted eyes as he swallowed the oyster down.</p>\n<p>Crowley didn\u2019t look away, either, and oh, was this temptation?</p>\n<p>No wonder humans were so easily swayed. But Aziraphale was made of sterner stuff\u2014specifically, made of love, and he had faith his side would prevail.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Crowley finally knew Aziraphale\u2019s name, but he rarely used it.</p>\n<p>He preferred, instead, to call him <i>angel</i>. He said it left and right, peppering conversations with it, putting the final punctuation on a point he was making in an argument that wasn\u2019t really an argument, but a meandering dance they both knew the steps to and disregarded at will.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, for someone who is such a proponent of fitting in, you seem happy enough to announce what I am to the world,\u201d Aziraphale groused once.</p>\n<p>Crowley lifted an eyebrow. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Aziraphale said, suddenly less certain.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I call you <i>angel</i>, that\u2019s not what humans hear,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley leaned close, so that his lips were almost at Aziraphale\u2019s ear. \u201cThey hear <i>honey</i>. <i>Darling</i>. <i>Sssweetheart</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale went very, very still, and he felt like his body\u2019s traitorous heart might beat out of his chest. \u201cOh,\u201d he managed, finally. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Crowley asked, and it was his turn to sound uncertain.</p>\n<p>\u201cHumans could do with hearing more expressions of love,\u201d Aziraphale said firmly, and then wetted his lips as he turned to look Crowley in the eye. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not your intention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley stared at him. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just\u2014keep on, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d Aziraphale said, when he really meant, <i>call me that always, mean it like the humans hear it</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything is less conspicuous than your name, angel,\u201d Crowley said, rolling his eyes, but it sounded just the slightest bit fond, and Aziraphale could and would content himself with that.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Crowley hated it when Aziraphale mentioned it, but he could be really kind. Aziraphale would be tempted to assign it to Crowley\u2019s former ethereal nature, except he didn\u2019t encounter much kindness when he reported to the head office, if he was being scrupulously honest.</p>\n<p>He crumpled the reprimand from Gabriel for too many frivolous miracles, and honestly\u2014what counted as frivolous, anyway?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to sound like him,\u201d he said out loud to himself.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t seen Crowley in a month or so\u2014he\u2019d been rather occupied with opening up a bookshop, an endeavor to which Crowley had been politely skeptical.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me see if I have the right of it,\u201d he said, during the intermission of a rather bawdy opera. \u201cYou want to\u2014engage in commerce?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeavens no,\u201d Aziraphale said immediately. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s what a bookshop is, don\u2019t you? A place where people go to buy books?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I know what a bookshop is,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you do, in point of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley made a face at him. \u201cWhat I\u2019m getting at is\u2014you want to put all your books in one place and then\u2014\u201d he walked his fingers up Aziraphale\u2019s arm\u2014 \u201clet people <i>touch</i> them and take them home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop making it sound so tawdry. It\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d He nodded to himself decisively. \u201cTo share knowledge and literature with humans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking you\u2019ll sell, what, one book a month?\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale couldn\u2019t help his expression of horror, and Crowley <i>laughed</i>, long and low.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, angel,\u201d he said, wiping a faux tear from his eye. \u201cTell you what, if I find anything worthwhile on my trip, I\u2019ll bring it back so you can put it in your new shop and let the humans get their grubby fingers all over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d Aziraphale bristled, but allowed Crowley to fetch him another glass of wine.</p>\n<p>But it had been nearly a month since the opera, and not a word from Crowley. He hadn\u2019t said where he was going, but then they hardly lived in each other\u2019s pockets. It was a very fine line to walk: abiding by the Arrangement while not being discovered by either head office, and seeing Crowley just as much as he wanted. Which, he admitted to himself, was quite a lot\u2014things made him think of Crowley now, and he thought wistfully of some crepes they\u2019d shared in Paris a half-century earlier.</p>\n<p>And now that he\u2019d thought of it, all he wanted were crepes. And brioche. And ideally Crowley to share them with, but who knew where he was.</p>\n<p>Strangely, Crowley knew exactly where to find him when he was locked up in the Bastille after an apparently ill-advised jaunt to Paris. And over crepes afterward, Crowley pushed a volume across the table, not at all meeting Aziraphale\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale breathed. \u201cOh\u2014my <i>dear</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot another word,\u201d Crowley said, sounding pained. \u201cI just happened across it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was absolutely no way that had been the case. Aziraphale had been making inquiries for months with no luck, and he had the actual connections.</p>\n<p>Crowley really could be so terribly kind.</p>\n<p>He settled for patting Crowley\u2019s hand, in lieu of thanks, and Crowley swallowed the last of his wine in one indecorous gulp.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>They had a row about holy water, and Aziraphale stormed off afterward and then felt quite wretched about the whole affair. </p>\n<p>The thing was\u2014he\u2019d never forgotten the sense of devastating loss he felt when Crowley Fell. At least he\u2019d been able to take some comfort in the knowledge that somewhere\u2014somewhere not in Heaven\u2014Crowley still existed. </p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Crowley being gone, for good, and having only himself to blame. It was too terrible to contemplate, and how dare Crowley\u2014how dare he, when Aziraphale loved him, specifically, and not because he had to, but because he wanted to. Desperately.</p>\n<p>On his way out of the park, the heavens opened up; odd, that, given there had been absolutely clear blue skies not a moment before. He took shelter under a weeping willow and looked at the downpour in dismay; he hadn\u2019t enjoyed his first experience getting rained on, back in the Garden, and he hadn\u2019t come to like it any better.</p>\n<p>And suddenly he stopped being spattered by the raindrops that made their way through the canopy of the tree. When he looked up, he saw an umbrella held over his head, and then immediately after, who was holding the handle.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Aziraphale said sharply, and prepared himself to walk out into the rain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley said. He sounded tired, and still upset. \u201cPlease let me walk you back to the shop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so angry with you,\u201d Aziraphale said quietly, his throat tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t! You don\u2019t, or else you\u2019d never\u2014you\u2019d never ask that of me!\u201d he said, and was rather alarmed to discover he\u2019d raised his voice and that his eyes were welling up.</p>\n<p>And Crowley just looked at him, confused and so clearly hurt, and Aziraphale didn\u2019t know <i>what</i> to do, besides throw his arms around Crowley\u2019s shoulders and embrace him as tightly as he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley said, sounding strangled.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cJust\u2014stop talking for one damned minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, so slowly, Crowley\u2019s arms came up, and he clutched Aziraphale tightly, and didn\u2019t say a word.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Aziraphale pulled back, but not far, since the umbrella was only so big. He wiped at his eyes\u2014of all the days to have forgotten his handkerchief, honestly.</p>\n<p>Crowley cleared his throat and pressed something into Aziraphale\u2019s hand: a black handkerchief with what he realized were little snakes embroidered on the edge. He was about to protest, but one look at Crowley\u2019s expression\u2014sad, contrite\u2014and he obediently dabbed at his eyes.</p>\n<p>And then, without further discussion of any sort, he allowed Crowley to walk him back to Soho. At the bookshop door, he attempted to hand the handkerchief back to Crowley.</p>\n<p>Crowley instead folded one hand over Aziraphale\u2019s. \u201cKeep it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAngel, <i>please</i>,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n<p>So Aziraphale carefully folded it and tucked it in his pocket. Crowley drew in a breath, as if to say something, and instead tipped his hat to Aziraphale and strode off into the rain, not a drop daring to touch him under his black umbrella.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale really did mean to give the handkerchief back after laundering it, but somehow it never seemed the right time. The embroidered snakes were really quite sweet and they made him smile, so he just carried it in his pocket for safekeeping, and to look at, occasionally.</p>\n<p>And anyway, Crowley never asked for it back, although he did catch sight of it once. He just gave Aziraphale a tiny smile, as though he were helpless to do otherwise.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Sometime later, after a demonic miracle involving books of prophecy, and a thermos of holy water, Aziraphale bought a plant.</p>\n<p>Specifically, a black orchid he saw in passing in a florist\u2019s window. Upon closer inspection, it wasn\u2019t truly black, but so heavily pigmented that it appeared as such. It put him in mind of Crowley\u2019s scales, and without very much more thought, he popped in and purchased it. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave you raised orchids before, sir?\u201d the florist asked him doubtfully. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me,\u201d Aziraphale assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley had become somewhat obsessed with houseplants over the last decade and talked about them as though they were his very disobedient, jam-faced children. </p>\n<p>He plainly loved them. Well, loved them in a rather severe way, not unlike how the Almighty had apparently felt about humanity around Noah\u2019s time. But he must love them, or else why go to all the trouble to keep them alive?</p>\n<p>Potted plant in hand, he decided to take himself on over to Crowley\u2019s flat in Mayfair. He hadn\u2019t been often, and certainly had never turned up unannounced before. </p>\n<p>Crowley answered the door in somewhat disreputable black denim trousers and a leather jacket he had been breaking in for a good two decades. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked immediately. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour trousers have holes in them,\u201d Aziraphale said politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fashion, angel, I\u2019d get a commendation for it if anyone down below could grasp irony.\u201d Crowley braced himself in the door frame. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Aziraphale said, and thrust out the plant at him. \u201cHousewarming gift, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou know those are meant to be given when you move into a place, yeah?\u201d But he took the orchid carefully from Aziraphale, and led the way to his room with all the lovely plants. He walked around the room, pot in hand, occasionally pausing and looking contemplative.</p>\n<p>Finally, he miracled up a new plant stand, and carefully set the orchid on it. \u201cDon\u2019t let it go to your head,\u201d he said to the orchid, a bit of a hiss behind his words. \u201cI have <i>expectations</i> you\u2019d do well to meet.\u201d</p>\n<p>He touched one of the orchid\u2019s petals, just once, but oh so gently. Then he turned to Aziraphale and said, \u201cCare for a drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley came over to the bookshop later that week to complain about the orchid, which he named Hamlet, on the grounds that it, too, was a maudlin wanker with a short life expectancy, if it kept this up. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s doing its best,\u201d Aziraphale said soothingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree of its leaves yellowed overnight. Much more of this and I\u2019m going to put it all the way in the back,\u201d he said, in the manner that some might threaten to send their child to boarding school.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the last Aziraphale heard about it. In fact, Crowley seemed to come over to the shop on a regular basis to rail about the orchid\u2019s many short-comings.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remember the orchid craze in the 1800\u2019s?\u201d Crowley asked one afternoon from his sprawl on the backroom sofa, after impugning Hamlet\u2019s mild tendencies in the direction of root rot. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale was sitting at his desk, sipping cocoa and inspecting a book he\u2019d recently acquired. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot so easy to transport in those days. People went mad for them\u2014tripped the old collecting impulse, apparently.\u201d Crowley was silent for a beat, but Aziraphale could just hear his wicked smile behind him. \u201cNot that you would know anything about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale sniffed in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll that coveting, thievery\u2014good times,\u201d Crowley said with an air of nostalgia. And then, moments later, he said, \u201cWhy did you buy it, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just thought\u2014I thought you might like it, that\u2019s all,\u201d Aziraphale said softly.</p>\n<p>He heard Crowley get up behind him. \u201cNo hidden messages in the language of flowers, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>It honestly hadn\u2019t crossed Aziraphale\u2019s mind, but now that Crowley mentioned it\u2014well. He felt his face warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see it and I think of you,\u201d Crowley said, voice low, one cool hand coming to rest on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFussy, troublesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale made a face.</p>\n<p>And then Crowley touched his cheek gently, as gently as he\u2019d touched the orchid\u2019s petals, as gently as he\u2019d touched Aziraphale\u2019s face an eternity ago. \u201cWorth it,\u201d he said, and Aziraphale\u2019s heart clenched.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale drew in one unsteady breath. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be keeping it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever in question, angel,\u201d Crowley said, and the moment lingered between them, soft and sweet and actually perfect.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>After the Apocalypse that wasn\u2019t, after they switched bodies and switched back again, the Bentley was waiting for them after they dined at the Ritz.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello again, darling,\u201d Crowley crooned at the car, smoothing a hand over the bonnet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems all in one piece,\u201d Aziraphale said as he got in. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust as it was,\u201d Crowley said, and if Aziraphale hadn\u2019t been there, he suspected Crowley would be whispering more sweet nothings to his car. As it was, he stroked the steering wheel before turning the car in the direction of Soho. </p>\n<p>The ride back was quiet by mutual, unspoken agreement, as they watched the world around them pass by, safe and sound. </p>\n<p>\u201cHere you are, angel,\u201d Crowley said, pulling up to the bookstore and stopping the engine. \u201cBooks are all there. Maybe with an addition or two,\u201d he said, the corner of his mouth quirked up in amusement. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale stared at his bookshop, which was just as he\u2019d remembered it, and the relief he felt\u2014well, he could hardly put it into words. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you to the door,\u201d Crowley said suddenly, which was unexpected and very kind but completely unnecessary. Aziraphale opened his mouth to say as much, but one look at Crowley and he thought better of it. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said instead, and allowed Crowley to accompany him to the door. His key still turned in the lock, and though the interior was dark, he had a sense that all was as it should be. </p>\n<p>And then he looked at Crowley, who was turning away as if to leave him to it. </p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Aziraphale yelped. </p>\n<p>Crowley stopped and turned back, raising an eyebrow in question. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale mentally flailed around for words, customs that would convey what he wanted, and what came out of his mouth was, \u201cWill you call on me? Tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley lowered his sunglasses. \u201cCall on you,\u201d he repeated. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cAt your earliest convenience,\u201d he added nervously. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t keep calling cards on me anymore, angel,\u201d Crowley said, and he leaned closer. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cJust\u2014say you will, Anthony?\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time in six thousand years, he saw Crowley\u2019s cheeks go pink. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnything you want,\u201d Crowley said, his voice unsteady and achingly sincere. \u201cAnything at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Satisfied, Aziraphale went up on his toes to press a kiss to Crowley\u2019s cheek. </p>\n<p>Crowley actually touched his face where Aziraphale has kissed him, as though he could hardly believe it. </p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Aziraphale prompted. </p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Crowley agreed, in something of a croak. \u201cEarliest convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d Aziraphale said, probably too eager by far and not caring one bit. </p>\n<p>Crowley settled his sunglasses back into place, and backed up a few steps before turning and walking back to his car as though nothing at all out of the ordinary had occurred. </p>\n<p>The illusion was abruptly broken by Crowley exultantly pumping his fist once in the air before climbing into the Bentley. </p>\n<p>Aziraphale smiled helplessly and watched him drive off. Crowley would call tomorrow, and who knew\u2014perhaps they\u2019d go on that picnic. Perhaps they\u2019d stroll through a park, hand in hand. The future brimmed with possibilities, and Aziraphale intended for them to make the most of it. </p>\n<p>They had world enough, and time, after all.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>"
