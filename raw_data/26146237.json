  "text": "<p>\n<span>According to Dante and a lot of Christians there are nine circles of hell: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter Parker was pretty sure he had now ended up in the secret tenth circle of hell, the one created specifically for him: <em>embarrassment</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because what other possible explanation would there be for his terminal case of foot in the mouth disease? What other way to excuse the fact that he always ended up saying the wrong thing at the wrong time?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Why </span>\n</em>\n<span>else would he be going on a school trip to Stark Tower?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As the school bus finally stopped in one of the parking lot behind the tower, Peter couldn\u2019t help the groan that escaped him. He wondered, distractedly, if calling in sick right now would help him or further ruin him, since May was at work and his other contact in case of sickness or danger was Tony himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He nearly tripped down the stairs when Flash knocked into him as they stepped off the bus, an ugly sneer on his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Parker, how does it feel knowing that your lie is about to catch up with you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ned, bless his heart, immediately jumped to defend him. \u201cPeter is not lying!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you </span>\n<em>\n<span>actually </span>\n</em>\n<span>believe that Parker interns here with Tony Stark himself. Cause if you do, you\u2019re more pathetic than he is.\u201d Flash turned his eye on Peter once more. \u201cEveryone knows that Mr Stark does </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>do interns. At least you could have lied and said Ms Potts. She at least </span>\n<em>\n<span>does </span>\n</em>\n<span>have an intern.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter knew he was talking about Harley and couldn\u2019t help grimacing at the thought of - his step brother? fake brother? Neither of them were Tony\u2019s kids, not really, but at the same time they </span>\n<em>\n<span>kind </span>\n</em>\n<span>of were - the other. Don\u2019t misunderstand him, Peter absolutely adored Harley. It was nice having another teenager that understood him, could keep up with him in terms of science, knew his secret, liked Tony as much as he did and spoke his language.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But it was actually Harley\u2019s fault that they were there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Stark Tower had very few schools they invited to visit every year, and Midtown High was not popular </span>\n<span>enough </span>\n<span>to have been selected. But as Pepper\u2019s secretary/PA/intern, Harley had a lot of freedom and decisions he was able to make for the company, and this was one of those.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Peter had found out and sub-sequentially chased him around and threatened to web him to the ceiling, Harley had told him that he had done it for Peter, to give him a chance to show up all the annoying bullies in his school by showing how a \u2018nerd\u2019 was actually cooler than all of them together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And that was sweet, of course. But </span>\n<em>\n<span>still</span>\n</em>\n<span>! Peter would have to walk around his second home with his classmates and risk being embarrassed by the other residents who all loved him and acted like he was their shared little brother. Hadn\u2019t he suffered enough?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>On top of that, if Flash was stupid enough to act up in Tony\u2019s own home under FRIDAY\u2019s watchful gaze, Peter worried for his life. He was man enough to admit that he was everyone\u2019s favourite and both the SI employees and the few Avengers who might be around would </span>\n<em>\n<span>kill </span>\n</em>\n<span>for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stopped once inside the tower and Peter decided to hang back a little, hoping the gaggle of other student around could hide him from where Ms \u2018call-me-Noel\u2019 Stevenson and Mr. \u2018call-me-Theo\u2019 Reunald were manning the security desk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello Midtown High!\u201d called a woman at the very front of the crowd, standing next to their teachers. Thankfully for Peter, it wasn\u2019t anyone he recognised. \u201cMy name is Elena Spike, and today I will be your guide as we go through Stark Tower.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am sure your teachers have already given you, along with the NDAs you\u2019ve signed, a packet containing what you will be doing throughout the day, but to rehash. The morning will be divided between going through the lower level facilities. You will receive small explanations behind everything Stark Industries works with and have a chance to speak and question our various sectors: Legal, Communications, Security, PR and some other sub sectors. Then the CEO, Miss Virginia \u2018Pepper\u2019 Potts will speak to you guys, and talk about her own experience going from an intern, to working in Legal, becoming Dr Stark\u2019s PA and then CEO.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAfter that you will be left for lunch for an hour, before going to the two sectors I\u2019m sure most of you are interested in: the science labs and then R&amp;D. You will spend a while there with the others before finally going into a free lab and conducting an experiment lead by our senior staff.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mutters of excitement rose around him and Peter sighed. He was curious though, that Aminah - he assumed it was her, she was the other senior staff aside from Tony -\u00a0 had agreed to do an experiment with a bunch of teenagers. She liked him well enough, but that was mostly because he came with a stamp of approval from Tony and did his more\u2026 ambitious experiments, in <strike>Tony's</strike> his own lab, which meant she wasn\u2019t liable for anything going wrong. She wasn\u2019t a children/teenagers person.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena continued, \u201cAnd then, at the end of the day, there might be a surprise. I don\u2019t know what it is, though, as it hasn\u2019t been specified on my packet either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs you all know, the Tower is several stories high, and therefore has a system of clearance to make sure no one ends up somewhere they are not supposed to be. Badges are being provided to you now,\u201d as she spoke, their teachers started moving, handing them the different badges around, \u201cand they have your name on it. Please do not lose the badges, as they are the only thing granting you access to elevators and any doors you might need to use.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRemember you have already signed NDAs before coming here, and if you break them in any way you </span>\n<em>\n<span>will </span>\n</em>\n<span>get sued.\u201d Her smile had disappeared, a stern expression taking its place. \u201c<em>Stark Industries</em> is one of the front runners in many sectors all around the world. We take industrial espionage very seriously, and we don\u2019t want any \u2018accidents\u2019. You are here because your school has agreed that you are trustworthy and you\u2019ve agreed to be mindful of the experiments and activities you\u2019ll be seeing all around,\u201d She smiled again, showing way too many teeth. \u201cLet\u2019s try to avoid meeting Legal from the other side, okay? Any question?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh, Pepper </span>\n<em>\n<span>must </span>\n</em>\n<span>have hired.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite the slightly uncomfortable air that rose from the woman\u2019s words, one of the students - Harriet - raised her hand. \u201cWill we be able to see the Avengers around?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you all know, the Avengers Initiative has relocated to the Avengers Compound,\u201d answered Elena. \u201cWhich means that most of them reside there or at their own places. Some of them might be around for one reason or another, but I must ask you to avoid approaching them. They live stressful lives and the last thing they need is anyone crowding them or jumping them with questions. If we do run into any of them and they approach you, please be mindful and polite. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make sure?\u201d Her last question was for Mr. Harrington, who promptly nodded, sending a scathing look to the class.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite what Elena thought, the chances of the Avengers being around was, unfortunately, very high.</span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>+++</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cHey, Peter,\u201d said Tony, the week before, taking a seat at the new Cafeteria built in the Compound.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Because the Avengers were busy people - Thor was King in New Asgard, Tony and Hope were running companies, Dr. Strange was Master of the New York Sanctum, Matt was still a lawyer\u2026- it was hard finding time for everyone to hang out.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>According to Tony (and Rhodey) one of the hang ups of the previous version of the Avengers was the fact that they hadn\u2019t come together organically; first they had been forced to fight without knowing each other, then in an effort to \u2018build healthy relationships\u2019 ,they were forced into mandatory movie nights that didn\u2019t respect Tony, Rhodey and sometimes Bruce\u2019s other commitments.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Because of that, Carol had issued an invite for brunch together every Saturday morning, a date and time she had found was free for almost everyone, at one point or another. The brunches weren\u2019t mandatory, but it was one of the few times everyone was free and could, come together. Even Peter - reserve Avenger was still an Avenger! - was able to attend.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>(the success was expected: turns out that when you don\u2019t force people to come to you under pain of Disapproving Looks and pointed remarks, people end up </span>\n</em>\n<span>wanting </span>\n<em>\n<span>to come. Who knew?)</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Peter had looked up from his plate, smiling. \u201cHi, Mr Stark. What\u2019s up?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>His smile wavered at the very wide smirk on Tony\u2019s face. The fact that even him calling him Mr Stark hadn\u2019t curved his enthusiasm was suspicious. Unless\u2026</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>No, he couldn\u2019t. Right?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>His horror was apparently very apparent on his face, and Tony\u2019s grin grew, as he pulled out a paper from his suit pocket. \u201cYou forgot your field trip slip in Happy\u2019s car,\u201d he sing sang, laughing when Peter let out the most wounded of noises.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cField trip?\u201d questioned Loki, sitting down with his own plate next to Tony. \u201cYou\u2019re going to\u2026 a field?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony laughed again when Peter groaned again, \u201cPetey-Pie and his little school friends are heading to my tower next week to visit.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>The effect was immediate. The rest of the Avengers and Avenger's Friends (trademark pending) stopped in the middle of their conversations, identical looks of delight on their faces. Even Carol was straight up grinning, even if she tried to hide behind her coffee mug.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Darcy didn\u2019t even pretend. \u201cIs that so, Parker? That sounds like fun!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Peter narrowed his eyes at her, shaking a finger in her face. \u201cIt\u2019s a </span>\n</em>\n<span>Stark Industries</span>\n<em>\n<span> trip, not an Avengers trip. You\u2019re not allowed to get involved.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cSure,\u201d immediately agreed <strike>Bucky</strike> James. Then, \u201cHey, remember when you used your spider fluid to stick those magnets to my arm?\u201d he asked, innocently.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Peter hit his head on the desk again, ignoring the team\u2019s loud laughter around him.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>+++</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs there a reason our badges are different from yours? And will we be able to take this home after?\u201d asked Sarah, and Peter turned his attention back on what was going on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena smiled. \u201cOh, good question. We have a colour system for all of our badges and each colour shows a different clearance level. As an intern in Legal, my badge is blue, and I can use it any time necessary. It grants me access to every SI floor, but I cannot go past them to the residential floors, or to any other sectors floors.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour badges are grey and they are the second to lowest levels, guests and tour groups. You\u2019ll have access to the bathrooms, the elevator, the common area where you\u2019ll have your lunch, and the lower levels. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be the one opening most of the doors anyway.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThose badges activate when you scan them here,\u201d she pointed to a scanner, \u201cand will automatically deactivate when you scan them again once you leave. You can keep them, of course, but they won\u2019t work again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is the highest clearance?\u201d asked someone else.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPurple, Silver and Gold have, from what I know, access to most levels. Purple is for the Avengers,\u201d and everyone made excited noises at that, \u201cBut they aren\u2019t allowed on SI\u2019s levels or in the penthouse unless invited. Silver is for the people living in the penthouse, and they too don\u2019t have access to SI\u2019s levels. Gold is for Dr Stark, Ms Potts, and the two interns who work with them, which is total access.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd is it true that one of Dr Stark\u2019s intern is a teenage boy?\u201d asked Flash, sending Peter a mocking glare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena shrugged slightly. \u201cI work mostly under Ms Potts; Dr Stark is the head of R&amp;D, they would be able to tell you about it. Are you interested in joining the team? Because Dr Stark picks them himself, you won\u2019t be able to just hand him a resume.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>You won\u2019t be able to hand him anything</span>\n</em>\n<span>, mused Peter, rolling his eyes at the way Flash shot him a victorious look, like he had proved anything.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow, is Mr. Parker here?\u201d questioned Elena all of sudden, and Peter snapped back to attention, ignoring how everyone - including security - was looking at him in surprise.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUhm, yes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The woman found him, and shot him a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been told you can use your own badge? Mr. Keener wrote down here that it would be wasteful giving you a new one when you already have your usual.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Fucking Harley,</span>\n</em>\n<span> though Peter, ignoring his growing blush and nodding slightly. \u201cYeah, I have mine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash narrowed his eyes at him, but again Elena interrupted. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get through, guys.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She passed her badge over the reader and many jumped up when FRIDAY spoke, \u201c<em>Elena Spike, Legal, clearance level: blue. Welcome, Ms Spike</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>MJ is the first to recover, looking vaguely interested. \u201cWho\u2019s that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena smirked. \u201cFRIDAY?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Hello, Midtown High</em>,\u201d continued FRIDAY\u2019s voice. \u201c<em>My name is FRIDAY and I am an Artificial Sentience - or Artificial Intelligence - created by Dr Stark. I operate across the entire Tower, so if at any times you find yourself lost, just state my name and your query and I\u2019ll do my best to answer. I will facilitate your visit today at the best of my abilities</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>FRIDAY\u2019s voice was particularly robotic today, and Peter felt a little bad about her having to hide her humanness just because people might misunderstand or fear her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShall we continue?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At Elena\u2019s call, the rest of the students moved forward, Flash of course forcing himself to the front.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Flash Thompson, Midtown High, clearance level: grey. Welcome, Mr Thompson,</em>\u201d called out FRIDAY, and even Flash couldn\u2019t help fawn about how cool it was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0One by one everyone went through, the teachers the only ones standing at the back of the group, with the last students.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then it was Peter\u2019s turn.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Peter Parker, clearance level: gold. Hey, Peter! How are you? Would you like me to alert-</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey FRIDAY,\u201d quickly answered Peter, ignoring the shocked looks of everyone except for Ned and MJ. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. School trip, remember?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Very well. Have fun!</em>\u201d she said, her voice less robotic and much more mischievous, like she knew something he didn\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And knowing FRIDAY, she most likely did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As they separated in smaller groups to ride the elevators, he felt rough hands on him immediately. \u201cWhat the fuck, Parker? Did you hack Stark\u2019s AI? You realise how much trouble you\u2019re in-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEugene,\u201d interrupted MJ, crossing her arms together. \u201cAre you calling Dr Stark stupid and incompetent enough that a teenager can hack his AI - in his own tower, mind you - or are you finally admitting that Peter is a genius?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash sputtered, heat raising on his cheeks, and Peter sighed, freeing himself of the hands. \u201cI told you, man. I\u2019m an intern, here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The other\u2019s said something unflattering about him under his breath, but then the elevator stopped and they all climbed in, in different groups.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time they had reached the new floor and spilled out of the elevator, Peter had figured out his plan of attack. Hang at the back, keep his head down and hope for the best. To be honest, even though he had clearance for everywhere in the Tower, he rarely ever spent time anywhere that wasn\u2019t with the R&amp;D people, Tony's lab, the Avengers\u2019 floors or the Penthouse. That didn\u2019t mean, however, that most of the SI teams didn\u2019t know him already.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which meant that the moment they walked into Legal, Ms. Pyatt rounded on him immediately. \u201cOh, Parker, hey! Are you busy, or do you think you can run up and get these to Potts? I haven\u2019t seen Keener yet -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before he could reply, however, Elena intervened, laughing slightly. \u201cBlair, Mr. Parker is here on a school trip today, he\u2019s not on payroll.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The woman finally seemed to notice the rest of the students, and gave Peter a little embarrassed grin. \u201cOh god, I\u2019m sorry, Pete! I didn\u2019t even realise.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ms Pyatt,\u201d he said, blushing a little. \u201cIf it\u2019s any help, Harley isn\u2019t here today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat brat,\u201d sighed the older woman, shaking her head. \u201cSorry again!\u201d she said, quickly walking away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Elena started talking again, Flash slithered next to him again, smirking. \u201cSo that\u2019s what your \u2018great interning job\u2019 is? Getting people documents and coffee? No wonder you have all clearance,\u201d he mocked, clearly very pleased with himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter didn\u2019t deign him with an answer.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The thing was\u2026 Peter could </span>\n<em>\n<span>easily </span>\n</em>\n<span>fuck Flash\u2019s whole world. All he had to do was ask Tony to pick him up from school one day. Or show up with an Avenger in tow to an event.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But the other side of the coin would be admitting to the Avengers and his family that he was getting harassed at school, even though he had a lot more strength than everyone who attended with him. And that was just bad vibes all around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t want them to think he was being bullied and intervene. Because they would freak out, and freak out <em>bad</em>. Even though most of the New Avenger had been picked on and had had a hard time growing up - Tony and Bruce as teen geniuses, Rhodey as a black student in a white field, Carol being one of the first women in the Air Force, Stephen grew up poor, Loki was disliked by Thor\u2019s warrior friends because of his magic, Bucky grew up in the depression and was forcibly drafted in the war\u2026 the most well adjusted of them was </span>\n<em>\n<span>Vision</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Enough said\u00a0 - they would </span>\n<em>\n<span>freak </span>\n</em>\n<span>if they heard someone had looked at him wrong.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Like when Tony had told them about the fight in Germany and how Captain America had thrown a jet bridge on him. Tony had gotten an earful about dragging Peter in that fight, and Carol and Bucky had promised themselves that when the Rogues came out of their super secret hiding place cough Wakanda cough they would kick Roger\u2019s ass)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn't worth it, and at least, better it be Peter, who could take it, than someone else.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he mostly stayed at the back for the rest of the morning, paying little attention and waving whenever someone recognised him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod, I\u2019m starving,\u201d said Ned from next to him, as they left the PR floor and headed to one of the small auditoriums on the 21st floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe just have the presentation with Ms Potts now, right?\u201d questioned MJ, checking the schedule. \u201cGood. She seems really cool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh she is,\u201d admitted Peter, always a fan of praising Pepper. \u201cShe is the only one who legitimately scares me in this whole Tower. Because if Pep- Ms Potts hates you, </span>\n<em>\n<span>everyone </span>\n</em>\n<span>hates you. It\u2019s like she\u2019s the initiation test for everyone who works at a high enough level in the Tower.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The girl looked amused and disbelieving. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLegal has a shrine dedicated to her that they pray to before every case, just like R&amp;D offers a sacrifice of green smoothies and donuts to a To- Dr Stark inspired robot every time they start an experiment,\u201d he confided, grinning as her amusement grew.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis place is so weird. I see why you are so comfortable around here, now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter made to complain about the, frankly, unfounded accusation when his phone vibrated in his pocket.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pulled it out and stayed slightly back, reading the text.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup): </b>\n<span>pete pls tell me u can see this text</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup): </b>\n<span>come on</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup): </b>\n<span>come on come on</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup): </b>\n<span>come on come on come on</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>my name is peter with a b: </b>\n<span>when did you hack me and change my name</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup): </b>\n<span>peter!!!!! thank god, do me a favour</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>my name is peter with a b</b>\n<span>: no</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup):</b>\n<span>\u00a0u need to tell pep i need the documents for the japanese merger. i have everything EXCEPT tony\u2019s signature</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>my name is peter with a b</b>\n<span>: what</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>my name is peter with a b</b>\n<span>: tony signed the other day i\u2019m pretty sure</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup):</b>\n<span> i didn\u2019t get it and i have the meeting in like half an h o u r and peppers not answering g me, peter, spiderling, DUDE</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>my name is peter with a b</b>\n<span>: chill omg, i\u2019ll ask her</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>here comes dat boy (oh shit, whaddup): </b>\n<span>u\u2019re literally the loml, omg thank you. remember japan merger, document alpha gamma 124 a, b, c &amp; d!!!!!!!!!!!!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter put his phone back into his pocket and settled in the free chair behind MJ and next to Ned, and considered how to play it. Pepper\u2019s talk was going to last around an hour, and Harley clearly needed the documents before that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And as much as Harley\u2019s suffering brought nothing but joy to Peter\u2019s cold heart\u2026 he was too nice to cause potential real life trouble to the boy or Tony and Pepper\u2019s company.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he waited until Pepper walked into the room, dressed to the nines in a beautiful pressed pink suit and black louboutins, then immediately raised his hand, ignoring Elena\u2019s \u2018Can I help, Mr Parker?\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pepper, upon hearing his name from the woman, turned around, immediately smiling when she saw Peter. \u201cPeter! I didn\u2019t know your school was the one coming!\u201d She made a face. \u201cHarley?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHarley,\u201d agreed Peter, rolling his eyes and ignoring his classmates, teachers and Elena\u2019s staring. \u201cAnyway, Ms Potts-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSince when do you call me </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He grimaced. \u201cPepper. Harley just texted me about the meeting he has in like 20 minutes? For the merger? He\u2019s been trying to get a hold of you, he\u2019s missing some of the signed forms.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pepper frowned, beckoning him. \u201cTony\u2019s?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered, pulling out his phone as he approached her. \u201cBut I know for a fact Tony has already signed those, he made me scan them specifically for the meeting? He sent them down to Legal to make a record of.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The red haired woman opened her laptop, going immediately in CEO mode. \u201cHas Harley called Tony?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter nodded. \u201cYeah, but he hasn\u2019t gotten an answer either. FRIDAY says he\u2019s in the \u2018shop.\u201d When the woman\u2019s frown grew, Peter motioned to her laptop. \u201cHe made me scan them, so I should have a copy. The first lesson you taught me was make a copy, a copy of that and a copy of </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d he reminded her, smiling a little, and forcing himself to ignore their shocked audience.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pepper immediately relaxed. \u201cThank god I have you, Peter,\u201d she sighed, handing him the small computer. \u201cHave at it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter sat behind the desk, keeping his gaze focused on the task at hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>To be honest, at the beginning, his internship had not really involved any legal mumbo jumbo. It just involved helping Tony in the workshop with their suits and sometimes following him in the R&amp;D labs when the man was too busy to stay and help him one on one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Tony had started asking him for his opinions and advice on various other experiments and suddenly the rest of the R&amp;D team was following script, wanting to hear from a \u2018fresh perspective\u2019. And since he was shadowing the Head of R&amp;D and helping with patented work, soon he had forms and stuff to fill. Technically he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>Tony\u2019s PA, but he was with the man often enough that at least Pepper and Harley sent him stuff instead of sending it to Tony, and now there he was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFound it!\u201d he announced a few moments later, opening up Harley\u2019s e-mail. \u201cWould you like me to CC is to you, too?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes please,\u201d agreed Pepper, coming to look at the screen next to him. \u201cHave you checked-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd the last one-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSingle or double?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDouble, and Harl has the empty one.\u201d He finished typing a general email for Harley and cocked his head to the side. \u201cDo you want a recording, transcript or his minutes of the meeting?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pepper thought about it for a second, then shrugged. \u201cMinutes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTyped or-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, typed for sure. And then tell him to send me everything once he\u2019s finished with everything, and CC it to Pyatt in Legal, Tony, you and Murdock.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter stopped tapping, looking at the woman in confusion. \u201cMurdock? Matt?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, appearing a little amused at his question.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The brunet\u2019s confusion didn\u2019t dissipate. \u201cIs he consulting?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot officially, hasn\u2019t signed anything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter kept staring at her. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a conflict of interest? Shouldn\u2019t Legal make him sign some sort of NDA, first. I mean, I respect him immensely and I trust him with my life, but don\u2019t you want to cover your bases? Isn\u2019t it a risk you should avoid, especially if someone in his office sees it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was vaguely aware of Elena and Mr Harrington gasping at the blunt question, but he knew Pepper - and Tony - preferred people questioning them at every turn (within reason) to yes men who couldn\u2019t think for themselves.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As expected, Pepper beamed. \u201cNormally, that would be the case. But the product we\u2019re pushing for is something Murdock helped with, by testing it before. I want him to be aware of the cost, the productivity rate, the usage doses, so that he can-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGive us an honest review as a customer and someone who can be biased against us,\u201d he agreed, fingers flying over the keyboard again. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He finally sent off the e-mail, cheeks blossoming in a blush at the shocked expressions of everyone around him. He knew that - although he hadn\u2019t cornered him - Mr Harrington had doubted him about the internship, but it was still embarrassing to see how impressed his teacher was of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you, Pete, go take a seat,\u201d finally said the CEO, turning her attention to the students once more. \u201cThe behaviour you\u2019ve just seen from Peter? That is one of secrets of the trade, one of the reasons someone as young as me was able to go from \u2018the redhead in Legal\u2019 to the CEO of one of the biggest companies in the world. My name is Virginia Potts, and, on behalf of Stark Industries, I\u2019d like to welcome you again to Stark Tower.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was so </span>\n<em>\n<span>cool</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d immediately whispered Ned, once Peter was sat next to him again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Part of Peter was still a little embarrassed at the open attention, but another was proud of finally being able to show what working with Tony and Pepper had taught him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>MJ momentarily turned to him. \u201cYou were cool, Loser.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter beamed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The cafeteria in the Tower was not somewhere Peter enjoyed spending time in. At the beginning it was such a vicious attack on his senses that Peter had nearly had a panic attack when he stepped in the first time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Tony had found out, he had first apologised profusely (even though he had nothing to apologise for) and then built a frequence in the walls; it was a small humming noise that Peter could focus on when he felt his sense being attacked, and worked like a charm in keeping the nausea at bay.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still, Peter preferred eating out in the various shops around the tower, or even in one of the residential floors.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The lunches were free for everyone on the field trip, and within moments everyone was already lined up, waiting to be served.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter made to follow when a sudden voice called out his name and made his eye twitch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter, </span>\n<em>\n<span>sweetheart</span>\n</em>\n<span>!\u201d crowed James Buchanan \u201cBucky\u201d Barnes, opening the door and marching inside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter sighed, turned around and then nearly cried.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because the fearsome Winter Soldier, longest held POW, the Fist of Hydra and accomplished and untraceable assassin was walking across the cafeteria in a frilly pink apron with the words \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>the fucker in charge of feeding you fuckers</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019 neatly printed on in silver, hair in a manbun, a bunny water bottle and an iron man lunch box in his hands.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He even had the </span>\n<em>\n<span>audacity</span>\n</em>\n<span> of pretending to be embarrassed at the sight of his friend. \u201cOh, your little friends are here? How lovely!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His classmates were just staring at James in utter confusion, since the metal arm screamed Winter Soldier but the rest of the ensemble was more \u2018frazzled soccer mom\u2019.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>asshole</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d he hissed, once the man stopped in front of him with an smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my baby, don\u2019t make me come after you with soap, now!\u201d he chided. Then he handed him the bottle and the food. \u201cCome now, you forgot your lunch this morning.\u201d He turned to Ned and Sarah who were standing next to them watching in shock. \u201cYou shoulda seen him this morning! All in a rush to come school, came downstairs looking like a disgruntled little kitten-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you James, bye James!\u201d nearly shouted Peter, snatching the items from his hands and pushing himself and the man away from the line. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>James let himself be pushed, still grinning at Peter. \u201cI wanted to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter let his eyes narrow once they got to the door. \u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The fake smile dropped for a shit eating grin. \u201cI </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>wanted to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The teen sighed, pushing him out of the door and shouting \u201cPrick!\u201d, after him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAss!\u201d came the prompt reply before the door closed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then the teen dropped to his seat, cheeks red beyond measure. And when he opened the lunch box, he tried very valiantly to find </span>\n<em>\n<span>one </span>\n</em>\n<span>reason not to stab himself in the eye at the sight of almost child sized cutlery and a somewhat well assembled spiderman </span>\n<a href=\"https://ivinuvunk.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<span>bento</span>\n</a>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He ignored the chatter from his classmates (\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Was that </span>\n</em>\n<span>the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Winter Soldier?\u201d \u201cThe Winter Soldier knows Peter Parker?!\u201d \u201cHe did say he did an internship here, recall?\u201d \u201cYeah but I thought like Flash that he was faking!\u201d \u201cI told you that the driver that picks Peter up sometimes was familiar!\u201d)</span>\n</em>\n<span> grabbing some cutlery from the side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before he could return to his seat, Flash stopped in front of him, glaring daggers at Peter. \u201cHow the </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck </span>\n</em>\n<span>do you know the Winter Soldier?! Did he save you from something?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter was honestly growing tired of the man\u2019s pestering. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m Mr Stark\u2019s intern. I work with him a lot, so I see the Avengers pretty often, I even help repair their gear.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The bully scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that you might work here in Stark Tower and that Ms Potts clearly knows you, but there is no way </span>\n<em>\n<span>you </span>\n</em>\n<span>work with the Avengers. Admit it, he saved you from falling on your ass at some point and you guys became\u2026 friendly.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was fascinating, honestly, seeing a guy as smart as Flash hating the truth in front of him so much that he created a new delusion that he decided to buy into instead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d he told him, side stepping him and shrugging him off when the man tried to grab him again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re a fraud, Parker!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>MJ had found herself a seat next to Peter, and she shook her head as the brunet slipped in his own. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give up, does he?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter nodded, starting on his lunch (</span>\n<em>\n<span>What? James might be an utter ass, but he was a good damn cook</span>\n</em>\n<span>). Then he looked at her curiously. \u201cYou believed me from the beginning. Even when we weren\u2019t that close.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>MJ stabbed her salad with a shrug. \u201cI observe. I watch everyone and I see things. You might hide things, but you don\u2019t lie. Not real lies.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The boy smiled, cheeks pinking, as Ned jumped next to him with his own lunch. \u201cDude, holy shit! The Winter Soldier brought you lunch! What the hell is your life, even, Peter? That was so cool, and you two were basically bantering like friends! Are you two close? Wait, you said that the Princess that definitely </span>\n<em>\n<span>didn\u2019t </span>\n</em>\n<span>harbor him in her country before Mr Stark pushed for his pardon showed you the schematics for his arm, do you help fix it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot yet,\u201d said Peter with a sigh. \u201cBut To- Mr Stark lets me come in the workshop and he lets me help with the fixing because both James and Winter like me well enough. Well, they like Mr Stark too, but he\u2019s too much of-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The door opened again, and a very familiar scent of baked goods filled in the air.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He heard the gasps from everyone around him and immediately pointed an accusing finger at the two people walking inside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d grinned Rhodey, winking at the boy and stopping next to him. \u201cWhat a surprise seeing you here!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally, Uncle Jim?\u201d he questioned, narrowing his eyes at the man. Then he pointed at the man behind him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe <em>you</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki didn\u2019t look impressed, handing him a phone. \u201cI was on the You Tube and I lost the video I was looking at. But I wasn\u2019t logged in, so I can no longer find it. I will allow you to help me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat an honor,\u201d said Peter, then eyed the two tupperwares in Rhodey\u2019s hands distrustful. \u201cWhat\u2019s in that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy, I am so glad you asked!\u201d immediately said Rhodey, because despite what many might say, James Rhodes was a little shit and was less an enabler and more an active part in Tony\u2019s disasters. \u201cSee, I just happened to be baking-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHush, little brat. I was just baking for the Science team, but there was an accident in one of the labs - before you ask, yes, Goff - and it\u2019s being decontaminated. Which means I have loads of cookies and no one to give it to, so I thought, \u2018Hey, Peter is coming here with his class isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love some </span>\n<em>\n<span>War Machine </span>\n</em>\n<span>cookies made my moi!\u2019.\u201d He turned to the class. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Yes!\u201d \u201cHoly shit, War Machine looked at me!\u201d \u201cThank you so much, Colonel Rhodes!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man turned his smug grin back on Peter, and the teen just rolled his eyes. He couldn\u2019t prove it, but he really wouldn\u2019t put it past his uncle to be the reason of the botched experiment - even though Tom Goff had an history of blowing shit up </span>\n<em>\n<span>all the time</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki took one of tupperwares from Rhodey\u2019s hands and sat down next to Ned, who promptly squealed in shock. The green eyed mage quirked an amused eyebrow. \u201cWell, hello, Midgard child.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend, Ned,\u201d explained Peter, trying to find the video Loki had \u2018lost\u2019. \u201cAnd this is MJ.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki\u2019s eyes turned immediately on MJ. \u201cOh, </span>\n<em>\n<span>this </span>\n</em>\n<span>is MJ? Hello, MJ and Ned.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter didn\u2019t look up from the phone but still kicked at Loki\u2019s shin, hard. To his credit, Loki\u2019s face didn\u2019t even change, even though Peter packed a kick that was more painful than most humans.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>MJ turned to Loki, tilting her head to the side. \u201cPeter speaks of me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The brunet kicked Loki again, and the god just shrugged. \u201cMostly to Anthony. We are interested in weird and bizzare, and you, according to the dear one, are plenty weird and bizzare.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Peter expected MJ to be annoyed by the words, he was disappointed. The girl actually blushed a little, sending Peter a smile. \u201cOh? </span>\n<em>\n<span>Thank </span>\n</em>\n<span>you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter gave her a little smile back. \u201cUh\u2026 yeah. Eh. No problem.\u201d When Loki\u2019s grin widened, he clicked the link he found and handed the phone back to the man. \u201cHere\u2019s your video. Now you can go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe youth, nowadays,\u201d he sniffed, even as he stood up. Rhodey was waving at the rest of the student, an empty tupperwear in his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter glared at his sort-of-uncle. \u201cWhat about me? Where are my cookies?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki snapped his fingers together, and even MJ was impressed when three cookies appeared in front of the trio. Then of course he had to ruin it by pressing a kiss on Peter\u2019s head. \u201cSee you later, dear one. And thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d agreed Rhodey, smacking a kiss on the boy\u2019s forehead when he was distracted, and laughing at his disgruntled expression. \u201cBye bye, Peanut!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI hate you!\u201d he shouted back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Neither of them turned around, Rhodey calling out a, \u201cHowever shall I go on now?\u201d, as they left.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unappeased, Peter blocked out his classmates again, biting into the cookie.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At least it was good.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After lunch, they went around some of the Science labs, but it was quicker than before.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll see Bruce Banner?\u201d asked Ned, elbowing Peter in the stomach. \u201cHe\u2019s like\u2026 one of my heroes, I really want to meet him one day.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His best friend shrugged. \u201cI have honestly 0 idea. He has labs here, but he mostly spends time at the Avenger\u2019s Compound, because it\u2019s easier for Thor to go to the Compound than it is to come here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The whole Thor/Bruce situation was particularly amusing to Peter. In a way, it made sense: the two strongest Avengers - or, better, two of the strongest Avengers. But it also, really didn\u2019t; Bruce was a man of piece and quiet, whereas Thor had grown up with </span>\n<em>\n<span>Loki. </span>\n</em>\n<span>In </span>\n<em>\n<span>Asgard</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He </span>\n<em>\n<span>thrived </span>\n</em>\n<span>in chaos, and screaming and fighting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter wondered if Hulk liked Thor in the way Bruce liked Thor. Because Hulk was, technically, Bruce Banner\u2019s alter ego, right? How did people with Dissociative Identity Disorder deal with relationships? Was it ethical to date only one part of someone? And what about people with personalities that were younger?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d called Elena, clapping her hands to get their attention. \u201cUnfortunately we cannot access the chemistry lab because of an accident,\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Tom</span>\n</em>\n<span>, \u201cso we will head to the R&amp;D main lab instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know I\u2019ve already told you guys to keep your phones to yourselves and all, but I must remind you yet again. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Stark Industries </span>\n</em>\n<span>is, nowadays known for how advanced our technologies are. So, when you enter this lab, you must abide by the rules of the room. Hands to yourself, ask before touching anything, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>listen </span>\n</em>\n<span>to the interns and scientists around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEveryone knows that R&amp;D are Dr Stark\u2019s favourite children,\u201d the students laughed a little at the joke that wasn't quite a joke. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve learned a lot from him; this means that they don\u2019t give second chances, if you\u2019re distracting or creating trouble you </span>\n<em>\n<span>will be </span>\n</em>\n<span>kicked out. They have an absolute 0 tolerance attitude in there.\u201d When she saw the worried expression on the students - and even Mr Harrington\u2019s - faces, she softened her tone a little. \u201cAs long as you listen to what\u2019s being said, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even Flash was quiet as they all walked inside the third main lab where five other scientists were already present. The main lab was where most of the SI stuff took place. Anything pertaining the Avengers - both before and after Accords - took place in Tony\u2019s lab. The man had actually cleared out a lab for Peter, but he still felt somewhat uncomfortable working alone, and since he didn\u2019t look annoyed at Peter working in the room with him more often than not, Peter spent most of his time there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That didn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t spend time with the R&amp;D people, though.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter!\u201d called out a tall hispanic man, grinning brightly when he spotted him at the back of the group. \u201cThe hell you doing here? Tony lending you to us for the day?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The teen ignored the loud whispers of \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>even they know Peter\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> and \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>oh my god, Tony Stark actually works with Peter?!\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> and smiled, a little uncomfortable. \u201cNo, Leo, this is my class. School trip?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A red headed girl next to him blinked at Peter. \u201cHoly shit, I forgot you\u2019re a kid. Hey, you didn\u2019t hear anything about the BEDG (Bachelor Extraordinaire Drinking Game), right? You didin\u2019t sign up?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now it was Peter staring at them suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s the BEDG?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? Uh? Who said that?\u201d questioned the red head immediately, fluttering her lashes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena cleared her throat a little, and all scientist turned their attention back on the rest of the students - who were watching Peter like he was someone they had never seen before.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A tall Muslim woman stood taller, smiling slightly uncomfortably at the students. \u201cWell, hello Midtown High?\u201d At the teacher\u2019s nod, she continued. \u201cMy name is Dr Aminah Towfeek and I\u2019m one of the lead scientists in my division. I have worked in the company for about 6 years now, straight out of university.\u201d The students looked at her in awe, and her smile became less rigid. \u201cI know, when I got the a call like a week after filling my application I genuinely thought I was being punked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyway, these are my collagues: Dr Leo Andes, who had been working here for a whooping 13 years - one of the few to survive the purge of \u201808,\u201d the man who had been talking to Peter earlier waved, \u201cMs Jen Rolland, a 3 years intern who\u2019s working on her doctorate and has a spot open right here when she graduates,\u201d the red headed girl waved, smiling brightly, \u201cMr Olliver McVeith, 7 years working here, has been my mentor since I started and who I wouldn\u2019t have survived without,\u201d a short man with glasses and dark hair snorted at her presentation, \u201cand Dr Amanda Ngozie, only been here for 2 years but has been rising to the top at an amazing rate.\u201d, the last scientist, a dark skinned woman grinned, sending Aminah a kiss.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aminah sent a kiss back and turned her attention back towards the students. \u201cThe lead and senior scientists all have their own labs and workshop spaces; however, the main labs are places where teams can come and work together on projects without having to go from lab to lab.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then she continued with an history of the R&amp;D department, letting Leo take over the parts she wasn\u2019t sure about, and allowing the rest to chime in when they saw fit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou will have a chance to ask questions but,\u201d and here Aminah smiled, a sinister smile that had Peter narrowing her eyes at her in suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s time we tell you a few rules about being in the lab. And, here at R&amp;D, we have a little tradition-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter groaned, slapping a hand over his face loudly enough that some of the students turned to frown at him. Aminah, who had caught his dismay, smiled like a shark. \u201cOh, I see our little one has figured out what\u2019s going on. Great! You see, our tradition is, the last person who has been hired is always in charge of explaining the rules to our new hires. And since Amanda was the one who explained to Mini Boss over there\u2026\u201d she trailed off, and turned to Mr Harrington. \u201cWould that be all right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The teacher - treason and betrayal - immediately nodded, something akin pride on his face as he regarded Peter again. \u201cSure! Go ahead, Peter!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was mostly the thought of making one of his favourite teachers proud - even though they didn\u2019t believe him fully, at the beginning - that finally convinced Peter to push one feet after the other forward until he was standing between Leo and Aminah.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His classmates were looking at him with wide eyes, and Peter breathed a couple of times to settle his nerves before starting to talk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once he started, it was easy. The rules - aptly named \u2018<em>R</em></span>\n<em>\n<span>espectable Conduct To Avoid The Ire Of Legal and PR\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> - were stuck and laminated on the walls of every lab, and after hearing them shouted at one scientist or another during the 13 months he had been interning with Mr Stark, they were unforgettable.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But when he finished, Amanda was grinning at him, a dangerous twinkle in her eyes (</span>\n<em>\n<span>Tony could say that scientists were all very eccentric by nature all he wanted, but he had a terrible habit of getting people who were batshit crazy working with him</span>\n</em>\n<span>).\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cActually, there is one new rule,\u201d she continued, winking at him, \u201cthat we added </span>\n<em>\n<span>specifically </span>\n</em>\n<span>because of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash jumped on it like a shark smelling blood. \u201cPeter caused trouble, uh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The woman, missing the sarcasm, snorted. \u201cOf course! If he didn\u2019t cause trouble, he couldn\u2019t be here! After all, all of our rules are literally responses to someone, pardon my language, fucking up.\u201d Flash\u2019s mouth turned like he tasted something bitter, and Amanda continued, oblivious. \u201cThe rule is: </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Never bring something from another lab without telling </span>\n</em>\n<b>\n<em>everyone </em>\n</b>\n<em>\n<span>that you\u2019ve done so and explaining to them what you brought</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh!\u201d gasped Peter, flushing a little, while Amanda snorted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, \u2018oh\u2019,\u201d she turned back to the curios high schoolers. \u201cYou see, about three months ago, our dear Peter here, was working with Dr Stark and Spiderman on Spiderman\u2019s webshooters,\u201d she explained, ignoring the gasps at the name dropping. \u201cAnd then there was a whole thing involving squid ink and a cleaning bot - but anyway, Peter came to borrow one of our old schematics to cross reference with his own work. Unbeknown to us, Peter had brought with him the web fluid he was still working with and just dropped it on the table and promptly forgot about it for like an hour.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe thing about us scientists, especially here in R&amp;D, is that we have absolutely 0 self preservation instincts. If we see something new and weird in the lab, we </span>\n<em>\n<span>will </span>\n</em>\n<span>poke and touch until it goes <em>boom</em>. If you put a red button with a big \u2018do not touch\u2019 sign on it but no explanation as to what is gonna happen if you </span>\n<em>\n<span>do </span>\n</em>\n<span>touch it in here\u2026 we\u2019re gonna touch it.\u201d Aminah, Leo, Oliver and Jen all nodded very solemnly, like she was quoting the bible or something. \u201cWhich meant that, when Peter realised he had forgotten the web fluid almost an hour later and showed up? It was </span>\n<em>\n<span>everywhere</span>\n</em>\n<span>. My hands were stuck together, Aminah\u2019s head scarf was stuck on the wall, Leo was basically one with his table, some scientists that aren\u2019t here today were stuck together\u2026 it was a mess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter, who had been embarrassed at the beginning, managed a small smirk. \u201cI have blackmail material to last a lifetime,\u201d he joked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Amanda smirked back. \u201cHey, FRIDAY, do you remember Fire Eyebrowgate -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNevermind, I love you Amanda and you\u2019re the best person ever and I would </span>\n<em>\n<span>never </span>\n</em>\n<span>blackmail you!\u201d he rushed to say, smacking a hand on the older girl\u2019s mouth. See? Scientists were all deranged and </span>\n<em>\n<span>evil</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow that we are done with the rules,\u201d said Jen, shifting the attention onto herself. \u201cI\u2019m sure you must be wondering what we\u2019re gonna be doing here. We will be diving in six different groups, and each group will be working on an easy and already started project. According to your teacher you\u2019re all the best of the best, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to breeze through it, especially since you\u2019re Peter\u2019s classmates.\u201d The compliment made the teen blush again - seriously, he was starting to worry that his cheeks were never going to return their normal colour again - and he kept his eyes on his shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly 24 students here today, right? Now, each of you grab a table.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>MJ, Ned and him immediately grabbed one of the tables, Ned and Peter high fiving at the opportunity to work together. Then promptly grimacing when Flash decided to sit next to them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>MJ gave him a look and shook her head, while Ned glared. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash ignored him, his attention on Peter. \u201cFine. You have an Internship at <em>Stark Industries</em>. We get it. That doesn\u2019t make you special, Penis, nor does it make you smarter than me. You\u2019re just-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn front of you,\u201d said Aminah, and everyone\u2019s attention was on her again. \u201cIs the description of the experiment you\u2019ll be conducting. Each of us will work with one group, but the experiment will all be you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mr Harrington frowned, checking the tables. \u201cUh, sorry Doctor Towfeek, but there are six tables and five of you. How will you -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, am I late?\u201d drawled a voice, and Peter found himself rolling his eyes even as everyone around him gasped and shrieked in shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Black three piece suit, blood red tie, orange tinted sunglasses and shoes that costed probably as much as the bus that drove them there, Tony Fucking Stark swaggered inside the lab.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even though he had known him for about 13 months, even Peter was aware that the Tony Stark Post Afghanistan but Pre Avengers was a very different man from the Tony Stark Post Avengers - aka the Tony Stark he met.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It had taken a while for him to finally meet Tony Fucking Stark. The Tony Stark who hacked governments in court and successfully privatised world peace had returned in stages after the Accords were ratified and fixed up, and it took a while for people to realise he was back. It took him kicking Thaddeus \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019 Ross in prison and basically taking over the Accords discussion for people to see him and be beside themselves with joy and happiness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The reaction was surprising to no one except Tony himself. It took Christine Evenheart making a piece in which she said that finally Tony had \u2018stopped being a doormat and cleaning after people who thought themselves too good to explain themselves to the media and the world\u2019 for him to realise that Tony Fucking Stark was not another way of saying \u2018Merchant of Death\u2019; and so, he had embraced it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>However, Tony Fucking Stark had one terrible flaw.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was a dramatic bitch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He stopped in the middle of the room and then pulled off his sunglasses, eyeing the classroom with a single raised brow. \u201cThere are a lot of children, here, Aminah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The lead scientist rolled her eyes a little, but played along. \u201cSchool trip. Midtown High.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony smiled at Aminah as Mr Harrington moved forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Dr Stark. I\u2019m Mr Harrington, and I wanted to thank-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you\u2019re Mr Harrington!\u201d stopped him Tony, smiling and extending his hand. \u201cPeter told me you\u2019re one of the reasons why he loves science and robotics so much. You \u2018inspired\u2019 him, or something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The teacher looked like those words were going to make him cry, and the brunet swiftly let go of his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony looked around again until he found Peter - who was half hidden under the table, desperately whispering at FRIDAY to open fire because Tony was a </span>\n<em>\n<span>threat</span>\n</em>\n<span> to Peter - and smirked. \u201cOh, I see. It\u2019s Peter\u2019s People and his Tiny Friends. I guess I\u2019ll go help them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter could hear Betty and other students complaining about how </span>\n<em>\n<span>lucky </span>\n</em>\n<span>Peter was, and wanted more than anything to switch with her. But he knew Tony would simply follow him to the other group and that wasn\u2019t worth the humiliation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello, Pete-Pie. Whatcha making?\u201d asked Tony, dropping on the seat next to him and patting his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA light tracking bot,\u201d immediately answered Flash, staring at the man with wide eyes. \u201cHello, Mr Dr Stark sir, my name is-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s boring,\u201d cut him off Tony, barely sparing a glance at Flash\u2019s hand, too busy watching the schematics. He put down his Starkphone and pulled up a projection, \u201cLet\u2019s do something fun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony no,\u201d immediately said Peter, taking the phone from the man and ignoring Flash and Ned\u2019s gasps. \u201cWhenever you say that something explodes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s eyes were twinkling with the same mischief Amanda\u2019s were earlier. \u201cExactly, what\u2019s more fun than something going boom?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHaving eyebrows,\u201d answered Peter, very seriously. Fire Eyebrowgate was still a touchy subject. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do the light bot thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The older man pouted, crossing his arms together. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun, kid. I was going to teach you how to detonate a bomb with nothing but a pencil-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll call Pepper,\u201d threatened the boy, and immediately Tony glared at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHarley would indulge me,\u201d he grumbled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHarley is a sociopath,\u201d counter-argued Peter, a raised brow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe true mark of a scientist,\u201d added MJ, already working on the robot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cOh I like you. Are you MJ? Please be MJ.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The girl glanced at Peter, then nodded. \u201cYeah. Nice to meet you, Dr Stark.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Fl-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure, MJ,\u201d answered Tony, smiling and pointedly ignoring the \u2018subtle\u2019 nudges Peter was giving him. \u201cHey, did you know that once Peter-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI changed my mind, let\u2019s do whatever you wanted to do, Mr Stark! This is so boring!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The <em>sociopath</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>An hour and three small scale explosions later - Jen\u2019s group had managed to explode a water based robot, which ??? - Tony and Elena were guiding the class outside again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even though he had joked about making them defuse a bomb, Tony had ended up making them work on one of the various prosthetic projects he had going on. It was something simple, connecting fingers to the palm and making sure the could still move after being connected, and it shouldn\u2019t have exploded; but Flash had taken it upon himself to improve the finger he was working on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>See, the thing with Flash was that he was smart. He was very smart, easily top 5 in their class and top 10 in the school; but most of the time his competitiveness won over any intelligence and common sense he had.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wanted to prove that he could improve the fingers so bad that he forgot that there were </span>\n<em>\n<span>four other fingers </span>\n</em>\n<span>that the others were working on. Result? When all fingers were attached and the device was turned on for a test, the connection between that finger and the rest of the hand got corrupted, making it explode.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony hadn\u2019t been too upset by it, at least.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I know what you were trying to do, but. Improving stuff has to be done during theory or during early testing; you can\u2019t improve something without telling other people what you\u2019re doing because then you end up with one good thing trying to work in a subpar environment, and then, usually, the good thing crashes and gets ruined more easily. Remember that, all right?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash had looked like he had been given a gold bar or some candy, and had beamed, immensely happy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter had been happy for him, thinking that now, with those words in his heart, Flash would turn a new leaf and become some sort of new person.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course that wasn\u2019t the case.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee, Parker?\u201d whispered Flash, walking side by side with him. \u201cYou\u2019re not special or anything, you\u2019re just lucky. But now that Mr Stark has seen that you\u2019re not the only smart kid around and that I\u2019m smarter, he\u2019s going to drop you and pick me instead. Everyone knows Tony Stark only likes the best of the best.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It stung a little, even though Peter knew better. \u201cYou do realise that you improving that finger meant you </span>\n<em>\n<span>failed </span>\n</em>\n<span>the experiment?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The other teen bristled, glaring. \u201cHe gave me feedback </span>\n<em>\n<span>personally</span>\n</em>\n<span>. All he did was mock you; he didn\u2019t even check what </span>\n<em>\n<span>you </span>\n</em>\n<span>were doing, instead he kept his attention on me the most!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter raised a patented Tony Stark (trademark pending) level eyebrow. \u201cYou do realise that him having to check your work over and over is\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> a good thing? It means that you need more attention than everyone else and -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before he could even finish his sentence, Peter tripped forward, a hard shove sending him on the floor, head hitting the cool tiles of the hallway, </span>\n<em>\n<span>hard</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh shit, Peter!\u201d called Ned, while the teen grimaced in pain.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Enhancing, he had learned, didn\u2019t mean pain didn\u2019t hurt. It meant pain stopped earlier, but hurt still hurt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter!\u201d came Tony\u2019s voice, and almost immediately he felt the older man kneeling beside him and helping pulling him up. \u201cKid, are you okay? What happened?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter sat back up, tongue going over his split lip. At least nothing else was broken, he thought, eyes passing over a slightly pale and nervous looking Flash before he sighed. \u201cI tripped.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s eyes were confused. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>You</span>\n</em>\n<span>? Tripped?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter, are you okay?\u201d called Mr Harrington, moving closer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s eyes met Peter\u2019s and then the older man turned to Elena. \u201cRight, everyone just follow Elena to wherever you\u2019re going next, Peter and I will catch up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once everyone was gone, Tony turned his eyes to Peter. \u201cNow, what the hell happen? You don\u2019t just </span>\n<em>\n<span>trip </span>\n</em>\n<span>in the hallway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The younger boy tried to avoid his eyes, fighting to find something anything to say -</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>The student by the name Flash Thompson, put a foot in front of Peter and then shoved him down while they were walking,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d came FRIDAY\u2019s voice suddenly and holy </span>\n<em>\n<span>shit</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Peter had forgotten that FRIDAY was everywhere in the tower. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>May I add, this is after mocking him about the Internship throughout the day, calling him names and being very rude to Mini Boss. He even dared to say that he is smarter than Peter and that you, Boss, saw that today and would replace him. This speaks of a behaviour that is not unusual, since the students Ned and Michelle kept telling him to cut it out.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Absolute silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter run his tongue over his bloody lip, eyes downcast and refusing to make eye contact with Tony for about a full minute.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then the older man spoke. \u201cPeter,\u201d he said, voice very controlled that still made the teen flinch. \u201cAre you being bullied by this\u2026 Flash person?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He swallowed. \u201cNot really, I can take it and it\u2019s not-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony\u2019s tone was sharp, and Peter\u2019s mouth closed automatically. \u201cIs he harassing and/or bullying you. No excuses. Yes or no.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter wanted to lie so bad, but if there was </span>\n<em>\n<span>one </span>\n</em>\n<span>thing he had learned about Tony is that he did </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>tolerate liars. \u201c... Yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A few more beats of silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d It was the almost broken tone of voice that had Peter looking up. And immediately he wished he didn\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony looked\u2026 not sad, not disappointed. But\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>hurt</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know I\u2019m just me and I\u2019m not like your Aunt May or anything, but I would have helped you, kid. I know what it\u2019s like to be too smart for your own good and stuck around people who just </span>\n<em>\n<span>don\u2019t </span>\n</em>\n<span>understand you and decide that that\u2019s basis to judge you. I wouldn\u2019t have made fun of you or -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod, no!\u201d interrupted him Peter, putting both hands on his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t trust you or something! I haven\u2019t even told Aunt May, the only people who know are the ones who go to school with me.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, a little frustrated. \u201cIt has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me. Flash\u2026 Flash is my responsibility. I have powers, I am stronger than the people in my school. As long as Flash keeps his attention on me, he\u2019s not going after people who can\u2019t take him and-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHell, no,\u201d said Tony, eyes now alight again. Would Peter be a terrible person if he said he missed the hurt puppy look? \u201cPeter Benjamin Parker, you\u2019re not about to pull a \u2018with great powers comes great responsibility\u2019 about being </span>\n<em>\n<span>bullied</span>\n</em>\n<span>! I know you\u2019re smarter than that!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut dad-\u201d He blanched at his own words, but Tony didn\u2019t seem to notice.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018but dad\u2019 me-\u201d or maybe he did. \u201cUh. Did you. Did you just. Call me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Yes he did, Boss. Mini Boss called you \u2018dad\u2019. Shall I add this to your \u2018Peter and Harley being my children yet again\u2019 compilation?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWHAT.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony put a hand on his face. \u201cSeriously, FRI?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter stared at him with wide eyes. \u201cYou think of me and Harley as your kids?\u201d He was very much aware of the fact that Harley called Tony \u2018Mechanic\u2019, \u2018Tony\u2019 and \u2018Dad\u2019 without rule or thought, but he hadn\u2019t realised that-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony raised a brow - and here was the expression Peter had been trying to emulate earlier. \u201cYou think of me as you dad/father figure?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And well? Peter wasn\u2019t going to lie, especially if there was the littlest chance Tony would let him get away with calling him \u2018dad\u2019 sometimes. \u201cYes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony hid a smile as he stood up, pulling Peter along with him. \u201cGood. Now let\u2019s go before your teacher gets worried.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time they made it in one of the empty conference room, Peter was more or less sure Tony had forgotten about the Flash thing. He hoped.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The rest of his class was sitting in a semicircle, talking to each other, and he ignored the jealous expressions some of the students were sporting when he walked in and rushed to the spot between Ned and MJ. He could feel Tony watching him as he did so, but the billionaire quickly looked away when Peter turned back to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead he clapped his hands together - as if he hadn\u2019t had everyone\u2019s attention on him the </span>\n<em>\n<span>second </span>\n</em>\n<span>he walked into the room. \u201cAlright! The surprise Ms Spike has spoken about this morning is a special Q&amp;A session.\u201d He allowed the students to shriek in joy for a few seconds, before snapping his fingers together. \u201cJust allow me to get some coffee and then we\u2019ll get right into it. However,\u201d and his voice went a little colder and his eyes settled exactly on Flash. \u201cRemember that my AI is here. FRIDAY is </span>\n<em>\n<span>always </span>\n</em>\n<span>here, and she sees </span>\n<em>\n<span>and </span>\n</em>\n<span>hears </span>\n<em>\n<span>everything</span>\n</em>\n<span>. She doesn\u2019t like bullies.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash paled considerably at the words, and Peter felt all his hopes that Tony had forgotten about Flash going out the window.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWas it just me or did it look like Dr Stark was lowkey threatening Flash?\u201d whisper shouted Ned in his ear, as Mr Harrington approached Flash to speak to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cMr Stark has never done anything lowkey in his life,\u201d he muttered, shaking his head slightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, FRIDAY,\u201d suddenly asked one of the students. \u201cDoes being an Artificial Intelligence mean that you know everything?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>No</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d answered the AI, still sounding robotic. \u201c<em>I have an\u2026 awareness of most thing. But that awareness does not automatically mean I have an understanding of such thing. However, I am a learning AI, and Boss teaches me everything I need to know about humans and people</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d asked Betty.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter found himself answering without thinking. \u201cAsk her any mathematical question and she\u2019ll give you the right answer each time. Give her a social situation and she wouldn\u2019t be able to reason what went wrong or how to avoid it without being given several data that shows correct and proper conduct.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Exactly, Mini Boss,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d agreed FRIDAY. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>For example, I know the concept of bullying and what it means. But unless I was given examples and explanations of what bullying could include, I wouldn\u2019t be able to recognise it.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>A pause. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Thankfully, I was given such and I </span>\n</em>\n<span>am </span>\n<em>\n<span>able to recognise it.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter rolled his eyes a little, while Sebastian asked. \u201cWhy do you call Peter \u2018Mini Boss\u2019?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s because Peter is basically Tony\u2019s mini me,\u201d answered a voice, and the entire class lost their shit when members of the <strike>New</strike> Avengers walked in.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even though they were all in civilian clothing, they cut a pretty powerful image. Peter had been there as most of them joined the ranks of the Avengers and he still was awed by them at times.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They put down their chairs in a straight line opposite from the students before sitting down, Tony the last one to walk in with two chairs. He winked at the students. \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t I say we were going to have a Q&amp;A?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When the chatter and shouts and \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>oh my god, oh my god, oh my god</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d, stopped, they started.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello Midtown, my name is Major Carol Danvers, I go by Captain Marvel and I am the co-leader of the Avengers.\u201d Greeted the first woman, looking mildly surprised when the majority of the girls whistled and clapped in delight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello again,\u201d called Rhodes, smiling at Peter first and then the rest. \u201cI am Colonel James \u201cJim\u201d Rhodes. AKA War Machine - </span>\n<em>\n<span>not Iron Patriot</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d he added with a faux severe expression, earning some laughter from the students.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou may know me as famous neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange,\u201d greeted Stephen, giving them a nod. \u201cNow I also am referred to as the Sorcerer Supreme and Master of the Mystic Arts.\u201d Peter was quite sure the majority of the students did </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>know who he was, but they all pretended to anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi,\u201d called a dark haired woman. \u201cMy name is Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp and CEO of Pym. Nice to meet you.\u201d MJ actually perked up at that, looking at the woman with almost stars in her eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLoki Friggadottir.\u201d The students stared, waiting expectantly. Loki raised a brow. \u201cWhat more could you want?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBrother,\u201d chided Thor, before sitting straighter as he took in the class. \u201cGreetings, Midgard children! I am Thor Odison, King of Asgard, God of Thunder, Brother of Loki and Avenger, one of Midgard\u2019s Mightiest Heroes.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the same exact tone, \u201cAnd I am James Buchanan Barnes, Winter Soldier, reformed deadly assassin, cook extraordinaire and dastardly handsome.\u201d Thor pouted at him, but James just grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am The Vision,\u201d said the synthezoid next to him, with a polite smile. \u201cOr, as Peter insists I present myself as, first name </span>\n<em>\n<span>The</span>\n</em>\n<span>, surname <em>Vision</em>.\u201d Even MJ snorted at this, and Vision smiled at Peter, looking quite pleased with himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony just pulled off his sunglasses. \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d he said, and of course he got the loudest screams. After all there might be gods, aliens and enhanced around them but they were a science school; Tony Stark (and Bruce Banner) would always be their heroes. \u201cAs I - and Elena - have said before,\u201d he continued, once they calmed down, \u201cThis surprise was conditional and reliant on your good behaviour during this trip. And, for the most part, you guys have all behaved pretty well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter was expecting it, and was kind of aware that Tony would have told the rest of the Avengers what happened. Still, it was shocking when Loki, glared at Flash. \u201cI might have an\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>interesting </span>\n</em>\n<span>personality, but even I do not like bullies.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is most dishonourable,\u201d added Thor, also scowling at him. \u201cPicking on someone because they cannot defend themselves.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr Harrington,\u201d said Hope, turning to the teacher instead. \u201cBoth I and Tony are aware of what it\u2019s like to be unable to truly reprimand a child because of fear of what the child\u2019s powerful father\u2019s reaction, and because of that we have agreed to match, both of us, whatever amount Mr Thompson is offering the school, out of our own pockets.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have also taken the liberty of sending the school footage of Mr Thompson Jr\u2019s behaviour throughout this school trip against,\u201d Tony\u2019s eye went on Peter for a fraction of a second, \u201cone of your students. FRIDAY has a </span>\n<em>\n<span>lot </span>\n</em>\n<span>of recording of his behaviour, some behaviour that you as a teacher should have noticed, but oh well.\u201d The man cringed a little at the words, while Tony continued, implacable. \u201cOf course, I will arrange a video conference with the principal and the father, to make sure that this behaviour is properly handled. But meanwhile,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Happy walked into the room, eyes immediately going on Flash, who honestly looked about to faint.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is my head of security, who is going to escort Mr Thompson off my personal property and wait there for a guardian to come pick him up. And Mr Thompson,\u201d Flash turned his terrified gaze on Tony, who\u2019s face was now hard as stone. \u201cIt is not very heroic of me to threaten a child, so I will abstain from doing so. However. If I hear or find out that you have continued to harass Peter or any other student, I </span>\n<em>\n<span>will </span>\n</em>\n<span>make sure to have your name blacklisted from any university worth it\u2019s name and any STEM related workplace. Your father might have pull, but you don\u2019t mess with my ki- my intern or bully anyone else and get away with it, not if I can help it. Am I clear?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash nodded fear oozing from him and for a second Peter actually felt sorry for him. And even though he\u2019d </span>\n<em>\n<span>never </span>\n</em>\n<span>tell Tony that, he was glad he had been found out. He could take care of himself, and he wasn\u2019t a snitch, but knowing that Tony had his back - the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Avengers </span>\n</em>\n<span>had his back - was\u2026 nice.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The atmosphere was a little tense after Happy, Flash and Ms Mortia - she was so small, Peter had genuinely forgotten Mr Harrington wasn\u2019t the only teacher with them - walked out, but Thor smiled broadly at the students. \u201cWell? Do you have any questions for us?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Almost every hand snapped up immediately.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena selected the first student. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Mark and my question is for The Vision!\u201d The android seemed surprised at receiving the first question, and nodded. \u201cNo disrespect but uh\u2026 what are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vision smiled, seemingly amused by the question. \u201cDepends. Physically? I am a synthezoid who's body was created by a friend of Drs Stark and Banner, and my consciousness is a joint collaboration of the two doctors and Tony\u2019s previous AI. I was given life, so to speak, thanks to Thor\u2019s lightning.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention the mind stone since, NDA or not, it was not something they needed to know. \u201cSo to speak, I am a synthezoid with the same understanding of humanity that FRIDAY has, though I feel more emotion than she does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLegally? According to my birth certificate I am the son of Tony Stark.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony smirked at the reaction that got. \u201cTo be honest, Bruce should be Vision\u2019s other dad, but he ran out on us when Vision was just an infant.\u201d He patted the android\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPoor little The Vision Edwin Stark-Banner.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vision looked vaguely amused. \u201cI have a middle name?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeveral, but we don\u2019t want to go through all of them now, babyboy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Idly, Peter wondered if that meant that he could refer to Vision as his step brother in his mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena called up Betty, and the girl stood up. \u201cHi, my name is Betty. My question is for Ms Van Dyne and Ms Danvers. Before you guys came along, the original Avengers layup had 5 men and one woman. Then Dr Banner took a leave, and one woman and three men were added. But now, we are finally seeing some more women in the field, finally, though the two of you are the main female members. How does it feel knowing that you\u2019re inspiring a new generation of young women, and is dealing with so many men all the time complicated?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hope actually smiled at the question. \u201cWow, didn\u2019t expect to go right into the heavy,\u201d she laughed. \u201cBut for the first part. Before I was an Avenger, I was a chairwoman in a a big company. Like here at Stark Tower, Pym Technologies also offered plenty of school trip and I often had young women telling me that I was their role model, so I\u2019ll tell you what I told them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am what you make of me. And if what you make of me is a good person, then it\u2019s all thanks to you. Doing what\u2019s right for right\u2019s sake is the best you can do. I like that I can inspire young women everywhere to be heroes and joining STEM related subjects, but don\u2019t do it because you think I\u2019m cool. Do it because you want to do it. Do it because you think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI agree with Hope,\u201d added Carol, smiling at Betty. \u201cLooking at it now, there still are not enough women working in the Air Force, but knowing that in some way I will be helping or inspiring more into joining? It\u2019s a splendid feeling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd about the second half of the question\u2026 no, it\u2019s not that complicated. Luckily for us, the majority of these strapping men around us have grown up with strong female figures in their lives. Actually there is a whole club inside the Avengers called \u2018Daddy Issues Club\u2019,\u201d she joked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m the leader,\u201d immediately said Tony, earning a couple of laughs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Carol rolled her eyes. \u201cHonestly, when we were deciding who should be the leader of the Avengers, everyone immediately looked at me and Jim like it was the most obvious answer ever. I was expecting Tony - as an original Avenger - to step up, and he was instead the one to propose either me or Jim take the reign. The Avengers like to, as Peter says, \u2018drink their respect women juice daily\u2019.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hope grinned. \u201cBetween me, Carol and the other ladies, keeping up with these dudes and Loki is easy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Betty frowned. \u201cAnd Loki?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki shrugged. \u201cAnthony has informed me that the term here on Earth is genderfluid?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god, like me!\u201d squealed Taylor before they could stop themselves, and then blushed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki didn\u2019t look bothered by the interruption, and smiled faintly. \u201cFantastic. The Avengers are people - and gods - just like you,\u201d he said, for once no hint of sarcasm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taylor smiled brightly at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Hamza. My question is for Dr Strange. How do you, as a man of science, deal with being a sorcerer? Or did you believe in magic from the beginning?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t say a word!\u201d snapped Stephen, before Tony could even open his mouth. The inventor pouted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then he turned his attention on the student. \u201cIt was very hard. After my accident, though, I was desperate enough to try anything, and that\u2019s how I found myself in the whole wizard business.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>believe in magic and at the beginning, it looked hopeless. I had some nascent magical abilities in me, but because of my utter belief in the laws of physics and science, I was unable to reach and use them. It took my teacher stranding me on Mt. Everest for me to figure out magic itself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter mostly tuned out as each of them got serious - \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Colonel Rhodes, how does it feel to be now the only black official Avenger</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Dr Stark and Ms Van Dyne how do you juggle your work at SI and Pym Technologies with your work as an Avenger?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d and \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>To Vision, Colonel Rhodes and Dr Stark, were the Accords the only reason behind the split of the Avengers?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d - or funny - \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Mr Thor, what is your favourite food on Earth?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Mr Barnes, how do you feel about the claims that Rasputin has you beat as Russia\u2019s deadliest love machine?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d and \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Mr Loki, what is the funniest prank you\u2019ve pulled on an Avenger</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d - questions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He did notice when Tony grinned and slipped out of the room, but his attention was promptly taken when Zara asked, \u201cHave you guys read Harry Potter, and if so, what houses are you in?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki and James immediately nodded, smiling. \u201cWe read it together, yes. Me and James have a book club to better our understanding of your society. Thor doesn\u2019t join in because he can\u2019t read.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI made a point of not reading the books the growing up,\u201d explained Stephen, shrugging. \u201cAnd now that Tony does nothing but call me Potter all the time, I simply refuse to read it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Loki, \u201cI\u2019ve sorted all of you. Carol, Spiderman and Thor are Griffyndors. Rhodes, Anthony and Vision are Ravenclaws. Barnes and Hope are Hufflepuffs. Stephen and I are Slytherins.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere is a joke waiting to be said about the two witches being Slytherins,\u201d mused James, grinning when the sorcerers glared at him and said, in chorus,\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not a witch!\u201d before scowling at each other.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee? Witchcraft.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elena pointed another raised hand.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m Isaac, and my question is, among you guys, what ship is more popular? Ironstrange, Winteriron or Frostiron?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god,\u201d choked Peter, while the Avengers - except Hope and Vision - stared at Isaac uncomprehending.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPardon me?\u201d finally asked Rhodes, confused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Isaac shrugged. \u201cYou know, ship. Relation</span>\n<em>\n<span>ship</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Then he finally realised their expression. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Allow me,\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>interrupted FRIDAY, her voice sounding almost normal and giddy. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Me and Vision have actually discussed this before, as it\u2019s a phenomena we didn\u2019t fully understand. But humans, especially the newest ones, have the habit of watching a dynamic between two people, and, if they enjoy it, decide to \u2018ship\u2019 it. Which means they like/think the two people are in a relationship and write stories - called fanfiction - about said couples or throuples,\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>and here Peter died, with FRIDAY talking about fanfiction, good </span>\n<em>\n<span>god</span>\n</em>\n<span>, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Boss is one of the people with the most fanfiction written about him, and there are several pairings for him; the most popular are, currently, IronStrange, WinterIron and FrostIron. Which are the pairings of Boss and Dr Strange, Boss and Mr Barnes and Boss and Mr Loki. It is a most fascinating topic. I find myself a big fan of Boss and Mr Barnes.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god?!\u201d let out Peter, staring at one of the cameras in shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vision spoke up. \u201cActually, I find that Dr Strange and Mr Stark are very well matched, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thor was, of course, the first to get back to his senses. \u201cWell, there are many tales of my brother\u2019s prowess and conquests! I believe him and friend Tony would make the most charming of couples.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHold on!\u201d interrupted Rhodes, giving the three very pallid men a suspicious look. \u201cWhy are those three the most popular candidates as\u2026 suitors for </span>\n<em>\n<span>my little brother</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d started Isaac, \u201cMr Barnes and Dr Stark are popular because they are the \u2018Casanova of the past\u2019 and the \u2018Don Juan of the future\u2019. Plus there are so many clips online of Mr Barnes glaring and acting like a possessive boyfriend every time someone gets too close to Dr Stark.\u201d James kept staring at the ceiling, absolutely refusing to make eye contact with Rhodes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd Mr Loki, he and Dr Stark are the \u2018prince of Asgard\u2019 and the \u2018prince of Earth\u2019. They look like rich boyfriends everytime they get papped together, they wear matching clothing all the time and more than once they have been seen holding hands.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki\u2019s cheeks were a little red as he inspected his nails.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd Dr Strange and Dr Stark are magic vs science. There are so many videos of the two of them arguing/flirting on their \u2018dates\u2019, and they do so even in the few battles that people managed to record. Plus, there is that video from like 2007 of them making out at a gala-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Chorused James, Loki and Rhodes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Stephen raised both hands up. \u201c2007! We were both different people back then!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing,\u201d said Rhodey, glaring at him before scowling at the other two. \u201cIs that you\u2019re trying to pull something with my Tony? My baby brother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hope, smirking. \u201cI think Loki and Tony would be cute together, actually. He\u2019s the only one who gets to call him \u2018Anthony\u2019, and he lets him get away with hugging and touching him all the time like a sappy touch starved fool in love.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHope!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThread carefully, Van Dyne.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo way,\u201d said Carol shaking her head. \u201cBarnes and him are always calling each other bullshit like \u2018doll\u2019, \u2018snowflake\u2019, \u2018darling\u2019, \u2018honey\u2019... that\u2019s real sap shit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe calls </span>\n<em>\n<span>me </span>\n</em>\n<span>honeybear, that means </span>\n<em>\n<span>nothing</span>\n</em>\n<span>!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut no one riles him up like Dr Strange does,\u201d said Harley all of a sudden, because of course Harley would choose that moment to walk in, snickering at the looks of betrayal Loki and James sent him. \u201cAnd the cloak likes him too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe cloak likes who?\u201d questioned Tony, as he walked in with, \u201cLook here children, I\u2019ve brought my lovely Brucie-Bear!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh my god its Dr Banner!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Hulk!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m gonna pass out, it\u2019s my idol!\u201d \u201cHoly shit, Dr Robert Bruce Banner!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Thor stood up pouting and pointing a finger at Tony. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, friend Tony, you already have </span>\n<em>\n<span>three </span>\n</em>\n<span>suitors! Relinquish my lover at once?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have what?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour </span>\n<em>\n<span>what</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter just shook his head as Tony and Thor prepared to argue over Bruce who was kind of overwhelmed and enthused by the student\u2019s warm reaction to him, and James, Loki and Stephen argued about who would make a better boyfriend to Tony, while Carol tried to stop Rhodey from going after them while Hope and Vision just look around themselves, very amused by the chaos.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It could have gone worse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, who wants to hear a funny story about Peter?\u201d asked Harley, eyes sparkling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Or not.</span>\n</p>"
