  "text": "<p>1.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is five when he comes across Wei Ying for the first time. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes are drawn to his rattle drum, staring at the toy as though it is his heart\u2019s desire. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s grip on the rattle drum tightens instinctively, and he immediately chides himself for his selfishness. The rules speak of being generous, of performing acts of chivalry, of acting virtuously. Lan Zhan reflects on the rules, and offers the toy to Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, <i>gege</i>?\u201d Wei Ying asks, and his face lights up with the biggest smile. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan finds himself returning the smile. \u201cGo home,\u201d he urges gently, because it\u2019s cold, and Wei Ying does not look like he\u2019s dressed warmly enough to be out in the streets like this. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s smile dims. \u201cA-Ying sleeps here when it\u2019s cold,\u201d he tells Lan Zhan. \u201cWhen it\u2019s summer, A-Ying likes to stay by the pond!\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan frowns, looking at the alley around them. His stomach churns at the thought of leaving Wei Ying there. \u201cHas Wei Ying eaten?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Uncle and <i>dada</i> are both startled when Lan Zhan brings Wei Ying back to the inn. </p>\n<p>Dada looks as upset as Lan Zhan feels when Lan Zhan recounts Wei Ying\u2019s circumstances. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Shufu, dada</i>,\u201d Lan Zhan says, sinking to his knees, \u201cplease allow Zhan\u2019er to take Wei Ying back to Cloud Recesses.\u201d </p>\n<p>His uncle and brother exchange looks. </p>\n<p>\u201cZhan\u2019er has promised Wei Ying he can go back home with us,\u201d Lan Zhan says insistently, when they do not reply. \u201cOne should not break promises. Zhan\u2019er does not want to break his promise.\u201d </p>\n<p>Uncle\u2019s gaze softens. \u201cSon of Cangse Sanren, you say?\u201d he asks, turning to Wei Ying, who is quietly kneeling by Lan Zhan, fingers fisted tightly in Lan Zhan\u2019s robes, as if he\u2019s afraid that if he lets go, he will be chased away.</p>\n<p>Ridiculous. Lan Zhan will not let that happen.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods. \u201cYes, <i>xiansheng</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Uncle hums. </p>\n<p><i>Dada</i> smiles at Wei Ying. \u201cWere you out in the cold for very long, A-Ying?\u201d he asks, and then beckons for Wei Ying to go to him. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan watches as his brother pours out a glass of warm tea for Wei Ying, pressing it to his hands, urging him to drink and keep warm, and lets out a breath he wasn\u2019t even aware he was holding. His brother will take care of Wei Ying the same way <i>dada</i> takes care of him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying hasn\u2019t eaten all day,\u201d Lan Zhan pipes up. </p>\n<p>His uncle\u2019s breath stutters. He turns to dada. \u201cHave the kitchen prepare a few dishes,\u201d he says, before turning to Wei Ying. \u201cWhat does Wei Ying like to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes go wide at the question. \u201c<i>Xiansheng</i> does not have to trouble himself,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cA-Ying is used to not eating often. A-Ying can wait till morning, when everyone else is eating too. Or\u2026 Or\u2026if <i>xiansheng</i> has some leftover bread, A-Ying will be happy with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying should answer the question asked,\u201d Lan Zhan reminds him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d <i>dada</i> says gently, too. \u201cIt is considered rude not to answer a question when asked,\u201d he teases with a smile. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s lip wobbles. \u201cA-Ying is sorry,\u201d he says quietly. And then, softer still, \u201cA-Ying likes dumplings.\u201d</p>\n<p>His brother smiles. \u201cI will have the kitchen prepare a few varieties of dumplings for supper,\u201d he declares. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>They take Wei Ying back to Cloud Recesses when they leave.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is understandably attached to Lan Zhan, a fact which Lan Zhan finds comforting himself. Everyone else would prefer the company of his brother, who is kinder and freer with his smiles, but Wei Ying sticks to Lan Zhan\u2019s side, and is most at ease in Lan Zhan\u2019s presence. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying acts cautiously when he\u2019s in Cloud Recesses, the way he had in the inn. He tries his best not to be a bother, because he still thinks that at any moment, they could kick him out, and he will have to go back to his life on the streets. </p>\n<p>A most ridiculous notion. There are many rules that would dictate the Sect\u2019s abilities to expel someone Cloud Recesses, not to mention how unjust it would be to send a <i>child</i> back to the streets with no care for his well-being. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying is here to stay, and while both Lan Zhan and <i>dada</i> try to express this to him often, Wei Ying still tries his best not to impose. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hears a soft knock on his door one night when it\u2019s storming outside, just before <i>hai shi</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d Lan Zhan murmurs, when he opens the door to find Wei Ying standing outside, arms wrapped around himself tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Gege</i>,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cCan I- Will it be too much trouble-\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan takes him by the hand, and leads him into the <i>jingshi</i>. \u201cTake time to formulate your thoughts, speak slowly, and make your intent clear,\u201d he tells Wei Ying, repeating the words his brother had taught him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is quiet for a moment, considering Lan Zhan\u2019s words. </p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying doesn\u2019t like it when it storms,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cWhen it thunders, A-Ying is afraid. Can A-Ying stay with <i>gege</i> tonight?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s lips tip up, just slightly. Wei Ying is a fast learner. \u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the bell sounds outside, signalling that it is <i>hai shi</i>, Lan Zhan blows out the candles, and climbs into bed, making sure to leave enough space for Wei Ying to join him. </p>\n<p>He is startled when Wei Ying settles on the ground by Lan Zhan\u2019s bed instead, curling into a ball in an effort to keep warm. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying sits up. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bed is wide enough to share,\u201d he tells Wei Ying. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep on the ground.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian beams at him again, that same wide smile that had tugged at all of Lan Zhan\u2019s heartstrings the first time they met, and climbs up onto the bed. He falls asleep quickly, cuddling up close to Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is six, and he hasn\u2019t seen his mother in too long.</p>\n<p>It is customary for him and <i>dada</i> to visit Mother every full moon, but <i>dada</i> did not bring him the last moon, and Uncle had forbidden them the moon before. </p>\n<p><i>Dada</i> tells him that they will not be able to see Mother again. Lan Zhan is not stupid \u2014 he knows that he has been unruly, has been neglectful of sect rules, has disappointed the elders and Uncle and now Mother, but Lan Zhan knows he can do better, and he <i>knows</i> Mother will forgive him if <i>dada</i> and Uncle just let him apologise to her. </p>\n<p><i>Dada</i> is sad when Lan Zhan tells that to him. He, too, must be disappointed in Lan Zhan. </p>\n<p>It does not matter. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan will set things straight himself. </p>\n<p>He makes the track to Mother\u2019s gentian house himself. </p>\n<p><i>Dada</i> had admonished him not to come unannounced and unauthorised before, when Lan Zhan\u2019s feet would take him of their own volition to the edges of Mother\u2019s hut, but surely <i>dada</i> will understand just this once. </p>\n<p>He knocks, and waits for Mother to answer; she always used to in the past, even on the days where the moon was not full and Lan Zhan was not supposed to come, always at least with a <i>\u2018Zhan\u2019er, be good and go back, hmm?\u2019</i>, even if she would not open the door. </p>\n<p>Mother does not answer. She must be so upset at Lan Zhan. </p>\n<p>His lips wobble. The thought of Mother being disappointed in him makes his chest <i>ache</i>. </p>\n<p>He takes a couple of steps back, and sinks to his knees. \u201cMother,\u201d he calls out, because she must be listening. \u201cMother, Zhan\u2019er apologises for his actions.\u201d </p>\n<p>He waits for her to ask for an elaboration, the way she always does. She takes pleasure out of coaxing words out of Lan Zhan, and Lan Zhan similarly takes pleasure in Mother\u2019s gentle, self-satisfied smile when she gets what she wants. </p>\n<p>She does not ask. </p>\n<p>\u201cZhan\u2019er deliberately missed a class last week,\u201d Lan Zhan says urgently, eager now to clear the air, to draw a response, <i>anything</i>. \u201cWei Ying was ill, and he did not want to go. He asked Zhan\u2019er not to go too, and Zhan\u2019er\u2026 Zhan\u2019er wanted to stay with Wei Ying.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had brought Wei Ying to see Mother just the once, and Mother had smiled and patted them both on the heads. She had said that she was happy that they were friends, and had told them to look after each other. </p>\n<p>Surely Mother would understand why Lan Zhan missed his class. Surely now she would talk to Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother?\u201d he calls out.</p>\n<p>She does not respond. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t keep track of how long he kneels before Mother\u2019s door, but it must be past lunchtime now, because <i>dada</i> comes by, and crouches down by him. \u201cCome,\u201d he says, gentle. \u201cIt is cold out here, and you must be hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head. If he kneels for long enough, Mother may be convinced that he\u2019s repented, and she may come out to see him. </p>\n<p>\u201cZhan\u2019er, you will catch a cold out here, and what then?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head again. This time, he hears <i>dada</i>\u2019s deflated sigh, before <i>dada</i> slips out of his outer robe, and places it over Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>He comes back twice more. Once with hot tea that he makes Lan Zhan drink, and another time with osmanthus cake that Lan Zhan eats two mouthfuls of. Lan Zhan is grateful for <i>dada</i>, grateful that <i>dada</i> has not forced him to leave before he has earned Mother\u2019s forgiveness. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The third time his solitude is interrupted, it\u2019s Wei Ying who comes. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying takes one look at him, and then sinks down to his knees in the snow right next to Lan Zhan. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should go back, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying will wait with <i>gege</i>,\u201d Wei Ying says firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s cold if you\u2019re outside and it\u2019s snowing. Colder still if you\u2019re lonely.\u201d </p>\n<p>He speaks from experience, Lan Zhan thinks, and the ache in his chest worsens. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am not lonely,\u201d Lan Zhan tells him, in an effort to make Wei Ying go back to where it\u2019s warm. The sun will set soon, and it will get colder still. Lan Zhan has to be here to earn forgiveness, but Wei Ying has done no wrong. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying shakes his head. \u201cA-Ying will wait with <i>gege</i>,\u201d he repeats. </p>\n<p>They kneel outside the gentian house until their legs turn numb, and Lan Zhan is hungry and sleepy and cold from being out for so long. Wei Ying must be tired too, because he\u2019s started to sway, listing towards Lan Zhan, even though he doesn\u2019t utter a single word to complain. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan murmurs. \u201cGo back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying wants to stay with <i>gege</i>,\u201d Wei Ying\u2019s reply comes, as resolute as it was hours ago. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s kneeling pose loses its form at some point, and he ends up leaning against Lan Zhan heavily. The extra weight brings some discomfort, but Lan Zhan does his best to adjust, unwilling to disrupt Wei Ying\u2019s sleep. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s hand brush against his \u2014 his skin is cold to the touch, and Lan Zhan belatedly realises that Wei Ying is not dressed as warmly as he is. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan should keep kneeling. If he does, maybe Mother will forgive him and agree to see him. </p>\n<p>But he is also very concerned about how Wei Ying\u2019s skin feels unnaturally cold. Mother would not want him to keep kneeling out here, if it meant that Wei Ying would get sick, he thinks. </p>\n<p>He shakes at Wei Ying lightly. \u201cWei Ying. <i>Wei Ying</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Ying blearily opens his eyes. \u201c<i>Gege</i>? Will we go home now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods, and makes the track back to the <i>jingshi</i> with Wei Ying\u2019s chilly hand in his. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying falls ill as a result of being out in the cold for so long. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan expects to be admonished for it, but Uncle does not say a word. Still, Lan Zhan can recognise that it is his fault, and he makes amends to Wei Ying the way he knows Wei Ying will appreciate the most \u2014 he visits Wei Ying every day that Wei Ying is stuck bedridden. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Gege</i>, you look sad,\u201d Wei Ying says softly one morning when Lan Zhan brings breakfast for him. \u201cWhy is <i>gege</i> sad?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks away from Wei Ying\u2019s earnest eyes. It is a long moment before he says, \u201c<i>Dada</i> says Mother is not coming back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s face falls. He drops the steamed bun in his hand quickly in favour of pulling Lan Zhan into a tight hug. \u201cMy <i>baba</i> and <i>mama</i> didn\u2019t come back too,\u201d he whispers quietly to Lan Zhan, even though it\u2019s not a secret. Lan Zhan was the one who found him in the streets, alone, afterall. \u201c<i>Gege</i> will be sad and lonely for awhile, but remember, <i>gege</i> still has <i>da-gege</i> and A-Ying!\u201d </p>\n<p>The words comfort him. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan lets himself return Wei Ying\u2019s hug. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is nine when Wei Ying seems to have lost all his fear of being chased out of Cloud Recesses. Wei Ying starts being bolder, wilder, <i>freer</i>, a sure sign that he has finally accepted that Cloud Recesses is his home, and that he belongs there just as much as anyone else does.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a comforting thought, one that brings the smallest of smiles to Lan Zhan\u2019s lips. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice, having Wei Ying around. Wei Ying is loud and likes to laugh, but is quick to school himself to the perfect picture of a Lan Sect disciple whenever Uncle rounds the corner. His charade never really convinces Uncle, but Lan Zhan knows that Uncle has a soft spot for Wei Ying, even if it\u2019s just for the fact that Wei Ying is the only one who knows how to sweet talk him. </p>\n<p>Wei Ying spends a lot of his nights in the <i>jingshi</i>, in Lan Zhan\u2019s bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have your own room,\u201d Lan Zhan says one night, when Wei Ying clambers onto his bed, tugging half of Lan Zhan\u2019s covers over as he goes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYours is better,\u201d Wei Ying says simply, waving a hand to put the candle out. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan allows a small shake of his head. \u201cThey are the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, and then shifts closer. He doesn\u2019t like being cold \u2014 Lan Zhan thinks it maybe reminds him of the time he had to spend in the streets. \u201cYour room has <i>you</i> in it. That automatically makes it the best room,\u201d Wei Ying reasons, throwing an arm over Lan Zhan, and pressing himself close. </p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s lips curl up slightly. \u201cIt is <i>hai shi</i> now. Go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn, <i>gege</i>,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, and does as Lan Zhan says. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is already fifteen when Wei Ying asks him to pick out a courtesy name for him, two nights before his birthday.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s courtesy name was picked out for him after long discussions between Lan Qiren and Lan Xichen, as is customary for his family. Courtesy names are a gift from one's closest family, in the Lan Sect. </p>\n<p>That Wei Ying would ask <i>him</i> brings a deep sense of satisfaction, even though it does not exactly come as a surprise. Even Lan Qiren and Lan Xichen had been dropping discrete suggestions. </p>\n<p><i>Zhili</i> (\u77e5\u793c), for instance, would be a name that would hopefully instill some sense of propriety and etiquette in Wei Ying, Lan Qiren had hinted. Lan Xichen had merely grinned at that, and patted Lan Wangji gently on the thigh to remind him to wipe the incredulous look on his face off before their uncle noticed. </p>\n<p>As Lan Wangji was leaving the <i>hanshi</i> that day, Lan Xichen had explained that perhaps he should think of a name that would encompass all his wishes for Wei Ying. A courtesy name will stick with Wei Ying forever, it should have a loved one\u2019s blessings deeply imbued into it. </p>\n<p>It is good advice \u2014 his brother has a knack for telling him all the important things he needs to hear. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Wuxian?\u201d Lan Wangji asks. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s an auspicious name, he thinks, and he hopes Wei Ying likes it. He would wish Wei Ying a bountiful life, a life filled with immeasurable happiness. A life without envy, because Wei Ying should always have everything he wants. Everything that he could possibly need, Lan Wangji will always find a way to procure for him. </p>\n<p>A life without envy would suit Wei Ying, he thinks. </p>\n<p>\u201cWuxian?\u201d Wei Ying echoes. He sits up slowly, tries the name out on his tongue. \u201c<i>Wuxian</i>. Without envy. Wei Wuxian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying smiles at that. \u201cWell, it\u2019s accurate, I\u2019ll say. Who do I have to envy? I have everything!\u201d He lets out a soft laugh. \u201cIf anything, everyone should be envious of me.\u201d He lies back down, pillows his head on Lan Wangji\u2019s chest. \u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d he murmurs quietly again. \u201cI like it,\u201d he decides. \u201cThank you, <i>gege</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji smiles. \u201cMn,\u201d he hums. \u201cGo to sleep now, Wei Wuxian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying looks up at that, scrunching his nose. \u201c<i>Gege</i> has to keep calling me Wei Ying,\u201d he says, petulant. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji allows, voice gentle.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji, tucking himself back neatly into Lan Wangji\u2019s arms. He lets out a sleepy yawn. \u201cI like it when you say my name like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and holds Wei Ying close. \u201cThen I will keep saying it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>5.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is sixteen when the disciples from the other sects come, and Wei Wuxian gets drunk for the first time. </p>\n<p>He comes stumbling into the <i>jingshi</i> when it happens, past <i>zi shi</i>, breath smelling of alcohol when he climbs into Lan Wangji\u2019s bed and presses himself close. </p>\n<p>\u201cConsumption of alcohol is not allowed in Cloud Recesses,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI only had a bit,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, pouting slightly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I tell you, will you promise not to report them?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks warily, much to Lan Wangji\u2019s exasperation. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has no intention of reporting any of Wei Wuxian\u2019s drinking buddies. Reporting them mean that Wei Wuxian will get into trouble too. Wei Wuxian already gets into too much trouble without Lan Wangji having to tattle on him. </p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Satisfied, Wei Wuxian tells him, \u201cQinghe Nie Sect, Nie Huaisang. Yunmeng Jiang Sect, Jiang Cheng.\u201d </p>\n<p><i>Jiang Cheng.</i> </p>\n<p>He means Jiang Wanyin, the young master and heir of the Jiang Sect. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s use of Jiang Wanyin\u2019s birth name brings an unpleasantness in Lan Wangji\u2019s chest. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should not partake in their tomfoolery,\u201d he admonishes, instead of asking how Wei Wuxian has gotten so close to Jiang Wanyin so quickly. </p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps <i>er-gege</i> should join us next time,\u201d Wei Wuxian suggests with an impish grin. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes, and does not reply. He tries hard not to focus on the fact that there will be a next time. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Gege</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian says by his ear. \u201cNie-<i>xiong</i> showed me some books, earlier.\u201d He shifts closer to Lan Wangji as he speaks, close enough that his lips touch the shell of Lan Wangji\u2019s ear. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can feel his ears burn from the touch of Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey were very provocative books,\u201d Wei Wuxian adds. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Wei Ying</i>.\u201d Lan Wangji sits up, dislodging Wei Wuxian who is half splayed across his body in the process. \u201cWhat was the purpose of Nie Huaisang showing you the books?\u201d he asks, voice low, furious. </p>\n<p>Did Nie Huaisang try-</p>\n<p>Would he <i>dare</i>? </p>\n<p>Would Wei Wuxian have said <i>yes</i>? </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles at him, and tugs him back down onto the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Wei Wuxian confirms. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to do any of those things with Nie Huaisang.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lets out a breath he hadn\u2019t known that he was holding. </p>\n<p>\u201cI only want to do them with you, <i>gege</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian adds, voice so soft Lan Wangji almost thinks that he\u2019s imagined it, except Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips brush against the corner of Lan Wangji\u2019s lips. <i>A kiss.</i> \u201cIt\u2019s past <i>hai shi, gege</i>. You must be tired. Let\u2019s rest?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t sleep that night. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>6.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is seventeen, and his heart is beating to a rhythm he cannot seem to understand. His thoughts have been a mess since Wei Wuxian kissed him two weeks ago, and since then, meditation has been difficult, because he cannot find peace. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian <i>kissed</i> him, and implied that he\u2019d wanted to do <i>other things</i> with Lan Wangji, and-</p>\n<p>And then he\u2019d woken up with a hangover, and promptly forgot everything that he\u2019d said to Lan Wangji. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hadn\u2019t reminded him of it; he isn\u2019t sure how he could. </p>\n<p>He does what he does best in situations that make him feel off-kilter. He seeks solitude. </p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s quest for solitude is doomed from the start, knowing Wei Wuxian\u2019s tendencies to seek him out when he least wants to be found. Lan Wangji knows this to be true, and yet, his stomach still churns when Wei Wuxian comes running down the steps to the cold springs. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Gege!</i>\u201d he calls out cheerily, already undoing his sash, but frowns when Lan Wangji hoists himself out of the water, and dresses quickly. \u201cHuh? Are you already done? I thought we could soak together for awhile!\u201d He pouts at Lan Wangji, and crosses over to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve not been around much recently, <i>gege</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Shufu</i> has asked me to help with copying scriptures,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him, which is not exactly a lie. He doesn\u2019t tell Wei Wuxian that he\u2019d been the one to volunteer to spend more of his time in the library pavillion. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a face. \u201c<i>Xiansheng</i> is too much,\u201d he complains half-heartedly. \u201cYou can copy scriptures any other time, but here he is, keeping you from bonding with the visiting disciples. They\u2019ll be gone in a couple of weeks.\u201d </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t miss the disappointment in Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice, and wonders if it\u2019s Jiang Wanyin that Wei Wuxian cannot bear to see leave. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying should spend time with them before they leave, then.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him. \u201cBut I miss <i>gege</i> too,\u201d he murmurs quietly, and then wraps his arms around Lan Wangji. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s heart skips a beat. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Gege</i>, let\u2019s spend time together today? I\u2019ve been invited to join the Jiang siblings for dinner, but I\u2019m sure Yanli-<i>jie</i> will not mind an extra mouth to feed.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou spend a great deal of time with the Jiang siblings,\u201d Lan Wangji says, instead of replying.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn!\u201d Wei Wuxian hums. \u201cJiang Cheng is fun to bully, and Yanli-<i>jie</i> makes the most delicious food!\u201d He peers up at Lan Wangji. \u201cShe\u2019s very easy to talk to. She just helped me to figure out a lot of things about myself recently.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lan Wangji says, inexplicably hurt. Lan Wangji is used to being the person Wei Wuxian would go to to speak of his troubles. He forces himself to smile. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian beams at him. \u201cWill you come to dinner, then?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI should not impose where I\u2019m unwanted,\u201d Lan Wangji says. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s smile slips. \u201c<i>Gege</i>?\u201d His arms tighten minutely where they\u2019re clasped around Lan Wangji\u2019s midriff. \u201cHas Wei Ying done something to annoy <i>gege</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks away from him. \u201cOf course not.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI went to the <i>jingshi</i> last night, but the door was bolted,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cYou never used to lock the door until after I arrived.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hadn\u2019t thought that Wei Wuxian would notice; after all, it\u2019s been several days since the last time he came to the <i>jingshi</i> at night to share Lan Wangji\u2019s bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf Wei Ying has done anything to make <i>gege</i> upset\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips turn down into a frown. \u201cThen <i>gege</i> can punish me however he wants!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnnecessary,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI\u2019m not upset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could copy scriptures with you?\u201d Wei Wuxian suggests. \u201cMy writing is not as neat, but I will try hard to make it look neater. If <i>gege</i> is worried I will be too disruptive, you can even use the silencing charm on me!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI\u2019m really not upset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you want to spend time with me anymore?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, and oh, his eyes are shining, wet with tears. His voice wobbles when he says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you <i>like me</i> anymore?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels <i>terrible</i>. \u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLying is forbidden in Cloud Recesses,\u201d Wei Wuxian interjects, before Lan Wangji is able to insist, for the third time, that he isn\u2019t upset. \u201cPlease tell me what\u2019s wrong, <i>gege</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Xichen has always told him that the trick to finding all the right words is to formulate his thoughts, to speak slowly, to make his intent clear. Lan Wangji holds onto these precepts, and tries to put his thoughts into words. </p>\n<p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Lan Wangji confesses. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, then reopens them slowly, and says it again, \u201cI like you, Wei Ying.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes go wide with surprise. </p>\n<p>\u201cI like you, and I don\u2019t know what I should do about it,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him. \u201cIt\u2019s...difficult for me to decide what I should do, not knowing how you feel about me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIs it not apparent?\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. \u201cHow I feel about you, is that not the most obvious thing under the sky?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he chokes out, \u201cit is not.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen you should ask me,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him, and he\u2019s smiling now, the same wide, happy smile that makes Lan Wangji\u2019s heart feel too full. \u201cBe proactive in seeking knowledge,\u201d he quotes the sect rules. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can feel himself shake. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he breathes. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Gege</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian returns, closing the distance between them, and taking Lan Wangji\u2019s trembling hands in his. \u201cAsk me, <i>gege</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a grounding breath, and steels himself. \u201cWei Ying, do you return my feelings?\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes crinkle. \u201cOf course I do,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji. \u201cI want to hold your hand, and kiss your lips, and have you hold me in bed every night. I want to spend all my time with you, because every minute I spend away from you feels too long. I want you to smile at me like- Yes, like <i>this</i>, all the time! <i>Gege</i>, I\u2019ve felt this way for so long! You can\u2019t possibly imagine how long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already kissed me.\u201d It feels suddenly important to tell Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cWhat? <i>When?</i>\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat night you got drunk with Nie Huaisang and Jiang Wanyin,\u201d he reminds Wei Wuxian, and smiles when Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheeks flush. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that was an alcohol-induced fevered dream,\u201d he confesses. And then scrunches his nose. \u201c<i>Gege</i>, was it a good kiss?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels the tips of his ears grow hot. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other kisses to compare to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, a happy, bright sound that reverberates around them, and makes Lan Wangji\u2019s heart sing. \u201cWe can fix that,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji, and then kisses him and kisses him and <i>kisses him</i>. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>7.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is eighteen the first time he is\u2026<i>intimate</i> with Wei Wuxian. </p>\n<p>He wakes up the next morning to a naked Wei Wuxian curled in his arms, breathing soft and even, and flushes at the marks he can see that he\u2019s left on Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin. He would be mortified, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Wei Wuxian was egging him on last night, urging him to mark him up properly. </p>\n<p>At least he\u2019s had the foresight to not leave marks where Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes will not be able to cover. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he whispers, pressing his lips to Wei Wuxian\u2019s brow. \u201cWei Ying, you have to wake up, or we\u2019ll be late for class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lets out a sleepy whine, and shifts closer to Lan Wangji. \u201cI\u2019m <i>tired</i>,\u201d he says. \u201c<i>Gege</i> tired me out last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can feel his ears burn. He should have stopped after the first time, but he had <i>wanted</i>, and Wei Wuxian had been willing. </p>\n<p>He gently pries himself out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hold, and tucks the covers back over Wei Wuxian. \u201cRest,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI will tell <i>shufu</i> you are unwell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes open at that, and he lets out a delighted laugh. \u201c<i>Gege</i>, you pamper me!\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cIf this is the treatment I get after a night of being very well-loved by my <i>er-gege</i>, then I want to be bedded by you every night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji leans down so their noses are touching. \u201cWei Ying should learn not to tease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen Lan Zhan should learn not to give me opportunities to tease,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs back, and then shifts so he can press his lips to Lan Wangji\u2019s, and sighs into the resulting kiss. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes stock of the current situation, runs a quick count in his head, and presses Wei Wuxian back to the bed. If they are quick, he will make it to class in time. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is almost late for class, but he gets there in time anyway, with a very self-satisfied Wei Wuxian pressed to his side. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>8.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is nineteen, and he knows Wei Wuxian as well as he knows himself now. </p>\n<p>He knows the punched-out gasp Wei Wuxian lets out whenever Lan Wangji enters him, knows the taste of Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips, knows the brightness in wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes whenever he is about to urge Lan Wangji to go faster, harder, deeper. </p>\n<p>He knows all the different ways Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips can curve into variations of smiles, knows his mind well enough to anticipate Wei Wuxian\u2019s words before he voices them, knows the kindness that Wei Wuxian radiates, knows the beat of Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>He knows <i>Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart</i>, and he knows his own. </p>\n<p>It is because he knows, that he understands that the racing of his own heart whenever Wei Wuxian smiles at him is an indicator that he\u2019s in love. </p>\n<p>It is easy to take the next step, once he has reached the correct conclusions. </p>\n<p>\u201cHand,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, one night when they are in bed, satiated from their earlier bout of activities. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian passes Lan Wangji his left hand. \u201cDoes <i>gege</i> have a gift for me?\u201d he asks curiously. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks him in the eye, and then very deliberately picks up his discarded forehead ribbon, lying by the side. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes widen, his lips part in surprise. </p>\n<p>He looks so lovely that Lan Wangji can\u2019t quite help the half-smile that tugs at his lips as he carefully winds the forehead ribbon around Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist, finishing off with an intricate bow. </p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t had a chance to practise the knot, not with Wei Wuxian\u2019s presence being a constant around him, but he has read the ancient scrolls, and he has observed the diagrams carefully. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you-\u201d Wei Wuxian manages to choke out. </p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at the forehead ribbon tied around his wrist for a long time. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had originally thought that he would be nervous, that it should be nerve-wrecking to be putting his feelings on display like this, but he knows deep down in his heart that his feelings are returned, and he is not afraid. </p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian next looks up at Lan Wangji, his eyes shine with tears. \u201cThis is the wedding knot,\u201d he says shakily. \u201cThis is how spouses used to bind themselves to each other.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees softly, smiling. He\u2019d been right to guess that Wei Wuxian would understand, even if the tradition has long since been abandoned, and considered too frivolous. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is how cultivation partners in the Lan Sect used to tell each other that they are <i>loved</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods. \u201cWei Ying <i>is</i> loved.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian throws his arms around Lan Wangji. \u201cSo is <i>gege</i>,\u201d he breathes out. \u201cOh, Lan Zhan, I love you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji presses a kiss to his hair, and holds him tightly for the rest of the night. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian spends a good portion of the night staring at the wedding knot, and when he eventually is lulled to sleep, he holds his left hand close to his chest, as if protecting the forehead ribbon on his wrist.</p>\n<p>It will be a pity to have to remove the ribbon from Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist in the morning.</p>\n<p>But as long as Lan Wangji swears to always tie it back on in the evenings, he can\u2019t imagine that Wei Wuxian will be too displeased. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>9.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is twenty when he makes the decision to marry Wei Wuxian. </p>\n<p>It is against the rules to make important matrimonial decisions without the consultation of one\u2019s elders, but Lan Wangji knows what will make him happy, will make <i>Wei Wuxian</i> happy, and so he must marry Wei Wuxian. </p>\n<p>It does not sit right with him to exclude his uncle from the decision, however, so he goes to Lan Qiren\u2019s study one evening before dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cShufu, I wish to talk to you about Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lan Qiren murmurs. \u201cYou have been notified of the missive from the Jiang Sect, then?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns at that. \u201cNo, Wangji has not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren regards him, and then says, \u201cSect Leader Jiang writes that Wei Changze was a loyal member of his sect, and a very dear friend. He, on behalf of the Jiang Sect, asks for Wei Wuxian\u2019s opinion on marrying back into the Jiang Sect, and returning to Yunmeng. He offers the hand of his son and heir, Jiang Wanyin. I believe Wei Wuxian is familiar with Jiang-<i>gongzi</i> from his time in the Cloud Recesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach clenches painfully. The thought of Wei Wuxian leaving Cloud Recesses, of Wei Wuxian <i>marrying another</i>\u2026 </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says fiercely. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Lan Qiren asks, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says again, calmer. He takes a grounding breath, and drops into a proper bow, prostrating himself before Lan Qiren. \u201c<i>Shufu</i>, I would like your permission to marry Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the sharp intake of breath from Lan Qiren. Lan Qiren is <i>surprised</i>, even though he really should not be. Lan Wangji has taken no steps to hide his affections for Wei Wuxian; this has always been plain to Lan Xichen, and the same should be clear to his uncle, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is what I came to speak to you about,\u201d Lan Wangji says, straightening his back to look his uncle in the eye. \u201cI would like to marry Wei Ying,\u201d he tells Lan Qiren again, this time firmer. </p>\n<p>\u201cWangji\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Lan Qiren blinks, and regains his composure. \u201cWhat will you do if I do not give you my permission as head of the family?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will marry Wei Ying regardless,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and knows the truth behind his statement the moment the words leave his lips. He <i>will</i> marry Wei Wuxian. Nothing, short of Wei Wuxian being unwilling, will stop him. \u201cWei Ying has expressed an interest in travelling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would elope, is what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Lan Qiren concludes. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf necessary,\u201d Lan Wangji says. There is no reason to lie. </p>\n<p>Lan Qiren lets out a long sigh. He is quiet for a long moment, before he asks, \u201cIs Wei Wuxian willing?\u201d</p>\n<p>The door bursts open, and Wei Wuxian spills into the room, clearly having been eavesdropping outside. He flashes both Lan Wangji and Lan Qiren a sheepish smile when he comes and kneels down beside Lan Wangji. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Xiansheng</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201cWuxian is more than willing!\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns to face Wei Wuxian, and smiles at him. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Xiansheng</i>, I have loved Lan Zhan my entire life,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells Lan Qiren sincerely. \u201cI promise I will take good care of him. I promise!\u201d</p>\n<p>That cannot be Lan Qiren\u2019s concern. Wei Wuxian has always been an unspoken favourite of Lan Qiren\u2019s since he was a child, even if Lan Qiren is quick to deny the same. </p>\n<p>\u201cWangji returns Wei Ying\u2019s feelings,\u201d he tells Lan Qiren quietly. \u201cWangji also promises to take good care of Wei Ying.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Qiren spends a long moment looking at the both of them, and finally, <i>finally</i> approves of the marriage. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>10.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is twenty-one when they complete their three bows. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s an unusually beautiful day \u2014 the sun shines brightly above them, the skies are clear, the winds that blow are soft and gentle, and Wei Wuxian is a sight to behold in his wedding robes. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji finds it hard to turn his gaze away from Wei Wuxian, and so he doesn\u2019t even bother trying. He keeps his eyes on Wei Wuxian whenever he can, revelling in the joy it brings to him to know that by the end of the day, Wei Wuxian will be his <i>husband</i>. </p>\n<p>They retreat from the festivities close to <i>you shi</i>; it\u2019s a little early, but no-one stops them from leaving. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tangles his fingers with Lan Wangji\u2019s, and skips most of the way back to the <i>jingshi</i>, eyes bright with mirth. Lan Wangji smiles back at Wei Wuxian, and follows his lead. </p>\n<p>It brings him much satisfaction when they cross the threshold of the <i>jingshi</i> that Wei Wuxian will never have to sneak into the <i>jingshi</i> to sleep with Lan Wangji again, because this will be their home from now on.</p>\n<p>He smiles at Wei Wuxian, and presses their foreheads together. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says softly. </p>\n<p>It feels like a lifetime ago when he found Wei Wuxian by the streets. If he hadn\u2019t brought Wei Wuxian back with him then, what would have become of them both? Certainly, Lan Wangji would not have had any cause to experience joy the way he does now, with Wei Wuxian. Most of the happy things that have happened in his life have their roots in Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan. <i>Er-gege</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, smiling back at Lan Wangji softly. \u201c<i>Husband</i>,\u201d he whispers at last, shyly, softly, and it\u2019s all Lan Wangji can do to press their lips together.</p>\n<p>They are both smiling too widely for it to be a good kiss by any measure, but Lan Wangji cannot find it in himself to care.</p>\n<p>They are in love, <i>married</i>, and have a whole future ahead of them to be this happy together.</p>\n<p>Forever almost doesn\u2019t seem long enough. </p>\n<p>\u201cHusband,\u201d Lan Wangji returns just as gently, and then kisses Wei Wuxian.</p>"
