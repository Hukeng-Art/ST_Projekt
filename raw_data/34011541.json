  "text": "<p>Lan Wangji first knows something is wrong when, in the middle of the day, his older brother fetches him from the library.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen is strangely unsmiling when he appears, a strained tension drawing unfamiliar lines in his face. It\u2019s an expression that Lan Wangji has only seen before in fraught circumstances.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cXiongzhang,\u201d he says quietly as he follows Lan Xichen across the main courtyard, past two pavilions; his brother is evidently directing them to the lanshi. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this, Lan Xichen attempts a smile over his shoulder, half in profile. It is the opposite of comforting. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about, Wangji. We have known, for some time, that this day would inevitably arrive, given your age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> What day? </em>Lan Wangji wonders, dread pitting in his stomach. He is already twenty years old. What does his age have to do with anything?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was even younger than you when I received my first one,\u201d Lan Xichen continues, his tone lightening as they approach the lanshi, and then they\u2019re entering the hall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji glances around at the congregated party, all seated in waiting, which includes his shufu and nearly thirty of his sect elders. They all watch Lan Wangji\u2019s entry with a grimness that does little to dispel the tension knotting in Lan Wangji by the second.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d his shufu says from the head of the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve come. Please, sit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji quietly does, tucking Bichen by his side and folding his hands in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren wastes no time on suspense, which is something of a relief. \u201cA proposal letter has arrived from the YunmengJiang sect. Jiang-zongzhu has proposed a courtship of marriage with Wangji, and subsequently an alliance between our two sects.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels his stomach swoop as though the ground\u2019s given way beneath him. A ringing sound hollows out in his ears as the elders around him begin to mutter darkly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has dreaded this day since his childhood, but he never imagined it would come so soon, or with such little warning. The YunmengJiang sect? Which of his children could Jiang Fengmian possibly have in mind for a match with Lan Wangji? The idea of being betrothed to Jiang Wanyin makes his nausea curl even tighter, pressing against his throat. Jiang Yanli, nearly moreso. Lan Wangji had encountered the Jiang siblings during lectures the previous summer, when several sects sent disciples to study in the Cloud Recesses, and he is familiar enough with them to know neither would be an ideal match.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That summer...that same summer, he had met\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens his mouth to speak, and no sound comes out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren\u2019s expression blackens as he scans over the lines of the letter, his fingers crumpling the paper. When he does speak, it\u2019s with apparent difficulty. \u201cJiang-zongzhu has put forth the YunmengJiang\u2019s first disciple Wei Wuxian as a suitor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s jaw rehinges with an audible click. All at once, the elders begin to vocally protest, shouting down Lan Qiren as though he himself had made the suggestion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying. The sick feeling suddenly eases, subsumed by a slow-mounting shock.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAn alliance with the Jiang sect would be advantageous,\u201d Lan Xichen is saying mildly through the clamor, \u201cin resisting the growing influence of the Wen sect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Alliance</em>?\u201d one of the other elders scoffs with a shimmering scorn. \u201cWhat alliance? Wei Ying is the son of a servant and a myrmidon. You all have heard what they say about him.\u201d A ripple of assent murmurs through the congregated party. Lan Wangji\u2019s fists slowly tighten in his lap. \u201cIt would be a disgrace!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody has taken a moment to ask Lan Wangji his thoughts. No one has even spared him a glance. They\u2019re all arguing in earnest now, breaking several sect rules to do so, a furious chattering of noise. It reminds Lan Wangji of a childhood memory at the beach, when he\u2019d first seen a flock of bickering seagulls in the surf.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever his bloodline, Wei Wuxian is no mere servant,\u201d Lan Xichen\u2019s voice cuts through the babble, steady and unmistakably clear. \u201cThe Jiangs take him as family and as their head disciple. His potential as a cultivator is also considerable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking him as family is no surprise,\u201d one of the other elders mutters, \u201cif the rumors are to be believed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another ominous mumble sweeps through them like a rank wind. Lan Qiren has not said another word the entire time, the line of his jaw tight and his brow dark.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI say let them pass the boy off to whoever is gullible enough to have him,\u201d the first elder, Lan Qingsheng, says derisively. \u201c<em> Pah. </em> The audacity to proposition <em> Wangji, </em>when Wei Wuxian is no better than a common wh \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren\u2019s head snaps around at this, his nostrils flaring, and the elder falls silent at once, having the grace to look a little sheepish. The other seniors have gone quiet as well, visibly abashed after this outburst.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ringing in Lan Wangji\u2019s ears grows louder, a white whine of sound.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying, passed off to whoever will take him. Stifling his cultivation and wit to act as a servant for whoever will have him, whoever will touch him. Wei Ying, his eyes warm like polished riverbed stones catching the sun, the scrunch of his nose when he laughs; hot-headed and arrogant and brash, too smart for his own good, for his own safety, a reckoning with a sword or a bow in his hand, Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stands before he\u2019s aware of the movement. Every head in the room swivels to him, astonishment clear in their faces. The surprise from his shufu and xiongzhang is tangible. As a general rule, he never speaks at gatherings like this. To go as far as standing is the closest he\u2019s ever come to being disruptive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRespond to the Jiangs\u2019 proposal,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His voice does not waver, even though everything inside him feels like it\u2019s vibrating in place. \u201cAnd tell them Lan Wangji will have Wei Wuxian of YunmengJiang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silence falls like a ringing slap to the cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then pandemonium ensues.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment he says it \u2014 the moment he leaves the lanshi with the elders\u2019 outrage buzzing in his wake like a swarm of hornets \u2014 Lan Wangji also has to question his own decision, his own clarity of mind. He does not even like Wei Wuxian. He hardly tolerates him, as a general rule.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had simply stepped in as \u2014 a magnanimous gesture, to protect him from some worse fate. Better to pair him with Lan Wangji, who will not lay an untoward finger on him; who won\u2019t stifle his burgeoning cultivation and swordsmanship, who won\u2019t subject him to a lifetime of servitude. Wei Wuxian would do the same for him if their roles were reversed, would he not? They have never been friends, but they have fought together, hunted together, studied together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In his time at the Cloud Recesses, Wei Wuxian had trailed around after Lan Wangji like a noisy shadow, and in spite of his best efforts, Lan Wangji had grown accustomed to it, to his unruly and unremitting chatter and his frequent misbehavior. Even to his beauty, which Wei Wuxian wielded like any of his other weapons: flashing, incisive strikes unbeholden to anything resembling seriousness. Entirely inescapable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wouldn\u2019t the experience of being married to him be just the same? Annoying, but weatherable?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the small, not-insignificant fact that each time Lan Wangji pictures him with someone else \u2014 some unfamiliar, older man stripping Wei Wuxian\u2019s clothes off and claiming him \u2014 a sour taste rises in his throat, coating the roof of his mouth. Certainly no one deserves that treatment. Certainly that is the reason for \u2014 for why he\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Qingsheng interjects, rupturing the train of thought. Lan Wangji turns toward the voice, still somewhat distracted. Lan Qiren and Lan Xichen stand just behind the other elder, their arms clasped behind their back as they watch the exchange impassively.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI beg you to reconsider,\u201d Lan Qingsheng continues, windless from speed-walking to catch up with him. \u201cWhatever sense of obligation you feel to pursue this alliance, please forget it. There will be other and better-fitted partnerships to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no reason to refuse,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. \u201cThe YunmengJiang is a friend to the GusuLan. Let us not poison the well by rejecting them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Qingsheng begs again, going paler. \u201cThink twice about what you\u2019re doing. You could marry any suitor in the four great sects and none would refuse you. You do not have to settle for your first proposal; at least consider all other options.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For his entire life, Lan Wangji thinks, his marriageability has been leveraged like a stone in a game of go. He had always known, growing up, that whatever partner he ended up with, it would not be of his choosing or his volition. Accepting Wei Wuxian, as little as they get along, feels like a reclamation of something lost. Of something his mother, too, had lost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQianbei,\u201d his xiongzhang interrupts, not rudely. (Never rudely.) \u201cWangji has consented to the proposal. The benefits of such an alliance far outweigh whatever concerns one may have about Wei Wuxian\u2019s character. He is young and unrestrained, as many boys are in their teenage years, but he will learn our ways in time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His shufu\u2019s mouth is pursed with unhappiness at Lan Xichen\u2019s side, his brows low over his eyes, but he does not counter Lan Xichen\u2019s appeal to reason. Perhaps, in spite of his personal antipathy toward Wei Wuxian, he too sees the unarguable benefits to such an arrangement. In any case, he will not openly contradict Lan Wangji\u2019s decision in front of one of the other elders. Perhaps he has a private rebuke prepared for later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Qingsheng looks back and forth between the three of them with growing, baffled despair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat boy will bring us to destruction,\u201d Lan Qingsheng proclaims in a shaking voice, and what he says next lingers with Lan Wangji for the rest of the week. \u201cMark my words, Wangji. Wei Wuxian will ruin you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The weeks leading up to the wedding are a blur, time skipping too quickly and then slowing with agonizing torpor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s sect takes care of the details, brisk and characteristically without fanfare; the exchange of family gifts, the letters of betrothal, the most fortuitous day calculated and selected. Lan Wangji feels as though it\u2019s a marriage happening to someone else, for how little he\u2019s involved in the logistics. And each day that creeps closer, he thinks more and more of Wei Ying, the last time they\u2019d parted in Moling for a night-hunt, on civil terms but certainly not overwarm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surely Wei Wuxian cannot be amenable to this arrangement, given how much he and Lan Wangji had butted heads when they\u2019d studied together. Given how much he values his own freedom, unbound by anyone or anything. He certainly values being unbound by the GusuLan\u2019s disciplines and Lan Wangji\u2019s reinforcement of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Lan Wangji, who since his childhood has been close to no one except his xiongzhang, the concept of sharing his household with a stranger has always been nothing short of horrifying. Although marriage to a man in the gentries is not out of the question, based on some political alliances, it has also always been his impression by his sect that he would be forced to marry a woman. There is always the question of heirs to consider, and even within male pairings, a sexless union is common, even expected, under the assumption that the arrangement is purely political and usually not preferable. With this knowledge, as he had grown older, Lan Wangji had come to dread the looming expectation that he would partake in...more carnal acts with a wife, as is to be expected with marital duties. Until now, the thought of that intimacy with an arranged live-in partner has been as alien to him as it is nauseating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, yes, since he was a child, since he had first become aware of his own...alienating effect on others, Lan Wangji has long resigned himself to a loveless marriage. He would have even settled for a companionate one, so long as his partner was agreeable and unbothersome and let him have his own space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could not have even begun to predict Wei Wuxian, who is disagreeable and incredibly bothersome and has seemingly never encountered the concept of personal space in his life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yet. In spite of these facts Lan Wangji knows to be true, when he thinks of a life with Wei Wuxian, he cannot help but feel the tiniest whisper of relief. Of hope.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The actual wedding day, when it does eventually arrive, transpires just as quickly and just as surreally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The preparations begin at dawn, an aromatic bath with pomelo leaves and Lan Wangji\u2019s hair washed, oiled, perfumed; a roomy silence as his xiongzhang\u2019s fingers comb through the drying strands. Layers upon layers of cinnabar-red silk and brocade; his mother\u2019s jade hairpin, crane-shaped, tucked snug underneath one of his braidings. The arrival of the bridal sedan, ceremonious and strangely silent, flocked by a violet wave of Jiang disciples. The tea ceremony, four empty spaces and his shufu, frowning with tension and his mouth puckered; Jiang Fengmian, the only smile in the room, and Yu Ziyuan, scowling at Wei Wuxian as though he\u2019s a blight. Throughout the ceremony, Lan Wangji can feel the presence of his xiongzhang, Jiang Wanyin and Jiang Yanli behind them, whose expressions Lan Wangji cannot see, but he hears low sniffles that he thinks might be Wei Wuxian\u2019s sister crying softly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the tea-pouring are his and Wei Wuxian\u2019s bows, to the heavens and earth and everyone who has come before, and then to each other. The locks of their hair, snipped and knotted and tucked away. The Lan handfasting ceremony, Lan Wangji\u2019s ribbon tied tightly around Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist. Twelve gifts, and then the banquet. Out of respect to their visitors, his sect had included meat-based dishes prepared from Caiyi Town and one of the neighboring villages. It consists of mostly seafood like shark\u2019s fin soup, lobster, abalone and sea cucumber, but also roast duck, chicken and a suckling pig. Lan Wangji finds himself unable to touch any of it, too tense to stomach anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He and Wei Wuxian are then presented with a cup of sweet wine, the effects of which Lan Wangji immediately disperses with his core. Lan Wangji watches the cup vanish beneath Wei Wuxian\u2019s red veil, knocked back in one swallow and reemerging empty. Since he first stepped out of the sedan, Wei Wuxian\u2019s face has been concealed by the cloth, impossible to read through body language alone. Lan Wangji has never been near Wei Wuxian when he has not talked his way through something, teased and laughed and shouted and whined and flirted, but his silence throughout the processions is resolute, an unbreached wall. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t attempt to speak to him throughout the entire wedding; how can he? With how quickly the rites proceed, there\u2019s hardly the opportunity to catch a glimpse of him, let alone attempt conversation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the banquet, Wei Wuxian vanishes for half a shi, escorted somewhere by the GusuLan\u2019s two physicians for reasons Lan Wangji is afraid to contemplate. Upon his return, the two of them are escorted to the bridal chamber by their families on either side. As they walk alongside each other, Lan Wangji notices that Wei Wuxian has his hand clasped tightly with Jiang Yanli\u2019s, who\u2019s begun to cry again. In another sect, Lan Wangji and his new husband might be subjected to light-hearted teasing about the eventful night ahead of them, but the silence from his shufu and his xiongzhang is like mountain fog, thick and impenetrable, and the Jiangs seem equally disinclined to lighten the mood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they finally approach the guesthouse, Jiang Yanli turns and grips Wei Wuxian tightly around the shoulders, her face buried in his neck as she continues to sob. Lan Wangji hears Wei Wuxian soothing her, a gentle snatch of \u201cHao le hao le, we did our crying earlier, shijie, don\u2019t be sad for me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan observes her daughter\u2019s tears with a darkening scowl, striking an uncanny resemblance to her son, while Jiang Fengmian gently guides Jiang Yanli away by the shoulders and wishes Wei Wuxian well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like his mother, Jiang Wanyin stands stiffly watching off to the side, his stinging black gaze pinned on Lan Wangji with startling vitriol. As though it\u2019s Lan Wangji personally prying Wei Wuxian from his sister\u2019s arms and hauling him away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He might as well be, Lan Wangji thinks, and then the two of them are alone for the first time, crossing the threshold of the guesthouse together, into their new life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their bridal chamber is drenched in draperies of red and gold, a pair of long feng candles burning near the marital bed. The covers and pillows have been scattered with dried fruits and nuts, of which Lan Wangji can pick out persimmons, red dates, longans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Wei Wuxian is...moving toward the bed now, to seat himself there as he is supposed to, turning his shrouded face toward Lan Wangji to bring the evening to an inevitable conclusion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, as Lan Wangji approaches him, he imagines for a wild moment that he\u2019s married someone who is not Wei Wuxian at all. That he\u2019ll lift the bridal veil, and a stranger\u2019s face will peer back at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a fine tremor in Lan Wangji\u2019s hands as he lifts the covering, and then he\u2019s staring at Wei Wuxian for the first time in months, nearly a year. For a moment, they do nothing but that \u2014 drinking each other in, the sheer strangeness of this reunion after so long apart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is one yawning, endless moment in which Wei Wuxian\u2019s uncertainty is clear, his trepidation and misgivings laid bare in the wideness of his eyes, the blood-drain from his face. Then something shifts, and Wei Wuxian cracks a smile and says, with almost convincing levity, \u201cHi, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji responds when he finds his voice, then appraises him more closely, absorbing the details of him that have faded in their time apart. Wei Wuxian is always handsome, disarmingly so, but his beauty today is nearly heart-stopping. His cheeks have been pinked with rouge, the devastating effect of his bright eyes starkened by kohl and his lips painted a shade darker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at what they\u2019ve put me in,\u201d Wei Wuxian complains good-naturedly, pinching at a heavy red sleeve encrusted with gold lace. Oh, Lan Wangji realizes with a startling lurch. He\u2019s missed him. Impossibly. The tension that\u2019s coiled itself tighter and tighter in Lan Wangji for weeks, throughout the events of the day, loosens at the sound of his voice, a buoyant relief rising in him like hot air. Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI look ridiculous,\u201d Wei Wuxian is saying, then gives a distorted pout as he pinches at one of his own ruddied cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji disagrees, too abruptly, enough so that Wei Wuxian looks at him in surprise. The fierce, deep awkwardness that Lan Wangji feels is nearly paralytic, rendering him clumsy. He has never in his life felt so at sea. But. Wei Wuxian looks lovely. Lovelier than anyone Lan Wangji has ever met. Shouldn\u2019t someone tell him so?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian leans back on his hands into the mattress, his legs falling apart as he tilts his head at Lan Wangji. His gaze slides over Lan Wangji like the stroke of a hand, up and then down. \u201cLan Zhan, you look so handsome! I think of the two of us, you make for the prettier bride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Lan Wangji mutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet you never thought you\u2019d end up like this, huh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, rocking one of his knees back and forth. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when they told me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This exchange is...easier. Commiserating, acknowledging the strangeness of it all, across all of these weeks of anticipation, with so many involved parties pulling their strings. Lan Wangji feels himself relax further.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has been strange,\u201d Lan Wangji says, more easily than before. \u201cFast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So </em>fast,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees emphatically. He sits up straighter and scoots across the bed so he\u2019s closer to Lan Wangji. \u201cThey told me I was set to marry you \u2014 imagine my reaction, Lan Zhan, ha! \u2014 and the next thing I know, all of these gifts and letters start showing up at Lotus Pier, good heavens, it was a whole ordeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying likes attention,\u201d Lan Wangji points out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em> yeah,</em>\u201d Wei Wuxian says, unrepentant, then screws up his face. \u201cBut not all of <em> that</em>. Not all of that...romantic, formal wedding stuff, aiyo, it was all too much to bear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hums his agreement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A fiercely awkward silence settles between them. Lan Wangji is unaccustomed to silence where Wei Wuxian is involved, and it is not within his nature to be the one to break it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says at last, biting his lip. \u201cIs now the part where we\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. He makes a vague and meaningless hand gesture. \u201cAren\u2019t we expected to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, they\u2019re expected to...most will have a strong idea of what they\u2019re doing right now, and it does not involve conversation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stare at each other for another excruciating, unending moment. Then quickly, nearly tripping, Wei Wuxian stands from the bed and starts to fumble with his robes in jerky movements, no longer meeting Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze. The material is heavy enough that he struggles with it, but Lan Wangji feels too frozen in place to reach out and help as he ought to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI sort of figured that I would be the one to,\u201d Wei Wuxian rambles as the expensive red silks crumple to the floor, far more crudely than they should be handled. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not supposed to hurt all that bad, if it\u2019s \u2014 if we \u2014 if you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stripped to his inner robe, Wei Wuxian sits on the bed with a hard thunk and looks anywhere but Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji still hasn\u2019t moved. He\u2019s hardly blinked since Wei Wuxian started undressing. His hands hang wooden at his sides. He\u2019s still standing by the bed, fully dressed in each of his layers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns, for just a moment, to assess what\u2019s been left for them by the bedside. Various unmarked oils, mostly. He is only vaguely familiar with visual references of intercourse with a man, although the mechanics seem intuitive enough. A few weeks before his wedding, he had been perfunctorily walked through the expectations of the marital bed by his xiongzhang, but it had been such a mortifying exchange that he\u2019d spent most of that educational session deafening himself by will, a high droning sound in his ears that drowned out Lan Xichen\u2019s uncomfortable instruction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns back toward the bed, where Wei Wuxian has repositioned himself to lie on his stomach, his knees tucked underneath him and his hips tilted slightly up as though in invitation. His hair, slung over his shoulder, is shiny and soft with perfumed oil, unbound now from its elaborate styling and pinnings. He had turned over casually enough onto his front, but Lan Wangji can see that his fingers are flexing in and out of the covers, a nervous tic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In those earlier days, there had been...lapses, lapses which Lan Wangji is ashamed to admit to, in which he\u2019d envisioned something similar to this. Claiming Wei Wuxian by force, holding him down and taking him apart until he broke, until he cried with misery. He\u2019d thought it was anger toward Wei Wuxian\u2019s misbehavior before he realized it was something else entirely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But presented with the actuality of it, he...those thoughts had only been\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want Wei Ying to fear him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey, um, they gave me this,\u201d Wei Wuxian says into Lan Wangji\u2019s long silence, and holds up something he\u2019d apparently been keeping tucked in a pocket. \u201cThey said it would help make it...easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t recognize the medicine, but he can guess its properties all too well. Someone, likely one of the GusuLan\u2019s physicians, had given him an aphrodisiac. Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t taken it. Not yet, at least. Strangely, it feels like a relief. It also feels like an indication of Wei Wuxian\u2019s reluctance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first time, Lan Wangji notices that the sheer silk of Wei Wuxian\u2019s inner robe clings wetly to the insides of his thighs. Someone must have...prepared him, directly before this. Or they had directed Wei Wuxian how to do it himself. Lan Wangji can feel his heartbeat in his mouth, in the tips of his fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian had studied at the Cloud Recesses, they had been equals \u2014 if not in status, then in everything else. Wei Wuxian had matched him blow for blow in fights, kept pace with him on night hunts; had far outpaced him in wit. Within the first few days of knowing him, Lan Wangji had realized, with no shortage of indignation at the time, that Wei Wuxian was smarter than him. He was smarter than everyone, and he knew it, and he wore that knowledge with a breezy assuredness; cocky with no patronization. He didn\u2019t believe he was better than everyone else by some inherent stake to a claim. Not like Jin Zixuan, not like Wen Chao, or even like Jiang Wanyin. He was like no one Lan Wangji had ever met, growing up in the gentries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To have Wei Wuxian brought to him like this as a servant, like \u2014 like cattle trotted out for breeding \u2014 Lan Wangji feels something in his stomach twist unpleasantly, close to nausea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His voice is so quiet, so rough that he hardly recognizes it. \u201cThere will be no...need for that, tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian cranes his head to blink at him in surprise. Then he straightens up, propping himself up on the bed with his hands and twisting to face Lan Wangji. \u201cBut we have to. Those are the rules. Aren\u2019t they? That we have to\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian glances away, gnawing on his lower lip and his cheeks pinking. So, not as entirely shameless as believed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian resumes, a little unsteadily, \u201cConsummate, to legitimize the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will not be necessary,\u201d Lan Wangji says again. Their marriage has been legitimized in every way that matters to his sect traditions. He will not impose such an act on Wei Wuxian when he is unwilling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian watches him uncertainly for another moment, pinching his lower lip between his fingers and worrying it against his teeth. He looks so soft like this, bare and gold-spun by candlelight, his hair loose over his shoulders and his inner robe peeking open. Lan Wangji has wanted him before, against all of his better judgment, but this configuration of it feels strangely new. Husband. He carefully tests the weight of the word. As a child, Lan Wangji could never even begin to picture marriage for himself, but now that Wei Wuxian is in front of him, packaged in wedding-red, he can imagine no one else, no other outcome. His husband. So strange, the shock and novelty of it, the low thrill of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess if you say so,\u201d Wei Wuxian eventually says. Then he frowns and adds petulantly, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not because you think I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, Lan Wangji has little doubt of that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I\u2019m too weak to take it or something,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, looking more rankled by the second, as though Lan Wangji had genuinely implied such a thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For just a moment, a selfish free-fall of a moment, Lan Wangji lets himself envision it. It would be so simple to give in, to slowly strip away that last layer separating them, or to ruck up the fabric over Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips. Wei Wuxian would not say no, no matter his personal misgivings \u2014 he has made that clear, at least. All of that skin, the flex of his thighs, the curve of his neck and shoulders. The wet heat of him, virgin-tight. The hunger of it beats faintly in Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach, a hollowness that wants to consume.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks of Wei Wuxian, stiff with awkwardness and discomfort while Lan Wangji fucks him. He thinks of looking Wei Wuxian in the eye the morning after, the first dawn of the rest of their shared partnership, and knowing what they\u2019d done had been nothing but a painful, unwanted inconvenience, a mandatory rite of passage. No.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, sudden and firm enough that Wei Wuxian startles. \u201cThe day has been long. Let\u2019s rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He steps away from the bed and turns, his back facing Wei Wuxian as he disrobes, layer by meticulous layer. It would be more customary for his new husband to undress him, but the thought is far too uncomfortable, given what had just transpired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s down to just his innermost robe, Lan Wangji turns to find Wei Wuxian watching him from the bed. He still looks a little lost, his mouth parted in a tiny <em> o</em>. Lan Wangji hesitates, then walks toward the bed, reaching up to untie his ribbon as he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian says as Lan Wangji slips into bed next to him. He wriggles down deeper into the covers, batting away some of the dried fruit and petals with a yawn. He seems to have relaxed, now that imminent sex is off the table. \u201cI finally got to touch that earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gestures toward the ribbon, which Lan Wangji has already folded carefully to place by his pillow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is meant to be touched only by family and spouses,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. Which. Wei Ying is, now. His...spouse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reaches out to run a curious finger along the firm material, and Lan Wangji tries to ignore the lurch of strangeness at the image, a reflex against someone else touching what he has guarded closely since he was a child. Strangeness, yes, and a shiver of something else he cannot name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I use it however I want to now?\u201d Wei Wuxian wonders aloud. \u201cLike, can I use it to clean out food that gets stuck between my teeth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels his lips thin in exasperation, and he rolls onto his back so that he faces the ceiling. \u201cGood night, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian echoes, then fidgets for several more minutes beside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the sound of it, neither he nor Lan Wangji sleep for a long time after that.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji wakes the next morning, the bed next to him is empty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It always is, when Lan Wangji wakes. But this is not his bed. The slant of sunlight is all wrong, the sheets a different color and the pillow uncomfortably stiff against his neck. It takes him a few seconds before the events of the previous day roll over him, and it\u2019s startling enough that Lan Wangji sits up. Yesterday\u2019s proceedings had transpired so quickly that it still feels dreamlike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But his new husband is not here. Wei Wuxian had overslept and lagged late to class every day of the summer he\u2019d studied in the Cloud Recesses, but now, at the break of dawn on the first day of their married life, he\u2019s nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s ribbon is still folded next to his pillow, visibly untouched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice says, to his right. \u201cYou\u2019re awake! Lan Zhan, isn\u2019t it poor form to sleep until all hours of the day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns to tell him, on droll reflex, that it is exactly mao shi, but once he looks at Wei Wuxian, he forgets what he\u2019s going to say entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, they took my usual clothes,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, to Lan Wangji\u2019s stare. \u201cBefore the...before I came here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That Wei Wuxian is already dressed and ready for the day is a surprise in and of itself. But even more startling is that he\u2019s clad in pristine white hanfu, sky-blue clouds threaded on the sleeves \u2014 GusuLan robes. The quality of the material is a tier above what the servants wear, but still subpar to the fineries of Lan Wangji and Lan Xichen. A subtle reminder that though they are married partners, Wei Wuxian is meant to be viewed beneath him. Lan Wangji has never seen Wei Wuxian without a hectic crop of bangs flying into his face; it\u2019s strange to see his hair parted neatly down the middle, bangs pinned neatly back. The red hair ribbon is long gone. A light blue one takes its place, accentuated by a white hairstick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks...Lan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre they,\u201d Lan Wangji begins, horrifically stilted. He has no idea how to do this \u2014 how to be a husband, how to engage with Wei Wuxian within their new arrangement. \u201cAre you...comfortable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian opens his mouth quickly to speak, then shuts it, like he\u2019s thought better of answering. He hesitates, then says with careful formality, \u201cThe GusuLan have been very kind to me. I appreciate the gift of these new robes and my new sect\u2019s hospitality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, that isn\u2019t right. Lan Wangji\u2019s heart knocks too quickly in his chest, that same twisty feeling as the night before settling low and acidic in his stomach. There had been a time in which he would have liked nothing better than Wei Wuxian\u2019s compliance, for his behavior to model that of a Lan\u2019s. He had not expected the reality of it to feel so unwelcome.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is quiet for the rest of the day once they return from their bridal chamber to the jingshi, dutifully copying lines or reading through scrolls that Lan Wangji would know, even from one day of Wei Wuxian\u2019s acquaintance, that he cannot stand. Lan Wangji holds his breath around him, steering clear and allowing him any distance he may need.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another day of this follows: Wei Wuxian holding himself unobtrusively, treading lightly, too polite. There are a few times, seated at the jingshi\u2019s table or meditating, when he starts to squirm, when he opens his mouth with a petulant expression as though to complain to Lan Wangji, and then his jaw clicks shut and a flutter of some indecipherable emotion crosses his face, and he goes back to whatever he was doing with renewed focus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji notices it because of how closely he watches him. Every moment he\u2019s not absorbed in a task, he\u2019s watching Wei Wuxian. Through his lashes, from under his eyebrows, in the corner of his eye. Wei Wuxian\u2019s presence had once been too loud for any contained space. But the third day is the same peaceful quiet; Wei Wuxian rises like a ghost in the morning at mao shi, eating what he\u2019s given without complaint, then sleeping in the evening when Lan Wangji does, even though Lan Wangji hears him fidgeting awake in their bed for at least a shichen after.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then another day, just the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their dynamic before had been reflexive, Wei Wuxian teasing, taunting, torturing; Lan Wangji a reactionary, reproach and order. He isn\u2019t sure what to do with a Wei Wuxian who is suddenly not Wei Wuxian. With a Wei Wuxian who belongs to him in every proper sense, but has never felt so far from reach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the morning of the fifth day, Lan Wangji tells him, \u201cCome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pokes his head up from where he\u2019d been half-dozing, nodding toward sleep over a text on ethics. \u201cCome where?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have errands to run in Caiyi Town,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cIf Wei Ying would prefer to accompany me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The premise of the outing is not quite the truth, but it\u2019s not a breach of the sect rules, either. Lan Wangji will just have to make something up to do, once he\u2019s in town, and the statement will be an honest one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even if it were to break the rules, it would be worth it for the way Wei Wuxian perks up at the suggestion, like a crack of sunlight through a cloud cover, and scrambles up off the floor to follow him out the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first order of business is a tailor. Lan Wangji has known Shen Xu since he was a child, as he and his xiongzhang have had several articles of clothing mended or bought to him in Caiyi over the years, and so he trusts his craftsmanship closely. His shop is the first place he brings Wei Wuxian, near the entrance of the main market in Caiyi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi,\u201d Shen Xu says with a short salute and a smile of recognition at Lan Wangji\u2019s arrival. \u201cWhat can I do for you today? I just received a set of new silks from Hangzhou; perhaps a new zhiju for the summer season?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Shen-xiansheng,\u201d Lan Wangji replies. \u201cBut no. I would like to see him fitted.\u201d He inclines his head slightly in Wei Wuxian\u2019s direction, who takes the cue to shuffle into Lan Wangji\u2019s personal space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Shen Xu peers at Wei Wuxian doubtfully, noting the Lan robes and clearly failing to recognize him. \u201cLan er-gongzi brought a friend, I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji begins, and his mouth goes stiff, the words paralyzed even as they take form. <em> My husband. My husband, my husband. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Wei Wuxian pipes up with a small bow, sparing Lan Wangji the embarrassment of that temporary lapse. \u201cCourtesy name Wuxian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shen Xu limps toward Wei Wuxian before he begins to circle him, sizing him up with a years-trained keenness. He lays light, measuring touches on the breadth of Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders, his narrow waist. \u201cAnother set of hanfu like these, Lan er-gongzi? I can improve their look significantly. Perhaps some silver thread accents with the blue \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says again. \u201cThree sets of hanfu in black, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shen Xu turns to give Lan Wangji a quizzical look; Wei Wuxian\u2019s head snaps toward Lan Wangji, his eyes round with surprise and his mouth falling open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shen Xu recovers from his confusion smoothly. \u201cBlack hanfu are in shorter supply on-hand, but it should not be undoable, Lan er-gongzi. I estimate it will take a week before I can make something exactly to Wei-gongzi\u2019s measurements.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA week will suffice,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWhat do you have in stock that can be sold today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is still staring at Lan Wangji with stunned uncertainty, his arms held at wingspan so Shen Xu can gauge their length.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust two, at the moment, that fit Lan er-gongzi\u2019s request,\u201d Shen Xu says apologetically. \u201cThey might be too big for him, around the waist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry them,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then looks away as Wei Wuxian is whisked away to be fitted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian emerges half a joss stick later, he cuts a similar figure to how Lan Wangji remembers him, the few times they\u2019d reunited outside of summer classes. Sleek, fitted black from head to toe, a leather belt cinched tight around his hips to hold the too-loose material. A little too roomy in the shoulders, not enough red or gray accents, but seeing him this way eases something in Lan Wangji, some inner disturbance that had been pinching at him like a splinter between his fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Wei Wuxian says with more spirit than Lan Wangji has heard in days. He jokingly performs a spin, the tails of his robes flying as he cheeses a smile at Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks very handsome. Wei Wuxian always looks handsome. Of course, Lan Wangji cannot say as much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThese will do until I return next week,\u201d Lan Wangji tells Shen Xu instead of answering Wei Wuxian\u2019s question, and reaches into his sleeve for his money purse. \u201cGray and red accents for the new sets.\u201d He pauses, and then adds, \u201cA red hair ribbon today, if you have it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moments later, Wei Wuxian scampers out of the shop ahead of Lan Wangji, his hands clasped behind his back and the red streak of his new hair ribbon bouncing with his steps. He turns to look at Lan Wangji over his shoulder, a smile breaking across his face and his eyes shining.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> There he is, </em>Lan Wangji thinks, and feels something in his chest twang.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is unbridled here, away from the silent and encroaching eyes of the Cloud Recesses. The lingering, enclosing quiet of the mountain air that seems to cling to him \u2014 it dissipates entirely as Wei Wuxian plunges into the teeming, chattering bustle of the market, immediately at home among the throngs of strangers in a way Lan Wangji has never been nor ever could be. He flits from stall to stall like a frantic sparrow, sampling whatever food is within reach, feeling different cloth swatches between his fingers and eagerly conversing with shopkeepers. Lan Wangji silently pays Wei Wuxian\u2019s way in his wake as he tears a meteoric path through Caiyi, content to watch him from a few paces behind. Content to watch him enjoy himself, for the first time since they\u2019d gotten married on that strange, strained day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji finally does catch up, after a few moments of attempting to relocate him in the heavy bustle of people, he finds Wei Wuxian in the middle of an argument with one of the vendors. The other man is red in the face, which is never a promising sign where Wei Wuxian is concerned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 hadn\u2019t set such a ridiculous price for it,\u201d Wei Wuxian is saying hotly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you are unwilling to pay the set cost, gongzi,\u201d the seller replies with icy scorn, \u201cthen I suggest you move along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian calls out when he sees him, and Lan Wangji is reluctantly towed into the fray as Wei Wuxian hauls him forward by his sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At once, the vendor\u2019s eyes widen in recognition and he salutes with a stammered \u201cLan er-gongzi.\u201d Wei Wuxian folds his arms smugly across his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve met my husband,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, deliberately drawing out the word. The vendor\u2019s eyes bug. \u201cLan Zhan ah, Lan er-gege, tell this man how unreasonable he\u2019s being, swindling his customers like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the vendor had been goggling before, the pet name makes his eyes fit to fall out of his skull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not act unruly,\u201d Lan Wangji tells Wei Wuxian quietly. Wei Wuxian sulks and throws an elbow onto Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, leaning his weight into him and sucking a displeased sound against his teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologize for my husband\u2019s untoward behavior,\u201d Lan Wangji tells the other man with a slight bow, and Wei Wuxian straightens up and makes an indignant sound. \u201cI will pay whatever price has been set.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe started it!\u201d Wei Wuxian complains as the man bows again, mumbling thanks over and over as Lan Wangji drops the appropriate coinage into his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines at him the moment they\u2019re out of earshot. \u201cYou really couldn\u2019t have given me some face there? You couldn\u2019t have defended your husband in front of that mean old uncle?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not sow discord among others,\u201d Lan Wangji recites, nowhere near harsh enough to be fully reproachful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAiyo, aiyo,\u201d Wei Wuxian sighs, slinging himself into Lan Wangji\u2019s side again. \u201cThis married business is hard. Who is left to defend my honor, my virtue, if not my betrothed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has made it an active point to not consider anything regarding Wei Wuxian\u2019s...virtue. Still, underneath the melodramatic moaning and masking, he gets the sense that he\u2019s genuinely offended Wei Wuxian, perhaps even hurt his feelings, by taking a stranger\u2019s side over his. Had it been a misstep? Is it an unspoken rule in marriage to always take the side of your spouse, no matter the fault in the situation?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is still feeling his way blindly in the ways of marriage. He has no context for it, not in the way that others with living parents do. That being the case, it\u2019s only inevitable that Lan Wangji will make errors, where his new husband is concerned. But small mistakes like this can be rectified. Surely he can...make amends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly, and passes his money pouch into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks, his eyes widening down at it. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever is mine is now yours,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then swallows and frowns as he feels heat creep up his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTian ah, I\u2019m rich,\u201d Wei Wuxian exclaims, then his mouth splits into a wide, roguish grin. \u201cLan Zhan, you never used to be so soft before. Do I just need to cry every time I want something from you now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head, not sure whether to be more flustered or irritated at allowing himself to be conned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian winks at him, then bounds off with a flip of his ponytail, vanishing into the crowds again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji manages to detain Wei Wuxian from draining the rest of the GusuLan coffers, but he suspects it has less to do with his influence and more with the fact that Wei Wuxian had eaten his way through half of the town and cannot consume anything else without getting sick. Lan Wangji leads Wei Wuxian to a spot along the shore of Biling Lake, far enough removed that they won\u2019t be disturbed, but near enough that they can still feel the pulse of crowds moving, the murmur of overlapping voices and the shouts of vendors selling their wares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian flops onto his back in the grass, moaning and rubbing a hand over his distended belly. \u201cLan Zhan, why did you let me eat so much? I look pregnant!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji purses his lips and glances away toward the water, resolutely ignoring whatever strange stirring he feels at that provided image.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this point in the afternoon, the sun beams hot onto the mossy green surface of the water, churned brown and swollen by recent rain. The heat off the lake hangs heavy like a murk, a dampening humidity. Boats drift past, fishermen hollering in distorted snatches to one another around the movement of their oars. Their voices catch and carry easily across the surface of the water, the dialect of Lan Wangji\u2019s childhood. The last time he and Wei Wuxian had been here together, the atmosphere had not been so serene. There had been water ghouls, a seething maw bubbling in the center of the lake pulling everything in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not so, now. Lan Wangji closes his eyes and tilts his face toward the sun, allowing himself the luxury of drowsing. The sun\u2019s warmth sinks beneath his skin, a golden lull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWon\u2019t your elders be angry?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks to break the quiet, and when Lan Wangji turns his head, he\u2019s fiddling with his belt to tighten it. \u201cWhen they see me dressed like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they are, they can approach me with it,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He pictures Lan Qingsheng\u2019s face and finds himself viscerally irritated by the thought. It should be no one else\u2019s business what Wei Wuxian wears. Wei Ying is his husband \u2014 his to protect and his to reproach, if the need exists. If someone has an issue with him, they will withstand Lan Wangji to do it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He leans back onto his elbows, spreading his legs so they sprawl. \u201cYou\u2019re not...aha, I\u2019ll confess, today isn\u2019t what I expected. You\u2019re not what I expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit properly,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and Wei Wuxian quickly straightens up before he tosses Lan Wangji a sullen look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He maintains the posture for a couple minutes before he gives up, slithering back onto the ground to lie flat on his back. He closes his eyes into the sunlight and tips his chin up, his dark lashes brushing his cheeks. He looks so appealing like this, sprawled and languid and his arms above his head, his slim waist. Black suits him, Lan Wangji thinks, and swallows despite the dryness of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know Lotus Pier is expecting me back in a month,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, stretching his arms further above his head and wriggling his hips a little. \u201cI think the Jiangs are expecting me to tell them I\u2019m carrying our firstborn son, in which case they\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says sharply. In their time apart, he has somehow managed to forget the extent of Wei Wuxian\u2019s flippant vulgarity, and his own intolerance for it. In spite of himself, a flustered heat prickles at the back of his neck at the image Wei Wuxian has provided; that same odd, perverse tug as moments before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only kidding, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, an amused glint in his eye as he observes Lan Wangji\u2019s reaction. He\u2019s still on his back, relaxed and wanton. \u201cI don\u2019t have the parts for that, so you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about knocking me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Crass. Shameless. Lan Wangji gets to his feet, clearing the dust from the back of his robes as he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait, don\u2019t leave just yet,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, the humor gone from his voice. He sits up to grab for Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist, and Lan Wangji tries not to flinch away from the touch. \u201cCan we stay here just a few minutes longer? I like sitting by the lake with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares down at Wei Wuxian, the dancing flash of his eyes and the curl of his lips, and attempts to detect any teasing. There\u2019s none he can find, only an earnest entreaty for his time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tugs his wrist free from Wei Wuxian\u2019s grip and resumes his seated position, his legs crossed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch things should not be spoken of,\u201d he says a moment later. \u201cIt isn\u2019t proper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian huffs a sigh and wriggles closer to him. He smells sweet and smoky from the market, something like fried bread.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cDo you wanna go swimming with me? It\u2019s so hot out; the water would be perfect right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere?\u201d Lan Wangji says, unable to keep the incredulity from his voice. There are so many people milling around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shrugs one shoulder. \u201cSure. Why not? Here\u2019s no different from anywhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The image of it is so preposterous: Lan Wangji, stripping down to his inner-robe or less in front of all of these strangers. Wei Wuxian, doing the same, where anyone can see him. Wei Wuxian, who apparently does such a thing often.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and points with his chin out toward the lake. He\u2019s sitting close to Lan Wangji\u2019s side, nearly hugging his shoulder with his chest. \u201cThey\u2019re selling loquats on the water. I could swim over there and get you a whole basket! I\u2019d tell them it was for my lovely wife, who\u2019s awaiting my return with desperate longing on the shoreline, and then they\u2019d ask, \u2018Which one is she, gongzi?\u2019, and I\u2019d point you out and say \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and Wei Wuxian sulks and goes back to lying on his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not gonna swim by myself.\u201d He sniffs, petulantly rubbing his hand against his nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been so cruel rejecting me like this, even when we would go to Cold Spring. One day, Lan Zhan, I\u2019m going to convince you to go with me.\u201d He cracks open an eye to appraise Lan Zhan with sudden doubt. \u201cYou <em> can </em> swim, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lan Wangji says irritably. This is how Wei Wuxian gets others to do what he wants; baiting people to prove themselves, until they\u2019re irritated enough to spite him. It has been an admittedly effective technique against Lan Wangji in the past, but it won\u2019t work today.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Wei Wuxian yawns, then closes his eyes and says nothing for a very long time, and when Lan Wangji glances over, he finds Wei Wuxian fully asleep, his arm slung partially over his face to block the sun\u2019s glare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lets him rest for an unmeasured amount of time, allowing him to sleep off the food he\u2019d consumed. He meditates in the meantime, so deeply that when he cracks his eyes open, the sun has shifted positions in the sky, low and amber. Wei Wuxian has lapsed from a light doze into a deep sleep, his mouth slack and his skin a little pink from so long in the sun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wakes him, and they go home. As they do, Lan Wangji tries not to notice, with each step closer to the Cloud Recesses, how Wei Wuxian bricks himself in by barely noticeable degrees. A smoothing-over, a dullness. He tries not to, but he does anyway.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>About a ten-day after their wedding date, his xiongzhang comes to check on him. Lan Wangji meets him on the jingshi pavilion following a long day of sect work, and they maintain a companionable quiet as they head up the steps and through the jingshi\u2019s sliding doors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow have things fared with Wei-gongzi your first week?\u201d Lan Xichen asks just as the door slides open, and then there\u2019s a long, silent pause as they both survey the state of the jingshi in shocked dismay. His husband is nowhere to be found, off cavorting somewhere in one of the nearby towns, but even his absence is the loudest thing in Lan Wangji\u2019s home, his belongings strewn in every which way. Wei Wuxian\u2019s newly acquired black robes are crumpled and tossed over the bed, the rest of them tangled up with the pristine order of Lan Wangji\u2019s, which have been neatly pressed and selected in advance for the week. Unfamiliar scrolls and books are scattered across Lan Wangji\u2019s desk next to an upturned inkstone and a scorch-mark that hadn\u2019t been there before. A sheaf of loose talisman papers flutters like leaves around the jingshi, dislodged by the wind through the cracked window. Wei Wuxian\u2019s unfinished breakfast has been left cold on the table, half-eaten. A note in Wei Wuxian\u2019s irredeemable scrawl is pinned to the jingshi\u2019s sliding door that reads: <em> Back soon, husband! </em>\u263a\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wearily rubs a thumb against his temple.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see you so happy, didi,\u201d Lan Xichen says, and to Lan Wangji\u2019s disbelieving glance, he merely smiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That evening, when Wei Wuxian comes home, Lan Wangji has cleared most of his mess and has fully prepared a reproachful speech about the importance of maintaining cleanliness, and respecting a shared living space \u2014 both precepts that Wei Wuxian well knows, given his days of library copying. But the moment Wei Wuxian crashes through the door, the lecture loses any of its importance, somehow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian exclaims, then surveys the half-cleaned jingshi with his hands propped on his narrow hips. His face is streaked with dirt, gleaming with sweat, and he\u2019s considerably more sun-tanned from this morning, a little red along his cheeks and forehead. \u201cOh, I left you a mess, huh? Sorry about that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji could rebuke him, recite a handful of rules, tell him what exactly is expected of a Lan spouse. Instead, he hears himself ask, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d because suddenly, seeing Wei Wuxian after several shichen without him, and in such a state, he\u2019s curious to know about his day. He\u2019s spent so long alone that it\u2019s a strange novelty to have someone constantly present, filling the space with noise and color and movement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs dramatically, then reaches up to untie his hair, the red ribbon twisting free. \u201cAn older couple in the Yushan village requested my help in cleaning out their pond. They said I looked like I was young and had a good back, which are both true, so I couldn\u2019t exactly say <em> no</em>.\u201d To Lan Wangji\u2019s vague horror and immediate, unshakeable interest, Wei Wuxian shrugs off his outer robe, leaving it crumpled on the floor, and then he doesn\u2019t stop, one layer and then the next as he moves toward the latticed privacy screen, chattering all the while. He stops for a moment to say, from behind the screen, \u201cOh, did you draw this bath for yourself? I can wait!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Lan Wangji says quickly. He <em> had </em> drawn it for himself, but it\u2019s not important.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian suddenly ducks out from behind the screen to trample toward Lan Wangji\u2019s desk. He\u2019s just the red underclothes left, his forearms and his calves bare and golden-tan, both splotched with dry mud. Wei Wuxian keeps talking as he scribbles out a talisman, presumably to heat the water, while Lan Wangji watches him flit around the jingshi with a funny feeling in his chest, impossible to name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014 that, I think people assumed I was there to help, so I started getting requests from all over the place! I even had to shovel donkey shit, but these people were all so nice and grateful, so it was impossible to say no to them. Not exactly how I saw my career as a cultivator going, but I <em> also </em>didn\u2019t think I\u2019d end up married to you, so there have been a few wrenches in the plan, huh, Lan Zhan?\u201d He casually shrugs off his inner robe and slings it over the privacy screen. Lan Wangji is still three steps behind, the lecture utterly forgotten. He gets a quick glimpse of Wei Wuxian\u2019s strong shoulders, the sloping curve of his back before he vanishes behind the screen. A moment later, his dirty trousers join the robe from the other side of the screen. \u201cBut look at me, I\u2019m being so rude, doing all the talking. Lan Zhan, how was your day? Probably less smelly than mine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes Lan Wangji a second to find his words, after all of that. His response is measured and quiet. \u201cIt was okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hears Wei Wuxian pause, then the slosh of him getting into the bath. \u201cJust okay? What did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing interesting,\u201d Lan Wangji says. The conversation is not first-nature to him; he\u2019s never been encouraged to discuss such things, certainly not with someone who isn\u2019t family. \u201cTrade negotiations with the PingyangYao sect. Instructing two of the younger disciples.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you should come with me next time, if you don\u2019t have something important to do,\u201d Wei Wuxian says over the sounds of water moving in the tub. \u201cI can only imagine their reactions if I come back with Hanguang-jun in tow, hahaha! They might just put you to work, Lan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, and is surprised to find he is not entirely opposed to the idea. He has never done manual labor before, given his upbringing, but Wei Wuxian makes it seem nearly appealing. Warm, communal. Wei Wuxian makes a lot of things seem that way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian rounds the corner only a few moments later, his skin glowing pink as he wrings out his wet hair with his hands. He\u2019s wearing a loosely tied white inner robe, one of Lan Wangji\u2019s. It\u2019s a little too big on him, but not by much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that I borrowed one of your sleeping robes, do you?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, then without pausing for an answer, he picks up Lan Wangji\u2019s comb and begins to work it through the dripping dark silk of his hair. \u201cAll of mine are dirty right now. Also, your comb is a lot better quality than mine, really gets out all the knots, so I hope you don\u2019t care that I\u2019m borrowing that either.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\u201cIt\u2019s...fine,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He feels a little dazed, knocked flat by the cyclone of Wei Ying. He\u2019s never had to share any of his belongings before; he\u2019s certainly never had them seized by benevolent force.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After he finishes brushing his hair, Wei Wuxian traipses over to Lan Wangji\u2019s bed \u2014 <em> their </em>bed, Lan Wangji reminds himself \u2014 and sprawls himself out on it with all his limbs, heaving a contented sigh. He lies there for so long that Lan Wangji thinks he must have fallen asleep, but then Wei Wuxian blinks his eyes open and rolls onto his stomach, pushing his backside out in a quick, wriggling stretch. At this, Lan Wangji finally looks away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, collapsing flat onto the mattress again. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to bathe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens his mouth to answer, but Wei Wuxian plows on to ask, \u201cDo I snore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pauses for a moment, catching up to the question, then says, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cAre you lying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLying is forbidden.\u201d Lan Wangji hesitates, then admits, \u201cA little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth falls open in a dramatic gasp. \u201cDo I keep you awake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s answer is honest this time, at least.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian twists over onto his back and groans at the ceiling. Lan Wangji realizes the strange tug he feels at his mouth is a small smile threatening to form, and he quickly tucks it away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else do I do in my sleep that you haven\u2019t told me?\u201d Wei Wuxian demands, then rolls his head to peer at Lan Wangji accusingly. \u201cDo I kick? Do I drool? Do I <em> cling</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji protests. \u201cIt\u2019s no matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then settles down more peaceably, holding one of Lan Wangji\u2019s pillows close to his chest as he curls up. Then his eyes close, and he doesn\u2019t say anything else for a long time, his breaths evening out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at him, then gives a slow, bemused shake of his head. There\u2019s still dinner to be eaten, but for now, he lays a blanket over Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders and lets them both rest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, one of the elders, Lan Boqin, visits the two of them exactly at mao shi, his face blanched with anger. He spends the next undetermined length of time lecturing Lan Wangji about what\u2019s expected of a marriage as prominent as his, about keeping his husband in line, about sect disciplines Lan Wangji could recite forward and backward in his sleep. Wei Wuxian sits beside Lan Wangji in the main chamber, looking sleep-rumpled and a little like he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening but has committed to the ride.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe husband of Hanguang-jun cannot be seen <em> traipsing </em> all over the countryside,\u201d Lan Boqin fumes at the two of them, who both sit before him like chastised children. \u201cPerforming such ridiculous acts for commoners \u2014 what face will we have left?\u201d He jabs a finger at Wei Wuxian. \u201cEverything you do now reflects on the GusuLan and on Wangji. Did you stop to think of that, when you were tearing around like some wild creature?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has maintained a relaxed, tranquil expression throughout the conversation so far, clearly accustomed to weathering tirades from seniors, but Lan Wangji can see the tension in the way his knuckles are white in his lap, the clench of his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQianbei,\u201d Lan Wangji finally interjects at this. \u201cWei Ying understands the expectations. As do I. None but I reserve the right to rebuke him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cClearly you have not rebuked him enough,\u201d Lan Boqin says coldly. \u201cThis arrangement is already painful enough for our sect. Wangji, I beg you not to make it more difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith respect, Wangji must ask qianbei to leave,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, not entirely able to keep the ice from his own voice. \u201cWei Ying and I have a full day of duties to attend to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Lan Boqin says with a snap of his sleeve, and he strides out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t anger your elders,\u201d Wei Wuxian says the moment he\u2019s gone, and when Lan Wangji looks at him, his mouth quirks in a humorless smile. \u201cCertainly not on my behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Lan Wangji says, inclining his head slightly. \u201cFor the callous manner in which he spoke to you. He was inconsiderate enough to say such things with Wei Ying present.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waves an airy, dismissive hand. \u201cEh, let your elders come, one by one. As if I haven\u2019t endured a lifetime of it. What\u2019s a little more? Anything without a whip is welcome.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s intake of breath must be audible, the joke a little too heavy to land, because Wei Wuxian blinks, like he also realizes he\u2019s said something wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The day after that, and then the week, lapse similar to the first. Wei Wuxian remains quiet, behaved, and perfectly in reach. Lan Wangji can trace the physical evidence of his unhappiness by the day, and it whittles something hollow in him to know he has played a role in it. That he continues to do so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s then, after those first three weeks, that they depart for Lotus Pier.</p>\n<p>The journey takes a few days, faster on sword than by ground. They travel by sky during the day, then settle at inns for the three nights they\u2019re on the road, and the routine is the same each night: their pre-bed rituals apart from each other; separate baths; one-sided, rambling chatter from Wei Wuxian; and then sleeping on opposite sides of the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hasn\u2019t said a word about sex since their wedding night, so Lan Wangji surmises his instinct about his unwillingness had been correct. In their schooldays, Wei Wuxian had never shown any genuine interest in men, not beyond shallow flirting clearly intended to provoke Lan Wangji.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had not married Wei Wuxian to sleep with him, anyway. Lan Wangji had only done it to protect him from someone else taking advantage of him \u2014 forcing him into something unwanted. That had been the only reason, he tells himself over and over again. Whatever wayward urges he himself has due to his preference toward men, it shouldn\u2019t be attributed to Wei Wuxian.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There <em> is </em> a feeling Lan Wangji cannot entirely shake, though, when they\u2019re flying alongside each other: Whenever he chances a glance at his husband, Wei Ying has his face turned toward the sun, the wind rippling through his hair and a tiny, content smile curling his lips. His eyes are closed, his skin gilded by a spray of sunlight, and Lan Wangji can\u2019t tear his eyes away from him because every time he looks at Wei Ying, looking like that, he feels a twist of. Something.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has never visited Lotus Pier before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s only been to Yunmeng itself a couple of times, on night hunts with his xiongzhang. Growing up near the sea and the lakes of the Gusu district, he is more than accustomed to being surrounded by water, but Lotus Pier\u2019s lakes are still a startling novelty. There are simply so many of them, woven into the piers and the city markets and even between the buildings. The air here is thick with a swampy humidity, nothing at all like the clear, crisp air of the mountains, even at this time of year. The sun bakes relentlessly through his robes as they walk, the summer heat entirely inescapable even in the reprieve of shade.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lotus Pier\u2019s manor itself is also a small wonder. It\u2019s strikingly different from the home Lan Wangji knows, warm wood tones and scatterings of lotus ponds weaving between the structures, the loud bustle and activity of disciples unfettered by rules. The scent of florals, lotus and camellia, is thick enough to taste, almost overly cloying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even in less than a shichen of his visit, Lan Wangji begins to understand parts of Wei Wuxian he hadn\u2019t put names to before. He watches his husband closely in the corner of his eye, the upbeat bounce in his step and the way he seems to relax into his whole being the further they wend their way through Lotus Pier. It\u2019s an ease Lan Wangji has not seen in him since they married, even in Caiyi or traveling. It\u2019s the ease of being home. Lan Wangji takes a moment to wonder if he, himself, feels such a way about the Cloud Recesses. Ease is not the word he would use to describe it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They follow a stone-lined path toward a towering hall marked Sword Hall, Wei Wuxian leading the way with barely suppressed eagerness. Several young disciples are practicing forms in the courtyard, drenched in sweat. The moment they see Wei Wuxian, they drop their practice swords and descend on him with surprised shouts and joyful cries of \u201cDa-shixiong, da-shixiong!\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter is high and infectious; Wei Wuxian laughs with his whole chest, with every part of his body. It fills an entire space like the melt of sugar in a hot pan. Lan Wangji watches from a short distance away, feeling not quite unwelcome but certainly out of place. Warmth flares in him anyway, watching Wei Wuxian\u2019s unbridled joy as he romps with the younger disciples, pinches their cheeks and pokes at their growing muscles and remarks on their improved skills. They flock around him in an adoring circle, their eyes wide and shining with admiration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is what Lan Wangji has taken from him. He reminds himself, again, that he\u2019d hardly had a choice \u2014\u00a0that if it hadn\u2019t been him, it would have been someone else. But he can\u2019t help the guilt that prickles at him, seeing Wei Wuxian so openly adored, as he thinks of the treatment his husband has received within his own sect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, Wei Wuxian appears to remember his existence; he blinks over at Lan Wangji, then gives a dazzling smile with all his teeth and eagerly waves him over. Lan Wangji goes, maintaining his refined posture even as some of the younger disciples shy away from him, clearly intimidated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my husband, Lan Wangji,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells the disciples. \u201cI know you <em> all </em> have heard of Hanguang-jun\u2019s legendary swordsmanship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The younger disciples nod and watch Lan Wangji silently, a little warily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDa-shixiong lives with Lan-qianbei now?\u201d one of the younger-looking disciples asks doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI live in the mountains now, all the way out in Gusu by the ocean! There are lots of mountain monsters there to fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen will da-shixiong return to Lotus Pier?\u201d the younger disciple asks, and Lan Wangji watches as Wei Wuxian\u2019s face shutters, his smile cooling and his brightness dimming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice cries out, ringing around the courtyard. Wei Wuxian\u2019s head snaps toward the sound. \u201cA-Xian, A-Xian!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli comes darting out of the hall, her pink and lavender silks swirling around her like butterfly wings. She would certainly be chastised for running in such a way in the Cloud Recesses, but Lan Wangji can\u2019t find it in him to judge her as Wei Wuxian sprints to his sister, sinking into her embrace so hard that her feet leave the ground. They rock back and forth for a moment, both of their eyes squeezed shut. Jiang Yanli is crying, just a little. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t believe he has ever encountered Jiang Yanli in an instance when she hasn\u2019t cried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian,\u201d Jiang Yanli says when she finally pulls away with wet eyes, one of her hands cupping Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou look so handsome! Clearly our friends in the GusuLan have been feeding you well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHardly!\u201d Wei Wuxian complains, and pats her hand. \u201cYou should see the rabbit food they eat there, shijie. When are you going to come visit and make me a year\u2019s worth of soup?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli laughs, and then her gaze slides past Wei Wuxian to refocus on Lan Wangji, who\u2019s still loitering uncertainly by the disciples. Lan Wangji has been expecting to be met with tension, maybe hostility, and is surprised when Jiang Yanli\u2019s eyes soften, a hand coming up to beckon to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi, welcome to Lotus Pier,\u201d she says as Lan Wangji nears the two of them. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you here. Thank you for taking such good care of A-Xian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShijie,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests. He folds his arms over his chest with a thump as he blows his bangs out of his face, his lower lip pouted. \u201cIt\u2019s more like the other way around. Lan Zhan would be helpless on his own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli glances at Lan Wangji again with sly amusement. \u201cIs that true, Lan er-gongzi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cVery true,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, if only for the way Wei Wuxian lights up at his teasing. \u201cI would be lost without him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clearly the right response; Jiang Yanli laughs, a warm, bell-like sound with a similar cadence to Wei Wuxian\u2019s, and she relaxes even further. Lan Wangji rarely has the correct response to conversational cues, and he\u2019s surprised by the pleased warmth he feels about it. For the first time, he feels as though he might have a place here, temporary though it may be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, come inside,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, looping her arm through Wei Wuxian\u2019s. \u201cA-Cheng is waiting anxiously to see you, although he\u2019s pretending that he\u2019s not, so don\u2019t tell him I said anything. The food just arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They curl close together as they walk, chattering happily while Lan Wangji follows behind in silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve barely set foot in Sword Hall before a shadow falls in the entryway, a palpable cold front sweeping through the hall. Yu Ziyuan emerges with her hands folded tightly in her sleeves, focused on Wei Wuxian with the same venom Lan Wangji remembers from the wedding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian falters a step back, his arm slipping quickly from Jiang Yanli\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-niang,\u201d Jiang Yanli murmurs, the warmth from her voice gone. She lowers her head and keeps it bowed, her eyes trained on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan ignores her, the scathing force of her gaze pinned on Wei Wuxian. \u201cI thought I felt Lotus Pier\u2019s doorstep darken. Who told you you were welcome back here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can scarcely believe the hatred in her voice. Even the strictest of his elders have never spoken to him in such a way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang-shushu wrote and invited me, Yu-furen,\u201d Wei Wuxian says respectfully. He also isn\u2019t looking at her, watching the floor closely. \u201cLan Zhan has never visited Lotus Pier, so it seemed only right to bring him to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan scoffs, turning to look critically at Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji lifts his chin and stares impassively back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you already grown sick of him, Lan er-gongzi?\u201d Yu Ziyuan asks Lan Wangji. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame you if you cast him out after a month. If you kick him out of the Cloud Recesses, send him elsewhere. We don\u2019t want him here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian keeps his eyes lowered, the line of his shoulders tense. Lan Wangji breathes carefully around the anger he can feel pulsing in the center of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the contrary, Yu-furen,\u201d he says. \u201cWei Ying\u2019s company has been welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Yu Ziyuan scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019d be the first to say it. We only kept him around as long as we did because no one else was taking strays.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-niang,\u201d Jiang Yanli interjects in a pleading tone, her head still bowed. \u201cPlease. A-Xian is only here for a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho taught you to talk back?\u201d Yu Ziyuan snaps, then directs her next words to Lan Wangji. \u201cSee the influence he has. Less than a shi back here and already my daughter is as uncouth as a servant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has never heard Wei Wuxian so quiet. He can feel his fingernails digging into his own palms, clenched tight enough to sting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s at that moment that Jiang Fengmian and Jiang Wanyin enter the hall. They pause in their tracks and their conversation, both visibly sizing up the tension in the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Jiang Wanyin squares his jaw and strides forward, past his mother, to envelop Wei Wuxian in a brisk hug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome back, asshole,\u201d he says, quiet enough for his parents not to hear. Wei Wuxian gives a small, strained laugh and pats his brother between the shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian,\u201d Jiang Fengmian says, also moving past Yu Ziyuan to greet them. \u201cLan er-gongzi, welcome. Have you not been offered tea? Come, come, there\u2019s some waiting in the next room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tea commences quickly and quietly from there, followed by a midday meal. It consists mostly of meat dishes reddened by spice, so Lan Wangji carefully picks his way around vegetable-based plates that won\u2019t disagree with him. Jiang Fengmian cordially asks them about life in the Cloud Recesses, and Lan Wangji lets Wei Wuxian do the talking, although his responses are more subdued than usual, one-sentence replies with no elaboration. At one point, Jiang Yanli moves a pork bun onto Wei Wuxian\u2019s plate, and Yu Ziyuan snaps at her for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is silent throughout the rest of the meal, speaking only when asked direct questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI see life in the Cloud Recesses has made A-Xian less inclined to chatter,\u201d Jiang Fengmian says at one point with a forced smile, clearly also noticing the shift.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan makes a scornful sound in her throat. \u201cAll the better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin is openly glaring at Lan Wangji, the rest of his meal untouched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive my lack of conversation, Jiang-shushu,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his tone polite. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long few days of travel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Fengmian waves the apology away. \u201cOf course. A-Xian and Lan er-gongzi must be tired. We won\u2019t keep you, if you\u2019d like to rest for the afternoon. Jinzhu and Yinzhu have prepared guest quarters for your stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not his old room?\u201d Jiang Wanyin interjects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem big enough to accommodate two,\u201d Jiang Fengmian replies. \u201cGuest quarters offer more privacy as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin makes a face at this, like he\u2019d rather not consider it. Out of the corner of his eye, Lan Wangji watches Jiang Yanli gently squeeze Wei Wuxian\u2019s knee, out of her mother\u2019s eyeline. Just as surreptitiously, Wei Wuxian squeezes back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan speaks up then. \u201cI was surprised to hear Lan er-gongzi had accepted my husband\u2019s proposal. Wei Ying has little to offer the GusuLan sect, so the arrangement seemed improbable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sets his chopsticks down with a quiet click. \u201cThe arrangement was advantageous to all involved parties. There was no reason to refuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan sneers across the table, but it\u2019s directed at Wei Wuxian. \u201cWei Ying is a servant\u2019s son with a scoundrel\u2019s track record. There was every reason to refuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have come to value Wei Ying\u2019s companionship,\u201d Lan Wangji says before he can stop himself. \u201cHis blood is of no consequence to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s chopsticks pause, suspended in mid-air. He turns to stare at Lan Wangji with a blank expression. Almost uncertain, like he isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s not being tricked. Lan Wangji returns to his lotus soup as he picks his way around the pork, his ears overwarm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat romantic notions you have about politics, Lan er-gongzi,\u201d Yu Ziyuan says, her tone conversational but her derision clear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSan niang,\u201d Jiang Fengmian murmurs, and Yu Ziyuan scowls in his direction. Jiang Yanli and Jiang Wanyin are focused with extreme intensity on sipping their tea, looking like they\u2019d rather shrink into the ground than sit here a moment longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect an esteemed cultivator from a fellow sect of the gentry to hold such untoward views on servants,\u201d Yu Ziyuan presses on. \u201cI always thought the GusuLan to be far more traditional. In my MeishanYu sect, such an arrangement would never be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Lan Wangji\u2019s many learned skills, repart\u00e9e is not one of them. He remains quiet as he chews, the lotus between his teeth acrid to the taste. The answering silence from the others seated at the table is stilted as everyone pointedly avoids eye contact.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI suggested A-Cheng for the partnership, given A-Li was already betrothed to Jin Zixuan,\u201d Yu Ziyuan continues into the awkward silence, more waspishly. \u201cBut my husband was insistent on giving this esteemed opportunity to Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-niang,\u201d Jiang Wanyin cuts in for the first time, sounding mortified.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d Yu Ziyuan snaps, and Jiang Wanyin nearly flinches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Cheng will focus on sect leadership, and then marriage,\u201d Jiang Fengmian says firmly. It\u2019s clear they\u2019ve had this argument before, perhaps several times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What Lan Wangji would like to say is that the entire conversation is a moot point. If the offer had been Jiang Wanyin, he would have refused. He\u2019s beginning to think that if the offer had been anyone else on earth besides Wei Ying, he would have refused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the meal is relatively painless and civil, compared to that exchange, and then he and Wei Wuxian are being shown their rooms by Yu Ziyuan\u2019s maids, brisk and unsmiling. Once they reach the guest chambers, the two women depart without a word. Wei Wuxian has lagged a few paces behind Lan Wangji, stopping at various distractions along the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian calls. Lan Wangji turns, and he finds Wei Wuxian watching him with a bemused expression. He quickens his steps so he\u2019s at Lan Wangji\u2019s side, tilting his head a little so his ponytail swings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for saying what you did in there,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI know Yu-furen can be \u2014 a lot, on a first meeting. But you really didn\u2019t have to go do all of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> All of what, </em> Lan Wangji wonders. It had only been true. He had hardly said enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats, still studying him with a thoughtful expression. \u201cI have to say, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re really not what I expected at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had told him the same thing not long ago, in Caiyi Town. Lan Wangji wonders if he should take it as an insult that Wei Wuxian\u2019s expectations of their marriage had apparently been so low.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did Wei Ying expect?\u201d he says. It comes out a little testier than intended.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian cocks his head, biting down on his lip and a smile in his eyes. \u201cWell, for you to ignore me, mostly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d Lan Wangji says coolly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian throws his head back and laughs with genuine mirth, clutching his sides a little as he does. Lan Wangji shakes his head and starts to move toward the door again, but Wei Wuxian slides into his path, blocking him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs it turns out,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues, his hands behind his back as he sways into Lan Wangji\u2019s space, their chests almost touching. \u201cLan Zhan is an exceptionally good spouse in addition to being very handsome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The compliment is a shallow one, no doubt intended to tease, but Lan Wangji gets hot at it anyway, clenching his jaw against a blush.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d he mutters, and takes a large step back to put space between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees easily. \u201cLan Zhan, let\u2019s go swimming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just looks at him and doesn\u2019t respond.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much else to do here when it\u2019s so hot out,\u201d Wei Wuxian wheedles. \u201cI want to show you the lakes. There are so many good ones, and it won\u2019t be anyone but us, so you don\u2019t have to worry about a bunch of strangers hanging around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens his mouth to refuse, and then he thinks, suddenly, of Wei Wuxian shrinking himself in Sword Hall, small and quiet and so like those first few days of their marriage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...fine,\u201d he hears himself say. Wei Wuxian brightens, his eyes widening with surprised delight. He had expected Lan Wangji to say no. It\u2019s odd, Lan Wangji thinks,\u00a0 that anything he does is capable of truly surprising Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, really?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, bouncing onto his toes. He reaches out to squeeze both of Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders, and Lan Wangji blames the damnable heat for how warm he feels, sweat gathering on his lip and under the thick curtain of his hair. \u201cThis is gonna be great! Oh, wait, I know just the one. It\u2019s not one of the more popular ones, so we won\u2019t be bugged by Jiang disciples or by other swimmers. Come on, come on!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And with that, Lan Wangji finds himself being tugged out the door by the sleeve, down the steps and into the sunlight of the courtyard.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s lake of choice isn\u2019t far, but it is a little secluded, as promised. They travel through a few li\u2019s worth of woods before the trees open up into a clearing. The lake here is hemmed in by rock cliffs, the waters a clear and startling shade of blue. The day is windless, so the surface of the lake barely ripples. It\u2019s as though they\u2019ve stumbled upon a sheet of glass, a pristine mirror to the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Wei Wuxian is \u2014 disrobing. Already.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know how hard it is to wear black around here in the summer?\u201d he complains, wriggling out of each layer so they crumple onto the ground. He almost trips taking off his shoes. His skin is flushed with heat, his limbs and hairline gleaming with sweat. Lan Wangji politely looks away as Wei Wuxian strips down to just his trousers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re not going to go swimming in all of your clothes, are you?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, sounding amused. \u201cI mean, that would be very like you, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Lan Wangji begins to reply, then makes the mistake of looking at Wei Wuxian while he does, and his tongue glues itself to the roof of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His husband\u2019s body is surprisingly toned, lean cords of muscle along his arms and chest, his abdomen. He has a swimmer\u2019s build, narrow hips and his shoulders a little lanky. A dark trail of hair dips into the waistband of his trousers. Lan Wangji has seen glimpses of Wei Wuxian\u2019s physique before \u2014 in Cold Spring, and in sharing quarters over the past few weeks \u2014 but never so directly, nor with a view so unimpeded. Fortunately, Wei Wuxian is in the middle of redoing his ponytail, his ribbon caught between his teeth as he works his fingers through his hair, so he doesn\u2019t notice Lan Wangji\u2019s sudden lapse, although he does turn to stare a little when Lan Wangji abruptly stops talking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Lan Wangji mutters, then looks off into the trees, trying to swallow down his embarrassment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t peek at you, if you don\u2019t want me to,\u201d Wei Wuxian says loyally, and Lan Wangji turns back to scowl at him in case he\u2019s being teased. \u201cI\u2019m serious! I\u2019m as straight-laced as an arrow, Lan Zhan. You won\u2019t find any untoward thoughts here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji eyes him skeptically. Wei Wuxian tilts his head cutely back at him, smiling with charming innocence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Menace</em>, Lan Wangji thinks with great weariness, and he begins to slowly unpeel his own sweat-damp layers, folding each one as he goes and placing them atop a flat rock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>True to his word, Wei Wuxian looks off toward the water for a few minutes, stretching his arms over his head. Then, being Wei Wuxian, he promptly forgets about it and turns toward Lan Wangji again once he\u2019s undressed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to show you \u2014\u201d Then he stops and stares at Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji stares back, prickling more with each second of scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Lan Wangji snaps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Wei Wuxian says quickly, still staring. \u201cYou just have a nice body. Like, a <em> really </em>nice body. I wasn\u2019t expecting \u2014 um, all of that, that\u2019s all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji huffs and faces the water again, his ears hot.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you get so mad when I compliment you?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cCan\u2019t married partners give each other compliments? Or is that against your 3,000 rules?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, then says, a little sullenly, \u201cIt is not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, good!\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI was just saying I want to show you something. Watch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s become increasingly impossible not to, Lan Wangji thinks, observing Wei Wuxian covertly from the corner of his eye. Wei Wuxian sets Suibian on the ground and fits his bare feet to the hilt, and then he\u2019s rising off the ground, spitting up sand as he goes. Wei Wuxian rides a sword with expert athleticism and a cocky ease, throwing his weight smoothly so he bobs and weaves. Now is no different even as he crouches a little for balance, speeding out toward the lake. He ascends higher and higher, and then, with his feet still attached to Suibian, he flips, three rotations, directly into the water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On instinct, Lan Wangji takes a step forward when Wei Wuxian vanishes into the blue, leaving only a bubbling wake behind. Several long seconds pass, and then Wei Wuxian bursts up with a splash, his peals of laughter bouncing off the water and shimmering against the cliff faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that great!\u201d Wei Wuxian calls over to him. He starts to paddle toward the shore, Suibian clutched in one hand. \u201cLan Zhan, come in already, the water\u2019s so nice!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sighs, then steps into the water so he\u2019s ankle-deep. It is a nice temperature, nowhere near the degree of Cold Spring\u2019s, but refreshing for a day as hot as this one. Wei Wuxian sends Suibian to the shore and treads water as he waits, spectating with clear humor as Lan Wangji picks his way along the lake bottom, careful to avoid rocks and branches. Finally, he catches up to Wei Wuxian, his feet leaving the lakebed to tread next to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji only ever uses Cold Spring for cultivation, meditation, or healing purposes; he has never swam there for fun, or even considered it. He hasn\u2019t swam for the simple sake of swimming since he was a child. It feels strange to bob in the lake without a real purpose, with only the water bearing his weight aloft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, wasn\u2019t that trick great,\u201d Wei Wuxian says again, clearly fishing for compliments. When Lan Wangji nods, he adds, \u201cJiang Cheng and I used to practice it all the time, when we could sneak away from training. We used to host these competitions with the other disciples to see who could pull off the best tricks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you win?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, drifting closer to Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBragging rights, mostly,\u201d Wei Wuxian replies. He lets himself float on his back, his limbs starfished outward. \u201cSometimes we\u2019d pool our money together and get a betting ring going, and the winner would take all. Jiang Cheng was <em> so </em> pissed whenever I beat him, which was <em> all </em>of the time. I\u2019d blow all my money on food and liquor like, right away, and Jiang Cheng would yell at me about saving it, the little shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hums for lack of better response, just to show he\u2019s listening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s always kind of thought about things like a sect leader,\u201d Wei Wuxian says to the sky. \u201cIt was sort of pounded into him when we were kids, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hums again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, am I boring you?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, splashing a little as he rights himself in the water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying could never be boring,\u201d Lan Wangji says dryly, and he means every word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian cracks a toothy grin, then moves toward him with a smooth stroke of his arms. Just as steadily, Lan Wangji retreats from him. It pushes them both backwards so that Lan Wangji\u2019s feet find the lake bottom again, cool mud squishing between his toes. Lan Wangji remains patiently still as Wei Wuxian circles him around and around in the water like a shark. Once Wei Wuxian is behind him, Lan Wangji feels hands press down onto his bare shoulders as Wei Wuxian throws his weight, doing all in his power to shove Lan Wangji underwater.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying!\u201d Lan Wangji protests, swatting him away and blinking spray out of his eyes. Wei Wuxian back-paddles with his feet and cackles, the sun-gold lines of his face alight with mirth. Watching him, feeling his heart skip as he does, Lan Wangji comes to the rather abrupt realization that he would do any manner of ridiculous and improper things to keep Wei Wuxian looking like that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But whatever Wei Wuxian sees in Lan Wangji\u2019s face in return causes some kind of shuttering. He blinks and straightens in the water, becoming more serious as he says, \u201cSorry, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not for the first time, Lan Wangji wonders what it was that was said to Wei Ying \u2014\u00a0when, and by whom \u2014 to instill fear that had never existed there before their marriage. He has his guesses, and it makes his knuckles curl at his sides.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s this line of thought that impels Lan Wangji to reach out, plant one hand on the top of Wei Wuxian\u2019s head, and forcefully dunk him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian comes up spluttering and hacking in shock. He blinks at Lan Wangji in pure disbelief, his mouth ajar as water drips down his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you really just!\u201d Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d says Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s face hardens with determination, a challenging smirk sharp against his cheek. It\u2019s an expression that signals danger, from personal experience on the receiving end of it. Before Lan Wangji can blink, Wei Wuxian flies at him, a wet <em> smack </em>and a grunt as their bodies collide, skin and muscle, Wei Wuxian\u2019s wiry arms wrapping around his waist to shove him back into the water. It\u2019s the surprise of it, more than Wei Wuxian\u2019s strength, that imbalances Lan Wangji; he stumbles, the soles of his feet sliding in the slimy algae on the lakebed, and Wei Wuxian very nearly takes him down. Lan Wangji is halfway distracted by the feeling of Wei Wuxian tangled up around him, laughing and laughing, the sound and closeness of him warmer than daylight. Lan Wangji had never roughhoused as a boy; had never even imagined doing such a thing, with his peers or with his xiongzhang. Infighting had been prohibited, and tactile play discouraged. He isn\u2019t sure what to do with his arms or his hands. He stands in the water as immovable as a boulder, awkward and stiff and burning as Wei Wuxian keeps trying to shove him off-balance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAiyo, Lan Zhan, give me some face, will you?\u201d Wei Wuxian whines, scrabbling ineffectively at Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLet me dunk you just once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, on some instinct, Lan Wangji gathers Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists easily in one hand and holds them above his head. Wei Wuxian\u2019s physical strength is not to be underestimated, but Lan Wangji is stronger, taller by a cun and wider by a few more. A thrill courses through him at how easy it is to overpower Wei Wuxian, even as his muscles ripple with effort, as he whines and thrashes and puts up a good fight to free himself from Lan Wangji\u2019s grip; almost a good enough fight. Lan Wangji has heard other men say that maidens\u2019 fragility, their vulnerability, is the quality that attracts them, but it\u2019s Wei Wuxian\u2019s physical strength that sparks something carnal in him, some hot pulse in the core of him that\u2019s impossible to temper. That threat of being outmatched and winning anyway; of Wei Wuxian giving as good as he\u2019s got, shoving Lan Wangji around before he inevitably loses, before Lan Wangji pins him and breaks him open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan,</em>\u201d Wei Wuxian protests harder as he struggles. He juts his lower lip out in a pout, pink and glistening with lakewater. Lan Wangji observes the thought, as though from a clinical distance, that he wants to bite it. \u201cSo beastly, so brutish! Is this how cruelly you treat all of your husbands?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, following the line of inquiry with an interested hunger. He tightens his grip around Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists, tight enough that Wei Wuxian squeaks <em> ah </em>in either pain or breathy surprise. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stops struggling for a moment, his eyes slightly round in his face. His skin is pinker now, beyond the sun-flush already reddening his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, with his wrists still pinned, he slinks under the surface of the water, blowing bubbles as he goes. Lan Wangji hardly has time to question it before Wei Wuxian surfaces, spitting a stream directly into Lan Wangji\u2019s face. It disarms Lan Wangji enough that he flinches back, his grip on Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists loosening as he blinks through water and \u2014 and Wei Wuxian\u2019s spit, the thought of which should not affect him either way \u2014 and his slip gives Wei Wuxian the opening he needs. Wei Wuxian crows in victory and pounces, tackling Lan Wangji into the water and taking them both down with a thundering splash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji crashes under, the sounds of the surface hollowing out into quiet, Wei Wuxian\u2019s limbs tangled up with his, Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair in his mouth, Wei Wuxian\u2019s thigh caught between both of his. There are too many points of contact to focus on; it\u2019s the most they\u2019ve touched, more than their wedding night, more than Lan Wangji has ever been touched at once, and he thinks, for a free, fleeting, floating moment, that he could stay here until his breath bottoms out, grip on tight to Wei Wuxian until they\u2019re one strange and conjoined form, away from the clamoring expectations above the surface \u2014 except then Wei Wuxian is pulling him up, hauling him toward the sun. Air splits over his head, the return of sound bursting around him. Lan Wangji chokes trying to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with fond concern, but he\u2019s laughing, laughing too much for genuine worry. He\u2019s scooping Lan Wangji\u2019s dripping hair out of his face. \u201cDid I almost drown my husband? Please don\u2019t report me for attempted mariticide, Lan Zhan, my reputation really can\u2019t withstand it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He says that more and more often now, breezy and thoughtless and half-facetious, <em> my husband, </em>like it\u2019s always been this way, like he\u2019d chosen it this way, like they\u2019re really\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian teases, Lan Wangji reminds himself with a steeling breath. Oxygen scrapes the bottom of his lungs. Wei Wuxian teases everyone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d Lan Wangji says. On instinct, he reaches up to adjust his headband before he remembers he\u2019d left it on the shore. \u201cYour family will be expecting us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian groans and sulks at him. \u201cSo easily conceding defeat, Lan Zhan? I never took you for a quitter!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji ignores him and begins wading back toward the shore. He hears Wei Wuxian splash around behind him before he follows with sighing and grumbled protests. Then he feels hands on his shoulders again, and the next thing he knows, Wei Wuxian is climbing him like a tree, surprisingly nimble, each of his limbs wrapping tight around Lan Wangji\u2019s torso and clinging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to throw him off, but Wei Wuxian only grips on tighter, cackling in his ear. Wei Wuxian\u2019s trousers are sheer and wet enough that Lan Wangji can feel something very distinct pressed against his back. Obviously Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t hard, but the shape of what he can feel is enough to make Lan Wangji\u2019s throat dry as a bone, his cheeks smarting with heat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hums and rests his chin on Lan Wangji\u2019s wet shoulder, still clinging onto him. \u201cDo you forfeit yet, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I do, will you get off of me?\u201d Lan Wangji replies through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think my husband should have to carry me like this everywhere,\u201d Wei Wuxian says primly, then gives a kick to his side like he\u2019s leading a horse. \u201cMy feet should never touch the ground again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he bites Lan Wangji\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stiffens, goosebumps rippling all the way up his back. At the same time, Wei Wuxian loosens his grip like he\u2019s been unbalanced, scrambling back into the water with a racketing splash.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says when he resurfaces, his eyes a little wide. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I \u2014 um! I got. Carried away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says stiffly, and wades his way back toward the shore. His earlobe is still burning where Wei Wuxian\u2019s teeth had sunk in. His entire body feels hot, in spite of the cool water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neither of them speak as they stumble back into their robes and their shoes. The whole scenario feels ridiculous now, in hindsight; that Wei Wuxian had somehow tricked him out of his clothes and into the water like some huli jing. Something for him to gloat about, perhaps. Heedless, as always, to leaving others in turmoil.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re not mad, are you?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks into Lan Wangji\u2019s silence. \u201cI was just messing around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMessing around,\u201d Lan Wangji echoes, his voice thin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, messing around,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThe way I\u2019d do with Jiang Cheng or Nie Huaisang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea of Wei Wuxian casually straddling Nie Huaisang\u2019s back makes Lan Wangji even angrier. He gives a snap of his sleeve and strides off toward the woods, with little to no direction as to where he\u2019s going but desperate to make a dignified exit regardless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, the manor is that way!\u201d Wei Wuxian calls, unable to keep the laugh entirely from his voice, and Lan Wangji\u2019s temper sours further. He turns to glare at Wei Wuxian, who falters and quits smiling when he sees the expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, sounding a little breathless. \u201cYou haven\u2019t looked at me this way since...did I really offend you so much?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lan Wangji says, unwilling to talk about it further. The more Wei Wuxian probes, the more it will become glaringly obvious that Lan Wangji\u2019s anger has no root in anything that makes sense to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says agreeably, and catches up to Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They pass the first couple of li in silence, twigs and leaves crackling under their wet shoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and scratches his head. \u201cI have a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bodes ill. Lan Wangji inclines his head to grant the request.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you could have had it any other way,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cWhat would your ideal wife be like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The question is unexpected enough that it almost shakes Lan Wangji out of his sulk. Almost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever pictured it before,\u201d Lan Wangji says, wishing to be away from this topic. \u201cI never thought overmuch about marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then maintains a pensive silence as they keep walking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A smatter of birdsong, wheeling and plaintive. A chorus of frogs and cicadas, burring loud as sunset approaches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if you tell me, whatever it is,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He is unmistakably earnest. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to be more like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns his displeasure, his former mood forgotten. \u201cNo need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it is!\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be sad your whole life because of me. That would be so selfish! I know I\u2019m exactly not what you, ah, pictured, and \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji interrupts. \u201cThere is no need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Wei Wuxian audibly pouts. \u201cI was just trying to be nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI never wanted a wife,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He immediately wishes he could take it back. It feels too close to an admission he does not want to make.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d says Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then swallows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian falls quiet again for a long time, his silhouette lined dark in the falling light. He appears to be thinking hard on something. Lan Wangji waits with breath bated for what he\u2019ll say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to get married,\u201d Wei Wuxian says slowly. \u201cEven though you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That is not what Lan Wangji had said. He had said he hadn\u2019t wanted a wife. He opens his mouth to correct Wei Wuxian, then shuts it again. Perhaps safer, this way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I promise,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He sticks up three fingers, the whites of his eyes visible even in the growing dark. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to make it not all bad, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji breathes out. The evening\u2019s first stars wink through the dark slivers in the trees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and they walk until the moon rises.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their stay in Lotus Pier passes surprisingly quickly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian devotes most of it to romping with his siblings, so Lan Wangji spends much of his time there alone. He doesn\u2019t mind. Lotus Pier has an extensive library \u2014 nowhere near the breadth of the Cloud Recesses\u2019, but with new and different materials \u2014 and beautiful sights, and the paths around the water channels are easily walkable. He has never minded solitude, and he can\u2019t begrudge Wei Ying at all for wanting to spend time with his family, especially when he returns to Lan Wangji in the evenings with a wine-flush in his cheeks, his eyes bright with happiness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later into their trip, Wei Wuxian returns to their shared quarters a little drunker than the previous nights, and he immediately makes a bid for Lan Wangji\u2019s attention \u2014 which, of course, he already has.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells the ceiling as he sprawls on the floor, his eyes closed. A faint smile curves his lips. \u201cDid you know I always really wanted to bring you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji did not know. It makes something in him go soft and warm. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian sighs, then he yawns. \u201cThat first summer, after we studied together. I kept hoping you would come visit me. And then I could show you around, just like this. I had all sorts of terrible things planned for you, just so I could laugh at you a little, but not \u2014 not in a mean way, I just. Missed laughing at you, when you weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, soft enough to prompt Wei Wuxian to continue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow it\u2019s all perfect,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re here and Jiang Cheng\u2019s here and shijie\u2019s here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They have three days left in Lotus Pier before they\u2019re expected home. Lan Wangji is sure Wei Wuxian is aware. It\u2019s perhaps, even, the reason for his inebriation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly, but Wei Wuxian is already asleep, his face still flushed and his head tilted to the side. He\u2019s childlike when he sleeps, even more so than when he\u2019s awake, a natural pout of his mouth and his cheeks a little puffed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is able to lift him easily to move him to the bed. He stares at Wei Wuxian's sleeping form for another moment, unimpeded now to drink his fill without being caught, before guilt gnaws at him with small teeth. <em> It is allowed, </em>he reminds himself. They are married. Is there something morally wrong with looking at one\u2019s husband? With caring for him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had toed off his shoes at the door, but Lan Wangji removes what else he can, moving with care so as not to wake him. His belt, which makes his face heat at the implications; he does not dare venture any further than that. His socks. His hair ribbon, which he places next to the bed. Lan Wangji has never been one to initiate touch with others. He\u2019d never had any desire to, avoiding physical contact even from family members.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Wei Ying, his hands are treacherous. They betray him to himself. They move of their own will, always unconsciously roaming or reaching out. He wants Wei Ying\u2019s skin and his warmth and the curve of his cheek against his mouth. He wants everything, and it is a cataclysm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns onto his back and watches the silver latticework of moonlight across the ceiling. He keeps his hands tucked close to his chest, and he burns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their visit is not all idyllic, of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan\u2019s presence lurks like a thunderhead, an ever-present bitter charge in the backdrop. Meals with the Jiangs are mostly silent, or strained with tension. Lan Wangji notices that Wei Wuxian stays out of her way, taking care to avoid being underfoot, but Yu Ziyuan seems to seek him out with uncanny precision, and it is always with a prepared diatribe or a sneer on her lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the last afternoon before their departure, Lan Wangji finds himself at the entrance of Sword Hall again, searching for Wei Ying, and realizes quickly that he\u2019s intruded on the tail-end of an argument. Perhaps not so much an argument as Yu Ziyuan berating Wei Wuxian \u2014 something about his conduct around the younger disciples \u2014 while Wei Wuxian stands there with his head lowered, a defiant jut of his jaw, his hands clenched by his sides. He says something in reply to Yu Ziyuan that Lan Wangji cannot hear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment Lan Wangji enters the hall is when Yu Ziyuan slaps Wei Wuxian so hard across the face that a crack rings around the room. It is not a light swat. Yu Ziyuan puts her whole arm into the blow, with such a force that Wei Wuxian stumbles, his neck wrenched to the side and his hair whipped into his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels his entire body flash hot, then cold, a crystallizing ice that spreads and burns. The reaction is instinctive, visceral. Before he knows what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s taking a step forward to announce his presence, his hand on the hilt of his sword.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If she\u2019s surprised to see him, Yu Ziyuan doesn\u2019t show it. She turns to survey Lan Wangji with evident disinterest. Her eyes drop to Bichen, then travel back up to Lan Wangji\u2019s face with a small, venomous smirk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it, Lan er-gongzi?\u201d she asks. \u201cHave you never seen a servant disciplined?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian walks quickly toward Lan Wangji, his head down and his eyes averted. He doesn\u2019t pause in his steps even as he grabs Lan Wangji\u2019s arm to pull him back toward the hall\u2019s entrance. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t budge. His hand hasn\u2019t moved from his sword. Neither he nor Yu Ziyuan have backed down from glaring at each other, a silent standoff that drops the room\u2019s temperature steadily by degrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says in a low voice, still facing the exit. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zidian flickers to life on Yu Ziyuan\u2019s hand, a violet crackle of electricity. At the sound, Wei Wuxian yanks his arm harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d he snaps, with a much harder edge than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yu Ziyuan would never dream of injuring Lan Wangji, for multiple reasons \u2014 his status, his sect background, their newly minted alliance. All three of them know this. It doesn\u2019t stop Yu Ziyuan from flexing her hand so that the snake on her wrist uncoils, a pointed reminder of the power she wields.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is only Wei Wuxian\u2019s palpable tension that prompts Lan Wangji to turn and follow him out to the pavilion. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t stop even once they pass their quarters, plowing forward with a single-minded focus until Lan Wangji tugs on his arm to stop him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian does, then turns to eye him warily. His cheek has already puffed up from the strike, the skin reddened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s hand drifts up automatically to touch, and then he remembers himself and returns it to his side. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers at once. \u201cReally, I\u2019m fine, Lan Zhan, I\u2019m not just saying that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it be better if we...\u201d Lan Wangji hesitates. <em> Go home </em>suddenly seems like the wrong thing to say. \u201c...left a day early?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, with something like panic. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t need to do that. I\u2019m really fine.\u201d He raises one hand to massage his jaw, then turns to the side to casually spit out a mouthful of blood. \u201cNicked my cheek, though.\u201d Then he beams at Lan Wangji. His teeth are red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his smile fading at the corners. \u201cReally, don\u2019t. It barely even hurt. It\u2019s much better that it\u2019s me than Jiang Cheng or shijie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, I mean it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, beginning to bristle. He is so rarely unsmiling. It\u2019s interesting to know, with each passing day of their marriage, what pushes Wei Wuxian to an edge, what shakes him out of fa\u00e7ade and closer to genuine reaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWill you show me the market?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian freezes in the middle of whatever he\u2019s charging up to say. For a few seconds, he blinks at Lan Wangji, looking flabbergasted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe market,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats. \u201cI would like to see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hasn\u2019t fully untensed, but curiosity seems to win out over his skepticism. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Well. Okay.\u201d Each word is punctuated with a blink. Wei Wuxian still looks a little wary, like he suspects this may be a pity outing. Lan Wangji has found, with increasing clarity, that Wei Ying reacts to pity in the visceral way that most would to insult or injury. By contrast, insult and injury find him with a smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every new thing he learns complicates his initial impression of Wei Ying, from those first few months. Complicates it, and\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, sure, if you really want to,\u201d Wei Wuxian is saying. \u201cLet\u2019s go now if we\u2019re going though, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The distance to the main market stretch isn\u2019t far, but Wei Wuxian\u2019s steps seem to grow lighter the further they wander from the manor. He\u2019s practically skipping by the time they reach the first set of stalls along the water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the vendors know Wei Wuxian by name, calling out in excited recognition when they see him. He doesn\u2019t ignore a single one; each time his name is called, he drags Lan Wangji over to meet whoever it is, to make chirping small talk or to toss flirtations their way like flower petals. Neither age nor gender seem to be discriminating factors for who catches and receives Wei Wuxian\u2019s attention. Lan Wangji has grown deeply sullen about it by the fifth blushing shopkeeper, by which point Wei Wuxian\u2019s arms are overflowing with fresh jujubes and loquats and bags of lotus seeds and water chestnuts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a tiny grin, watching him as they walk. \u201cWhat\u2019s that face for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t flirt casually,\u201d Lan Wangji says before he can stop himself. He cannot quite help how petulant he sounds. \u201cIf you do not mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s smile splits even wider, the kind where he crinkles around the eyes. He pauses for a moment to gently deposit his stash of food into the open hands of two street beggars, neither of whom can be older than ten. They tear off the moment they have the food, their bare feet slapping in the packed dirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to flirt with just you, is that it?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, turning back to Lan Wangji with a gleam in his eye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens his mouth to respond, but he finds he can\u2019t say a word to defend himself. He looks away, burning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs at him, which Lan Wangji thinks is probably, in this case, deserved. \u201cOkay, I get it, I understand. I\u2019ll only flirt with my husband from now on, how does that sound?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Good, </em>the buried, possessive part of Lan Wangji thinks before he can stop himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is only proper, when one is married,\u201d he says instead. It sounds like a good enough excuse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods with mock solemnity. \u201cIndeed, indeed. The matter of extramarital flirting is not to be taken lightly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, irritable at being teased.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wraps both arms around one of Lan Wangji\u2019s and sways into his space, his eyes glinting with mischief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFoolish me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a theatrical sigh, \u201cto flirt with anyone else when Lan Zhan is the most beautiful person in all of Lotus Pier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji really cannot abide by teasing like this at all. He tries to pull his arm from Wei Wuxian\u2019s grasp again, keeping his gaze averted as his ears heat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asked for flirting!\u201d Wei Wuxian reminds him, clinging on tighter. \u201cNow take responsibility!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not ask,\u201d Lan Wangji protests.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did! Oh, let\u2019s stop here, this one\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that, he drags Lan Wangji into a restaurant teeming with people. Through charm and some finagling, Wei Wuxian is able to procure them a table despite the packed quarters, where he promptly orders a smattering of smaller plates. Lan Wangji hears him rattle off mapo doufu, niushe bing, and shangxian liangfen, and one other he doesn\u2019t hear above the din of patrons talking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, shit, I forgot to order something without spice,\u201d Wei Wuxian says apologetically once the server leaves. \u201cAlthough I think your options in that area are quite limited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Lan Wangji says, folding his hands in his lap. He\u2019s not hungry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for the food to arrive, sizzling and smoking and, for the most part, very red. Wei Wuxian starts to pick various food off of the plates, sampling each one with loud sounds of enjoyment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says through watering eyes. \u201cThe GusuLan are very, um, nice to provide meals for me. It\u2019s just that I missed real food so much! Like, this one, the tofu, it has \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will try it,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian glances up to appraise him with raised eyebrows. \u201cLan Zhan, are you sure? It\u2019s, ah. It might be different from what you\u2019ve had. They make it pretty hot around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will try it,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, more stubbornly. Wei Wuxian has molded himself to fit a Lan lifestyle, a Lan diet, Lan clothes and traditions. He wants to love Lotus Pier the way Wei Wuxian does, its food and its people and every moving, breathing piece of this place that has made Wei Ying who he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks at him, his gaze gentling and his mouth curving up into a tiny smile before a quicker, broader grin overshadows it. \u201cOkay! This one\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He picks a cube of tofu up with his chopsticks, drenched in red sauce, and holds his sleeve as he reaches across the table. The intimacy of hand-feeding certainly does not escape Lan Wangji as he leans forward, his lips burning the moment they make contact with Wei Wuxian\u2019s chopsticks. The spice\u2019s heat rises to his face quickly as he does his best to chew. As he swallows, a path of fire traces down his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian watches him eagerly the whole time, perched cross-legged and leaning forward across the table. Lan Wangji can feel the reflexive tears wetting his lashes, his sinuses activating as he gives a quiet, miserable cough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says as he circles the table and plops down next to him. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re so cute! There was hardly any spice on that piece!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, coughing again and tearing up harder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hums and lifts his sleeve to wipe the tears away, dabbing at Lan Wangji\u2019s hot cheeks. \u201cThis dutiful husband won\u2019t force you to try any more, okay? Aiyo, your poor red face, look at you, tch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji goes still at Wei Wuxian\u2019s fussing, the pain of the spice entirely forgotten. Wei Wuxian freezes at the same time, his hands stilling and his wide eyes locked with Lan Wangji\u2019s. There\u2019s another moment where they stare at each other, and then Wei Wuxian is retreating, hitting his knee on the table as he goes, as he laughs and dodges and hand-waves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo there you have it, you can say now that you\u2019ve tried the best of Yunmeng\u2019s cuisine and survived!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that Lan Wangji has recovered a little, he nods with determination toward the bowl of jelly noodles. \u201cThat one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, paling. \u201cLan Zhan, I think you would really die if you tried shangxin liangfen. I, aha, appreciate your fortitude, but I really enjoy not being a widow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks genuinely fearful for his life, so Lan Wangji nods and concedes. And, after a few minutes \u2014 when Wei Wuxian takes a few bites of the dish and immediately coughs and flushes red \u2014 Lan Wangji determines the decision was probably for the better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time they leave the restaurant, the sun has begun to set, casting a low golden light like a fishing net over the market. The channels of water surrounding them fade from blue to bronze to rose and lavender as they wend their way down the main road, leisurely in pace as Wei Wuxian bounces from stall to stall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHandsome gege!\u201d a couple of young women exclaim to Wei Wuxian when the two of them walk past. Their arms are full to bursting with colorful blooms. \u201cGongzi, won\u2019t you take some flowers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs as the women shower him with peonies and chrysanthemums, loose petals catching in his hair and robes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered, guniangmen,\u201d he calls back, then gestures toward Lan Wangji. \u201cBut isn\u2019t this one much more handsome?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cVery handsome!\u201d the women agree, audibly sighing as they clutch their flowers closer to their chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pauses in his steps to turn toward Lan Wangji, and Lan Wangji follows suit. With a faint smile, Wei Wuxian reaches up to tuck a peony behind Lan Wangji\u2019s ear, adjusting a few strands of hair as he does. Lan Wangji\u2019s heart pounds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and he\u2019s so beautiful like this, smiling and sunset-drenched. \u201cNow you look just like the drawing I gave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he tucks another flower into the front of Lan Wangji\u2019s robe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh, no, </em>Lan Wangji thinks, with a sensation inside him like a landslide. A firm ground giving way.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falling in love with Wei Wuxian had not been part of the plan.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Falling in love with Wei Wuxian had not been part of the plan, but Lan Wangji realizes, now, that it has perhaps been an inevitability. Something already in motion, taking distinct shape before he knew a name for it. The roots of it he can trace to before their marriage, now that he knows what to look for, what to feel for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that he does know it, things within this arrangement are going to be exceedingly more difficult.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As night steadily falls, Wei Wuxian leads him toward one of the smaller piers. The reflections of hanging lanterns dapple the dark water with orange spheres like sunken stars. Even in light this dim, Lan Wangji can discern lotus pads as far as he can see, vanishing into the night. Behind them, the night market bustles on with a different energy than that of the daytime. Less industrious, more...joyful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian heaves a small sigh next to him, staring out into the water with a wistful expression. \u201cNext time, we can take a rowboat out and I\u2019ll teach you how to pick lotus seeds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, his voice soft. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian glances at him with a small, sad smile. \u201cI know we have to leave tomorrow. It was great I got to come here at all. But it\u2019s hard not to be homesick for a place like this, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He takes another step so their shoulders are level with each other\u2019s. \u201cWei Ying, we can visit as much as you like. You are not a prisoner of the GusuLan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs and looks away toward the water again. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet of you to say so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The way he says it makes Lan Wangji think he hasn\u2019t been believed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEither way,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, strangely serious for once. \u201cThank you for today. You really didn\u2019t have to, and it...it took my mind off of things.\u201d He offers Lan Wangji a half-smile, peering at him sideways. His cheek is still swollen from where Yu Ziyuan had struck him. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten pretty good at tolerating me, Lan Zhan. Have I finally worn you down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows the tight feeling in his throat. The realization from earlier beats like a second pulse in his chest, hot and overripe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not lie to Yu-furen.\u201d He watches the dark ripples of the water, wobbling white and red under the moon and lanterns. \u201cI welcome Wei Ying\u2019s company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hums, then reaches out to squeeze Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t have a choice about it either way, huh?\u201d Wei Wuxian says before he turns to go, and the words leave Lan Wangji cold.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is quiet the next day after they depart from Lotus Pier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He puts on a bright face through the farewells, wheeling out jokes and assuaging words. Jiang Yanli cries again when they say goodbye, while Jiang Wanyin holds himself rigid throughout it, his nostrils flared and his mouth tight. Yu Ziyuan is not in attendance to see him off, but Jiang Fengmian sends them with gifts that they can stow in their qiankun pouches, money packets and dry snacks for their journey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, Wei Wuxian is unsmiling when they mount their swords, and in the shichen of flying after. There is none of the carefree joy from their initial flight here. Wei Wuxian remains withdrawn and somber, hardly looking at Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They land only once they run into a storm near sundown, a wind-whipped rain needling them even through their clothes. Lan Wangji leads them down to the nearest town where they can find refuge for the evening. Wei Wuxian follows him without protest, answering in one-word replies when Lan Wangji asks what he\u2019d like for supper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The inn they find, one of the only in the village, is nearly at capacity, but the innkeeper takes one look at Lan Wangji\u2019s clothing and his jade pendant and he scrambles to find room for them. All around them, men and women are drinking and chattering, a din of sound above the rain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian only perks up when two men nearby mention the sighting of two yaoguai in the next town over. After a moment of eavesdropping on the various gory details of the most recent attack, Wei Wuxian turns to Lan Wangji with a strange intensity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA night-hunt just fell right into our laps, Lan Zhan!\u201d he says. \u201cWe should set out for Pailou tomorrow morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates. He doesn\u2019t want to quash Wei Wuxian\u2019s newfound excitement, so he says, \u201cLet\u2019s speak of it later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian procures a pot of liquor, and then they follow the innkeeper to a room out in the courtyard, one of the larger chambers with direct access to the outdoors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken down more yaoguai than I can count on two hands,\u201d Wei Wuxian is saying as soon as they\u2019re inside. He wrings rainwater out of his hair, out of his sleeves. \u201cThese two should be no problem. And it sounds like they\u2019re really causing the locals some problems, so \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji interrupts quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian freezes at his tone, his hands going still. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cannot,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He doesn\u2019t want to disappoint Wei Wuxian, especially not right now, and the feeling of knowing he\u2019s about to is leaden.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowns, his demeanor cooling. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a sect conference in Gusu, in two days\u2019 time,\u201d Lan Wangji says. It sounds trite when he says it, so he adds, \u201cAn important one,\u201d which makes it sound more trite.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at him as though he\u2019s suddenly sprouted a tail. \u201cA conf\u2014...there are people here who are getting hurt. Who are <em> dying. </em>It\u2019s our responsibility as cultivators to do something about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sect will send another cultivator to handle it,\u201d Lan Wangji answers. He hates the way it sounds, coming out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd waste days\u2019 worth of time?\u201d Wei Wuxian retorts, his fists clenching at his sides. \u201cWhy should we risk people\u2019s lives when we\u2019re <em> right here </em>and can take care of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then takes a breath. \u201cI have certain responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you go, and I\u2019ll stay here and deal with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows. He doesn\u2019t look Wei Wuxian in the eye, his gaze settling instead somewhere on his chest. \u201cWei Ying\u2019s attendance, as my new spouse and as a representative for the YunmengJiang, will be expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean as your servant,\u201d Wei Wuxian whips back. The words cut, stinging and barbed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says carefully. \u201cAs my husband.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy exactly am I expected to be there?\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s whole body has gone tight with tension. \u201cYou think any of those gentry cultivators care about what I have to say? About <em> anything</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor appearances\u2019 sake,\u201d Lan Wangji tries to explain, and he knows he\u2019s said the wrong thing because Wei Wuxian falters a step back toward the door and laughs. It is not a kind laugh. It\u2019s perhaps the first time Lan Wangji has heard Wei Wuxian laugh with no joy behind it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, appearances,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats with a nod. \u201cAnd what if I refuse to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This feels more about a principle, now, than it does about a conference. Lan Wangji remains quiet. Slashes of rain bear down on the windows and walls, thunder trembling through the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After another moment of silence, Wei Wuxian speaks again. \u201cYou said I wasn\u2019t a prisoner of the GusuLan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s reply is low-voiced, emphatic. \u201cYou are not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why do I feel like one?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and Lan Wangji can only think of his father\u2019s gaunt face, the last time he\u2019d seen him alive. His mother\u2019s house, gathering snow in thick and silent layers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sudden nausea he feels is gut-clenching. His father had loved his mother. It had not been enough. What mattered was that his mother had not loved him in return. What mattered was that his mother had died alone in confinement, ensnared by a love she never asked for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Provided his own childhood, Lan Wangji has always been of the conviction that he could never repeat his father\u2019s mistakes. Could never consciously bear or carry out his family\u2019s curse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yet, here he is. Hopelessly, freshly, sickly in love with someone who resents him. Who feels like his captive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is staring at him, waiting for him to say something. Perhaps to deny it, even. But Lan Wangji is struck dumb by a bone-deep aphasia. He cannot say anything at all, to that. Wei Wuxian had unwittingly landed a stunning strike, and Lan Wangji can only stare blankly back at him in reply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At last, the silence stretches enough to feel taut, the appropriate moment for a reply long past. Wei Wuxian huffs, gives one nod as if confirming something to himself. Then he vanishes out into the rain, the sliding door slamming shut behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares after him, his feet rooted in place. He could go after him, attempt to draw him out of the rain, but it\u2019s clear Wei Wuxian wants to be left alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is not sure how much time passes, standing there and staring at a closed door, waiting for it to open again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The evening deepens, the storm unrelenting, and Wei Wuxian does not return. It occurs to Lan Wangji, in slow-cresting waves, that he might not. So at last, Lan Wangji begins to move, to woodenly prepare for his nighttime rituals. He combs his hair, cleans and treats it with the oils in his qiankun pouch. He sets out his robes for the next day, then settles into his sleep-clothes. The same rituals he has followed every single night, without fail, since he was a child, since he was old enough to care for himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, he sits on the bed, the candles brought low.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Lan Wangji does as Lan Wangji is wont to do. He waits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s after another shichen of lying in bed, staring at the dark ceiling, that Lan Wangji hears Wei Wuxian come in; hears the scrape of the door sliding quietly open, the swell of rainfall made loud, and then shut. Wei Wuxian\u2019s footfalls are tentative as he approaches the bed, as though he\u2019s trying not to wake Lan Wangji. As if it were a possibility Lan Wangji could sleep, with Wei Ying gone, out in the rain and dark. His heart still feels like a wire coiled tight, sharp and tense and stinging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lies down next to him, curling in close. He\u2019s damp from the rain. He smells like fresh, wet earth, woodfire smoke from stalls in town; a little like sweet rice wine. Lan Wangji keeps his eyes closed, though he\u2019s certain the stiffness of his posture gives him away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says quietly after another moment. \u201cAre you awake? You are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes open, and he stares at the intricate carvings in the canopy above them. Wei Wuxian sighs, a hot sound next to Lan Wangji\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have lashed out at you. You have no more control over this situation than I do. It\u2019s not like you were given a choice, either. I\u2019m not the only one who has the right to be frustrated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s where Wei Wuxian is wrong. Lan Wangji had a choice \u2014 to keep Wei Wuxian close to him, with the knowledge he may be unhappy, or to give him away to a stranger. He\u2019d made the selfish one. He hadn\u2019t realized quite how selfish it was at the time, but it had been a theft of Wei Wuxian\u2019s autonomy no less.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re stuck like this as much as I am,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues, his voice still hushed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A curl of bile burns Lan Wangji\u2019s chest. He had thought, over the past few weeks...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d been na\u00efve \u2014 and greedy \u2014 to think this was something Wei Wuxian could want, when he\u2019d never had a choice to refuse. How can he expect Wei Wuxian to feel anything for him except contempt, in such a context?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you. I wasn\u2019t earlier, either. Not with you. Okay?\u201d Wei Wuxian hesitates, perhaps attempting to interpret Lan Wangji\u2019s silence, then says softly, \u201cYou\u2019ve been good to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens his mouth to reply to this, but Wei Wuxian sweeps on before he can be interrupted. \u201cI could\u2019ve been foisted off on anyone, someone who might\u2019ve \u2014\u00a0hurt me, or mistreated me. I know that I\u2019ve been lucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lucky, to be forced into a marriage of convenience with Lan Wangji when Wei Wuxian does not love him, cannot love him. As if decent treatment isn\u2019t the very base of what he deserves. There\u2019s a taste like ash in Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian keeps going, tentative but earnest and unmistakably sincere. \u201cI\u2019m lucky Lan Zhan is my husband.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d Lan Wangji closes his eyes again. Wei Wuxian tenses slightly by his side at the sound of his voice, but doesn\u2019t move away from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are numerous things Lan Wangji could say in response to that. A rebuttal. An apology. A promise that one day, Wei Wuxian will be free to do as he wishes, not tethered by the ankle to a man and a marriage he does not want.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he says, \u201cIf you want to go out, please don\u2019t do so like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pauses, then says, sounding thrown, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI...\u201d Lan Wangji trails off, then tries again. \u201cI will not keep you here, against your will. You are free to go wherever you wish, whenever and for however long. But if you go again, do not go at night. Alone, when the weather is poor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then swallows. \u201cOh. Okay. Yeah, okay. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji moves to push the sheets off of himself, and Wei Wuxian flails a little in his surprise. \u201cLan Zhan ah, I didn\u2019t mean for you to get up \u2014 what are you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lan Wangji says, rubbing a knuckle tiredly against his eye. \u201cI will have more hot water brought in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t need to \u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, sitting upright in the bed. \u201cNot when I was the one to\u2026ah, Lan Zhan, it\u2019s the middle of the night and I know that you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have been out in the cold and rain for an entire shichen,\u201d Lan Wangji points out, and wraps his silk robe tighter around himself. A damp chill creeps in between his bare toes, slithers beneath his layers. \u201cYou could fall ill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at him from the bed for another moment, inscrutable in the dark. He seems as though he might voice another protest. Then he says, surprisingly compliant, \u201cOkay,\u201d and slides out of bed. Wei Wuxian watches as Lan Wangji re-dresses himself and ducks out into the rain, and he waits silently with his arms wrapped around his chest upon Lan Wangji\u2019s return, radiating guilt as two of the inn staff help to bring in hot water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re gone, Lan Wangji removes his re-dampened layers, folding them neatly until just the last robe remains. Wei Wuxian is still watching him without a word as Lan Wangji lights two more candles near the privacy screen. Wei Wuxian approaches the bath slowly, his wet hair clinging to his neck like ropes of seaweed. Then he stops and stares at Lan Wangji for a long moment. The look seems strangely expectant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then drops his gaze and fidgets with his belt, uncharacteristically reticent. \u201cMay I entreat my husband\u2019s help in preparing to bathe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks, his breath catching in his throat. Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze darts to him again, assessing his reaction, though Lan Wangji keeps his features blank. He nods to the inquiry and sets down the candle. Wei Wuxian turns, his back to Lan Wangji and his dripping hair slung over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tentatively, Lan Wangji eases one sodden layer off of Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders, then the next. Wei Wuxian is surprisingly quiet, none of his usual teasing chatter or flirtations to fill the silence between them. Perhaps being outside, for so long and in such weather, has exhausted him. Perhaps it\u2019s this deep and liminal hour of night, in which speech seems stranger than silence. Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers work to unpeel each robe until only the inner remains, clinging like wet paper to Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin. This close, Lan Wangji can see the bumps grazing the back of Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck, hairs raised with the cold. Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin is warm regardless, soft against the tips of Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers as he works the last layer off with his heart in his throat. He does not allow his eyes to linger too long, though he quickly drinks in the snatches of Wei Wuxian\u2019s musculature, the lithe wings of his shoulders and his slim waist, raised whip welts branded into his skin from Zidian. He just barely keeps himself from touching, from drifting his fingers over the scars, long faded with age. Wei Wuxian holds himself very still, the line of his shoulders taut. There are only the wet inner trousers left now, clinging to the hidden curves of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I can take the rest from here,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and the sound of his voice shakes Lan Wangji from his daze. \u201cThanks, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes the cue for the dismissal, treading a respectful step back before he turns and drapes Wei Wuxian\u2019s wet robes over the side of the privacy screen. Then he moves mechanically toward the bed to lie down again. He listens, for the next few minutes, to the sounds of Wei Wuxian bathing, the quiet slop of water against the wooden basin and the crackling noises of soap moving over Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin, through his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has his chin tilted toward the privacy screen while he waits, lost in thought, when Wei Wuxian circles around it earlier than he expected, dripping in spatters onto the wooden floors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hair is unbound, falling to his shoulders, and his naked form sends a shock of heat through Lan Wangji, a physical jolt he isn\u2019t certain he conceals. Wei Wuxian watches him from the privacy screen for a moment \u2014 assessing his reaction, maybe \u2014 and his expression is unreadable in the low light, but he makes no move to cover himself or any modest exclamations, and Lan Wangji, like a man possessed, can\u2019t pull his eyes away from the sudden, startling reveal of so much new skin. The vee of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hipbones is sharp, pronounced, tapering to a dark thatch of pubic hair and his cock hanging soft between his legs. Not as large here as Lan Wangji, but still decently sized and \u2014 nicely shaped, slightly flared at the head. Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth waters with a sudden flood of spit, his vision blurring. Wei Wuxian is so unbelievably lovely from head to toe that it isn\u2019t entirely out of the question that Lan Wangji is dreaming, that this Wei Ying is a particularly lurid fantasy \u2014 except then Wei Wuxian moves, the reverie broken as he reaches up to pull one of Lan Wangji\u2019s inner robes down from where it hangs on the privacy screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Released from the spell, Lan Wangji turns his face back toward the ceiling, his skin overheated and his mouth dry. Shamefully, he can feel that he\u2019s partially hard, an interested throb in his groin just from the sight of Wei Wuxian naked, as innocent as it had been. Wei Wuxian has never been a champion of modesty; reared with a younger brother and several other boys his age, he would have had a very different upbringing from Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji seeing him unclothed is no different from anyone else. But Lan Wangji cannot shake the strange sense that it had been intentional. That Wei Wuxian had been offering something to him, some unlocked threshold of intimacy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps his eyes shut tight when Wei Wuxian joins him in bed a moment later, warmth and a waft of floral soap. Wei Wuxian had been naked moments ago and now he\u2019s in Lan Wangji\u2019s bed, close enough that Lan Wangji can feel the push of Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath against his skin. Under the sheets, Lan Wangji clenches his fist tight enough that his knuckles silently crack, his fingernails cutting into his palm. The sensation distracts him from everything else, grounds him. Wanting Wei Ying in this way, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s unruly. It\u2019s undisciplined.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s futile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thoughts leave him sleepless enough that by the time morning comes, his eyes feel gritty and heavy. Whatever odd, silent tension had thickened between them last night has evaporated by the time morning sun breaks over the room. Wei Wuxian brightly rambles to him all during breakfast, so entirely himself that Lan Wangji has to take a long moment to question if any of the events of the previous night had happened at all. In any case, wishful hallucination or not, he can no longer look at Wei Wuxian without visualizing the shape of him under all of his layers. One particular shape, to be specific. Lan Wangji sips his tea with deep, meditative focus, nodding to all of Wei Wuxian\u2019s questions and resolutely ignoring the heat in his ears that threatens to give him away. Though he is a married man, and none of his sect\u2019s rules forbid fantasizing about one\u2019s spouse, it doesn\u2019t feel proper regardless, their situation being what it is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, clapping his hands together with what Lan Wangji thinks may be feigned lightness. \u201cBack to Gusu, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head and sets down his tea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Wei Wuxian says blankly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs Wei Ying said,\u201d Lan Wangji returns, \u201cthere are those here who need our help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThe...the sect conference. You said yourself that you can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere will be more conferences,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly. \u201cThis demands our attention more. My sect will understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hesitates, studying him for a long moment. \u201cLan Zhan, are you sure? Your sect doesn\u2019t seem like the, um \u2014 understanding type. No offense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji purses his lips and replies, \u201cEat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian does, but Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t miss his small, hidden smile, or the way his gaze softens, just a little.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tracking down the two yaoguai, with the skills shared between them, does not take long.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The town of Pailou is small, and a fearful word travels as quickly as wildfire catching. Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian simply follow the clamor of it, with Wei Wuxian doing most of the actual questioning. Wei Wuxian has some contraption to help him, a compass he\u2019d started creating (\u201ca work in progress,\u201d so he says) that can detect resentful energy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tracking is, surprisingly enough, the easy part. The fight itself shouldn\u2019t be any more difficult, given their joint prowess as swordsmen. But they discover quickly, when they catch up to the creatures in the middle of the woods, that the yaoguai are jueyuan, monkey-like creatures that can attack from the trees with lethal agility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji guides Bichen easily, flashing strikes in the growing dark as the jueyuan screech at them from the trees and dodge the blows. None of his hits land. A jueyuan possesses a near-human intelligence, Lan Wangji knows, and they are in their element here, attacking from treetops. Eventually, he and Wei Wuxian have to chase them on foot, following the echo of the creatures\u2019 screeches as they move from tree to tree.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It should be a simple hunt; Wei Wuxian had made it sound like it would be. Lan Wangji knows, later, that he can\u2019t have predicted a cultivator as talented as Wei Wuxian would get hurt. But as the screeching increases in volume, he hears Wei Wuxian yell, \u201cLan Zhan, look out!\u201d and it\u2019s enough to distract him from what matters; enough for him to turn on instinct toward a dark, apish blur already scurrying away. By the time he hears Wei Wuxian cry out, it\u2019s already too late.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji whirls back around, the other jueyuan is retreating into the treetops with furious, squalling shrieks, and Wei Wuxian \u2014 Wei Ying is \u2014 crumpling against one of the nearest bamboo trees, his face ashen in the lengthening dark. The screeches grow quieter, more distant through the trees. The jueyuan are escaping, retreating. If Lan Wangji were a worthy cultivator, he would follow after them, stop at nothing until the job is done and other lives are spared.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thought does not cross his mind. He races to Wei Wuxian\u2019s side, dropping to his knees and steeling a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says. His own voice sounds very far away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian rasps, and as he speaks, blood drips down his chin, down his neck. He curses and spits; more blood. So much blood that it doesn\u2019t seem possible all of it could come from inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has never felt fear like this. Night hunts and fights have never rattled him; since as long as he can remember, he has been schooled in disciplines of calm, meditative control in such situations. True fear like this is paralytic. He can hardly move his limbs, like he\u2019s suspended in a frozen lake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swears again, then explains through wet gasps, \u201cTalisman \u2014 rebounded \u2014 curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear, with each word, that he\u2019s struggling to breathe. He grips at Lan Wangji\u2019s arms tightly with the panic of a drowning man. His eyes are wide, afraid against what are clearly his best efforts, his lips glistening and dark.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what to do,\u201d Lan Wangji says helplessly. He is as familiar with curses as his studies have allowed, but he has nowhere near Wei Wuxian\u2019s breadth of knowledge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d Wei Wuxian rasps, gesturing in the direction of the vanished jueyuan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is abruptly furious at the suggestion. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan \u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian tries, then coughs harder, curling in on himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a yao curse Lan Wangji is familiar with, a rebound curse \u2014 one in which the injuries inflicted on the yao are transferred back to the caster. If that\u2019s the case, it means Wei Wuxian had injured the creature in turn. Badly. Without a core to mediate the damage, it\u2019s likely Wei Wuxian had killed it, or at least brought it near death. The curse would have struck Wei Wuxian squarely in return, dealing whatever state of injury had been inflicted on the creature.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever the solution, it won\u2019t be found out here, in the middle of the woods as the evening grows darker and darker. Lan Wangji bundles Wei Wuxian into his arms, who is either too weak or too incapacitated to protest, and guides them both back to town on his sword. Wei Wuxian is still trying to breathe around the blood with wet, rattling gasps. There is still so much of it, seemingly without a source. The front of Lan Wangji\u2019s clean white robes is stained as dark as a wine-spill.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lands them once they return to town, then ignores the innkeeper\u2019s surprised shout when he blazes inside the inn, both of them blood-soaked and drawing stares. He carries Wei Wuxian up to their room and seals the door shut behind him with a quick spell. Then, quickly, he transfers Wei Wuxian onto the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is still hanging onto his sleeve with a bunched fist. His face is blanched, drawn with pain. His eyes are clenched shut, his breathing shallow and a sheen of sweat over his face. Blood keeps bubbling between his lips, running down his chin as he coughs around it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This feeling, too, is new. To experience Wei Ying\u2019s pain as acutely as if it\u2019s his own simply by seeing it, simply for the fact that it\u2019s Wei Ying. To know that he would lay his own life down, if it meant one specific person wouldn\u2019t be in pain a moment longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji begins to tear at Wei Wuxian\u2019s layers, burrowing and unpeeling the various robes until Wei Wuxian\u2019s torso is bare. Wei Wuxian is barely conscious; if he were, he\u2019d likely make some teasing joke about Lan Wangji\u2019s impropriety. Lan Wangji wants to be teased. Every day, for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds the curse mark easily, a black blight on Wei Wuxian\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji knows little about Wei Wuxian\u2019s school of cultivation. He is not by any means an expert in curse work, not the way Wei Wuxian is in all matters relating to this. But he knows enough. Enough for this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He places two fingers to the black wound on Wei Wuxian\u2019s side, and he begins.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s vision goes dark for a long time after that. The blood is as unpleasant to experience firsthand as it had appeared. It keeps gushing up in his lungs, filling his mouth over and over as though he can\u2019t get above water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice cuts through to him as he\u2019s floating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do,\u201d Wei Wuxian is muttering. He sounds frantic. More than that, he sounds angry. Lan Wangji has never heard him sound so angry. \u201cLan Zhan, Lan Wangji, what the <em> hell </em>did you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t speak, because if he opens his mouth, more blood will spill over. He can taste the next tide of it rising in his throat, metallic and cotton-thick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFool,\u201d Wei Wuxian seethes, even as Lan Wangji feels a cool hand brushing damp hair off his forehead. \u201cYou absolute fool.\u201d One of Wei Wuxian\u2019s knuckles catches on his forehead ribbon, knocks it askew. Lan Wangji is surprised, somewhat, by the discovery that Wei Wuxian\u2019s rage runs cold. He would have guessed his temper snapped up like a spark, like some fiery planet, burning bright like the rest of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019d better not die,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and he still sounds furious but his voice cracks on the words. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together. You <em> said. </em>We took vows and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to open his mouth to tell him, very reasonably, that he will not die, but the blood in his throat wells, spills over his lips and dribbles down his front. Wei Wuxian brushes it away with his fingers, dirtying his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you die, I\u2019m gonna be <em> so </em>pissed,\u201d Wei Wuxian says darkly. \u201cDo you think I won\u2019t come find you and annoy you beyond the grave? Do you think I won\u2019t come drag you out of Diyu myself? Lan Zhan, if this is some misguided ploy for attention because you want a divorce, you\u2019re going to have to try harder to get rid of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji fumbles blindly for Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and squeezes in lieu of trying to talk again. He isn\u2019t sure what it\u2019s trying to convey, something between <em> I don\u2019t want to divorce you </em> and, perhaps more pressingly, <em> I won\u2019t die. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m so angry with you, you have no idea,\u201d Wei Wuxian carries on, and Lan Wangji feels a cold washcloth against his overheated skin, dabbing under his chin and along his neck. \u201cI am incandescent with rage. This is officially our first fight. No, our second fight. You\u2019d better not leave me here on my own, Lan Zhan, I can\u2019t be a widow at 20.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is talking just to talk now, Lan Wangji senses, but he does feel bad for the fear he hears shaking Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice. Not bad enough to regret transferring the curse mark to himself. But a little bad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRest, sweetheart,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and it sounds like the term of endearment slips out of him, thoughtless, like it had maybe been an accident. Had mostly likely been an accident. Nevertheless, the honeyed shape of the word follows Lan Wangji down, down into the deep lakebed murk of unconsciousness, and he dreams of Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji wakes, his throat is dry enough to crackle when he swallows, hot air scraping into his lungs. He finally opens his eyes for the first time since the transfer, squinting blearily through the pain. He\u2019s propped up in a seated position in the bed, presumably so he won\u2019t choke to death on his own blood. He finds Wei Wuxian kneeling on the floor, his cheek pillowed on his forearms as he sleeps at the bedside. The color has returned to his cheeks, Lan Wangji is gratified to note, although he looks a little sallow and tired, his closed eyes sunken and dark circles hanging under his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> He should be in our bed, </em>Lan Wangji thinks, and then he drifts again. When his awareness returns, the space at his bedside is empty, the room dark and cool and a muted blue, pre-dawn palette. Lan Wangji\u2019s throat is on fire, thick blood congealing behind his teeth and down his throat, a dizzy ringing in his skull. He floats to escape it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The third time he wakes, it\u2019s because he feels nothing at all, aside from a peaceful, bone-deep weariness. No pain, no blood other than the lingering, foul taste on his tongue. He blinks, wondering if he\u2019s dreaming. His clothes are gone, at least the outer layers of his top half, which means Wei Wuxian must have undressed him at some point; most likely to clean the blood out of his robes, if they\u2019re even worth salvaging. Wei Ying, who is \u2014 still nowhere to be found. Lan Wangji is too exhausted, still, to get up and search for him, and it turns out he doesn\u2019t need to. Not much later, Wei Wuxian slips back through the door. He immediately brightens when he sees Lan Wangji awake. His husband is paler than usual, ragged at the edges with sleep loss, but nonetheless as handsome as always, in an appealing and unkempt way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, crossing quickly to kneel by the bed again. \u201cI got sick of waiting so I went out to find the jueyuan and took care of it. Took a while to hunt it down, but it was already in pretty bad shape, so it didn\u2019t give me too much trouble. The other one got away for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should perhaps reproach Wei Ying for running off on his own to hunt two monsters when he\u2019d been badly wounded the first time, but the only thing Lan Wangji can feel at the moment is relief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, his voice nearly gone, and Wei Wuxian is up again, fetching a bowl of water. He helps guide the cup into Lan Wangji\u2019s parched mouth, watching closely to make sure he doesn\u2019t spill any of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says again, more clearly, once he\u2019s drunk his fill. He closes his eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only what I should have done,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers promptly. \u201cIt was my curse to deal with, not yours. When you\u2019re more awake, I\u2019m going to yell at you properly. You\u2019re going to weep with longing for your shufu\u2019s lectures by the time I\u2019m through with you, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his eyes sliding shut. He is indeed very tired. Wei Wuxian is a good husband. The best husband he could ask for. He has a mind to tell him so, but he must doze off again, because when he awakes again for an uncounted time, the room has fallen dark and Wei Wuxian is sleeping at his side, curled up comfortably in the covers, snoring lightly with his mouth open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is a sweet if unruly sleeper, attempting to populate the entire surface area of a bed, his hair tangled around his face, a thread of drool on the pillow. <em> He is mine, </em>Lan Wangji thinks, watching him in the dark with an overfull feeling in his chest, like a green thing sprouting from the earth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both sleep well into the next day, napping close to each other as a steady rain drums against the roof, pattering against the windows. Even the thunder is welcome, a comforting rumble. It is possible Lan Wangji would be content to stay in bed like this with Wei Ying every day, sleeping through storms in rooms silvery and half-dim. Finally, on a particularly loud clap of thunder, Wei Wuxian jolts awake, his bleary eyes locking on Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Wei Wuxian says after another moment, stirring even more. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lan Wangji replies. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods and yawns, knuckling sleep out of one of his eyes. He slumps back down into the bed, grumbling unintelligibly into the pillow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it about sleeping a lot that just makes you want to sleep more?\u201d he mumbles, then straightens up so that he\u2019s propped on one elbow. \u201cOh, I\u2019m supposed to be yelling at you. Lan Zhan, what the hell were you <em> thinking</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hadn\u2019t, really. Been thinking. He\u2019d simply wanted to remove Wei Ying from danger. Whatever option was first available, no matter the personal cost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were hurt,\u201d Lan Wangji says, ignoring the weight of Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze on his face. \u201cIt seemed fair to take my share.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your <em> share</em>?\u201d Wei Wuxian's voice has gone sharp. \u201cLan Zhan, listen to me. I don\u2019t want you doing something like that on my behalf ever again. On <em> anyone\u2019s </em>behalf. Something as easy as a curse, I can handle \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I cannot?\u201d Lan Wangji says evenly, staring Wei Wuxian down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth flops open, then shuts again. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. You know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji would rather take such pain than see Wei Wuxian subjected to it. It\u2019s something he cannot say, and likely something he can\u2019t make Wei Wuxian understand. Perhaps it does make him selfish, if he acts on it against Wei Wuxian\u2019s wishes. And yet...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is currently studying his face, gleaning his own conclusions from Lan Wangji\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, still watching him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s reply is quiet, an echo of an earlier response. \u201cYou were hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I want to see you hurting either?\u201d Wei Wuxian snaps. He rolls over onto his back to glare at the ceiling, his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cI thought I was going to be sick seeing you like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you said,\u201d Lan Wangji says, \u201ca curse is easy. I apologize for doing something against your wishes. I will not apologize for sparing you pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian keeps glowering at the bed canopy, then says, softer, nonsensical, \u201cYou\u2019re not \u2014 supposed to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSupposed to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake pain that\u2019s mine,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThat\u2019s my\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the drum of rainfall, in Wei Wuxian\u2019s sudden silence. Another roll of thunder shudders against the walls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again,\u201d Wei Wuxian says eventually, much quieter, the fight gone from him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lying is against his sect disciplines. One of the most prominent and oft-repeated ones. Lan Wangji finds himself breaking this particular rule more and more often, these days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he replies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once Lan Wangji is recovered enough to travel, the two of them set off east toward the next town, following the trail of rumors and reports.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is familiar with jueyuan lore from his studies. The creatures are notorious sexual predators, often adopting human form to seduce and kidnap young women, sometimes men. The answers to the questions he and Wei Wuxian ask the locals quickly begin to point in a shared direction: a string of attacks in brothels throughout the surrounding towns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever been to a brothel, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks as they wend their way through town. Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands are full with his latest haul of baozi. He munches on one of the buns as they maneuver through foot-traffic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is certain he\u2019s being teased with the question, given Wei Wuxian cannot possibly be ignorant to the answer, so he simply gives his husband a dour look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, seeming pleased with his response. \u201cI thought so!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, steeling himself before he asks, \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian trips over his feet and drops one of his meat buns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure I have,\u201d he says, puffing out his chest a bit once he recovers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like that, Lan Wangji\u2019s mood sours, a dark cloud settling over him. He knows that Wei Wuxian has a certain reputation among cultivators their age; it is only to be expected that he is experienced in such matters. Lan Wangji had known it was a probability when they married. That being as it is, having it confirmed does little to assuage him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLots of times,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues, licking his fingers one by one with loud smacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji picks up his pace, suddenly determined to leave Wei Wuxian behind him, and Wei Wuxian makes a sound of protest and scrambles to catch up. \u201cWait, wait! I \u2014 I\u2019m just kidding, Lan Zhan, I really \u2014 I haven\u2019t actually been to one, don\u2019t be mad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The relief Lan Wangji feels at the admission is hardly comforting. He pauses, slowing down to fall into step with Wei Wuxian again. \u201cThen why say so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tosses the remaining scraps of his food away and scratches the back of his head, his face scrunching. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I used to kind of just \u2014 run my mouth like that a lot, with other boys in Lotus Pier. Then when I said it just now, I remembered the GusuLan might actually disown me if they thought I really did go dogging around like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says. Brothels or no, Wei Wuxian is undoubtedly more experienced in these matters than he is. Wei Ying had been a relentless and incurable flirt when he had studied at the Cloud Recesses, as if Lan Wangji could forget one burning, furious second of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nudges Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder as they walk. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be my first time going into one too, alright? I can do most of the talking for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has probably kissed many girls. Maybe even dozens. It\u2019s likely some of them had even loved him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it won\u2019t have to be scary at all,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And how could they not? Wei Wuxian is an impossible person not to love. At once, Lan Wangji finds himself searingly, irrationally jealous of faceless women he\u2019s never met, who have...those who have touched Wei Ying in ways he...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian snaps his fingers in front of Lan Wangji\u2019s face. \u201cHey. Lan Zhan. Hello? Are you there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not startle at the noise, but turns to look at Wei Wuxian coolly, giving nothing away. Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth is very pink, shiny with grease from the pork bun. It should be unappealing. It should certainly do nothing in the way of making him look kissable. Lan Wangji is dismally, wretchedly in love with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> said, </em> I\u2019m going to have to fight to keep everyone\u2019s hands off of you at the brothel,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, completely oblivious. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m going to have to compete with so many women to protect your honor! I might die in the process! It\u2019s not your fault; you can\u2019t help being as beautiful as you are, but it <em> is </em> an inconvenient hazard for our line of work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns at him, befuddled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs as he scrutinizes Lan Wangji's face with dawning pity. \u201cAh, Lan Zhan, sweet Lan Zhan, you\u2019re so innocent. What would you know of our world\u2019s sordid underbelly? I\u2019ll do my best to protect you. I\u2019ll be your, hmm, brothel guide, and I\u2019ll make sure no one touches you, okay? I can\u2019t have someone else swooping in and stealing my husband \u2014 how would that make <em> me </em> look? I\u2019ll just have to do everything in my power to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji interrupts, lost. \u201cWhat are you talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs again, more theatrically, and slides an elbow onto Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder to lean into him as they walk. \u201cLan Zhan, we\u2019re walking into a <em> sex </em>den. It\u2019s going to be full of women ready to eat you alive. It\u2019s going to be like dangling a scrap of meat into a lair of starving tigers. I hate to be the one to corrupt your innocent sensibility by telling you this, but there is nobody with a working pair of eyes that isn\u2019t thinking about sleeping with you. Like I said, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying has a working pair of eyes,\u201d Lan Wangji points out, mostly because the sex conversation is annoying him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian removes the arm and begins to splutter. \u201cI \u2014 clearly I didn\u2019t mean \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe jueyuan,\u201d Lan Wangji says. The rest of this talk is irrelevant, and is frankly beginning to wear on the nerves. \u201cThe last witness said there was an attack at a brothel in Qianshen, to a young woman he visits there regularly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight!\u201d Wei Wuxian says quickly. \u201c<em>So </em> right, Lan Zhan. Uh, let\u2019s \u2014 yeah, let\u2019s head that way. If we travel by sword, we can probably make it there by you shi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With little more to say on the subject, they set off toward Qianshen.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Given Wei Wuxian\u2019s dramatic build-up of suspense, Lan Wangji is half-expecting to be snatched off his feet the moment they enter the brothel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reality is much duller, to his relief. They are thoroughly ignored upon entry, only drawing a few openly confused looks from surrounding patrons. The place is relatively empty at the moment, but there are a few men scattered throughout the more secluded corners of the main area, otherwise...engaged with half-dressed women. Lan Wangji keeps his gaze fixed forward, narrowing his line of vision to block them out. He can feel his jaw is clenched with tension. Even being here is a violation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...huh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says as he looks around, sounding oddly deflated. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like I thought it would be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A red-lipped young woman, dressed in a flowing, arctic-blue hanfu, approaches them with a curt greeting. Her dark hair is pinned back in a bun and adorned with a jade floral hairpin. \u201cWhat services are you seeking, gongzimen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNone!\u201d Wei Wuxian interrupts, sliding in front of Lan Wangji like he\u2019s physically shielding him. \u201cWe\u2019re only here to ask for information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman seems surprised by this. Then she makes a show of slowly taking in Wei Wuxian from head to toe, an unmistakable leer. \u201cAre you sure about that, pretty gege?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her tone had only shifted when it had become clear Wei Wuxian would not be making an immediate transaction. Her engagement with Wei Wuxian is nothing beyond selling a service. She is not interested in Wei Wuxian, only his money. Lan Wangji knows all of this, rationally. Knowing it does nothing to stop his fists from tightening at his sides, a streak of possessiveness rearing its ugly, snapping head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his voice cracking a little. \u201cNo, really, we\u2019re just here to. Ask some questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman slinks forward and draws one finger down the line of Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat, who audibly swallows. She sticks her lower lip out in a pout, looking at him through her long black lashes. \u201cAre you sure there\u2019s...nothing I can do to change your mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHands off,\u201d Lan Wangji snaps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman blinks at his tone and redirects her attention to him. She does not flinch, to her credit, but her eyes widen slightly at whatever expression she sees on Lan Wangji\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, breezy and a little nervous-sounding, and skitters a few steps back to Lan Wangji\u2019s side. \u201cAhaha, I\u2019m flattered, guniang, but as you can see, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m already spoken for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The young woman sulks, abruptly dropping the seductive act in favor of bored petulance. She folds her arms across her chest and sways her hips. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you any information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, kind jiejie, don\u2019t be so sour,\u201d Wei Wuxian cajoles, and then pulls Lan Wangji in by the arm. \u201cThis is my husband, see?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman narrows her eyes at Lan Wangji with clear skepticism, cutting her eyes up then down. \u201cLike hell are you married to him. A scrawny rascal like you with a specimen like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian splutters in his indignation. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I was ranked the <em> fourth-most handsome </em>in the \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman waves her hand irritably. She has evidently lost any hope or interest in making a sale. \u201cI don\u2019t give up information to liars. Certainly not when they have the audacity to lie to my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, tightening his grip on Lan Wangji\u2019s arm. \u201cWe really are married!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKiss him then,\u201d the woman says promptly, then raises a snide, perfectly painted eyebrow at the choking sound Wei Wuxian makes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the words, Lan Wangji feels a shiver of heat crawl up his neck, a low ringing in his ears. A sudden kick of adrenaline. For nothing, because Wei Wuxian won\u2019t \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\" The woman starts to turn away in a tacit dismissal, and Wei Wuxian calls after her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wait, </em>I can prove it! I \u2014 I kiss Lan Zhan all the time.\u201d Wei Wuxian darts a nervous glance to Lan Wangji, wetting his lips. \u201cRight, um, dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives one slow nod, his heart still knocking hard against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats, more faintly. His eyes are wide and a little dilated, focused on Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth. \u201cI really...can never stop myself from\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sways into his space, his hand fitting flat over Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, where his pulse hammers against Wei Wuxian\u2019s palm. Lan Wangji has no time to brace himself before Wei Wuxian leans in and quickly brushes their mouths together, warm and hesitant and a little shy, clumsy enough to nearly miss. Lan Wangji inhales sharply anyway, a hot flush bursting through him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pulls back with his eyes halfway closed, a dazed expression on his face. His lips are much pinker than before, a little shiny. His tongue darts out to lick them, almost hungrily, the focus of his dark gaze still on Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth. And then he\u2019s leaning in again more assuredly, kissing Lan Wangji harder than before. Lan Wangji makes a low sound into it, helpless as Wei Wuxian melts into him. At that first kiss, Lan Wangji had held himself rigid and still, afraid to even breathe incorrectly. Now he moves, one of his hands fitting to the small of Wei Wuxian\u2019s back to pull him in as the kiss deepens, open-mouthed. Wei Wuxian has both of his hands curled in the front of Lan Wangji\u2019s robes, making small noises against Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth like he can\u2019t quite help himself. Maybe he\u2019s putting on a show to sell, an exaggerated effect, but it <em> feels </em>real, it feels like \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sound at their right, like a throat clearing. Wei Wuxian wrenches himself back with a startled, hitched gasp, then wipes his mouth on his sleeve. For a moment, the two of them stare at each other in mutual shock, their chests heaving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji abruptly remembers their surroundings \u2014 that they aren\u2019t the only two in the room. When he turns, two other women have joined behind the first. They\u2019re openly gawping at Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian in amazement, their cheeks a little flushed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWo-ow,\u201d the first woman says, her brows nearly disappearing into the wrinkles of her forehead. \u201cI was just messing with you to see if you\u2019d do it. Thanks for the show, I guess? Come with me, gongzimen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flanked by the other two women, she turns and waves a hand over her shoulder, directing them down a dimly lit hallway that branches off the main area.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry!!\u201d Wei Wuxian says immediately, sounding somewhat hysterical. \u201cHaha, I\u2019m sorry!! Um \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps walking, his eyes fastened to the fluttering silks trailing behind the three women, not looking at Wei Wuxian. He can feel his hands are still shaking with lingering adrenaline. He is embarrassingly, unremittingly hard, just from \u2014 that. It makes it uncomfortable to walk, but he certainly does not want to let on to Wei Wuxian how affected he is by a staged kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time and time again, Lan Wangji thinks, everything between them has been externally directed and demanded. Their strings pulled like marionette puppets. Even this, too, had been mandated of them. Everything performed, dictated. The fact doesn\u2019t make Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth tingle any less. He cannot un-know the truth of kissing Wei Ying, no matter the context.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian moves in front of Lan Wangji to intercept him with a panicked expression. \u201cLan Zhan, please say you\u2019re not mad. It won\u2019t happen again! I really wasn\u2019t thinking clearly and I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cXiao gege,\u201d a nasal voice rings out down the hall. Wei Wuxian turns toward the sound, then stumbles back when a scantily clad figure makes her way toward them. The woman is very \u2014 close to undressed. It\u2019s something of a shock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the sight of her approaching, Wei Wuxian backs up right into Lan Wangji\u2019s front. Lan Wangji sucks in a quick breath and, entirely without his permission, he feels himself harden further against Wei Wuxian\u2019s back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian goes curiously stiff against him, freezing in place for an endless, mortifying span of seconds. Then he\u2019s scrambling away, his head ducked and his eyes on the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens his mouth to \u2014 to apologize? To make excuses? Shame crowds his throat, thick and swampy. Even so, he can\u2019t apologize in all honesty \u2014 can\u2019t atone for the simple crime of wanting Wei Ying, as obvious as he is about it. Surely it\u2019s all split open now, the truth spilling in each direction like his viscera on display. Wei Wuxian must know what it means, the physical proof that Lan Wangji can be so undone at a single kiss from him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian says, still without looking at him, \u201cLots of beautiful women here, huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s either a defensive deflection, or a pointed reminder of where Wei Wuxian\u2019s preferences lie. Lan Wangji feels his heart sink, and he opens his mouth to respond, except the woman has now stopped in front of them in a cloud of fragrant perfume.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has not often engaged with women, the gender separation of his sect being what it is, but he has never seen a woman so close to undressed, not even in books. His cheeks prickle with an embarrassed heat. He\u2019s not often one to stand down or retreat from a fight, but this is new territory, one where his instincts beg him to flee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the woman senses Lan Wangji\u2019s discomfort, she either ignores it or simply doesn\u2019t care. She sizes him up, her eyes sweeping him from his guan to his shoes. Then her eyes lazily drift to Wei Wuxian, who\u2019s still holding himself rigid against the hallway wall. He\u2019s looking back and forth between the two of them with a tense, unhappy expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cXiao gege,\u201d she repeats, directing it at Wei Wuxian, who despite his boastful record on flirting, flushes bright red. Then the woman\u2019s voice sharpens, the flirtatious tone vanishing. \u201cA-Su said you wish to speak to one of my girls. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot for sex,\u201d Wei Wuxian blurts out, waving his hands in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m married! I just wanted to ask her about the incident that occurred here last night. We\u2019re cultivators and we\u2019re tracking the yaoguai causing the trouble. We already killed one of them just this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman\u2019s eyes narrow at him in suspicion. Then she casts her skepticism toward Lan Wangji, who still wants to shed his skin like a snake and wriggle away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing married has never stopped men here,\u201d she points out. \u201cEven esteemed cultivators. But I have not told anyone that it was a yaoguai that attacked A-Yan, so your skill in these matters must have led you here. I believe you. Come with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian won\u2019t look at Lan Wangji as he trails after her down the hallway. Queasiness tightens in Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach as he follows. Has he ruined everything between them, now, with his own foolish lack of control? He\u2019d thought...during the kiss, Wei Ying\u2019s enthusiasm, that maybe they both\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is thankfully distracted from this turmoil by the introduction of A-Yan, the young woman who had been attacked. She clearly and frankly details the events of what happened to her, her voice unwavering through her account, while Wei Wuxian nods along and asks her follow-up questions. Her shoulder has been wrapped in bandages from where the jueyuan had attacked her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After Wei Wuxian\u2019s last question, she tilts her chin away and stares coolly at the far wall, indicating through body language that she\u2019s finished speaking on the subject.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The owner leads them out without another word. Many of the women and some of the male patrons stare at the two of them on their way out with open curiosity; from his and Wei Wuxian\u2019s appearances and demeanors, it\u2019s glaringly obvious they are not the place\u2019s usual frequenters. Lan Wangji pays them no mind. His only object of focus is the line of Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders in front of him. He still has not looked at Lan Wangji since what happened in the hallway. Wei Wuxian, in their first months of knowing each other, had begged for Lan Wangji to look at him, for a simple glance from him, over and over. Lan Wangji had coldly refused him every time. He had known even then that if he started looking, he would be unable to stop. Perhaps he had also known what it would give away. He hadn\u2019t imagined, then, how thoroughly their positions could be reversed. How he would do anything, now, for a look from Wei Ying, something to prove they could return to how they were before the truth was known.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re outside, en route to the inn, Lan Wangji tries to speak business, at least, hoping to coax Wei Wuxian into conversation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think Yan-guniang\u2019s information gives us what we need to move forward?\u201d Lan Wangji asks Wei Wuxian\u2019s back, who pauses at the sound of his voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, still without turning. \u201cWe know now that the jueyuan is heading east, never sticking to one town for more than a night. It has no way of knowing we\u2019re onto it, so there\u2019s no reason for it to change course now. We can predict that tomorrow, it\u2019ll be either near Hanshan or Yi\u2019an.\u201d He pauses, then adds over his shoulder with strained lightness, \u201cWe could have stayed there longer, if you preferred.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns, confused by the question. \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRecreation,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. His tone is indifferent, but his shoulders are still tense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf what nature,\u201d Lan Wangji says slowly, disliking the implications of whatever Wei Wuxian is trying to say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waves a dismissive hand. He still hasn\u2019t turned to look at Lan Wangji. \u201cYou can just forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cold shift is so quick that Lan Wangji blinks at his husband\u2019s back, perplexed. Wei Wuxian stalks ahead, somewhere in the direction of their inn, without checking to see if Lan Wangji is behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had previously believed that his feelings have been, up to this point, fairly obvious. His eager reciprocation of Wei Wuxian\u2019s kiss had been anything but subtle. It is clear, by Wei Wuxian\u2019s reaction, that the knowledge has come as an unpleasant surprise to him. And moreso, that his...feelings are unwelcome.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even so, try as he might, Lan Wangji can\u2019t stop thinking about the kiss. Each time he replays it in his mind, he feels a rush of dizzying heat flood through him all over again. Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes had been half-shut as though in a dream. He had asked for more. His reaction then and his reaction now do not align. Surely Wei Wuxian wouldn't have reacted in such a way to being kissed if Lan Wangji's affections repulsed him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows around the thick feeling in his throat as he makes his way after Wei Wuxian, following him toward their sleeping quarters for the evening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t say a word to each other once they reach the inn, Lan Wangji following Wei Wuxian\u2019s cue as they move through their nighttime rituals. Once he\u2019s undressed, Wei Wuxian wriggles to the other side of the bed, his back facing Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji, in spite of his best efforts, had quickly developed a spousal reflex toward Wei Wuxian\u2019s unhappiness within their first days of marriage. It itches in him, the instinct to reach out, to say or do something to make his husband feel better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As of now, he is not certain that anything from him is welcome.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a very long time for Lan Wangji to fall asleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji wakes the next morning, Wei Wuxian is gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He permits himself a few moments to silently panic, but before he can do something uncharacteristically impulsive, like burst out into the inn\u2019s hallway to search for him, Wei Wuxian returns through the sliding door, nudging it shut behind him with his foot. His hands are full with two bowls of congee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d Wei Wuxian says cheerfully. He sounds as chipper as he ever does, but he won\u2019t meet Lan Wangji\u2019s eye. \u201cSorry I was rude to you yesterday! I don\u2019t always react well to being surprised, and I\u2026you sort of took me off-guard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprised,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats. Then says, \u201cWei Ying, at the brothel\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d Wei Wuxian jumps in with a manic quickness, his voice strident. He sets the two bowls down on the table with a clunk. \u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten about it! We did what we had to do to get information for a case, right? You don\u2019t even \u2014 we don\u2019t have to talk about it at all, or ever again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An acidic feeling sours in Lan Wangji like a ripe lemon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nods once with difficulty. \u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He still has barely looked at Lan Wangji, busying his hands with tidying up his belongings on the table that he\u2019d pulled out of his qiankun pouch. \u201cGreat! Glad that\u2019s settled. Now we can just focus on what needs to be done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That is probably best, at least for the time being. Lan Wangji nods, and follows suit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They spend the next few shichen milling around Qianshen, gathering information and keeping their conversation strictly about the case. The remaining jueyuan is evidently more cunning than either of them initially believed, but Wei Wuxian concludes it will probably make itself more visible in the evening after hiding out during the daylight hours. That leaves them little to do in the meantime, so they return to the inn earlier than planned following a brisk, quiet meal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian chatters about nothing of importance as they make their way to their room, a clear attempt to consciously fill space in a way that had never felt so strained before. It is nearly unbearable. Once they\u2019re inside, Wei Wuxian moves across the room, away from him, and Lan Wangji slides the door shut behind them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, staring after him as Wei Wuxian putters through his belongings with small, humming sounds. He is ultimately unable to resist one last attempt at amends, given the strange building of energy throughout the day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says. He moves away from the door to the opposite side of the room, granting Wei Wuxian a clear berth of space. \u201cI sincerely apologize for yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still bent over the table, Wei Wuxian blows out a fast breath, then scrubs a hand through his hair. \u201cI said we don\u2019t have to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe kiss was for the case,\u201d Wei Wuxian says to the table in a rehearsed tone. \u201cI already said it didn\u2019t have to mean anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. \u201cBut you are avoiding me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs, then finally turns toward Lan Wangji. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d He squeezes his eyes shut and pinches the bridge of his nose, one of his hands propped on his hip. \u201cWhat happened \u2014 at the brothel. In the hallway, I mean. I guess I didn\u2019t realize that you \u2014 that you were interested in...that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, Lan Wangji would be interested in anything from Wei Wuxian, but not if it warrants this degree of avoidance and disgust. Nothing is worth that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cOur partnership takes priority.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it matters!\u201d Wei Wuxian retorts. \u201cDo you think I want you to be miserable your entire life on my account?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot control how you feel,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly. \u201cI would not ask you to change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this, an expression of vague panic flickers across Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. He almost stumbles, moving closer to the door as though in retreat. \u201cHow I \u2014 feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have certain...preferences,\u201d Lan Wangji says, keeping his gaze lowered, \u201cthat I cannot help. I would not demand anything of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPreferences,\u201d Wei Wuxian echoes, then takes another step back. \u201cDid you.\u201d He pauses, then stares at Lan Wangji as though he\u2019s seeing him anew. \u201cDid you always know you \u2014 wanted that? Even when we got married?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It seems callous to make Lan Wangji say it. But he cannot deny Wei Wuxian the truth, now that it\u2019s been dragged into the light. Slowly, he nods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows, his eyebrows crooking together in confusion. \u201cWh\u2026why didn\u2019t you try to stop the wedding, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had not been sure it was possible to feel worse than he already did. His heart sinks lower and lower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly, unable to look Wei Wuxian in the eye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long, unending moment of silence that feels excruciating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA concubine,\u201d Wei Wuxian says abruptly, then stares at Lan Wangji like he\u2019s holding his breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Lan Wangji says, when it\u2019s clear that there will be no further clarification.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA concubine,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats, then looks somewhere beyond Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, a strange light to his expression. \u201cYou know that if you have...those kinds of needs \u2014 ah, preferences \u2014 I would be okay with it if you saw a concubine, um. I know you were forced into this with me, and I wouldn\u2019t expect you to\u2026to sacrifice your needs out of loyalty to me, when I\u2019m, I\u2019d really be okay with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps staring. For a peaceful moment, there\u2019s only a blank, white shock, like suspension in water. The crackle of anger that he feels, jagged and red, takes him off-guard with its force. For Wei Wuxian to dislike his feelings is one thing, but to suggest a corrective method feels insensibly cruel. Anger is easier than the hurt, which is staggering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I want that,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his teeth clenched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian startles at his expression. He skitters back a few steps like a spooked cat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He\u2019s gone very pale. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t interested in \u2014 in that, at all \u2014 after the wedding, the Lan doctors told me you were \u2014 that you had no interest in intimate, um, relations, but it\u2019s clear that you...that you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at Wei Wuxian for another speechless moment. His sect had told Wei Wuxian...what?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cClear that I do?\u201d he echoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the brothel,\u201d Wei Wuxian clarifies, which does not clarify anything. \u201cThe way that you...I could feel that you\u2026\u201d He struggles for words for a moment, though Lan Wangji can guess what he is trying to voice. The reaction is more modest than Lan Wangji would expect from him. Wei Wuxian finally throws up a hand and groans. \u201cYou <em> know </em> what I mean! When the brothel owner came over to us, I could feel the way it...affected you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can only stand there rooted to the spot, completely dumbfounded. In the mess of the past few days and his narrowed focus on Wei Ying, he\u2019d entirely managed to forget about the half-undressed woman before they\u2019d spoken to A-Yan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Had...had Wei Ying thought that\u2026?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no interest in women,\u201d Lan Wangji says blankly. \u201cOr concubines, or anyone outside of this marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands drop by his sides, and he gives Lan Wangji a look that can only be described as baffled. \u201cBut you\u2019re...you\u2019re not a cut-sleeve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is yet another moment of staring.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Lan Wangji says again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, the blood returning to his face as he begins to pace in a small, agitated circle. \u201cLan Zhan, you wouldn\u2019t even touch me on our <em>wedding night, </em>you would barely look at me. There were other \u2014 other times, where I tried to see if maybe you...but you never\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something between them has been so impossibly misconstrued that Lan Wangji isn\u2019t certain where to begin untangling it, where the gnarl of it even begins. He\u2019s of a split mind as to which is more upsetting \u2014 the fact that he\u2019s been so fundamentally misunderstood by the person closest to him, or the fact that Wei Wuxian would apparently, by his own admission, be apathetic to the prospect of Lan Wangji pursuing random women. There\u2019s too much hurt tangled up in the latter, so he focuses on the first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no interest in women in that way,\u201d he says again, because that\u2019s the easiest and most straightforward point to address. \u201cI never have, and I never will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, a little hysterically, \u201cthis is an <em> entirely </em>different conversation than the one we just had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe...preferences I spoke of.\u201d Lan Wangji pauses, then swallows his own misgivings. \u201cThey are exclusively the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201coh,\u201d then simply stares at Lan Wangji for a very long time, his mouth ajar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can only stand there frozen, his heart beating very fast in his chest as he waits for what Wei Wuxian will say next.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. So, you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says slowly. \u201cWhen we kissed, you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In any other circumstance, it would seem as though Wei Wuxian is deliberately trying to humiliate him, but it\u2019s clear from his face that he\u2019s genuinely piecing something together. Something that Lan Wangji had thought, up until now, was excruciatingly evident.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then tentatively makes his way across the room toward him. Some of his anger lingers, but he isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s targeted at Wei Wuxian or self-directed. He\u2019s made his feelings as clear as he knows how to, in the ways that he\u2019s equipped to, since he realized how he felt. Perhaps even before. Could Wei Ying really misinterpret them so deeply?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks back, suddenly, to what Wei Wuxian had said, moments ago. That there had been moments, when he\u2019d tried to...what? Gauge Lan Wangji\u2019s interest in men? Has he himself been so oblivious? Certain moments take on a new coloring, with these words: Wei Wuxian climbing him in the lake in Lotus Pier. Wei Wuxian standing before him naked on that stormy night, watching him expressionlessly, almost assessingly. To...see how he\u2019d react? To see, perhaps, if Lan Wangji desired him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course he had. He simply had never imagined that...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it true, what the Lan doctors said,\u201d Wei Wuxian says suddenly. His eyes don\u2019t linger anywhere for long, skipping from Lan Wangji\u2019s face to the wall beyond his shoulder to his shoes. \u201cAbout intimate. Relations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes another few steps closer. Wei Wuxian falters a few steps back in response, though it does not seem like a retreat. He keeps backing up, Lan Wangji advancing until Wei Wuxian\u2019s back is against the sliding door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey gave me suppressants,\u201d Wei Wuxian blurts out, then the knot of his throat bobs in a quick little swallow. \u201cYour sect doctors. They said it might make it more comfortable for me long-term, if you weren\u2019t interested in\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is very close now. He can almost feel the rapid patter of Wei Wuxian\u2019s pulse. There\u2019s the scent and warmth of him, the tiny jumps in the visible vein under his neck, the flush in his cheeks. His eyes are wide, a little dazed, asking for something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you take them?\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks, then gives a rapid shake of his head. \u201cN-no, no. It didn\u2019t feel right to, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Wei Wuxian echoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cDoes Wei Ying also have needs unattended to?\u201d His voice is pitched so low. He\u2019s so close to touching him, to snapping through the last gossamer-thin threads of his self-control.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s blush has a palpable heat. He\u2019s pink from his neck all the way up to his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s really fine, I\u2019ve \u2014 been taking care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hot flash rocks through Lan Wangji at the notion of this. \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian squirms his back against the door as though he might try to get away. \u201cIt\u2019s really not \u2014 uhhhh, I mean, it\u2019s not really important \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An ugly, barbed thought occurs to Lan Wangji then, so repellant that he nearly snarls the question. \u201cAnd does Wei Ying have interest in concubines?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian watches him closely, his eyes flickering over Lan Wangji\u2019s features with his mouth parted. Lan Wangji is too tightly wound to feel embarrassed by whatever obvious emotion Wei Wuxian must see there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then tilts his head, his lips ticking at the corner. His nerve to be insolent, right now, when Lan Wangji is so close to careening over a ledge of no return. \u201cHaha, Lan Zhan, if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think you were drinking vineg \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji, all at once, loses any remnants of his patience. He grabs Wei Wuxian by the hips, ignoring the responding yelp, and flips him around, crushes him against the door and pins him there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian chokes, a shallow wheeze around the squished shape of his cheek smashed against the door-screen. \u201cWh-wh \u2014 you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Lan Wangji says, closing his eyes as he attempts to brace his control. Wei Wuxian\u2019s ass is flush against his groin, pressed tight against where Lan Wangji is already hard to the point of pain. Wei Wuxian can feel it too, by the way he squirms and pushes back further onto his tiptoes. \u201cDo not mention concubines again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll what,\u201d Wei Wuxian fires over his shoulder, then gives a breathy, disbelieving little laugh as Lan Wangji crushes him harder against the door-screen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d he gasps out, planting his hands flat against the door-screen in an attempt to push back. \u201cFor weeks I\u2019ve been trying to get my husband\u2019s attention, and all it took was making you mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you think about,\u201d Lan Wangji says against his ear, which is flushed red with heat. He bites down on the lobe, and Wei Wuxian yelps and squirms again, grinding back against Lan Wangji harder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ah</em>, mmmm, uhhh...what did I think about...when?\u201d Wei Wuxian stalls, panting. Lan Wangji can feel the thundering of Wei Wuxian\u2019s heartbeat through his back, through his layers \u2014 adrenaline, fear, arousal, it\u2019s hard to say which.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bites his ear harder, gripping Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips hard enough to bruise and pushing his back into a deeper arch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ah!! </em> Stop, stop, okay!\u201d Wei Wuxian cries, then finishes, more calmly, \u201cI usually think about concubi \u2014 I\u2019m kidding, <em> I\u2019m kidding!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This has always been Wei Wuxian\u2019s problem, Lan Wangji thinks as an animalistic urge drives him forward, as halfway through Wei Wuxian\u2019s sentence he circles his hand over the hard bulge tenting the front of Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes and grips him tight enough to hurt, tight enough for Wei Wuxian to give a wild sound, to wheeze wetly and scramble back against him: He never knows when to quit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, Hanguang-jun,\u201d Wei Wuxian chants, breathless and high-pitched, \u201cmercy, please, mercy \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Lan Wangji demands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian slaps one hand weakly against the door-screen as Lan Wangji\u2019s hand cups the firm, clothed shape of his cock, surely sensitive enough to chafe against his robes. Wei Wuxian is hard too, fully so \u2014 how long has he \u2014 ?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan \u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian is panting, dazed-sounding. \u201cI \u2014 don\u2019t, you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wei Ying.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, <em> fine</em>, I thought about you, I thought about you,\u201d Wei Wuxian moans, a near-sob, rocking himself against Lan Wangji\u2019s hand. \u201cLan Zhan, L-Lan Zhan, whenever I touched myself I thought about you like this, what you would do to me, how much you could fill me up \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji yanks on his shoulder to spin him around, causing Wei Wuxian to stumble and jag sideways, and then they\u2019re kissing, hard enough that the thud of Wei Wuxian\u2019s body hitting the door-screen shakes it. It\u2019s not a clean kiss, or a nice one. Lan Wangji is all teeth, desperate and frustrated and pent-up from <em> wanting. </em>He can feel that he\u2019s too rough; too wild to mind his own strength, to rein himself in as he usually would. Wei Wuxian shakes him out of that carefully curated control, over and over and over again. Now that Lan Wangji has him, he cannot stop, kissing him hard enough to hurt, to bruise. He rolls Wei Wuxian\u2019s soft bottom lip between his teeth, soothes the pinch of it with his tongue, Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands in his hair and Wei Wuxian\u2019s spit in his mouth. He can keep Wei Wuxian here just like this, consume him until he\u2019s as integral as an organ, brambled tight in Lan Wangji\u2019s love until he becomes it. His thoughts slide sideways \u2014 not thinking straight, not making sense, the sting of their mouths meeting over and over, Wei Ying \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, breathe,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, a grounding hand to his cheek. \u201cSlow down, gege, breathe, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says hoarsely, and he shuts his eyes. He realizes that he\u2019s shaking. He does breathe, some of the wild, frayed edges in him smoothing over at Wei Wuxian\u2019s touch. He can feel the stiff, hot line of Wei Wuxian\u2019s erection digging into his hip. His own trousers are wet, sticky and clinging in the most uncomfortable places. His head spins, the features of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face blurring in proximity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says softly, kissing his mouth once, twice, a little clumsily, and then his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji will want gentleness, at some point, but not now. There\u2019s a restless itch in him he\u2019s been unable to scratch for weeks, for much longer than that, and he thinks Wei Wuxian might be merciful enough, might care for him enough, to allow for it. To want it in return. He pins Wei Wuxian back against the door, his teeth finding his lower lip again. Wei Wuxian hums sweetly against his mouth, his arms tightening around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted you then,\u201d Lan Wangji says before he can rethink honesty, and is rewarded by the hitch in Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath, close enough to his mouth that he feels it. \u201cOur wedding night. Before. Every day after.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks at him, his eyes overbright with feeling, his lips swollen. Lan Wangji is going to ruin him. Or, perhaps, be ruined, his elders\u2019 prophecy at last fulfilled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell were you waiting for?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, tipping his chin up in a small challenge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji finds his mouth again, easier than each time before. Easier and easier, with practice. They\u2019re still kissing even as Lan Wangji pulls Wei Wuxian away from the entrance, maneuvering them in the general direction of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhh, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says when they part for air, hooking his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. He talks low, his eyelashes sultry and batting. \u201cEr-gege. Do you know how long I\u2019ve wanted to get naked with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji grabs Wei Wuxian by the hips, steadying himself. His voice is rough when he speaks. \u201cHow long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wei Wuxian blinks, pink-cheeked, like he hadn\u2019t been fully expecting the follow-up question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow \u2014\u201d Lan Wangji bites Wei Wuxian\u2019s lip, hard. \u201c \u2014long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, muffled, then sucks his lower lip back into his mouth. He somehow manages to look pouty regardless. \u201cS-since that summer, I think, in Cold Spring. At the time I thought I was just \u2014 really curious, but I just wanted to see your \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tightens his grip on Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist hard enough that Wei Wuxian yelps, wriggling and whining in his grasp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were infuriating,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly, and kisses his pink, pink mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes against his lips. \u201cWasn\u2019t it sexy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bites his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gives a winded, wheezing laugh. \u201cYou know they all told me you were <em> frigid, </em> ahaha, hah \u2014 of course I believed them, with all of that ice and that <em> face \u2014 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tears at Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes with a sudden flash of impatience, his strength such that he rips the fabric from neck to navel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, don\u2019t!\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps, and uselessly pulls one scrap back up over his exposed shoulder like a scandalized maiden. \u201cYou\u2019ll ruin them \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji ignores the protests, stripping Wei Wuxian\u2019s belt away so it falls to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bought these for me,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles into his neck, sounding delirious. He clings onto Lan Wangji's shoulders and pants as Lan Wangji tears at his clothes. \u201cLan Zhan, I \u2014 I really liked it when you bought them for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan buy more,\u201d Lan Wangji points out, and he manhandles Wei Wuxian toward the bed, who\u2019s halfway out of his zhongyi by now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bites kisses down the arch of his neck to the top of his exposed shoulder, greedy. Wei Wuxian tips his head back toward the ceiling and gasps for breath, his eyes closed as Lan Wangji sucks bruises into the column of his throat. His fingernails dig harder into the backs of Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders, gripping on like he\u2019s trying to anchor himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does it compare,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs into the next kiss, curious and a little anxious to know the answer. He cannot imagine anything could be better than this, but he would like to match up to Wei Wuxian\u2019s prior experience, in whatever way he can.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Wei Wuxian says distractedly, preoccupied with the task of necking him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo the others,\u201d Lan Wangji clarifies. He closes his eyes at the sensation of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth on his skin, more sensitive in this area than he could have believed. \u201cThe others you\u2019ve been with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a sound against Lan Wangji\u2019s neck that\u2019s hard to decipher. When Lan Wangji glances down to assess him, Wei Wuxian has stopped what he\u2019s doing, reflecting his look with a strange expression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait...do you really think I\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his eyebrows raising.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji waits for him to finish, not understanding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, the sound bursting out of him in a bray of sound. His shoulders start to shake with it. \u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Lan Wangji says flatly, wondering if he\u2019s being teased and wondering if his irritation at the fact will win out over the haze of lust begging him to eat Wei Wuxian alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been with anyone,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He tilts his head at Lan Wangji, his eyes bright with mirth. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even kissed anyone, before yesterday. Lan Zhan, what dirty thoughts have you been keeping about me? That you really thought that I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said,\u201d Lan Wangji says blankly. \u201cThat you had\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian winds his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, his smirk widening. \u201cLan Zhan ah, you\u2019re so cute to have believed such a thing! I\u2019m better at bullshitting than I thought.\u201d He frowns and rubs at his chin, looking thoughtful. \u201cNo, I really haven\u2019t done anything with anyone at all. I, ah, wanted to wait to...I guess I was waiting for\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji attacks his mouth again; there\u2019s not a more graceful way to describe it. Wei Wuxian laughs into it then hums, his arms tightening around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck as he pushes back into the kiss with equal enthusiasm. Lan Wangji is \u2014 aggravated, a little, to have been goaded in such a way and with such clear glee, but mostly just hungry, hungrier than any spell of inedia has ever rendered him. He is Wei Ying\u2019s only, as Wei Ying is his. His <em> first </em> and only.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of Wei Wuxian\u2019s clothes fall away easily after that. Or maybe with difficulty, maybe with struggled, gentle laughter. It\u2019s hard to say, in the moment or after. The end result is the same, which is Wei Wuxian left entirely bare, stumbling back onto the bed when the backs of his knees hit the mattress.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is useless to do anything but stare. He snags on each physical detail of Wei Ying like snarls in a fishing line: his dark, hard nipples. The soft, sweet fold of his belly. His ribs and his bruised knees. His cock against his navel, lovely and flushed dark. Elbow and ankle and the bronze of his skin in the late afternoon sunlight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Propped on his elbows, Wei Wuxian preens under the attention. He rocks one knee back and forth, making the hard length of his cock sway. \u201cEnjoying the view?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian almost sounds nervous, beneath the leering bravado. As though the question might be genuine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, and Wei Wuxian perhaps isn\u2019t expecting his sincerity because he turns a brighter shade of pink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji moves forward to touch him, but Wei Wuxian plants one foot to the center of his chest to keep him at bay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji glances down at the insolent foot, an eyebrow raised.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot until you strip too,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then tilts his head with a winsome smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just looks at him, then grips Wei Wuxian by the ankle, possibly a little too hard. Wei Wuxian squeaks and tries to kick out of his grasp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhaaaaan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines as Lan Wangji pulls him down the length of the bed by his ankle. \u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026!! Can\u2019t I ask to see my husband naked?! Is that such an outlandish request? Why do you get to wear all your clothes and I don\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stops pulling once Wei Wuxian is within arm\u2019s reach. \u201cYou do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks up at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUndress me,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice low. \u201cHusband.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes widen, and then he\u2019s scrambling up onto his knees and pulling Lan Wangji forward by the front of his robes. He begins to disrobe him swiftly, almost manically, pushing at the fine silk on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSlower,\u201d Lan Wangji commands, even though anticipation makes his heart race, his impatience threatening to swallow him. Wei Wuxian is \u2014 very naked, and very hard, and very close within reach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan! You tease.\u201d Wei Wuxian gives a low, disbelieving laugh and a shake of his head, but he does what he\u2019s told. His touch slows, gentles. Then he murmurs, almost as though to himself, \u201cAs it should have been, when\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, closing his eyes. That first night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s focus shifts, strangely reverent as he removes each piece of clothing with more care than before. His eyes are so dark that Lan Wangji can nearly see himself reflected in them; a pale shard, a crescent moon. Wei Wuxian runs a light hand down Lan Wangji\u2019s bare chest once the final robe falls away, tracing his abdominal muscles to his waistband. He bites his lip and reddens again when he reaches the distended bulge tenting Lan Wangji\u2019s trousers, the damp fabric clinging very obviously to the shape of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trousers are the last to go, easy to divest, and Lan Wangji steps out of them, one foot after the other, as they pool to the floor. It is oddly far from awkward, to be naked under Wei Wuxian\u2019s scrutiny.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is still chewing on his lip, eyeing Lan Wangji\u2019s cock like it\u2019s a poisonous snake. He brings one flustered hand to his face as if to cover it from view, then he drops it again. Almost trancelike, Wei Wuxian reaches out as though to touch, and Lan Wangji grabs him fast by the wrist, tight enough that he feels the bone creak. Wei Wuxian exclaims in protest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs breathlessly, his eyes widening as he sways in Lan Wangji\u2019s grip. \u201cYou really <em> are </em>a tease. Lan Zhan, is this doing something for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pushes him onto the bed in lieu of an answer, chasing the giggles out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth all the way down. When Wei Wuxian is pinned flat, Lan Wangji presses forward, riding his cock against the flat of his belly. Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes flutter shut, his breath parted around a moan. Lan Wangji does it again, bowing into the pleasure of it, the sweet sounds Wei Wuxian makes when his neck is bitten or kissed. It\u2019s as alien as it is instinctive, this hunger to make Wei Wuxian feel good, to pleasure him beyond all remaining coherence or reason. He wants to make him feel good every day for the rest of their lives. He would give him everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji starts with one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s nipples, circling his tongue over and over again even as Wei Wuxian says <em> ah </em> and arches against him, his fingers twisted in Lan Wangji\u2019s hair. He\u2019s sensitive here. Very sensitive. Wei Wuxian is harder than before, leaking against both of their stomachs. His cock twitches against Lan Wangji with each pass of his tongue, each small, bullying bite. He\u2019s making desperate, whining sounds like he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s making them, his fingers clenching in and out of the sheets and his toes curling. It\u2019s a promising response for what else will come.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s satisfied with the treatment, Lan Wangji nips sharp kisses down his sternum, down and down where Wei Wuxian is all heat and hardness, the hair between his legs sticky and a little matted with precome. Desire grants Lan Wangji brazen confidence and a surprising assuredness; desire, and impatience after years of picturing this very thing. He kisses the head of Wei Wuxian\u2019s cock in a chaste greeting, then swallows him down to the root, only twice \u2014 just to get acquainted, just to feel the way the hot length of him jerks and hardens further inside his mouth, to hear Wei Wuxian hoarsely shout his name. Then he pulls off and carries on, biting at the insides of Wei Wuxian\u2019s inner thighs as he continues his descent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMean,\u201d Wei Wuxian pants. He\u2019s not selling coyness at all, entirely wanting and wanton, all of his performances left bare. \u201cLan Zhan, oh, please \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s thighs are trembling on either side of Lan Wangji\u2019s head. He has a fist to his mouth, his eyes squeezed shut like he\u2019s trying to control himself. Lan Wangji had expected many things from Wei Wuxian in bed, the many times he\u2019d fantasized about it, but he hadn\u2019t expected him to be so...innocent, when it came to being touched like this. Like every sensation is new and overwhelming. It\u2019s as arousing as it is endearing. It makes it all the more real. Wei Ying is flesh and blood and wanting and independent of Lan Wangji\u2019s suppositions, not the pale mimicry in a fantasy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It also makes him incredibly impatient. Lan Wangji abandons his exploration at Wei Wuxian\u2019s ankle and rises up to direct Wei Wuxian into flipping over onto his hands and knees. Wei Wuxian goes easily, as easily as he had that first night, which exposes an entirely new canvas of bare skin to drink in \u2014 the mountain slopes of his shoulders; faded whip scars; the endearing dimples at the small of his back, pronounced enough to fit the shape of Lan Wangji\u2019s thumbs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to breathe steady, running a hand slowly down the curve of Wei Wuxian\u2019s spine; the baby hairs along the back of his bare thigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmurs, cupping one round swell of Wei Wuxian\u2019s backside. Paler here than the rest of him, the skin whitening further when gripped and squeezed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cF-for what?\u201d Wei Wuxian says weakly. He seems to have suddenly remembered his modesty, as though this new position has made him shy. He attempts to shuffle his spread knees closer together, though he doesn\u2019t recoil from Lan Wangji\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor not giving my husband what he needed,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and with the tip of his finger, he circles Wei Wuxian\u2019s hole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian jolts at the touch, his fingers scrabbling to get a tighter grip on the bedsheets. He sounds dazed when he speaks again. \u201cWh-what do I \u2014 what did I need?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t answer in words. Angling his hips forward, he guides the head of his cock to align with Wei Wuxian\u2019s entrance, pushing past the rim so it stretches and flutters around him. The fit is too tight, dry with so little preparation, but not impossible. Wei Wuxian spits out a curse and moans harshly. He attempts to shove his hips back, then forward, to either take Lan Wangji\u2019s cock deeper or to escape it, but Lan Wangji holds him by the waist firmly, trapping him in place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines, clenching down around the head of his cock in small spasms. \u201cEr-gege, you\u2019re so cruel, how could you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji starts to fuck him in tiny, shallow, grinding circles, never pushing past the tip of his cock; light thrusts in and out, just enough to breach him over and over, to get him wet with precome. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s been possessed by something, a wolfish creature beneath his skin whose instincts direct him beyond gentleness, beyond greenness. Sensation curls at the base of his spine, heavy and simmering, but he can wait, for now. Wei Ying needs something out of his system as much as Lan Wangji does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is nearly hysterical above him, tiny, broken <em> ah ah ah </em>sounds punched out of him with each thrust that surely anyone sharing a wall with them can hear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan, please,\u201d he begs as he tries to fuck himself backward, \u201cI, I need to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this not enough?\u201d Lan Wangji wonders. He reaches down to circle the pad of his finger around Wei Wuxian\u2019s rim, where it\u2019s stretched pink around the head of his cock. Wei Wuxian jerks like he\u2019s been slapped, and Lan Wangji feels him come, wailing as he desperately tries to push himself deeper onto Lan Wangji\u2019s cock. Lan Wangji holds him tightly in place, a savage satisfaction arcing through him as he fucks Wei Wuxian through it as shallowly as he can manage, just the push of the head of his cock in and out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grants Wei Wuxian one moment after to collapse against the bed onto his stomach, his hips still tilted up; one moment of reprieve to gasp through the shudders still trembling through him. And then he reaches around Wei Wuxian\u2019s front, feeling his way with his hand. Wei Wuxian\u2019s belly is streaked wet with his own spend, although most of it had been caught by the sheets. Lan Wangji swipes a hand through the worst of the mess. He keeps the tip of his cock inside Wei Wuxian as he slicks up the rest of his shaft, ignoring the way Wei Wuxian groans and shudders again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he wheezes, craning his neck to look over his shoulder with wide, disbelieving eyes, \u201cLan Zhan, did you really just \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a slow, smooth thrust, Lan Wangji fucks into Wei Wuxian to the hilt, even as Wei Wuxian yelps like a puppy. This, now, is what Lan Wangji needs. Or perhaps a need they share.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lan Zhan,</em>\u201d Wei Wuxian moans, his head dropping between his shoulders. \u201cI-I-I \u2014 you <em> can\u2019t, </em> when I just \u2014 you\u2019re so, have mercy, you feel so \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji rocks into him, as deep as he can reach at this angle. Deep enough that a joint shudder rocks through the both of them. He leans over Wei Wuxian\u2019s back and finds his cock with his other hand, already halfway to hard. Maybe he hadn\u2019t gone fully soft, after that first orgasm. He traps the length of it against Wei Wuxian\u2019s stomach, pinning it there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s frigid,\u201d he says, and pulls out for the purpose of fucking in again, hard enough that Wei Wuxian\u2019s back arches at an alarming angle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zh\u2014 </em>\u201d Wei Wuxian chokes. His cock throbs in Lan Wangji\u2019s hand, blood-hot and growing harder by the second. \u201cWh\u2014what are you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho said I was frigid,\u201d Lan Wangji grits out. In a simultaneous movement, he grinds his cock forward in a deep thrust, twisting the head of Wei Wuxian\u2019s cock in his fist. Wei Wuxian promptly chokes on his own spit and spends the next few seconds hacking for air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cN-no one,\u201d Wei Wuxian babbles, hardly coherent, shaking hard enough that his elbows and knees almost give way. Sweat has gathered along the nape of his neck, trailing down the ravine between his shoulder blades. \u201cI-I never believed them, I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Lan Wangji counters softly. He bites at the back of his neck, the bridge of his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I was wrong, laoshi, Lan er-gege \u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian is still trembling, on the verge of tears as he babbles. Oh; Lan Wangji hadn\u2019t imagined he would cry. He feels himself grow impossibly harder inside \u2014 inside \u2014 Wei Ying, and he drops his head, his mouth falling open around a helpless groan. For a moment, his control slips, the overwhelming tide of it crashing around him; the reality of this, of Wei Ying gorgeous and pleasure-addled and so, so desperate for anything he\u2019s given.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so big,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles in a soft rapidfire into the pillow, \u201cyou\u2019re so thick, Lan Zhan, ah, ah, it hurts, it <em> hurts</em>, how could you treat your husband so \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHurts?\u201d Lan Wangji echoes. He slows the pace of his thrusts just a little, although he does not make a move to pull out. He can\u2019t tell if he means good-hurt or bad-hurt, and he\u2019s found there\u2019s an important distinction with Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you <em> stop</em>!\u201d Wei Wuxian wails furiously, answering his question. He digs his face into the pillow and moans as he clenches down. \u201cI need, I need \u2014 I\u2019m close, gege, I\u2019m close, I\u2019m closeI\u2019mcloseI\u2019mclose \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is. Already, again. Lan Wangji can feel that much from his grip on Wei Wuxian\u2019s cock, leaking over his knuckles, dripping down to the sheets. No relief quite yet, though \u2014 Lan Wangji wants to come inside him while Wei Wuxian is still hard, to push him over that final edge without a hand on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wants to see him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pulls out, for long enough that Wei Wuxian cries out again in outrage as Lan Wangji turns him over by the hips. Wei Wuxian fights him a little, as though on reflex, struggling against his hold with harmless, ineffective slaps against Lan Wangji\u2019s hands and arms. Like he had in the lake, Lan Wangji gathers both of Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists in one hand, pinning them above his head to immobilize him. Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes are glazed and dark, the color in his eyes eclipsed. His chest rises and falls rapidly, his mouth parted as he pants. A bead of sweat trickles down his temple. Lan Wangji had marked him up thoroughly on his first pass, purpling marks scattered along the smooth planes of his chest. His nipples are still swollen and dark, his cock flushed and hard against his belly, dripping steadily. He\u2019s beautiful enough that it almost hurts to look at him directly, but not the same hurt as before. Not the hurt of not having; not the hurt of wanting. The hurt of having and still wanting beyond reason. Of loving someone to the point of incoherence, of madness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, dazed. He's looking back at whatever picture Lan Wangji makes. Seeing him, too. \u201cOh, Lan Zhan, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji presses his forehead against Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek, breathing in the heat rising off his skin. Wei Wuxian is slick everywhere between his legs. It makes it easy for Lan Wangji to slide back inside, both of them groaning in relief, and then Lan Wangji resumes his pace, a deep and steady grind rather than a shallow hammering. As if on instinct, Wei Wuxian\u2019s knees spring up to bracket Lan Wangji\u2019s ribs, folded nearly to his chest as he opens himself up further. It doesn\u2019t take long to find the right angle to make Wei Wuxian senseless; a simple adjustment of his hips, and then a driving so hard that sweat drips down his back with exertion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, that\u2019s it, yeah, good boy, so good,\u201d Wei Wuxian is rambling and panting, \u201cLan Zhan, er-gege, lao gong, I want to feel it when you come inside me, I want to make you come, I want you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A wordless sound rises unbidden in Lan Wangji\u2019s throat, inhuman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop talking,\u201d he grits out a moment later, when he\u2019s capable of speaking. If Wei Wuxian wants this to last any longer, he needs to \u2014 to stop saying such things, when Lan Wangji is one word from losing his grip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian ignores him entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it feel good,\u201d he breathes against Lan Wangji\u2019s temple, over the slap of their bodies meeting, so...so obscenely loud. The entire bed is creaking, the headboard rutting against the wall in rhythmic bangs. Wei Wuxian\u2019s fingernails are digging into Lan Wangji\u2019s back, a grounding, the sweaty slide of his inner thighs rubbing against Lan Wangji\u2019s sides. \u201cLan Zhan, does it feel good inside me? Tell me, tell me how good it feels \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So good. He might say that part out loud. So <em> tight, </em>Wei Ying like a vice around him, a body trying to make room for him. He\u2019s so close to release that it rides an edge of pain, hard enough to hurt, intense enough that it feels too big under his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet it go, sweetheart,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, almost a whisper. His open mouth is damp against Lan Wangji\u2019s cheek as he pants, his voice so soft it aches. \u201cLan Zhan, fill me up, don\u2019t stop until I\u2019m full \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The suddenness of his orgasm nearly blinds him, and with it, Lan Wangji yields the last of his control. For the first time in his life, he gives his body entirely over to feeling. He sinks his teeth into Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder as he does, an intended kiss that instead sharpens and latches. It nearly deafens him, nearly drowns out the racket Wei Ying makes as he follows him. Lan Wangji has never come for so long, unending pulses of his cock as he empties himself into Wei Wuxian; enough to fill him to the brim, enough that Lan Wangji\u2019s spend sluggishly leaks out around his cock still inside him. It\u2019s inconceivably dirty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It is allowed, </em> he reminds himself, breathing through the last of his aftershocks. A warm, overwhelming feeling spindles through him like a surge of qi through his meridians. Wei Ying, Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a very long time, they remain unmoving as they resettle into their bodies, silent except their shocked, ragged breathing. Lan Wangji\u2019s cock, mostly soft, is still buried inside Wei Wuxian, and Wei Wuxian makes no move to free himself. So finally, reluctantly, Lan Wangji pulls out. A gush of come follows after, soaking into the sheets. Wei Wuxian\u2019s second release had caught both of them, their stomachs and chests and even the underside of Lan Wangji\u2019s chin. He had known, in theory, that sex is a messy affair, but the reality of it is somewhat overwhelming. To rectify it, he pushes the worst of the mess back inside Wei Wuxian\u2019s loose hole with his fingers. Wei Wuxian moans softly in shock, but is evidently too weak to protest, or to move at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta make sure it takes,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles. Lan Wangji huffs out a breath and shakes his head, ignoring the way his spent cock twitches at the words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, and presses a trail of kisses across his collarbone. His swollen lips sting with the salt from Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSoooo good,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles, his eyes still closed. \u201cAh, Lan Zhan. You...you were right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight?\u201d Lan Wangji wonders. He pauses in his touches to close his eyes and breathe into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hairline, sweat and soap mingled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did need that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says hoarsely, then gives a small, giddy, disbelieving laugh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShameless,\u201d Lan Wangji breathes against his ear, just to feel Wei Wuxian squirm and shiver harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s the shameless one, Lan er-gongzi?\u201d Wei Wuxian teases right back, still breathless. \u201cThe tales I could tell now, of Hanguang-jun\u2019s mighty sword. Maidens far and wide would swoon on their feet to know its prowess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, pressing the sword in question against Wei Wuxian\u2019s navel. Another full-body shudder travels through Wei Wuxian, and he opens his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, they only stare at each other. It's been several minutes now since they finished, but Lan Wangji finds himself winded still, not enough air in his lungs. Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheeks are cherry-red, a rashy flush along his chest and neck. Two coin-sized hickies are starting to bruise on his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Wei Wuxian says dreamily. He curls his arms up over his head in a way that\u2019s clearly supposed to be coquettish and is very much effective in the task. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty good at that, huh?\u201d He flutters his eyelashes coyly, crossing his wrists over his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you would be so fierce in bed, Lan er-gege.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying asked for it,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, and pins his wrists against the headboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes curve into smiling half-moons. Lan Wangji loves him from every chamber of his heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so I, ah, have a confession,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, wriggling his wrists under Lan Wangji\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji simply looks at him and waits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I \u2014 no, I <em> know </em> that I\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian bites his lip, blanching the skin. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been. Opposed. If we did that on our wedding night.\u201d To Lan Wangji\u2019s silence, he adds, \u201cEven then, not just in hindsight. I...I thought, at the time, that I didn\u2019t want to. I was so nervous. But then when you went to bed without touching me, I was\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian gives a small, disbelieving laugh. \u201cI was disappointed? I was also <em> insulted.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cInsulted,\u201d Lan Wangji echoes, thinking of Wei Wuxian that first night. How Wei Ying would have allowed him to take like this, even then.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I was!\u201d Wei Wuxian says with faux indignation. \u201cHere I was all trussed up, ready to be <em> had </em>on my wedding night, and all you did was, \u2018Mn, good night, Wei Ying,\u2019 and then went to sleep!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is not quite smiling, but it\u2019s a near thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI really was laying up churning over it, wondering if you didn\u2019t think I was attractive enough to sleep with even upon pain of marriage. I was so mad about it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have had you,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, lowering his voice. An understatement. \u201cSeveral times over. You were beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian huffs, still feigning outrage despite the deepening color in his cheeks. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s voice comes softly. \u201cYou seemed afraid. It was already a situation you did not choose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian groans. \u201cOf course you were too noble to fuck the jitters out of me. That\u2019s so infuriatingly <em>Lan Zhan</em> of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji kisses his jaw, then his cheek, simply for the fact that he can. Wei Wuxian catches his mouth on the next kiss, and they\u2019re quiet again for another few moments, save for the sticky sounds of their lips catching over and over; their measured, muffled breathing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI also have a confession,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs when they finally pull apart to catch their breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Wei Wuxian says in surprise, propping himself up further on an elbow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, slowly parsing through how he wants to say what he needs to. His heart starts to beat faster in his chest with anticipation. He fixes his focus on a freckle on Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest rather than meeting his curious stare. He is uncertain how Wei Wuxian will react to what he\u2019s about to admit, but it is something he feels should be known between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Jiangs\u2019 proposal,\u201d Lan Wangji says eventually. His mouth feels dry. \u201cI agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian goes silent for a moment, digesting this. \u201cMeaning\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI chose,\u201d Lan Wangji clarifies, still unable to meet Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou...were given the option to refuse,\u201d Wei Wuxian says slowly. His tone is hard to read, so Lan Wangji finally chances a glance at his husband\u2019s face. Wei Wuxian\u2019s brow is furrowed as though he\u2019s confused, but he does not look angry or upset.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The notch between Wei Wuxian\u2019s brows deepens. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji exhales, a little unevenly. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks at this, his eyes flaring wider. Then he says, with a low, whetted intensity, \u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, his eyes fluttering shut. Such a conversation is not first nature to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, please,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, more softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji picks his words with care, each syllable enunciated. \u201cI could not bear the idea of seeing you with anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian exhales like he\u2019s taken a blow, then his hand is slipping under Lan Wangji\u2019s jaw, tilting his face up into a short but fierce kiss. Lan Wangji yields easily, pushing off the mattress to press back into it. He\u2019s a little surprised by the reaction, but the overwhelming relief of it takes precedence. He couldn\u2019t have been certain that it wouldn\u2019t be too much for Wei Ying, to know the depth and length of his feelings. If he would resent the choice Lan Wangji had made for both of them. It would have been his right to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wei Wuxian says when he pulls back, and makes a show of trying to play off emotion as he smacks Lan Wangji\u2019s chest once. \u201cI\u2019m really...hmm. I\u2019m really glad that you. Ah. That you agreed to putting up with me. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not lie,\u201d Lan Wangji returns quietly, \u201cwhen I said I have wanted you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian breathes out slowly, a little shaky. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm?\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. His lashes tremble as he closes his eyes. \u201cAnother thing I should probably say, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hums to prompt him to continue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2026\u201d One of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands curls up, hesitantly, to stroke the back of Lan Wangji\u2019s head, running his fingers through the strands. He looks Lan Wangji in the eye, tentative but heartfelt. \u201cI think I might really, actually be in love with you. I think I\u2019m still in the falling part. I mean, it\u2019s just that...I...every time I look at you, I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji kisses him. Hurriedly, soundly, muffling the rest of whatever he would say. Wei Wuxian laughs into it, maybe a little startled, maybe a little relieved. They get lost for a while, exploring each other\u2019s mouths with tongues and teeth, what feels good and what does not. They still have so much to learn. Wei Ying\u2019s feelings for him \u2014 that, too, is a newness, exhilarating and nearly beyond belief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kissing this time does not stop, not for a long time. They kiss for long enough that Lan Wangji eventually forgets what it feels like to have never kissed Wei Ying, forgets about anything outside of the four walls of their room; long enough that they both get hard again, lazily rocking their hips against each other with less urgency than before. They can take their time now, this slow-cresting wave of arousal a different kind of pleasure from the one before, a different build.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things progress. They fuck again, just once more for the evening. Wei Wuxian is still wet enough, open enough from earlier that the slide inside him is easy, almost frictionless. They go sweeter and slower, Wei Wuxian in Lan Wangji\u2019s lap and rocking on top of him while he rests his forehead against Lan Wangji\u2019s collarbone. His thighs twine around Lan Wangji\u2019s waist, his crossed ankles knocking against the small of his back with each thrust. More like love-making, less like fucking. Fitting, for a reclaimed wedding night. In some ways, it\u2019s deeper in this position than before, and Lan Wangji takes his time in driving Wei Wuxian to the edge, kissing his husband\u2019s face everywhere he can reach. This time, Wei Wuxian does cry, though it doesn\u2019t seem like he means to, too overstimulated to stop; silent tears trail down his cheeks, his begging reduced to whispers. Lan Wangji barely gets a hand on Wei Wuxian\u2019s cock before he comes, whimpering softly and spurting hot over both of their fronts, messy spatters of it as he jerks and shudders through his pleasure. Wei Ying goes distant after that, silent and sleep-heavy even as Lan Wangji chases his own release, lifting and dropping Wei Wuxian by the hips when it becomes evident he\u2019s too tired to do any more work. He\u2019s already drowsing even when Lan Wangji releases inside him again, though he gives a contented little moan to demonstrate his alertness. It does not last. He\u2019s asleep by the time Lan Wangji pulls out of him, which leaves Lan Wangji no choice but to carry him in a tangle of limbs toward the tub. Lan Wangji expects the water to wake him, but Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t rouse even when Lan Wangji settles him in the bath between the vee of his legs; even when Lan Wangji begins to gently wipe him down with a washcloth. He manages to clear away the worst of the mess this way (and there is a lot of it), though Wei Wuxian will need to wash his hair in the morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Holding Wei Ying in his arms in the lukewarm water, bracketed safely between his thighs, Lan Wangji also drifts, his nose buried into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair. His natural scent is a balm, even unbathed. His person. His heart in another\u2019s body, in another\u2019s hands. Lan Wangji had never imagined...he had never known he could feel this way for anyone. The sheer breadth of it still terrifies him as much as in his early days. Perhaps moreso. There is so much more to lose, now. If something were to happen to him\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji exhales unevenly, tightening his arms around Wei Ying. Enough that Wei Wuxian nearly stirs, then drifts again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had not said it back earlier, when Wei Wuxian had. Not in words. He whispers it to him now, over and over, so that even in his dreaming, Wei Wuxian can be held by the encompassing surety of being loved; can be held by it, and kept.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji opens his eyes the next morning, he finds Wei Wuxian already awake, half-lidded and sleep-tousled and watching him. It\u2019s a little unusual to find Wei Wuxian awake before he is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stirs, wincing at the soreness he feels in strange muscles, parts of him tender that have never been before. After the bath, he had moved them both to the bed and had been too tired to bother with dressing either of them. He\u2019d simply sunk into the mattress, Wei Wuxian still asleep and naked in his arms, and had fallen directly into a dead sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, wriggling in closer to him. So close that their eyelashes brush, their noses softly bumping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, just as soft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian leans in to brush his lips over Lan Wangji\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d he whispers against his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are married,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first time didn\u2019t count,\u201d Wei Wuxian complains at a higher volume. \u201cThe whole thing was so horrible and awkward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, nipping along Wei Wuxian\u2019s jawline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips are swollen, a mottling of purple and red from the roughness of last night\u2019s bites and kisses. Gingerly, Lan Wangji runs a thumb over his lower lip, then the top one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he murmurs, outlining the full, sharp dip of Wei Wuxian\u2019s cupid\u2019s bow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt hurts, it hurts so bad, gege,\u201d Wei Wuxian says immediately. The suffering in his voice is belied by the mischievous glitter of his eyes, a fox\u2019s smile. \u201cLook what you did to your poor Wei Ying, mauling him like a rabid dog! No spouse has ever suffered the cruelty I suffer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, playing along. \u201cHow can I make amends?\u201d Gently, rainfall-soft, he presses a kiss to Wei Wuxian\u2019s tender mouth, as sweet and soft as he can make it. When he pulls back, Wei Wuxian is watching him with wide eyes, a flush high in his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s,\u201d Wei Wuxian says weakly, the game lost as his voice cracks. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji slides a hand down the length of Wei Wuxian\u2019s bare back, then squeezes once he finds his target.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian squeaks and wriggles under Lan Wangji\u2019s groping hand, his laughter breathless. \u201cYou seem to enjoy a certain part of me more than others, Hanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am undiscriminating,\u201d Lan Wangji says diplomatically, and uses his other hand to cup Wei Wuxian between his legs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a strangled sound in his throat and jerks his hips, his soft cock hardening a little at Lan Wangji\u2019s touch. \u201cFunny <em> and </em>a monster. It would seem my husband has unplumbed depths.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has been called many things in his lifetime by many people, but never funny. He had not realized he could be \u2014 or that he wanted to be, until Wei Ying. If Wei Wuxian were the only person on earth to think of him that way, it would be more than alright, he thinks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, wriggling into his side so that he\u2019s curled up like a pillbug. \u201cYou should know that I spent this morning thinking of a list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA list,\u201d Lan Wangji echoes, circling his thumb over one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s bare shoulder blades. Casual intimacy still feels foreign and exhilarating, like crashing into cold water for the first time, but it\u2019s also...strangely natural, in a way he never could have imagined. He always wants to be touching Wei Ying, now that he can.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf things that I want to do with you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, very solemnly. \u201cI mean, like, sex things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d Lan Wangji replies. He keeps his tone equally serious, but he can\u2019t quite keep the humor from his tone, or the anticipatory heat from curling low in his gut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. The list is rather extensive,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, as though to warn him. \u201cWhich I guess you should have expected, given you married someone so shameless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hums and wisely stays quiet. He has a sneaking suspicion his list is twice the length of Wei Ying\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you wanna go through it together?\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, low in his throat. His lips brush against the side of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji answers, meaning it. He\u2019s curious as to how many of their fantasies align.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, first off,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, in a very scholarly voice. \u201cI\u2019d like to eat you out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t help his reaction; the hand that had been caressing Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin tightens, a little convulsive, a small noise ripped from him. Wei Wuxian huffs a low laugh, nearing smug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, so Hanguang-jun concedes to that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji responds in his most neutral tone of voice. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t need any more leverage over him when it comes to this particular subject, and he has the feeling if he lets on, the teasing will be endless, and Lan Wangji will be the first Lan cultivator in history to qi-deviate from sexual frustration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you can do it to me,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues in a reasonable tone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji hums his approval. He thinks he will be good at that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, what about...what if we were to reverse what we just did?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. Curious, edging on cautious. \u201cI mean, with me...inside you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji releases a slow breath through his nose, closing his eyes against the suddenness of the image. It wouldn\u2019t be his first instinct, but he won\u2019t refuse anything involving Wei Wuxian\u2019s cock. \u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, that tone, er-gege! So, yes to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s response had been only incrementally different from any of his other ones, and he feels a strange tide of emotion wash through him as Wei Wuxian continues rambling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 I know some people are into using objects and all of that, but I don\u2019t really see the point. Why should I use some cold glass object when I have the real thing?\u201d Wei Wuxian is in the middle of saying. \u201cSo unless you want to try that, Lan Zhan, I\u2019m okay with just your dick for now. Although if you ever wanted to get Bichen involved, it\u2019s not like I\u2019d say no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, Lan Wangji\u2019s mind blanks completely at this suggestion. Then he says, in a valiant attempt at sternness, \u201cThere's a spirit attached to that sword.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cYou think it would oppose?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of respect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Bichen can respect my asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei <em> Ying</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, not sounding the least bit sorry. \u201cWhere was I? Oh, how would you feel about, mmmm...doing it outside, where someone could find us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates. While the image is viscerally appealing, his ingrained sense of propriety from a lifetime of sect disciplines is not so easily discarded. Perhaps...somewhere more secluded. It would be nice, to kiss Wei Wuxian in long grass or in lakes, under the sun and sky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll mark that down as a maybe, although I think I could seduce you into a hard yes,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, correctly reading Lan Wangji\u2019s expression. \u201cOh, here\u2019s a good one \u2014 tying me up? I\u2019d really like to try that. Or tying you up, that too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sounds his vehement agreement to that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re so compatible,\u201d Wei Wuxian teases him, nipping at his earlobe, which has grown warm. \u201cOkay, tying up, yes. How about if I were to...dress like a woman? You know, cosmetics, underthings, that kind of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji considers this. As has been exhaustively established, he has never experienced any desire toward women in general, nor for Wei Wuxian to be or act like one, but he would do anything to Wei Wuxian, in any possible form, and there\u2019s potential here, so Lan Wangji says, \u201cIf you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut do <em> you </em>want to?\u201d Wei Wuxian presses. He sounds a little anxious for the first time. He levers himself up on an elbow to study Lan Wangji\u2019s face, his loose hair slipping over his shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t just go along with whatever I say, Lan Zhan. I want to know what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want anything Wei Ying wants,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, with all the sincerity he can muster, and cranes up to press a kiss to Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips. \u201cThere is nothing I would say no to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian exhales, low and unsteady against his mouth. \u201cMark your words, er-gege.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will.\u201d Lan Wangji hesitates. This is the question he most wants an answer to. \u201cIs there anything Wei Ying would say no to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. A little too quickly. Lan Wangji waits. \u201cWell, I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk until you figure it out,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, and kisses his temple.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs, leaning into the touch, and gives it a moment of thought before he says, \u201cI think I wouldn\u2019t like \u2014 well, I know some couples like to...inflict pain on each other. I don\u2019t think I would...I mean, I like <em> some </em>pain, like what we did last night was fantastic, I like when you rough me up a little, but there\u2019s something about...\u201d He pauses, his teeth sinking into his lower lip as he thinks. Lan Wangji thumbs a dark strand of hair away from his forehead and waits for him to finish. \u201cThere\u2019s something about...the intentional infliction part that I don\u2019t like. You know, hitting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods. He can understand why, for someone like Wei Ying, the intrusion of inflicted pain into a space reserved for love and intimacy would be a source of discomfort.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would not lay a hand on you in a way that wasn\u2019t wanted,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him, which he of course hopes goes without saying, but there\u2019s a shadowed furrow forming between Wei Wuxian\u2019s brows, like he\u2019s making himself anxious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s expression smoothes out as his mouth curves up into a smirk. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019d like you to lay your hands all over me. Just...no hitting, I guess. Or blood. But anything else, you can do to me. You can do whatever you want to me and I\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji hums, and kisses the juncture where Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck meets his shoulder. He can\u2019t seem to stop kissing Wei Ying, now that he\u2019s allowed to. \u201cWe have our work cut out for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian says breathlessly. \u201cWe\u2019d better get started quickly if we want to \u2014 <em> ah, </em>ensure our research is conclusive \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As it happens, neither of them, after this, speak in full sentences for some time.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They only leave the following day once the innkeeper bangs on their door and tells them they\u2019ve received an excessive noise complaint. Lan Wangji\u2019s face is too thin to tolerate this, but Wei Wuxian laughs himself nearly sick as they quickly pack their things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, are you going to go next door and take responsibility?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks as they leave the room. His voice is almost entirely gone, so Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t feel the need to remind him whose fault this is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and makes a fast bid toward the exit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, husband, slow down,\u201d Wei Wuxian moans, lagging behind. \u201cI can barely walk, aiyo, and I keep leaking everywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji scolds on reflex, and he glances around to see if they\u2019ve been overheard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs and strolls into his space, squeezing Lan Wangji\u2019s hand in his.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, don\u2019t you like it?\u201d he murmurs close to his ear, which is growing warmer by the second. \u201cWhen I talk about the mess you\u2019ve made of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji thinks it\u2019s quite possible he won\u2019t survive another week as a fully married man.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you really do,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, sounding surprised at whatever he sees on Lan Wangji\u2019s face. Surprised and delighted. \u201cAnd to think so many find you principled and pure, Hanguang-jun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had begged repeatedly for mercy over the past day or so, and Lan Wangji had smugly not granted it. He surmises this is a deserved penance for such treatment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lan Wangji says, moving toward the stairs again. If Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t stop running his mouth, he\u2019s going to land them both in a situation they\u2019ll regret. Lan Wangji has long stifled his own desires, where Wei Ying is concerned, and is well-trained in the practice. But that had been when it was hypothetical. Knowing Wei Wuxian\u2019s body as thoroughly as he does now \u2014 and being forced to do anything outside of it \u2014 feels like its own unique form of punishment, something he is entirely unequipped to refuse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, Wei Wuxian mercifully leaves him alone, sobering up once they leave the inn and begin the tracking process again. They had selfishly squandered precious time over the past couple of days attending to their own marital needs, and it increases the sense of urgency in them both as they spend the afternoon throughout town, questioning locals and following rumors. There have been no more attacks, fortunately enough, but sightings in the woods that surround the town, creeping up into the mountains.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tracking the second jueyuan is almost easier than the first. The loss of its partner has clearly weakened the creature, making its trail sloppier and slower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Killing it, when they do catch up to it, is somewhat anticlimactic, though Lan Wangji keeps Wei Wuxian close behind him as he fights, part of his peripheral attention trained always on his husband. Wei Wuxian seems content to let Lan Wangji do most of the work, spectating and calling out encouragement whenever Lan Wangji\u2019s blade lands an especially good strike.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a close call, toward the end, that gets his blood humming hot with adrenaline: The yao springs at them from one of the trees behind, nearly clipping Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder with its nails, but he and Wei Wuxian are quicker, moving in tandem. Lan Wangji has always relished fighting alongside Wei Ying, from that very first night on the rooftop. They move as one unit, a match for the other. Wei Wuxian lands a blow with Suibian which cripples the jueyuan, spraying his robe with blood as the creature screams and buckles to the ground. Lan Wangji dispatches it with a quick slice, and then, at last, there\u2019s only silence aside from their heavy breathing, the sounds of the forest edging back in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They had gone to such trouble for this, Lan Wangji thinks, staring down at the jueyuan\u2019s lifeless, hairy body. Wei Ying had been injured, nearly fatally, for this. Their honeymoon, if it could be called that, had been interrupted for this. There is at least some satisfaction in seeing it done.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says in a low, peculiar voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns to check him over, to ensure he\u2019s alright, and finds Wei Wuxian already in his space, reeling him into a kiss. It\u2019s wet and dirty, Wei Wuxian\u2019s tongue sliding between his teeth, one of his hands knotted in the front of Lan Wangji\u2019s robe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, that was so hot,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes when they part, gasping for air. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just the adrenaline, but I\u2019m so, so hard right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes a rough sound against his mouth, shoving Wei Wuxian backward until his back crashes against the nearest tree trunk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTh-this is just \u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian pants, speaking around kisses as he scrabbles at Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders, \u201c \u2014 celebrating our victory, right? Yeah, we can \u2014 we can go back to an inn, and, and \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They do not make it to an inn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is still a monster corpse somewhere in proximity to them, but neither of them is concerned with such trivial things. Lan Wangji has Wei Wuxian\u2019s leg hiked up around his hip, grinding his hips forward against where Wei Wuxian is pinned to the tree. Wei Wuxian tolerates this treatment with moans and whines for a few minutes before he forcibly flips them, pushing Lan Wangji back against the bark.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang-jun is so brave and strong when he fights,\u201d Wei Wuxian purrs, the words ghosting against Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth. Lan Wangji affects nonchalance, unwilling to cede face to such blatant flirting, but he can feel how quick his pulse is, just from Wei Wuxian\u2019s proximity, from what his tone already promises. What Wei Ying can do to him, with so little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands slide down his sides to Lan Wangji\u2019s hips, sashaying closer into his space so that their chests are pressed together. \u201cI think my ever-so-good and upstanding husband deserves a reward, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that, he slides to his knees, tilting his face up toward Lan Wangji. There is a drying stripe of monster blood across his cheek. He looks like some beautiful, feral thing that had come from the heart of the woods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, but it could not be a protest even if he tried. He cannot pretend to want Wei Wuxian any less than he does, no matter how shameless it makes him appear. He tilts his head back against the tree and tries to breathe evenly, the metal prongs of his guan digging into his scalp as Wei Wuxian deftly works at his robes, peeling away layer after layer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHold them here, sweetheart,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his tone dripping with affection; at odds with the hungry look in his eyes, the way he keeps licking his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does as he\u2019s told, holding the hems of his robes bunched to free up access to his trousers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlready excited, hm?\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a laugh in his voice, like they weren\u2019t just rutting against each other on a tree. Then the wet heat of his mouth closes around Lan Wangji\u2019s cock through the silk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes a rough, wild sound, trying not to punch his hips forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho knew fighting monsters could get one so hot and bothered?\u201d Wei Wuxian continues when he pulls back, his eyes glittering with devious intent in the moonlight. He runs one lazy knuckle up the hard length of him. \u201cUnless this has something to do with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji grits out. He\u2019s too on edge for teasing, which he thinks Wei Wuxian may be well apprised of.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my name,\u201d Wei Wuxian says as he peels Lan Wangji\u2019s pants down his thighs, exposing his cock to the cool night air. \u201cAh, Lan Zhan. Look at you. You\u2019re already so hard and wet for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour fault,\u201d Lan Wangji says through clenched teeth, and Wei Wuxian laughs again and leans forward, lays a kittenish lick against the very tip. Lan Wangji\u2019s hips buck again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen this one will take responsibility,\u201d Wei Wuxian responds, very solemnly, and then he\u2019s sucking Lan Wangji\u2019s cock for real, leaning in to swirl his tongue around the head. It\u2019s a little clumsy, clearly inexperienced in spite of Wei Wuxian\u2019s confidence, and he chokes with a gagging <em> hck </em>sound when Lan Wangji\u2019s hips snap forward again. Lan Wangji\u2019s size is not inconsiderable, so Wei Wuxian can only take about half of his cock before it hits the back of his throat. Even half is enough for a maddening drag of pleasure; enough for Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes to tear up and spill over as his jaw works diligently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji should stop him. He should. There are no others around, but they are outdoors. It is public enough. They should stop this, retreat to privacy. <em> We shouldn\u2019t, we shouldn\u2019t. </em> The thought recurs to him, over and over, as he watches himself fuck Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth as though outside of his body. It has zero bearing. Wei Wuxian is pushing himself too hard, trying to take Lan Wangji as deep as he can without fully choking, but he can still only swallow about three-fourths even at his deepest, before his throat starts convulsing and fluttering around him as he fights his own gag reflex.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mouth is too small to take me,\u201d Lan Wangji says hoarsely. Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes roll back at this, his lashes fluttering as he moans, and he presses the heel of his hand against his own lap. <em>He\u2019s getting off to this,</em> Lan Wangji realizes, judging by the stuttering jerks of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips as he tries to grind against his own hand. He keeps making these humming, dirty moaning sounds around Lan Wangji\u2019s cock like he\u2019s enjoying a sweet dessert. It\u2019s completely obscene. The vibration is finally enough to push Lan Wangji to the edge, his gasps deafening in the night quiet of the woods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to \u2014\u201d he tries to warn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pulls off long enough to say, dark and directive, \u201cHold me still.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sinks his fingers into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair with his free hand, anchors his head firmly in place as he fucks his mouth again, even as Wei Wuxian wriggles and chokes and gags, more tears tracking down his face. Lan Wangji does not let up when he comes; he pushes Wei Wuxian\u2019s face forward toward his groin, a helpless groan escaping him as Wei Wuxian tries to swallow everything with wet, heaving gulps for breath, gagging around what he can\u2019t. What he can\u2019t swallow spills from his mouth, dribbling down his chin. Lan Wangji holds his face there in an unrelenting grip, coming down his throat until he\u2019s empty, until Wei Wuxian quits struggling against him and goes limp, his eyes glazed and distant, swallowing slackly around the last of the pulses even as Lan Wangji\u2019s cock softens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji slides down to his knees the moment he\u2019s finished, a little lightheaded. Wei Wuxian sways forward into his arms, burying his face into Lan Wangji\u2019s chest as he struggles to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToo much?\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, rubbing his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shakes his head, still heaving for air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d Lan Wangji persists, and Wei Wuxian shakes his head again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI swallowed most of it,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles into Lan Wangji\u2019s robes, sounding petulant. \u201cI\u2019ll get it right next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji finds the underside of Wei Wuxian\u2019s chin with his hand, tips his face out of hiding so he can kiss him, long and exhausted. Wei Wuxian hums into it, nearly a sigh. His mouth tastes different from before, brackish and ripe. The orgasm has, strangely enough, cleared Lan Wangji\u2019s head, settled him back in his body after the spiky adrenaline of the fight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, a little nonsensically as he pecks a kiss to Lan Wangji\u2019s chin. \u201cIt felt good, huh, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives one nod, afraid to speak. A little beyond words, still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhaaan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines at his silence. \u201cGive me something, will you? Performance notes? Glowing compliments? <em> Anything</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji leans in, close enough that Wei Wuxian tilts his head forward expectantly to chase a kiss. Lan Wangji keeps it from him, just out of reach, even as Wei Wuxian huffs in disbelief once he realizes he\u2019s been denied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, fully on the verge of a tantrum. \u201cH-how can you \u2014 !! After I just \u2014 you\u2019re so \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStand up,\u201d Lan Wangji instructs softly. \u201cBack toward me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grumbles but does as he\u2019s told, muttering heartfelt complaints as he does the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never in my life been treated like this! So cruelly ignored,\u201d he\u2019s carrying on to himself under his breath, \u201cand neglected by my heart\u2019s keeper, by my <em> wedded husband </em> who has never loved me a day in his life, who told me he loved me but <em> lied </em>to me. Is it my body? Am I too old and decrepit to be desired? I can\u2019t bear this treatment, it\u2019s really too \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji finds himself fending off a smile, though he keeps his tone cool and detached as he says, \u201cWrists crossed, on the tree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gives a beleaguered sigh but complies, pushing his hips out so they tilt up a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without another word, Lan Wangji begins to ruck up the layers of Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes, tucking the hems into his belt to keep them out of the way. Just his trousers remain when he\u2019s finished, fluttering in the gentle breeze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cL-Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, pushing off the tree to twist and look down at him. \u201cWh \u2014 what are you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHands on the tree,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, sterner than before. Enough so that Wei Wuxian quickly obeys. \u201cDo not move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs again and repositions his stance so that his feet are wider apart, bouncing from his heels to his toes. \u201cLan Zhan, it\u2019s cold like this, and my back hurts, and I \u2014 <em> hey</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had lost patience halfway through Wei Wuxian\u2019s complaint, yanking his trousers down so that they pool around his ankles. The motion leaves Wei Wuxian completely exposed, the perfect, round curve of his ass perky enough to bite.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes, much more unsteady than before. \u201cWhat if someone sees?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The chances that they\u2019ll be found, at this hour and in this part of the woods, are incredibly low, but Lan Wangji gets the sense that it excites Wei Wuxian to say so. He hums, noncommittal for effect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian teases, \u201care you doing this just to stare at me?\u201d He arches his back into a deeper bend, wiggling his hips a little so that his cheeks bounce. \u201cBecause if you just want to look, we can \u2014 <em> ah</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without any further warning, Lan Wangji spreads him open with his thumbs, exposing the tight furl of his hole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Wei Wuxian says in a strange voice, oddly panicked-sounding as he tries futilely to squirm away. \u201cLan Zhan, you \u2014 you <em> can\u2019t, </em>not that \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Undeterred, Lan Wangji leans forward and licks a hot stripe over his hole, firm and swift. Wei Wuxian\u2019s knees nearly buckle, the volume of his cry scattering a couple of dormant birds from a nearby tree.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cH-Hanguang-jun,\u201d Wei Wuxian says weakly, panting. \u201cI-isn\u2019t that too dirty? What if someone were to, <em> nnnn</em>, fuck \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is quite content where he is, on his knees in the dirt and diligently returning the favor Wei Wuxian had performed for him. The sounds of it are a little lewd for his sensibility, shockingly loud, and he can feel the heat of shamelessness stinging in his ears, in his cheeks, but none of it is enough for him to stop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no no,\u201d Wei Wuxian moans, even as he pushes himself deeper onto Lan Wangji\u2019s tongue. \u201cL-Lan Zhan, what would they s-say if they saw, I, oh \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is shaking with the effort of holding himself in position, trying not to cave to pleasure as Lan Wangji licks him open, prodding deeper into the buried heat of him. He keeps trying to push back, to push down as he keeps his wrists in place as he\u2019s been told, making a loud enough racket that surely half the town can hear them from li away. Lan Wangji\u2019s jaw is sore within seconds, his facial muscles unused to the strain, but he finds himself too greedy to stop. He has lived his entire life ordered by discipline. By rules he values, but restriction nonetheless. He feels wild at the prospect of loving Wei Ying without them. Everything is allowed, now. Even this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has a hand on himself, pushing into his own grip as he rocks back onto Lan Wangji's mouth, moaning unintelligible pleas. It takes only a minute of this for Wei Wuxian to come with a shuddering, keening wail, violently enough that it nearly puts a cramp in Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. Lan Wangji firmly holds him still so he doesn\u2019t buck too much, keeping him spread open as he licks him through it, as Wei Wuxian begs for more and for less.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When it\u2019s clear he\u2019s finished, Lan Wangji turns his head to bite one of his cheeks, hard enough that Wei Wuxian yelps. He pinches and squeezes until the skin reddens, nearly bruises, until Wei Wuxian whines at him, his voice shaking with nearly believable pitifulness. \u201cWh-why are you bullying me like this? Lan Zhan, so mean \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still twitching from the orgasm, his legs visibly trembling. When Lan Wangji pulls him down onto his lap, he can feel that the front of Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes are wet. Wei Wuxian sighs, relieved-sounding, and settles his back to Lan Wangji\u2019s front, tipping his head back onto his shoulder. For a moment, they catch their breath together, the night sounds of the forest trickling back into awareness, the cool breeze prickling at their bare skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles a moment later. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you put your mouth there. Hanguang-jun, just who did I marry? What beast has replaced my husband, who nearly de-limbed me for a book of pornography not so long ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was afraid then,\u201d Lan Wangji confesses, his voice soft. \u201cOf what I wanted. Of who I wanted, and how much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI really can\u2019t believe that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, rolling his head so his forehead presses against Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cLan Zhan, did you always have such a big crush on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does Wei Ying ask what he already knows,\u201d Lan Wangji returns, too gentle to be a true retort.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, wriggling deeper into Lan Wangji\u2019s lap. \u201cI always really thought you hated me! Even when we got married!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSay more, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, then answers softly, \u201cOur wedding night may look different in hindsight, if you can imagine what it is to marry the one you have feelings for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian glances up at him. His gaze is soft, moon-touched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day, they at last begin their travels back to Gusu. It is the happiest Lan Wangji can ever recall being in his life, a blue day and the promise of home and the even greater promise of Wei Ying by his side. Wei Wuxian has never been shy with his touches, but he touches Lan Wangji endlessly now, gripping his hand or tugging at the ends of his ribbon. Soon, Wei Ying will have a forehead ribbon of his own, however he wishes to wear it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says when they land from flying halfway through the day to eat. \u201cYou\u2019re so different from before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tilts his head at him in a silent request for elaboration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore all of this, you were so tense and angry about everything,\u201d Wei Wuxian clarifies. \u201cYou seem so...you\u2019re so relaxed now.\u201d He makes a show of visibly sizing Lan Wangji up, tapping a finger to his chin. \u201cHanguang-jun, the change is quite remarkable!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch is to be expected,\u201d Lan Wangji returns quietly, \u201cwhen one falls in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian widens his eyes at him and then, to Lan Wangji\u2019s private delight, turns the same shade as a peony.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already knew,\u201d Lan Wangji points out, to Wei Wuxian\u2019s flustered silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Wei Wuxian says faintly. \u201cIt\u2019s different when you keep <em> saying it. </em>Lan Zhan, won\u2019t you take mercy on your hapless husband?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, serene.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a face at him, but hugs his arm tighter, clinging to his side as they browse the market for a midday meal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cannot look away from him, even once, for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their remaining homegoing journey is peaceful and quick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had wondered, when he had seen Wei Wuxian in Lotus Pier, if he could feel at ease in the Cloud Recesses the same way, and he is surprised by the peacefulness bedding down within him as the mountains thicken around them; as the altitude thins and the landscape finally begins to resemble his home. Wei Wuxian watches him out of the corner of his eye as though he may be observing something similar, and whenever Lan Wangji catches him staring, Wei Wuxian simply smiles in return, small and private.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scouts must alert Lan Wangji\u2019s family of their return, because when they approach the front gate, they\u2019re greeted by his shufu, xiongzhang, and behind them a few paces, two elders. Upon closer inspection, Lan Wangji recognizes Lan Qingsheng and Lan Boqin, and neither look pleased to see them. At the sight of them, Wei Wuxian quietly distances himself from Lan Wangji, and Lan Wangji resists the urge to reel him back in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Xichen says warmly as they near. \u201cWei-gongzi. It\u2019s good to see you have returned safely, albeit a little later than we anticipated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji apologizes for the delay,\u201d Lan Wangji says, without much compunction. \u201cDid xiongzhang receive my letter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen inclines his head. \u201cI did. Your decision to stay for the night hunt was understandable, of course, and the correct course of action.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two elders begin to mutter at this, scowling at Wei Wuxian with distrust.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre the yaoguai taken care of?\u201d Lan Qiren says crisply, speaking over them. He has not looked at Wei Wuxian since the two of them approached.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, shufu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. Good. I trust there were no complications or further delays.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unbidden, Lan Wangji thinks of what he\u2019d done to Wei Wuxian in the forest directly after that last fight, opening him up on his tongue while Wei Wuxian had fallen to pieces above him, and he narrowly avoids blushing in front of his family. That could be considered a delay, indeed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, shufu,\u201d he says demurely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji\u2019s input was missed at the recent conference,\u201d Lan Qingsheng interjects as he takes a few steps forward, his eyes narrowed on Wei Wuxian.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUrgent matters called for us to stay and assist,\u201d Lan Wangji replies. \u201cWangji will attend the next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Lan Boqin says, joining at Lan Qiren and Lan Qingsheng\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThe behavior is unlike you, Wangji.\u201d His dark gaze shifts to Wei Wuxian and hardens with scorn. \u201cAs though someone persuaded you against returning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren turns sharply to face the other elder. \u201cTowns have been spared a yaoguai\u2019s attacks due to Wangji\u2019s choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is surprised by the defense, but he takes care not to show it. Lan Xichen looks startled also, watching the three elders with a slight crease between his brows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my fault, Lan-qianbei,\u201d Wei Wuxian speaks up, and before Lan Wangji can stop him, he takes a step in front of Lan Wangji and bows deeply to the three elders. \u201cI convinced Lan Zhan that it would be best to stay and help. He insisted on returning for the conference.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is indeed unsurprising,\u201d Lan Qingsheng says coldly, still glaring at Wei Wuxian. A protective urge flares up in Lan Wangji with a bright heat. He opens his mouth to defend Wei Wuxian\u2019s choice, but his xiongzhang speaks before he can.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless of choices made, what is past is past,\u201d Lan Xichen says in peaceable tones. \u201cAs my shufu said, many lives have been spared this way, and there will be many other conferences in which we can collaborate with Wangji. Let us look toward the future now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Lan Boqin says. \u201cSo long as no other precepts are broken, due to the influence of\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji steps forward so he\u2019s pressed against Wei Wuxian\u2019s back, and then slides a hand onto his shoulder. The action sends a visible ripple of reaction through the three seniors, as brazen as it is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich rule has been breached?\u201d Lan Wangji says coolly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only silence answers him for a moment. Lan Qiren has a hawk\u2019s gaze focused on Lan Wangji\u2019s hand still resting on Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder, his mouth puckered as though he\u2019s tasted something sour, but he says nothing to reproach him outright.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPrioritize one\u2019s sect,\u201d Lan Qingsheng says at last, in icy tones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPut the needs of one\u2019s spouse above all others,\u201d Lan Wangji recites, his hand tightening on Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His words cast a pall over the other two elders, their faces drawing and tightening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBe diligent in one\u2019s sect responsibilities,\u201d Lan Boqin says, his teeth clenched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cProtect the weak and vulnerable,\u201d Lan Wangji answers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are none in the Cloud Recesses who know the precepts as readily as Lan Wangji does. Not even his seniors. He can sense his shufu watching him, a little grimly, but with a detectable glint of something else. He would not go so far as to call it pride, but. Maybe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not associate with evil,\u201d Lan Qingsheng snaps, a vein in his forehead pulsing. He is, of course, referring to Wei Ying\u2019s alternative cultivation work. Ever so slightly, Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder tenses under Lan Wangji\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s voice, when it comes again, is much quieter. \u201cLove all beings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was the precept he had struggled with the most as a child. He had not understood, for a very long time, how could one truly love everyone they encountered. Especially one such as him, who tolerated so few. It didn\u2019t seem realistic or fair, nor was it as practically defined as the other disciplines.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he has changed, after all. Loving Wei Ying has allowed him, slowly but surely, to find love in all things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQingsheng-qianbei, Boqin-qianbei,\u201d Lan Xichen interrupts, perhaps because both elders look as though they\u2019re about to spit. \u201cWangji and Wei-gongzi have had a long journey and are no doubt exhausted. If you wish to discuss this with them further, it can be done at a later time, surely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The elders grumble but concede, their lines of argument spent. Lan Wangji glances at his xiongzhang. He keeps his expression neutral, but he knows Lan Xichen will interpret the <em> thank you </em>for what it is. Lan Xichen\u2019s eyes meet his, and his mouth quirks at the corner.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve returned safely, Wangji,\u201d Lan Xichen says, then transfers a pleasant look to Wei Wuxian. \u201cAnd Wei-gongzi. It is rare to see Wangji in such high spirits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this, Lan Qiren turns to leave, following after the other two elders where they\u2019ve begun to disperse. Then he pauses in his steps, and turns halfway back to Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI trust I will see Wangji for supper this evening,\u201d he says. His throat works for a moment, his beard bobbing, before he adds, grudgingly, \u201cAnd Wei-gongzi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tension uncoils in Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, a tightness he hadn\u2019t realized was so closely wound. He nods, a new lightness rising in him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cYes, shufu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren gives a quiet <em> hmph </em>and moves away again, following after where Lan Qingsheng and Lan Boqin are already several paces ahead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you tonight, Lan-xiansheng!\u201d Wei Wuxian shouts with a vigorous wave to Lan Qiren\u2019s back, who makes no indication he\u2019s heard Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian winces and says, quieter to Lan Wangji, \u201cToo much, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With only his brother as a witness, Lan Wangji feels comfortable taking Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist, guiding them past Lan Xichen into the Cloud Recesses and heading toward the direction of the jingshi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says several minutes later, once they near the front of the library. He tugs on Lan Wangji\u2019s hand to direct him, pulling him through the open door. They are alone here for now, the depths of the library as silent and austere as they always are. Its scent has always been soothing to Lan Wangji, ink and parchment and the lingering remnants of incense, an echo of the entire days he\u2019d passed here as a child researching or reading. In more recent years, the smell has reminded him of Wei Ying and the summertime, after so many of those afternoons spent here together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like a dream from a younger self, the present Wei Wuxian backs up against one of the walls, pulling Lan Wangji closer to him as he goes and slatting their fingers together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Wei Wuxian begins. \u201cI know that I only make your life here more difficult, and I know that I...I\u2019m not really\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji interrupts, a low murmur. His thumb catches on the soft curve of Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek, a slow stroke. Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes flutter half-shut, his throat hitching around a swallow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI already made the Jiangs\u2019 lives hard enough in Lotus Pier,\u201d he says, with a wry curve of his mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to war on my behalf with your elders. My ego can handle their aspersions, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cThat may be so. But I will not tolerate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian starts again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are three I hold most dear,\u201d Lan Wangji interrupts, swift in his conviction. \u201cMy sect. My family. You. No two are incompatible with the other. This, I know very well to be true. It\u2019s of no consequence what others may believe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at him for a long time, his mouth parted. Then he leans in, pushing up slightly onto his toes, to kiss Lan Wangji, careful and deep. Wei Wuxian\u2019s kisses are usually fleeting, impatient bites, messy and sloppy and eager. But this is different, heated and slow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian fits a palm to Lan Wangji\u2019s cheek when he pulls away. His eyes are soft, wondering. \u201cYou really\u2026love me, don\u2019t you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d So much. Lan Wangji\u2019s heart is still racing from kissing him. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then licks his lips. \u201cLan Zhan, can you show me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is an exercise in willpower not to do so right there on the library floor, as he\u2019s imagined so many times before, but Lan Wangji does possess some decency still, so he only takes Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and pulls him, very quickly and too roughly, in the direction of the jingshi. Wei Wuxian laughs a little breathlessly in his wake, nearly jogging to keep up, but he doesn\u2019t let go of Lan Wangji\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment they\u2019re through the jingshi\u2019s door, after it slides shut behind them, Lan Wangji crowds Wei Wuxian against the nearest flat surface, kissing and biting whatever skin he can reach. He already has one hand squeezing along Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist, the other tangled in his hair. Wei Wuxian gives another winded laugh, then gives over to half-panted <em> ah</em>s and whimpers, squirming under Lan Wangji\u2019s touches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says a moment later, when he\u2019s apparently recovered his ability to speak. \u201cWe never \u2014 <em> ah, </em>fuck, ah \u2014 broke in our marital bed together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, making quick work of Wei Wuxian\u2019s belt. \u201cNegligent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat should we do about that?\u201d Wei Wuxian wonders as he takes Lan Wangji\u2019s outer robe in his hands, peeling it off of his shoulders with a push. Lan Wangji can\u2019t answer because Wei Wuxian is kissing him again, both hands steeled to either side of his face so he can\u2019t pull away. Lan Wangji drags him by the front of his robes, walking them both back until they find the bed, until Wei Wuxian is tumbling down on top of him with an airless, high-pitched laugh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji flips them both with ease, Wei Wuxian\u2019s back crashing into the mattress as he pants up at Lan Wangji, his eyes and his breath dazed. Lan Wangji\u2019s hand moves to the back of Wei Wuxian\u2019s head, and his fingers work to untie the red ribbon, so the knot of his ponytail won\u2019t dig into his skull while he\u2019s pressed against the bed. Wei Wuxian is still half-dressed, but with the belt missing, his front layers are split open, a deep plunge of bare skin to his navel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. His voice is low but gentle. \u201cThe way you look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji rewards this by sucking a love-bite into Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck, hard enough that blood rises to the skin and Wei Wuxian\u2019s fingers scrabble ineffectively at his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian protests. \u201cWe have dinner with your family later, I can\u2019t show up looking <em> ravaged \u2014 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn your back or on your front?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, sliding a hand inside Wei Wuxian\u2019s trousers to cup his erection, which rapidly hardens from half-mast to full in his grip.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot believe I\u2019m being treated like this,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines, making a dramatic show of trying to get away from Lan Wangji\u2019s probing hand. \u201cOn my back. Lan Zhan, I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d married such a brute, my husband is an insatiable beast who takes what he wants from his poor, helpless \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Lan Wangji says; not out of a true desire for Wei Wuxian to stop talking, which he is helplessly fond of, so much as to watch Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw snap shut at the roughness of the command, his cheeks reddening and his eyes going bright. \u201cShow me how much you want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian does. It is good sex. Possibly their best yet, if only because each time is impossibly better than the last, the more they know each other\u2019s bodies, what riles the other up or pushes to an edge. Afterward, they lie together silent and winded and panting up at the ceiling in shared disbelief as sweat cools on their skin. Wei Wuxian is complaining softly about soreness, which Lan Wangji knows by now to be performance because if Wei Ying were truly in pain, he would be the last to voice it. Lan Wangji slings an arm over Wei Wuxian, pulling him in closer to rest as the afternoon sun slowly bakes from white to gold through the windows, leaving brassy prints on their skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you happy in the jingshi?\u201d Lan Wangji finally asks, once the bone-deep exhaustion has lifted and resettled into simple contentment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shifts next to him, squirming from half-awake to fully alert. \u201cIt\u2019s different from what I\u2019m used to. It\u2019s...quiet. Very clean. Mmm, orderly. But Lan Zhan, I\u2019ll like anywhere that you are. Anywhere that I can keep pestering you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silence is indeed in the name. Lan Wangji had never considered anything but a quiet, solitary lifestyle for himself, before Wei Ying. He has realized, over the last couple of months, that the two may not be compatible, and it is obvious which his priority is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you want to live somewhere else?\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, tracing a bud of sunlight on Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder with his knuckle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian starts to fidget, clearly gearing up to deflect. \u201cLan Zhan, I know how important your sect is to you. Living here was a compromise I agreed to when I married you. I wouldn\u2019t want you to go anywhere that makes you unhappy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying\u2019s unhappiness is far more important to me,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, as if such an instruction were even possible. \u201cI\u2019m really fine, Lan Zhan! I\u2019m low-maintenance. You could really put me up anywhere and I\u2019d be okay. As long as there\u2019s a roof over my head, my basic needs are met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is silent for another moment, waiting patiently for Wei Wuxian to relax again. He had gone slightly tense at the line of conversation, almost like he\u2019d been charging up to argue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I built a home for us somewhere in the mountains?\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cStill within the Cloud Recesses, but far enough away for privacy. For just the two of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hesitates, then says tentatively, \u201cYeah? You think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWhat would you like to see there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian thinks on the request for a moment, battering his lower lip with his teeth. His lashes are not as black as Lan Wangji had once thought \u2014 they\u2019re almost tawny in the afternoon sun. He\u2019s so beautiful that Lan Wangji feels his heart give a faint stutter, a shudder of disbelief. It doesn\u2019t seem possible, to have him like this. It sometimes feels as though he\u2019s still waking from a dream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says after another moment lost in thought, then blinks at Lan Wangji sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019ve never even thought it was a possibility to have a home of my own, so I\u2019m a little short on imagination.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly, pressing a kiss to his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian says after another moment. \u201cI know they\u2019re a lot of work, so definitely say no if you don\u2019t want to, but what about a lotus pond? Ahhh, it feels ridiculous to even ask, in a climate like this, but \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then narrows his eyes in thought again. \u201cHang on, that was the only idea I had. Oh, what about the rabbits? I <em> know </em> you still keep them around, Lan Zhan ah, I\u2019m in on the big secret now that you\u2019re much too soft to have gotten rid of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, an amused affirmative. \u201cI care for them on the back mountain. We can take the rabbits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian flashes a smile with a surprised, uncomplicated kind of joy. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAiyoo, my husband is making me do so much work,\u201d Wei Wuxian complains, \u201cafter what he just did to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about a garden?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, and Wei Wuxian lights up further.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, definitely,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201cthat way I can grow things and cook for you!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is vaguely familiar with the horrors of Wei Wuxian\u2019s cooking, but the thought is sweet, and Lan Wangji would eat anything Wei Wuxian made with his own hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian continues, \u201cI would prefer if there was\u2026.mm, I don\u2019t know, a field that I could work in during the days. I know that\u2019s impossible, living in the mountains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can keep going to the villages to help,\u201d Lan Wangji suggests, remembering Wei Wuxian\u2019s worn-in happiness that evening early in their marriage. \u201cI will go with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian brightens again, the corners of his mouth curving up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wriggles closer to Lan Wangji so that all of their bare skin can press against each other. \u201cI\u2019d really like that.\u201d He peers up at Lan Wangji doubtfully. \u201cLan Zhan, are you really going to build us a house?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji answers promptly. He does not say what he does not mean. \u201cAs soon as I can have it finished, we can move there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles again, then presses his forehead against Lan Wangji\u2019s chest. \u201cI like you so much.\u201d Before Lan Wangji can recover properly enough to answer, Wei Wuxian continues, \u201cWhen I was younger, I always thought I\u2019d probably love whoever I married \u2014 if I got the choice as to who I was marrying, that is. But I never thought about liking them this much. I didn\u2019t know I could like anyone this much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly. He can\u2019t articulate, suddenly, the correct words to voice how much he feels the same; that he\u2019d never imagined liking or loving anyone at all, before Wei Ying. Marriage had always been something cold and secular to him, purely obligatory. The best possible scenario he had envisioned for himself had been a partnership that was peaceful only for the fact that it was unchallenging, ideally one that permitted him his space. It hadn\u2019t been until he met Wei Ying that he had realized how quickly he could revoke solitude. It hadn\u2019t been until Wei Ying that he\u2019d understood love stories; that he, all at once, had understood everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian speaks up, his voice still muffled against Lan Wangji\u2019s skin. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns. \u201cFor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBack at the library just now, I asked you to show me how you love me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and looks up at Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji has never seen him quite like this; so strangely unguarded and free of teasing, the color in his eyes a liquid warmth. \u201cAnd you did. You\u2019ve loved me better than anyone else ever has, or \u2014 or ever could, I think. So: Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Lan Wangji can stop himself, he\u2019s speaking. \u201cI want to marry you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks, his eyes widening in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would marry you again every day, if I could,\u201d Lan Wangji says, nearly tripping the words out in his haste. \u201cBut I would like...a second wedding. A private one, in which we are both willing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A love wedding, he does not say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is nodding vigorously even before Lan Wangji has finished speaking, his eyes still round. \u201cYes, I \u2014 Lan Zhan, yes. Of course. Please. Marry me again, or marry me a hundred times, I don\u2019t care \u2014 just \u2014 yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and he does not smile, but it\u2019s a near thing. This, finally, feels like the beginning. \u201cWhere would you like to start?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
