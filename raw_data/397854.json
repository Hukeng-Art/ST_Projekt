  "text": "<p>\u201cTimmy,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s going to be in the well.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJasper,\u201d his dad says. \u201cHe looks like a Jasper.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTiny?\u201d Stiles suggests. \u201cJust while he\u2019s a puppy.\u201d </p>\n<p>His dad looks at the bundle of black and gold fur and bright eyes peering at him from the crook of Stiles\u2019 arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t give a dog a dog-name,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s undignified. He needs a people-name.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot while he\u2019s a puppy, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles argues. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t even small anymore,\u201d his dad fires back. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s tiny compared to <i>himself</i>,\u201d Stiles says, and his dad snorts, but doesn\u2019t disagree. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my <i>god</i>,\u201d Lydia says, when Stiles steps into the classroom on Monday morning. She\u2019s broken off her conversation with Mindy Jenkins mid-word, Stiles is pretty sure, and cranked around in her chair to stare at him. \u201cYou got a <i>dog</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, did you?\u201d Mindy asks. \u201cAre there pictures on facebook?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lydia ignores her. Stiles doesn\u2019t usually sit next to Lydia, but he takes the open seat next to her because she\u2019s staring at him like a crazy person and it\u2019s freaking him out and he\u2019s kind of afraid if he doesn\u2019t stay close she\u2019ll leapfrog all the students between them so she can pounce on him and shake him down for deets, and Stiles just does not want to deal with that first thing Monday morning. </p>\n<p>\u201cI got a dog,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it would be better than a cat. You know.\u201d He gives Lydia a meaningful look. \u201cI thought my friends might like it better, you know what I mean.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDo your stupid friends not like cats?\u201d Mindy asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lydia barks, and then freezes, completely unable to admit to possibly being Stiles\u2019 friend. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mindy asks obliviously. \u201cI like cats. They\u2019re gods, you know. In Egypt. And they would be here too, if people around here had any sense of self-preservation.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles and Lydia take a second to stare at her bland, smiling face, and then get back to their weirdly intense business. \u201cWhy did you get a dog?\u201d Lydia asks. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles thinks about how Lydia avoided acknowledging him as a friend, how Jackson has always hated him, thinks about how Scott hasn\u2019t had time for him since Derek became alpha and Allison\u2019s family grudgingly accepted his presence in her life. And he thinks about how Allison and Danny have never seemed to care about him one way or the other, and that stings, though it hardly matters. </p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like it,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Lydia says, eyes wild. \u201cI have to tell everyone.\u201d </p>\n<p>She bolts for the door, abandoning her friend, Stiles, her books and her <i>handbag</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Mindy asks, vaguely concerned. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like puppies,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like anything she can\u2019t browbeat.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Mindy says, and nods, convinced. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Lydia is waiting for him when the class gets out. Scott and Jackson are with her. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you all have crazy-eyes?\u201d Stiles asks, baffled. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou got a dog,\u201d Jackson says, hushed, though the insanity in his eyes is screaming out loud. </p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Stiles says, frowning. \u201cHis name\u2019s Tiny. He\u2019s not really tiny, but he\u2019s still a puppy, so\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell like dog,\u201d Scott says urgently. </p>\n<p>\u201c...I\u2014\u201c Stiles says. \u201c\u2014have a dog?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to take this into the bathroom,\u201d Lydia says harshly, and she\u2019s the one with perfect control, always is, but it\u2019s fraying around the edges enough that her voice actually <i>cracks</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Stiles asks, looking at the stream of students parting around their huddle and flowing onwards, no help to him at all. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d Lydia says, and the next thing he knows he\u2019s in the boy\u2019s bathroom and Jackson is trying to wedge the door shut. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014\u201c Stiles starts, but then Lydia is <i>rubbing</i> herself all over him, like some kind of\u2014animal, huh, okay. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201c Stiles squeaks, but Scott is encircling him from behind, chest pressed to Stiles\u2019 back, arms brushing anywhere they can reach, and, \u201cBoobs,\u201d Stiles says, because Lydia\u2019s are right there, in his <i>face</i> as she writhes all over his body, and she\u2019s too distracted to care. </p>\n<p>\u201cDerek can\u2019t know,\u201d Scott says, voice high and frantic. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s <i>going</i> to know,\u201d Lydia says, and she sounds like she\u2019s seriously flipping out. \u201cHow could he not know!\u201d </p>\n<p>And Stiles wonders about that, he does, but then Jackson succeeds in getting the door locked somehow and joins the group, and Stiles prefers not to remember anything that happened after that. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>That was a little weird, but Stiles wasn\u2019t actually expecting it to happen again the next day.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we doing this on the regular?\u201d he asks faintly, shoved into an abandoned classroom and gangcuddled against his will. Well, not exactly against his will, if you exclude Jackson, but definitely unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we take our clothes off?\u201d Jackson asks.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cDerek would smell it on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek smells <i>everything</i>,\u201d Scott despairs.</p>\n<p>Stiles is right there with him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The next day they all stand in a circle around him and glare, after they all take turns spooning and petting him or whatever. There may have been a little licking of his neck and face involved, but Stiles has no memory of that whatsoever, he swears to <i>God</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are worse than Tiny,\u201d he says, when the glares persist. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are so lucky Derek is out of town,\u201d Lydia mutters. \u201cHe would kill that dog. I kind of want to kill the dog and I don\u2019t even like you that much.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d she says, brightening. \u201cWe should kill the dog!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to touch Stilinski any more, even if I get to keep my clothes on.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d Stiles says, appalled. </p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI mean\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is <i>wrong</i> with you?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t know what your problem is, but you are coming over tonight and meeting Tiny.\u201d He can almost see their hackles go up. \u201cAnd nobody will do anything to him,\u201d Stiles says, aware that his voice is rocketing up the crazyscale but unable to do anything to stop it. \u201cNobody is even going to look at him wrong or I\u2019m telling Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Scott shrills. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI should just tell Derek right now,\u201d Stiles says, pulling his phone out. \u201cI should tell him how <i>insane</i> you all are and get him to come back early, and let me tell you, it is a <i>sad</i> day when Derek Hale is the voice of reason, it is a\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Lydia snatches the phone from his hand and throws it into the nearest toilet like she\u2019s going for the winning point at Homecoming. </p>\n<p>And okay, that was only a Galaxy, but, \u201cYou\u2019re buying me a 4S,\u201d Stiles says, and Lydia shrugs. </p>\n<p>\u201cWorth it,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They come over that night, eyes watchful and noses wrinkled as they draw closer to Tiny.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>hate</i> him,\u201d Lydia says, because he\u2019s cuter than she is.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too!\u201d Scott says, which, what?</p>\n<p>Excited, Tiny bounds towards them but stops short well out of reach. He\u2019s <i>clever</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s a clever boy?\u201d Stiles says fatuously, dropping to his knees so he can reward Tiny with many, many pets.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, we\u2019re better than he is,\u201d Lydia says, like that means something. \u201cWe\u2019ll win!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s the cleverest boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott narrows his eyes at Tiny, crouched between the pack and Stiles. \u201cUsurper,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Tiny growls at the assembled threat.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, he learned how to growl!\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe hardly even sounds like a teddybear anymore!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea why I care about any of this,\u201d Lydia says, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to <i>cut</i> somebody.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut not Tiny! Because Tiny is too cute! Don\u2019t you just adore him? You can\u2019t help it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI expected him to be smaller,\u201d Jackson says, sounding a little daunted but reaching out to touch.</p>\n<p>Tiny suffers through it, but then Jackson says, \u201cHey, Stilinski, you don\u2019t look anything like your dog. This little guy is way too good for you, even if he is\u2014\u201c and reaches out to tap Stiles on the arm, and Tiny almost snaps his fingers off.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Jackson yanks his hand back, curled into a fist.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou <i>dominated</i>, Tiny.\u201d He smacks Tiny\u2019s nose, though he doesn\u2019t really want to. \u201cThat\u2019s bad, though. Bad! Ah! No biting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can smell us on Stiles,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like it either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Scott says slowly. \u201cDoes he think you\u2019re the alpha? Stiles, he thinks you\u2019re the alpha!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe breeder told me about this,\u201d Stiles says proudly. \u201cThey\u2019re a loyal, intelligent breed who protect their pack, but they need a master.\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts himself off before he starts babytalking to Tiny about how much Stiles loves being his master and how Tiny is <i>such</i> a good pack to Stiles.</p>\n<p>He feels like they hear it anyway, and his face is flushed when he stands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you should go,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Tiny Dominator likes you very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tiny Dominator growls.</p>\n<p>\u201cI resent this and I will not let it stand,\u201d Lydia says. To <i>Tiny Dominator</i>.</p>\n<p>They leave.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The pack doesn\u2019t show up to grope him en masse the next day, and Stiles doesn\u2019t miss it, but he expects it all through school. When he sees Lydia in class she just throws him a narrow-eyed, evaluating look, and then the pack spends lunch standing in a corner of the cafeteria blatantly staring over at him while discussing him amongst themselves. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are our friends staring at us like freaks?\u201d Allison asks, when Scott keeps returning her enthusiastic waves but not making a move to join the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI think they\u2019ve just been spending too much time with Derek.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t hurt or anything, it\u2019s just another change. There\u2019ve been a lot of changes lately, and he\u2019s getting a little tired of it. </p>\n<p>When he gets home from school Tiny is stuck at the top of the stairs whining pitifully, so he spends some time trying to improvise a babygate to keep him down when he has to be alone in the house. Tiny tries to help by licking Stiles to distraction every time he gets within reach, but Stiles perseveres until a knock interrupts him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey Scott,\u201d Stiles says, swinging open the front door. </p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Derek says, peering past Stiles. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Weren\u2019t you supposed to be out of town for another\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cYour father is at work and I knew you were alone,\u201d Derek interrupts. Rude, and also kind of creepy. \u201cI just came by to\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you say \u2018came by\u2019 you mean you hopped on over from Arizona.\u201d </p>\n<p>After a minute, Derek says, \u201cYes,\u201d like it\u2019s a stupid question. He\u2019s still trying to see into the house past Stiles, but Stiles always closes Tiny in the kitchen when he\u2019s opening the front door, because Tiny is young and liable to get lost if let outside, and Stiles hasn\u2019t had time to get him chipped yet. </p>\n<p>Derek leans in close in his attempt to see over Stiles\u2019 shoulder, closer than he usually gets unless he\u2019s shoving Stiles against a car or a tree or his own bedroom wall preparatory to growling something threatening right in Stiles\u2019 ear, which never really has the intended effect, what with how Derek\u2019s voice sounds when he does it, plus, that hasn\u2019t even happened in like, a <i>month</i>. Stiles is deprived. </p>\n<p>Derek is making up for the oversight now, though, hand fisting in Stiles\u2019 shirt, face ducked into his body, nose touching his skin, and then his mouth is against Stiles\u2019 ear, saying, \u201cYou smell.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014\u201c Stiles says. \u201c\u2014What?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell,\u201d Derek repeats, and his voice is as low and rough and hot as always, and he isn\u2019t even threatening Stiles this time, but it\u2019s weird enough that Stiles hardly even cares. </p>\n<p>\u201cI smell?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell of\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek breaks off, an aggressive rumble building in his chest, and he\u2019s reaching for Stiles when Stiles shoves him away, sends him stumbling down a step. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf the next word out of your mouth is \u2018puppy\u2019 we\u2019re going to have a problem,\u201d Stiles says. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be,\u201d Derek says, making it sound like an insult. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says slowly. \u201cYou came home early because Lydia called you to complain about my new puppy in a fit of pique.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d Derek says, glaring at Stiles, looking totally and crazily <i>betrayed</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you <i>listened</i>,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou <i>came</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says. \u201cObviously.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMove,\u201d Derek says, \u201cI\u2019m coming in to\u2014\u201c and Stiles shuts the door in Derek\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>Tiny had been quiet while Stiles spoke to Derek, but once the door closes he starts yapping frantically. Stiles knows the sound signifies approval, but then most of Tiny\u2019s sounds do. </p>\n<p>When he opens the kitchen door, Tiny leaps towards him like it\u2019s eleven thirty on Valentine\u2019s Day and Stiles is the last packet of Kisses left in the 7-11. \u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says, rolling Tiny onto his back with a hand on his chest, smiling helplessly into Tiny\u2019s ecstatic face. \u201cYou missed me! You did, didn\u2019t you? You wouldn\u2019t ever go away for a week and a half before randomly showing up on my doorstep to tell me I stink. No! Because <i>you</i> are so much better than Derek Hale. Stupid Derek. Stupid Derek would never miss me at all.\u201d </p>\n<p>Tiny yips, and if Stiles wishes Tiny didn\u2019t always agree with him, well, it isn\u2019t as if Tiny actually understands. </p>\n<p>After all, Tiny is just a puppy. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s too young to get these things yet. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles is getting out of his car in the parking lot outside the Sheriff\u2019s Office when he sees Derek glaring at him from between two patrol-cars. Stiles ignores him and goes inside with his dad\u2019s pill. </p>\n<p>The rest of the pack avoided him today, probably at Derek\u2019s instruction, because when Stiles ran Scott down in the home ec room (and Scott tried to take home ec as a freshman and caused the only evacuation of the school Stiles had to that date been party to, so Stiles knew he had no legitimate reason to be there, and Mrs. Brannigan still has that picture of Scott with a red x drawn through his face pinned to the corkboard, so he must have been avoiding her as well as Stiles) and said, \u201cDude, why are you all being such douchebags? You do realise you\u2019re being a giant dick right now?\u201d Scott had winced guiltily and said, \u201cDerek\u2019s dealing with this. Everything will be fine,\u201d and when Stiles had started to ask, \u201cDealing with what?\u201d Scott had ducked behind June Smith and bolted out the door, and Stiles couldn\u2019t even give chase because that ugly cake was for her final exam. She told him all about it. </p>\n<p>But if Derek is keeping <i>his</i> puppies on a leash, Stiles doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019s lurking outside himself. That\u2019s showing a serious lack of judgement, and Derek is usually\u2014okay, sometimes\u2014smarter than that. </p>\n<p>Stiles drops the pill on his dad\u2019s desk, waves at him through the glass of the meeting room, and goes out to confront Derek. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with everyone?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell\u2014\u201c Derek says, and then he has Stiles pinned against the car, nose buried in his neck so he can breathe Stiles in, hands all over him. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Stiles says, heartrate spiking, body quivering, whole being jumping to attention, and then the car alarm starts blaring. </p>\n<p>\u201cWrong,\u201d Derek says, and vanishes. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, as deputies spill towards him. \u201cYour <i>face</i> is wrong.\u201d </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Derek is lurking in odd places over the next couple of days, like behind a drier in the Laundromat when their machine at home breaks down and Stiles has to take a load in, or at the end of the cereal aisle in the grocery store, or in the library stacks somewhere between language and science. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is too close to the front,\u201d Stiles says, as Derek\u2019s body presses him against the stacks. \u201cIf one more person tells my dad they saw you groping me in a public place he actually might have to ask me about it, and that would just be awkward for both of us.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to do it in public if you would let me inside your house,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles ignores the slow burn that ignites. </p>\n<p>Stiles has never been capable of keeping Derek out of his house and he hasn\u2019t suddenly decided to try; he just told his dad Tiny was sick and needed to go into the office with him. His dad is weak, and also the boss, so it\u2019s been working out so far. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you around my dog,\u201d Stiles says as Derek\u2019s hands shove under his shirt, then scramble his tee up until they\u2019re on skin. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Derek says, face twisting. </p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWhat is everybody\u2019s problem with my <i>puppy</i>? I don\u2019t\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth is on his throat, saliva all over the place his pulse is thudding. Stiles\u2019 head falls back against a book that\u2019s sticking out of the shelf\u2014huh, Flemish dialects, he\u2019d thought Flemish <i>was</i> a dialect\u2014and when he manages to shove it back into place Derek is pulling at Stiles\u2019 buttons and Stiles has to slap his hand away. \u201cNo taking anything off in public,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cthis is not the Laundromat, there\u2019s no excuse.\u201d He lets his head fall back again anyway, the way it wants to, lets Derek\u2019s teeth scrape against his jugular and feels all the muscles in his neck and shoulders go liquid. </p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Penrose is the librarian,\u201d he moans. \u201cAnd she\u2019s going to tell my dad this time, that thing in the supermarket was a fluke\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek pulls Stiles in closer, and Stiles knows he\u2019s hard against Derek but he can\u2019t make himself care; it\u2019s Derek\u2019s fault anyway. </p>\n<p>Derek holds him there and tugs at Stiles\u2019 tee until he can bend his head and rub his <i>hair</i> against Stiles\u2019 chest. </p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201c Stiles says. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek straightens. There\u2019s a satisfied rumble coming from his chest. Stiles can\u2019t really hear it, but he can feel it every time it happens, because Derek is always right up against him and trying to get closer. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the library, dude,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI have <i>homework</i> to do. I have to get home\u2014how did you even know I was here?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI tracked you,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI can smell\u2014I can smell you.\u201d He dips his nose behind Stiles\u2019 ear, and Stiles tries to stop his head from lolling to the side without much success. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have to get home,\u201d he says, as Derek draws Stiles\u2019 earlobe into his mouth. \u201cI have to feed\u2014ow!\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s teeth release Stiles\u2019 earlobe and Derek retreats just enough to scowl. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to have a dog,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go home to\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a puppy!\u201d Stiles says, the word meaningless in his mouth by now, frustrated beyond belief. \u201cI thought you guys would <i>like</i> a puppy! I thought it would be like, like a baby wolf to you! What is your problem with Tiny Dominator?\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s brow is starting to look Neanderthal, but he doesn\u2019t answer. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get over it, because he\u2019s my puppy, okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, and when Stiles opens his mouth to argue, \u201cYou\u2019re his.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to have this out.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWe really do. Then\u2014hi, Miss Penrose!\u2014you can stop scandalising the locals, okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>Although he feels a frisson of fear once he says that, because he doesn\u2019t know what Derek is doing here, hands all over him, mouth everywhere but on his <i>mouth</i>, and he doesn\u2019t know what this is, doesn\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be anything other than surprise attacks of presence and touch as Stiles is going about his day, and he doesn\u2019t want it to <i>stop</i>. </p>\n<p>He wets his lips, says nervously, \u201cAnd we can\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cNot you and me. Me and Tiny Dominator.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201c Stiles starts, breaks off to laugh hollowly. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s joking. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to have it out with my <i>puppy</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any point to continuing this conversation unless Tiny Dominator is present for it,\u201d Derek says, and steps away. </p>\n<p>\u201cI just want you to know,\u201d Stiles says to Derek\u2019s retreating back, worried about the welfare of his beloved pet, \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to do anything to him, because I like him more than I like you,\u201d and then has to pretend he doesn\u2019t see how hurt Derek looks. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles is apprehensive about introducing Derek and Tiny to each other. Derek <i>should</i> succumb to Tiny\u2019s manifest charms and get over his weird issues, but what if they don\u2019t get along? What if they hate each other? Derek has a look on his face like he\u2019s already decided. </p>\n<p>This is going to be a disaster. </p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t do this right now,\u201d Stiles says, slowing as he approaches the kitchen door, listening to Tiny lose his mind as they get closer. He doesn\u2019t like keeping Tiny locked in there, but he hasn\u2019t been able to rig anything that\u2019ll keep him downstairs, and it\u2019s better he be confined to one room than stranded on the landing upstairs without food or water. Stiles is probably going to have to install an actual babygate. \u201cMaybe we should wait\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this,\u201d Derek says, and throws open the door. </p>\n<p>Tiny\u2019s fusillade of barks dissolves into high, staccato, joyous yelps when he sees humans. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi crazy puppy,\u201d Stiles says, helpless and fond, but Derek starts growling and Tiny\u2019s noises sound puzzled now. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201c Stiles starts, turning to Derek, who is turning into a <i>werewolf</i> in Stiles\u2019 kitchen. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014the hell!\u201d Stiles finishes, leaping backwards in a move more acrobatic than he would\u2019ve believed possible. He bounces off the wall and sends a picture of himself at his middle-school graduation crashing to the floor. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek is growling steadily, staring down at Tiny, who is wagging his tail slowly, trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. </p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Stiles says, though Derek has, face distorted but still recognisable, body still human. \u201cStop that right now, turn back!\u201d </p>\n<p>The growls increase in volume, and Tiny whines softly, distressed. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring\u2014\u201c Stiles starts, but stops himself before he says <i>my puppy</i>, not sure how Derek will react to that. \u201cThis is really immature,\u201d he says instead. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like it at all.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face shifts towards Stiles, though his eyes don\u2019t leave Tiny, belly pressed to the floor, little body wriggling anxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t talk to Tiny like this, he\u2019s\u2014what\u2019s Tiny Dominator going to do? He\u2019s a puppy! He doesn\u2019t understand whatever the hell you\u2019re trying to communicate, so you can stop hunching like you\u2019re about to pounce on him because I will smack you, okay? I have a newspaper and I am not afraid to use it!\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek makes an exasperated noise, more human than wolf, and when he snaps his head to the side to meet Stiles\u2019 eyes, Stiles has the incomparable experience of watching Derek\u2019s bones shift, flesh move like it\u2019s animated as it smooths down to human. </p>\n<p>By which he means: gross; though that isn\u2019t something he\u2019s going to say to Derek right now, worked up like he is. </p>\n<p>\u201cGross!\u201d he says. Whatever, it\u2019ll distract him. \u201cThat is so disgusting!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t respond,\u201d Derek says, casting an annoyed look down at Tiny. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he respond properly?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cUm, because he isn\u2019t a baby werewolf, he\u2019s just a baby dog?\u201d Stiles suggests. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat counts!\u201d Derek says. \u201cHe can smell me, he knows I\u2019m a challenge.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know werewolves exist, dude. He sees you as human.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHe knows we\u2019re in competition. Why else would he have tried to bite Jackson when he tried to touch you? You even called him <i>Dominator</i>, you saw what was going on, he\u2019s trying to exert his rights\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cJackson wasn\u2019t touching me, he was hitting me,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cTiny was trying to <i>protect</i> me, because I\u2019m his master, I\u2019m his alpha. He isn\u2019t the one who has rights here, Derek.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 breath catches when Derek looks at him, eyes dark, face shadowed and human, achingly human. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI was trying to show him, but he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge my claim.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles says, heart hammering. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u2014what I meant, that wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek is getting closer, ignoring Tiny yipping excitedly at his feet, not understanding why he doesn\u2019t have Derek\u2019s attention. He thinks he\u2019s so big, as big as Derek, and Stiles\u2019 dad keeps telling him not to carry Tiny around so much because he\u2019s developing inaccurate perceptions about his own size, but he will be big one day, and Stiles wants him to know it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI just meant I\u2019m the one who has authority over Tiny,\u201d Stiles says as Derek pushes into his space, pushes against him, holds him there for it. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any, he\u2019s my puppy but he thinks we\u2019re a pack, he thinks he\u2019s my beta and I\u2019m the leader\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek ducks his head, brushes his face against Stiles\u2019, mouths over the curve of his jaw. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the leader,\u201d Stiles says, every bit of him Derek is touching shockingly awake and hungry. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that I\u2019m the leader, I\u2019m the one who\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s hair sweeps against Stiles\u2019 cheek, prickling Stiles and making him start as he raises his head to smile down into Stiles\u2019 face. Stiles\u2019 breath is shaking its way out of his mouth, but he\u2019s too overwhelmed to do anything about it, to even consider anything but what\u2019s in front of him, Derek\u2019s curling lips, Derek\u2019s warm eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the leader of this pack,\u201d Derek says, \u201cyou know I am,\u201d and then they\u2019re kissing. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201c Stiles says when he can, but then Derek is licking into his mouth again, and there are more important things to do than speak. </p>\n<p>When Derek\u2019s mouth moves to Stiles\u2019 throat, the place he always laps at like a dog, Stiles tries to speak again, but only manages to get out, \u201cAh!\u201d when Derek\u2019s teeth scrape slowly down his neck. It takes him a minute to realise he\u2019s clawing at Derek\u2019s shoulders, pressing his hips into Derek\u2019s, and by then Derek is sucking at his neck and all Stiles can do is moan. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m totally the alpha,\u201d he says, once he figures out that he can speak if he moans the words. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have authority over me,\u201d Derek mutters into the soft skin underneath his chin. </p>\n<p>\u201cIn my pack,\u201d Stiles moans. \u201cI\u2019m not in your pack.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek bites down on the flesh between his lips, and Stiles gasps, but then Derek releases him so he can hold Stiles\u2019 head between his hands and tilt it back to glare at him. \u201cYou\u2019re in my pack,\u201d he says, and then his mouth is on Stiles\u2019 neck again, and, \u201cFuck\u2014\u201c Stiles is saying, because Derek is giving him a <i>hickey</i>, fuck, and Stiles\u2019 hands are under Derek\u2019s shirt, nails biting into his skin in a way that must be painful, and that thought just makes him dig in harder, so it\u2019s possibly a little bit hypocritical when he says, \u201cWhat the fuck, dude? How is my dad supposed to ignore that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t,\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have problems,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cYou have so many serious, concerning problems,\u201d but he\u2019s the one offering his throat up for more, so he can\u2019t really talk. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had to miss you,\u201d Derek mumbles awkwardly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had to miss you, you\u2019ve always been here, you\u2019ve always been\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>And Derek\u2019s hands are under Stiles\u2019 shirt, pulling it over his head, doing the same with his own, and it isn\u2019t the first time Derek has rubbed his bare chest against Stiles\u2019, but it\u2019s the first time Stiles has known what it meant, known where it was going to lead. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, as Derek\u2019s hands stroke over the skin on his back, on his hips, pull him in, and Stiles is shivering but he\u2019s warm, it\u2019s so warm. \u201cBut\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not in\u2014\u201c Stiles starts, because he needs to understand what Derek thinks is happening here, but Derek\u2019s eyes flash a warning, so maybe it\u2019s a good thing Tiny starts whining for attention. \u201cI can\u2019t do this in front of my puppy,\u201d Stiles says instead. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes you can,\u201d Derek says swiftly, and then Stiles\u2019 jeans are open and his cock is in Derek\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cThat\u2019s unexpected\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t,\u201d Derek says, dragging one hand down Stiles\u2019 dick as he shucks his own jeans with the other. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Stiles says, indignant. </p>\n<p>\u201cOnly to you,\u201d Derek says. \u201cAre you still surprised after I\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>He groans as he takes both their dicks in his big, warm hand, doesn\u2019t finish the sentence, and Stiles can\u2019t tell if the touch is distracting him or if he just doesn\u2019t want Stiles to know what all the craziness was about. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me,\u201d Stiles says, voice shaky, not able to catch his breath. He feels his back arch towards Derek, sending the top of his head down into Derek\u2019s chest, not a bad place to be, and Derek is still jerking him off, doing them both. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles says, the bitten-off word sounding more like a plea than anything else. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2014\u201c Derek says, hand tightening, and Tiny starts yelping, high and unhappy. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201c so Derek lifts him bodily to the other side of the kitchen door and shuts it against Tiny\u2019s attempt to follow. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t put Stiles down, just holds him against the closed door, grinds against him, and Stiles comes with his teeth sinking deeply into the muscle of Derek\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cMessy,\u201d he says after a while, breathless, hanging onto Derek, who is still shoving up against him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, head thrown back, eyes fluttering wildly under their lids, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014yeah.\u201d </p>\n<p>And when he comes all over Stiles\u2019 stomach and chest and cock he just rubs it all in. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cMore crap to clean up. At least Tiny doesn\u2019t know any better.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Derek says, attention suddenly focussed behind the door where Tiny is still whining softly, able to smell them right beside him. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Stiles says when Derek tries to open the door, and drags him upstairs instead. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s been watching a lot of animal shows, so he isn\u2019t sure where he picked this up, but he <i>knows</i> sometimes you need to keep pets separated for their own good. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Later on, just before his dad is due to get home, Stiles kicks Derek out of bed and goes down to retrieve their shirts while he cleans up. </p>\n<p>Tiny goes insane when Stiles opens the kitchen door, like one of those people who get their feelings all over everybody else at the airport, except that Stiles saw him less than two hours ago. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles tells him, dropping to his knees and trying to hold Tiny\u2019s nose away from Derek all over him, \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you too. I missed you! I did!\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek calls him after a minute, and Stiles lopes back upstairs to throw his shirt at him and take his turn in the bathroom. When he gets out, towelling himself off, Derek and Tiny are staring at each other intensely. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cCould you teach him to get down the stairs? That would be really helpful to me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cStairs are incapable of defeating a member of my pack,\u201d Derek says, not breaking eye-contact. \u201cTiny Dominator can get down them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe really can\u2019t. Or else his sense of humour is <i>byzantine</i>, man\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014and it really isn\u2019t. Also, two hours ago didn\u2019t you think he was a rival alpha or some crap?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles raises a disbelieving eyebrow. \u201cFine. But now you\u2019ve acknowledged you\u2019re part of my pack and he\u2019s recognised my claim, so he\u2019s no longer challenging.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin to\u2014\u201c Stiles starts, but Derek isn\u2019t finished. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s your puppy, of course he\u2019s part of my pack. We\u2019re just establishing statuses.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cStatuses?\u201d </p>\n<p>Tiny drops his head to the ground and whines up at Derek, eyes wide and beseeching. </p>\n<p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cStop\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>Tiny rolls onto his back and bicycles his paws in the air, displaying his belly in Derek\u2019s particular direction. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dude,\u201d Stiles groans. \u201cDid you teach my puppy you\u2019re the alpha? Why would you do that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he needs to recognise reality.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut he was supposed to be <i>my</i> beta!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe still is,\u201d Derek says off-handedly. \u201cSo are the rest of them.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth, shuts it. \u201cI <i>want an explanation</i>,\u201d he says, but Derek is bending to ruffle Tiny\u2019s fur, and then Stiles\u2019 dad\u2019s key is in the door and Derek is out the window. </p>\n<p>Stiles picks Tiny up and waves his paw at the figure vanishing down the street, and all the while he\u2019s thinking, fizzily, <i>okay, one more, one more change</i>.</p>\n<p>Then he pretends he never did that. </p>\n<p>\u201cDeliberately obtuse asshole,\u201d Stiles says, and smiles as Tiny yelps his agreement, because no matter the pecking order, Tiny will always love Stiles the most. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks after that, Stiles is asleep in Derek\u2019s bed when he\u2019s woken by Scott\u2019s voice outside. </p>\n<p>\u201cKeep him away from me!\u201d he says desperately. \u201cLydia, don\u2019t let him, don\u2019t let him, why is he looking at me like that!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI warned you this would happen,\u201d Lydia\u2019s voice says triumphantly, although she\u2019d done no such thing. She\u2019d thought they\u2019d <i>win</i>, hah. \u201cYou need to learn to fight your corner, because say what you like about being Stiles\u2019 best friend, Tiny Dominator is\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cComing with me,\u201d Derek interrupts. \u201cFind something to do and stop bothering us.\u201d </p>\n<p>They scuffle away, and a minute later Derek\u2019s weight dips the mattress beside Stiles. \u201cHey,\u201d Stiles says, face still hidden in the pillow. </p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Derek greets, settling his chin on Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you put him to bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTiny\u2019s big enough not to need to be put to bed,\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, because Derek is always right about things like that, even stupid stuff like the stairs. He knows more about the development of puppies than Stiles had ever managed to internalise by listening to Cesar and chums on a never-ending loop. And now he has Derek he doesn\u2019t need to do that anymore. Score! </p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles says, belatedly suspicious. \u201cHe isn\u2019t allowed to sleep on the bed.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Derek says innocently. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him picking up bad habits,\u201d Stiles says, struggling to stay awake. \u201cI have to maintain a proper bedtime and routine\u2014\u201c </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Derek says, \u201cif you wanted a cub you could have just told me.
