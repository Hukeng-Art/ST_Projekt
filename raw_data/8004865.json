  "text": "<p>The first thing that Yamada Hizashi does after getting home from a long day of school at UA is collapse face first on his bed.</p>\n<p>The second thing he does is text Iida Tensei.</p>\n<p>Tensei takes a good fifteen minutes to reply, which is a little strange, considering his usual texting speed. Then again, he did just get a new phone after his last one got shattered during training, so maybe he\u2019s taking a while to figure out how it works. Finally, though, Hizashi\u2019s phone buzzes with a text and he eagerly flips it open.</p>\n<p>The reply he\u2019s received isn\u2019t quite what he was expecting.</p>\n<p>\n<em>u like that song? i\u2019m p sure i\u2019m going to tear my hair out if i have to hear it 1 more time.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi frowns at the text for a moment, before his phone buzzes with another message.</p>\n<p>\n<em>also i think u have the wrong #.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Which makes a lot more sense than Tensei sending him that first text. Hizashi feels a wave of relief after the near heart attack the first text had given him, but that relief is soon replaced by indignation.</p>\n<p><em>hey!!! that song is quality!!</em> he replies, his fingers tapping quickly at the small buttons on his phone keyboard.</p>\n<p>After he hits send, Hizashi finds himself checking his phone every few seconds, willing the person on the other end to reply. Part of him worries that they won\u2019t \u2013 it was a wrong number, after all \u2013 but thankfully a couple of minutes later his phone buzzes again.</p>\n<p>\n<em>i\u2019ve heard it 5 times in the last hr</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>i guess it is a little overplayed</em>, Hizashi admits, biting his lower lip as he types. <em>but that\u2019s just because it\u2019s so good!!</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>if i hear it one more time i\u2019m going to stab myself. or some1 else.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi can\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow as he reads the new text. Someone\u2019s clearly having a bad day.</p>\n<p>\n<em>wow that\u2019s kind of an intense reaction. did something happen to u today??</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>mayb i\u2019m just an intense person</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi lets out a little snort of amusement at that. He\u2019s not sure how he was picturing the person on the other end of the line before, but now they\u2019ve been solidified in his mind as dark haired and gloomy looking.</p>\n<p>\n<em>oh my god r u some sort of goth teenager???</em>\n</p>\n<p>It takes the stranger a moment longer to reply this time, and Hizashi finds himself absently drumming his fingers over the surface of his bed.</p>\n<p><em>i\u2019m not a fan of punk-rock if that\u2019s what ur insinuating, </em>the person finally replies. Before Hizashi can text back, though, he receives another short text.</p>\n<p>\n<em>are u a teenager?</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>yep!! i\u2019m 16!! </em>he types, briefly wondering if that\u2019s too much information to give out to a complete stranger.<em> also i can\u2019t believe u abbreviated \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d but actually typed out \u201cinsinuating\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>shut up. and u shouldn\u2019t tell strangers ur age. i could be a 50 yr old creeper.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>well u asked and i\u2019m pretty sure ur a teenager too ;)</em>\n</p>\n<p>The way the stranger texts certainly suggests as much, at least from what Hizashi\u2019s seen of old people trying to figure out how phones work.</p>\n<p>\n<em>didn\u2019t any1 ever teach u abt stranger danger?</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>hey it\u2019s not like i\u2019m gonna send u photos or agree to meet u or anything!!! </em>Hizashi protests, feeling a little indignant. Maybe giving out his age wasn\u2019t the best idea, but he\u2019s not a complete idiot.</p>\n<p><em>fine. i\u2019m 16 too, </em>the stranger replies, and Hizashi lets a triumphant grin spread across his face.</p>\n<p>\n<em>now who doesn\u2019t know about stranger danger??? i could have lied about my age!!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>no 50 yr old texts that fast</em>\n</p>\n<p>Well, Hizashi supposes he has a point there. Before he can reply, though, he hears a knock and turns to find his mother standing in the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201cDinner\u2019s ready,\u201d she signs, glancing pointedly at the phone still clutched in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust one sec!\u201d Hizashi signs back, only taking his hands off his phone for a moment to make the hand gestures, before fixing his eyes intently on his phone as he types out another quick message.</p>\n<p>\n<em>i have to go now!! but it was nice talking to u!! even if u have bad taste in music!!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHizashi\u2026\u201d his mother signs again, a hint of annoyance in her movements now. Hizashi grimaces and tosses his phone down on his bed, before following downstairs, not waiting for a reply.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>When Hizashi finally gets back up to his room after dinner and checks his phone, he finds one more text.</p>\n<p>\n<em>you\u2019re weird. but i guess i\u2019ve had worse conversations.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi grins and, after a second of hesitation, he saves the phone number in his contacts as \u201cStranger Danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Hizashi mostly forgets about the brief conversation until the next day at school, when he\u2019s talking with Tensei during their lunch period.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, you didn\u2019t text me last night,\u201d Tensei says, after swallowing a bite of his sandwich.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, crap, yeah, I think I put your number in wrong,\u201d Hizashi replies, with a sheepish laugh. \u201cI got an interesting conversation with a stranger out of it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you realize how sketchy that just sounded?\u201d Tensei snorts, his eyebrows rising up towards his hairline.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you too,\u201d Hizashi groans. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the person I accidentally texted said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI actually find that strangely comforting,\u201d Tensei says, his tone thoughtful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I have them saved in my contacts as \u2018Stranger Danger\u2019,\u201d Hizashi snorts, taking another bite of the apple on his tray.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saved some random person\u2019s number?\u201d Tensei asks, sounding wary again. Hizashi grimaces internally, bracing himself for a lecture.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, they were kind of funny,\u201d Hizashi says. Sure, the person\u2019s sense of humor was sort of sharp and sarcastic, but Hizashi can appreciate that. \u201cI\u2019m probably not going to talk to them again, though. It\u2019s just, you know, like a souvenir, so that I can look at the conversation and laugh or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Tensei replies, but his skepticism is clear in his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not a complete idiot!\u201d Hizashi huffs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to send them photos or agree to meet up with them or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to believe you, but you\u2019re kind of a people pleaser,\u201d Tensei sighs, and Hizashi supposes he has a point. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to get mixed up in something that\u2019s going to come back to bite you \u2013 or worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we talk about something else?\u201d Hizashi groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, how\u2019s the Aizawa plan coming along?\u201d Tensei asks, arching an eyebrow at Hizashi in challenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy am I friends with you?\u201d Hizashi sighs, burying his face in his hands. \u201cAnd for your information, the Aizawa plan is coming along fine. Just slowly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he\u2019s still ignoring you,\u201d Tensei snorts, and Hizashi peeks through his fingers to glare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Hizashi replies. \u201cBut, you know, third time\u2019s the charm, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost two months since he transferred from gen. ed. and he hasn\u2019t talked to <em>anyone</em> voluntarily. Well, except for Kayama-senpai,\u201d Tensei points out, and Hizashi grimaces. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re at your eleventh attempt now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing him down slowly,\u201d Hizashi huffs, his cheeks flushing a little. \u201cHe\u2019ll start replying when I talk to him eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHizashi,\u201d Tensei sighs. \u201cJust give up already. It\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot with that attitude it\u2019s not,\u201d Hizashi replies, stubborn. Tensei rolls his eyes in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, maybe you\u2019re coming on too strong,\u201d Tensei says. \u201cYou need to chill with your awkward crush a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you so mean to me? And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m flirting with him \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to be friendly,\u201d Hizashi complains. \u201cSee, this is why I was reluctant to tell you about the Aizawa situation in the first place!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I would have noticed eventually,\u201d Tensei replies, sounding amused. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly subtle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi kicks him under the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just because of my crush, okay?\u201d Hizashi sighs, picking at his food. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he must be at least a little lonely? I mean, I know a few people were bitter about him winning the sports festival at first, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone\u2019s gotten over that by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, you\u2019ve already tried being friendly,\u201d Tensei replies. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just really introverted or something. You\u2019re probably just annoying him at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Hizashi says, conceding the point.</p>\n<p>Still, the conversation nags at him all throughout the day. They changed the seating chart at the beginning of the semester so that Hizashi sits right behind Aizawa now, and he finds himself staring at the back of Aizawa\u2019s head during Modern Lit, thinking about how to proceed.</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019s just projecting, but he can\u2019t help but think that Aizawa maybe <em>is</em> a little lonely. Sure, he has Kayama-senpai, but she\u2019s a year ahead of them, so it\u2019s not like she and Aizawa can interact during class. Most of the other students in 1-A steer clear of Aizawa, partially because he\u2019s so standoffish and partially because the fact that he transferred into heroics halfway through the year marks him as distinctly <em>other</em>.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Aizawa acts like he doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like no one\u2019s opinion matters to him except his own, like he\u2019s the only one able to define himself and everyone else is inconsequential. And while part of Hizashi is in awe of him and his raw self-confidence, part of Hizashi wonders if Aizawa is really that unaffected or if it\u2019s just an act. Fake it \u2018till you make it, if you will.</p>\n<p>Sure, Hizashi can understand the whole \u201cI\u2019m here to become a hero, not to mess around\u201d sort of mentality, but most everyone in their class is going to become a significant pro-hero someday, so making friends is important for networking, at the very least. Really, it would be in Aizawa\u2019s best interest to make friends.</p>\n<p>Still, despite his best efforts, Aizawa just doesn\u2019t seem to be responding. Really, as of yet the most of a reaction Hizashi\u2019s gotten is a mild glare.</p>\n<p>When Hizashi gets home that evening, he texts Tensei \u2013 using the proper number this time. Tensei replies almost immediately and they chat for a while, until Tensei has to go help do something with his new baby brother. After sending his goodbye text, Hizashi makes a move to close his phone so that he can start on homework, but then he pauses.</p>\n<p>For a moment he\u2019s indecisive, but then he opens his text conversation with \u2018Stranger Danger.\u2019</p>\n<p><em>so there\u2019s this guy i wanna be friends with but he won\u2019t even give me the time of day</em>, he types, hitting \u2018send\u2019 quickly before he loses his nerve.</p>\n<p>As soon as it\u2019s been sent, he flips his phone shut with a click and sets it aside, pulling out his English homework. He manages to lose himself in the problems, but a few minutes later he\u2019s startled out of his concentration by the buzzing of his phone. He flips it open eagerly, however his smile turns into a frown when he finds that all he\u2019s received in reply is: <em>?</em></p>\n<p>For a brief moment, he wonders if Stranger Danger had deleted their texts the previous night and doesn\u2019t recognize the number anymore, but a moment later his phone buzzes with a second message.</p>\n<p>\n<em>y wld u want a friend like that</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi bites his lip as he contemplates how to reply.</p>\n<p>\n<em>he seems cool? like he\u2019s really motivated &amp; doesn\u2019t care what people think about him?? also he doesn\u2019t have many friends and i think he\u2019s kind of lonely.</em>\n</p>\n<p>It takes Stranger Danger a moment to respond this time.</p>\n<p>\n<em>so this is a pity thing</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>no!!!!</em> Hizashi replies quickly, scowling. <em>look i also have a bit of a crush on him?? it\u2019s really not a pity thing.</em></p>\n<p>Once again, Stranger Danger takes their sweet time responding and Hizashi\u2019s about to give up on the conversation and go back to his English homework when he finally receives another message.</p>\n<p>\n<em>r u popular</em>\n</p>\n<p>The question throws Hizashi off guard and he frowns at it for a long moment, before texting, <em>i guess??? what does that have to do with anything??</em></p>\n<p><em>ur definitely popular</em>, Stranger Danger replies, and Hizashi can almost hear the snort in their tone.</p>\n<p>Hizashi\u2019s about to send an annoyed reply, but Stranger Danger beats him to it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>look imagine ur invited 2 a party by some1 who\u2019s nice but who\u2019s popular &amp; u don\u2019t rlly know well. it\u2019s ok at the start cuz they greet u &amp; talk 2 u but then they have 2 go greet some1 else &amp; ur left on ur own w/ a bunch of ppl who r all already friends w/ each other &amp; u just end up in the corner. that\u2019s prob y this person doesn\u2019t wanna get involved w/ u.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi hadn\u2019t really thought about it that way, but he supposes it makes sense, particularly when taking into account the fact that Aizawa transferred so late. Then again, Hizashi\u2019s sure that people would warm up to him quickly enough if he actually made an effort to be friendly once in a while. Friendship is a two way street, after all.</p>\n<p><em>so i should start small before inviting him to a party??? </em>Hizashi replies. <em>like maybe 1 on 1 and then invite another person and so on??</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2026 i guess if that\u2019s how u wanna interpret it</em>, Stranger Danger texts back a moment later. <em>or u cld just give up and save urself the trouble.</em></p>\n<p>Well, Hizashi\u2019s never been the type to give up easily.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>The only thing is, now Hizashi needs a plan. Part of him wants to just go up to Aizawa and ask him to hang out after school, but another part of him is afraid that if he acts so boldly Aizawa will <em>know</em> \u2013 about Hizashi\u2019s crush on him, that is. And while Hizashi would love to be confident enough to simply ask Aizawa out, he figures he should take things slowly at first. Friends, then <em>maybe</em> boyfriends, if Aizawa seems at all interested.</p>\n<p>Hizashi zones out during class more than he probably should, trying to think up a solution, but nothing comes immediately to mind. He could have asked Aizawa to tutor him in some subject, if he weren\u2019t already 2<sup>nd</sup> in the class, with Aizawa coming in 4<sup>th</sup>. With his abysmal English scores, Hizashi\u2019s half tempted to ask Aizawa if he wants some study tips, but he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019d just come off as arrogant then.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still trying to think up ideas when hero training rolls around. They\u2019re doing hero vs villain simulations today, and, as luck would have it, Hizashi gets paired up with Aizawa.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Hizashi says brightly, jogging over to Aizawa. \u201cSo, we\u2019re partners.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery observant of you,\u201d Aizawa replies, his tone dry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever worked together before, have we?\u201d Hizashi muses, doing his best to ignore Aizawa\u2019s jab. \u201cI mean, last time you got pared with Kan \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to be using this time to strategize?\u201d Aizawa interrupts, annoyance growing in his expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we should probably do that,\u201d Hizashi says with a small, sheepish laugh. \u201cSo. You can erase people\u2019s quirks and I can scream really loud.\u201d</p>\n<p>That last comment earns him a small, amused snort from Aizawa, who seems a little caught off guard by his own involuntary reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re up against Kaida and Sakakibara,\u201d Hizashi continues, trying to ignore the swell of pride in his chest at being able to make Aizawa laugh. \u201cKaida\u2019s quirk is mutation-class, so I\u2019ll handle her \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aizawa interrupts, and Hizashi blinks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I\u2019ll deal with Kaida, because her quirk\u2019s mutation-class,\u201d Hizashi repeats, frowning slightly. \u201cYou know, because your quirk won\u2019t work against her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out about that?\u201d Aizawa demands, bristling slightly, like an agitated cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I guess I\u2019m just observant,\u201d Hizashi stutters, smiling weakly. Shit, hopefully Aizawa doesn\u2019t figure out about his huge crush before he\u2019s even had the chance to try to put his \u2018make friends with Aizawa\u2019 plan into action.</p>\n<p>Aizawa studies him carefully for a long moment, but then sighs and says, \u201cAlright. Do you think the other team knows?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Hizashi replies, frowning slightly as he considers it. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re pretty lucky that there aren\u2019t that many people with mutation-class quirks in our year. Most people think that during the sports festival, you took down Kawanaka without your quirk because you were being arrogant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa scowls, an annoyed expression his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that I think that!\u201d Hizashi tacks on quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s just, you know, what some other people thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKaida\u2019s kind of hotheaded,\u201d Aizawa says, and Hizashi frowns, wondering where he\u2019s going with this. \u201cDoes she think I purposely didn\u2019t use my quirk against Kawanaka?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Hizashi replies, biting his lower lip as the thinks. \u201cI mean, she hangs out with Taguchi, though, and he\u2019s pretty vocal about his, um. Issues. With you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if I engaged Kaida, she\u2019d probably think I\u2019m purposely not using my quirk and get pissed,\u201d Aizawa muses, and Hizashi finally catches his drift.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then when she\u2019s focused on you, I\u2019ll strike!\u201d Hizashi announces, punching the air with his fist.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink you\u2019ll be able to avoid the spotlight for a couple of minutes?\u201d Aizawa asks, but his tone is teasing, not mean, and Hizashi finds a dopey grin spreading across his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll manage,\u201d Hizashi sighs overdramatically, and for a moment he thinks he sees the ghost of a smile pass over Aizawa\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>As the training exercise starts, Hizashi feels giddy, a little high off the anticipation of actually working together with Aizawa. Exactly as they had predicted, Sakakibara stays behind to guard the weapon while Kaida barges ahead to attack Hizashi and Aizawa head-on. Aizawa doesn\u2019t hesitate to jump towards Kaida, and Hizashi has to admit that he\u2019s a little impressed. Even though they have a plan in place, it takes some nerve to confront an opponent who you know your quirk will have no effect on, classroom exercise or not.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d Aizawa says, and although his voice is loud, there\u2019s a certain laziness to it. \u201cGo find the missile.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Kaida reacts as predicted, her face flushing a little red with anger at Aizawa\u2019s casual dismissal. Hizashi has to stifle a grin as he darts past Kaida and around the corner to wait for Aizawa\u2019s signal.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little nerve-wracking just waiting, but as much as he wants to peek around the corner and make sure Aizawa\u2019s doing alright, he can\u2019t risk Kaida catching a glimpse of him. Instead, he closes his eyes for a moment and steadies his breathing. A clear, open airway is always important for his quirk, after all.</p>\n<p>He counts the seconds as he waits and tries not to wonder how Aizawa is faring against Kaida. He\u2019s probably just doing a lot of dodging, Hizashi suspects, and although he can\u2019t quite make out the individual words from this distance, Hizashi can hear the frustration in Kaida\u2019s voice increasing with every insult.</p>\n<p>\u201cYamada!\u201d Aizawa finally yells and Hizashi darts back around the corner and screams \u2013 not quite as loudly as he can, because he doesn\u2019t want to compromise the building\u2019s stability or permanently damage anyone\u2019s hearing, but pretty damn loudly.</p>\n<p>As Kaida drops to her knees, looking thoroughly dazed and disoriented, Hizashi briefly worries that he\u2019s overdone it. Good thing he had earplugs to give Aizawa.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Aizawa says, breaking Hizashi from his thoughts. Hizashi blinks as he realizes that Aizawa\u2019s already starting to make his way to the second floor. \u201cWe\u2019ve already used up half our time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight! Coming!\u201d Hizashi replies, scrambling to keep up with Aizawa. There\u2019s no way Sakakibara missed Hizashi\u2019s yell just now, so she\u2019s probably on guard. Now that they\u2019ve lost the element of surprise, they can only hope that numbers \u2013 and possibly skill \u2013 will be enough to overpower her.</p>\n<p>They find her on the top floor. She has a force-field quirk, one which strengthens her barriers the longer she maintains them, and by the surprised look on her face, she\u2019d been expecting Kaida to be able to stall the two of them for longer.</p>\n<p>In fact, it dawns on Hizashi that the reason Kaida didn\u2019t really bother to try and stop him when he got past her was probably because she\u2019s perceived Aizawa\u2019s quirk as the greater threat to Sakakibara\u2019s force-fields. If Hizashi had actually continued on like he\u2019d pretended to, he probably would have just ended up yelling aimlessly at Sakakibara\u2019s force-field until Aizawa showed up (or, if Kaida had been able to stall Aizawa, until their time ran out).</p>\n<p>As it is, Aizawa just activates his quirk, eyes flashing red, and Sakakibara\u2019s force-field flickers for a moment and then vanishes. Then, he pointedly puts his earplugs back in.</p>\n<p>Hizashi grins and lets out an earsplitting scream.</p>\n<p>Sakakibara sways a little, her balance compromised, and Aizawa lunges forward to neatly sweep her off her feet. Hizashi saunters on over, pleased to see that they still have a whole two minutes before their time is up, and reaches out to touch the missile. However, before his hand makes contact, he sees a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>Vaguely, in the back of his mind, he realizes that in their rush to get to the missile, they\u2019d neglected to tie Kaida up.</p>\n<p>Almost in slow motion, Hizashi watches as Kaida takes a swing at Aizawa\u2019s exposed back, the sharp spines jutting out of her arm glinting dangerously. Hizashi\u2019s first instinct is to scream, but while that would affect Kaida\u2019s balance some, based on her stance it would probably just make her fall forward onto Aizawa.</p>\n<p>So Hizashi lunges forward without a second thought.</p>\n<p>As he moves, out of the corner of his eye he sees Aizawa catch a glimpse of Kaida, his eyes widening. It\u2019s a second too late for him to dodge, though, and his quirk\u2019s ineffectiveness against mutation-class quirks leaves him a sitting duck.</p>\n<p>Hizashi tackles Aizawa to the floor and has to bite his lip so hard he breaks skin to keep from crying out as Kaida\u2019s spines dig into his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYamada? Yamada!\u201d Aizawa yells, squirming underneath Hizashi. Idly, Hizashi thinks this would be a terribly awkward situation, if he were able to think about anything other than the searing pain in his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god \u2013 \u201d he hears Kaida say from somewhere behind him, her voice uncharacteristically nervous.</p>\n<p>However, Hizashi ignores both of them as he realizes that neither he nor Aizawa have technically touched the missile yet. He struggles into a more upright position, ignoring Aizawa as he says, \u201cYamada, you shouldn\u2019t \u2013 \u201d and taps his hand against the missile.</p>\n<p>When he pulls his hand away, he leaves a bloody handprint behind. It\u2019s\u2026 kind of disturbing looking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat sort of idiot are you?\u201d Aizawa hisses, and Hizashi lets out a yelp of pain as Aizawa tugs at his jacket, wrestling it off of his shoulder to inspect the damage.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I just saved you!\u201d Hizashi says through gritted teeth as Aizawa prods at his wound.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Recovery Girl,\u201d Kaida mutters before hightailing it out of the room, Sakakibara following after her with a, \u201cI\u2019ll get Sensei!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOff,\u201d Aizawa demands, tugging at Hizashi\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Hey, you can\u2019t just \u2013 \u201d Hizashi sputters, his cheeks heating as Aizawa tries to drag the shirt up over his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need something to stanch the bleeding with,\u201d Aizawa says, finally managing to get the shirt over Hizashi\u2019s head, before balling it up and pressing it against Hizashi\u2019s ragged mess of a shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Hizashi gasps, tears pricking at the corners of his eyes as Aizawa puts pressure on the wound. \u201cFucking shit <em>fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re not a complete goody two shoes,\u201d Aizawa drawls, but there\u2019s a certain softness to his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoody two shoes?\u201d Hizashi repeats around gritted teeth, his brow furrowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, \u2018let\u2019s all get along and be friends!\u2019\u201d Aizawa says, mimicking Hizashi\u2019s voice terribly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not sound like that!\u201d Hizashi sputters, his cheeks heating. \u201cAnd there are people I don\u2019t like!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Aizawa asks, quirking an eyebrow at Hizashi in challenge. \u201cLike who?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlenty of people,\u201d Hizashi mumbles, trying to focus on the conversation instead of the throbbing pain in his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Aizawa replies, sounding unconvinced.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaguchi,\u201d Hizashi blurts out, earning him a surprised expression from Aizawa. \u201cI don\u2019t like Taguchi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Aizawa asks, and he can\u2019t quite keep the genuine curiosity from his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s an asshole who insults people behind their backs,\u201d Hizashi huffs, and Aizawa \u2013</p>\n<p>Aizawa laughs.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not one of those small, amused snorts Hizashi\u2019s heard him make before, but a sharp, full sound. Hizashi can\u2019t help but gape for a moment, wondering if blood loss has made him delirious or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a goody two shoes thing to say,\u201d Aizawa finally replies, a smirk on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Hizashi grumbles, his cheeks heating.</p>\n<p>Before Aizawa can reply, though, Recovery Girl appears in the doorway and makes her way over to Hizashi. She tuts a little as she shoos Aizawa aside and removes the \u2013 now blood soaked \u2013 t-shirt from Hizashi\u2019s shoulder. Thankfully, she heals up the wound fairly quickly, though.</p>\n<p>And when Aizawa offers to help support him as he walks to the infirmary, slinging Hizashi\u2019s undamaged arm over his shoulders, Hizashi can\u2019t help but think that today was a reasonable success.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Hizashi\u2019s at home, lying in bed and listening to music, when he gets the text. His shoulder is still a little sore from earlier, despite being healed by Recovery Girl, and he winces a little as he reaches for his phone.</p>\n<p>\n<em>how do u thank some1</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really not the sort of text he\u2019d expected to receive from Stranger Danger and he stares at it for a long moment.</p>\n<p><em>u just say \u201cthank you\u201d??? </em>he finally replies.</p>\n<p>This time, it takes barely a moment for Stranger Danger to text him back.</p>\n<p>\n<em>i mean 4 smth big</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi frowns as he reads the reply, his brow furrowing.</p>\n<p>\n<em>what kind of big??</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>like say u almost got hit by a car but some1 pushed u out of the way &amp; got hurt instead of u</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi\u2019s eyes widen as he reads the response, his fingers flying over the keyboard of his flip-phone.</p>\n<p><em>oh my god u almost got hit by a car????? </em>he replies, worrying his lower lip with his teeth as he types.</p>\n<p>\n<em>no! it was just similar</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>similar to getting hit by a car???</em> Hizashi asks, wincing a little as his sore shoulder throbs a bit. He massages it for a moment and wonders if getting stabbed during training feels anything like getting hit by a car.</p>\n<p><em>look i just need 2 know how 2 thank this guy, </em>Stranger Danger replies, their grumpiness and frustration evident even when distorted by text speak.</p>\n<p><em>well saying \u201cthank you\u201d is still a good place to start, </em>Hizashi points out.</p>\n<p>This time, it takes Stranger Danger a little longer to reply, and briefly Hizashi wonders if they\u2019ve gotten too frustrated and decided to ask someone else. Then again, Hizashi has to wonder how many friends they have if they\u2019re asking a complete stranger for advice on how to thank someone.</p>\n<p>\n<em>that doesn\u2019t feel like enough</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi lets out a little sigh, slumping back onto his bed and trying to think up some better advice. How would he want Aizawa to thank him, after today\u2019s situation? Briefly, he imagines requesting a kiss and his cheeks flush bright pink before he shoves that thought from his mind.</p>\n<p><em>how well do u know this guy?? </em>Hizashi finally asks.</p>\n<p><em>we\u2019re in the same class but we haven\u2019t talked much before, </em>Stranger Danger replies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>well if ur in the same class then maybe u could figure out what he likes or something he wants and repay him that way, </em>Hizashi suggests.</p>\n<p>It seems like reasonable enough advice, in his opinion, even if it was partially inspired by his selfish desire for Aizawa to repay him for his earlier heroism with a kiss. (It wouldn\u2019t even have to be a really involved kiss, really! Just, you know, a thank you kiss. Or something.)</p>\n<p>\n<em>ok</em>\n</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a brief delay, but then Stranger Danger tacks on: <em>thanks.</em></p>\n<p>It appears Stranger Danger can be taught, Hizashi thinks, smiling to himself.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>The aching in Hizashi\u2019s shoulder has almost entirely vanished by the next morning. It still feels strange to move it, though, like he\u2019s not quite used to all of the newly regenerated muscle yet, and so he slings his backpack over his opposite shoulder as he walks to school.</p>\n<p>When he arrives at UA and enters 1-A\u2019s classroom, he\u2019s surprised to find Aizawa already there, sitting at his desk. While Aizawa\u2019s never late, he\u2019s certainly never <em>early</em>, and Hizashi finds himself staring for a moment as Aizawa glares at his phone, muttering something under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d Hizashi finally manages, plastering a smile on his face and making his way over to his desk. Aizawa startles a little, looking over at Hizashi and closing his phone with a sharp click.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Aizawa mumbles. He pauses for a second and then asks, \u201cHow\u2019s your shoulder?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill feels a little weird, but it doesn\u2019t hurt or anything,\u201d Hizashi answers, twisting his arm to demonstrate his range of movement. Aizawa watches him intently, as if looking for any signs of pain, and Hizashi does his best to fight the butterflies in his stomach at the feeling of Aizawa\u2019s eyes on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Aizawa says suddenly, startling Hizashi. \u201cFor what you did yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Hizashi replies, unable to entirely keep the surprise from his tone. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you seriously just offer to throw yourself out in front of danger for me anytime?\u201d Aizawa asks, a hint of amusement in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, within reason,\u201d Hizashi answers, a smile spreading over his face. \u201cIf there are insects involved, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of bugs?\u201d Aizawa asks, sounding genuinely surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just so\u2026\u201d Hizashi tries to explain, shuddering a little. \u201c<em>Crawly</em>. And they have too many legs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, so you can protect me from bodily harm and I can protect you from bugs,\u201d Aizawa snorts, the ghost of a smile on his face. Hizashi can\u2019t help but stare a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like an equal exchange,\u201d Hizashi finally manages.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, though,\u201d Aizawa says, his expression turning serious. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to thank you, just say so. I mean, I still think it was kind of stupid of you to just jump out in front of Kaida like that, but. Thanks. I owe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi stares at Aizawa for a moment, caught off guard, and does his best not to think about thank-you kisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you wanna go to the arcade with me?\u201d Hizashi blurts out, the words spilling past his lips before he can overthink them. \u201cAfter school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Aizawa answers easily, catching Hizashi off guard.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hizashi replies, blinking at Aizawa.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that not the answer you wanted?\u201d Aizawa asks, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No, I do want you to go to the arcade with me, I was just kind of surprised you agreed,\u201d Hizashi laughs. \u201cI mean, I guess you\u2019re kind of obligated because I helped you out yesterday, but, you know. Thanks for agreeing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa stares at him for a long moment and then says, \u201cYou\u2019re weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Hizashi sputters, his cheeks heating.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that in a bad way,\u201d Aizawa huffs. \u201cYou kind of remind me of someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Hizashi can ask what he means by that, though, a handful of their classmates come spilling into the room. Iida comes directly over to greet Hizashi, and a few other people crowd around him to ask how his shoulder\u2019s doing, effectively cutting off his conversation with Aizawa.</p>\n<p>However, despite the many distractions the school day provides, Hizashi isn\u2019t quite able to keep his mind off of the fact that he and Aizawa are actually going to hang out after school. He\u2019s been trying to get Aizawa to just talk to him for months now and the idea of them actually doing something together is more than a little surreal, even if Aizawa is just doing it out of obligation.</p>\n<p>The end of the day comes around both too slowly and too quickly, and Hizashi feels like his heart is racing two times too fast as he comes over to Aizawa after class. He rocks back on his heels nervously, his hands shoved in his pockets, as he waits for Aizawa to finish packing up his books.</p>\n<p>\u201cSooooo,\u201d Hizashi says, drawing out the vowel. \u201cWhat sort of arcade games do you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not bad at prize games,\u201d Aizawa replies with a shrug as they head out of the classroom. \u201cYou know, the ones with the cranes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhh, really?\u201d Hizashi says. \u201cI\u2019m terrible at those. I have the high score on Dance Dance Revolution, though!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to make me play that, are you?\u201d Aizawa asks, sounding a little wary.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, c\u2019mon, aren\u2019t you supposed to be repaying me for saving your life?\u201d Hizashi whines, giving Aizawa his best puppy dog eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go quite that far,\u201d Aizawa snorts, but there\u2019s a hint of amusement in his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, severe bodily harm, then,\u201d Hizashi says as exit the school doors and start down the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t actually sustain any permanent damage,\u201d Aizawa replies, and Hizashi supposes he has a bit of a point. \u201cYour arm\u2019s perfectly fine today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat an ingrate,\u201d Hizashi sighs overdramatically, his tone exaggerated enough that hopefully Aizawa can tell that he\u2019s joking. \u201cSee if I ever save you from <em>severe physical pain</em> again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one trying to get me to play DDR,\u201d Aizawa snorts. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that counts as severe physical pain to some people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, we can argue about this later,\u201d Hizashi huffs as they enter the arcade, taking in the bright neon lights and bustle of people. \u201cFirst you gotta show me this prize game skill you were bragging about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bragging!\u201d Aizawa protests, his cheeks going a little pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not good at prize games?\u201d Hizashi asks, a hint of teasing challenge to his tone.</p>\n<p>Aizawa narrows his eyes a little dangerously and then says, \u201cFine. Hold my bag.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi takes it eagerly as Aizawa marches over to a plexiglas case full of stuffed animals. Hizashi watches on in fascination as Aizawa studies the layout of the prizes, frowning slightly, before digging his wallet out of his pocket and inserting a couple of coins.</p>\n<p>Honestly, it\u2019s a little hard for Hizashi to pay attention to Aizawa\u2019s technique when Aizawa bites his lower lip in concentration as he maneuvers the crane, his lip plump and pink under his teeth. Hizashi manages to tear his eyes away after a few moments, though, to find that Aizawa\u2019s already managed to pick up a stuffed cat and is skillfully maneuvering it over to the drop slot. He really wasn\u2019t lying about being pretty good at prize games.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Aizawa says as he fishes the cutesy stuffed cat out of the prize slot and all but shoves it into Hizashi\u2019s hands. \u201cYou were the one who wanted me to prove that I\u2019m actually good at these, so you have to carry it around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi has to sternly remind himself that this is <em>not a date</em> as he clutches the stuffed cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to try DDR?\u201d Hizashi finally manages to ask. \u201cYou have pretty good coordination. You\u2019d probably be good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, please?\u201d Hizashi cajoles. \u201cYou said you owed me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s quiet for a very long moment, but then he sighs and says, \u201c<em>Once</em>, alright? I\u2019ll do it once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Hizashi exclaims, punching the air. Aizawa rolls his eyes, but follows Hizashi over to the DDR consoles. \u201cYou\u2019ve played before, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few times,\u201d Aizawa mutters, shrugging.</p>\n<p>Thankfully there\u2019s no one already playing, so Hizashi sets their bags down next to the dance platforms, placing the stuffed cat carefully on top of them. Reluctantly, Aizawa steps up onto the dance platform next to Hizashi.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; we can pick something easy,\u201d Hizashi says as he fiddles with the controls, trying to determine what will fit Aizawa\u2019s skill level (or lack thereof) best.</p>\n<p>As the song starts up, Hizashi positions himself on the dance platform, bouncing a little on the balls of his feet in anticipation. He knows this routine well enough that he could probably do it in his sleep, and he can\u2019t help but glance over at Aizawa, wondering how he\u2019ll fare.</p>\n<p>When he dances, Hizashi puts his whole body into it. He always feels awkward when just stomping his feet around, and he\u2019s unable to keep himself from putting a little showmanship into it. Today in particular, he can\u2019t help but up his game, wanting to show off a little for Aizawa.</p>\n<p>He spares a moment to glance over at Aizawa and is surprised to find that he doesn\u2019t look nearly as concentrated as Hizashi had been expecting. In fact, he looks almost bored. And, when Hizashi looks back at the screen, his eyes widen as he realizes that, so far, Aizawa has maintained a perfect score.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, you liar!\u201d Hizashi exclaims as the song ends and the game congratulates them both on their perfect scores. \u201cYou\u2019ve totally played this before!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI might have the PlayStation version at home,\u201d Aizawa replies, a smug little smirk on his face. \u201cBut I\u2019ve only played the arcade version a couple of times, so I wasn\u2019t technically lying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, you should have just pretended to be horrible, because now I\u2019m gonna make you play again, on Trick and Maniac level this time,\u201d Hizashi huffs. \u201cNo more Basic mode.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you insist,\u201d Aizawa sighs \u2013 and then takes off his uniform jacket, reaching a hand up to loosen his tie. Hizashi swallows thickly and tries not to stare.</p>\n<p>By the time they\u2019re finished with their third song, they\u2019re starting to gather a crowd. Aizawa\u2019s been holding his own pretty well so far, although when they switched to Maniac level, his score slipped a little behind Hizashi\u2019s. The onlookers don\u2019t seem to be helping Aizawa\u2019s performance either, Hizashi realizes. For all that Aizawa ignores their classmates in 1-A, Hizashi doesn\u2019t miss the way he tenses up a little as more and more people gather around to watch.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Aizawa,\u201d Hizashi announces as they finish up their current song. \u201cWanna see me try to dance both parts at once?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never actually done both parts for a song harder than Trick level, but hey, if he ends up falling flat on his face in front of crowd of people, he might be able to get another laugh out of Aizawa. At least this\u2019ll give Aizawa an excuse to slip out of the limelight without onlookers trying to cajole him into dancing more.</p>\n<p>Aizawa looks at him carefully for a long moment and then says, \u201cDon\u2019t fall on your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch the master work,\u201d Hizashi replies, making a show of rolling his shoulders and unbuttoning his shirt cuffs.</p>\n<p>Amazingly enough, Hizashi manages to avoid falling at any point during the song. It\u2019s a near thing a couple of times, though, and when he finally finishes his breathing is labored and he can already feel his legs starting to ache. His score isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 by a larger margin than he was hoping, actually \u2013 but it\u2019s not all that bad, considering.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s it folks!\u201d he announces, turning to face the crowd and striking his best pose. \u201cThanks for watching!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some scattered applause and cheering before people begin to disperse, going back to their own gaming now that the show is over.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good at this,\u201d Aizawa says suddenly, making Hizashi look over at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt DDR?\u201d Hizashi asks, frowning slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah, but I what I meant was that you\u2019re really good at entertaining people, I guess,\u201d Aizawa answers, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a good hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Hizashi replies, his heartrate speeding up involuntarily. \u201cWow, uh, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both fall silent for a long moment, and Hizashi wracks his mind for something to say, but he has no clue how to respond after receiving this sort of praise from <em>Aizawa</em>, of all people.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting kind of late,\u201d Aizawa says suddenly, breaking the silence. \u201cI should probably head home soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Hizashi replies, unable to entirely keep the disappointment from his tone. \u201cDo you have time to do one more thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Aizawa answers, giving Hizashi a slightly confused look.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Hizashi says, a small smile spreading across his lips as he picks up his bag and heads over to the other side of the arcade, Aizawa trailing after him a little warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cA photo booth?\u201d Aizawa asks, frowning a little, when Hizashi finally comes to a stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun!\u201d Hizashi insists, herding a reluctant Aizawa into the booth. He always forgets how small these things actually are, and he has to fight a blush as he finds himself squished a little closer to Aizawa than he'd been anticipating. \u201cNow you\u2019ll have a souvenir to remember me by!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t my memories enough of a souvenir?\u201d Aizawa asks dryly, but he doesn\u2019t try to push his way back out of the photo booth.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust smile for the camera,\u201d Hizashi retorts, throwing an arm around Aizawa\u2019s shoulders and grinning.</p>\n<p>In the end, Aizawa only smiles in the last photo, but it\u2019s a small, soft smile that makes Hizashi\u2019s heart catch in his throat.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s really got it bad.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>When Hizashi gets home, he spends a long time staring at the photos, before finally taping them to his mirror. With a sigh, he digs out his math textbook, grimacing as he looks over all the problems he still has to do.</p>\n<p>However, he\u2019s only three problems in before his phone buzzes with a text.</p>\n<p>\n<em>u have a crush on some1 right</em>\n</p>\n<p>It takes a moment for Hizashi to realize that it\u2019s from Stranger Danger and he frowns as he texts, <em>yeah???</em></p>\n<p><em>how do u know if u have a crush on some1, </em>Stranger Danger replies, almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Hizashi stares at the message for a long moment as he considers how to answer.</p>\n<p><em>well u think about the person all the time, </em>Hizashi finally replies. <em>or more than u normally think about other people, at least. and sometimes you get a funny feeling in ur chest when they look at u or smile and u just really really want them to like u.</em></p>\n<p>It takes much longer for Stranger Danger to reply this time.</p>\n<p>\n<em>i think i have a crush on some1</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>r u gonna ask them out??? </em>Hizashi asks eagerly, and tries not to think about how he\u2019s already trying to live vicariously through Stranger Danger, considering his own cowardice when it comes to the Aizawa situation.</p>\n<p><em>i literally just figured out i have a crush on him</em>, Stranger Danger texts back, and Hizashi can almost hear the huff in their tone. <em>i need time 2 process.</em></p>\n<p>Well, Hizashi supposes they have a point.</p>\n<p><em>what\u2019s this guy like?? </em>Hizashi asks. Vaguely, he realizes that he still knows next to nothing about Stranger Danger, other than the fact that they\u2019re sixteen. Hell, he doesn\u2019t even know what pronouns to use for them.</p>\n<p>\n<em>loud</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi stares at the short text, wondering how Stranger Danger has a crush on this guy if that\u2019s all they can come up with.</p>\n<p>\n<em>&amp; rlly nice. a ppl person. kind of handsome.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>oooh, handsome?? ur breaking out the big compliments here, </em>Hizashi replies, a grin slipping onto his face.</p>\n<p><em>i said KIND OF handsome</em>, Stranger Danger protests.</p>\n<p><em>uh huh, </em>Hizashi replies, hoping his teasing tone is apparent in the short message.</p>\n<p><em>he\u2019s the guy who sort of saved me the other day</em>, Stranger Danger admits, and briefly Hizashi\u2019s mind goes back to when he tried to protect Aizawa during training. He shakes his head to banish the image. Just because Stranger Danger\u2019s crushing on the guy that saved them doesn\u2019t mean that Aizawa\u2019s going to suddenly fall head over heels for him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>so u got urself a knight in shining armor!!</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>i guess. my dad\u2019s already teasing me abt it cuz we hung out today &amp; i don\u2019t normally hang out w/ ppl after school, </em>Stranger Danger replies.</p>\n<p>Hizashi frowns a little as he reads the text. Honestly, the whole situation kind of sounds like what\u2019s happened between him and Aizawa recently \u2013 him saving Aizawa during practice and then the two of them going to the arcade this afternoon. Still, that would be a hell of a coincidence.</p>\n<p><em>ur mom\u2019s not teasing u too?? </em>Hizashi asks, trying to forget his little conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p>It takes a moment longer than usual for Stranger Danger to reply this time.</p>\n<p>\n<em>i don\u2019t have a mom</em>\n</p>\n<p>Well, shit. Hizashi winces a little at his own callousness. Really, he should know better, considering his own family situation.</p>\n<p><em>i mean i have 1. i just don\u2019t know her, </em>Stranger Danger tacks on.</p>\n<p><em>ahhh sorry!! i didn\u2019t mean to assume, </em>Hizashi replies, worrying his lower lip with his teeth as he types. He hesitates for a moment but then adds, <em>i don\u2019t really know mine either.</em></p>\n<p>After he hits sends, he realizes that he probably needs to add a little more explanation that that.</p>\n<p>\n<em>my birth parents, i mean. i\u2019m adopted.</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not something he\u2019s told anyone at school, except for Iida. He\u2019s not embarrassed of his mom or being adopted or anything, but it\u2019s just that, well. Talking about being adopted eventually leads to talking about the circumstances of his adoption, and he\u2019s not really fond of telling people that he cried so loudly as a baby that his birth parents couldn\u2019t take care of him without risking permanent hearing damage \u2013 which, consequently, is why he got placed with Yamada Tomiko, who was born deaf. No risk of hearing loss there.</p>\n<p><em>i\u2019ve only told one other person about it since starting high school, </em>Hizashi admits.</p>\n<p>It takes Stranger Danger a long moment to reply.</p>\n<p><em>i\u2019ve only told 1 other person abt my mom ever so i guess we have smth in common</em>, Stranger Danger finally says. <em>thanx 4 trusting me i guess.</em></p>\n<p><em>u know, spelling \u201cthanks\u201d with an x kind of ruins the mood here, </em>Hizashi texts back, a soft smile spreading over his lips.</p>\n<p><em>it\u2019s a letter shorter, </em>Stranger Danger protests.</p>\n<p><em>ur kind of a lazy texter, aren\u2019t u?? </em>Hizashi replies, still smiling.</p>\n<p>\n<em>shut up. it\u2019s efficient.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Well, Hizashi can\u2019t really argue with them on that point.</p>\n<p><em>i have 2 go now, </em>Stranger Danger says before Hizashi can reply to his previous text. <em>my dad needs help with dinner or smth.</em></p>\n<p><em>alright!! </em>Hizashi says. <em>good luck with ur crush!!</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>u too. &amp; thanx 4 the advice.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>anytime!! </em>Hizashi answers, smiling softly, and he can\u2019t help but hope that Stranger Danger\u2019s crush works out. Maybe that\u2019ll give him the courage to try asking Aizawa out.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>In the chaos of the last few days\u2019 events, Hizashi realizes that he\u2019s gotten so caught up in his little crush on Aizawa that he\u2019s forgotten his original goal: <em>befriending</em> Aizawa. The arcade excursion the other day was a good start, he thinks. Stranger Danger had suggested that he hang out with Aizawa one on one first, before adding more people.</p>\n<p>But, well, as much as Hizashi would love to selfishly keep Aizawa to himself and do something with just the two of them again, it\u2019s probably time for him to try broadening Aizawa\u2019s friend group by adding another person.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Aizawa!\u201d Hizashi says, coming over to Aizawa after class as he\u2019s packing up his things. \u201cDo you wanna go to the arcade with me again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa blinks at him, clearly surprised, but then he says, \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Hizashi chirps, a grin spreading across his face. Then, he turns and yells, \u201cHey, Tensei, you\u2019re coming too, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already said yes when you asked me earlier,\u201d Tensei huffs, slinging his bag over his shoulder. Hizashi doesn\u2019t miss the slightly uncertain way he eyes Aizawa, though.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, as they walk over to the arcade, Tensei hangs back a little, and when Hizashi slows his own pace to fall in step with him, Tensei softly asks, \u201cHow\u2019d you get Aizawa to come with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just that charming,\u201d Hizashi huffs.</p>\n<p>Tensei gives him a flat look.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I made him come with me yesterday to pay me back for the whole training accident,\u201d Hizashi sighs, glancing briefly over at Aizawa, who\u2019s walking slightly ahead of them, oblivious. \u201cI guess he had fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time imagining Aizawa at an arcade,\u201d Tensei says, skepticism clear in his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s weirdly good at DDR,\u201d Hizashi replies. \u201cHe was actually able to keep up with me on Maniac level!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tensei blinks at him, clearly surprised, and then says, \u201cYou know, I was skeptical of your crush at first, but now I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re soulmates or something. You finally have someone to share your weird DDR obsession with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Hizashi sputters, his cheeks heating. \u201cIt\u2019s not weird!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird,\u201d Tensei replies, and Hizashi glares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Hizashi huffs. \u201cJust \u2013 try to get along with him, I guess? He\u2019s actually really fun to hang out with. I <em>want</em> you two to like each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Tensei says.</p>\n<p>In the end, things do actually work out pretty well. Tensei wipes the floor with Aizawa in Street Fighter, but Aizawa returns the favor in all the prize games. In fact, Hizashi thinks he even sees them share a commiserating look when he decides to show off his DDR skills by trying to do double player mode by himself again.</p>\n<p>The one thing Hizashi\u2019s a little disappointed about is that he doesn\u2019t get much time alone with Aizawa. Sure, they play DDR together a couple of times, but that\u2019s partially because Tensei insists Aizawa prove that Hizashi wasn\u2019t just over-exaggerating his abilities. It\u2019s not like the previous day, when he had Aizawa\u2019s attention all to himself.</p>\n<p>But this isn\u2019t supposed to be about fostering his crush. This is supposed to be about helping Aizawa make friends. If Aizawa happens to fall for him in the meantime, that\u2019s just a bonus. (Well, a very unlikely bonus, but Hizashi can dream.)</p>\n<p>When Hizashi finally gets home from the game, his feet a little sore from hero training and too much DDR, he falls down on his bed face first and just lies there for a long moment. Then, he digs his phone out of his pocket to send a text.</p>\n<p>\n<em>i think i\u2019m sabotaging myself</em>\n</p>\n<p>It takes about a minute for Stranger Danger to respond, sending him simply: <em>?</em></p>\n<p><em>i hung out with the guy i have a crush on today but i invited another friend along too, </em>Hizashi explains, pulling himself up off his stomach and sitting cross-legged on his bed so he can text more easily.</p>\n<p>\n<em>this is the guy u thought was lonely right?</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>well, yeah, </em>Hizashi answers. <em>and i think he had a good time today??? but i wish i had more time with him to myself tbh. i feel really selfish for thinking that tho.</em></p>\n<p>It takes Stranger Danger a long moment to reply this time.</p>\n<p>\n<em>u have a hero complex don\u2019t u</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi feels his cheeks flush a little as he reads the message. He supposes he sort of does, but he <em>is</em> aiming to become a pro-hero, after all.</p>\n<p>\n<em>if ur worried abt sending mxd signals or smth tho then mayb invite other ppl along sometimes but also make a point of spending time w/ this guy on ur own</em>\n</p>\n<p>That\u2026 actually sounds like reasonable advice. He won\u2019t feel like he\u2019s monopolizing all of Aizawa\u2019s time, and he\u2019ll still be able to have the opportunity to spend some time alone with Aizawa.</p>\n<p><em>thanks for the advice!! </em>Hizashi replies. <em>how are u faring with ur crush??</em></p>\n<p><em>i can\u2019t really tell if he\u2019s interested or not, </em>Stranger Danger texts back.</p>\n<p><em>what do u mean by that?? </em>Hizashi asks, frowning slightly.</p>\n<p><em>he\u2019s 2 nice, </em>Stranger Danger answers, and they seem almost disgruntled by it. Hizashi\u2019s a little miffed. <em>idk if he actually likes me or if he\u2019s just being nice.</em></p>\n<p>Hizashi\u2019s frown deepens as he reads Stranger Danger\u2019s text. It\u2019s not exactly a problem he\u2019s ever had to deal with, considering Aizawa doesn\u2019t seem to like anyone very much. Figuring out where he stands with Aizawa almost seems more straightforward, considering he\u2019s not really fighting anyone for Aizawa\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p><em>well has this guy saved anyone else from getting hit by a car?? </em>Hizashi finally asks.</p>\n<p><em>it wasn\u2019t actually a car, </em>Stranger Danger replies, and Hizashi can almost hear the huff in their tone. <em>but no, he hasn\u2019t. that\u2019s mayb cuz he hasn\u2019t had the chance tho.</em></p>\n<p><em>speaking as a friendly person, if i specifically go out of my way to talk to someone instead of just talking with them when they come to me, that means i like them more, </em>Hizashi says. <em>maybe ur crush is like that.</em></p>\n<p><em>mayb, </em>Stranger Danger replies simply.</p>\n<p><em>hey, keep ur hopes up!! </em>Hizashi says. <em>this guy saving u has gotta mean something!!</em></p>\n<p><em>i guess, </em>Stranger Danger texts back, sounding less than convinced.</p>\n<p><em>i\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out, </em>Hizashi assures them.</p>\n<p><em>thanx</em>, Stranger Danger replies. <em>u 2.</em></p>\n<p>Hizashi can only hope that he\u2019ll be that lucky. He appreciates the sentiment, though.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Going to the arcade with Aizawa becomes a regular thing, much to Hizashi\u2019s delight. Sometimes Tensei comes along, but other times he has to go straight home after school to watch his baby brother. Hizashi\u2019s kind of glad that he\u2019s an only child.</p>\n<p>(He got to hold baby Tenya once, which felt magical for about ten seconds before Tenya spit up on him. He\u2019s begged out of holding babies since.)</p>\n<p>Hizashi thinks he\u2019s really making progress with Aizawa. Well, maybe not really romantically, but as a friend, at least. He might even have the courage to ask Aizawa out, in like a year or so.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so hungry,\u201d Hizashi groans as he steps off the DDR platform, the screen declaring that he\u2019s gotten marginally better at doing double person mode by himself. \u201cWanna get something to eat? There\u2019s a caf\u00e9 across the street.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to spoil your dinner,\u201d Aizawa snorts, but he shrugs on his jacket and picks up his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am perfectly capable of eating both cake and dinner,\u201d Hizashi huffs, his shoulder brushing against Aizawa\u2019s as they walk towards the arcade exit.</p>\n<p>They end up seated in a booth in one corner of the caf\u00e9, and Hizashi has to ignore the pounding of his heart as he thinks that this is a little bit like a date. He peers over the top of his menu at Aizawa and wonders if maybe he should say something now, just blurt it out and get it over with. Aizawa seems to enjoy \u2013 or at least tolerate \u2013 his presence, and it\u2019ll probably be easy to get his feelings out of the way now before they deepen their friendship and have more to lose.</p>\n<p>But Hizashi\u2019s not quite that brave. Instead he says, \u201cI\u2019m definitely getting the triple chocolate cake. What about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStrawberry,\u201d Aizawa answers without hesitation.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot something chocolate?\u201d Hizashi asks, cocking his head slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like chocolate,\u201d Aizawa replies, and Hizashi\u2019s eyes widen a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you not like chocolate?\u201d he demands, aghast. Aizawa gives him a flat look in reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt tastes weird,\u201d Aizawa says, wrinkling his nose slightly in a way Hizashi can\u2019t help but find a little cute. \u201cToo sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi opens his mouth to reply, but before he can get the words out, someone says, \u201cSh\u014dta?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s shoulders stiffen minutely, his gaze fixed somewhere behind Hizashi. Curious, Hizashi glances over his shoulder, and is surprised to find Kayama making her way towards them. She smirks a little as her gaze lands on Hizashi, and something about it feels a little dangerous.</p>\n<p>\u201cKayama,\u201d Aizawa replies, and his tone sounds a little wary. Still, the casual familiarity makes an ugly feeling of jealousy coil in Hizashi\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend here?\u201d Kayama asks, coming to a stop in front of their table and giving Hizashi a careful onceover.</p>\n<p>\u201cYamada Hizashi,\u201d Hizashi replies, trying to plaster a polite smile on his face. \u201cUh, nice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYamada, huh?\u201d Kayama says, her smirk somehow getting wider. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to know that Sh\u014dta has some real friends and not just weirdos who accidentally text him. Take good care of him for me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Hizashi answers, feeling a little lost. Aizawa\u2019s cheeks look a little pink, and Hizashi wonders what he\u2019s missing here.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not actually your little brother,\u201d Aizawa grumbles, glaring up at Kayama.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not by blood,\u201d Kayama replies, leaning over to ruffle Aizawa\u2019s hair. \u201cBut spiritually you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d Aizawa huffs, batting Kayama\u2019s hand away and bristling a little, like an annoyed cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, well I have to meet with a girl about a thing,\u201d Kayama announces, ignoring Aizawa\u2019s complaint. \u201cBe safe, kids!\u201d</p>\n<p>She shoots them both a wink as she says it, and Hizashi feels his own cheeks heat as he wonders if she\u2019s implying what he thinks she is. Thankfully she saunters away before he can accidentally say anything incriminating, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about her,\u201d Aizawa sighs, making Hizashi look back over at him. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really understand boundaries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Hizashi replies, waving off Aizawa\u2019s concerns. \u201cShe seems cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa lets out a small, disbelieving snort at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what did she mean about weirdos accidentally texting you?\u201d Hizashi asks, curious.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few weeks ago, someone had a wrong number and ended up accidentally texting me,\u201d Aizawa answers, shrugging. \u201cWe talk occasionally. Kayama thinks they\u2019re a creepy old man trying to catfish me, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Hizashi thinks he heard wrong.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t thought about the similarities between his situation with Aizawa and Stranger Danger\u2019s situation with their crush, but he\u2019d assumed that that was just him being hopeful. This, though \u2013 this sounds like too much to be a coincidence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat does sound weird,\u201d Hizashi manages to choke out, trying to figure out what to say to determine if he really has gone off his rocker, or if Aizawa really <em>is</em> Stranger Danger. \u201cYou know what, I think someone just texted me \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>He digs his phone out of his pocket, trying to ignore the heavy thud of his heart in his chest as he feels Aizawa\u2019s curious gaze on him. With clumsy fingers, he types out, <em>so i think we might be sitting across from each other right now.</em></p>\n<p>Then, he hits send.</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s phone buzzes, but Hizashi keeps his eyes fixed on his own phone. Maybe it is just a coincidence, one <em>hell</em> of a \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cYamada,\u201d Aizawa says, his voice dangerously steady. \u201cIf this is some sort of joke, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a joke on anybody, I think it\u2019s probably on me,\u201d Hizashi replies weakly, finally looking up from his phone to meet Aizawa\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut hey, at least neither of us is an old creeper, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Aizawa \u2013</p>\n<p>Aizawa starts cracking up.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a soft snort of laughter, or even one of the short, sharp laughs of his that Hizashi covets. Instead, it starts as almost a giggle and then bubbles up and out of Aizawa\u2019s mouth until there are tears building at the corners of his eyes.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Hizashi doesn\u2019t know how to react, frozen and wide-eyed, but then he finds himself laughing too \u2013 laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation, because really, what <em>are</em> the chances? He\u2019s pretty sure that people at the other tables are staring at them, but he can\u2019t figure out how to stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Hizashi says once he finally manages to stop laughing, his chest heaving with the effort. \u201cI hear you have a crush on a guy who saved you from a situation similar to getting hit by a car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I hear you\u2019ve been pining for longer than I have,\u201d Aizawa snorts, an amused smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 you\u2019ve got me there,\u201d Hizashi replies, his cheeks turning a little pink. \u201cI can\u2019t believe \u2018loud\u2019 is the first thing that came to your mind when describing me, though. Seriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s accurate,\u201d Aizawa retorts, but his cheeks have gone a little pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Hizashi asks, a smirk spreading over his face. \u201cBecause you also said I was handsome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Kind of</em> handsome,\u201d Aizawa corrects, his cheeks turning even redder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still called me handsome,\u201d Hizashi points out, a warm feeling flooding his chest. \u201cAnd, uh, for the record, I think you are too. Handsome, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Aizawa mumbles, dipping his head forward a little so that his long hair obscures his brightly flushed face somewhat. It\u2019s kind of adorable.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Hizashi starts. \u201cIf I like you and you like me, can I call this a date?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa hesitates for a moment, but then says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to share my cake with you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d There\u2019s a small, teasing smile on his face, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d Hizashi announces, his face splitting into a wide grin.</p>\n<p>(Hizashi tries to steal a bite of cake, but unfortunately Aizawa protects it with a surprising viciousness. Hizashi\u2019s attempt to steal a kiss, on the other hand, is much more successful.)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fifteen Years Later</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, text Sh\u014dta for me and tell him we\u2019re running a little late,\u201d Hizashi says, taking a hand off the car\u2019s steering wheel to dig his phone out of his pocket, tossing it over to Thirteen, who\u2019s sitting in the passenger seat.</p>\n<p>Hizashi cruses the traffic and drums his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel as Thirteen scrolls through the phone\u2019s contacts list.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Mic-senpai,\u201d Thirteen says. \u201cI can\u2019t find Aizawa-senpai\u2019s number here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt should be under Stranger Danger,\u201d Hizashi replies, eyes still fixed on the road.</p>\n<p>\u201cStranger Danger?\u201d Thirteen asks, unable to entirely keep the surprise from their tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Hizashi says, a soft smile on his face.</p>"
