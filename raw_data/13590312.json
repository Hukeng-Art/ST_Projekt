  "notes": "<p>Honestly I have no excuse for this, basically it\u2019s a lot of smut with some plot and fluff thrown in there.</p>\n<p>Title comes from Fever by Peggy Lee.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://streetlightserenades.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tumblr</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/thestarsabove\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>\n</p>",
  "text": "<p>As a rule, Taehyung has never been particularly good at following directions. He doesn\u2019t do it on purpose - he just gets distracted, or forgets, or gets curious about what would happen if he takes a different approach. This has resulted in some funny outcomes, for example when he tried to give Yeontan a bath and accidentally turned him pink for a few days, and some less funny outcomes, ie when he tried to install a giant lava lamp in his room and ended up shorting the power to half the dorm. Luckily, none of these misadventures have had particularly serious consequences - that is, until The Saga that begins at the 2018 Golden Disc Awards.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, Taehyung acknowledges that the lady at the concession table probably did tell them that the purple fortune cookie was FOR SHOW ONLY, DO NOT EAT. At the time, though, taking this cookie seems like the obvious choice, mostly because it\u2019s purple, duh, and how often does one see a purple fortune cookie? For the record, it tastes really good, too, which is why he shovels the whole thing into his mouth before he even spares a glance at the fortune itself. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s longer than a usual fortune, written in scrawling purple font across a folded piece of white paper. It\u2019s also less generic than the fortunes Taehyung is accustomed to seeing, with messages about changes on the horizon or finding success in life. The paper reads:</p>\n<p>\n<em>Where there is love, there is warmth.<br>\nWhere there is honesty, there is relief.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Not one he\u2019s seen before, but he doesn\u2019t think much of it, going to toss the slip into the trash.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d A stern voice makes him freeze, and he looks up to see the concession table lady. \u201cDid you eat the purple cookie?\u201d she asks sharply. Her tone seems a little serious for a question about a fortune cookie, but maybe she\u2019s having a bad day.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm... yes?\u201d Taehyung says.</p>\n<p>The woman shakes her head, muttering something to herself about privileged boy band members. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to save that,\u201d she says, nodding at the fortune.</p>\n<p>Taehyung looks down at the crumpled piece of paper in his hand, confused. \u201c...why? Is it like, a special fortune?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d the woman replies. \u201cGood luck.\u201d And then she bustles off surprisingly quickly for a woman of her age.</p>\n<p>Taehyung blinks, not sure what to make of this encounter. Then he shrugs, slips the fortune into his back pocket, and gets distracted by Hoseok and Namjoon waving him over for a selfie.</p>\n<p>They win the Daesang, which is incredible and mind blowing and emotional, as it has been every time. As Taehyung stands in a shell-shocked huddle with the other members, their arms wrapped around each other, all he can think is how grateful he is, for their success but especially for these people. They\u2019ve been through so much together, and he can\u2019t imagine doing it without these 6 boys by his side. </p>\n<p>They go home that night, as they\u2019ll need to be up early for a full day of last minute promo and rehearsals for the 4th Muster tomorrow. As is often the case, Taehyung follows Jeongguk into whatever car he\u2019s shepherded into, and they curl up in the backseat, Taehyung dropping his head onto Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that feeling of winning will ever get old?\u201d he asks sleepily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Jeongguk replies through a yawn. \u201cI hope not, I never want to take it for granted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Taehyung hums in agreement, snuggling closer into Jeongguk\u2019s side. \u201cYou\u2019re so nice and warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk doesn\u2019t say anything in response, just absentmindedly runs his fingers through Taehyung\u2019s hair as they drive through the darkness. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Taehyung wakes up the next morning shivering so violently that he at first thinks he\u2019s somehow ended up outside. When he looks around and establishes that he is in fact in his room, in his bed, he stumbles over to the thermostat, wondering if the heat had cut out overnight. It reads 22 degrees Celsius, a perfectly normal indoor temperature, but he twists the dial up anyway before diving back into his bed and burrowing as far as he can under the blankets. None of this seems to help, and he\u2019s starting to get concerned that he\u2019s going to bite his own tongue off with how hard his teeth are chattering.</p>\n<p>He sticks a hand out from under the covers, feeling around for his phone until he locates it on his bedside table. With shaking fingers, he types out a message to the boys:</p>\n<p>&gt;sos am maybe dying pls come to my room&lt;</p>\n<p>No one responds immediately, but there\u2019s a soft knock on his door a few minutes later, and Jimin appears, his hair still sticking up from sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, drama qu- \u201c he begins, but then his focus actually settles on Taehyung, and he cuts himself off. \u201cShit, are you okay? You\u2019re shaking like a leaf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m f-freezing,\u201d Taehyung stutters out. His fingers feel numb, even where he has them tucked under his armpits. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, I just woke up feeling like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Jimin says, concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s like, a million degrees in here.\u201d He crosses the room to Taehyung\u2019s bed, pressing a hand to his forehead. His touch feels lukewarm, an improvement from Taehyung\u2019s current state but not by much. \u201cJesus Christ, your skin is ice cold.\u201d He looks genuinely worried now.</p>\n<p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Taehyung says weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get Seokjin hyung, hang on,\u201d Jimin tells him, hurrying out of the room. He reappears with Seokjin in tow a few minutes later. Seokjin takes one look at Taehyung and his mouth droops into a frown to match Jimin\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, you weren\u2019t kidding,\u201d he says once he\u2019s had a chance to feel Taehyung\u2019s skin for himself. \u201cI think we should ask management about calling a doctor, this is intense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we at least try to warm him up first?\u201d Jimin asks, lifting up the covers and sliding into bed next to Taehyung. He wraps his arms around his torso, hugging him close. \u201cDoes this help at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe a li-little,\u201d Taehyung says. He\u2019s starting to get freaked out himself - why is nothing helping?</p>\n<p>\u201cHis lips are literally blue, I\u2019m getting management,\u201d Seokjin declares, just as the door to Taehyung\u2019s room opens and a sleep-rumpled Jeongguk appears.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, looking between the three of them, his gaze snagging briefly on Jimin essentially spooning Taehyung in his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyungie is sick,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHis skin is freezing and he can\u2019t get warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s eyebrows shoot up in concern, and he walks over to the bed, pressing a tentative hand to Taehyung\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>The reaction is instantaneous. Warmth, glorious warmth, shoots through Taehyung\u2019s body as if emanating from the place where Jeongguk had touched him. Taehyung flinches hard in surprise, gasping, and Jeongguk pulls back sharply, looking embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says hurriedly, backing away like a kicked puppy. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung says, shaking his head and reaching out for him. \u201cNo, wait, do that again, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all stare at him, but Jeongguk complies, inching forward until his knuckles brush against Taehyung\u2019s cheek again. Taehyung sighs in relief, the same warmth seeping through his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so warm,\u201d he explains. Jeongguk looks down at him with wide, searching eyes, but he doesn\u2019t move his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, warmer than Jimin?\u201d Seokjin asks, pressing a hand to both Jeongguk and Jimin. \u201cThey feel the same to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cJeonggukie feels warmer. Like, really warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk, switch places with Jimin,\u201d Seokjin instructs, his forehead knit with confusion. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s eyes get even wider. \u201cI - \u201d he stammers, but Seokjin shushes him.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuickly, it seems like the only thing that will help right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk shuts his mouth and nods, slipping under the covers as Jimin scrambles out to make room for him. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Taehyung whimpers, burrowing against him immediately. Jeongguk feels like a giant heater, a welcome respite to the brutal cold wracking his body. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs that better?\u201d Jeongguk asks, eyes soft with concern. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo much better, thank you,\u201d Taehyung replies. Jeongguk wraps his arms around him, hooking his chin over Taehyung\u2019s shoulder, and Taehyung sighs contentedly.</p>\n<p>Seokjin and Jimin are both staring at them now, completely bemused. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not shaking anymore,\u201d Jimin points out. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is bizarre,\u201d Seokjin says. \u201cLet\u2019s get the other boys and see if they\u2019re feeling okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so Namjoon, Yoongi, and Hoseok are summoned, filtering into the room in various states of alertness given that it\u2019s hardly 7am. They all feel fine, but none of them have the same effect on Taehyung as Jeongguk - they all feel lukewarm, like Jimin had. </p>\n<p>\u201cI still feel like we should call a doctor,\u201d Seokjin says, and Namjoon nods in agreement. \u201cI\u2019m glad Jeongguk is helping, but this is definitely not normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to think I\u2019m on some sort of weird drug trip,\u201d Taehyung protests.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Are</em> you on some sort of weird drug trip?!\u201d Jimin asks, alarmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Taehyung replies, indignant. \u201cYou know I would never, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we should give it a day,\u201d Namjoon says practically. \u201cIt could just be a weird bug, or something, and maybe Jeongguk just gives off extra body heat. Taehyung seems okay now.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is true - with Jeongguk wrapped snugly around him, Taehyung feels mostly fine. Still a little chillier than usual, maybe, but nothing unbearable.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can stay with you for the day, just in case,\u201d Jeongguk offers, and Taehyung squeezes his hand in thanks. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay...\u201d Seokjin says reluctantly. \u201cBut if gets bad again, I\u2019m telling management.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of the boys disperse to get ready for the day\u2019s activities - they have to do some last minute promo shots for the Muster, and then they have choreography rehearsals all afternoon. The photo shoot won\u2019t start until later in the morning, so Taehyung and Jeongguk are left alone for a few hours to explore the nuances of their new... situation.</p>\n<p>They discover that, if Jeongguk touches him for long enough, the residual warmth seems to stay with Taehyung, and he can be okay on his own for a little while. It also becomes apparent that the more of their bodies that are touching, the more it helps, and bare skin seems to be especially effective (although they skirt neatly right around the implications of that). </p>\n<p>This last discovery comes when they\u2019ve ventured to Jeongguk\u2019s room and broken apart temporarily so that he can get dressed. Taehyung starts shivering again while Jeongguk is standing in front of his closet, still shirtless as he ponders aloud about what to wear. </p>\n<p>\u201cShould I wear my red sweatshirt or the graphic one?\u201d he asks. \u201cOr wait, there\u2019s the gray one from Topman - oh, fuck, you\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Taehyung says as Jeongguk hurries over and wraps his arms around him. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk has worked a lot on getting stronger in the past year, and the change in his body is not lost on Taehyung, no matter how much he tries not to focus on it (he fears his head might explode if he does). He\u2019s always been toned, but he has muscles now, sculpted arms and a set of abs that Taehyung tells himself would make any normal human take a second look. It would be more distracting to have said muscled arms and chest pressed against him right now were it not for the huge rush of heat that hits him as soon as they touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re even warmer without a shirt on,\u201d Taehyung hums appreciatively, burrowing into him. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk coughs. \u201cOh, really? I guess that makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. I like the red sweatshirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk tows him over to the closet, keeping one arm around his waist and only removing it when he pulls a T-shirt and the sweatshirt over his head. Taehyung tries not to whine audibly at the loss of his direct body heat. On the bright side, at least now he has a valid, not creepy excuse for wanting Jeongguk to be shirtless all the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is really weird,\u201d Jeongguk observes, hopping around on one foot to get his shoes on since one of his hands is linked with Taehyung\u2019s. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m like, supernaturally warm or something?\u201d He pauses, his face lighting up with excitement. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a werewolf!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that make me a vampire?\u201d Taehyung asks, making a face. \u201cI\u2019m not craving blood. Although I could go for some lunch soon, are they ordering food for the photo shoot?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk shrugs, assessing himself in the mirror. When did his jaw line get so defined, Taehyung wonders? It seems like just a few minutes ago he was just a baby faced teenager - when did he become this man who Taehyung is, regrettably, finding himself more and more attracted to?</p>\n<p>He and Jeongguk have been close pretty much since the beginning, although it had taken a little while for Taehyung to wear through his shyness and general aversion to being touched at first. But soon enough it became clear that they actually had a lot in common, and a special bond developed between them. Taehyung feels extremely close to all six members - they\u2019re a family by now - but it\u2019s no secret that Jeongguk is his number one, and vice versa. It\u2019s never amounted to anything more than a very deep friendship though, and Taehyung has accepted that, even though he would be lying if he said the thought had never crossed his mind. They\u2019ve had their close calls, moments when it felt like things were tipping into uncharted territory, but nothing ever came of it. It\u2019s better this way, Taehyung has convinced himself - easier, neater. He just wishes Jeongguk would stop getting hotter (no pun intended) seemingly with each passing second, because even though his mind is practical, his body certainly is not.</p>\n<p>The promo shots are being done in-house, so Jeongguk gives him a piggy back to the studio where they\u2019ve been told to meet. It ends up not mattering which sweatshirt Jeongguk picked, because the stylists adjust their outfits anyway, switching out certain items and fussing with their hair. It\u2019s a testament to how touchy Taehyung is to begin with that no one bats an eye at him following Jeongguk around all day, clinging to him at every chance he gets. He can feel the boys watching him more closely than usual, especially Seokjin and Jimin, but they seem somewhat appeased once they see Taehyung acting like his usual self. </p>\n<p>The choreography rehearsals go smoothly as well, and the exercise seems to help a little, which is reassuring. Taehyung sticks close to Jeongguk just in case, linking their arms together or latching on to him from behind whenever he starts to feel cold again. He feels sort of like an addict, taking hits of Jeongguk to keep himself feeling normal, but it works like a charm every time. All he knows is that he\u2019s grateful that Jeongguk\u2019s super human body heat seems to be the antidote to this weird reverse fever situation he has going on, because he would probably be freaking out a lot harder if he wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The 7 of them eat dinner together, Jeongguk\u2019s thigh pressed up against Taehyung\u2019s under the table, and then retreat to their various rooms for an early bedtime, knowing that tomorrow will be hectic and exhausting with the first night of the Muster.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, umm,\u201d Jeongguk says awkwardly when they get to Taehyung\u2019s door. \u201cI guess... we should probably sleep together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung quirks an eyebrow at him. \u201cJeonggukie, so forward!\u201d he teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Jeongguk groans, turning red. \u201cYou know what I mean, like share a bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Taehyung nods. \u201cWould be bad if I turned into an icicle the night before the Muster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery,\u201d Jeongguk agrees. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m just gonna go change, I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung slips into his own pajamas while he waits, wondering why he suddenly feels so nervous. He and Jeongguk have shared a bed plenty of times before, especially when they were younger and less famous and the hotels they stayed in weren\u2019t as nice. There\u2019s just something weird about making the conscious decision to do so, and the fact that they\u2019re definitely going to have to cuddle if Taehyung is going to make it through the night.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk returns not long after, dressed in black sweats and a white T-shirt, and effectively cuts off Taehyung\u2019s unexpected nerve spiral. They climb into Taehyung\u2019s bed (as they\u2019ve done many times before, he reminds himself), and Jeongguk hugs him close. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for being such a good sport about this,\u201d Taehyung murmurs against his chest. \u201cI know it seems really crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Jeongguk replies. \u201cI just am glad I can help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Taehyung yawns. \u201cHopefully this was just some weird fluke and everything is back to normal tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, hopefully,\u201d Jeongguk echoes. Something in his voice sounds a little off, but Taehyung falls asleep before he can put his finger on what.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Jeongguk wakes up in the middle of the night to find that he and Taehyung have rolled apart. Taehyung still seems to be asleep, but he\u2019s shivering, and when Jeongguk reaches over to touch him, his skin is disconcertingly cold. Alarmed, he tugs off his own shirt and pulls Taehyung back to him, remembering what Taehyung had said about him being extra warm when he was shirtless. Not that Jeongguk has been reading too much into that, or anything. </p>\n<p>So this explains why, when he wakes up again the next morning, Taehyung blinks at him curiously and says: \u201cWhen did you get naked?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not <em>naked</em>,\u201d Jeongguk squawks, panicking for a second until he confirms that he is in fact still wearing his sweatpants.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, fine, shirtless,\u201d Taehyung replies, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI woke up in the middle of the night and you were freezing,\u201d Jeongguk explains, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and yawning. He could get used to waking up next to Taehyung. \u201cSo I thought the extra body heat would help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Taehyung says, his eyes soft. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk shrugs, swallowing. All of this extra proximity to Taehyung is making it even more difficult than usual for him to act normal (read: like he doesn\u2019t have a hopeless crush on his best friend). \u201cHow are you feeling this morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel fine now,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t really been apart from you, so I can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk pointedly ignores the familiar fluttering in his stomach, stretching his arms over his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go get dressed, then. Come over if you start getting cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Privately, he\u2019s kind of glad when there\u2019s a knock at his door thirty minutes later, and he opens it to find Taehyung standing in the hallway, hugging himself. This definitely makes him a horrible person, 100%, but selfishly he likes having an excuse to touch Taehyung all the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot better, then?\u201d he says, opening his arms. Taehyung huddles against him immediately. He doesn\u2019t feel as cold as he had last night, but the chill still seeps through the fabric of Jeongguk\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d</p>\n<p>They break the news to the other boys at breakfast, and predictably they immediately say it\u2019s time to call a doctor. Jeongguk thinks they have a point, considering this is highly worrisome and definitely not normal, even if selfishly he\u2019s not in a huge rush to get it figured out.</p>\n<p>Taehyung waves them off. \u201cGuys, I\u2019m fine. There\u2019s no time for me to see a doctor anyway, the Muster starts tonight!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are definitely not fine if you start turning into an ice cube every time you\u2019re away from Jeongguk for too long!\u201d Seokjin argues.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll stay close to him,\u201d Taehyung retorts, looping his arm through Jeongguk\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cForever?\u201d Jimin says dubiously, and Jeongguk\u2019s stomach does a backflip.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s just get through the Muster, okay?\u201d Taehyung pleads. \u201cThen we can figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seokjin opens his mouth, but Namjoon pats him on the shoulder reassuringly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be together the whole time. As long as Jeongguk-ah is there, he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d They all turn to look at Jeongguk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, of course, I\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he says firmly, without hesitation, and Taehyung flashes him a grateful smile. </p>\n<p>The thing is, Jeongguk will always be there if Taehyung needs him, even if it hurts, even if it means setting his own feelings aside sometimes. Taehyung is a rare kind of friend, someone who really sees him for who he is and who has been by his side through so much - good and bad. There is a part of Jeongguk that wants and has always wanted more, but he\u2019d decided a long time ago that their friendship was the most important, that as long as he could keep Taehyung in his life, that would be enough. It\u2019s not enough, not really, but he\u2019ll take what he can get - Taehyung is worth it.</p>\n<p>The day passes in a blur of last minute fittings, hair and makeup, and dress rehearsals. They\u2019re debuting some new choreography tonight, which Jeongguk is excited about - the fans are going to go wild, and it\u2019s always nice to add some variety to their performances. Taehyung hovers close to him while they\u2019re getting ready, so much so that the makeup noonas admonish him because he keeps making Jeongguk laugh. In the end, he settles on the floor in front of Jeongguk\u2019s chair, sitting with his back against Jeongguk\u2019s legs while he fiddles with his phone. </p>\n<p>The first night of the Muster is just as much of a success as they had hoped. The ARMYs are as happy and responsive as ever, eating up the skits and the new choreo. They also are used to the seven of them being touchy onstage, so it\u2019s relatively easy to find opportunities to grab ahold of Taehyung and make sure he\u2019s sufficiently warm. They\u2019re all skilled enough at being in front of a crowd by now to pass it off as just a regular part of the show, even if Jeongguk\u2019s touches linger a little longer than they usually would. For strictly scientific reasons, of course.</p>\n<p>He and Taehyung share a car back to the dorms with Hoseok, who shoots an appraising look at where they\u2019re cuddled together in the backseat and says: \u201cAren\u2019t you two cute.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jeongguk fights to keep his expression neutral, but Taehyung beams, squeezing him tighter. \u201cMy personal space heater.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back at the dorms, they all disperse, congratulating each other on a good show as they traipse off to their respective rooms. Taehyung turns to Jeongguk, yawning, and says casually: \u201cWanna sleep in your bed tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Something about the way he says it knocks the wind out of Jeongguk - so easy, so natural, as if they\u2019re a couple that actually does share a bed every night. Not just two friends, one of whom happens to have a body temperature regulation issue that can apparently only be moderated by the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jeongguk says, trying not to stutter. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYay, I like that fuzzy blanket you have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean the one that you always steal and is currently in your bedroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung blinks at him. \u201cRight, so I\u2019ll bring that over once I\u2019m done getting changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk chuckles, shaking his head as he heads to his own room to change into pajamas. He debates foregoing a shirt, especially considering what had happened last night, but ends up chickening out and pulling a T-shirt on at the last second. It feels a little too close to actually dating territory to start the night without a shirt on, even if there is a legitimate reason for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDecided to keep your clothes on tonight, I see,\u201d Taehyung teases, waltzing into Jeongguk\u2019s room without knocking. You\u2019d think he would have learned not to do that by now, after all the times they\u2019ve accidentally caught each other in compromising positions, but Taehyung has never been great with boundaries.</p>\n<p>\u201cDisappointed?\u201d Jeongguk fires back cheekily, trying not to blush. He wishes.</p>\n<p>Taehyung raises his eyebrows in surprise, always delighted when Jeongguk sasses him back. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he tosses back with a cheeky wink, and Jeongguk has to disguise the choking sound he makes as a cough. Taehyung looks at him curiously. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, I took my shirt off last night to keep you from freezing to death, you ungrateful ass,\u201d Jeongguk says when he stops coughing. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Taehyung concedes, shuffling over and hugging him. He has Jeongguk\u2019s blanket draped around his shoulders like a cape. \u201cYou\u2019re the best friend ever, I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk grumbles but hugs him back anyway - he\u2019s powerless, really, when it comes to Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you think tonight went?\u201d Taehyung asks, releasing Jeongguk in favor of crawling into his bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I think,\u201d Jeongguk says, following him. \u201cIt was fun to get to perform Best of Me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I like that choreography.\u201d He snuggles up close to Jeongguk, pressing his toes against his calf. </p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, your toes are freezing,\u201d Jeongguk yelps, jerking away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well, whose fault is that?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jeongguk glowers at him incredulously. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018oh Jeongguk, I don\u2019t deserve you?\u2019 You\u2019re all talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Taehyung says, properly chastised. He tips his forehead forward until it rests on Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI meant it though, I really don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is soft, and Jeongguk\u2019s heart stutters in his chest. He doesn\u2019t know what to say in response, but luckily Taehyung saves him from having to think of something. Always rescuing him from feeling awkward. </p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously though, will you warm up my toes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d Jeongguk groans, flinching when he feels Taehyung\u2019s icy feet against his calf again. He doesn\u2019t mind, though, not really - not if it means he gets to fall asleep to the sound of Taehyung breathing gently beside him. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>On the third morning of The Saga, Taehyung wakes up at a pleasant temperature, tucked into the side of a sleeping Jeongguk. He\u2019s mildly disappointed to find that Jeongguk is still wearing a shirt this morning, but he dismisses that thought quickly, internally scolding himself for being such a creeper. </p>\n<p>Never one to last very long without some form of attention, he fidgets and shifts at Jeongguk\u2019s side, hoping the movement will \u201caccidentally\u201d wake him up. When this is unsuccessful (not surprising, considering Jeongguk sleeps like the dead and usually requires a minimum of 30 minutes to turn into a functional, responsive human being), Taehyung resorts to more direct tactics, such as repeatedly prodding his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmf,\u201d Jeongguk grunts eventually, stirring. \u201cWha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, sunshine,\u201d Taehyung greets cheerily, squishing his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk cracks one eye open, looking startled for a moment when he sees Taehyung next to him in bed. Then the pieces seem to fall into place, and he says: \u201cI see you didn\u2019t turn into an ice cube overnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuzzah,\u201d Taehyung replies, pressing his hands together as if in prayer. \u201cAll thanks to you, Jeonggukie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Taehyung announces as Jeongguk\u2019s eyes drift shut again. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s cake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s 8am,\u201d Jeongguk says without opening his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to investigate, I\u2019ll bring some back if I find it.\u201d </p>\n<p>He crawls out of bed, merrily ignoring Jeongguk\u2019s mumbled response of \u201cdiet,\u201d and sets off for the kitchen. Once there, he finds Jimin, still in his pajamas, staring blankly at the contents of the refrigerator.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Jiminie,\u201d Taehyung says, and Jimin nods at him. \u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to decide what I want for breakfast,\u201d he replies sleepily. His expression shifts to alarm. \u201cWait a minute, where\u2019s Jeongguk? Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I just left him in bed,\u201d Taehyung explains, waving him off, even though he does feel a bit cooler than he had a few minutes ago. \u201cI came in search of cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks at him but doesn\u2019t question this, which Taehyung views as a testament to how well they\u2019ve gotten to know each other over the years.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Look, there is some left over,\u201d Taehyung cries happily, lightly hip checking Jimin to the side and reaching into the refrigerator. There had been a small birthday celebration for one of their crew members in the dorm the other day, and the remnants of the cake had ended up in their kitchen. \u201cWant some?\u201d he asks, turning to Jimin.</p>\n<p>Jimin wrinkles his nose. \u201cI\u2019m just going to have some fruit... since it\u2019s the morning...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Taehyung shrugs, grabbing two forks out of the drawer. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Jeongguk still hasn\u2019t moved by the time Taehyung makes it back to his room. The only natural response, obviously, is for Taehyung to climb on top of him and sit cross legged across his thighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, get <em>off</em>,\u201d Jeongguk groans, batting at him weakly.</p>\n<p>Taehyung bounces slightly instead. \u201cI have cake!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Jeongguk replies, opening his eyes so that he can glare at Taehyung.</p>\n<p>Taehyung spears a bite of cake on a fork and shoves it in Jeongguk\u2019s face, grinning. </p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m on a d - \u201d he cuts off when Taehyung stuffs the cake into his open mouth. \u201cI literally hate you,\u201d he says once he finishes swallowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good though, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of responding, Jeongguk jerks his legs up, sending Taehyung sprawling to the side. Luckily, he manages to save the cake from toppling on to Jeongguk\u2019s bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cRude,\u201d Taehyung pouts. \u201cNow I\u2019m not going to share with you anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk lunges at him, his mouth closing around the bite of cake that Taehyung now has on his fork. Taehyung squeals indignantly, wriggling away, but somehow they end up face to face, Jeongguk hovering over him with one hand on either side of his head. It shouldn\u2019t be weird, considering they rough house all the time and literally just spent the night in the same bed, but suddenly Taehyung\u2019s breath is catching in his throat. Their eyes lock for just a moment too long, long enough for Taehyung to wonder - what if? - before Jeongguk is rolling away, a faint blush on his cheeks. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jeongguk mutters, but Taehyung lies still for another moment, trying to process what had just happened and how Jeongguk is reacting to it now. He snaps back to reality when he registers that Jeongguk seems to be genuinely uncomfortable, which is pretty much Taehyung\u2019s least favorite thing ever. </p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you wanted the cake,\u201d he says haughtily, sitting up and poking Jeongguk\u2019s side. Jeongguk looks at him sideways, his lips twitching into a small smile. \u201cLucky for you, I brought plenty to share.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of the day passes without incident, so chaotic that Taehyung hardly has time to think about what had happened between him and Jeongguk that morning. Before he knows it, they\u2019re back onstage for the second night of the Muster, which conveniently includes a skit that requires him and Jeongguk to butt-check each other across the stage. It\u2019s an odd sensation, to say the least, to feel a rush of heat in his butt every time Jeongguk bumps against him. That being said, Jeongguk has a really nice ass, so Taehyung isn\u2019t complaining, even when the last round of the competition sends him sprawling to the ground. When he looks up, Jeongguk is watching him over his shoulder, smiling shyly, cheekily, and Taehyung feels a rush of something other than heat in his stomach. </p>\n<p>Everything is going fine until, through some mix-up with their staff, Jeongguk gets held up while they\u2019re exiting the venue. Not wanting to be a diva, Taehyung climbs into a car with Namjoon, Yoongi, and Jimin instead, shrugging Jimin off when he questions whether it\u2019s a good idea for Taehyung to be apart from Jeongguk. It\u2019s a short ride back to the dorm, he\u2019ll be fine. That is, until they hit traffic.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been some sort of accident ahead of them, causing a huge backup that slows their progress considerably. Anxiety twists uncomfortably in Taehyung\u2019s stomach, but he tells himself to breathe, ignoring the worried looks the other boys cast at him. It\u2019s no use, though - thirty minutes into the ride, they\u2019ve still barely moved, and Taehyung has started shivering in earnest. Jimin huddles close to him, warming him the best he can, and Yoongi crawls into the backseat and curls around him from the other side. In the middle seat, Namjoon calls Seokjin, trying to figure out how close the other car is - they\u2019d gone a different way but are also caught in the traffic.</p>\n<p>In the end, it\u2019s Namjoon who convinces their driver to make an illegal turn on to a side road, keeping his voice surprisingly calm as he explains that Taehyung is ill and needs to get home immediately. They arrive back at the dorm fifteen minutes later, but by that point Taehyung is shaking so hard he can\u2019t even hold himself upright. His whole body feels sluggish, numb, as his bandmates support him into the building and up the elevator back to the dorm.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re there, there\u2019s nothing to do but wait - Taehyung sits slumped on the couch in the living area, Jimin and Yoongi holding him tightly, matching panicked expressions on their faces. Namjoon paces back and forth in front of them, speaking frantically into his phone, presumably to Seokjin. Taehyung has rarely seen him this freaked out before, and it makes the fear spike in his own hazy brain. Everything is cold, so cold, and he feels like he might be teetering on the edge of blacking out. The only thing that\u2019s clear in his mind is Jeongguk - he needs Jeongguk.</p>\n<p>As if on cue, the front door bangs open and Jeongguk tumbles into the dorm, Seokjin and Hoseok hot on his heels. His expression is tortured, terrified, and his eyes go wide in horror when they land on Taehyung. Even through the numbness that\u2019s closing in on him, Taehyung\u2019s heart gives a thump of approval when he registers Jeongguk\u2019s presence. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk makes a beeline across the room, ripping off his jacket and flinging himself on top of Taehyung, one leg on either side of his waist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers over and over again, his voice pained. \u201cJesus Christ, Taehyung, are you okay?\u201d His hands come up to frame Taehyung\u2019s face, thumb brushing over his cheek. </p>\n<p>Taehyung wants to respond that yes, he is okay, because now Jeongguk is here and there is warmth slowly seeping back into his frigid bones. But the words don\u2019t quite reach his frozen lips, and Jeongguk is still searching his face with worried eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, holy fuck,\u201d Jeongguk says, and then he\u2019s leaning in, pressing his hot mouth to Taehyung\u2019s. The heat sparks through Taehyung\u2019s body like a flame, and he gasps so hard he starts coughing, clutching at Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that for,\u201d he croaks, the feeling gradually returning to his fingers and toes. The other boys are still huddled around them, watching closely, but Taehyung is only vaguely aware of their presence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour lips were blue,\u201d Jeongguk whispers, leaning his forehead against Taehyung\u2019s. Taehyung loops his arms around his neck and hugs him tightly.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It takes a while, but eventually the other members concede that Taehyung seems well enough to make it through the night. After an hour tucked into Jeongguk\u2019s side - and that kiss, god - he\u2019s nearly back to normal, apologizing to everyone for scaring them (because Taehyung <em>would</em> almost die and then apologize for it) but assuring them that he feels fine now. They drop off one by one, Namjoon the last to go when Jeongguk swears he won\u2019t leave Taehyung\u2019s side for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk and Taehyung walk to Taehyung\u2019s room in silence, arm in arm, but Jeongguk\u2019s mind is racing. Now that the chaos from earlier has died down - he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been so scared in his life - he can\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that he had <em>kissed</em> Taehyung. And in front of the entire band, no less. It had made sense at the time, what with the fact that Taehyung\u2019s lips were literally blue, but still. Fuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Taehyung asks when the door to his room closes behind them. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe <em>you\u2019re</em> asking <em>me</em> that,\u201d Jeongguk says, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>Taehyung shrugs. \u201cI know it was scary for you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it had been - Jeongguk doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever forget the way Taehyung had looked when he\u2019d arrived in the dorm, small and practically lifeless on the couch. And it had been all his fault.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Jeongguk says, looking down as his voice cracks. He\u2019ll never forgive himself for leaving Taehyung alone for so long. \u201cI should have been in the car with you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it, this isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Taehyung says sharply, nudging Jeongguk\u2019s chin up so that their eyes meet. \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m fine. You made me better.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jeongguk blinks rapidly, his eyes suddenly stinging with unshed tears. God, this is embarrassing.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk-ah, come on,\u201d Taehyung murmurs, squeezing his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk nods, and they get ready for bed, Jeongguk borrowing a T-shirt and sweats from Taehyung because he refuses to leave him alone for even a minute. When they\u2019re settled in, lying face to face under the covers with their legs intertwined, Taehyung says:</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeongguk replies, nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou kissed me, before.\u201d He looks at Jeongguk through those gorgeous, soulful eyes and Jeongguk feels his breath stutter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI - yeah,\u201d he says awkwardly, hating that he can feel his face heating up. \u201cSorry, I just was so freaked out, I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Taehyung says, shaking his head. \u201cI actually, was wondering if, now that the others aren\u2019t around - you would do it again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s eyes go wide, and if he wasn\u2019t blushing before, he certainly is now. His brain is having trouble processing what\u2019s happening - Taehyung, <em>Kim Taehyung</em>, best friend, bandmate, and primary romantic fixation of the past 5 years of his life, is asking Jeongguk to kiss him. He\u2019s fantasized about this moment so many times that a part of him doesn\u2019t even believe it\u2019s truly happening. </p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d he stammers, fighting to hear himself over the chaos unfolding in his mind. Taehyung is watching him curiously, almost hesitantly, as if he thinks Jeongguk might say no. Ha. \u201cYeah, I mean, of course - did it help, before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Because that\u2019s the only plausible scenario here - something about Jeongguk clearly helps Taehyung feel better, and it seems like kissing is just another part of that. A shudder runs through his body when he considers what other types of activities that might extend to, but he promptly squashes that thought. No need to make more of a fool of himself with Taehyung than he already has.</p>\n<p>Something indecipherable flickers across Taehyung\u2019s face, but then he\u2019s nodding, shifting slightly closer to Jeongguk. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t really know how to describe it, but it was more than when we just touch, you know?\u201d He bites his lip, and Jeongguk can\u2019t help it when his own gaze lingers there for just a moment too long. \u201cI felt... warm from the inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Funnily enough, that\u2019s exactly how Jeongguk would describe how he feels when he\u2019s around Taehyung, but he\u2019s not about to share that piece of information right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeongguk nods, a sort of elated nervousness rising in his stomach. He gets to kiss Taehyung again. \u201cThen, um, I\u2019ll just...\u201d</p>\n<p>He trails off, his mouth dropping open when Taehyung circles his wrist and guides his hand up to cup his cheek. Jeongguk\u2019s heart is hammering in his chest, his breathing erratic as he leans in, closing the distance between them and kissing Taehyung for the second time that night. </p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s lips are warm against his this time, soft as they part to kiss him back. He makes a happy sort of noise in the back of his throat, and Jeongguk wonders what this feels like for him, if it feels as good - or maybe even better? - as it does for Jeongguk. At the very least, he seems to be enjoying himself, pressing closer to Jeongguk and wrapping his hand around the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little alarming how easily Jeongguk lets himself slip under, whimpering slightly when Taehyung\u2019s tongue slips into his mouth. His fingers slide along Taehyung\u2019s jaw, angling his face so as to kiss him more deeply, and it\u2019s all he can do not to roll on top of him and cover Taehyung with his whole body. For now, he\u2019ll settle for tangling his fingers in the soft hair at the base of Taehyung\u2019s neck, shivering with every noise Taehyung makes.</p>\n<p>When they finally break apart, Jeongguk\u2019s head is spinning, and he feels like the whole world probably could have collapsed around them without him noticing. Taehyung is smiling at him shyly, his lips kissed pink, and Jeongguk nearly has an aneurysm when it registers that he\u2019s the one responsible for that.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Taehyung hums. \u201cThat felt really nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk might have picked something more along the lines of mind blowing or life altering, but nice works too. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, a little breathlessly. \u201cYeah, good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung giggles, his teeth catching on his lower lip again, and wow, Jeongguk really needs him to stop doing that.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight, Jeonggukie,\u201d Taehyung says, shutting his eyes and draping an arm over Jeongguk\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight,\u201d he replies. He switches off the light on his bedside table, but he stays awake for a long time after that.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When Taehyung awakes the next morning, Jeongguk is, not surprisingly, still asleep beside him. Taehyung yawns, snuggling into the heat that seems to radiate from his chest, and pokes him in the stomach. </p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk-ah,\u201d he murmurs.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk grunts, which is actually more of a response than Taehyung had been expecting. </p>\n<p>\u201cWake up.\u201d He pokes Jeongguk in the stomach again, eliciting a rather endearing noise of discontent as he squirms away.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguuuuk,\u201d he whines. And then, without really thinking about it, he says: \u201cMorning kiss?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wait, what?</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s eyes fly open just as Taehyung covers his own with his hands, embarrassed. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, peeking out from between his fingers. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes are almost comically wide. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t just demand kisses from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no denying that his body seems to crave it now - the extra boost of warmth that comes when Jeongguk\u2019s lips are on his. This is a problem, Taehyung thinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you,\u201d Jeongguk says, his voice raspy with sleep. He reaches out and grabs Taehyung\u2019s hand, pulling it away from his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask, Tae.\u201d</p>\n<p>His face is so soft that Taehyung\u2019s heart melts a little - his sweet, lovely Jeongguk. He\u2019s known him since they were both practically kids, and now here he is, this man who has been so selfless in taking care of Taehyung. It creates an ache in Taehyung\u2019s chest that he\u2019s not sure how to deal with it, but more kissing seems like a good short-term solution.</p>\n<p>Taehyung is the one who leans in this time, kissing Jeongguk gently. That telltale heat rushes through him again, and it feels so good that he doesn\u2019t even care if they both have a little bit of morning breath. He just wants to be closer to Jeongguk, to feel him everywhere.</p>\n<p>In pursuit of this goal, he lets his hand drift down from Jeongguk\u2019s face, skimming over the (really well defined, Jesus) muscles in his arm. Jeongguk hums appreciatively, pressing closer, his tongue tracing along Taehyung\u2019s lower lip. His hand finds Taehyung\u2019s waist under the covers, settling on the bare skin where his T-shirt has ridden up, and the heat is so overwhelming that Taehyung gasps, his whole body jolting. Jeongguk pulls away immediately, looking guilty, but Taehyung presses his palm over his mouth before he can apologize. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he says, surprised at how hoarse his own voice sounds. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes are dark where they\u2019re watching Taehyung over his own hand. \u201cThat was a good reaction, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he pulls his hand away, Jeongguk is gaping at him, and a different kind of heat twists in Taehyung\u2019s stomach. They surge back together at the same time, and Jeongguk\u2019s hand finds its way back to his hip, the tip of his thumb slipping ever so slightly under the fabric of Taehyung\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud knock at the door, and they spring apart so violently that Jeongguk almost falls off the bed. Taehyung grabs his arm to steady him as a voice from outside shouts \u201cINCOMING!\u201d and the door swings open.</p>\n<p>Taehyung sits up as all five of the other members pile into his room, doing his best to look like he hadn\u2019t just been making out with his best friend thirty seconds ago. Beside him, Jeongguk still looks shell-shocked, his hair mussed from, oops, Taehyung\u2019s hands. Taehyung shivers a little, pointedly ignoring the suspicious look that Jimin casts at him as he glances back and forth between the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Taehyung greets as the boys drop into various sitting positions around his room. They all look concerned, and Taehyung can\u2019t really blame them. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you feeling, Tae?\u201d Namjoon asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m great,\u201d he says honestly. \u201cJeongguk has been taking good care of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk makes an odd sort of choking noise next to him, and Taehyung pats him on the back as Jimin\u2019s eyebrows shoot right up to his hairline. Yoongi is also watching them with a slightly perplexed expression on his face, like he can\u2019t quite figure out what\u2019s going on between them but isn\u2019t sure if he wants to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad,\u201d Namjoon says, either oblivious to the tension in the room or choosing to ignore it. \u201cBut we need to get serious about this. The Muster is over, and last night was way too close for comfort. I really thought - \u201d he clears his throat, the features of his face wobbling. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you were going to make it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other boys all nod, frowning, and Taehyung is seized by guilt for having put them through that. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Namjoon says. \u201cWe just need to figure out what the hell is happening to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we <em>please</em> call a doctor now?\u201d Seokjin interjects.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is a doctor going to tell me?\u201d Taehyung asks. He understands their concern, feels it too, but something is telling him that a regular doctor isn\u2019t going to be able to help. \u201cHave any of you ever heard of a disease like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence, and Taehyung can tell they see his point, even if they\u2019re not happy about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s think about this,\u201d Hoseok says, leaning forward so that his elbows rest on his knees. \u201cWhen did this all start? The morning after Golden Disc?\u201d Taehyung nods. \u201cSo, did anything weird happen to you that night? Anything at all that could have caused this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung frowns, considering. Nothing in particular jumps out at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get bitten by a radioactive spider, or anything like that?\u201d Yoongi asks. Taehyung\u2019s eyes go wide, and he hurriedly tacks on: \u201cRelax, I was joking.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Taehyung has suddenly remembered one slightly unusual thing about the second night of the Golden Disc Awards - the purple fortune cookie, and the fortune inside of it. The words of the woman at the concession stand echo in his head: </p>\n<p>\n<em>You\u2019re going to want to save that.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Oh god.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d he breathes.</p>\n<p>The boys all stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi prompts him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to believe me,\u201d Taehyung says, mind racing. \u201cBut - there were purple fortune cookies, in the concession area.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ones that said DO NOT EAT?\u201d Namjoon asks, sighing like he already knows where this is going.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, those,\u201d he says, nodding sheepishly. \u201cWell, I ate one - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d Seokjin admonishes, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Taehyung says, waving him off. \u201cBut I did, and the woman at the concession stand yelled at me, telling me I better save the fortune. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time, but...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not seriously suggesting that this is happening to you because of a fortune cookie,\u201d Hoseok says, deadpan.</p>\n<p>Taehyung shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did the fortune say?\u201d Jeongguk asks, speaking up for the first time since the other members had arrived. </p>\n<p>Taehyung blanches. He remembers exactly what the fortune had said, but he\u2019s not sure he wants to share it with the whole room right now. </p>\n<p>\n<em>Where there is love, there is warmth.\nWhere there is honesty, there is relief.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yeah, he\u2019s going to need a little time to think that one over, especially the \u201clove\u201d part. His stomach twists uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm,\u201d he deflects. \u201cSomething about, finding warmth where there\u2019s... a strong connection.\u201d </p>\n<p>That\u2019s close enough, right?</p>\n<p>\u201cSo basically, you\u2019re so connected to Jeongguk that he\u2019s now the only thing that can make you feel warm?\u201d Jimin says slowly, bewildered. </p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so?\u201d Taehyung replies, flushing. He chances a glance in Jeongguk\u2019s direction and finds him wide-eyed, wearing what the fans had affectionately dubbed his \u201cJung-shook\u201d expression. Taehyung would give anything to know what\u2019s going on in his mind right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d Hoseok says, shaking his head. \u201cA fortune cookie? There\u2019s no way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems like a pretty crazy coincidence though,\u201d Namjoon says thoughtfully. \u201cI mean, if we suspend our disbelief - it kind of does fit with what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, assuming that is, in fact the reason,\u201d Jimin cuts in. \u201cHow do we get him back to normal? You guys can\u2019t just be attached at the hip forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t think that would be the worst thing ever, but Jimin has a point - they\u2019re going to have to be apart at some point. His mind goes back to the second part of the fortune. </p>\n<p>\n<em>Where there is honesty, there is relief.</em>\n</p>\n<p>It seems like that might be the answer, but he has no idea what it\u2019s supposed to mean.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I can get in touch with the lady who yelled at me,\u201d he suggests. \u201cShe seemed to know this was going to happen, maybe she\u2019ll know how to make it stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk flinches next to him, but when Taehyung looks over, his gaze is fixed on his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, yeah,\u201d Namjoon says, nodding. \u201cLet\u2019s start with that. I\u2019m sure someone on the staff can get us her name, or at least the name of the catering company.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Taehyung shoots a text to a few of the staff members he trusts the most, and everyone relaxes a little with the knowledge that they\u2019re making progress towards figuring this whole thing out. The rest of the day hurries by, a little quieter than the past few now that the Muster is over. In the late afternoon, one of the staff members gets back to him with a name for the catering company, and Taehyung calls and leaves a message. He debates using a fake name, but decides in this instance his real one might yield better results. In general, he prefers not to take advantage of the privileges that come with being an idol, but this feels like a special set of circumstances.</p>\n<p>In reality, though, the thing that he can\u2019t get off his mind all day isn\u2019t the fortune cookie, but Jeongguk. What had happened between them last night, and this morning - the feeling of Jeongguk\u2019s hand on the bare skin of his waist. All Taehyung wants to do is kiss him again, but he can\u2019t exactly do that with the other five members hovering around. Holding hands or hanging off of each other is enough to keep Taehyung warm, but it\u2019s not enough to satisfy the hunger that\u2019s building inside of him, begging for more.</p>\n<p>By the time they crawl back into bed that night - Taehyung\u2019s, again - Taehyung has worked himself up into a bit of a nervous tizzy. This isn\u2019t like him, not at all, and it\u2019s frustrating. Sure, this thing with Jeongguk has been simmering in the back of his mind for years, even more markedly in the past six months, but he\u2019s never really given it room to breathe. Now, this debacle with the fortune cookie and his body\u2019s newfound dependence on Jeongguk is messing with his head, making it hard to distinguish between what\u2019s stemming from the fortune and what\u2019s... just him.</p>\n<p>Taehyung is the first to get into bed, rolling on to his side, facing away from Jeongguk as he attempts to quiet the chaos in his mind. A few minutes later, the covers lift and the bed dips as Jeongguk slips in behind him, one arm draping loosely over Taehyung\u2019s waist. He leans back into Jeongguk\u2019s touch until they\u2019re essentially spooning, Jeongguk\u2019s breath warm against the back of his neck. Every sense in his body feels heightened, pulled taut.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs, right behind his ear. Something in his voice makes Taehyung turn to look at him, their eyes meeting over Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Jeongguk\u2019s gaze is intense, almost pleading, and Taehyung knows in that moment that he doesn\u2019t stand a chance.</p>\n<p>When their lips meet, Jeongguk tastes like toothpaste, the special spearmint one that Jimin uses and they all regularly steal. He\u2019s more confident this time, kissing Taehyung firmly, his tongue slipping past Taehyung\u2019s lips without hesitation or preamble. Distantly, Taehyung wonders when Jeongguk got so good at this, and how, and with who. An irrational sort of jealousy settles in his stomach at the thought of Jeongguk kissing anyone else.</p>\n<p>He turns fully so as to gain better access to Jeongguk\u2019s mouth, allowing one adventurous hand to slip under Jeongguk\u2019s sleep shirt and over the warm expanse of his lower back. Jeongguk lets out a small whimper, and without really meaning to, Taehyung cants his hips forward. They collide with Jeongguk\u2019s, and - </p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jeongguk cries, panicked, springing backwards.</p>\n<p>Taehyung freezes, afraid he\u2019s pushed too far. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk is rapidly turning the color of a tomato, and the pieces start falling into place for Taehyung. \u201cNothing, I just, I\u2019m - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hard,\u201d Taehyung breathes, and Jeongguk squeezes his eyes shut, nodding.</p>\n<p>Experimentally, Taehyung places a hand on his waist, shimmying forward until their lower bodies are pressed together again. Jeongguk\u2019s hips jerk, and Taehyung can feel him, hard against his leg. White hot arousal surges through his body, stronger than anything he\u2019s ever felt before. </p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d Jeongguk says warningly, an edge of desperation in his voice. </p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d Taehyung soothes, rolling his hips forward. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jeongguk gasps, his eyes rolling back. He\u2019s still holding himself very still, and Taehyung can feel the tightly coiled tension in his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Taehyung urges, tugging lightly at Jeongguk\u2019s hair. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>A floodgate seems to break, and Jeongguk groans, rolling forward until he\u2019s on top of Taehyung, their hips aligned. Taehyung grabs the back of his neck, kissing him sloppily as their groins rub together, the sensation heady and delicious. It feels a little bit like drowning, but in the best way possible.</p>\n<p>In all their years of friendship, this is a side of Jeongguk that Taehyung has never seen before - insatiable, almost unhinged. He\u2019s usually so tightly composed, acutely self-aware even when he\u2019s relaxed or goofing off. But now, it\u2019s like he\u2019s lost control of himself, let his mind shut down for once and his body take over. His hips strain against Taehyung\u2019s, his breathing harsh as he pulls away from his mouth to kiss along his throat. Taehyung gives it back as well as he can, arching up to meet him, fingertips teasing at the skin just above Jeongguk\u2019s ass.</p>\n<p>God, there is so much that he wants to do.</p>\n<p>With two layers of clothing separating them, the friction against their cocks is secondary at best, but Taehyung doesn\u2019t care, doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll last much longer anyway. He\u2019s got Jeongguk over him, swearing into his mouth, the muscles in his back and abdomen tense beneath Taehyung\u2019s hands. It\u2019s honestly a miracle Taehyung hasn\u2019t come already.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, Tae,\u201d Jeongguk pants against his cheek. \u201cOh my god, oh my god,\u201d he repeats, his words matching the rhythm of his hips. He\u2019s close, Taehyung can tell, and the realization nearly knocks him out. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung murmurs encouragingly, breathless himself. \u201cYeah, me too, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk whines, a shudder wracking his body, and then stills. <em>Jeongguk just came, Jeongguk just came</em> flashes in giant neon letters in Taehyung\u2019s brain, and he comes before he even feels Jeongguk\u2019s wetness seeping through his sweatpants, comes with Jeongguk\u2019s damp forehead resting against his shoulder. </p>\n<p>They lie like that for a few minutes, their chests rising and falling against each other, both of them in a sort of stunned silence. It takes a little while for Taehyung to come back to his senses, to process what had just happened, that he had just gotten of with <em>Jeongguk</em>. The kissing had been one thing, could be written off as just another part of this very weird situation they\u2019ve found themselves in, but this - Taehyung\u2019s not sure if there\u2019s any coming back from this. </p>\n<p>As each second ticks by, the silence gets more and more awkward and oppressive, and the drying cum in Taehyung\u2019s boxers gets increasingly uncomfortable. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019d literally come in his pants - he hasn\u2019t done that since he was like 15, Jesus - but then again, Jeongguk had too. And he had done it first.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Taehyung says when the quiet becomes too much for him to bear, prodding at him gently. For a moment, he wonders if Jeongguk had actually fallen asleep on top of him (wouldn\u2019t be the first time), but then he gives a low grunt and rolls to the side.</p>\n<p>His face is bright red, and now it makes more sense why he had kept it buried in Taehyung\u2019s shoulder for so long. As is often the case, Taehyung is distracted from his own discomfort by a sort of compulsive need to put Jeongguk at ease. It\u2019s a habit he\u2019d developed a long time ago, back when Jeongguk was still shy around all of them, and he\u2019s never quite shaken it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, rolling up on his side to look at Jeongguk, cheek propped on his fist. \u201cThat was new.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk snorts, glancing over at him sideways. His expression is a strange mix of what Taehyung would venture to guess is fucked out and mortified.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Taehyung asks gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I just.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Taehyung admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it okay?\u201d Jeongguk asks worriedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than,\u201d Taehyung says quickly. He feels the best he\u2019s felt since before this whole thing started, warm and cozy. \u201cI mean, I came in my pants, so that\u2019s embarrassing, but. Otherwise, all good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles at Jeongguk, and is satisfied when it earns him a small grin in return. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, god,\u201d Jeongguk says, his nose scrunching up in distaste. \u201cI need to change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Taehyung giggles. \u201cJeez, we\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>This gets an actual laugh out of Jeongguk, and Taehyung is relieved to feel the tension in the room lessening.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk gets up to go get fresh clothes from his own room, and Taehyung is left by himself to change as well. He\u2019s still kind of stunned by what had happened, but he can\u2019t say he regrets it - it had felt way too good. In a way, he wonders if he and Jeongguk have been building to this for a while, and he\u2019s only just realizing it now. Taehyung kind of has an excuse, what with this whole body heat thing, but what about Jeongguk? Is he just going along with this to help Taehyung? It wouldn\u2019t be out of character for him, Taehyung realizes with an odd sinking sensation. Then again, you can\u2019t really fake arousal, and Jeongguk had definitely been aroused. Ugh, fuck. This really is a mess.</p>\n<p>He pushes those thoughts aside when Jeongguk reappears in a fresh pair of sweats, pasting on a smile instead. His face has returned to its normal shade, but he hovers awkwardly by Taehyung\u2019s bed until Taehyung pats the spot next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTae,\u201d he says, climbing into bed. \u201cWe\u2019re okay, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course,\u201d Taehyung replies, sounding much more confident than he feels. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends. Nothing\u2019s going to change that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk looks relieved, but Taehyung\u2019s stomach twists uncomfortably. He\u2019s always believed that their friendship can weather almost anything, and at this point, it kind of has. But this is different, this puts them past some kind of invisible line, and Taehyung isn\u2019t sure where they\u2019ll stand when it\u2019s over. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The first thing Jeongguk sees when he wakes up is Taehyung, staring at him with wide, unblinking eyes. Those eyes will be the death of him, Jeongguk has long felt - something about the shape of them makes him so weak. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Taehyung says brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jeongguk replies, reaching out tentatively and closing his hand around Taehyung\u2019s forearm. He seems to be at a normal temperature, maybe a little cool. \u201cWarm enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Taehyung nods. \u201cThanks. I wanted to talk to you, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s stomach lurches, memories of what had happened between them crashing back into his consciousness. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been so amazing about all of this,\u201d Taehyung begins, and Jeongguk\u2019s stomach clenches. He\u2019d been too transparent, he knows it, and now Taehyung is going to let him down easy, tell him they need to go back to just hugging and cuddling. \u201cBut I just want to make sure you don\u2019t feel like you have to do this? For me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk blinks at him, confused. \u201cYou need me, though,\u201d he says, hating how much he\u2019s coming to rely on that knowledge in the past few days. He knows he should want Taehyung to get better, and he does, but a selfish part of him has loved every minute of this. \u201cOr you\u2019ll get too cold.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cI meant, more, like, the other stuff? The kissing, and, ah - getting off together.\u201d His cheeks are faintly pink. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to feel obligated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk snorts so loudly that Taehyung startles, looking almost offended, but he can\u2019t help it - the idea that he, Jeon Jeongguk, doesn\u2019t want this with 100% of his being is so ludicrous it\u2019s laughable. \u201cI don\u2019t feel obligated,\u201d he says in a rush. \u201cI - <em>believe me</em>. I would tell you if I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if he would ever not want to, as if he hasn\u2019t spent the last five years dreaming about what it would be like to have this with Taehyung. He just wishes Taehyung wanted this on his own, and not because of some weird fortune cookie curse that\u2019s throwing his body out of wack, but he pushes that thought aside for now. Jeongguk\u2019s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, especially not when it\u2019s giving him open access to Taehyung\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, good,\u201d Taehyung says, looking relieved. \u201cIn that case...\u201d he trails off, biting his lip, and fuck, it makes Jeongguk crazy when he does that. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jeongguk prompts, breathless. His hand is still wrapped around Taehyung\u2019s forearm, and he gives a slight tug, urging him forward. Taehyung comes easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d he repeats, more firmly this time. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you now.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he does, leaning in as Jeongguk\u2019s hand comes up to cradle the back of his head. His hair is so soft beneath Jeongguk\u2019s fingers, his lips pliant and eager against Jeongguk\u2019s own. They\u2019ve done this a lot over the past 48 hours, but Jeongguk still hasn\u2019t gotten used to it, still feels a rush in his stomach with every new sound and touch.</p>\n<p>He bites down lightly on Taehyung\u2019s lower lip, curious, and feels a jolt of arousal when Taehyung lets out a soft whimper of approval. His hand sneaks up under Taehyung\u2019s too-big T-shirt, fingers splaying across his back, his skin surprisingly warm to the touch. Taehyung arches closer, hitching one leg up over Jeongguk\u2019s, and oh, fuck - he\u2019s already half hard. </p>\n<p>The realization sends Jeongguk into a tailspin, a moan ripped from his throat when he feels Taehyung pressed hot against his thigh. He rocks his own hips forward immediately, searching for that same friction they had found last night. </p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Taehyung breathes, winding an arm around Jeongguk\u2019s neck. His voice is shaky. \u201cTouch me?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Jeongguk knows, he knows what Taehyung is asking for, just as clearly as he knows he\u2019s probably going to die from being so insanely, painfully turned on. He nods frantically, their noses bumping together, one hand smoothing down Taehyung\u2019s side and coming to a halt on his waist. There, he freezes, fingers suspended over the waistband of Taehyung\u2019s sweatpants, too overcome to know what to do next.</p>\n<p>Taehyung whimpers against his mouth, nosing at Jeongguk\u2019s cheek impatiently. Jeongguk takes a moment to look at him, really look at him - his eyes are squeezed shut, his lips kissed raw. There\u2019s something in his face, a kind of pleading desperation, that finally spurs Jeongguk back into action, his hand moving to cup Taehyung through his sweats. Taehyung gasps, jerking into Jeongguk\u2019s palm, and fuck if it\u2019s not the hottest thing Jeongguk has ever experienced.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore,\u201d Taehyung begs, pressing a sloppy kiss to the corner of Jeongguk\u2019s mouth. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk obliges, tugging at Taehyung\u2019s sweats until he can close a trembling hand around his cock. He\u2019s hard and heavy in Jeongguk\u2019s palm, which like, 1) fuck and also 2) FUCK, because this is actually happening. He fights to keep his breathing even, stroking firmly, watching in awe as Taehyung\u2019s face goes almost slack with pleasure. Jeongguk is achingly hard in his own pants, but it\u2019s worth it for the small noises that are slipping from Taehyung\u2019s lips, for the knowledge that Jeongguk is the one making him feel this way. He never, ever wants to forget this feeling.</p>\n<p>Emboldened, Jeongguk brushes his thumb over the tip of Taehyung\u2019s cock, smearing the pre-come that\u2019s been gathering there. Taehyung jolts, pulling Jeongguk to him and kissing him filthily, their tongues tangling. It\u2019s intensely intimate, to have Taehyung in his hand and to feel his every quake and shudder against his own mouth. He strokes harder, more diligently, twisting his wrist as Taehyung whines and hikes his leg up higher on Jeongguk\u2019s waist. </p>\n<p>He can tell Taehyung is close when he starts fucking into the circle of Jeongguk\u2019s hand, when the kisses cease and instead his teeth catch on Jeongguk\u2019s lower lip. Elated, dizzy with arousal, Jeongguk pulls him through it, watching in awe as Taehyung\u2019s features crumple, his lips forming a perfect \u201co\u201d. He lets out a small whimper, slumping sideways, his come coating Jeongguk\u2019s stomach and hand. It\u2019s so insanely hot, and Jeongguk can\u2019t help himself - when Taehyung\u2019s hips stutter against his, he comes too, biting down on his lip to stop himself from moaning aloud. His face flames, but Taehyung doesn\u2019t seem to notice just yet, still coming down from his own high. </p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d he breathes, kissing Jeongguk softly. \u201cWe should\u2019ve been doing this all along.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s stomach gives a funny kind of flip, because this is <em>exactly</em> what he\u2019s wanted all along, and he wonders what Taehyung really means - if it\u2019s just this weird spell he\u2019s under, or the sex, or maybe, if Jeongguk really lets himself hope, maybe more. </p>\n<p>Taehyung reaches for the front of his pants, and Jeongguk flinches away, but it\u2019s too late - his hand settles over Jeongguk\u2019s cock and finds the telltale wetness there. Jeongguk hisses at the oversensitivity, mortified, and watches in horror as Taehyung makes the connection.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust... from watching me?\u201d he says, breathless, his eyes wide. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk nods jerkily, avoiding Taehyung\u2019s gaze. This is so embarrassing, now Taehyung will know how pathetically gone Jeongguk is for him and get freaked out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so fucking hot,\u201d Taehyung breathes, and Jeongguk\u2019s eyes snap up to his, stunned. Taehyung has always been full of surprises in regular life, so Jeongguk supposes it makes sense that that applies to sex as well. He shifts closer, so that their lips are just barely brushing, his fingers tangling in the hair at Jeongguk\u2019s nape. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get a hand on you, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk chokes on his own spit, gagging, and Taehyung responds by bursting into laughter, tucking his face into the side of Jeongguk\u2019s neck. His fingers still rest loosely in Jeongguk\u2019s hair, and it feels so simply intimate that Jeongguk\u2019s heart aches with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus <em>Christ</em>, Taehyung,\u201d Jeongguk whines. \u201cYou can\u2019t just <em>say</em> stuff like that, shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSays who?\u201d Taehyung challenges, pulling back to level Jeongguk with a cheeky grin. Seriously, this man will be the death of him. \u201cI think you like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk flushes again, gaping at him, but Taehyung just giggles and tugs him in for another kiss. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They\u2019re recording two interviews that day, which means a lot of time in the car and getting primped by the stylists, and a little time actually talking to interviewers. During a break between the two, Taehyung checks his phone and finds that he has a voicemail from the Golden Disc catering company, saying they will gladly put him in touch with whoever he needs to speak to. Oddly, he\u2019s not as relieved by this news as he expected to be. </p>\n<p>He gets up from his position leaning against Jeongguk to go call them back somewhere more private, waving off Jeongguk\u2019s confused look. Someone actually answers this time, and after a few tries, they patch him through to the woman who was managing the concession table on the second night of the Golden Disc Awards. Her name is Yuna, and he immediately recognizes her voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s known him for years. \u201cI was wondering when I would hear from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung feels like he\u2019s in some sort cliche scene from a bad movie, but her greeting does reassure him that she won\u2019t think he\u2019s an insane person when he asks whether it is in fact possible to fall under a spell cast by a magical fortune cookie.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, umm, hello,\u201d he replies, not really sure how to broach the subject. \u201cThank you for speaking with me. I wanted your advice, as it seems...\u201d He clears his throat. This is easily one of the weirdest conversations he\u2019s ever had. \u201cThe fortune in that fortune cookie has come true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why we tell you not to eat them,\u201d Yuna says sternly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can understand that now, yes.\u201d There\u2019s silence on the other end of the line, so Taehyung presses on. \u201cI was wondering, umm... if you knew how long it would last? Or how I can make it go away? It\u2019s become a bit of a personal health risk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe answer is in the fortune,\u201d Yuna says sagely. She doesn\u2019t sound particularly concerned about Taehyung\u2019s health.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Where there is honesty, there is relief?\u2019\u201d Taehyung recites. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very dense, then,\u201d Yuna chides. She\u2019s not one to be gobsmacked by the fact that Taehyung is an idol, clearly. \u201cOr you\u2019re just lying to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung gapes at his phone, even though Yuna obviously can\u2019t see him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says, feeling like an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce you are honest with yourself, the fortune will lift,\u201d Yuna says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonest with myself about what, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the fortune, Taehyung. It\u2019s not my place to interpret it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut - \u201d Taehyung starts, exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is all I can do for you,\u201d Yuna interrupts. \u201cYou will need to figure the rest out on your own. Good luck, Taehyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>And she hangs up, leaving Taehyung possibly even more confused than he had been before. On the bright side, at least he knows now that he\u2019s not totally insane, and that this is actually happening to him because of a goddamn fortune cookie (although how that\u2019s even possible, he still doesn\u2019t understand). On the less bright side, he doesn\u2019t feel any closer to figuring out what the second part of the fortune means, or how to make this - condition, or whatever it is - go away. </p>\n<p>He walks back into the room where the other members are waiting, and Jeongguk greets him with a curious look, opening his arm to make room for Taehyung duck under. It\u2019s so warm and cozy pressed against his side, and not for the first time Taehyung thinks to himself that it wouldn\u2019t be so bad if he had to rely on this for a while longer. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe woman from the catering company called me,\u201d he says quietly, absentmindedly linking his fingers with Jeongguk\u2019s. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk tenses so slightly that Taehyung only notices because he can literally feel it. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, first of all, that I\u2019m not totally losing it, this is happening because of the fortune cookie,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cBut also that the answer for how to make it go away is in the fortune itself, which I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk hums, resting his chin on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat did it say, again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething about finding honesty.\u201d He\u2019s still conveniently forgotten to mention to anyone the part of the fortune that includes the word \u201clove\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonesty about what?\u201d Jeongguk asks, looking puzzled. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re pretty honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shrugs. \u201cNo idea, and the lady wasn\u2019t much help in figuring it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe the hyungs will have an idea,\u201d Jeongguk suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Taehyung agrees. He snuggles closer to Jeongguk, slinging his legs over his lap. \u201cAt least I have you to keep me warm until we figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk smiles and hugs him tighter, and Taehyung thinks again that really, this isn\u2019t so bad.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Jimin finds him in the kitchen while Taehyung is in the shower, one of the rare moments these days when they\u2019re not attached at the hip. Jeongguk is staring aimlessly into one of the cabinets above the sink, not particularly hungry, mostly just looking for something to take his mind off of its near constant loop of <em>Taehyung Taehyung Taehyung</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jimin says, padding into the kitchen and startling Jeongguk out of his listless reverie.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin perches himself on one of the stools surrounding the center island, leveling Jeongguk with that look he gets when he\u2019s about to Spit Some Truths. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, folding his hands together.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk decides to go for the \u201cplay dumb\u201d approach first. \u201cUh... yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Predictably, Jimin sighs. \u201cI mean, like, with this whole thing with Tae.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk returns his attention to the still open cabinet, examining it closely without really seeing anything. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d he asks defensively.</p>\n<p>This is the wrong answer. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, maybe because you\u2019ve been harboring secret feelings for him for literally years?\u201d Jimin says quietly, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk whirls to face him, horrified. \u201cShut <em>up</em>,\u201d he hisses.</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks at him, unimpressed. \u201cTell me that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI - I mean. How even - what?\u201d Jeongguk stammers. He\u2019s never talked about this with anyone before, never. Except for, okay, that one night years ago when he had gotten too drunk and confessed a diluted version of the truth to Jimin. But that had been <em>years</em> ago. \u201cThat was a long time ago, I don\u2019t - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeonggukie,\u201d Jimin says gently. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk sighs, defeated. In an odd way, it feels like a relief, to have a tiny piece of this secret lifted off of his chest. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d he asks quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cSince, like, forever,\u201d Jimin says, shrugging, as if this isn\u2019t the single biggest secret of Jeongguk\u2019s life, one he\u2019s spent the past 5 years guarding. \u201cBefore you even told me that one time when we were wasted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk flushes. \u201cIs it really that obvious?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not to the others,\u201d Jimin says thoughtfully. \u201cAlthough I feel like Namjoon might suspect. But to me, yes. You just... are softer, with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think <em>he</em> knows?\u201d Jeongguk asks, staring at his hands, his voice very small.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking oblivious, but no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk lets out a sigh of relief at this, his stomach unknotting slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re okay,\u201d Jimin says kindly, patting Jeongguk\u2019s hand. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s easy for you to be so close to him all the time, sharing a bed every night.\u201d</p>\n<p>And because it\u2019s apparently fucking honesty hour, Jeongguk says: \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of been, umm. You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cI KNEW you two were acting weird!\u201d he cries, half accusing and half smug. \u201cShit. So you\u2019re like, in it, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk nods. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can stop.\u201d His voice is barely above a whisper. It\u2019s true - he knows this is going to hurt like hell when it\u2019s over, when Taehyung\u2019s body goes back to normal. But he also doesn\u2019t see any scenario in which he\u2019s physically able to walk away from whatever Taehyung is willing to give him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Jeonggukie,\u201d Jimin says sadly, slipping off his stool and walking over to hug Jeongguk around the middle. \u201cWhat if you just... tell him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t, not right now. Not when he\u2019s literally physically dependent on me. It wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much about this situation is fair,\u201d Jimin observes. \u201cOr logically possible, but whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung\u2019s health is the most important thing to me right now,\u201d Jeongguk says firmly. \u201cEverything else can wait.\u201d And he really believes this, even if the \u201ceverything else\u201d is breaking his fragile heart.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks at him fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re a really, really good friend,\u201d he says, hugging Jeongguk tighter.</p>\n<p>The problem is, Jeongguk worries that\u2019s all he\u2019ll ever be.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They have the next morning off, and Taehyung spends it draped fully on top of Jeongguk, playing games on his phone while Jeongguk catches up on responding to emails from various family members. It\u2019s quiet, tranquil, with the added bonus that Taehyung feels like he\u2019s lying on top of one of those electrically heated blankets. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s the fam?\u201d he asks when Jeongguk snaps his laptop shut. His chin is propped on Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey seem good,\u201d Jeongguk replies, stretching his arms out in front of him and wiggling his fingers. \u201cThey always say how much they miss me, it makes me feel guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung understands that - this crazy, incredible, whirlwind life of theirs doesn\u2019t allow much time for family, and they end up missing a lot. The guilt weighs on Taehyung as well, especially when he thinks about his younger siblings. Still, he doesn\u2019t think he would change anything, especially when he considers this second family the seven of them have made, closer and more dear to him than he ever could have imagined when they first met.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re making them so proud, though,\u201d Taehyung says reassuringly, rubbing his thumb over Jeongguk\u2019s arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jeongguk sighs. \u201cAnd I mean, this is so - this is my dream, beyond my dream. I just wish I could be both, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Taehyung says. He\u2019s tempted to kiss the back of Jeongguk\u2019s neck, but restrains himself. \u201cBut we should remember to make the most of what we have right now. It won\u2019t be this way forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk is quiet for a moment. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cThat makes me sad to think about too.\u201d He pauses again, and Taehyung wishes he could see the expression on his face right now. It feels like something has shifted in their conversation. \u201cI like the way things are now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Taehyung replies softly, resting his cheek along the plane of Jeongguk\u2019s back. The fear that\u2019s been nagging at him all week, and especially since he spoke to Yuna, gains more traction in his brain. What is he going to do when he isn\u2019t reliant on Jeongguk\u2019s body heat anymore? </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go shower,\u201d Jeongguk announces abruptly. Taehyung makes a noise of dissent but rolls off of him anyway, ignoring the pit in his stomach as he watches Jeongguk discard his shirt and disappear out into the hallway.</p>\n<p>He flops back on to Jeongguk\u2019s pillows, enjoying the scent of Jeongguk that surrounds him, and stays there for all of one minute before leaping up and following Jeongguk out the door. If their time in this sort of weird limbo is limited, he\u2019s damn sure going to make the most of it. </p>\n<p>The hallway is blessedly empty as he makes his way to the bathroom, knocking lightly on the door when he finds it locked. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m about to shower!\u201d Jeongguk calls from inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Taehyung responds, his mouth pressed up against the small crack between the door and its frame. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence, and then the door opens slightly, Jeongguk peering out at him curiously. He\u2019s still dressed in just his sweats, his torso lean and taut. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cAre you too cold?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shakes his head, pushing past Jeongguk and shutting the door behind him, locking it. Jeongguk looks between him and the door, confused, and Taehyung feels a heady rush of excitement and desire.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just was thinking,\u201d he murmurs, stepping closer, so that Jeongguk is crowded up against the counter. The words feel impossibly bold on his tongue, but he can\u2019t stop himself from saying them. \u201cHow I haven\u2019t gotten to touch you, yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk inhales sharply, eyes going wide, his hands scrambling to clutch at Taehyung\u2019s hips. \u201cJesus,\u201d he says, and Taehyung kisses him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d Taehyung asks, fingers hovering at his waistband, just barely brushing the skin there. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>God</em>, yes,\u201d Jeongguk breathes, his mouth chasing Taehyung\u2019s, so that when Taehyung smirks, it\u2019s against his lips. </p>\n<p>He reaches for Jeongguk, the heel of his palm pressing experimentally against his groin, smile widening when he finds him half hard. He quirks a self-satisfied eyebrow at Jeongguk, who groans and grabs the back of his head, pulling him in for another kiss. </p>\n<p>Jerking Jeongguk off is one of the more gratifying experiences Taehyung has had in his life. His body is exceptionally responsive, jumping under every touch of Taehyung\u2019s hand. He whimpers when Taehyung finally wraps a hand around his length, hips arching hard off the counter, his hands flying back to steady himself. Jeongguk is the one with his cock out, but Taehyung flushes under his gaze, dark and hungry, his lips just slightly parted.</p>\n<p>When Jeongguk comes, his head is thrown back, throat exposed as Taehyung presses a row of kisses from his chin to his collarbone. The noises he\u2019s making have gotten progressively less restrained, soft whines devolving into something rawer, louder, more guttural. Taehyung wonders vaguely if they\u2019re being loud enough for someone to hear if they pass by in the hallway, feels a zing of arousal at the prospect. He\u2019s drunk on the knowledge that he can make Jeongguk feel this way, that this gorgeous boy who gives away so little is shaking apart under his hands, Taehyung\u2019s name on his lips. </p>\n<p>He comes across Taehyung\u2019s shirt, which incidentally is actually one of Jeongguk\u2019s shirts that he had borrowed earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he winces, eyes settling on the mess once Taehyung has tucked him carefully back into his sweatpants.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your shirt,\u201d Taehyung replies cheerily.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk sighs. \u201cI thought it looked big on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess we have no choice but to get cleaned up,\u201d Taehyung says brightly, stripping off the dirty T-shirt and dropping it on the floor. He steps out of his sweats as well, preening a little when Jeongguk\u2019s gaze snags on the obvious bulge in his briefs. </p>\n<p>\u201cLike - together?\u201d Jeongguk chokes out when Taehyung turns on the shower and looks at him expectantly. His eyes are almost comically round.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you\u2019d rather take turns,\u201d Taehyung says, raising an eyebrow at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d he nearly shouts, then flushes. \u201cI mean, no, or yes - let\u2019s, god.\u201d He looks so adorably flustered that Taehyung can\u2019t resist stepping forward and kissing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, together, then?\u201d he murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Acting bolder than he actually feels, Taehyung steps back from him and tugs off his briefs. Jeongguk has literally touched his cock before, but he stills feels exposed, standing here totally naked in front of him. A flush threatens to creep up his neck, until he notices the way Jeongguk is looking at him, eyes raking over his body like he\u2019s never wanted anything so badly in his life. Under a gaze like that, it\u2019s hard to stay shy for long.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do realize you need to take your clothes off before you get in the shower,\u201d Taehyung teases, giggling when Jeongguk nearly trips over himself in his rush to pull off his sweatpants and underwear.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, you dork,\u201d he says fondly, extending his hand to Jeongguk once he\u2019s fully undressed. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes linger on his outstretched hand for just a moment before he takes it and follows Taehyung into the hot spray of the shower.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>So Taehyung\u2019s day starts with an orgasm, and then they have dance practices all afternoon, followed by a sweaty, exhausted dinner. Jeongguk slips away to call his parents before bed, and Taehyung finds himself in Jimin\u2019s room with Jimin and Namjoon, not doing much of anything in particular. It doesn\u2019t occur to him that this may have been a bit of a set up until Namjoon says:</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Tae, any progress on the whole fortune cookie front?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shrugs. He\u2019d told them in passing that he\u2019d spoken to Yuna yesterday, but hadn\u2019t given much detail. He supposes he should have expected them to press it further at some point. The real question here is why Taehyung himself hasn\u2019t been more invested in figuring it out, given that his own health seems to be at risk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuna basically said I have to figure it out by myself,\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer\u2019s in the fortune, or so she says.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we read the actual fortune?\u201d Jimin asks. \u201cLike, word for word? Maybe we\u2019re missing something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung blanches, and Jimin looks at him suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon is watching him curiously too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, umm,\u201d Taehyung says sheepishly. \u201cMaybe adjusted the language, just a little? When I told you guys about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin glares at him, and Namjoon sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, come on, let\u2019s hear it,\u201d Namjoon says. </p>\n<p>Taehyung swallows. He supposes now is as good as time as any to tell them - it was going to have to come out eventually. \u201cSo, the full thing said: Where there is love, there is warmth.\u201d He winces a little at the word love, and he can tell Namjoon and Jimin catch it too. \u201cWhere there is honesty, there is relief.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon whistles. \u201cLove, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung buries his face in his hands, nodding. \u201cI mean, obviously I love Jeongguk,\u201d he scrambles to say. \u201cBut I love all of you guys too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s... different?\u201d Jimin suggests gently, as if he\u2019s afraid of scaring Taehyung off with his words. He seems less surprised by this development than Namjoon.</p>\n<p>It is different, Taehyung knows that. It\u2019s always been different with Jeongguk, pretty much since day one. And now they have this weird connection, and they\u2019re hooking up, and it\u2019s just - it\u2019s a lot, and Taehyung doesn\u2019t know how to process it all.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he groans, flopping back on Jimin\u2019s bed. He\u2019s starting to feel a little chilly again, and his body craves Jeongguk, even as his mind reels. \u201cI just, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods sympathetically, sitting down next to him and patting his leg. As usual, his touch feels lukewarm - pleasant, but nothing compared to how it feels when Jeongguk touches him, the heat that explodes through his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we should focus on the other part of the fortune,\u201d Namjoon suggests. He\u2019s sitting on the floor, knees bent up in front of him, arms draped across them. \u201cThe part about honesty bringing relief.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuna said I had to be honest with myself,\u201d Taehyung says, sitting up. \u201cAnd that would end this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe...\u201d Jimin begins, looking thoughtful. \u201cMaybe, you have to be honest with yourself about the source of the warmth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung blinks at him. \u201cAbout Jeongguk?\u201d he says, throat suddenly dry. \u201cI already know it has to come from him, though. And why, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shrugs. \u201cJust a thought.\u201d </p>\n<p>Taehyung looks back and forth between Jimin and Namjoon, not feeling particularly good about the assessing looks they\u2019re giving him. Is he missing something here? Of course he loves Jungkook, they\u2019re best friends - there\u2019s nothing new there. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should get back to him,\u201d Namjoon says, breaking into his thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to shiver.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung nods silently, wrapping his arms around himself as he bids them goodnight. He\u2019s oddly nervous as he walks to Jeongguk\u2019s room, his conversation with Jimin and Namjoon lingering in his mind. The feelings that have been accumulating in the back of his mind over the course of this week clamor for attention, but he does his best to block them out. Just because he and Jeongguk are hooking up now doesn\u2019t mean anything else has changed. And besides, he doesn\u2019t even know how Jeongguk feels about all of this, other than that he seems to be enjoying the sex part just as much as Taehyung is.</p>\n<p>He knocks lightly at Jeongguk\u2019s door, realizing belatedly that he never knocks. Maybe he just needed the extra few seconds to collect himself. The door swings open and Jeongguk appears, phone in hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, sorry, I was just coming to find you,\u201d he says, ushering Taehyung inside. \u201cI can never get my mom off the phone, you know how it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Taehyung says quietly. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk takes in the way he\u2019s hunched in on himself and reaches for his face, eyebrows furrowing in concern. \u201cShit, Tae, you\u2019re cold,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should have come and gotten me sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Taehyung protests, even though he\u2019s not, really.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk ignores him, yanking his shirt over his head and pulling him close. Taehyung smiles fondly at the way his hair sticks up at odd angles and allows himself to be held, resting his cheek on Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. The warmth seeps back into him slowly, spreading through his heart and out to the tips of his fingers and toes. He thinks he could stay here standing like this forever. A part of him aches to tell Jeongguk that, but the more practical side of his brain keeps him quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to sleep?\u201d Jeongguk asks, when Taehyung yawns into his neck. He nods, exhaustion tugging at his eyelids. Sleep sounds a lot more appealing than sorting through the mess in his brain right now. </p>\n<p>He follows Jeongguk into bed, and they curl up side by side, Jeongguk curving around him and holding him close. It makes Taehyung melt, just a little. </p>\n<p>\u201cWarm enough?\u201d Jeongguk asks, his breath soft against Taehyung\u2019s ear. Taehyung squeezes his eyes shut, because it\u2019s so sweet, but it\u2019s also a reminder of why they\u2019re in this position in the first place - not because they chose to be, but because of the fortune, and Taehyung\u2019s physical well-being. Jeongguk is just being a good friend, like he always is.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Taehyung whispers, eyes stinging traitorously as he feels Jeongguk\u2019s nose press against the back of his neck. He resists the urge to thread his fingers with Jeongguk\u2019s and wills himself to sleep instead.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Taehyung is stretched out underneath Jeongguk, chest bare, lips kissed pink and swollen, pupils slightly dilated. He looks throughly debauched from just a few minutes of kissing, and Jeongguk can\u2019t help but feel a little smug about it. The expanse of his chest is smooth and unmarred, his belly flat and tender, and all Jeongguk wants to do is ruin him, leave marks from his collarbones down to the jut of his hips. Jesus fuck, he just <em>wants</em> so fucking much.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Taehyung can\u2019t hear the thoughts ricocheting around in his head, although he can probably read them on Jeongguk\u2019s face when he reaches for him, fingers weaving into his hair as he pulls him in for a kiss. He\u2019s hard, Jeongguk can feel it against his hip, and there\u2019s another thought hovering at the forefront of his mind, threatening to slip out any moment now: he wants to taste.</p>\n<p>Taehyung makes a noise of dissent when Jeongguk pulls away from his mouth, but it turns into a gasp when Jeongguk\u2019s teeth skim down his neck, tongue flicking over a nipple. He restrains himself from getting too caught up as he works his way down Taehyung\u2019s torso, but he can\u2019t resist sucking a bite or two into the soft, perfect skin. Taehyung, for his part, doesn\u2019t seem to mind, his head thrown back against the pillow as he squirms under Jeongguk\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jeongguk says when reaches the waistband of Taehyung\u2019s sweats, his voice breathier than he had intended. He\u2019s situated between Taehyung\u2019s legs now, hands resting on the outsides of his thighs, and he\u2019s so close to his cock that he can barely articulate a coherent sentence.</p>\n<p>Taehyung works himself up on to his elbows, looking down at him with dark eyes. \u201cYeah? he says. He has to know what Jeongguk\u2019s thinking, what with where he\u2019s currently positioned and all.</p>\n<p>The words tumble out of Jeongguk\u2019s mouth before he can stop them. \u201cHyung, can I,\u201d he stammers, swallowing. \u201cCanIgodownonyou,\u201d he finishes in a rush.</p>\n<p>Taehyung gapes at him, his eyes wide, and Jeongguk feels his cheeks flame. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to?\u201d Taehyung says, his voice cracked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to make you feel good,\u201d Jeongguk all but whispers. \u201cI think it\u2019ll make you feel good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s thought about it more than he cares to admit - if everything they\u2019ve done so far makes Taehyung warm, he wants to know what his mouth can do. And he wants to know more than that too, what it would feel like to be inside -</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, Jeongguk, <em>yes</em>,\u201d Taehyung says, his mouth still hanging open.</p>\n<p>Together, they fumble with Taehyung\u2019s pants and briefs, tugging them off in one go. Then Jeongguk settles back down between his legs, face to face with the magnificence that is Taehyung\u2019s cock and not a great deal of knowledge about what to do next. But Taehyung is still staring at him with a somewhat glazed over expression on his face, so he just goes for it, ducks his head and takes him down as far as he can go, flattening his tongue along the underside.</p>\n<p>From there, it comes naturally enough, hollowing out his cheeks to suck harder, tonguing at the slit and catching Taehyung\u2019s hips when they jerk up off the mattress. If Jeongguk thought Taehyung had been vocal before, it\u2019s nothing compared to this, his voice husky and wrecked as he whines prettily. His elbows give way beneath him at some point, and he collapses back into the pillows, one arm tossed over his eyes. </p>\n<p>When Taehyung comes, it takes them both by surprise, and Jeongguk gags a little, coughing even as he manages to swallow most of it. Taehyung is back up on his elbows as soon as he comes down from the high, reaching for Jeongguk guiltily.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry! I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says apologetically. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk crawls up his body, eyes still watering just a little, not that he cares at all. He just made Kim Taehyung come down his throat <em>and</em> managed not to come in his pants (though it was a near thing) in the process, which feels like a win win.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeonggukie,\u201d Taehyung murmurs adoringly, brushing a thumb over his lower lip. He\u2019s looking at Jeongguk almost reverently, the gaze making Jeongguk\u2019s heart ache. His eyes fall shut as Taehyung\u2019s knuckles graze over his cheek, and for one second he lets himself get lost, pretends he can have this always and not just because he managed to give Taehyung a halfway decent blow job.</p>\n<p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he pleads, wondering if Taehyung can hear the desperation in his voice, if he\u2019ll even want to kiss Jeongguk after where his mouth had just been. </p>\n<p>He gets his answer to the second question not 10 seconds later, when Taehyung not only kisses him but slides his tongue into Jeongguk\u2019s mouth, whimpering a little when he tastes himself there. It feels so filthy, but in the best way possible, and Jeongguk groans, pressing their lips together more urgently. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s grateful for the distraction when Taehyung rolls them over, whispering \u201cyour turn\u201d against his mouth before shimmying down his body. Jeongguk barely has the time to realize what he means before Taehyung\u2019s tongue is teasing around the head of his cock, and his brain effectively short circuits.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure how much longer he can do this, but he knows he never wants it to end. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminie,\u201d Taehyung moans, flinging himself down on Jimin\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d Jimin says patiently, spinning in his desk chair to face him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have a problem, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a lot of problems, but okay,\u201d Jimin says cheekily, and Taehyung sits up to glare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk gave me a blow job,\u201d Taehyung says, because that\u2019s easier than saying what he\u2019s actually thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Jesus Christ,\u201d Jimin wails, clapping his hands over his ears. \u201cI really super duper did not need to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung sulks, and Jimin sighs, pulling his hands away from his ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is this a problem? Was it bad or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, god, it was so good, fuck,\u201d Taehyung says hurriedly, glazing over for a minute when he remembers how it had felt to be engulfed in the spectacular heat of Jeongguk\u2019s mouth. And the way he had <em>looked</em> after, fuck. <em>Fuck</em>, Taehyung is so screwed.</p>\n<p>\u201cEarth to Taehyung,\u201d Jimin says loudly, snapping his fingers. \u201cEw, god, you\u2019re thinking about it right now aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Taehyung says sheepishly, his face heating up.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo then walk me through this,\u201d Jimin continues. \u201cIf it was that good - which, by the way, not surprised, the golden maknae <em>would</em> give grade A head - then why are you upset?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung groans, falling backwards on the bed again. \u201cWe keep doing this,\u201d he says. \u201cWe keep doing more and more, and I keep wanting more and more. I feel like I can barely even think straight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gets up from his chair and walks over to the bed, sitting down cross legged beside him. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s just because of the fortune cookie?\u201d he asks cautiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell,\u201d Taehyung sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s what started it, but... I can\u2019t tell anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it just about the sex?\u201d </p>\n<p>The question hangs in the air between them, and Taehyung\u2019s stomach clenches, because this is what\u2019s been nagging at him all along.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he whispers, covering his face with his hands. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m so fucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tugs on his wrist, pulling one hand away. \u201cMaybe you should just... talk to him?\u201d he suggests. \u201cFind out where his head is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shakes his head despairingly. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I can while this whole thing is going on. It\u2019s too complicated, I don\u2019t even know my own head right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels a little bit like a cop-out, but there\u2019s too much at stake right now: he can\u2019t risk further jeopardizing their friendship, especially when there\u2019s the minor detail of Taehyung still being physically dependent on Jeongguk\u2019s body heat. He doesn\u2019t want to make things even messier by dragging his feelings into it, especially when his judgment is being clouded by the fortune cookie.</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs. \u201cYeah, I understand. I still feel like you guys should talk though, once you\u2019re back to normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung nods, biting his lip. \u201cThe problem is, I don\u2019t want it to end.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin runs a hand through his hair, examining Taehyung carefully. \u201cWell,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you found your honesty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Really, though, Taehyung finds his honesty later that night, when he and Jeongguk are huddled together on the floor of Jeongguk\u2019s room, at least an hour deep into playing Overwatch. He\u2019s talking smack, obviously, and Jeongguk shoves him playfully, smiling that smile where his nose scrunches up and the left side of his mouth quirks a little higher than the right. His face is totally makeup free, his hair is flat and messy, and he\u2019s dressed in a giant hoodie, but Taehyung just loves him, is the thing. He really fucking loves him.</p>\n<p>Oh, shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jeongguk asks, because apparently Taehyung had said that last part out loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, never mind,\u201d Taehyung says hurriedly, shaking his head. Jeongguk gives him a weird look but shrugs and goes back to playing.</p>\n<p>Shit, fuck.</p>\n<p>It seems kind of obvious, now that he thinks about it, and he\u2019s not really sure how he hadn\u2019t realized it earlier. Maybe he did realize, and he\u2019s just been hiding from himself, like Yuna had implied. But now he knows it, clear as day: Taehyung loves Jeongguk, and it\u2019s not in the way he loves the other boys - he loves him like a shock of heat through his body, the kind that makes you feel warm all over. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When Taehyung wakes up the next morning, the space between him and Jeongguk confirms what he already suspected. He feels completely normal, not too cold, and when he reaches over to tentatively touch Jeongguk\u2019s hand, he finds him lukewarm, nothing compared to the rush of warmth he\u2019s grown accustomed to over this past week. He pulls his hand away quickly, and his stomach drops. He\u2019s been cured, and this thing between them, whatever it is - it\u2019s over.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jeongguk says sleepily, blinking awake. His face is smushed into his pillow, and he looks so adorable that Taehyung is tempted to lie and pretend that nothing has changed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he replies, his voice strangled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jeongguk asks, reaching for him. His hand closes around Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and just like before, the touch of his skin just feels... normal.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI think...\u201d He swallows, forcing himself to continue speaking. \u201cI think I\u2019m better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s eyes widen, and he yanks his hand away as if he\u2019s been burned. Taehyung flinches.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says hollowly. \u201cSo you\u2019re not... you\u2019re not cold, or anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shakes his head, feeling like his heart is cracking in half. \u201cI feel totally normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great!\u201d Jeongguk says, his voice a little strained. He\u2019s smiling, although it doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me anymore!\u201d </p>\n<p>Except for Taehyung does need him, he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess not,\u201d he agrees, forcing himself to smile back. \u201cBut, I just wanted to say - thank you, so much. You literally saved my life this week, and I really - it means a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words are raw with emotion, and he aches to reach out and touch Jeongguk\u2019s face, but he can\u2019t - everything is different now, every action feels more weighted. He needs time to think, to sort through his feelings and figure out what this means for their relationship moving forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs. \u201cI\u2019ll always be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung smiles at him sadly, his eyes stinging with tears. He needs to get out of here before he completely loses it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh - I\u2019m gonna go shower, and stuff,\u201d he says hoarsely, rolling away from Jeongguk to hide his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can stay,\u201d Jeongguk offers, and Taehyung wants to die. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shakes his head, even though he wants nothing more than to stay, to curl up against Jeongguk\u2019s chest and stay there all day. \u201cI need to clear my head, I think. I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t look back when he leaves the room, afraid of what he might see on Jeongguk\u2019s face if he does.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Taehyung tells the boys the news that morning at breakfast, and everyone is thrilled. Seokjin looks like he might pass out from relief, having spent the better part of the last week fretting to anyone who would listen (mostly Namjoon) over whether it was his responsibility as the group hyung to force Taehyung to see a doctor.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk pastes a smile on and does his best to join in on the group\u2019s merriment, but it\u2019s a tall order when he feels like he might fall apart at any moment. He\u2019s furious with himself, because he knew this would happen, he <em>knew</em>, and yet he\u2019d let himself get caught up anyway. And now here he is, right back where he started, except for now that he\u2019s had a taste he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s ever going to be normal around Taehyung again. </p>\n<p>Mercifully, Jimin is the only one who seems to notice something\u2019s off with him, which honestly Jeongguk could have predicted. He keeps shooting worried looks at Jeongguk during breakfast, which Jeongguk pointedly ignores until Jimin literally corners him in his bedroom later that day.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he snaps when Jimin opens his mouth. Jimin raises an offended eyebrow at him, and Jeongguk sighs. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I don\u2019t really need to ask how you\u2019re doing, then,\u201d Jimin says, folding his arms across his chest.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk shrugs miserably. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault, I knew this would happen and I did it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself,\u201d Jimin says gently. \u201cYou were being a good friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk snorts derisively. \u201cYeah, going down on someone because you\u2019re thirsty for their cock is the hallmark of any good friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p>God, he hates himself right now. He\u2019d been so fucking stupid.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard you were good at it,\u201d Jimin offers, and Jeongguk\u2019s head snaps up so quickly he nearly breaks his neck. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flashes him a smug smile, wiggling his eyebrows. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d Jeongguk says disbelievingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, unfortunately, and I\u2019m traumatized,\u201d Jimin informs him. \u201cBut also very proud of you for taking that D like a champ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>,\u201d Jeongguk hisses, his face heating up. There\u2019s a swell of hope in his stomach though, because this means Taehyung had talked about him with Jimin. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s something, a confirmation that this past week really did happen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, so before you get all dejected and sulky, think about that,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cThis cause may not be as lost as you think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders droop as he thinks back to this morning, how quick Taehyung had been to leave the room, how he\u2019d barely even looked at Jeongguk when he did. \u201cI dunno, Jiminie,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cHe practically bolted after he told me this morning, and we haven\u2019t spoken since.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs. \u201cGive him a little time. I think this week was confusing for him, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk nods, because even though it\u2019s painful, he knows Jimin is right. After this week, some space would probably be good for both of them. </p>\n<p>So he gives Taehyung time, and he gives Taehyung space. They don\u2019t exactly avoid each other, but they\u2019re careful around each other, choosing their words and actions closely. The easiness that had always existed between them is gone, and Jeongguk thinks that\u2019s the worst part - his heart is shattered, but it kills him to feel like he\u2019s losing his best friend. </p>\n<p>Ironically, the best word Jeongguk can find to describe how he feels now is cold. He spends a lot of time lying awake in his bed, staring up at his ceiling and listening to sad music like some sort of teen movie cliche. He misses the warmth of Taehyung next to him every night, misses his aimless chatter and the press of his body. A few times, he slips and gets himself off to the memory of Taehyung\u2019s lips wrapped around his cock, his broken whimpers when Jeongguk had made him come. The way he had looked standing in the bathroom in Jeongguk\u2019s too-big shirt, streaked with Jeongguk\u2019s cum. It works like a charm, but every time he comes down from his orgasm he just feels guilty and empty. Cold.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t say it outright, but he thinks the other members probably notice something is off - Jeongguk knows he\u2019s being quieter than usual, and it\u2019s hard to miss that he and Taehyung aren\u2019t attached at the hip the way they had been even before the fortune cookie debacle. He catches Namjoon watching him curiously a few times, and Seokjin is extra maternal and affectionate, massaging Jeongguk\u2019s neck and fluffing his hair at least five times a day. Jimin hangs off of him more than usual, clinging to Jeongguk like some sort of real live security blanket. Even Yoongi is gentle with him, letting him off the hook even when he\u2019s grumpy or petulant.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Hoseok who ends up staging an actual intervention, after he walks in on Jeongguk lying facedown on his bed listening to Adele.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says, turning off the music. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask, but get your ass up. Impromptu dance practice, dance line only.\u201d</p>\n<p>So they get Jimin and go spend three hours in the studio, running through old choreography, refining some of the new stuff, and free styling to their favorite songs. It does help, and on the bright side Jeongguk is so exhausted that night that he ends up sleeping better than he has all week.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Taehyung appears at his bedroom door. He knocks, which is weird, but Jeongguk is so happy to see him that he doesn\u2019t even care. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, startled when he opens the door and finds Taehyung on the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Taehyung says shyly. He has his arms wrapped around himself, and on reflex, Jeongguk reaches for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, is it back?\u201d he asks worriedly, grabbing Taehyung\u2019s forearms and looking him up and down.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Taehyung says, and Jeongguk drops his hands quickly, embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbles, stepping back. \u201cOld habit, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Taehyung shakes his head, shuffling closer and wrapping his arms around Jeongguk. Jeongguk stills, stunned. \u201cI missed you this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk swallows, carefully hugging Taehyung back. It feels so good to hold him again. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d he chokes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to play Overwatch?\u201d Taehyung says into his shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung laughs. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not perfect, and there\u2019s still an ache in Jeongguk\u2019s chest that he\u2019s not sure how to fix, but at the very least it\u2019s better than the cold blankness he\u2019s been feeling all week.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The first week after the fortune cookie spell is broken is really, really difficult. Taehyung\u2019s whole body aches for Jeongguk, and more than once he stops halfway through walking to Jeongguk\u2019s room and forces himself to go back to his own. He knows that the space is important, not just for him but probably for Jeongguk as well, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. The one upside is that he gets a lot of time to think, to sort through everything that happened and piece together his feelings now that his body is his own again. He finds that he feels almost exactly the same as he had during that week - it\u2019s like some sort of dam has broken inside of him, and everything he\u2019d been holding back for so long is rushing forth.</p>\n<p>The second week is both easier and harder, because he and Jeongguk start easing back into the way things had been before the fortune cookie. It soothes the part of him that had missed Jeongguk so desperately, but it also makes him hungry for more. Taehyung is very much gone for his best friend, he knows this with total certainty now, but that doesn\u2019t resolve the minor issue of what the hell he\u2019s going to do about it. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should talk to him,\u201d Jimin says approximately once an hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been moping around like a kicked puppy all week,\u201d Yoongi chimes in, probably because Jimin put him up to it. \u201cPut the kid out of his misery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still, Taehyung balks. The prospect of coming clean to Jeongguk is daunting, especially when things are so fragile between them right now. He can\u2019t bear the thought of potentially driving Jeongguk away for good. </p>\n<p>That Sunday night, the seven of them pile into the rec room to watch a movie together. It\u2019s become something of a tradition on the Sundays when they\u2019re not working late and don\u2019t have to be up too early the following morning. They spread out around the room, Seokjin and Namjoon sprawled across the couch, Hoseok stretched out on the floor, Yoongi and Jimin folded up in one of the big arm chairs. Taehyung ends up accidentally on purpose sitting next to Jeongguk, and he curls into his side, resting his head on Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. This is always his favorite place to be when they watch movies. </p>\n<p>The movie is scary, and he spends the first half of it hiding in Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder, gripping his hand like a vise. He\u2019s too freaked out to think too much about whether he\u2019s pushing it by being so close to Jeongguk, until they pause the movie so that Yoongi can make popcorn, and suddenly he becomes very aware of the fact that they\u2019re holding hands. He chances a sideways glance at Jeongguk and finds him with wide eyes, staring hard at the place where their interwoven fingers rest on his thigh.</p>\n<p>Yoongi walks back into the room, bowl of popcorn in his arms, and his gaze falls on Taehyung and Jeongguk. \u201cDoes this mean you two finally sorted your shit out?\u201d he asks, looking pointedly at their hands.</p>\n<p>The room is suddenly very quiet, all eyes on Taehyung and Jeongguk. Jeongguk\u2019s cheeks stain pink, and he unlinks his fingers from Taehyung\u2019s, curling in on himself. \u201cI, umm,\u201d he mutters, avoiding everyone\u2019s gaze, including Taehyung\u2019s. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d He pushes himself up off the couch and vanishes into the hallway, his head ducked low.</p>\n<p>Jimin kicks Yoongi in the shin as soon Jeongguk leaves. </p>\n<p>\u201cOw!\u201d he yelps. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Jimin hisses.</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks disgruntled, rubbing his shin and glowering at Jimin. \u201cSorry, I thought -\u201d he turns to Taehyung. \u201cSorry, Tae.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone looks to Taehyung again, but he\u2019s too busy staring at the doorway that Jeongguk had left through to really notice. His side feels disappointingly cool where Jeongguk had been pressed up against him just a few minutes before.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung-ah,\u201d Namjoon says sharply, and Taehyung whips his head around, surveying the faces of the boys around him. They\u2019re all watching him expectantly, and his throat goes dry.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he says robotically.</p>\n<p>Hoseok looks like he\u2019s about to slap him. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo after him, you ass,\u201d Jimin cries, exasperated. He\u2019s managed to spread himself out over the whole chair so that Yoongi no longer has a place to sit down. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Taehyung says, leaping up from the couch. His heart is racing as he runs down the hallway, sliding into his own room briefly to grab something important before coming to a halt at Jeongguk\u2019s door. He pushes it open tentatively, not bothering to knock.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk is sitting cross-legged on his bed, his face in his hands. He looks so small and hunched that Taehyung wants to cry. \u201cI\u2019m <em>fine</em>, Jimin,\u201d he says when the door opens, sounding decidedly not fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Taehyung says softly, shutting the door behind him, and Jeongguk\u2019s head snaps up. His eyes are rimmed with a hint of red, like he\u2019s been fighting back tears, and Taehyung wants to fling himself across the room and wrap Jeongguk in his arms. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jeongguk says, composing himself and blinking rapidly. \u201cSorry.\u201d </p>\n<p>Taehyung hovers by the door, unsure of what to do with himself. \u201cJeongguk,\u201d he begins, forcing himself to speak. \u201cI, umm. I owe you a conversation, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to let me down easy, Tae,\u201d Jeongguk says hoarsely. He looks utterly miserable. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not -\u201d Taehyung shakes his head vehemently, taking one step into the middle of the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been kind of MIA these past few weeks. I just needed some time, after everything that happened, to clear my head, I guess. I didn\u2019t think it would be fair to talk to you before that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk just stares at him, his face unreadable, his arms crossed protectively over his chest.</p>\n<p>Taehyung clears his throat, soldiering on. \u201cI wasn\u2019t totally honest with you, about the fortune,\u201d he explains, pulling the slip of paper he had grabbed from his room out of his pocket. \u201cI want you to read it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He moves closer, extending his arm, and Jeongguk takes the fortune wordlessly, blinking down at it. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhere there is love, there is warmth,\u201d He reads aloud, and his voice catches. \u201cLove?\u201d he whispers, looking up at Taehyung with round eyes. </p>\n<p>Taehyung nods, shrugging helplessly. \u201cLooks like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Jeongguk says, his voice colored with disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have feelings for you,\u201d Taehyung replies, forcing himself to maintain eye contact even as his face flames. \u201cLike, big ones. The reason I got better - it\u2019s because I finally admitted it to myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He drops down on the bed next to Jeongguk, taking his hand. Jeongguk looks from Taehyung to their joined hands and back up again, his expression stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cTae,\u201d he says pleadingly, tugging his hand away. \u201cTae, please, I can\u2019t -\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung feels like he\u2019s been slapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to want me back,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI just - wanted to be honest with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t want you back,\u201d Jeongguk says flatly, shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you back for five fucking years, Tae.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung gapes at him, something exploding in the region of his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just, are you sure?\u201d Jeongguk asks, twisting his hands in his lap. \u201cLike, are you really fucking sure? Because I can\u2019t do this unless you are, Taehyung. I can\u2019t get my hopes up again, I won\u2019t survive it.\u201d His eyes are wild, desperate as they search Taehyung\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure,\u201d Taehyung says softly. \u201cHow could I - it\u2019s you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t - you didn\u2019t, before,\u201d Jeongguk protests weakly. Five years is a long fucking time, Taehyung realizes. It\u2019s a long time to harbor feelings you think are unreciprocated.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody wants you, Jeongguk,\u201d he says helplessly. It sounds like a stupid excuse, but it\u2019s true. \u201cYou\u2019re - Jesus, come on. I didn\u2019t think I stood a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSays the most handsome face of 2017,\u201d Jeongguk snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Taehyung says fiercely, grabbing his hands again. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you. I could keep it in check, before, but now that I know what it\u2019s like to have you - I can\u2019t, I\u2019m a lost cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jeongguk breathes, shaking his head. </p>\n<p>Now that he\u2019s started, Taehyung can\u2019t seem to stop. The words spill out of his mouth unbidden, everything he\u2019s been wanting to say for so long. \u201cI want to kiss you, and I want to touch you, not because my body needs it, but because I fucking <em>want</em> it, I want you more than anything.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jeongguk shudders, watching him with wide, wet eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk-ah,\u201d Taehyung pleads, his voice gentler now. \u201cDo you want to be with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like time stands still while he waits for Jeongguk\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jeongguk whispers. The word comes out like the exhale of a long-held breath. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo be with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and then Jeongguk nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s heart soars, smiling so wide he feels like his face might split in two. Jeongguk bites his lip, the corners of his mouth tugging upwards, and Taehyung can\u2019t help himself - he takes Jeongguk\u2019s face in his hands and kisses him senseless, until his smile lights up his entire face and they\u2019re both gasping for air.</p>\n<p>When they finally break apart, breathless, Taehyung rests his forehead against Jeongguk\u2019s, gripping the back of his head. Jeongguk is giggling almost uncontrollably, little half-laughs slipping from his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung says, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jeongguk says, shaking his head. \u201cI just am really happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Taehyung breathes, his heart swelling as he crushes their lips together again. He just wants to be touching Jeongguk always, everywhere, for the rest of his life. </p>\n<p>In pursuit of this noble goal, he crawls into Jeongguk\u2019s lap, straddling his hips as they continue to kiss. Jeongguk groans, immediately slipping his hands up and under Taehyung\u2019s shirt, fitting them around his waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it off,\u201d Taehyung urges him, lifting his arms up over his head so Jeongguk can rid him of his shirt. Jeongguk is back on him in an instant, hands skimming over the newly exposed skin as he sucks a mark into Taehyung\u2019s collarbone. Taehyung wants to give him everything.</p>\n<p>With one hand wrapped securely around Taehyung\u2019s waist, Jeongguk tips them backwards on to the bed, pulling away briefly to tug off his own shirt. Taehyung watches appreciatively as his chest comes into view, the muscles in his arms tensing as he tosses his shirt aside. His heart is racing, his mind fuzzy with desire, because he knows what he wants, now that Jeongguk is his.</p>\n<p>He reaches for Jeongguk, grabbing at the empty air between them, and Jeongguk comes willingly, stretching out over him. It feels like he\u2019s everywhere - mouthing along Taehyung\u2019s jaw, his neck, his bicep. One of his hands finds Taehyung\u2019s, lying beside his head on the pillow, and links their fingers together. His hips press Taehyung down into the mattress, hot and insistent, the feeling of Jeongguk\u2019s erection against his own making Taehyung see stars.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Tae, I want you so badly,\u201d Jeongguk whimpers when Taehyung pulls him in for another kiss. The words make Taehyung\u2019s head spin, and Jeongguk\u2019s eyes are darker than he\u2019s ever seen them when Taehyung pushes the hair back from his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d Taehyung murmurs, and Jeongguk surges forward again, kissing him harder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d Jeongguk says hoarsely, tipping his forehead against Taehyung\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll give you anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the hottest fucking thing he\u2019s ever heard, and Taehyung whines, fingers tugging at Jeongguk\u2019s hair. His heart is beating so hard he feels like it might explode out of his chest at any given moment. </p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to fuck me,\u201d he breathes, making sure to meet Jeongguk\u2019s gaze when he says it. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk chokes, his eyes fluttering shut. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Taehyung adds as an afterthought, and Jeongguk gasps out a disbelieving laugh. \u201cJeon Jeongguk,\u201d he continues. \u201cWould you please, kindly, fuck my brains out -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, shut up,\u201d Jeongguk groans, cutting him off with a kiss, and Taehyung laughs against his mouth. \u201cBut yes, I will, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have stuff?\u201d Taehyung asks, his stomach twisting with anticipation, and Jeongguk nods, blushing hard. He nearly falls over himself scrambling off the bed and over to his dresser, and if Taehyung weren\u2019t so beside himself right now he might have teased him for it.</p>\n<p>As it is, he settles for shimmying out of his pants and boxers, so that when Jeongguk turns back to him, he\u2019s lying naked on the bed, trying to look sexy and confident rather than embarrassed and nervous. Jeongguk promptly drops the lube and condom that he\u2019s holding, which makes Taehyung burst out laughing and does a bit to assuage his nerves.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk swears, ducking down to scoop them up, his face bright red when he pops back up. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re still sexy as hell, c\u2019mere,\u201d Taehyung says, reaching out for him, and Jeongguk comes, tossing the lube and condom on the bed so that he can kick off his own pants. </p>\n<p>Then they\u2019re both naked, and Jeongguk is sitting back on his heels before him, propping Taehyung\u2019s legs up. He presses a kiss to the inside of Taehyung\u2019s knee, and Taehyung wishes he was closer so that he could touch him. Jeongguk\u2019s hands are shaking as he squeezes the lube into his palm, his eyes wide when he grazes a finger over Taehyung\u2019s hole, pressing in tentatively.</p>\n<p>Taehyung yelps, squirming, and Jeongguk\u2019s eyes snap up to him, mortified.</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d Taehyung says soothingly before Jeongguk can start freaking out. \u201cKeep going. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>So he does, fingering Taehyung open carefully, and Taehyung does his best to keep his eyes open so that he can watch him. The stretch of each additional finger makes Taehyung shudder, his body taut and strung out when Jeongguk leans forward to kiss him. His breathing is ragged against Taehyung\u2019s lips, the kisses uneven and sloppy, but Taehyung gets it - Jeongguk is three fingers deep by now, and he suspects they\u2019re both wondering what it\u2019ll feel like when they\u2019re replaced with his cock.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Taehyung grits out when he doesn\u2019t think he can take it any longer. His body is coiled so tightly he feels like he\u2019s about to snap. </p>\n<p>Jeongguk pulls back to look at him, eyes widening when he sees the expression on Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asks, breathless. Taehyung nods fervently, and Jeongguk ducks down, kissing him again and again. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jeongguk</em>,\u201d Taehyung whines, wriggling against his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, sorry,\u201d Jeongguk says, dropping one last kiss to the corner of Taehyung\u2019s mouth before scrambling up to his knees. </p>\n<p>His hands are trembling so hard that he can\u2019t get the condom wrapper open, and really, Taehyung is so in love with him he can hardly stand it. He sits up, taking the package from Jeongguk (whose gaze flicks up to him gratefully) and tearing it open with his teeth, preening when Jeongguk\u2019s jaw literally drops. </p>\n<p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Taehyung says gently. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Jeongguk nods, inhaling deeply, and then hisses when Taehyung rolls the condom over his length. </p>\n<p>Taehyung cries out when Jeongguk presses inside of him, going achingly slowly to allow him time to adjust. He clutches at Jeongguk\u2019s back, finding purchase along the curve of his shoulder blades, and Jeongguk drops his head into the crook of Taehhyung\u2019s neck, breathing harsh.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he pants, when he\u2019s fully inside. </p>\n<p>\u201cMove,\u201d Taehyung murmurs into his ear, wrapping his legs around Jeongguk\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the most graceful sex anyone has ever had - it\u2019s their first time together, after all, and there\u2019s a learning curve to these things. Their noses bump together, and it takes some time to find the right rhythm, but it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s them, together, it\u2019s Jeongguk moving over him, inside of him, and that alone has Taehyung\u2019s head spinning. </p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t expecting them to last very long, and he\u2019s right, they don\u2019t. But Jeongguk does manage to wind their fingers together above Taehyung\u2019s head, catching Taehyung\u2019s moans in his mouth as he fucks into him. After a little while, Taehyung doesn\u2019t even bother trying to keep his voice down, because he wants Jeongguk to know exactly how good he makes him feel.</p>\n<p>He comes when Jeongguk gets a hand between them, jerking Taehyung off in time to his thrusts until he spills across their stomachs. Jeongguk follows not long after, with Taehyung\u2019s fingers in his hair, panting breathless encouragements into his ear. </p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Jeongguk says, once he\u2019s pulled out of Taehyung as gently as possible and collapsed at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cSame,\u201d Taehyung agrees, rolling on to his side so that he can nestle against Jeongguk\u2019s chest. He flattens his hand against Jeongguk\u2019s stomach, tracing patterns with his fingers. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to do that, like, five more times,\u201d Jeongguk says, and Taehyung snorts, propping his chin on Jeongguk\u2019s chest so that he can look up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly five?\u201d he teases, cheeky, and Jeongguk groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d he grumbles, twisting a finger in Taehyung\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would never,\u201d Taehyung laughs. \u201cAlthough death by sex doesn\u2019t sound like the worst way to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk makes a face at him and deliberately messes up his hair, pushing it down into his eyes. It\u2019s something he\u2019s done a million times before over the course of their friendship, and Taehyung\u2019s heart lurches when he thinks about it, how long they\u2019ve been dancing around each other. A part of him wishes they would have figured it out sooner, but he\u2019s also glad they have that foundation to build from. He already knows Jeongguk so well - now he just gets to love him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Taehyung says, his hair still hanging in his eyes. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears Jeongguk\u2019s sharp inhale, and then he\u2019s rushing to push Taehyung\u2019s hair back, so that Taehyung can see the radiant smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he breathes, like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s actually saying it out loud.</p>\n<p>Taehyung has never been so grateful for a stupid fortune cookie.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When all is said and done, they don\u2019t end up leaving Jeongguk\u2019s room until well into the following morning. They stay up late into the night, talking and laughing just like they always would have, except now Jeongguk can roll over and kiss Taehyung whenever he wants to, now he can say \u201cI love you\u201d and hear it said back to him. They also have sex again, and then again, and when Jeongguk wakes up the following morning to Taehyung\u2019s mouth wrapped around his cock, he thinks he may have actually died and gone to heaven.</p>\n<p>So, really, he can\u2019t even blame the boys when they walk into the kitchen hand in hand and are met with a wall of whoops and catcalls. </p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, have you two just been fucking for the past 14 hours?\u201d Namjoon asks, looking pointedly at Taehyung, who between his puffy pink lips and flushed cheeks looks positively debauched. Jeongguk feels a rush of smug, giddy pride and can\u2019t even manage to suppress his smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly for like, 12 of them,\u201d Taehyung says casually, and Jeongguk gags on his own spit.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod help us all,\u201d Hoseok mutters, at the same time Seokjin says, \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi clears his throat, shuffling over to them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about last night,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough it looks like it worked out for you two, so maybe I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, hyung,\u201d Jeongguk replies, smiling when Taehyung squeezes his hand.</p>\n<p>Jimin shoves Yoongi out of the way and flings himself at them, hooking one arm around each of their necks. Jeongguk is pretty sure his eyes are glistening.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you absolute shits,\u201d he mutters, but his voice is warm. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Jiminie,\u201d Taehyung laughs, as Jeongguk pats him on the back. </p>\n<p>And then... things pretty much just go back to normal. They can\u2019t be fully public about it yet, but that\u2019s probably for the best anyway, to maintain some semblance of privacy. Half the fans ship them together anyway, and it\u2019s not like they can\u2019t be affectionate with each other in public. Just no actual making out, and no blatantly obvious hickeys (which poses a bit of a challenge, but they get creative).</p>\n<p>In a lot of ways, things are exactly the same. The other members are no different around them, aside from the occasional wretching when they catch them being particularly lovey dovey, and Seokjin\u2019s vague obsession with taking couple\u2019s photos of them. They still stay up late playing Overwatch, they goof around during rehearsals and photo shoots, and Taehyung continues to make sculptures out of Jeongguk\u2019s hair when there\u2019s a lot of product in it. They\u2019re still best friends, which Jeongguk is exceptionally grateful for. </p>\n<p>In other ways, everything is different. He gets to share a bed with Taehyung every night, fall asleep to the sound of his breathing and wake up to him burrowed into his side. He gets to hold Taehyung\u2019s hand whenever he feels like it, just because he wants to, and not worry about whether it\u2019ll seem weird or too obvious. He gets to fuck him, in every way he had ever fantasized about and a lot more than that also, because they do have 5 years of time to make up for, after all. And he gets to love him, freely, openly, and without heartache or shame, and know that he\u2019s loved in return. That part is his favorite. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a night, maybe a month after they officially get together, when Jeongguk goes out to dinner with Jimin and Seokjin. Taehyung and the others stay behind, either not hungry or too tired from the day\u2019s work. The three of them get a little buzzed on soju, and end up in a snowball fight on their way home, which culminates in Seokjin pushing Jeongguk into a snow bank. All in all, by the time he gets back to the dorm, he\u2019s drenched, covered in snow and dripping freezing water. </p>\n<p>He discards his shoes and jacket by the front door and wanders to Taehyung\u2019s room without really thinking about it. He finds him curled up on his bed, messing around on his phone, but he looks up with a soft, sleepy smile when he sees Jeongguk.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, putting his phone down and drinking Jeongguk in. \u201cHow was - oh my god, you\u2019re soaked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk looks down at himself - he supposes his pants are still kind of wet from the snow. A drop of melting snow slips from his hair and lands on his cheek, making him wince.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeokjin hyung pushed me into a snow bank,\u201d he explains, shrugging. Taehyung raises his eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got my revenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am worried, because you\u2019re going to get a cold,\u201d Taehyung tuts, rolling off the bed to grab a towel from his closet. \u201cTake off your pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk quirks a suggestive eyebrow at him, grinning cheesily. </p>\n<p>\u201cBefore you freeze to death, you loser,\u201d Taehyung says, rolling his eyes. \u201cYour dick is probably the size of a peanut right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk gapes at him in mock horror. \u201cI think we both know that\u2019s not possible, Tae.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung snorts, but Jeongguk swears his ears go a little pink. \u201cWell, at least the size of your ego isn\u2019t in question,\u201d he says, holding out the towel. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grinning to himself, Jeongguk kicks off his pants and goes to sit beside Taehyung on his bed, sighing happily when Taehyung starts massaging his head with the towel.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez, did you burrow a tunnel through that snow bank?\u201d Taehyung teases, patting at Jeongguk\u2019s forehead before setting the towel aside. \u201cYou\u2019re so cold,\u201d he says with a frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan think of one way to get warm,\u201d Jeongguk hums, tugging Taehyung into his lap. He comes easily, straddling his thighs and looping his arms loosely around Jeongguk\u2019s neck. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Taehyung says playfully. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorked like a charm when you were the cold one,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs, sliding his hands under Taehyung\u2019s shirt and up his back. </p>\n<p>Taehyung shivers a little, smiling. \u201cYour hands are cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll just have to warm me up then,\u201d Jeongguk says, kissing his neck.</p>\n<p>Taehyung sighs contentedly. \u201cI think I\u2019m up to the challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>On one of the first truly hot days of the summer, they have an outdoor photo shoot, because of course. They\u2019re posing on a rooftop somewhere in Seoul, and the air is thick and sticky, the sun utterly unforgiving. It\u2019s a long day, and by the time they trudge back into the dorms, they\u2019re all grumpy, sweaty, and exhausted.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a wild clamor to see who will get to shower first, but Taehyung pulls away from the fray, recognizing a losing battle when he sees one. He grabs Jeongguk\u2019s wrist and tugs him along with him, effectively banishing his reluctance when he murmurs:</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we go later, we can shower together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk comes willingly after that. </p>\n<p>They end up in the kitchen, and Taehyung roots around in the freezer until he finds what he\u2019d been looking for. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave I mentioned lately that I love you,\u201d Jeongguk says when he straightens up holding a box of fruit-flavored popsicles. </p>\n<p>\u201cFeel free to tell me again and again,\u201d Taehyung grins, tossing Jeongguk a blue raspberry before tearing open the package of a cherry flavor.</p>\n<p>The popsicle is deliciously sweet and cold on his tongue, the perfect refreshment after such a hot, disgusting day. He makes a bit of a show of moaning while he eats it, dragging his tongue lasciviously along the side while Jeongguk glowers at him with increasingly dark eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cCan you not,\u201d Jeongguk huffs, when Taehyung hollows out his cheeks and lets out a particularly filthy noise.</p>\n<p>Taehyung beams at him cheekily, finishing off his popsicle and dropping the stick in the trash. \u201cBe nice and maybe I\u2019ll do that to you in the shower later.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jeongguk quite literally growls at him, and Taehyung lives for this, that they\u2019ve been having sex for five whole months and he can still so easily get Jeongguk to react to him this way. It\u2019s the biggest ego boost in the world, not to mention really fucking hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Jeongguk grumbles, but it\u2019s hard to take him seriously when his mouth is stained blue from the popsicle.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just said you love me,\u201d Taehyung points out, sidling up to him with a shit-eating grin. Jeongguk rolls his eyes, but Taehyung ignores him, opting instead to cup his cheeks and kiss him. His lips are cool and taste of blue raspberry.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Jeongguk asks.</p>\n<p>Taehyung smiles at him fondly, linking their fingers together.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour lips were blue.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>FIN</p>"
