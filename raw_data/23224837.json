  "notes": "<p>Hey! Well, here I am in a fandom I don\u2019t belong in, ignoring the WIP that\u2019s been hanging over my head for two years. I\u2019m sorry? But also I couldn\u2019t help myself. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world right now, and most of it is scary and stressful. If I can even make one of you smile today, I\u2019ll count myself lucky. </p>\n<p>Please, join me. I have only ever seen the Netflix show, and from just the premise you can probably tell this takes wild liberties with Jaskier and Yen\u2019s backstory, but here we are. All mistakes are my own, though shout out to bioluminescent for pointing out a couple spelling errors.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s it! I want you to imagine Ciri, patiently coaching Geralt through all of his emotional moments with Jaskier. This kid put up with so much. Anyway, I may or may not add an epilogue in a few days. Thanks for reading!</p>",
  "text": "<p>Jaskier the Bard was a noble once, or so the story goes. A disgraced only child of a Viscount, who grew frivolous in luxury, and became so spoiled that he ran away from his duties. His poor family, the rumors cry, had no choice but to disown him. Jaskier the Bard, they say, gave up his privilege, went to find himself, because some part of him always knew that the world needed stories and he was destined to be their teller. And so he left and wandered and sang, and the world was the better for it, even as a Viscount mourned his only son.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a very pretty story. In fact, it may be the prettiest story Jaskier\u2019s ever fabricated. </p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>When Jaskier was thirteen, his mother handed him a coin purse and told him to run. To run, and never look back.</p>\n<p>He was thirteen, and still going by Julian. He was the youngest of four (five) siblings, and the most troublesome. He had never met a disaster he didn\u2019t exacerbate or a song he didn\u2019t sing late into the night. When he was younger, much younger, it was sweet. When he grew older, and his music began to ensnare\u2026</p>\n<p>His mother handed him a coin purse and rested a hand on the side of his face. The other side was bruised and scraped, his eye near swollen shut. \u201cYou must run. Before what happened to your sister happens to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked at his mother, with eyes he had begun to realize were too blue, too different. \u201cI\u2019ll find her, Mama.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRun, Julian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier ran. He was two towns away by nightfall, and he outpaced the man that was not his father after all.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>When Jaskier was four, he gathered a bouquet of dandelions from the fields. He was a strange child even then, flighty and musical, always humming and laughing and dancing. He liked bright things and shiny things and people watching him, paying attention to him. He had one older brother and two (three) older sisters, but they never wanted to play. He loved them nonetheless. That was the main thing about Jaskier, that confused so many. He loved. He loved fiercely and broadly and freely. </p>\n<p>As youngest, the man he thought his father didn\u2019t notice him much. And despite his constant noise and motion, he was a normal enough child, to his mother\u2019s secret relief. </p>\n<p>But when Jaskier was four, he slipped his mother\u2019s watch and went to the field to gather a bouquet of dandelions. He climbed back into the yard, as stealthy as a child really cared to be, and crept over to the barn. In the barn, lived a secret. (The man he thought his father said the secret was a monster, a plague. His mother said the secret was his sister.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jaskier whispered through the crack in the barn door. \u201cMama telled me you were sad. But you shouldn\u2019t be sad, \u2018cause I love ya.\u201d </p>\n<p>He slid the dandelions under the door. He just barely saw a pale hand, caked with dirt, reach out to take them.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>His father, his <em>real</em> father, died before Jaskier was born, in what they called the Great Cleansing. His mother was already married, to an altogether odious man, who she had already bore three children. When her first love appeared in the fields one midsummer night as if by magic, she was drawn back to him, like a moth to a flame. For one night, she was happy.</p>\n<p>Nine months later, she held Jaskier in her arms, his eyes a bright, electric blue, and was grateful, so grateful, that she could pass him off as fully human. He had a chance, unlike her firstborn. He had a chance, and a mercifully straight spine.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me a story! Tell me a story!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe quiet. You shouldn\u2019t even be out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPleaseeeee? Just one story and I\u2019ll go \u2018way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Once upon a time, there was a princess. She was not beautiful, like the other princesses, or smart. But she was strong, even though she suffered under a <em>horrible</em> curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kinda curse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe night she was born, an evil monster placed a curse on her so that she could never leave the castle tower, until she was loved, truly and deeply. But the monster didn\u2019t stop there. It cursed her to be unlovable. As soon as someone saw her, they would be repulsed and hate her on the spot. She would live out the rest of her life unlovable, and because she was unlovable, trapped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a happy ending, right? Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime passed, and the princess spoke to no one, and no one spoke to her. One day, a young prince was wandering the castle when he came across a locked door. He had never found a locked door in the castle before. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Hello, is anyone in there?\u2019 He said, knocking. </p>\n<p>\u2018\u2019\u2019Yes,\u2019 said the princess. She hadn\u2019t talked to anyone in two years. </p>\n<p>\u2018\u2019\u2019Would you like to come outside and play with me?\u2019 Asked the young prince. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019I cannot,\u2019 said the princess. \u2018I am trapped in this room forever. You would not want to play with me anyway, if you could see me.\u2019 But the little prince did not like that answer and he did not understand how long forever was meant to be.</p>\n<p>\u2018\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ll come back tomorrow so that we can play.\u2019 And the young prince came back day after day, and asked each time if the princess would come out and play. Each time she said no. One day, when he approached the locked door, he heard her crying. Instead of asking her to play, he ran outside and collected a bouquet of flowers. He slid it under her door. \u2018Please don\u2019t be sad. Even if you can\u2019t play with me, I love you.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the curse broke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the curse broke. The princess stopped crying, threw open the locked door and left the castle forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about the prince?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Well, she gave the prince a dandelion from her bouquet, and tucked it right behind his ear. \u2018Thank you for freeing me, little prince. Once I explore the world, I will come back for you, and we will leave this castle forever.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they lived happily ever after?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, she lived happily ever after. Now go back inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKay. Good night, Yen. I love you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, little dandelion.\u201d</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t find her. He searches for Yennefer, searches and searches, but he only hears rumors of court mages and powers beyond his understanding. He only sings, a bit. He probably couldn\u2019t get close enough to a mage to even ask after his sister, so he decides on the next best thing. He\u2019ll become someone, loudly, proudly, and his sister will come to him. Just like the princess comes back for the prince, she\u2019ll find him once she\u2019s explored the world.</p>\n<p>Until then, he\u2019ll start living.</p>\n<p>He goes to Oxenfurt, as Julian Alfred Pankratz. He studies histories and poems and music, until the talent that came naturally as a child, that ensnared all who heard him is refined, is art. He teaches for a while, has a dedicated bunch of students, but by the time he\u2019s forty years old he looks in the mirror and sees the same face he always has. There are no wrinkles, no gray hairs, and he abruptly remembers that he is magic. He is magic and he is not aging. He is magic and he cannot stay. </p>\n<p>Julian Alfred Pankratz makes a name for himself, is well known throughout the continent, and yet Yen never comes. She must be dead. She must be, or else she would never leave him like this. The princess promised the prince.</p>\n<p>Fine. That\u2019s fine. He hasn\u2019t seen his sister in more than thirty years. He can\u2019t stay at Oxenfurt and never age, and there\u2019s something stifling about it besides. He was a child of music and motion, and he thinks it\u2019s time that he becomes that person again.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Jaskier sings Julian Alfred Pankratz out of existence. He scribbles in his notebook for a few hours, working out the feel and the intention of his spell. He doesn\u2019t understand his magic, not really, and he never has. But when he finally picks up his lute, and <em>sings</em>, he knows he\u2019s gotten it right.</p>\n<p>\n<em>So every man dies, so every man falls,</em><br>\n<em>Even that Julian Alfred Pankratz!</em><br>\n<em>A legend in courts, so sung in all halls,</em><br>\n<em>Yet none can remember his face! Perhaps-</em><br>\n<em>He fell down a well, or lay down in bed</em><br>\n<em>With a pretty little thing in his lap!</em><br>\n<em>His songs, they live on, but know that he\u2019s dead,</em><br>\n<em>That poor fool Julian Alfred Pankratz!</em>\n</p>\n<p>The next morning, he leaves a mourning Oxenfurt behind and takes to the road.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Jaskier sings and travels and falls in love with everyone he meets just a little. And then in a shitty little tavern in Posada, he finds a Witcher. Jaskier decides to keep him.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, you must want something for yourself once all this monster hunting nonsense is over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, who knows? Maybe someone out there will want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need no one. And the last thing I want is someone needing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet here we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>After Cintra, and the mess of the Child Surprise, Jaskier wanders on his own for a while. He doesn\u2019t quite know what he\u2019s doing. Before the party, when Jaskier was leaning over Geralt\u2019s bath, he realized something. Something he should have realized quite a long time ago. He\u2019s in love with the damned Witcher. And Jaskier will have to leave him, when it becomes obvious that he doesn\u2019t age, that despite almost a decade as friends, traveling the world together, Jaskier looks the same as he did in that tavern in Posada. How much longer before Geralt suspects? The barbarian might act like he has more muscles than brains, but if Geralt ever puts his mind to it, simply <em>thinks</em> about how much time Jaskier has followed at his heels\u2026 well.</p>\n<p>After the Child Surprise and the mess of Cintra, Jaskier wanders, tries to put distance between the Witcher and his Bard. And, failing, comes back to Geralt again and again, for drowners and kikimores and ghouls. He sings \u2018Toss a Coin\u2019 in front of backwater taverns and village crowds. He writes ballad after ballad, and watches Geralt over the fire on nights they camp in the woods.</p>\n<p>Jaskier watches and <em>wants</em>, so badly that it knocks him breathless some nights.</p>\n<p>He was a child of music and motion and love. Now, somewhere in his fifth decade, more has stayed the same as not. </p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>In Rinde, Jaskier finds Geralt in the woods, fishing for a djinn. Jaskier is magic and music, but ultimately untrained. Something in his gut, however, tells him that this is bad, bad, bad. All the poems and histories he\u2019s ever read ascribe to djinns to tragedies. </p>\n<p>So maybe he gets distracted for a moment when Geralt calls his voice fillingless pie. His music keeps him alive, thank you very much, and he can ensnare any number of people close enough to listen. He can alter the fabric of reality with his music! Literally sing people out existence. Stupid Geralt of Rivia has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. </p>\n<p>\u201cTake it back about my fillingless pie.\u201d He grabs the djinn\u2019s container, and he can feel the magic around it. So perhaps it\u2019s partly his fault what happens next. The wind in the trees, and his meaningless wishes simply because he wants to stop the tragedy before it begins. The magic doesn\u2019t snap to him, doesn\u2019t give any hint of obeying. It doesn\u2019t make <em>sense</em>.</p>\n<p>Geralt snarls, golden eyes flashing far closer than Jaskier was expecting. It\u2019s a very inconvenient time to be turned on, but- \u201cI just want some damn peace!\u201d</p>\n<p>Faintly, oh so faintly, Jaskier feels something click in the djinn\u2019s magic.</p>\n<p>Oh, fuck.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Jaskier, for all that he throws himself into danger at the drop of a hat, can count on one hand the number of times he\u2019s truly been afraid. When Yen was taken, when his apparent step-father found out the truth, that banquet in Cintra when he wasn\u2019t sure he or Geralt would make it out. And now, coughing blood, unable to help himself because he can\u2019t sing, Geralt dragging him along. Jaskier is afraid. Afraid he\u2019ll die, or never sing again which might as well be the same.</p>\n<p>If he stops working magic, does that mean he\u2019ll start aging?</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not even in the right frame of mind to appreciate all of Geralt\u2019s manhandling! Jaskier has so many witty remarks to make about Geralt throwing him over his shoulder, about his actual <em>concern</em>. Geralt has never initiated this much physical contact before. It\u2019s always Jaskier draping himself over the Witcher, washing his hair, leaning against his side. Unfortunately, Jaskier\u2019s a little too busy dying to appreciate anything.</p>\n<p>Then Geralt drops him in an orgy, while he talks to a vaguely menacing woman in a black dress. Jaskier can\u2019t hear their conversation over his wheezing, or see much of her beyond the mask. Then he sees nothing at all.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Jaskier wakes confused, with only a slight tightness in his throat. There\u2019s a woman with dark hair sitting at the end of the bed, and Geralt is nowhere in sight. He doesn\u2019t remember falling asleep, or fucking whoever this is.</p>\n<p>When the woman turns around, half-undressed with near glowing violet eyes, Jaskier feels a bit of the fog clear. Nope, definitely did not sleep with her. Something about her seems vaguely familiar, but very much not in the scorned lover way. Just the thought of sex with this extremely attractive woman turns his stomach. Nope, apparently just an evil witch.</p>\n<p>He stumbles out of bed, and she follows, stalking after him. Where the fuck is Geralt? </p>\n<p>\u201cExpress your deepest desires and you can be on your way,\u201d she says, and the robe is just\u2026 showing everything. Even her voice seems familiar. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell my deepest desires are currently satisfied, thank you so much.\u201d Before he can pull on his boots, her magic pushes him against the door. Again, he should repeat, where the fuck is Geralt? Jaskier might be magic, but he would rather not reveal that, thanks, and he has so little training that this woman is sure to wipe the floor with him.</p>\n<p>And then, she asks him to\u2026 sing?</p>\n<p>Well, if this sorceress is going to literally ask him to do magic, who is he to protest. \u2018Toss a Coin\u2019 has gained enough popularity, become rooted deeply enough in the public mind that it\u2019s practically a bludgeoning weapon. He should be able to buy himself some time. \u201c<em>Toss a coin to your Witcher, o Valley of</em>- penis. Oh god.\u201d The magic twists away before he can make it do anything in particular.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knife far too close to something Jaskier would really prefer not to lose, and a smile on the witch\u2019s lips. \u201cNever mind. Was that magic? Does your Witcher know you have magic?\u201d Those violet eyes have lost a bit of the coldness to curiosity. Why does she seem so familiar?</p>\n<p>\u201cMagic, I ha- have no idea what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d</p>\n<p>She sends him flying across the room. Great. Amazing. Where the fuck is Geralt?</p>\n<p>\u201cMake your wish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier spits out a meaningless wish and runs. Geralt is there, which is very nice, and he even seems to be happy that Jaskier is alive, but they need to <em>leave</em>. Crazy witch woman is planning something very bad according to the magic in the air, and familiarity or not Jaskier would like to live.</p>\n<p>So, of course, Geralt runs back inside. And the entire top floor collapses. Jaskier is just about to start composing a song to raise Geralt from the dead <em>fuck him if he thinks he\u2019s getting away that easily</em> when the elf pulls him to the window. And he will never unsee that now, Geralt and the strangely familiar, crazy fucking witch. Great. He needs to scrub his eyes out with soap.</p>\n<p>When Geralt finally <em>wakes up</em> (how is this his life?), they don\u2019t stop traveling until the next town. Jaskier can\u2019t stop touching his throat, and feeling vaguely put out that Geralt abandoned him after his near-death experience to fuck an insane person. Whatever. He makes Geralt pay for the ale, and gods have mercy he actually does it without shooting Jaskier a dirty look. Someone must be feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs a little. A brooding Witcher is fun for no one. Time to push down his stupid jealousy and get the rest of the tale for his next ballad.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, who was the crazy witch?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something almost like a smile hovering around Geralt\u2019s mouth. Jaskier tries not to feel bitter. \u201cHer name was Yennefer, Yennefer of Vengerburg.\u201d</p>\n<p>Choking on ale <em>hurts</em> when your throat is recovering from a magical injury.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>The first time Jaskier runs into Yen after Rinde, he\u2019s eating a sad breakfast of gruel in a grimy tavern. She kicks out the seat next to him, and wrinkles her nose at Jaskier\u2019s bowl. Her deep purple dress hugs her curves, and the material of her cloak is fine enough that Jaskier\u2019s doublet looks embarrassing in comparison. Whatever. Some of them have far less biddable magical powers and a human reputation to protect, thank you very much. </p>\n<p>Geralt is nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, <em>bard</em>,\u201d Yennefer sneers. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier grits his teeth. \u201cCrazy witch, what a pleasant surprise. Don\u2019t you have orgies to instigate? Innocent villagers to burn to ashes? Beings of infinite power to foolishly sacrifice yourself to?\u201d</p>\n<p>A flash of annoyance in violet eyes. Jaskier scoops a dramatic spoonful of gruel, and twists his face into the mockery of a smile. When Geralt said her name, all those months ago, his first instinct after he finished choking on ale was to sprint back to Rinde. Yen was <em>alive</em>. After all these years, he and Yen could be together again, the prince and the princess freed from the castle at last. Then reality knocked those thoughts out of his head.</p>\n<p>Yen was alive. And she had been, all this time. Clearly her little brother meant nothing to her after all. The princess never came back for the prince, never even cared to wonder what had happened to the little boy who loved her. Who picked her bouquets of dandelions and listened to her stories and told her she was beautiful. If she never gave a damn about him, then fuck it, she doesn\u2019t deserve to know that he\u2019s alive. And to top it off, she slept with his Witcher!</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, Jaskier might love his sister, but at the moment he doesn\u2019t like her very much. At least the feeling is mutual.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019ll have to wait, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She sighs, tone regretful but her eyes vicious. \u201cI\u2019m far too tired right now, bard. The White Wolf kept me up all night, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to sleep yet. After all that exertion, I\u2019m simply <em>famished</em>.\u201d Yen pulls a bright red apple from her pocket. She sinks her teeth into the skin the same color as her lips.</p>\n<p>Jaskier is the one who gave Geralt that name. Is he really so obvious in his affection that someone who met him once can use it as a weapon? Under the indignation, Jaskier tries very hard to ignore the jealousy, and the heartbreak. Geralt isn\u2019t his. He knows this.</p>\n<p>He still didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d lose Geralt to his own sister.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Jaskier, noble lady.\u201d He makes the motions of a bow without rising. \u201cI am but a dandelion to your magnificent rose. Alas, at least I may be loved without savaging the hands of my sweet.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s eyes widen, over-large. \u201cOh apologies, I forget that you\u2019ve likely never had a chance to draw blood at all!\u201d</p>\n<p>One of Yennefer\u2019s finely sculpted eyebrows twitches. At least Jaskier knows that she\u2019s still vulnerable to his dubious charm. \u201cIf I never draw blood, it is only because no one dare claim ownership over me. You must know no one loves a weed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ouch. Jaskier doesn\u2019t let his smile falter, and his next words are a bit more vicious than they should be. \u201cPatently false. If nothing else, I can attest to the love of my father, who mourns even now that his son left him to seek fame elsewhere. I\u2019m sure your father was aching to be rid of a viper like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier regrets the words as soon as he\u2019s spoken them. It\u2019s a low-blow, and a blatant lie besides. Their \u2018father\u2019 was all too eager to rid himself of the both of them.</p>\n<p>Jaskier may be frozen, but Yen <em>snarls</em>. In the next moment, Jaskier finds himself unable to speak.</p>\n<p>Panic washes everything out. He can\u2019t breathe for remembering the djinn, remembering blood in his mouth, remembering fear. It takes a moment to realize that it doesn\u2019t hurt, and by that point Yennefer has leaned in close to hiss in his ear. \u201cIf you won\u2019t watch your fool tongue, I\u2019ll take it from you. And considering that I drowned my \u2018father' in his own blood, I don\u2019t think his opinion matters very much.\u201d She stands. Jaskier\u2019s throat still refuses to make a sound. \u201cGoodbye for now, bard. I have a Witcher to keep in bed all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier spends all day and night unable to say a word. He maybe deserves it a little.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>The second time Yen interrupts his breakfast, Jaskier is a bit more prepared. He\u2019s not prepared for Geralt to trail after her, for all three of them to sit at a single dingy table. Yen smiles at him with something vicious in her eyes, and presses tight against Geralt\u2019s side. </p>\n<p>\u201cHere, <em>darling</em>, let me get you something a bit more\u2026 edible,\u201d she purrs, lightly dragging her nails over Geralt\u2019s hand. She summons two plates of breakfast, steaming, for both her and Geralt. Jaskier wants to scream.</p>\n<p>His only saving grace is that Geralt looks as confused by her behavior as he does tentatively pleased. The Witcher clenches his jaw, brow furrowing. \u201cThanks.\u201d He finally settles on, and begins inhaling the contents of his plate.</p>\n<p>\u201cWitch.\u201d Jaskier says. He hopes the venom is audible.</p>\n<p>It must be, because Yen offers him a truly nasty smile. \u201cBard.\u201d She pointedly does not offer Jaskier any breakfast. The gruel tastes like ashes on his tongue. They don\u2019t snap at each other like the last time, since it feels almost\u2026 wrong with Geralt present. But even the Witcher can\u2019t be oblivious to the sheer ice in their eyes. If Geralt notices, he chooses not to acknowledge it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to get moving. Head to the next town,\u201d Geralt clears his plate. He looks at Yen, who is still pressed against his side, with something almost soft in his eyes. Jaskier bites back a flinch. That\u2019s <em>his</em> look, Geralt isn\u2019t supposed to look at anyone else like that! \u201cYou coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLife on the road, sleeping in the dirt?\u201d Yen scoffs. \u201cI\u2019ll see you off, Witcher, but nothing more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt almost sounds disappointed.</p>\n<p>Jaskier seethes to himself, but keeps quiet. He doesn\u2019t want Yen to change her mind.</p>\n<p>Outside, Jaskier helps Geralt saddle Roach, grateful that the mare doesn\u2019t nip at him anymore. He wormed his way into her heart, just like he did with Geralt, and Yen must be mad if she thinks he\u2019ll go quietly. He\u2019d never hurt his sister, not really, but Jaskier is creative. He has years of sibling torture to catch up on. As Yen yanks Geralt down into a searing kiss, he starts composing a tune. He\u2019ll sing it the first chance he gets, and see how his sister likes a little revenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cBard.\u201d She smirks, and Jaskier almost doesn\u2019t see the twitch of her other hand. A localized gust of wind catches him mid-step and he stumbles. For a brief moment, he thinks that he\u2019s caught himself, but then he\u2019s falling back into one of the troughs lining the stable.</p>\n<p>His only salvation is that it\u2019s one for water rather than food. His doublet and trousers are immediately soaked through, but at least they\u2019ll dry. Jaskier spits out his mouthful of water, coughing, and scrambles back to his feet.</p>\n<p>Geralt is\u2026 Geralt is laughing. Just a little, just the hint of a deep rumble, almost too quiet for Jaskier to hear, but there nonetheless. A bit of wet cloth is worth it for that. Yen offers Jaskier a cheeky little wave, before stepping through a portal and vanishing.</p>\n<p>Fine, walking beside Roach in dripping clothes isn\u2019t particularly comfortable. But Geralt seems almost\u2026 lighter, and as much as Jaskier\u2019s chest aches, he won\u2019t begrudge him that. Especially since, as the day starts to darken and Jaskier begins to shiver in earnest, Geralt pulls him up onto Roach. His Witcher is a line of heat down his back. When he wobbles a little, Geralt wraps an arm around his waist to steady him and leaves it there. Yen can\u2019t take this away from him.</p>\n<p>Despite his cooling anger, Jaskier still runs off for some alone time that night as Geralt sets up camp. The words come easily, a jaunty enough tune.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yennefer of Vengerburg,</em><br>\n<em>Fairest of the fair.</em><br>\n<em>Trick a bard into a trough,</em><br>\n<em>Prepare to lose your hair.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your luscious locks, they shall return,</em><br>\n<em>Though now they change to gray.</em><br>\n<em>You look your age. Be grateful,</em><br>\n<em>It\u2019ll only last a day.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jaskier falls asleep with a smile.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>The third time he runs into Yennefer, he\u2019s not even traveling with Geralt. Jaskier has found a court to winter in and build up some coin, while the Witcher retreats to his mysterious stronghold in the mountains that he won\u2019t take Jaskier to. It\u2019s fine, everything\u2019s fine, he\u2019s clearly not bitter at all. So when he spots Yen commanding the attention of the room in a lacy black dress, he sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWitch,\u201d Jaskier greets, after he joins her leaning against a pillar. There\u2019s something deeply traumatizing about the fact that three-quarters of this ballroom is fantasizing about fucking his sister. Deeply, deeply traumatizing. </p>\n<p>\u201cBard.\u201d She sounds dangerous, but less sharp than before. Jaskier decides to tone down his viciousness in kind.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for Geralt, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve come to the wrong place. The monosyllabic oaf abandons me every year for the winter,\u201d Jaskier places a hand over his heart. \u201cEvery year he leaves me to starve and wither away unless some poor court takes pity on me. He\u2019s been lucky to find me alive every spring, I tell you. My material becomes a bit repetitive after a few months, but thankfully this crowd is too drunk to remember what I\u2019ve sung in the morning. I tell you, I live a hard-\u201d</p>\n<p>A hand clamps over his mouth. \u201cDear Melitele, do you normally speak this much when you aren\u2019t busy glaring a hole in the side of my head?\u201dJaskier considers. He nods with her hand still covering his mouth. Yen rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, be silent before I make you.\u201d She takes her hand away.</p>\n<p>Jaskier considers bombarding her with a stream of words just to be contrary, but he knows she can back up her threat. For all that he jokes, his position in this court is very much based on whether he can sing. His stomach won\u2019t take kindly to emptiness were he to lose his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy <em>are</em> you here, if not for Geralt?\u201d </p>\n<p>She glares at him half-heartedly. \u201cWhat makes you think I have any interest in joining him in whatever\u2026 hovel he\u2019s holed up in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>oh</em>. You can\u2019t get to him can you?\u201d Jaskier grins. \u201cHis witchery cave that he disappears to is <em>warded</em> isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the gods, you\u2019re annoying,\u201d Yen mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI get that a lot.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier hadn\u2019t noticed before, but she\u2019s been subtly herding him out of the room, somewhere more private. Is she about to kill him? That would make a nice ballad\u2014a tragic story of fratricide. </p>\n<p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Yen tells him, when they\u2019ve left the party behind.</p>\n<p>Jaskier coughs. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would prefer the Witcher, but you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d She raises an eyebrow. \u201cYour magic is good for more than petty little party tricks, I assume?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRude! Absolutely rude and not the way to go about asking for help at all,\u201d Jaskier starts. \u201cYou are really quite bad at this whole making friends bit. I suppose you\u2019re like Geralt that way. Is that why you two keep fucking? Does your prickliness somehow attract each other? I swear, he calls my voice \u2018fillingless pie\u2019 and you call my wonderful, powerful, <em>reality-altering magic</em> a party trick. That\u2019s it, I\u2019ve decided you\u2019re made for each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yen pinches the bridge of her nose in a strangely familiar gesture. The girl he\u2019d known once, the sister he\u2019d adored\u2014 she\u2019d done the same thing when Jaskier had been a little too much. \u201cThis was a mistake. I\u2019m not trying to be your friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad, I think our resentful, ballad-worthy hatred has gone on for long enough. We can still be mean to each other, but we\u2019re friends now.\u201d Jaskier decides.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust do a job for me and I\u2019ll give you coin.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe best of friends.\u201d Jaskier is smart enough not to sling an arm around her shoulders, like he does with Geralt.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>The \u2018job\u2019 is far more suited to another magic user than a Witcher. Besides, Geralt has weirdly strong morals and would probably at least question why they were robbing a lord\u2019s keep. Jaskier shrugs and acts as the distraction he\u2019d promised.</p>\n<p>Yen\u2019s face, when she exits with whatever treasure she was here for and sees Jaskier\u2019s solution, is <em>priceless</em>. There is something otherworldly about an entire keep worth of guards getting beat senseless by their own armor. Jaskier is rather proud of this one. Another guard shrieks and drops as a pair of vambraces launch a helmet into his groin.</p>\n<p>When Yen finally drags Jaskier through a portal, she\u2019s muttering under her breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! I did exactly what you asked!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of spell was that?\u201d The whites around her eyes are starting to become a bit alarming. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have been possible, that was an entire small army\u2019s worth of armor to enchant. You should be dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier scoffs. \u201cI don\u2019t use spells. That\u2019s boring.\u201d</p>\n<p>The expression on Yen\u2019s face says she would dearly love to strangle to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you even human?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier winks. \u201cAs human as you, my dear!\u201d</p>\n<p>She throws the bag of gold at his head hard enough to hurt.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>By the time he runs into Yen again, it\u2019s been more than a year and he misses her. If she spends any time in Geralt\u2019s bed, she\u2019s always gone by morning. Apparently seeing his sister again is enough to awaken all his old longing for her company. At least he has Geralt to distract him. They travel the continent in search of monsters and Jaskier writes song after song.</p>\n<p>Once a year, Jaskier slips away to Cintra and sings a blessing at Princess Cirilla\u2019s birthday feast. If Geralt won\u2019t take responsibility for his Child Surprise, Jaskier can at least make sure she\u2019s safe. </p>\n<p>Things are quite normal otherwise, so he\u2019s taken off-guard to open his eyes and find Geralt on top of him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYen! Yen, I need you,\u201d Geralt shouts. He\u2019s clutching something in one hand. A rock? Jaskier can admit that of all the times he\u2019s fantasized about Geralt on top of him, he\u2019s never been calling out his sister\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>\u201cG\u2019ralt?\u201d Jaskier tries to ask. His tongue is surprisingly clumsy. He coughs once, and tastes blood in the back of his throat. Geralt stops shouting out someone else\u2019s name, and turns all that glorious attention onto Jaskier. Those eyes. He needs to write another ballad about those eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier. Stay still.\u201d Geralt\u2019s voice rumbles through him. The hand clutching the rock is covered in red. Blood? Is Geralt hurt? He tries to sit up, and pain rips through him. He collapses backward. Oh. \u201cDammit Jaskier! Stop. Moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lifts his head up enough to look down his body, and oh, oh that isn\u2019t pleasant. Geralt\u2019s other hand seems to be trying to keep his insides, well, inside. Jaskier absolutely doesn\u2019t remember how they got here. He tries to think of lyrics. What could he sing to knit himself back together? But everything is foggy and slow. He can\u2019t make his brain work. He\u2019s going to die.</p>\n<p>\u201cG\u2019ralt-\u201d Jaskier forces his mouth to work. If he\u2019s going to die, then he needs to make his last words worth it.</p>\n<p>Over the blood pounding in his ears, he hears a furious wind, and Geralt whips his head around. Jaskier wants to cry. Is it too much to ask to have Geralt\u2019s undivided attention as he dies?</p>\n<p>\u201cThis better be important, I was in the middle of-\u201d Yen! That\u2019s Yen\u2019s voice. Oh good, he can have his whole family here as he goes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYen. Help him. Please.\u201d Geralt\u2019s voice sounds\u2026 rough. Like he\u2019s gargled rocks. Maybe he\u2019s hurt after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d Yen\u2019s face is suddenly in front of his own. Her eyes have always been so pretty too. Why does everyone he loves have such pretty eyes? \u201cGeralt you need to let go.\u201d Geralt says something Jaskier can\u2019t quite make out. \u201cGeralt, get off him <em>now</em>!\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s weight disappears and Jaskier whimpers. Everything hurts. Where did Geralt go? Yen is talking again, and he tries to focus on her. His sister. He can listen to his sister. \u201cThis is going to hurt,\u201d she warns him. Jaskier blinks, not understanding. \u201cGeralt, hold his shoulders down so the idiot doesn\u2019t make it worse.\u201d Two strong hands press him down into the dirt. Yen says a word in Elder, and then everything is fire and Jaskier blacks out.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>When he wakes up next, Jaskier is laying in a bed. He\u2019s forgotten how comfortable beds are, damn Geralt for making him sleep so often in the woods. Wait. Geralt.</p>\n<p>Jaskier sits up, and the blinding pain he was expecting doesn\u2019t come. He looks down at his stomach, and there\u2019s only a thin scar where he remembers his insides spilling outside. He\u2019s about to call out, grateful to be waking up at all, but also anxious that he\u2019s woken up alone. Before Jaskier can open his mouth, he registers the quiet huffs of someone else\u2019s breath.</p>\n<p>Geralt is asleep on the pillow next to him. He looks peaceful, in ways that Jaskier usually isn\u2019t allowed to see, but there are dark circles under his eyes. Jaskier wants reassurance, he does, but the larger part of him insists he let Geralt sleep. The Witcher must be exhausted if he slept through Jaskier\u2019s abrupt awakening. </p>\n<p>So Jaskier lays back down and rolls onto his side. He feels a little tender, now that he\u2019s paying attention, but when he stops moving the feeling goes away.</p>\n<p>He falls asleep like that, watching his Witcher. The next chance he gets, Jaskier will sing a nice song for Yen, perhaps something that gives her flowers or fresh fruit. For now, he sleeps.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>The point is\u2014 well, the point is that Jaskier forgives his sister, even as she rips his heart out by sleeping with Geralt. He forgives her, because despite everything she\u2019s his friend, and he will always, always love her. Besides, for all that she gets Geralt in bed, Geralt in pleasure, Jaskier gets his own pieces of Geralt just for him.</p>\n<p>He gets Geralt sprawled in a bath, boneless beneath his hands as he washes monster guts out of his hair. He gets Geralt, black-eyed and fierce after killing a monster, terrifying to look at, but so gentle when he pulls Jaskier out of whatever trouble he\u2019s gotten into. He gets Geralt pressed against him on the cold winter nights, sharing a bedroll for warmth. </p>\n<p>He gets Geralt\u2019s half-smiles and Geralt\u2019s almost-laughs when Jaskier is especially witty. He gets Geralt\u2019s protection when Jaskier is threatened, and his grudging tending when he\u2019s hurt. Once, he even gets Geralt\u2019s humming when he thinks Jaskier out of earshot\u2014Geralt\u2019s soft humming of Jaskier\u2019s latest ballad. </p>\n<p>Yen might have Geralt\u2019s heart and his love, but Jaskier is happy. He\u2019s greedy enough to want everything Geralt has to give, sure, but this is enough. Yen even stops rubbing their relationship in Jaskier\u2019s face! So if sometimes Jaskier\u2019s chest aches, and his lyrics turn morose, he just has to remember that Geralt cares about him. Perhaps not exactly the way he wants, but he still cares.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s enough.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u201cPhew, what a day! I imagine you\u2019re-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit Jaskier! Why is it whenever I find myself in a pile of shit these days, it\u2019s you shoveling it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Child Surprise, the Djinn, all of it! If life could give me one blessing, it would be to take you off my hands!\u201d</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>After- well, after.</p>\n<p>Jaskier has a good cry, but then the cry doesn\u2019t stop. He cries his fucking heart out on the path out of town, until he has to lean against a tree or risk falling down. The funny thing is that he thought he knew heartbreak. Jaskier loves at the drop of a hat, hell he\u2019s been in love with Geralt for decades and watched him be with dozens of other people, including <em>his own sister</em>. None of that compares to the hole ripping his chest apart.</p>\n<p>Jaskier cries, and then finds a tavern and drinks the rest of his coin away.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s stupid, stupid, stupid, but without Geralt over his shoulder he can simply sing up anything he needs. And what he needs right now is to be drunk.</p>\n<p>That only works for a few days, before he faces the inevitable and sits down with his notebook of lyrics. The words are easy.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Jaskier the bard, they say,</em><br>\n<em>Died alone like he always feared.</em><br>\n<em>Simply never got up one day,</em><br>\n<em>Tired from all his years.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He died of a broken heart,</em><br>\n<em>No Witcher by his side</em><br>\n<em>His best friend tore him apart,</em><br>\n<em>Left his chest open wide.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Jaskier the bard, they say,</em><br>\n<em>Died alone like he always feared.</em><br>\n<em>Mem\u2019ry of him fades away,</em><br>\n<em>His face no longer clear.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>His Witcher, his sister all</em><br>\n<em>Forget he\u2019d ever been.</em><br>\n<em>Love pushed along his fall,</em><br>\n<em>No choice, but to start again.</em>\n</p>\n<p>It hurts to write, like pulling a thorny vine from his chest. Despite it all, despite everything, Jaskier likes being Jaskier. It\u2019s comfortable, more comfortable than Julian ever was. Jaskier is a creature of music and motion, and that\u2019s all he\u2019s ever wanted to be.</p>\n<p>Jaskier knows these lyrics are the right ones. The right choice. He\u2019ll leave Geralt with only the vaguest memory of him, let his songs alone carry the load of rehabilitating Witchers. Yen is clearly fine. Jaskier will just\u2026 go somewhere else. There\u2019s got to be more world out there somewhere, a place where his chest will stop hurting so much.</p>\n<p>Jaskier knows these lyrics are the right ones, but when he opens his mouth to sing them, he finds his voice caught in his throat. He can\u2019t. He can\u2019t make himself do it. He should, but he can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Fuck. Fuck!</p>\n<p>He goes back to drinking, notebook heavy in his pocket.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Yen finds him one night, after he\u2019s already too drunk to hold his head up, never mind make conversation. The world spins, but her violet eyes are a point of focus. He passes out.</p>\n<p>When he wakes, head aching, she\u2019s sitting by his bedside looking entirely unimpressed. \u201cAre you trying to pickle your brain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYen.\u201d Jaskier says. He pushes himself up to sitting and squints at her. Are those dark circles under her eyes? He didn\u2019t think she could get those. </p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d She looks even more unimpressed. \u201cMy question stands. Why isn\u2019t that white-haired imbecile stopping you from drowning yourself in ale?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier stares at her. It hasn\u2019t occurred to him that she wouldn\u2019t know. Doesn\u2019t the whole world know that Geralt broke his fucking heart?</p>\n<p>\u201cYen,\u201d he says again. His voice sounds absolutely horrible. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Geralt since the dragon.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stares at him. \u201cYou must be joking. You two are attached at the hip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs, and once he\u2019s started he can\u2019t stop. \u201cQuite unwilling on his part, apparently. Thought I\u2019d give him the blessing he asked for and just. Take myself off his hands.\u201d He\u2019s still laughing, he thinks, until Yen reaches out for his cheek and her hand comes away wet. Oh no. No no no, he\u2019s gotten over the crying, it makes his complexion look absolutely dreadful.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier,\u201d Yen\u2019s saying, and her eyes are wide, her hands squeezing his shoulders too tight. \u201cJaskier, you haven\u2019t done anything exceptionally idiotic since, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He snorts, wet and ugly. \u201cWhat, like sing myself out of existence? I have the words written but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to-\u201d</p>\n<p>Yen is off like a shot, rifling through his things until she finds his notebook of lyrics. She opens a portal and throws it through.</p>\n<p>\u201cYennefer what the fuck-\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns and slaps him across the face. Stunned, Jaskier holds his stinging cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you a coward, bard.\u201d Yen spits. \u201cI thought you <em>fought</em> for the things that you wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier stares at her, utterly bewildered. \u201cWhere did you get that stupid idea? I let you have Geralt, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yen steps back, almost like he had slapped her in turn. Then her face darkens. \u201cOh. I think I might actually murder that fool of a man.\u201d Jaskier opens his mouth. \u201cShut up. I\u2019m angry with you as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier shuts up. Or he intends to. What happens instead is that he says to his sister, \u201cLet me buy you a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>(After Geralt finds Ciri, after Ciri finds Geralt. After they are safe for a moment, and then a day, and then a week without running. After.</p>\n<p>After all that, Yennefer of Vengerburg says fuck it and portals into the middle of their campsite. Ciri screams, Geralt almost beheads her, and they\u2026 talk. For a long while. Their love is not meant to be. Not really. </p>\n<p>After Yen slaps Geralt, and Geralt apologizes, and Ciri stares wide-eyed. After.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that you\u2019ve started to pull your head out of your ass, I\u2019m not the only one you owe an apology to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier deserves an apology.\u201d Yen says, very slowly and clearly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when do you give a <em>shit</em> about Jaskier?\u201d Geralt snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier?\u201d Ciri asks. \u201cI know that name, but why would you need to apologize to him? I assumed he was dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt,\u201d Ciri says. \u201cHe\u2019s the only person you\u2019ve mentioned more than once. Wasn\u2019t he your best friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Yes. Fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you great lump of stupidity, maybe you should\u2019ve told him that occasionally?\u201d Yen taps a finger against her lips. \u201cOr even one time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Ciri says. \u201cI can help you apologize! You can give him a bunch of gifts of his favorite things, and we\u2019ll work on the words together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, Witcher.\u201d Yen looks entirely unimpressed. \u201cYou need a child to help you apologize?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Fine. I- miss his annoying chatter. It\u2019s. Too quiet.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Ciri cheers. \u201cWhat kind of things does he like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMusic,\u201d Geralt bites out. \u201cHe writes it. His lute. His clothes. Stories. Anything shiny and gaudy and ugly. Chocolate with little chunks of nuts. Perfumed oil, but expensive, and a certain scent. Flowers, but especially dandelions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Ciri says. \u201cWow, you didn\u2019t need as much help as I thought coming up with things.\u201d</p>\n<p>After everything. After Ciri falls asleep plotting by the fire. After, Yennefer of Vengerburg pinches the bridge of her nose to ward off a headache. </p>\n<p>Her magic must have latched onto the bard some point after they stopped hating each other so violently, because she always seems to know where he is now. She could fix this so quickly, by locking both Jaskier and Geralt naked in a bedroom. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s pining, she\u2019s always recognized and understood, to an extent. But to realize that <em>Geralt felt the same</em>, well. She\u2019ll have to come around more often, to make sure Ciri is exposed to at least one person with an ounce of sense. Those are plans for later. Right now, Jaskier owes her so many drinks and he doesn\u2019t even know it.)</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Jaskier stops drinking after Yennefer starts visiting him. He drinks with her, of course, but something about knowing that his sister hasn\u2019t forgotten him gives him the strength to start living again. He picks up his lute and he sings. His chest is still a gaping wound, but he\u2019s not alone. He doesn\u2019t move on, but he moves forward.</p>\n<p>Which is why he\u2019s taken completely off-guard when he follows suspicious noises into a clearing and sees Princess Cirilla, the Lion Cub of Cintra, Geralt of Rivia, and <em>fucking Yennefer</em> fighting off a pack of slimy monsters with very big teeth. And losing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d Jaskier says. He barely feels his mouth move. This is ridiculous. \u201cDestiny\u2019s a <em>bitch</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two of the slimy monsters peel away to ooze in his direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d Geralt says, as shocked as Jaskier has ever seen him. The Witcher freezes for a moment. They all do. Apparently none of them were prepared to run into each other like this. Oh, and he\u2019s going to have <em>words</em> with Yennefer later. He saw her two nights ago! And she hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about seeing Geralt. Then one of the monsters clamps onto Geralt\u2019s arm. \u201cFuck. Jaskier, run.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier takes a look at the losing fight, and decides to pull out his lute instead.</p>\n<p>Jaskier has never been taught magic. Everything he learned, he learned by trial and error. When he sings, the words matter, usually. He doesn\u2019t know why they matter, or why the order is important, but when he wants specific things he has to sing specific things. That makes sense at least. </p>\n<p>But his magic isn\u2019t always like that. Sometimes when he sings, <em>the words don\u2019t matter</em>. The only thing that guides the magic is Jaskier\u2019s own intent, and the strength of his song. He isn\u2019t quite sure how it works, and he doesn\u2019t use that kind very often. If he thinks about it too much, that amount of limitless, free-ranging magic is rather terrifying in its scope. The little that he\u2019s experimented with it has shown it to be rather useless for finely detailed work, which is the only thing he tends to do anyway.</p>\n<p>And yet. Two slimy beasts are surging in his direction, he doesn\u2019t have time to fiddle with lyrics specific enough to function, and Geralt is bleeding. He might be furious and heartbroken and hollowed out inside but that doesn\u2019t mean his Witcher is allowed to <em>bleed</em>. Also, he does love his sister.</p>\n<p>Jaskier knows his intent, so all he has to do is <em>sing</em>. </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhen a humble bard,</em><br>\n<em>Graced a ride along\u2026\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Damn, all that time singing in noisy taverns has really helped his ability to project. His voice echoes in the clearing, bouncing off the trees and thrumming deep in Jaskier\u2019s chest. He feels the magic in the air, in his throat, in his very fucking veins. The monsters freeze, every single one of them. Jaskier purposefully doesn\u2019t look at Geralt, who must be realizing now that Jaskier has been lying to him for oh, 24 years?</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t look. So he focuses on the monsters instead and keeps singing. They\u2019re frozen, and his magic is so strong in the air that it\u2019s hard to breathe. Jaskier can feel sweat gathering at his temples. He needs something simple. Something simple and strong.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cToss a coin to your Witcher,</em><br>\n<em>O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty\u2026\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>With the magic so thick that Jaskier can taste it, electricity and sunshine and music and flowers, with the magic pumping his heart and filling his lungs, Jaskier thinks <em>Now</em>. He doesn\u2019t stop singing.</p>\n<p>The monsters are still frozen, and Jaskier feels the magic slip out of his lungs. The two closest to him crumble to ash, slowly but surely. Jaskier\u2019s knees start to wobble, and he sinks down the grass. He keeps his back straight and his voice strong.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cToss a coin to your Witcher,</em><br>\n<em>O Valley of Plenty\u2026\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The one with its teeth in Geralt\u2019s arm crumbles, as do the three surrounding Yen and the Princess. Jaskier heaves in air, but his circular breathing training was clearly not for nothing. His voice doesn\u2019t crack. He can\u2019t focus well enough to continue on in the song, but a repeat of the chorus should do nicely for the last bunch.</p>\n<p>Jaskier sings until the last beast crumbles, until he\u2019s sweaty and shaking. And when the last note fades, things happen very fast. Yen stumbles, surely fighting his enchantment the entire time. Princess Cirilla tilts her head and asks \u201cDandelion?\u201d Geralt turns his own stumble into a run. Jaskier looks at the towering Witcher and his overlarge silver sword rushing towards him, and decides it\u2019s in his best interests to pass out.</p>\n<p>At least he was almost horizontal already.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>When Jaskier wakes up, Yen is sitting on the end of his bed and staring at him. The flash of deja-vu is strong enough that he reaches for his throat on reflex.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening, bard,\u201d Yennefer says. He can\u2019t decipher the expression in her eyes. </p>\n<p>Jaskier opens his mouth to reply and nothing comes out. His panic is real then. Yen must see it in his eyes because she hands him a jug of water. Jaskier sips, and the tightness in his throat eases.</p>\n<p>\u201cYennefer.\u201d His voice is a little scratchy, but not any worse so than after a long night of singing. \u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou just sang a dozen monsters to ash, and you want to know if everyone is okay. Your idiocy astonishes me. What even <em>are</em> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe exact same as you,\u201d Jaskier says, and he\u2019s not even lying.</p>\n<p>Yennefer scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cDandelion! You\u2019re awake!\u201d Princess Cirilla crashes through the door. \u201cGeralt heard your voice from downstairs, he\u2019s been worrying since we brought you here.\u201d She\u2019s gotten bigger since the last time Jaskier saw her. It\u2019s been more than a year, since he was rather too depressed to go to her last birthday celebration. She looks older, something wary about her eyes and tattered around her edges. For all that she\u2019s still undeniably a child, Jaskier doubts that she has much innocence left. He can\u2019t believe she survived. </p>\n<p>The hug catches him off-guard. He returns it though, and strokes her hair when she starts to cry just a little. She\u2019s so quiet when she cries. It hurts his heart.<br>\n\u201cThey\u2019re all gone,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThe entire court.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Princess.\u201d He hums a little, until she stops shaking as hard. Someone clears their throat from the doorway. Geralt is leaning against the door, watching them with something abnormally soft around his eyes. He\u2019s not smiling, but he raises an eyebrow when Jaskier looks his way. For a moment, Jaskier forgets everything that happened, about the mountain and the words his Witcher can never take back. \u201cUm. I can explain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the other thing!\u201d Princess Cirilla pulls away and her eyes are only a little red. \u201cI never knew that Dandelion wasn\u2019t your real name. Every time Geralt moped about Jaskier this, Jaskier that, I didn\u2019t know he was talking about my special birthday bard!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like a shock of cold water. Jaskier looks down at his lap, avoiding everyone\u2019s eyes. \u201cI doubt he mentioned me all that much.\u201d He doesn\u2019t bother curbing the bitterness in his voice. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe can deal with all your <em>drama</em> later,\u201d Yennefer says, and she sounds so fed up that Jaskier actually lifts his head. She glares at him. \u201cWhat was that little crack supposed to mean, bard? \u2018The exact same as you\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs and doesn\u2019t look at Geralt. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 quite human. Mostly human but\u2026 my father was a half-elf.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yen\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cHow did you know I was a quadroon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re part elf?\u201d Geralt asks. He doesn\u2019t sound angry, more confused than anything. Jaskier still can\u2019t bring himself to look at the doorway. His heart aches. </p>\n<p>\u201cOther than eyes that are a little too blue and quite a longer life-span, I don\u2019t have much to show for it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the magic.\u201d Geralt says. </p>\n<p>Jaskier closes his eyes. \u201cYes, that too I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Yennefer asks. \u201cI always thought the lack of crow\u2019s feet was suspicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, somewhere around sixty I think. One really does stop counting.\u201d Jaskier says, forcing a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re immortal.\u201d Geralt says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Geralt,\u201d Jaskier snaps. \u201cThat is generally what I meant by longer life-span. Though elves are probably more long-lived than immortal but thanks to Calanthe they\u2019re all slightly <em>too dead</em> for me to ask one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Princess Cirilla flinches and Jaskier hates himself a little more. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Jaskier pulls her in for a quick hug. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, I never should have said that, Princess. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can call me Ciri, you know,\u201d she mumbles into his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Ciri,\u201d Jaskier says. He gives her another squeeze. The weight of Geralt\u2019s eyes are burning into the top of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell!\u201d Yennefer claps her hands and Jaskier jumps. \u201cAs entertaining as this talk of genocide is, and trust me it is <em>truly</em> riveting, I think Ciri and I should be going. I\u2019m sure you two have things to discuss.\u201d Panic clogs Jaskier\u2019s throat. Yen leans over to help Ciri off the bed, and whispers into his ear. \u201cIf you try to magic your way out of this, I will hunt you down, and I will hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound of the door closing is far too reminiscent of a cage clanging shut. Jaskier looks down at his hands. \u201cSo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt grunts. For a second, Jaskier is so overwhelmed by loss that he has to fight back tears. Fuck. He even missed the grunting and growling.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019re monosyllabic then,\u201d Jaskier says. His voice is uneven. He soldiers through. \u201cIf you\u2019re planning on yelling at me, we can just skip that part and pretend that I listened. I\u2019ll be out of your hair as soon as they let us out of this room. I\u2019m rather sure Yennefer locked the door, so I don\u2019t know when that will be-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me.\u201d Geralt interrupts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jaskier makes the mistake of looking up. Geralt looks\u2026 uncomfortable, but that isn\u2019t quite right. Jaskier doesn\u2019t recognize his expression at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour heart is pounding. You stink of fear.\u201d Is that\u2026 guilt? No, Jaskier must be imagining things.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well, I apologize for my <em>stink</em> and ignoring that entirely creepy observation, I\u2019m not quite sure what you expected. The last time we spoke you rather thoroughly stomped all over my heart and emotions as you indicated that our twenty years of friendship was a little more one-sided than even I had thought. Now,\u201d Jaskier waves a hand. \u201cYou just found out that I lied about my origins and that I was secretly magic this entire time, so <em>excuse me</em> if I\u2019m a little worried about how you\u2019ll emotionally ravage me next!\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. That was a little more satisfying to get off his chest than he was expecting.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d Geralt says. It sounds like it hurts.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne-sided. You\u2019re my \u2018very best friend in the whole wide world\u2019, Jaskier,\u201d Geralt says. Jaskier can hear the quotes, remembers the steam rising from the bath, but he\u2019s a little too busy feeling his world tilt off its axis to notice.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lost at sea\u2014slow and stupid. Why would Geralt say that. He crushes the hope that tries to bloom, reminds it of his anger, of <em>if life could give me one blessing</em>. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt grits his teeth, but looks Jaskier straight in the eyes. (Gods he\u2019s missed those eyes). \u201cI. Need to apologize. For the mountain.\u201d Jaskier is too stunned to really process that Geralt seems to be going through a prepared speech. \u201cI was wrong. I was upset and I took it out on you. None of it was your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for you to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told me to,\u201d Jaskier says, quiet. \u201cYou said\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<em>If life could give me one blessing, it would be to take you off my hands!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d Geralt sounds firm, sure. \u201cI never want you to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier wants to believe him so badly. Against his will, his eyes fill up with tears. He sniffles. Great, like Geralt will want him around now-</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I. Doing it wrong?\u201d Geralt sounds worried. The stupid Witcher can probably smell the salt.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Jaskier waves him off and presses a hand over his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it exactly right, that\u2019s why I\u2019m crying. Please, please do carry on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s hand lands on Jaskier\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s a solid weight, comforting. Jaskier yearns to press into it, but he makes himself hold very still. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Geralt says firmly. \u201cI need you, Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Jaskier speaks into his wrist. \u201cFuck. Geralt, you really hurt my feelings on that mountain. I can\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have presents. For you. As an apology.\u201d Geralt says, hand still clasping Jaskier\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Jaskier whips his head up. His eyes are probably all puffy. \u201cPresents?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s lips twitch into an almost smile. \u201cYes, Jaskier, presents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he sniffs. \u201cLet me see the presents and then we\u2019ll see about forgiveness. I better be impressed, Witcher.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s hand leaves his shoulder, and Jaskier is immediately colder for it. The Witcher grabs a bag from the fireplace, and then sits next to Jaskier on the bed, a warm line of heat all along his side. Inside the bag are- are treasures.</p>\n<p>Silver strings, for his lute. A new notebook, bound in sleek genuine leather, embossed with a J. There\u2019s a dagger in there too, encrusted with far too many jewels and probably useless in a fight. His favorite scented oil, which can only be found in a small specialty shop near Oxenfurt. There\u2019s even <em>chocolate</em> with hunks of nut.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is all for me?\u201d Jaskier asks, voice thick.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Yen made a portal. For the oil.\u201d</p>\n<p>The amount of time and care that Geralt had to have put into this, in order to get all these things\u2026 Jaskier feels seen, in a way that he hasn\u2019t in so long. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI forgive you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt <em>smiles</em>. And it\u2019s a little too toothy and a little too fierce, but Jaskier loves it, loves him. </p>\n<p>Jaskier is five seconds away from doing something very, very stupid about that smile, when he hears the sound of a cheer. From the supposedly closed door. He rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you two are done eavesdropping\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Ciri and Yen walk back in, utterly shameless. Ciri is clapping, with a huge smile on her face. It looks like it hurts a little. Poor kid probably hasn\u2019t been smiling a lot lately. Yen looks more smug than anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did it! Just like we practiced.\u201d Ciri slides onto Geralt\u2019s other side, and he tucks her under his arm easily. Jaskier\u2019s heart melts. </p>\n<p>\u201cMen.\u201d Yen rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>Jaskier remembers, very abruptly, that his sister is a lying liar who lies. \u201cOh, Yennefer,\u201d Jaskier says, in a sing-song voice. She immediately looks wary. \u201cDon\u2019t think I forgot about you sneaking around with Geralt behind my back. I saw you <em>two days ago</em>. Revenge is sweet,\u201d Jaskier promises.</p>\n<p>Yennefer narrows her eyes, and he feels a touch of foreboding. \u201cSo I\u2019m assuming that since you two have kissed and made up, I can be giving you back your song notebook?\u201d No. She wouldn\u2019t. \u201cSince you won\u2019t be needing that tragic ballad to <em>sing yourself out of existence?</em>\u201d Oh, she totally went there. Sometimes his sister is a bitch.</p>\n<p>Geralt is a line of tension along his side. Ciri\u2019s eyes are wide and hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d he wheedles, backing up. \u201cI know you always yell at me for being reckless, Geralt\u2014which for the record, is the height of hypocrisy from someone who hunts monsters for a living\u2014but. But! I never sang it! So really I wasn\u2019t reckless at all. Besides, the song wouldn\u2019t actually hurt me, it would just make you all\u2026 forget about me? A little? Mostly you would forget my face and other specifics and think that I died.\u201d Geralt growls, and Jaskier continues quickly. \u201cBut! And again I think we\u2019re missing the point here, I never sang it. So no reason to be so grumpy and growly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ciri looks a little overwhelmed by the wave of words, but Geralt is unfazed. And scowling. He misses the smile from earlier, where did that go?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Ouch. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you out of my sight again unsupervised.\u201d And honestly, Jaskier doesn\u2019t have a problem with that.</p>\n<p>Tentatively, he scoots back over and leans his weight against Geralt. The Witcher doesn\u2019t push him off or anything. Progress!</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t notice Yen looking between them with exasperated eyes.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>So, Jaskier joins them on their travels. Geralt is careful with him at first, like somehow Jaskier having magic makes him even more fragile. After the third time Geralt gets himself injured instead of letting a monster so much as step in Jaskier\u2019s direction, he sings a little ditty that leaves Geralt with purple hair and a paper sword for a day.</p>\n<p>In other news, Ciri thinks he\u2019s hilarious.</p>\n<p>Yen comes and goes, and Geralt doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do with their grudging friendship. She still trips him into puddles and he still sings her clothes too tight and her hair gray, but even Jaskier can admit that she cares for him a bit. Not as much as he cares for her, not with him still being the only one that knows the truth, but\u2026</p>\n<p>He thinks about it often now. Coming clean. With the magic and the elf-heritage and the visiting Ciri all off his chest, Jaskier has so few secrets left. He imagines telling Yen a thousand times, and only half end up with her murdering him. But he\u2019s\u2026 scared. His only other secret, that he loves Geralt enough to tear him up inside, is something he plans to take to his grave. Their time apart hasn\u2019t dulled it any. In fact, the exaggerated care that Geralt takes with him now (placing his bedroll closest to the fire, making sure Jaskier eats first, washing his hair for him in the bath) twists him up inside more.</p>\n<p>Geralt didn\u2019t do this before, did he? </p>\n<p>Jaskier might be going insane. He makes Yen take him for a drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cYen, Yen, Yennefer, I\u2019m losing my mind,\u201d Jaskier moans, face pressed into a dirty wooden table.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t lose what you never had,\u201d she mutters, just loud enough for him to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cBut seriously, why is he doing this? My poor heart can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yen rolls her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to woo you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYen,\u201d Jaskier flinches. His voice turns serious. \u201cPlease don\u2019t joke about that. I know you think it\u2019s, it\u2019s funny or pathetic or sad, but please.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stares at him. \u201cBard, how stupid are you? I\u2019m not joking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier shakes his head. \u201cGeralt wouldn\u2019t- he isn\u2019t trying to woo me. He would never betray you like that. This is just guilt, or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetray me?\u201d Yen reaches over and pulls his drink away, as if that would sober him up. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been together since the mountain, and neither of us plans on changing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It\u2019s Jaskier\u2019s turn to stare, and Yen\u2019s turn to lay her head on the table. She looks entirely undignified and Jaskier is overwhelmed with a fierce love for his sister, even as she groans something about men being first-rate idiots into the wood.</p>\n<p>So Jaskier is losing his mind and Yennefer isn\u2019t any help.</p>\n<p>It comes to a head when Jaskier gets injured on a hunt.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing, barely a scratch in the scheme of things, but Geralt goes ballistic. Ciri stayed behind at the inn for safety\u2019s sake with Yennefer, so that leaves Jaskier alone with Geralt, a kikimore in far too many pieces, and an arm barely bloody.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, as Geralt growls and washes his arm and bandages what amounts to a bad paper cut. \u201cOkay, I think we need to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWith <em>words,</em> Geralt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier throws up his arms. Geralt growls, deep in his chest, as Jaskier messes up his bandaging. \u201c\u2018About what?\u2019 Are you serious? How about that growl? I\u2019m not a porcelain doll, you know! I\u2019ve done worse to myself shaving. Is there something going on that I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why in the flying fuck are you acting like this? Wait,\u201d Jaskier squints. \u201cIs it even you? You\u2019re a doppler, that would explain so much-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you hurt,\u201d Geralt says.</p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs. \u201cGeralt, I\u2019m human. Or human-ish, mostly human, whatever. That\u2019s what we do. I got hurt before and you didn\u2019t care this much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did. Care.\u201d Again, that sounded like it hurt Geralt to get out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that! You\u2019re being what passes for verbose, and emotionally vulnerable. You washed my hair the other day, Geralt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt grunts. It\u2019s a frustrated grunt, and really, truly Jaskier would love to know what Geralt thinks <em>he</em> has to be frustrated about in this situation.</p>\n<p>Jaskier opens his mouth for a witty reply, and then Geralt. Geralt kisses him.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s mind is completely empty. It takes a long time to reboot and kiss back, but it\u2019s worth it for the hand Geralt curls in his hair. The Witcher tugs, just a little. Jaskier whimpers into Geralt\u2019s mouth, and feels his stupid, stubborn lips curl up just a little in a smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Jaskier gasps, he puts a hand on Geralt\u2019s chest and pushes him back so that he has space to breathe. \u201cWait, what?\u201d Oh, so eloquent.</p>\n<p>Geralt grasps his chin, and forces Jaskier to look him in the eyes. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, wow, and now Jaskier\u2019s body has decided to very much get in on this. The one little functioning corner of his mind that sounds suspiciously like Yen goes <em>Jaskier you fucking dumbass what are you doing you\u2019re going to get so hurt</em> but the rest of him says fuck it. So Geralt wants him for sex. Should Jaskier sleep with him and break his own heart when Geralt continues to sleep with other people? Probably not. Is he going to do it anyway? You fucking bet.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck yes,\u201d Jaskier says. He buries his hands in Geralt\u2019s hair and pulls his Witcher back down.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u201cYen, Yen, Yennefer, why the fuck did I do that?\u201d Jaskier groans into another dirty wooden table. \u201cHe was, so, <em>unbelievably</em> good, which I\u2019m sure you know but. Fuck. I shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d His sister sounds somewhere between incredulous and infuriated but Jaskier doesn\u2019t lift his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause. Because now we fuck, but I\u2019m still in love with him and he doesn\u2019t feel the same way! I\u2019m literally breaking my own heart here I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d Jaskier thumps his head against the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for <em>fuck\u2019s sake</em>. Did you two even talk?\u201d Yen demands.</p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t reply. He just groans into the table some more.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to kill you both.\u201d</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Geralt hands him a bouquet. A bouquet of dandelions, of all things. Jaskier stares down at the flowers and thinks of a little girl locked away and the little boy that loved her. (Is it his and Geralt\u2019s story too?)</p>\n<p>The Witcher clears his throat. Fuck, but his eyes are almost the same gold as the flowers (there\u2019s a ballad in that). \u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt says, very clear like he\u2019s practiced. \u201cI want you to stay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt,\u201d Jaskier says, quiet. \u201cGeralt, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot just for sex. For everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. <em>Oh.</em></p>\n<p>Well, shit. He understands Yen\u2019s frustration now. </p>\n<p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Geralt asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jaskier throws himself at the Witcher. Geralt catches him, because of course he does. From behind a suspiciously placed tree, he hears Ciri cheer.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s far too busy sucking a bruise into Geralt\u2019s neck to notice Yen bend to pick up the dropped flowers and mutter a preservation charm. He doesn\u2019t see her staring at them, wistful and sad.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u201cI owe you so many drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBard, you have no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all of Jaskier\u2019s secrets now. All of them, except for one.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Jaskier was always going to tell her. Okay, not always. There were definitely times where his only plans involving Yen were a few protection charms and a see you never. But he got to know her again, and love her again, as someone a bit more sophisticated than a six-year-old boy. He always meant to tell her, but time passed and it just got more awkward, more\u2026 overwhelming.</p>\n<p>How do you even start that conversation?</p>\n<p>But they have time! Centuries of time. </p>\n<p>He never means to tell her like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cBard, if you don\u2019t stop talking with your mouth full I won\u2019t be responsible for my actions.\u201d \u201cOh please, Witch, you\u2019re just jealous that your mouth isn\u2019t full of-\u201d Jaskier looks over at Ciri, who\u2019s giggling at them with her chin resting in her hands. \u201cFood,\u201d he finishes lamely.</p>\n<p>Geralt snorts. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yen waves. \u201cPlease, what were you going to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier sticks his tongue out at her, the tavern noisy around them. \u201cYou\u2019re such a bi- big meanie sometimes.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yen raises an eyebrow and Ciri laughs, full and loud.</p>\n<p>The little troublemaker leans toward Geralt and stage whispers, \u201cIf that\u2019s what all siblings are like, I\u2019m so glad I never had them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier, with a big mouthful of ale, promptly chokes. Ale goes everywhere, and his eyes widen in panic. Ciri must have meant it as a joke, she must have, but Jaskier is coughing out a, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d before he\u2019s fully thought it through. The brief lack of oxygen to his brain really screwed him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait really?\u201d Ciri gapes, eyes wide. \u201cThe magic and the quarter-elf and the age and the eyes and the hair all seemed like funny coincidences but are you <em>serious?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt is still as stone to his right.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Julian?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier turns, and Yen looks as shaken as he\u2019s ever seen her. Her violet eyes are wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Fuck, this really wasn\u2019t what he had in mind. \u201cHi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yen rears back and punches him in the face. Jaskier topples to the floor. Okay, yeah, he fully deserved that one. She proceeds to sit on his chest and put a knife to his throat. He probably deserved that one too.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she hisses, and digs the blade in hard. \u201cYou\u2019re lying, you can\u2019t be him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier swallows, and feels the blade bob against his neck. \u201c\u2018Please don\u2019t be sad,\u2019\u201d Jaskier quotes. \u201c\u2018Even if you can\u2019t play with me, I love you.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Yen drops the knife. Her hands are shaking. \u201cWhat- what did the little princess say?\u201d He\u2019s never heard his sister stutter like this, not all grown up.</p>\n<p>Jaskier meets her eyes. \u201cShe told the little prince \u2018Once I explore the world, I will come back for you, and we will leave this castle forever.\u2019 Why didn\u2019t you come back for me, Yen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d she says, and to Jaskier\u2019s horror her eyes fill up with tears. \u201cI did, Julian, I promise, but he said you were <em>dead</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d Jaskier says. He sits up and pulls Yen into a hug. Hesitantly, tentatively, she hugs him back. Within seconds, her grip turns strangling. Jaskier lets her have it.</p>\n<p>Over her shoulder, he can see Geralt holding Ciri back, which warms his heart more than it should. The Witcher\u2019s face is unreadable. Jaskier closes his eyes and starts stroking her hair. The noise of the tavern picks up again slowly.</p>\n<p>When Yen pulls back, she looks mostly composed, if a little raw around the edges. They sit back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d She asks.</p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs and looks down at the table. \u201cI was\u2026 angry, at first. I thought you didn\u2019t care enough to come back. I waited for years, and then when I left I became famous at Oxenfurt under the name Julian. Hell,\u201d Jaskier buries his face in his hands. \u201cMy name as a bard was literally the nickname you gave me as a kid. I thought that if you wanted to find me, you would have, so that meant you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>A hand wraps around his wrist. \u201cJulian, of course I went back for you.\u201d She pulls his hands away from his face, makes him meet her eyes. \u201cIt took years, but I went back and that fool of a man that called himself our father said you died of a sickness, a few years after I left. Good riddance, he said, and I drowned him in his own blood.\u201d She squeezes. \u201cI was always going to go back for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, um.\u201d Jaskier sniffles a little, and tries to pretend that\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing. Right, lighten the mood, he can do that. \u201cIt also didn\u2019t hurt that the first time I saw you after forty years you were naked and fucking the love of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dead silence. Not a single laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re siblings,\u201d Geralt says, with something like dawning horror. \u201cWait, the love of your life?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yen turns pale. \u201cOh no, oh no, I <em>fucked Geralt</em>. I tortured my baby brother for six years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, hey there,\u201d Jaskier raises both of his hands. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s fine, I forgave you ages ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Yen turns her glare onto Geralt. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with my baby brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYen, please don\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh sweet Melitele,\u201d Ciri whispers. She sounds far too delighted.</p>\n<p>Yen freezes, and Jaskier can see the realization flash across her face. \u201cThe mountain. You broke up with us both on the <em>same day?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, Geralt\u2019s fucked.</p>\n<p>~</p>"
