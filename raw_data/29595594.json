  "notes": "<p>I'm so sorry if this is bad...I'm so tired, I have like...five tests (two of which are exams) this week and wow I can't fully focus on my screen anymore.</p>\n<p>But I hope you like it well enough! &lt;3</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>What did you think? Thoughts, comments, suggestions for future characters?</p>\n<p>(Also, sorry that my update schedule is so wack. I...life, you know?)</p>\n<p>Until next time! &lt;3</p>",
  "text": "<p>\n<span>Saturday comes and goes, as it does, and Shouta Aizawa doesn\u2019t even begin to think of the next assignment for his student until Sunday is already halfway over. It\u2019s well into the afternoon, now, and Shouta frowns as he looks at his phone, wondering what assignment he should give his student, if one at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya deserves more breaks, after all. Last week, it was nice seeing Midoriya just...act as a normal kid, as himself, taking Wednesday and Thursday to get to sit and relax with his friends, without a part to play except his own. Because, sure, Shouta thrives on chaos, and his kid is great at causing it, but, damn, the kid deserves a chance to be himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But then comes the fact that, well...Midoriya </span>\n<em>\n<span>likes</span>\n</em>\n<span> doing these assignments. And it\u2019s been helping the boy to improve himself, and his grades. He\u2019s been steadily improving, at a much faster and much less destructive rate than before, and it\u2019s been </span>\n<em>\n<span>good</span>\n</em>\n<span> for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So maybe it\u2019s a little hard to make up his mind, and maybe Shouta has been glaring at his phone for far too long. Sue him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s overthinking it. For tomorrow, he\u2019ll have Midoriya impersonate someone. He\u2019ll let the kid take a break, after, though. He needs to minimize the amount of assignments he gives Midoriya, once the boy starts partaking in work-studies. He doesn\u2019t want his Problem Child to overwork himself, as the greenet is prone to doing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So again comes the question: who should Midoriya impersonate for tomorrow?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta hums, leaning back into his chair as he tries to recall the rules that he\u2019s set out. They have to be chaotic, but not in a way that\u2019s endearing. Someone covered up, but not with clothes that are skintight. Preferably someone older, but in a senile way, not an \u2018I need makeup to be less attractive\u2019 kind of way. Someone who is more chaotic than calming, who will strike the fear of God into the hearts of his students.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And, most importantly, someone who won\u2019t cause Izuku Midoriya to gain more suitors, not when Shouta is still trying to figure out how to sit Todoroki down to make sure the boy will treat his not-quite-a-son right, and put in enough healthy intimidation to keep the heterochromatic teen true to his words.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(That last part...may take a while, but that\u2019s quite alright. Todoroki seems to be too afraid, and Midoriya far too oblivious, for the two to get together anytime soon.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Right. Right. Those are the most important rules, and the ones that Shouta needs to follow. So who does that leave him with?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well, Ectoplasm could be an option, although Shouta doesn\u2019t have a clue whether or not Midoriya has the proper attire for such an outfit- and how would Midoirya work around the legs, anyways? Or the man\u2019s Quirk, for that matter? Midoriya has had moments where he\u2019s clearly tried to recreate Quirks, from Bakugou\u2019s explosions to Shigaraki\u2019s decay- which Shouta still isn\u2019t sure what the kid did, but he </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span> rather creative with his acting, so Shouta will let him keep his secrets, this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta doesn\u2019t quite </span>\n<em>\n<span>want</span>\n</em>\n<span> to know, however, how Midoriya would recreate such a Quirk. Likely with the help of his friends...and wow, Shouta does </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> want to see dozens of mini Ectoplasms running around, causing mayhem. That\u2019s too much for even him, admittedly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So who is next? Cementoss? No, no, Midoriya doesn\u2019t have makeup, he wouldn\u2019t have the paint to cover himself gray- and besides, Ishiyama keeps his arms completely exposed. Shouta can\u2019t let Midoriya do that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe...Lunch Rush? Admittedly, Shouta himself isn\u2019t sure whether or not the man has a Quirk beyond his abnormal appearance, or if his cooking </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span> his Quirk...so maybe </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alright, what heroes are there outside of Yuuei? Oh, maybe Midoriya should be-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His phone buzzes, and Shouta blinks. It\u2019s a message from Nedzu.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Don\u2019t worry about Midoriya\u2019s next assignment, I\u2019ve already chosen the perfect one for him! In fact, I\u2019ll even let you know, just let me\u2026</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With wide eyes, Shouta watches as his phone acts on its own, no doubt controlled by Nedzu as it exits out of the conversation, slipping into his chat with Midoriya. Letters begin to fill the screen, and Shouta lets out a curse when he sees the name being presented. Hastily, he tries to delete the words, but his keyboard can\u2019t do anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so Shouta watches with dismay as the text is sent, and marked read not thirty seconds later.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Midoriya responds as he always has, cheerfully accepting the task.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh kami, Shouta is going to regret tomorrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Across the campus, Nedzu cackles.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s not unusual, to the students of 1-A, for Izuku Midoriya to not be in class when the rest have all arrived. It\u2019s just a sign of things to come, to them. A warning of chaos, of a Midoriya that </span>\n<em>\n<span>isn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nor is it unusual for Aizawa to be in the room before them all, laying in his sleeping bag, clearly waiting for the day to begin. Eyes shut, but still seeing, still listening, still aware and ready.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Aizawa is not in his sleeping bag today. No, today he is standing at his podium, head down, like a man grieving for a loss yet to be known. His hair hangs, casting a shadow around his face, a curtain that does its best to conceal his pain and grief.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s...confusing. An enigma, certainly. Because Midoriya is not in the room, and that means that he is about to act. Yet Aizawa still looks like anything but a satisfied man, ready to watch the world burn with fear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, he is the fearful man, and no one knows why.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not until Midoriya enters the room, and everything becomes crystal clear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because today, today Midoriya does not follow the trend that had been. Gone are the constant coverups, the long pants and matching tops, the masks to hide his features and baggy pieces to hide his muscles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Today, when Midoriya walks into the room, all eyes are on him, taking in the sight that is the green-haired wonder. The main piece is a sleeveless white leotard with dark purple trim around the shoulders and waist, a crescent moon over his chest and thick metal plates guarding his midriff. Purple thigh high boots run up his legs, with plating around the heels and toes, giving his feet a rabbit-like appearance. Thick white gloves are on the boy\u2019s hands, and long white ears poke out of his head, clearly metallic yet still moving seamlessly, tracking noises as they twitch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a smile full of confidence, and a hand placed carelessly on his hip, Midoriya tilts his head and winks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the students of 1-A understand why Aizawa seems to be dying, because they feel much the same. For a reason that is different, but a cause that is much the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because Izuku Midoriya is impersonating the Rabbit Hero: Miruko, and there are no doubts that grades are going to drop today.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kami, have mercy on their souls\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hizashi Yamada knows that something is wrong the moment that he sees Shouta Aizawa walking through the halls. Because Hizashi knows Shouta, and he knows the man well.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And while Shouta usually looks like he\u2019s one missed night of sleep away from death, he usually doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>mourning</span>\n</em>\n<span> over the idea.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But here he is, with his shoulders slumped and head down, hair drooping in front of him more than usual. The man's hands aren't tucked into his pockets, instead dangling by his sides, as if he's so destroyed that he's forgotten his natural stance.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hizashi isn't dumb. He knows his friend well, and knows that there are few things that could make Shouta act in such a way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And considering the past few weeks, there are only three things that Hizashi can think of, that may have occurred to cause such a reaction.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first is the most unlikely, only a passing thought that gets brushed aside as soon as it comes. The first option is that Izuku Midoriya, the resident sunshine child and unofficial son of Shouta Aizawa, finally realized that Shouta cares for him like a son (because, really, for as analytical and observant as Midoriya can be, he's practically as oblivious as a rock when it comes to people caring for him)...and didn't react well.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It's a thought that can easily be dismissed, for two reasons of its own. For one, again, Midoriya is </span>\n<em>\n<span>very</span>\n</em>\n<span> oblivious. It seems to stem from his low self-esteem, no doubt a product of his past in some way, shape, or form.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But even ignoring that, there's another rather simple fact that Hizashi knows to be truth, even if the boy has never said it himself: Izuku Midoriya would never be upset by the unofficial adoption, because Midoriya clearly holds Shouta in high regard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Seriously. Just look at them. They're a family of chaos in the making!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So the first option can be dismissed, which brings Hizashi to the second: someone finally confessed to Midoriya.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This option, too, can be waved away, because Shouta is alone. If someone </span>\n<em>\n<span>had</span>\n</em>\n<span> confessed, Hizashi knows that Shouta would be dragging them away for a talk, scowling more than sad.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which means there's only one real option...Izuku Midoriya is dressed up as a hero, and it's one that's causing his class to fall even further for the boy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So when Hizashi walks in through the doors of 1-A, it\u2019s with a heavy heart and a weary gaze.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And, really, he should have expected this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Midoriya is sitting on his desk- not in, but </span>\n<em>\n<span>on</span>\n</em>\n<span> the table- waiting casually, one leg swinging as he leans back, arms supporting his weight with ease. He\u2019s talking to Uraraka and Yaoyorozu, apparently unaware of the way that quite a few of his peers are entranced by his casual pose, even the ones who look like they want to be anything but. Eyes linger, then dart away, except for a certain dual-haired boy, who stares up at Midoriya like the boy is the sun and he is a sprout, stuck to do nothing but watch in awe.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which is rather ironic, Hizashi thinks, since Midoriya is the green one, and Todoroki the one who wields fire, but he digresses, because Midoriya is speaking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s all about taking what you want,\u201d Midoriya says, shrugging, the motion fluid and easy, the action rolling through him and leaving him leaning even further back than before. \u201cThe world is a bitch, yeah, but it\u2019s all about making her </span>\n<em>\n<span>your</span>\n</em>\n<span> bitch.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For some reason, Uraraka and Yaoyorozu seem oddly empowered by Midoriya\u2019s explanation, especially when Midoriya continues, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about those who doubt you. They\u2019ll come a dime a dozen, yeah, but fuck \u2018em all. Just keep doing what feels right, and spring for the top, and you\u2019ll make it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m gonna do my best,\u201d Uraraka whispers, in a reverent way that reminds Hizashi of the passion she held during the Sports Festival, and the fire in Yaoyorozu\u2019s eyes seem to be a similar spark to the brunette\u2019s, only kindled further by Midoriya\u2019s encouragements.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seems as if Midoriya is giving some kind of...inspirational speech. Perhaps one about becoming a female hero, from the way that the other girls all seem to be listening in, in some way. It seems to be working, too, lighting a new drive underneath them all, one by one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Hizashi, as he sees it, has two choices in this instant. The first is to do what he did the last time, when Midoriya was dressed up in the R-rated costume that caused his vast number of admirers to somehow spike.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The second option is to laugh, because finally, </span>\n<em>\n<span>finally</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Shouta is facing true consequences for his life decisions, the very choices that have caused Hizashi to suffer for so long.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yeah, Hizashi goes with the latter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it\u2019s nice to be able to brush it off and laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even if he has to deal with most of his students being too distracted by Midoriya\u2019s physique to focus on the prepositions he has on the board.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019ll take it, because it comes with the satisfaction of knowing that Shouta is being just as affected as Hizashi was in the beginning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh</span>\n</em>\n<span>, isn\u2019t it vindicating?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The time for lunch arrives, and the students of 1-A watch as Midoriya disappears, getting up and leaving the room without a second thought, ears twitching as if he's listening to something far away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They don't follow him, assuming it's the wisest decision, instead going to the cafeteria to enjoy their meal before training.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And lunch goes...rather calmly, surprisingly. Midoriya doesn't startle anyone in the cafeteria, nor does he make his way into the teacher's lounge. The halls are silent and not even the cameras can spot head nor tail- </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span> Midoriya wearing a tail? No one can quite remember, can quite recall if they had seen one or not- of him. It\u2019s almost as if he's not on campus at all- a feeling that is both calming and worrying. Relaxing, in the way that it offers a sense of serenity, of a known peace that won\u2019t be shattered, not yet, not now. Yet all the same it stresses those who await his return, his next appearance, because it\u2019s like he was never there at all, no trace of him to be found. It\u2019s like Midoriya made his appearance on stage and then exited stage left, disappearing behind the curtains and out of sight of his eager audience, leaving behind a silence as the people await the final act.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But the actor is hidden.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But it's fine. Midoriya wouldn't just </span>\n<em>\n<span>leave campus</span>\n</em>\n<span>, would he?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, of course not. That'd be silly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(And maybe they're right, that Izuku Midoriya wouldn't.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Miruko would, and that's how Rumi Usagiyama finds her impersonator standing over an unconscious villain, smiling confidently as he ties the man to a lamppost. And she will question this moment, but only for an instant, and then she will laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She\u2019s heard rumors, of course, of the little actor of Yuuei. One cannot have such an act go on for three weeks, going on a fourth, in such a prestigious institution without word beginning to reach the outside world. And word has reached, little videos of the actor being posted, the message being spread. A mix of marketing students and heroes who have had their image embodied, and those who remain outside of those spheres to join.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yes, Rumi Usagiyama connects rumors to truth quickly, and she cannot be anything but impressed as she sees the boy who has molded her image so well to his own, making it one and the same.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The day is only halfway through, and impressions make for great first impressions.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Standing here, watching his successor throw down with nineteen other teenagers, Toshinori Yagi can\u2019t figure out whether or not it\u2019s appropriate to be proud of his boy in this situation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he is. By Nana above, he is.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This hadn\u2019t been a part of the plan, when Toshinori called 1-A to get dressed into their gym uniforms and head down to the gym. It was supposed to be a simple day of sparring, because, to be quite honest, being able to fight </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span> one of the biggest parts of being a hero. But it was just...just simple spars. Nice, easy, routine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Midoriya turned to his peers, and issued them all a challenge.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s fight! All of you against one of me- we\u2019ll see if you even stance a chance against a </span>\n</em>\n<span>bunny</span>\n<em>\n<span>, or if you need to be sent packing!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the students of 1-A, who have taken the Plus Ultra nature of the school in their hands and gone even further beyond the motto\u2019s calling, answered without hesitation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s how it began, with some of the more eager students taking the charge. Bakugou, for one, being the first to leap forwards, an explosion sending him to the front of the group, a right hook aimed perfectly at Midoriya\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And missing just as clearly, so obvious that no one could deny it. But Midoriya didn\u2019t make any comments, no.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, he simply smiled, eyes taunting, and that was enough. Bakugou lunged again, hand outstretched.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was on the floor just seconds later, and the class went wild. If Toshinori were to take a guess, he\u2019d say that this is what Aizawa saw, when the third year Togata challenged 1-A to an all-out brawl. Toshinori can\u2019t say this with total certainty, of course, but he knows his class.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he can say with quite a bit of confidence that he thinks Aizawa would understand the feeling that Toshinori feels now, watching 1-A try to fight Midoriya, nineteen hero hopefuls against one impressive impersonator.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the feeling is pride, surely and truly, because young Midoriya is decimating his peers, knocking them down quicker than they can even rise to the challenge, tripping them up and sending them sprawling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s impressive on its own, how strong his successor has become. Midoriya has grown, and it shows in how he moves, every moment used with care, every action analyzed and understood intimately.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But it\u2019s all the more impressive when one remembers that Midoriya is acting not as himself, but as another.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And while Izuku Midoriya has adapted to his injuries and focused less on punches, rounding out his style with Full Cowling...well, Miruko is more of a kicker.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Midoriya isn\u2019t one to ignore such a prominent fact.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So it is with nothing but his legs, his laugh, and a little bit of lip service that Midoriya beats his peers in a brutal takedown, eyes wide with exhilaration as he bounces from spot to spot, opponent to opponent, until no one is left.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only then does Midoriya still, hands landing on his hips as he asks, \u201cIs that it? Can\u2019t take the heat of a little rabbit? Guess I\u2019m just too good, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No one disagrees, not one bit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Truly, that\u2019s the correct answer to be offered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Yeah, Toshinori is proud.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He couldn\u2019t have found a more worthy successor of One for All, a better boy to call his son.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only a fool would believe otherwise.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku takes a deep breath, looking at the door before looking back down, grateful for Togata\u2019s patience. The boy had brought him to Nighteye\u2019s-</span>\n<em>\n<span>the</span>\n</em>\n<span> Sir Nightye\u2019s- agency right after school for him to meet the man himself and ask to be mentored.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well, right after Izuku got changed, of course, because Togata sent him straight to the dorms before telling him to meet at the gate.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best to wear your normal uniform,\u201d Togata said cheerfully, not quite looking at Izuku, but not as affected as his peers seemed to be all day over his showing of skin- likely due to the nature of Togata\u2019s very own Quirk. \u201cSir wasn\u2019t the most impressed, the first time I accidentally showed too much, so it\u2019s probably better to change first.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which Izuku isn\u2019t sure was necessary, after seeing Bubble Girl, but...okay!\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now Izuku just needs to...go in. His blond senpai isn\u2019t pushing for him to rush, a solid, steady presence next to him, but Izuku doesn\u2019t want to waste time. Not for the only known sidekick for All Might in all of history!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With this in mind, Izuku knocks on the door, and then pushes it open when given the clear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sir Nighteye is already standing, although it appears that he just got up, hands still resting on his desk and body angles in a way that implies he wasn't finished positioning himself. Curtly, the man rises fully, straightening his back and making himself appear even taller, all the more intimidating now that he can peer even further down at Izuku.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But appearances aren't everything, Izuku knows, and so he still moves forwards, into the room, lifting a hand to shake the man\u2019s own.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Hi!\" Izuku greets. \"Thank you for agreeing to meet. I'm Izuku Midoriya...I wanted to talk to you about work-studies?\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alright, so maybe he falters at the end, but Izuku thinks he did pretty well to start. But Nighteye simply blinks down at him, before shifting his gaze to Togata, who still lingers in the doorway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Shouldn't you be on patrol right now?\" Nighteye asks, and Togata shoots upright.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Right! See you around, Midoriya- hopefully around the office, too!\" Then, lowering his voice, he adds in a whisper, \"Remember: try to make him laugh! He loves jokes!\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku watches the door shut, and then looks to Nighteye, who still keeps the same, blank look on his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Staring at the man, Izuku decides to lower his hand and pocket the All Might impression that he had planned to do, when Togata had originally given him the advice on the way over. He doesn\u2019t seem very amused, and probably wouldn\u2019t be afterwards, either. It probably wouldn\u2019t go over well, especially since Sir Nighteye and All Might aren\u2019t partners anymore.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So Izuku chooses something else, taking a page from Aizawa\u2019s book and hopping straight to the point, because Nighteye seems like the type who likes to cut to the chase as soon as possible.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTogata-senpai recommended you as a great mentor,\u201d Izuku says, keeping his smile as perfectly in place as he can. \u201cHe said that you were able to make him the hero he\u2019s becoming today, and praised your ability to turn him from the weakest link to one of the strongest parts of the chain. I\u2019ve made progress with my Quirk, but it\u2019s fickle, and-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour Quirk,\u201d Sir Nighteye interrupts, and Izuku blinks in surprise. \u201cIs that what you called it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cY-yes, Sir,\u201d Izuku agrees, and Nighteye hums.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that so? You have the nerve, the vanity to call it yours?\u201d Head tilting downwards, Nighteye states, \u201cI would have assumed it was All Might\u2019s more than yours, is it not?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku doesn\u2019t know why it surprises him, the fact that Sir Nighteye knows that he is the current holder of One for All, but it\u2019s a surprise that he forces himself past.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It makes </span>\n<em>\n<span>sense</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Izuku tells himself, that the man knows. Yagi had encouraged him to go to his former sidekick, and had mentioned that the man knew of the Quirk\u2019s nature. It\u2019s only logical to assume that, somewhere along the line, Yagi let Nighteye know about who his successor is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Right. This should make it...easier, then.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYagi-\u201d Izuku watches how Nighteye frowns at the use of the man\u2019s last name, and quickly steers clear of </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> problem, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>All Might</span>\n</em>\n<span> gave me the Quirk. He said it\u2019s mine, now, and to treat it as such.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you use it like a fool,\u201d Nighteye states, and Izuku blinks in surprise, smile slipping.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI- I\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>sorry</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not worthy of One for All,\u201d Nighteye says, voice dismissive as he steps closer, hand reaching out and tapping at his arm. \u201cI saw your usage of it, during the Sports Festival. You were unrefined, an embarrassment to the legacy. You do nothing but break yourself, and you are merely a </span>\n<em>\n<span>child</span>\n</em>\n<span> playing with the weapon of a pillar.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku stares, wordless, as Nighteye shames him for the events of his past, for a time when no one was able to help, to offer advice. A time Izuku is </span>\n<em>\n<span>well</span>\n</em>\n<span> past, a time that no longer showcases even a percent of what Izuku can do.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Is Full Cowling nothing? Is his Shoot Style so worthless? Are the dozens of fighting styles that Izuku has adopted, has adapted to, has made his </span>\n<em>\n<span>own</span>\n</em>\n<span>...are they nothing? Does Nighteye not recognize these?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Does Nighteye not </span>\n<em>\n<span>care</span>\n</em>\n<span>?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Inexplicable rage- no, no, it\u2019s explicable, it\u2019s comprehensible and understandable and </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh</span>\n</em>\n<span>, so strong- courses through him, hotter than the crackling lightning that dances under Izuku\u2019s skin, ready to burst and show this man exactly what he can </span>\n<em>\n<span>do</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Nighteye gives him the chance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want you here,\u201d Nighteye states calmly, as if talking about the weather, about something unimportant. \u201cBut I will give you a chance. You have three minutes to take this stamp from my hand, and mark your form with it. If you manage to do that, I will teach you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he will not </span>\n<em>\n<span>respect</span>\n</em>\n<span> Izuku, will he?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will he?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku doesn\u2019t know, but he </span>\n<em>\n<span>does</span>\n</em>\n<span> know that he\u2019s being given a chance. Not a good one, no, but one he will take.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One he will use, to prove a point.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so Izuku moves, lunging and darting and ricocheting, all predicted by Nighteye\u2019s ever-seeing gaze, empowered by a Quirk that sees all that he does and all that he will. And Izuku knows, he knows exactly the message that Nighteye is trying to give.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His every move is pointless. He cannot win.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Izuku isn\u2019t the bone-breaking, foolish teen that Nighteye has pinned him down as. No, he is Izuku Midoriya, and he\u2019s beginning to realize that he\u2019s a </span>\n<em>\n<span>hell</span>\n</em>\n<span> of a lot more than people have let him know.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So Izuku moves, and he shows everything that he is, crackling green as he darts, as he drops, as he, eventually, figures something out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nighteye can see his movements.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He </span>\n<em>\n<span>can\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> see some of the results.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The flick of a finger can be tracked, but not the air that follows, if the current is weak enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Grinning wildly, Izuku follows through, and the gust is enough to knock the stamp out of Nighteye\u2019s lazy grasp. Darting in, ignoring Nighteye\u2019s gasp, Izuku grabs the stamp, moves to his paper\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And pauses. Hums.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Drops the stamp on the desk, uncaring of how it leaves ink on his form, too busy glaring at Nighteye, who stares right back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The timer runs out, and Izuku doesn\u2019t care. Nor does he care about the fact that he won.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, he just shakes his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d Izuku says, voice full of a confidence and conviction that doesn\u2019t feel entirely like his own, but not unlike his own either. \u201cI think I\u2019ll find someone else to teach me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou passed,\u201d Nighteye states, however, eyes clearly confused, Quirk still shining within them. \u201cYou...bested me. You won fair and square.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did,\u201d Izuku agrees. \u201cAnd now I am deciding, fair and square, that I do not want to be taught by a man who thinks he has the right to say whether or not my Quirk is my own. I came here hoping to find a </span>\n<em>\n<span>teacher</span>\n</em>\n<span>, someone to build me up. If I wanted to hear someone belittle me, I\u2019d go back to my middle school educators, Sir.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nighteye looks, in all honesty, like he\u2019s going to say something. His mouth is open and his eyes are narrowed with a sense of loss, but Izuku doesn\u2019t trust the words he plans to say to be good.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So Izuku looks away, picking up his paper, nodding his head in farewell, and walking out of the door. He doesn\u2019t pay much attention to Togata, who first offers a smile and congratulatory fist bump, only to blink in surprise at the anger in Izuku\u2019s eyes, and then the blond is hurrying to Sir\u2019s office, as if he, too, is confused by this turn of events. No, Izuku pays this interaction little care, all too focused on getting out of the agency he was so excited to be in not ten minutes ago.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And for some reason, as Izuku exits the agency, he can almost swear that he still hears Nighteye\u2019s voice, the man talking to Togata.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But it\u2019s probably just the wind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sitting in his office, Shouta Aizawa hums, looking at his phone. He\u2019s considering whether or not he should give Midoriya an assignment for the next day, leaning more towards a \u2018no\u2019 than a \u2018yes\u2019. But then, as he moves to type, he sees the signature three dots pop up, implying that Midoriya is texting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then a message comes through.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>May I talk to you, sensei?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He says yes, of course, and not five minutes later, the boy is knocking on the door, entering the office.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI went to see Sir Nighteye,\u201d Midoriya begins, but he looks far too upset by such a statement. Especially when he follows it with, \u201cHe offered to mentor me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Alright,\" Shouta says, feeling far too much like a parent who is ready to fight a Pro Hero. \"You sound upset by this. Why?\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"He doesn't think I'm good enough,\" Midoriya says, and Shouta can't help but be confused, because in what </span>\n<em>\n<span>world</span>\n</em>\n<span> is his son not good enough? \"He says I don't live up to my potential, that I'm not as good and will never be as good as someone like Togata.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"He's wrong,\" Shouta says, plainly, and Midoriya smiles. It's weak, but it's something.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"I...I thought so, too. It doesn't make sense to me, to compare me to Togata. Of </span>\n<em>\n<span>course</span>\n</em>\n<span> Togata is stronger, and knows his Quirk better. He's </span>\n<em>\n<span>supposed</span>\n</em>\n<span> to- that's the whole point of experience, isn't it? But Sir seemed upset by it, and I- I didn't get it.\" Shrinking into his seat, Midoriya admits, \"I rejected his offer.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"You did?\" Shouta asks, although he's not surprised. No, he's proud.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"I didn't\u2026 I didn't want another teacher like the ones I used to have.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya is standing up for himself, protecting himself, why </span>\n<em>\n<span>wouldn't </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shouta be anything but proud?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"I'm glad,\" Shouta says, and Midoriya looks up with wide, wondering eyes. \"Kid, you don't need to intern with someone who is just going to knock you down for things that aren't your fault.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Thank you,\" Midoriya breathes, but Shouta isn't done, an idea coming to mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cProblem Child,\u201d Shouta says, and Midoriya still watches him with the same curious gaze. \u201cHow would you like to mentor under me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya </span>\n<em>\n<span>beams</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and Shouta responds in kind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(In the distance, the world trembles.)</span>\n</p>"
