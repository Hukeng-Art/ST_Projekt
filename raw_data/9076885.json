  "text": "<p>Lance stares down at the snapchat, panicking. <em> Oh god, shit, holy mother fucking crow</em>. He\u2019d just sent a shirtless gym selfie to Keith, someone he barely knew, with the caption \u2018bet you wanna lick these nips.\u2019</p>\n<p>That was supposed to go to Hunk! Hunk would have laughed and wrote back something like \u2018sure buddy,\u2019 used to Lance\u2019s slightly inappropriate snapchats by now. Lance likes to think he has a nice body, it\u2019s definitely gotten nicer in the six months he\u2019s been going to the gym. He likes taking pictures, why wouldn\u2019t he? And he likes sending them to his best friend, who gives him the praise he\u2019s looking for. (Bless Hunk and his never ending compliments.)</p>\n<p>What he doesn't like is accidentally sending suggestive snapchats to Keith fucking Kogane, who he\u2019s had a grand total of four conversations with, one of those conversations happening last night over snapchat, Keith having asked Lance what the reading assignment was for their Writing 121 class.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how this happened! It was all Keith\u2019s fault. If Keith wouldn't have snapchatted him last night, then his name wouldn\u2019t have been in the \u201cfriends\u201d section and seriously, why did snapchat think they were friends after sending a grand total of five snapchats to each other? <em> Come on Snapchat!</em> So this was Keith\u2019s fault and it was Snapchat\u2019s fault. Lance couldn't be blamed.</p>\n<p>Lance swipes Hunk\u2019s snapchat name to the right, frantically typing out a message to inform Hunk of his impending doom.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to hunk \u2661</em><br>\n&gt;i\u2019m gonna fukin die hunk oh mygod i sent<br>\n&gt;keith a work out selfie that i wan supposed to fcukin send to you and you know what it said<br>\n&gt;\u201dBET YOU WANNA LICK THESE NIPS\u201d<br>\n&gt;HUNK I WILL NEVE BE ABLE TO FCE HIM AGAIN I WANT TO DI E</p>\n<p>\n<em> hunk \u2661 is typing\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p><b>hunk \u2661</b><br>\n&gt;did you tell him you sent it on accident?</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to hunk \u2661</em><br>\n&gt;FUCK NO I DIDNT IH NY GOD</p>\n<p>Lance leaves his conversation with Hunk in a rush, ready to send an apology snapchat to Keith reading something like \u2018hey haha funny story i didn't mean to send you a shirtless pic!! and i don't actually think u wanna lick these nips!! that was for hunk please pretend it never happened!!\u2019 but then he sees that the snapchat was already opened, and <em> oh dear god</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<em> snapchat from keith_kogane </em>\n</p>\n<p>Well, Lance thinks he\u2019s lived a good life. He didn't expect to die at the young age of nineteen, but alas, here he is, dying shirtless in the middle of a fucking gym because snapchat had decided to put Keith\u2019s name under the goddamn best friend section. He sucks in a breath, accepts that this is the end, and opens the snapchat.</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith with his lips pressed together and pulled up in a small smile, forehead crinkled and eyebrows raised with his hair up)</em><br>\n&gt;lol</p>\n<p>Lance stares at the snapchat for the full ten seconds it\u2019s there, and then it disappears and he blinks, trying to understand what the hell just happened. He\u2019s still alive, still breathing.</p>\n<p><em> Lol</em>. What does that even mean?! And okay, what the hell is with that hair? And <em> fuck</em>, the selfie in general? Keith never striked Lance as a selfie person, not that Lance had really thought about it much, but damn, even Lance couldn't deny that the guy could take a good selfie! He looked\u2026 fuck, he looked <em> good</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance groans, causing a few people in the gym to look his way. Right, shit, he isn't alone. He ignores their glances and types out a message to Keith.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;so i'm sorry about that last snap!! that was supposed to go to a friend and i clicked your name instead<br>\n&gt;if we could just pretend it never happened that would be pretty neat\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> keith_kogane is typing</em>...</p>\n<p>Come on, fucking Keith Kogane, type faster! Lance is in the middle of a <em> crisis</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;don't worry about it</p>\n<p><em> Oh thank god</em>. Lance lets out a breath, thankful that the world has decided not to end him on this fateful day. Lance\u2019s legacy continues!</p>\n<p><em> keith_kogane is typing</em>...</p>\n<p><em> What?</em> Oh come on! Lance resists the urge to groan again, not wanting the extra attention right now. They don't need to witness his misery.</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;is that the gym on 5th street?</p>\n<p>Wow, okay, that\u2019s definitely not what Lance had been expecting, but that\u2019s a good thing\u2026 he thinks.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;yeah</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;oh cool i usually go there in the mornings</p>\n<p>Lance stares at the words, no idea how he\u2019s supposed to respond to that. Keith goes to the gym! Cool! No surprise there! He probably bench presses way more than Lance. Shit, maybe he should start going to the gym everyday instead of a few times a week.</p>\n<p>Lance types out a few thumbs up emojis and sends them to Keith, putting an end to this embarrassing experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance drops his head onto the counter, regretting staying up until three in the morning last night when he knew he had an 8 hour shift starting at seven in the goddamn morning. He wants to sleep, to curl up under his warm, warm blankets and spend his Sunday dreaming until two in the afternoon. What he doesn\u2019t want is to be working, especially this early, but Lance can\u2019t afford to be picky when it comes to jobs. He needs the money.</p>\n<p>He has to make it through five whole hours before Hunk will come in, like he does every Sunday at noon, to buy coffee and save him from relentless boredom. And <em> okay</em>, it\u2019s not like his job is bad, it\u2019s actually pretty nice when he\u2019s not exhausted, but today isn\u2019t one of those days.</p>\n<p>He hears the bell of the coffee shop door and forces himself up, smiling at the customer like he isn\u2019t currently dead inside. He\u2019s perfected the Lance McClain charm even in this state of exhaustion. It\u2019s one of his many talents.</p>\n<p>People flow in and out in a busy stream, and Lance finds himself thankful because at least now he\u2019s not at such a high risk of falling asleep on the job. Allura would kill him if he ever did that (again). It\u2019s not until nine that he finally gets a moment to stand and do nothing, and he uses that time to check his phone, not really expecting anything, but his eyes widen the second he sees his lockscreen.</p>\n<p>\n<em> snapchat from keith_kogane </em>\n</p>\n<p>Why is Keith snapchatting him?! Maybe he has another question about their class? Lance opens the snap with a sort of urgency, and then he wishes he hadn\u2019t because holy fucking shit it\u2019s a picture of Keith at the gym, the same gym Lance had been at just a couple days ago, and he\u2019s not wearing a shirt and holy moly hell he looks <em> good</em>.</p>\n<p>Lance nearly screenshots the snap before realizing that <em> no</em>, that is a very bad idea, that it is not acceptable to screenshot your classmate\u2019s shirtless selfie when you\u2019ve barely interacted with them!</p>\n<p>Lance glances around the shop, hoping that someone walks up to him in that moment so he\u2019ll have an excuse not to send a snap back, but nope, of course everyone is fine on their own when he needs them most. He lets out a small, distressed sigh before taking a picture to send back.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance making a tired face next to the coffee machine)</em><br>\n&gt;save me from this misery</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith standing in front of a mirror with a black t-shirt and wet hair, his face expressionless and half covered by his phone)</em><br>\n&gt;work?</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance with his elbow on the counter, cheek resting in his hand, side eyeing)</em><br>\n&gt;i prefer to call it hell\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith smiling with a sympathetic expression)</em><br>\n&gt;that bad?</p>\n<p>Lance shakes his head when the snap disappears. <em> Dear lord this boy is pretty</em>. The urge to screenshot his selfies remains strong, but Lance resists.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s holding his phone out in front of him, about to take a picture when he hears someone clear their throat. He looks up to see a middle aged woman standing at the counter, looking incredibly impatient. He hurries to shove his phone away, offering her an apologetic smile as he takes her order.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance is staring up at his ceiling, or more like glaring, and he thinks if he has to do a second more of homework tonight, he\u2019ll fling himself into some black hole that\u2019ll take him far, far away from the stress that is college.</p>\n<p>He rolls over on his side, shoving the books and papers away from him. He doesn\u2019t want to look at them, doesn\u2019t want to think about them. His brain is fried, he\u2019s tired, and his head hurts. Lance makes a pathetic whimpering sound, turning over so he can\u00a0ignore the work he still has to do. It can\u00a0wait until tomorrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance grabs his phone, scrolls through social media, opens snapchat, and decides that life is fucking short so he might as well snapchat Keith, who\u2019d looked annoyingly cute in their Writing 121 class this morning. Stupid Keith and his selfies. Lance had never gotten distracted looking at Keith before, but now he doesn't\u00a0want to tear his eyes away! What an unfortunate situation.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance with his head on his pillow, a hand thrown over his forehead, looking exhausted)</em><br>\n&gt;dropping out of college rip lance mcclain</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith wears a stern expression, his hair a mess)</em><br>\n&gt;go to sleep</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance sticks his tongue out)</em><br>\n<em>&gt;u can\u2019t tell me what to do</em></p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith\u2019s face is barely visible, mostly everything is black)</em><br>\n&gt;oh well i just did</p>\n<p>\n<em> keith_kogane is typing </em>\n</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;i\u2019m going to sleep<br>\n&gt;you should too\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;WELL i guess since u asked so nicely<br>\n&gt;night\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;goodnight</p>\n<p>Lance lets out a sigh, leaning over his bed to pick up his charger from the ground. He plugs his phone in and decides to listen to Keith, dumb Keith and his cute dumb face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lances wakes up the next morning to the sound of his ten o\u2019clock alarm going off, and when he grabs his phone to turn it off, he sees that Keith sent him a snapchat. <em> At seven in the morning</em>.</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith wears a black tank top with grey joggers, standing in front of the gym mirror)</em></p>\n<p>Lance falls to his back on his bed, arms spread out. It\u2019s too early to deal with Keith and his gym selfies, <em> not that he wants them to stop</em>. Oh, he definitely wants them to continue, even if they make Lance feel a little pathetic compared to Keith. The dude is working out at seven in the fucking morning every day and Lance can\u2019t even drag his ass out of bed until ten, and that in itself is quite the task.</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance with his face shoved into his pillow, eyes closed)</em><br>\n&gt;why the fuck were u awake at 7am do u hate urself</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith\u2019s lips pulled up in an amused smile)</em><br>\n&gt;it\u2019s the\u00a0best time to work out</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance with his head still shoved in his pillow)</em><br>\n&gt;ur crazy</p>\n<p>Lance forces his body out of bed, making his way to the shower. The water runs hot down his body, slowly pulling the sleep from him. Ten minutes later he\u2019s standing in front of the half fogged up mirror, looking at his chest and the abs that he barely has. It\u2019s quite the improvement from high school and he\u2019s proud of himself! Yeah, his body might not look as great as Keith\u2019s but Lance still thinks he has a nice body.</p>\n<p>He grins at himself in the mirror, holding up his phone. Shirtless selfies seem to be an acceptable thing between Keith and him.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance shirtless in front of the mirror, the tip of his boxers barely visible, his hair wet)</em><br>\n&gt;i can look good without going to the gym everyday</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(A cup of coffee)</em><br>\n&gt;you look good</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith\u2019s shoulders lifted in a small shrug, smiling innocently)</em><br>\n&gt;but you could look better</p>\n<p>Lance huffs loudly, eyes widening at the snaps. Keith said he looked good! But Keith also said he could look better. It isn\u2019t exactly an insult, but it feels like a challenge, and Lance never turns down a challenge. <em> He\u2019ll show Keith just how good he can look</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Hunk, get in this picture with me,\u201d Lance requests, the two of them sprawled out all over their living room floor, papers everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be studying, Lance, not taking selfies,\u201d Hunk says, but he scooches towards Lance anyway, smiling at the camera.</p>\n<p>Lance taps on the screen, making the filters appear at the bottom. He scrolls through them to the flower crown filter, and Hunk spares him an amused but also fond look before turning his attention back to the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re so cute,\u201d Lance says with a grin as Hunk moves back to his homework.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you sending that to?\u201d Hunk asks while Lance writes a caption.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeith,\u201d Lance replies without thinking, and then he pauses, meeting Hunk\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>Hunk raises an eyebrow, \u201cThe Keith that you\u2026 accidentally sent that one snapchat to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods, keeping his expression nonchalant. \u201cYeah, we snapchat now,\u201d he shrugs, ignoring Hunk\u2019s questioning looks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance knows that if he starts talking about the whole \u201ccasual snapchatting with the cute guy he barely knows\u201d situation, he\u2019ll let the small fact slip that he\u2019s kind of, maybe, just a little, developing a crush on the guy. It\u2019s not Lance\u2019s fault! Keith is <em> pretty</em>, and he has nice eyes, and he\u2019s not entirely bad to talk to.</p>\n<p>Hunk doesn\u2019t press the matter, turning his attention back to his homework, and Lance sends the snap.</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance and Hunk smiling with flower crowns)</em><br>\n&gt;we\u2019re dying bc homework</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith with his hair up, the light making his eyes shine)</em><br>\n&gt;cute</p>\n<p>Okay, <em> okay</em>, holy mother of flip. In a moment of weakness, Lance screenshots the picture, and as much as he wants to regret it he can\u2019t because Keith is so goddamn pretty and oh! Then there\u2019s the fact that he just called Lance cute. And Hunk, too, of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance resists the urge to snapchat back and grabs his computer from next to him. He has an essay to write, pretty boy will have to wait until later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance rubs at his tired eyes, and then he stares at the paper he\u2019s just spent the last three hours working on. He feels himself smiling, re reading the essay one last time before he decides it\u2019s good enough for a grade. It\u2019s the first time in a while he feels genuinely happy with his writing.</p>\n<p>He grabs his phone, which he\u2019s neglected since he started working on the essay, and finds that he has three snapchats and two texts. <em> Well, looks who\u2019s popular now</em>. He looks at the snapchats first, one from Allura and the other two from Keith.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Princess Allura</b><br>\n<em>(Allura with a full face of makeup, including blue glitter and blue lipstick)</em></p>\n<p>Lance screenshots the snap, as he does whenever Allura sends him a selfie. He remembers when he first started his job at the coffee shop, and he\u2019d spent a week trying to hit on her, only for her boyfriend to come in one day and watch Lance make a fool of himself.</p>\n<p>He sighs at the distant memory, glad that Shiro had found amusement in the situation rather than wanting to hit him for hitting on his girlfriend. Lance has since come to like Shiro, making easy conversation with the man whenever he stopped by the shop to see Allura.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s even friends with Allura now, and part of that friendship includes receiving her beautiful selfies. He responds the same way every time, with a pick up line.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Princess Allura</em><br>\n&gt;do you have a map? because i keep getting lost in your eyes</p>\n<p>Lance grins at his own cleverness (or rather, his excellent ability to memorize pick up lines), and opens his snapchats from Keith.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(A blender with the lid to the side, it\u2019s contents all over the place)</em><br>\n&gt;i was making a smoothie but didn\u2019t put the lid on all the way</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith with small dots of smoothie on his cheek and forehead)</em><br>\n&gt;it got on my face</p>\n<p>Lance finds himself laughing out loud, screenshotting the last picture. Keith looks slightly distressed, and it\u2019s <em> adorable</em>.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;thank u for making my night with those snaps</p>\n<p>He\u2019s grinning when he goes to open his messages, the two texts from Pidge.</p>\n<p><b>Pidgeon</b><br>\n&gt;Do you and Hunk want to get lunch tomorrow?<br>\n&gt;I get the day off from school\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;sure pidgeon!!!<br>\n&gt;u wanna come to campus or want us to meet u somewhere?</p>\n<p><b>Pidgeon</b><br>\n&gt;I\u2019ll meet you guys by the food trucks<br>\n&gt;Does 12 work?</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;works w me!!<br>\n&gt;i\u2019ll ask hunk in the morning i\u2019m p sure he\u2019s asleep rn</p>\n<p><b>Pidgeon</b><br>\n&gt;You live with him how hard is it to just check</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;leave me alone pidge i\u2019m tired!!!<br>\n&gt;i\u2019ll see u tomorrow</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment Lance spots Pidge he starts running towards her, leaving an amused Hunk to watch Lance throw his arms around Pidge, picking her up off the ground and spinning her in a circle.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, <em> put me down</em>,\u201d Pidge demands, and Lance follows her order, his expression both apologetic and excited.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in <em> four months</em>, Pidge. I missed you,\u201d Lance says as Hunk comes up to his side, opening his arms for Pidge to walk into. Pidge does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance gasps, taking mock offense. \u201cSo you want to hug him but not me?! I see how it is,\u201d Lance huffs, crossing his arms over his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pidge rolls her eyes, pulling away from the hug. \u201cFirst of all, <em> Hunk didn\u2019t pick me up and spin me around</em>. Second of all\u2026 he gives better hugs.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance wants to deny it, but he knows Hunk\u2019s hugs, he <em> lives </em> for Hunk\u2019s hugs. No one gives better hugs than Hunk, <em> no one</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, come here you two,\u201d Lance stars, gesturing for them to come closer, \u201cTime for a selfie to celebrate our reunion with our special Pidgeon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge groans, but she follows Hunk to Lance\u2019s side anyway, scrunching her face at Lance while the picture is being taken.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Pidge asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to take one on snapchat!\u201d Pidge groans again and Hunk just laughs, used to his friend constantly taking pictures.</p>\n<p>Lance opens snapchat and holds the camera out, taking the picture. \u201cOkay, <em> there</em>, now I\u2019m done.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to his story and keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance smiling with his arm around Hunk, Hunk smiling with his arm around Pidge, Pidge looks like she\u2019s suffering)</em><br>\n&gt;reunited with our cute lil pidgeon \u2661\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance puts his phone in his pocket and turns his attention back to his friends. \u201cOkay!\u201d he shouts excitedly, \u201cWho\u2019s ready for food?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk nods his head eagerly and the three of them wander around the food trucks. Once they\u2019re finally sitting down, Lance and Hunk ask Pidge how her senior year is going.</p>\n<p>The three of them had become friends in sophomore year, when Pidge was a freshman. She was only twelve at the time, having skipped two grades.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d been put in an upper level math class, which was how she met Hunk, and they became friends, and naturally, she soon became friends with Lance too, because no one could be friends with Hunk without also being friends with Lance. They were a package deal!</p>\n<p>She talks about a robotics competition she\u2019s in, and how she\u2019s totally going to kick ass. Lance nods in agreement, and Hunk says they\u2019ll make sure to come to the competition to support her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe school\u2019s finally making a rule that will let trans students use the right restroom,\u201d Pidge informs proudly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really great,\u201d Hunk says. He and Lance had both been apart of the school\u2019s GSA club in high school, and they\u2019d spent a lot of time talking to the school administration about protecting the safety of their trans students.</p>\n<p>Hunk and Lance catch Pidge up on what they\u2019ve been doing, which consists mostly of homework and classes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCollege has made us boring,\u201d Lance sighs dramatically, dropping his head in his hands. \u201cI was supposed to do things! Party it up! Instead I\u2019m always in my room or at the library or at <em> work</em>. It\u2019s killing my game. How am I supposed to spread the Lance McClain charm if I\u2019m always doing <em> homework?</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt hasn't ruined all your game,\u201d Hunk says casually, and Lance shoots him daggers, knowing exactly what he\u2019s talking about. Of course Hunk has to bring that up <em> now</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pidge raises an eyebrow, \u201cLance, you never had game in the first place.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance scowls. \u201cI\u2019m loved by all!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pidge rolls her eyes, but she doesn't disagree with him. Lance grins.</p>\n<p>They talk for a while longer until Hunk and Lance have to go, and unlike earlier, Lance asks this time, \u201cPidge, am I allowed to give you a goodbye hug?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince you asked, why not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance throws his arms around her happily, squeezing her tight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, I can\u2019t <em> breath</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance only loosens his hold a little. \u201cYou better text us, Pidgeon. We miss you. It\u2019s not the same without you.\u201d He finally lets go of her, and she\u2019s biting back a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here next year,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's not soon enough,\u201d Lance argues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to deal with it,\u201d Pidge shrugs, and then she turns to Hunk, letting him wrap her in his arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance spends the rest of the day smiling and full of energy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Allura!\u201d Lance greets when he walks into work, all smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Allura tells him, staring at him blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy <em> two minutes</em>,\u201d Lance says, \u201cAnd besides, how could you stay mad at me when I\u2019m your favorite employee?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura snorts. \u201cFavorite? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods, \u201cI keep things interesting. You\u2019d get bored without me here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura stares at him for a moment, expression unmoving, and then she nods in agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it would get boring if I didn\u2019t get a chance to watch your sad attempts at flirting with the customers.\u201d She makes a small, <em> obviously fake </em> laugh and smiles widely before turning around and leaving Lance to squeak in protest about how his flirting is the <em> best</em>, and how dare she imply anything but!</p>\n<p>He shakes his head with a loud huff, but he forgets all about Allura\u2019s implications when someone walks inside the shop and up to the counter. He takes her order, chatting while he makes her drink. Lance is good at making conversation, and even Allura can\u2019t deny he\u2019s good at pulling in regulars.</p>\n<p>Six hours later his shift ends and he\u2019s sitting on the bus, heading back to his apartment. He puts his music on and gets a snapchat from Keith only a few seconds after. It brings a smile to his face.</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n<em>(Keith\u2019s hand is on his cheek, pulling downward, he looks exhausted)</em><br>\n&gt;i\u2019ve been doing math for four hours</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;dude u look like shit<br>\n&gt;i mean don't get me wrong u still look good<br>\n&gt;but yea u look like shit\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>keith_kogane is typing\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;thanks for pointing out the obvious<br>\n&gt;i\u2019m not even finished but it doesn't make any sense</p>\n<p>Lance sends his response before he really has a chance to consider what he\u2019s offering.</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;do u want help?</p>\n<p>And then it hits him that, shit, he was inadvertently asking Keith to hang out. The only time they ever see\u00a0each other outside of snapchat is\u00a0in the one class they share, and even there it isn't\u00a0like they actually interact! Lance starts worrying, afraid that he\u2019s crossed a boundary, afraid that\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em> keith_kogane is typing\u2026 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Lance expects Keith to turn him down, probably with a polite \u2018thanks for the offer but i\u2019ll figure it out myself.\u201d He gets the exact opposite.</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;wait really?<br>\n&gt;that would be great if you had the time</p>\n<p>Lance stares at the words for longer than necessary, checking to make sure they say what he thinks they say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels a sense of excitement as he types out a reply. Lance had gotten used to sending Keith random snapchats throughout the day, and Keith sending them back. The idea of actually spending time with him in person is\u2026 a little nerve wracking, but in a good way.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;i can make the time for u ;-)<br>\n&gt;what math are you taking?\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;111\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;ok cool i can definitely help u<br>\n&gt;wanna meet up tomorrow?</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;yeah<br>\n&gt;does 1 work for you?\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;yeah but i\u2019ll only have an hour</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;that's fine</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;better not slack off cuz i won't go easy on u ;;-)</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;wouldn't expect anything less\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance could just end the conversation there, but he kind of <em> enjoys </em> talking to Keith and he still has almost ten minutes left on the bus, <em> so </em>\u2026</p>\n<p><b>lance </b> <em> to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;what's ur major btw?\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;double majoring in dance and studio art</p>\n<p>Lance is pretty sure his entire heart stops, thinking about Keith fucking <em> dancing</em>.

Lance is fine, he\u2019s totally, one hundred percent fine, and definitely not dying over the fact that a beautiful boy is sitting next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Keith says, pulling his books from his backpack and setting them on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh, what\u2019s confusing you?\u201d Lance questions, and then they dive straight into the math. Lance promised not to go easy, after all, and he\u2019s a man of his word.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hour flies by, and Lance has a surprisingly good time considering all they\u2019re doing is math. Lance only gets caught staring once, and when Keith asks what he\u2019s looking at, Lance\u2019s smart response is to say \u2018Just wondering how someone who woke up at six in the morning doesn\u2019t have bags under their eyes.\u201d Keith rolls his eyes and says it\u2019s because <em> he </em> actually knows what a decent bedtime is.</p>\n<p>They start packing up at 2:01, and Lance grins as he stands up, placing his hands on his hips. \u201cSo, am I the best tutor ever or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith looks at him, shrugs, and says, \u201cYou weren\u2019t bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, I rock your math world and that's all I get?\u201d Lance lets out a distressed sigh, putting a hand over his heart and looking into the distance. \u201cI feel so under appreciated.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keith chuckles, and <em> what the fuck</em>, he needs to do that again right now because that was probably one of the cutest sounds Lance has heard in his entire life. \u201cI appreciate you enough to ask if you wouldn\u2019t mind doing this again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance perks up, and then he remembers that he\u2019s got to keep his cool, pretend that he\u2019s totally not psyched about getting to hang out with Keith again. Ha, Keith who? He couldn\u2019t care less about that guy.</p>\n<p>Lance puts a hand\u00a0on the table\u00a0next to him, leaning his weight to one side. \u201cMy services are ten dollars an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith\u2019s face drops, and Lance has to be making up the disappointment in his expression. Is he disappointed? Wait, could he be disappointed about not getting to hang out with Lance? No, that\u2019s stupid. He\u2019s probably just disappointed because he wanted a free tutor. Mixed with the disappointment is confusion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d Keith starts to say, but gets cut off by Lance\u2019s laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m fucking with you. I\u2019m totally all for helping you out again.\u201d Lakes shakes his head, letting out one last laugh. He doesn\u2019t miss the way Keith\u2019s expression relaxes, and he wears what could <em> almost </em> be a smile. \u201cBut uh, I like, gotta go right now otherwise I\u2019ll be late to class so\u00a0I\u2019ll snapchat you later and we can work out a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith nods, says a quick goodbye, and then Lance is off, feeling ready to defeat the rest of his day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They slip into a routine after the first day in the library. At first it\u2019s just Lance helping Keith out with math, but after a week of meeting up they start working on their own things, Lance blabbing away about his classes while Keith half listens and half works. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s convenient, and Lance really doesn\u2019t want it to stop.</p>\n<p>They still snapchat, they\u2019re currently at a 37 day snap streak, only now their relationship doesn\u2019t just extend to being \u201cbest friends\u201d on snapchat. They\u2019re actually friends! In real life! The only problem: being friends with Keith in real life and getting to know him is turning this <em> little </em> crush of his into a <em> big </em> crush. It was easier when Keith was just a pretty face he snapchatted, but now Keith is a pretty face who he not only snapchats, but also hangs out with on a regular basis!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance also has Keith\u2019s schedule practically memorized, almost more so than Hunk\u2019s and he <em> lives </em> with Hunk! But Keith is a busy person, and since Lance now monopolizes most of his free time, or at least his study time, since Keith never really had much <em> free time </em> to begin with, he has to know when Keith is available. Surprisingly, their schedules work nicely around each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Lance breaths out a sigh, \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I need a break.\u201d He leans down onto\u00a0the table, arms spread out and his head in between them. It\u2019s a Saturday and they\u2019ve been working for the past five hours, and Lance is pretty sure death is coming for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to get something to eat?\u201d Keith asks, and Lance\u2019s head shoots right the fuck up.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve never done anything outside of school work and snapchatting. Getting food together would be adding a whole new aspect to their friendship, and Lance is all about anything that means spending more time with Keith.</p>\n<p>He nods slowly, like he didn\u2019t just have to stop himself from shouting out an immediate yes. Lance has got to be chill about this, act like getting something to eat with the guy he\u2019s crushing on isn\u2019t a big fucking deal. \u201cSure, sounds good,\u201d he says, and then mentally congratulates himself on a job well done. <em> Totally chill</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d Keith asks, picking his things\u00a0up from the table and stuffing it in his bag. Lance follows suit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, food trucks?\u201d Lance suggests. That\u2019s usually his go to option.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Keith agrees, zipping up his bag and tossing it onto his shoulders. They walk out of the library in silence, and Lance suddenly feels nervous. This is new territory for them. It\u2019s easier in the library, where they have their work to fall back onto, but now Lance doesn\u2019t have that crutch.</p>\n<p>Lance is used to charming people, he\u2019s used to flirting, but that\u2019s with people who he has nothing to lose. If a stranger rejects him, Lance can just hop into Hunk\u2019s bed and complain, and Hunk will run a hand through Lance\u2019s hair and console him, and <em> boom</em>, stranger forgotten.</p>\n<p>Keith isn\u2019t a stranger. Keith is his friend, a friend who he happens to really like, and he doesn\u2019t want to mess it up. He doesn\u2019t want to lose the gym selfies Keith sends every morning, or the daily study sessions, or Keith letting him ramble about his family when his mind shuts off and he can no longer work. He\u2019s gotten used to all those things, and he doesn\u2019t want to get used to not having them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how\u2019s practice for the dance concert going?\u201d Lance asks as they walk, swallowing down his nerves. Lance is good at making conversation! He can do this! \u201cYou have to go tonight, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, practice every night except Sundays,\u201d Keith tells him. \u201cIt\u2019s going well. We have all our dances set for the concert so now we just have to practice them,\u201d he pauses, looking somewhat hesitant, before adding, \u201cI actually, uh, helped choreograph one of the dances.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cReally?\u201d he asks, not hiding the awe from his voice. Keith nods. \u201cDude, that\u2019s so cool. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m missing your concert. I really want to see you dance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith keeps his eyes in front of him, not looking at Lance, but he can still see the smile he\u2019s wearing. Lance wishes he would smile more because <em> goddamn </em> is it pretty, especially when his smile reaches his eyes. That\u2019s enough to make Lance\u2019s heart skip a pathetic beat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re gonna be there,\u201d Keith says, and then their conversation is stopped by their arrival at the food trucks.</p>\n<p>The rest of the afternoon goes by smoothly, and Lance finds himself forgetting that he was ever nervous in the first place. They talk about school, mostly, why they chose their majors, how their classes are going, which professors they love and which they hate.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s natural, and Lance wants to do it again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Huuuuunk</em>, this is a <em> crisis</em>,\u201d Lance whines, leaning over the counter so he can take Hunk\u2019s hands in his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a crisis?\u201d Shiro asks, coming out of the backroom with Allura. Shiro doesn\u2019t even <em> work </em> here and yet he\u2019s allowed to go anywhere. Perks of dating the boss.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, don\u2019t get him started again,\u201d Hunk pleads, but it\u2019s too late, because Lance is already talking.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Okay</em>,\u201d Lance starts, taking a breath. \u201cSo I started snapchatting this guy, like, over a month ago, and it was fun, he sent me hot shirtless gym selfies. Who doesn\u2019t want to get those, right? But now we\u2019re <em> friends </em> and we hang out almost every day, and ugh, he\u2019s so cute,\u201d Lance turns to Hunk, \u201cRight Hunk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s attractive,\u201d Hunk agrees with a shrug, and Lance goes right back to his story, Shiro and Allura sharing an amused glance. It\u2019s a good thing Sunday afternoons are slow.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt first it was just like \u2018oh yeah, this guy is really pretty, I totally wouldn\u2019t mind making out with him\u2019 but now I want to do more than just make out with him!\u201d Shiro and Allura both give him a look, and Lance huffs, shaking his head, \u201cNot like <em> that</em>. I mean I wanna, like, take him out. <em> On a date</em>.\u201d Shiro\u2019s face softens, and Allura just looks amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why is this a crisis?\u201d Allura asks.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Because he doesn\u2019t like me. </em> I know, shocking, what\u2019s not to like? I\u2019m attractive, smart, and I\u2019ll totally treat you right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Lance would make a great boyfriend,\u201d Hunk pipes up, and Lance looks lovingly into his best friend\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Awwww</em>, Hunk. I love you. Why can\u2019t I just like you instead? We would make the best couple.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk laughs, and he\u2019s wearing the cutest blush that Lance just <em> adores</em>. \u201cWe would make a pretty good couple.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance sighs, loud and dramatic, staring off into the distance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shiro clears his throat. \u201cHow do you know he doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I don\u2019t know</em>,\u201d Lance says truthfully, \u201cI just get that <em> feeling</em>. And I don\u2019t even know if he likes guys!\u201d Relationships and sexuality weren\u2019t something Keith and Lance had ever talked about.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could always just\u2026 ask?\u201d Shiro suggests, and Lance shakes his head, sighing.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Or</em>,\u201d Lance begins, \u201cI can just ignore the problem until it eventually goes away.\u201d</p>\n<p>His friends all give him <em> the look </em> that means they think that\u2019s a bad idea, but none of them try to argue. It\u2019s not like Lance would listen to them, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Keith tells him before walking off, and Lance watches until he disappears from view, and maybe his gaze rests on Keith\u2019s ass for a few seconds longer than necessary but there's no proof of that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to dive into his physics homework when he notices Keith\u2019s red zip up hoodie still sitting around, and he grins, moving to pick it up and put it on. His physics homework can wait.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>(Lance wearing Keith\u2019s red sweater, flashing a peace sign)</em><br>\n&gt;look what you forgot</p>\n<p>\n<em> keith_kogane is typing\u2026 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Lance waits for the inevitable \u201ccan you bring that to me tomorrow\u201d reply but instead he gets\u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;that looks good on you</p>\n<p>Lance makes a quiet whimpering noise because it\u2019s not <em> fair </em> that Keith can just go around saying stuff like that, making Lance\u2019s insides feel like putty!</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to keith_kogane</em><br>\n&gt;i\u2019ll bring it back to you tomorrow</p>\n<p><b>keith_kogane</b><br>\n&gt;it's fine if you don't i have others<br>\n&gt;you can give it back whenever</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s physics homework is completely forgotten, the only thing occupying Lance\u2019s mind being the fact that Keith is letting him keep his sweatshirt. Not permanently, but <em> still!</em></p>\n<p>And oh god, it <em> smells </em> like Keith and this is not doing anything to help the whole crush situation. He\u2019s supposed to be ignoring it but that\u2019s kind of difficult when he\u2019s wearing the guy\u2019s jacket for christ sake! Sure, he could just return it tomorrow, but Keith had said he didn't mind him borrowing it and Lance is <em> weak</em>.</p>\n<p>Lance doesn't reply to the snap, but what he does do is click on Keith\u2019s username, giving him the option to change Keith\u2019s snapchat name.</p>\n<p><em>Edit name for keith_kogane</em><br>\n<em>New Name </em> \u00a0<br>\n<b>Pretty Boy</b></p>\n<p>He clicks save and then remembers that he has actual shit to get done.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance shifts, annoyed about the fact that this is the first time in a while he\u2019s managed to get to bed at a reasonable time but it\u2019s not going to make any different because <em> he can't fucking sleep</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been trying for an hour now, and honestly it feels like a waste of time. If he\u2019s not going to sleep he might as well <em> do </em> something. He grabs his phone, scrolls through his apps until he finds himself opening snapchat.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little past twelve in the morning, he doubts Keith will be awake right now, but he sends a snap anyway. Worth a shot.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;are u awake?</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em> to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n<em>(Lance with his arm over his face, flash on)</em><br>\n&gt;i can't sleep</p>\n<p>Lance closes the app and and checks his other social media, and he's watching a puppy video on facebook when he gets the notification.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Pretty Boy is typing... </em>\n</p>\n<p>It sends a nervous excitement through him, but he ignores that in favor of grinning over Keith\u2019s new name.</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;i just finished up some homework<br>\n&gt;want me to stay up with you?\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> No, no, no</em>.

Oh shit, what if he\u2019s been obvious without realizing it? Lance is about to think about all of his past interactions with Keith when he gets a snapchat.</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;it\u2019s a mystery</p>\n<p>Oh god, nope, Lance\u2019s heart is not cut out for this. So much for ignoring the problem until it goes away. The problem is getting bigger! The problem is Keith flirts <em> back!</em> Lance isn't dumb, he knows it\u2019s just Keith playing along with him, but <em> man </em> it still makes Lance melt.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;do u like space</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;yeah\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;what do u like about it</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;i guess...the vastness of it?<br>\n&gt;i like that it's so big and we don't know all that's out there<br>\n&gt;like the aliens</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;oh my god<br>\n&gt;OF COURSE YOU WOULD BELIEVE IN ALIENS</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;you don't?\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;not really</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;how can you not believe when we know so little about what's out there?</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;dude<br>\n&gt;i think that's the deepest thing u\u2019ve ever said to me</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;there\u2019s a documentary about it you should watch<br>\n&gt;you\u2019d like it</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;..............a documentary<br>\n&gt;..........about aliens<br>\n&gt;oh my god<br>\n&gt;oh my god keith do u watch conspiracy theories</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;why would you assume i watch conspiracy theories just because i've seen a documentary about aliens<br>\n&gt;it's a really cool documentary</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;u haven't denied it</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;well\u2026</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;oH MY GOD<br>\n&gt;KEITH</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;shut up they're interesting</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;i can't believe u<br>\n&gt;i\u2019ll watch the alien documentary tho<br>\n&gt;but only if you watch it with me</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;i have time on sunday</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;i work until\u00a05<br>\n&gt;but i'm free anytime after that<br>\n&gt;u can come over?</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;okay</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;yeah<br>\n&gt;god i can't believe i'm gonna watch a documentary about aliens<br>\n&gt;the things i do for pretty boys</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;pretty?</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n&gt;don't try to deny ur good looks keith<br>\n&gt;it won't work<br>\n&gt;i have eyes</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;whatever you say then</p>\n<p>They talk until three in the morning, about space, their favorite movies, what they want to do after college. It\u2019s the most they\u2019ve ever talked and Lance wants more. He wants to talk to Keith about more than just their school work. Hell, he wants to hear all about those ridiculous conspiracy theory documentaries he watches if that\u2019s what Keith wants to talk about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance sighs as he rolls over in bed, sleep finding him easily. The last thought on his mind before he crashes is that this crush of his isn't something he can ignore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance is leaning against the counter at work, his head resting in his hand. It\u2019s only thirty minutes into his shift and he\u2019s already bored. He hears the jingle of the opening doors and thinks, thank god, at least now he has something to do.</p>\n<p>He lifts his head, eyes widening at what he sees, because standing a few feet away from the counter is <em> Keith</em>, who\u2019s looking at him with an expression mirroring Lance\u2019s. What the hell is Keith doing here?!</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Lance tries, clearing his throat. \u201cHey. I didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Keith says back, resuming his short walk to the counter. There\u2019s an awkwardness in the air that Lance would kill to get rid of. \u201cSo\u2026 you work here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Lance nods, and he tries to say something else, he really does, but nothing comes. They stand there for a moment in an uncomfortable silence, and then Keith <em> smiles.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI go here every morning after the gym,\u201d Keith tells him, and just like that the awkward air between them disappears, and Lance wants to sing out in gratitude.</p>\n<p>Instead, he asks, \u201cSo why are you here now? <em> Not that I don\u2019t want you here</em>. I was actually bored off my ass until you walked in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith\u2019s eyes shift to the counter and then back up. \u201cI, uh, slept in. So I didn\u2019t work out today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You slept in</em>?\u201d Lance asks, as if this is the craziest thing he\u2019s heard all week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026 oh my god, stop looking at me like that. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be taking my order?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance grins, resting a hand on the counter and using it to perk himself up. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d He asks, voice smooth, maybe a little flirtatious.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance does a playful wiggle with his upper body and says, \u201cOne black coffee coming right up.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything for my favorite customer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance notices Keith roll his eyes and bite back a smile before he turns around to make the drink, his boredom long gone now. He writes Keith\u2019s name on the cup, and then he pauses in consideration.</p>\n<p>Before he can chicken out, Lance scribbles his phone number under Keith\u2019s name, along with the words, \u201cText me ;)\u201d. Despite how often they hang out and snapchat, they\u2019ve still never exchanged numbers.</p>\n<p>He spins back to the counter, holding the cup out to Keith, who takes it, and then-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeith?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance whirls around, seeing Allura and Shiro, and now Shiro\u2019s walking over to Keith like he knows him. How does he know him?!</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey Shiro,\u201d Keith says with familiarity, making Lance even more eager to understand what the hell is going on right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here at this time,\u201d Shiro says, like he knows when Keith usually comes in. <em> Why would he know that? Are they friends? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to come in this morning so I\u2019m just dropping by before class,\u201d Keith informs. \u201cI should actually get going.\u201d He turns to Lance then, who has to pretend he wasn\u2019t just staring at them with wide, confused eyes. <em> Act normal Lance</em>. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Lance,\u201d Keith says with a little wave before turning back to Shiro to say goodbye to him as well.</p>\n<p>Lance notices Shiro\u2019s slightly confused expression as well, and then his eyes widen at something and Lance is trying to figure out what, and he follows Shiro\u2019s gaze and <em> oh god.</em>\u00a0Shiro is looking at the cup. The cup where Lance wrote his <em> number.</em></p>\n<p>Shiro turns to Lance when Keith leaves, eyes narrowed. \u201cDid you write your number on Keith\u2019s cup?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance swallows, feeling extremely nervous under Shiro\u2019s gaze. \u201cMaybe?\u201d He says, shoulders slouching in, making him smaller. \u201cHow do you know him, anyway?\u201d Lance asks, his curiosity getting the best of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother,\u201d Shiro informs, and Lance\u2019s world stops. \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, he\u2019s your <em> brother.\"</em></p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s expression changes to worry, and he takes a step closer to Lance. \u201cYeah, uh, Lance? Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I have a crush on your brother, </em> \u201d Lance says, and then he realizes what he\u2019s just said. Out loud. In front of Shiro. Keith\u2019s brother. \u201cShit, <em> oh my god</em>, you are not allowed to tell him that. Shiro, please don\u2019t tell him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s eyes widen, and then his face begins to relax into understanding. \u201cThe guy you were talking about last time? You were talking about Keith?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods, because that\u2019s all he\u2019s capable of right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to look so terrified. I\u2019m not going to tell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance lets out a loud breath of relief, dropping a hand on the counter for support. \u201cOh thank god,\u201d Lance breaths, but then Shiro has to go and ruin it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I think you should tell him.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! Now way! That\u2019s a horrible idea,\u201d A pause, \u201cWait. Does that mean he likes guys?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t already figured that out on your own.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?!\u201d Lance demands, but Shiro just shrugs, says he has to go, leans in to give Allura a kiss and then leaves Lance with a million questions. Lance turns to Allura, desperate, \u201cAllura,\u201d he starts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nope</em>,\u201d Allura interjects, \u201cI have to work. <em> And so do you</em>.\u201d Allura nods her head in the direction of the customer waiting for him.</p>\n<p>Well, this is just great.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance is finishing up his shift when he gets a text.</p>\n<p><b>Unknown Number</b><br>\n&gt;I can\u2019t believe you wrote your number on my cup</p>\n<p>Lance grins, typing back a fast reply.</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;well ur texting me so it obviously worked\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;Does it usually work?\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;ur actually the first person i\u2019ve done it for</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;Really?</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;i was gonna do it once when i first started work but allura threatened to fire me<br>\n&gt;i dont think she was serious but she is SCARY<br>\n&gt;dont worry, u were worth the risk \u2764</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;How sweet</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;SOOO\u2026.shiro\u2019s ur brother</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;Yeah</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;i flirted with allura in front of him<br>\n&gt;before i knew he was her boyfriend<br>\n&gt;i thought he was gonna kill me but he just laughed</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;That sounds like Shiro<br>\n&gt;And that also sounds like you<br>\n&gt;I actually have to go I just wanted to text you so you\u2019d have my number</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt; AW YOU WANTED ME TO HAVE UR NUMBER\u00a0 ,\u2019;^)<br>\n&gt;NIGHT NIGHT KEITHY KEITH</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance is in class, waiting for the professor to show up. He decides to pass the time by taking selfies, after all, he\u2019s looking particularly good today.</p>\n<p>He takes a few photos on his camera app before opening snapchat. It would be rude to deprive Keith of his beauty.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em> to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n<em>(Lance with the dog filter, smiling with his hand resting on his chin)</em></p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s professor walks in then, and Lance puts his phone away. He can\u2019t afford to be\u00a0distracted in this class.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mind feels exhausted by the end of the lecture, and he pulls his phone out as he gets up, eyes bulging when he sees the notification waiting for him on his lockscreen.</p>\n<p><em> Pretty Boy screenshotted your photo </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Holy shit</em>. Lance has screenshotted a few of Keith\u2019s photos now, but this is the first time Keith has screenshotted one of <em>his</em> photos. That\u2019s not even all though, because he still has an unopened snapchat from Keith.</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n&gt;cute\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s heart floats from his chest, and he gets a giddy excited feeling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite style of dance?\u201d Lance asks after they\u2019ve spent two\u00a0hours working on their essays for Writing 121 and are in desperate need of a break.</p>\n<p>\u201cContemporary,\u201d Keith replies without hesitation, and Lance leans forward, elbows on the table, head in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you like about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith\u2019s expression turns thoughtful, and he takes a moment before answering. \u201cEverything else goes away\u2026 when I\u2019m dancing, I have more confidence. It helps me express things that I can\u2019t with words.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d Lance says, smiling softly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want,\u201d Keith hesitates, \u201cDo you want to see?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou dance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah..\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance nods as quick as he can, because holy shit does he want to see. \u201cYes, oh my god, dude, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have videos on my computer,\u201d Keith turns to\u00a0the laptop sitting on the table in front of him, and then he leans down in his bag, grabbing earphones. He plugs them into the computer and then gives one headphone to Lance, who takes it eagerly and watches Keith open his videos.</p>\n<p>Keith clicks on a video, and Lance has to do a double take because <em>holy crow</em> <em>Allura is on the screen with Keith</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that Allura?!\u201d Lance asks in shock before Keith can start the video.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah. She used to be a dancer. She\u2019s still really good\u2026 she runs a dance camp for kids during the summer.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance shakes his head in disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s super fucking cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith\u2019s lip perks up. \u201cShe taught me a lot when I was younger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How long have you known her</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince middle school. She was in high school with Shiro and they started dating.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d Lance says, and makes a mental note to ask Allura about her dancing at work tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna start the video now,\u201d Keith tells him, and Lance locks his eyes on the computer, the song \u201cGive Me Love\u201d by Ed Sheeran beginning to play. Keith is wearing a grey shirt that leaves some of his chest exposed, and <em> shorts</em>. <em> He\u2019s wearing shorts</em>. Lance has only ever seen Keith in jeans or joggers, but <em> holy moly my </em> the shorts are a good look.</p>\n<p>Lance feels his chest bubble with some emotion he can\u2019t place, but it feels really good, watching Keith dance. He smiles without realizing it, eyes not wandering from the screen until the video stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Lance breaths, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool. You\u2019re really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a dance major, so I have to be,\u201d Keith says with a shrug, but Lance notices the ghost of a smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there more?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to watch more?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, <em> duh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith gives him a look that Lance thinks means Keith didn\u2019t expect him to want to see more, which is crazy, because Lance could watch these videos all day.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, sure,\u201d Keith agrees, and Lance inwardly celebrates.</p>\n<p>The next thirty minutes is spent watching videos of Keith dance, and the few times Lance takes his eyes off the screen to glance at Keith, he finds that Keith\u2019s eyes are already on him. That does silly things to his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lance starts after Keith tells him they\u2019ve watched all the videos Keith has on his laptop. \u201cYou must be really flexible.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Between the awe and admiration he\u2019d felt while watching those videos was something else, something more along the lines of imagining Keith\u2019s body up against his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014um\u2014yeah,\u201d Keith says, and Lance keeps himself from sighing out loud at the thought of Keith\u2019s flexibility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I see your art?\u201d Lance asks suddenly, because it\u2019s a question he\u2019s been wanting to ask for a while now but has never had the nerves. Now seems like the perfect opportunity, until he notices the way Keith\u2019s face drops.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually share my art with people,\u201d Keith says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Lance reassures, not wanting to make Keith feel bad. As much as he wants to see it, he understands it\u2019s personal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance guides the conversation elsewhere for the next twenty minutes, talking about high school, his friends, and maybe he includes a few embarrassing stories at his expense for the sole purpose of making Keith laugh. And then Keith has to leave for work and Lance is left smiling dumbly at the library table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance is on his bed suffering through endless physics homework when his phone lights up with a text, and he considers ignoring it for a second and actually being a good student but then he sees it\u2019s from Keith and also\u2026 it\u2019s a picture message. That catches Lance\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p>He picks up his phone, slides the text open, and then forgets to breath because there\u2019s a picture of him, surrounded by space. And holy shit. Holy fuck. <em> Holy mother of crow.</em>\u00a0He\u2019s wearing Keith\u2019s red jacket that he hasn\u2019t given back yet. Lance is pretty sure his heart stops, or maybe it beats faster, all he knows is that he\u2019s feeling a lot of things all at once.</p>\n<p>With the picture is a text, that Lance hadn\u2019t noticed until now because he\u2019d been too busy <em> dying </em> of pure happiness and shock and awe.</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;I didn\u2019t plan on showing you this when I drew it but you said you wanted to see my art so yeah</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;this is the best day of my entire life<br>\n&gt;i have literally never been happier<br>\n&gt;I DONT EVEN HAVE WORDS KEITH<br>\n&gt;YOU HAVE MADE ME SPEECHLESS</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;What an accomplishment<br>\n&gt;So you like it?</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;KEITH<br>\n&gt;KEITH BUDDY<br>\n&gt;MY MAN<br>\n&gt;MY DUDE<br>\n&gt;I AM IN //LOVE// WITH IT</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;Well I\u2019m gonna go to bed now<br>\n&gt;I\u2019m meeting you after work tomorrow right?</p>\n<p><b>Lance</b><br>\n&gt;YEAH<br>\n&gt;and then we\u2019ll ride the bus to my apartment<br>\n&gt;and watch ur lame alien documentary<br>\n&gt;hunk might be there?? he\u2019ll be in his room if he is<br>\n&gt;GOODNIGHT KEITH</p>\n<p><b>Keith</b><br>\n&gt;Goodnight Lance<br>\n&gt;I\u2019ll see you tomorrow<br>\n&gt;You\u2019re gonna like the documentary</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Lance exhales, because he\u2019s completely and utterly screwed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things that don\u2019t make a crush go away: <em> your crush sending you a picture they drew of you.</em>\u00a0Things that make a crush stronger: <em> your crush sending you a picture they drew of you</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s shift ends in ten minutes, and during those ten minutes he needs to figure out a way to chill his goddamn heart, which won\u2019t stop speeding up at the thought of Keith, the thought of his dancing, of his smile, of the way his eyes crinkle when he laughs, <em> of the drawing</em>. Lance can\u2019t stop thinking about the drawing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance knows he\u2019s attractive. Sure, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s half as attractive as he leads people to believe, with the endless compliments he gives himself, but he knows he\u2019s good looking to some degree. But the way Keith drew him, smiling in the middle of space, that makes Lance feel beautiful. <em> Is that how Keith sees him? </em></p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t entertain the thought of Keith liking him <em> like that</em>. Lance used to get his hopes up all the time, but no one was ever serious about him. They\u2019d flirt back because he was entertaining, because he kept them amused, but no one had any interest beyond that. Lance was used to rejection, but he really, really doesn\u2019t want to be rejected by Keith.</p>\n<p>He decides his only solution is to shove his feelings deep down, but that plan goes out the fucking window the moment Keith walks through the coffee shop doors. It feels exactly like a scene from some cheesy romcom. <em> Queue: pretty person walking through door, hair blowing to the side. Queue: hopeless romantic pining from afar. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Keith greets, and Lance never stood a chance.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lance says back, and fuck, he\u2019s staring. He forces his eyes away from Keith, away from that unfairly beautiful face. \u201cI\u2019m almost done here. Just give me a second to get my stuff.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Keith nods, leaning against the counter, and Lance rushes off to the back, ignoring his heart that keeps saying in beats: Ask! Keith! Out! His heart can shove it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heading out?\u201d Allura asks as Lance is taking off his work apron.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, shifts over. Gonna go watch an <em> alien documentary </em> with Keith.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t tell her is that he might not make it to work on Monday because he\u2019s not sure his heart can handle sitting through an entire documentary with Keith without completely bursting out of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem nervous,\u201d Allura observes.</p>\n<p>Lance laughs, but there\u2019s no humor to it. \u201cMe? Nervous? Ha, no way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should take Shiro\u2019s advice,\u201d Allura suggests, and before he can tell her what a bad idea that is she\u2019s walking away. Lance sighs.</p>\n<p>Alright, time to face Keith. He can do this. Nothing to worry about. <em> Everything is good</em>, except everything is not good because apparently all it takes for his stomach to get all fluttery is Keith just standing there, with his back to Lance.</p>\n<p>Lance swallows down the urge to bolt and slides up next to Keith, offering a grin. \u201cReady to have an exce<em>lance </em> time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith actually smiles at that, and then it turns playful. \u201cOh, I\u2019m ready for a marve<em>lance </em> time.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that right there is the exact moment Lance falls in love with Keith.</p>\n<p>Okay, not really, Lance isn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019s known Keith long enough to fall in love, but it feels pretty damn close there for a second because not only did Keith not make fun of Lance for his lame ass joke,\u00a0<em>but he made one back.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, Lance has to admit it\u2019s an interesting documentary.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you were right,\u201d Lance says casually, \u201cI actually really liked it.\u201d He still doesn\u2019t believe in aliens, but hey, Keith is more than welcome to show him more documentaries in order to sway him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He glances at Keith, who\u2019s beaming, and now he can\u2019t turn away. Why does he have to be so pretty? <em> Why does his smile have to make Lance\u2019s insides turn all mushy? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you would,\u201d Keith says, to which Lance nudges Keith\u2019s thigh with his foot. He\u2019s sitting at the opposite side of the couch, back against the side, legs spread out over the cushions. During the documentary, he\u2019d had his legs over Keith\u2019s lap, which had proved to be somewhat of a minor distraction, especially when Keith put his arms on them.</p>\n<p>Keith nudges his feet with his elbow, and Lance nudges back, and then Keith is swinging his feet onto the couch and they\u2019re caught in the middle of some ridiculous nudging war, which comes to an immediate halt the second Lance\u2019s hand lands on Keith\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>Keith has his back pressed up against the side of the couch, and Lance\u2019s is hovering over him, the hand that\u2019s currently on Keith\u2019s thigh supporting his weight. Neither of them move. Lance\u2019s heart is freaking banging against his chest, and he tries to control his breathing.</p>\n<p><em> Come on Lance! Just move! Move and then laugh this off! </em> But he can\u2019t move because Keith is looking at him with an expression he can\u2019t read and his eyes are so beautiful and Lance finds himself glancing at his lips before he can stop himself and then\u2014</p>\n<p><em>Holy fucking mother of fuck</em>, and then Keith is diving forward, grabbing Lance\u2019s face and pushing their lips together. Their lips! Which means they\u2019re kissing! <em> He\u2019s kissing Keith</em>. Or more like, Keith is kissing him because Lance is too stunned to react, and then he realizes, for a second time, that holy shit Keith is kissing him and he needs to kiss back <em> right now!</em></p>\n<p>He thrusts forward, not prepared for the friction that\u2019ll cause, letting out a small moan, which only seems to motivate Keith further, who now has his hands in Lance\u2019s hair, pulling him closer, as if they weren\u2019t already close enough (They weren\u2019t.)</p>\n<p>Lance runs his hand up Keith\u2019s shirt without thinking, and Keith bucks his hips up which causes them both to moan and oh my god, Lance could come just listening to that sound. Alright, he\u2019s being a little dramatic but Lance wants to hear that again! He wants to keep hearing it! He wants to be the reason Keith makes that sound!</p>\n<p>Lance somehow manages, with great strength on his part, to get his lips away from Keith\u2019s, moving them to Keith\u2019s neck instead so he can suck at the skin, leave a mark as a reminder that this actually fucking happened. Keith makes that little noise again, and Lance\u2019s hips go down the same time Keith\u2019s comes up, looking for that friction, and<em> boy do they get it.</em></p>\n<p>Lance lets out a whimper against Keith\u2019s neck, and then he\u2019s kissing Keith again, and everything feels hot and good, really good, but then Lance blinks and it\u2019s gone, Keith\u2019s hand on Lance\u2019s chest, pushing him softly away.</p>\n<p>Lance swallows, catching his breath, nerves floating around uncomfortably in his stomach. This is bad. This is very very very very bad. Not the kissing part, that was great, but the Keith pushing him away part.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Lance starts, but that\u2019s all he manages to get out, staring at Keith, searching for anything that will tell him how bad he\u2019s screwed up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should probably go,\u201d Keith says, like it\u2019s a question, and Lance wants to say please don\u2019t go but instead he says\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Yeah. It\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance leans back, away from Keith, giving him room to get up and leave. Lance doesn\u2019t want him to leave! Lance wants to go back to doing what they were doing only, like, a minute ago!</p>\n<p>He tries to tell Keith he doesn\u2019t have to go but all that comes out is, \u201cWe\u2019re still meeting up tomorrow, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Keith says, standing up. \u201cYeah. Tomorrow. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>The walk to the door is short, but Lance is pretty sure it\u2019s the longest walk he\u2019s ever been on. This is his chance to tell Keith, they just made out on a goddamn couch for christ sake, but Lance\u2019s gut wrenches and he can\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Lance says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d Keith says back, and then he\u2019s gone, leaving Lance\u2019s heart in his stomach. He misses the warmth, misses Keith\u2019s skin against his, misses the tiny noises Keith made.</p>\n<p>He just spent five minutes dry humping Keith on his couch and he might never get to do it again. He might never get to kiss him again. <em> He might\u2019ve just ruined their friendship.</em></p>\n<p>He hears the door knob turn, and his heart stops, expecting it to be Keith, but instead Hunk walks inside. He can\u2019t hide the disappointment from his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey man, did something happen with Keith? I saw him when I was walking up the stairs and he looked really sa\u2014dude, are you okay? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI might\u2019ve ruined everything,\u201d Lance says, voice weak.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true,\u201d Hunk reassures, placing a hand on Lance\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeith kissed me, and it was amazing. Hunk, <em> it was amazing</em>. And then we were making out and everything is going great and then he pushes me away and says he should go and he kind of looked like he didn\u2019t want to go but I\u2019m pretty sure I was just imagining that and I really don\u2019t want to lose him, Hunk,\u201d Lance rambles, anxious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said he kissed you?\u201d Lance nods. \u201cThen he must like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk to him, Lance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance lets out a breath. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the meantime, do you want to eat ice cream and watch Star Trek?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance smiles. It\u2019s small and barely there, but it\u2019s still a smile. \u201cOnly if we can cuddle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk grins. \u201cOf course, man. Always.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance can feel the unspoken words between them like a lump in his throat. Neither of them has said a thing for the thirty minutes they\u2019ve been here, their greeting consisting of unsure waves. To make matters worse, Keith hadn\u2019t sent Lance his usual morning gym selfie. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, it shouldn\u2019t make Lance\u2019s heart drop like it does, but Keith sends one every morning and if he\u2019s stopping now, what else will stop because of the kiss?</p>\n<p>They need to talk about it. Lance knows they need to talk about it, but every time he tries to start a sentence the words get caught in his throat like something\u2019s blocking them. His fear, his worry, his insecurity. They shove the words down, make the silence between them thicker.</p>\n<p>They only have an hour together on mondays, and the minutes keep ticking by, the silence dragging on, the words remaining unsaid. Lance needs to say something, but what is he supposed to say? He doesn\u2019t want to ruin what they have, the routines they fell into, they way they easily fit into one another\u2019s lives. But if he doesn\u2019t say anything, it might just ruin itself.</p>\n<p>The words are on the tip of his tongue, so close to coming out, worry swirling in his stomach, heart pounding. <em> Take a risk, Lance. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Lance blurts, and he kind of feels like he\u2019s going to throw up, but now the words are out there, now they don\u2019t have to sit in the thickness of their silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance is staring at the table, so he can\u2019t see Keith\u2019s expression, but he thinks he hears unsureness in Keith\u2019s words, like he didn\u2019t quite hear Lance right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Lance says again, and this time he looks at Keith, who\u2019s looking back at him, eyes conflicted and searching. \u201cI think I\u2019ve liked you ever since your only response to my embarrassing gym selfie was \u2018lol\u2019. And then we became friends, and I didn\u2019t want to like you, because I didn\u2019t what to ruin what we had, because I really like being your friend, so I tried to ignore my feelings but I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t make them go away and then you kissed me, and I thought, I thought for a second\u2014but then you pushed me away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance stops to take a breath, and Keith is looking at him so intently that Lance can\u2019t decide if it makes him want to shrink away or pull him closer. He opens his mouth to keep talking, to tell Keith that he wants them to still be friends, that he\u2019ll get over his feelings, but he doesn\u2019t get anything out because Keith gets there first, with words that send Lance\u2019s heart to the moon.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you, too,\u201d Keith says like his life depends on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d Lance starts to ask, but Keith knows where he\u2019s going.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause\u2014because I thought you didn\u2019t like me. I thought you knew that I liked you and you weren\u2019t saying anything because you didn\u2019t feel the same and you didn\u2019t want to hurt me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s mouth falls open in disbelief. Keith likes him. \u201cYou like me,\u201d he says, trying to process this new information, a warm giddy feeling rising in his chest as he does. \u201cYou like me,\u201d he repeats, a\u00a0smile taking over his face. \u201c<em>You like me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith is staring at him, his smile uncertain. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSince before you sent me the gym picture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d He splutters.</p>\n<p>Keith\u2019s smile grows, and Lance\u2019s heart comes back from the moon for the solid purpose of beating excessively in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You fucking like me, </em>\u201d Lance says yet again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve established th\u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m gonna take you out. I mean, <em> can I take you out</em>?\u201d Lance looks at Keith, a hopeful gleam in his eyes. \u201cKeith, buddy, pal, do you wanna go on a date with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith laughs, and it\u2019s happy and beautiful and Lance has to resist the urge to pull him in and kiss him right then and there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Keith says, nodding, smiling. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll go on a date with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI left my jacket on purpose,\u201d Keith gets out between kisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lance breaths, Keith\u2019s hands in his hair, Keith\u2019s lips moving down to his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the library,\u201d Keith clarifies, breath hot against Lance\u2019s neck. He leaves a hickey. \u201cI left it on purpose. I wanted you to wear it.\u201d He\u00a0leaves another hickey.</p>\n<p>With Keith\u2019s lips sucking at the skin on his neck, it takes a moment for Lance to process what he\u2019s said, but then it registers and he\u2019s smiling like an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he exhales, finding Keith\u2019s lips again, smiling against them. \u201cYou should take mine. When you leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith pulls away for a moment, forehead dropping against Lance\u2019s. \u201cYeah?\u201d He asks, expression soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lance says, expression just as soft, and then they\u2019re kissing again, Lance\u2019s heart floating happily away.</p>\n<p>This was never a crush he was meant to get over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Shiro starts the next day while Lance is at work. \u201cYour neck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance furrows his eyebrows in confusion. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro looks slightly uncomfortable, but then he kind of just <em> shrugs </em> and says, \u201cYou have hickeys on your neck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance clasps a hand over his neck, heat rising in his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna, um,\u201d Lance swallows, nervous laughing. \u201cI\u2019m going to go cover these up. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he squeaks, practically running from Shiro.</p>\n<p>He doesn't actually have anything to cover them up with, but he needed to get out of there.</p>\n<p>Despite his current situation, Lance finds himself smiling when he looks at his neck in the mirror. <em> Keith did that</em>.</p>\n<p>He pulls his phone from his pocket and opens snapchat.</p>\n<p><b>lance</b> <em>to Pretty Boy</em><br>\n<em>(Lance stands in front of mirror, holding up head so neck is exposed, a drawn on red circle around his hickeys)</em><br>\n&gt;thanks 4 these ur brother saw them</p>\n<p><b>Pretty Boy</b><br>\n(Keith with his lips pressed together, the corners of his lips just barely pulled up in a smile)<br>\n&gt;lol</p>"
