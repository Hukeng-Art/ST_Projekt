  "text": "<p>Last year, for Jungkook\u2019s eighteenth birthday, his dad bought him a busted up 1970 Fiat 124 Spider. Got it cheap from a guy in America, spent twice the value of the car to have it brought all the way across the ocean, and then some to strip it down to its parts and rebuild it. Eight months, an equivalent amount of his allowance, endless DIY videos and a shiny red paint job later, he\u2019d finally fixed it up good as new. Better than new, if he\u2019s being honest. So, when he says his car is his actual child, he means it.</p>\n<p>The point is, he\u2019s five hundred <em>thousand</em> percent sure he didn\u2019t go through all of that time and effort just for his car to end up being a glorified taxi for his two drunk best friends.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he's bitter. But honestly, he's allowed to be. Because Jungkook is somehow too young to attend whatever college parties Taehyung and Jimin are going to all the time, but apparently not too young to chaperone their drunk asses across the city for fast food. So that\u2019s why he\u2019s here, staring at the backlit McDonald\u2019s Drive Thru menu that\u2019s bright enough to sear into his corneas, wondering what the difference between the Double Cheeseburger and the McDouble is because <em>the pictures both look the fucking same</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to McDonald\u2019s,\u201d a deep, monotone voice that just screams everything <em>but</em> welcome drones over the Drive Thru speakers. \u201cWhat would you like today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh,\u201d Taehyung slurs, leaning dangerously out the side of the car to get his face as close to the speaker as physically possible, \u201ccan I get, uh, a Mc- McFuckin\u2019\u2026 ah, fuck it, I want the biggest McBurger you guys have, whatever the fuck it\u2019s called.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne big Mc-fuckin\u2019-burger, for the presumably drunk guy in the back,\u201d the voice says, devoid of any amusement or happiness or any indication that its owner enjoys life at all. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want the egg,\u201d Jimin says, gesturing vaguely at the menu from the passenger seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Egg McMuffin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo-o, just an egg,\u201d Jimin says slowly, giggling a little. \u201cI\u2019m on a <em>diet</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There's a long pause. \u201cYou\u2019re at the wrong McDonald\u2019s then,\u201d the voice says. Jungkook is pretty sure he can practically <em>hear</em> all faith in humanity disappearing out of the voice\u2019s owner with each word. There\u2019s a pain in it he can kind of relate to, though. Like they could be kindred spirits, maybe. \u201cIs there anyone in this car who\u2019s sober or am I going to have to call the cops?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sorry. I\u2019m the driver,\u201d Jungkook says. He covers Jimin\u2019s mouth when he leans in to say something and gently pushes him back into the seat. \u201cSorry. My friends are\u2026 yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the voice parrots, clearly unimpressed by the apology. Jungkook winces, but the voice\u2019s tone softens as it continues on, \u201cYou want anything too, Designated Driver-ssi? Unfortunately, we\u2019ve just eighty-sixed the eggs as of this conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs a little, then hopes that was an especially sarcastic attempt at humor instead of the voice\u2019s obvious hatred of life bleeding through. \u201cJust\u2026 give them a cheeseburger and the healthiest salad you have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d There\u2019s a pause, and Jungkook watches the orders pop up on the screen, makes note of the total. The voice is almost kind as it asks, \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want anything? Sounds like you need to treat yourself tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m\u2026 on a diet too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d He doesn\u2019t press. Either because he doesn\u2019t care if Jungkook is feeding himself or not, or he\u2019s decided to stop judging Jungkook's life choices.</p>\n<p>Probably the former.</p>\n<p>Which is fine, of course, because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s ever going to put himself through this again. Somewhere in the last five minutes, though, Jungkook has started to warm up to the faceless voice. Maybe, probably, he\u2019s started to find comfort in this voice that seems to be suffering just as much as he is tonight. And maybe there\u2019s a part of Jungkook that\u2019s starting to wonder just what kind of person is behind those speakers, because maybe \u2013 just <em>maybe</em> \u2013 there\u2019s something kind of nice starting to peek through the gruff, annoyed cracks of this stranger.</p>\n<p>Disappointingly, the voice is back to being curt and professional when it starts again. \u201cYour total\u2019s on screen. Please pay at the window.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, thanks,\u201d Jungkook says, shifting back into drive, feeling more awkward than ever now that the moment\u2019s over. \u201cUm, sorry again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The speakers prickle with static, like someone\u2019s sighing into it. \u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201d</p>\n<p>Right. It\u2019s not like the guy was giving Jungkook special treatment or anything. This is probably a normal night shift for him. \u201cWell, thanks for not calling the cops?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, kid,\u201d is all he gets in reply.</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls up at the window and pays, then forks out extra cash to the disgruntled-looking lady behind the window \u2013 \u201cA tip for the speaker guy,\u201d he explains \u2013 as an afterthought, which only works to make her look even more disgruntled. Jungkook really hopes she gives it to the speaker guy instead of turning around and pocketing it for herself, and spends the rest of the drive fighting the urge to turn the car around and drive back to check.</p>\n<p>Jimin and Taehyung end up finishing their food before they reach home. The trip goes by without any messes, which is more for Jimin and Taehyung\u2019s benefit than it is for Jungkook\u2019s, because best friends or not, he\u2019d flay them alive without a second thought if they puked in his car. A single piece of lettuce does fall somewhere between Jimin\u2019s seat and the door, at which point Jimin begins to cry in some combination of drunkenness and that moodiness he always seems to go through when he diets, but overall, Jungkook considers the trip a success.</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s home, he goes to throw the remaining trash away. There\u2019s still a weight in the bag; when he reaches in, he feels something round and solid at the bottom, padded by an excessive amount of napkins, that upon further investigation reveals itself to be an egg.</p>\n<p>An <em>egg</em>. An actual egg, from the McDonald\u2019s Drive Thru.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s marker on the shell that\u2019s slightly smudged, and he realizes a moment later that it spells something. As he turns it over in his hand he reads, <em>For your diet. Treat yourself next time</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so surreal, he laughs and swears never to go to that McDonald\u2019s again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three days later, and Jungkook inexplicably finds himself staring at the Drive Thru menu.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you again,\u201d <em>that</em> voice says, still filtered but just as deep and monotone as before. Now that Jungkook doesn\u2019t have Taehyung and Jimin to distract him, he\u2019s suddenly struck by how smooth and rumbling it really is.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour car. Really stands out among the regular McDonald's crowd. Might have to kill you for it some time,\u201d the voice answers, with absolutely no variation in pitch. \u201cThought you were on a diet, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s head whips around so fast he\u2019s pretty sure he hears his neck crack. \u201cWhat? You can see me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a camera,\u201d the voice says drily. There\u2019s a hint of a smile in it now too, but it might just be the horrible audio quality. \u201cBehind you. Say hi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sticks his head out the window, straining to see what the man is talking about. All he sees are confused and possibly annoyed looks from the drivers queued up behind him. He ducks back into his car sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that introductions are out of the way, can I take your order?\u201d</p>\n<p>Right, that\u2019s what Jungkook is here for. To make an order. Not to make friends with the guy behind the speakers. \u201cI\u2019d like, uh, a southwest grilled chicken salad, I guess,\u201d he says, quickly reading off the board in front of him for something that he might be able to digest. \u201cThe strawberry shake sounds good too, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize the shake defeats the purpose of ordering a salad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be taking my order?\u201d Jungkook shoots back.</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d the voice says. \u201cBut just putting this out there: if you <em>have</em> to poison yourself, the McFlurry is way better than strawberry. You can\u2019t just go to McDonald\u2019s and order any plain shake. That\u2019s like going to Wendy\u2019s and ordering a Frosty without any fries to dip with. You just don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026People dip fries in their shakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Static bursts through the speakers, and Jungkook realizes the guy is laughing. <em>Even his laugh sounds nice</em>. \u201cYou\u2019ve never done that? It\u2019s better than it sounds. You should try it. Wendy\u2019s is right across the street; you can thank me when you have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this against company policy or something? This is like, corporate sabotage. I could report you to your superiors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Me?\u201d the voice says, suddenly all sweet and faux innocence. \u201cI would never suggest Wendy\u2019s \u2013 which has fresh, never frozen meat \u2013 is better than McDonald\u2019s. Why would I do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook opens his mouth to say something, but doesn\u2019t manage to get a word out when behind him someone honks impatiently. \u201cOkay, <em>god</em>, I\u2019ll get a McFlurry if you insist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOreo or M&amp;M?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprise me,\u201d Jungkook says flatly, not ready to admit he has no idea what a McFlurry even is as he double-checks the oversized menu.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, one salad and one McFlurry, coming right up. Please proceed to the next window.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo eggs this time!\u201d Jungkook calls out in afterthought. He hears the voice laughing behind him as he drives up.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get an egg, but he does get handed two oversized shakes right after he puts down his salad. When he fishes out the receipt to double check, it shows he\u2019s been billed for both \u2013 Oreo and M&amp;M \u2013 for the price of one.</p>\n<p>He supposes this is what Speaker Guy means by <em>treat yourself</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung gives him a weird look when Jungkook mentions he\u2019s going out to get McDonald\u2019s and asks if he wants anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that code for \u2018going to see my drug dealer\u2019 or something?\u201d Taehyung says dubiously, fixing Jungkook with a look. \u201cYou <em>never</em> eat junk food.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not entirely wrong, but Jungkook is not about to tell Taehyung why he\u2019s actually going. Or that he\u2019s already gone once, because Taehyung would tell Jimin and then both of them would be jumping on him over it when it\u2019s not a big deal. At all.</p>\n<p>He crosses his arms. \u201cI can treat myself every once in a while, can\u2019t I? Do you want something or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, your definition of \u2018treating yourself\u2019 is another set at the gym.\u201d Taehyung narrows his eyes at Jungkook and looks over him appraisingly. After a moment, he finally answers, \u201cI want twenty chicken nuggets. No wait, forty. And don't even think about stealing any \u2013 I'll know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wouldn't be stealing if I bought it with my <em>own money</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Taehyung huffs, pulling out his wallet and fishing two 10,000 won bills out delicately between his fingers. \u201cHere you go. Buy yourself something too. Now you can\u2019t say hyung never did anything for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook rolls his eyes and takes the bills, all too aware of Taehyung\u2019s keen gaze following him as he leaves. If he notices Jungkook is more eager than usual to go out, he doesn\u2019t comment on it, at least.</p>\n<p>Hearing the voice is a refreshing change of pace in comparison. \u201c<em>Forty</em>? What, is this how you're finally planning on kicking the bucket? Choking to death on forty chicken nuggets?\u201d</p>\n<p>Or maybe not.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's for my friend,\u201d Jungkook explains.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhuh. Whatever helps you sleep at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really. Is it part of the employee handbook to judge your customers\u2019 life choices?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI judge everyone,\u201d the voice says without skipping a beat. \u201cEspecially the weirdo kid who won\u2019t leave me alone and tipped me at the Drive Thru. At McDonald's. I mean, who the fuck does that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could at least say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thanks for the tip. Whatever. I forgot to mention last time. You didn\u2019t have to; I get paid somewhere above minimum wage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you would get it or not,\u201d Jungkook admits. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to give me a free McFlurry either, so I guess we\u2019re even.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFree?\u201d the voice says in mock confusion. \u201cIf I remember correctly, I charged you for both. I might have made an honest mistake because I'm just <em>so</em> bad at math, but I'm not giving out drinks for free.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for being bad at math, then.\u201d Jungkook laughs.</p>\n<p>As the conversation pauses, he looks around him. There\u2019s no one in line behind him tonight to yell at him for holding up the Drive Thru queue, so he rests his arm out the car and leans in a little closer to the speakers. There\u2019s something kind of sad and desperate about him seeking out these fleeting conversations with the prickly, sarcastic stranger behind the speakers, and even sadder about the fact that Jungkook inexplicably feels his day brightening as he hears the sound of the voice, but somehow he can\u2019t seem to stop himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, I tried out a french fry Frosty, like you suggested. Way better than I expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause, then surprised laughter. \u201cI didn't think you would. So you came back just to tell me you consorted with the enemy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who told me how great Wendy\u2019s is in the first place. Is that what they teach you to tell customers during training?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said nothing like that, and you can\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins. He's about to reply when another voice gets picked up by the speakers, but it's too muffled to make out what it's saying. A moment later, the voice says, \u201cThey're starting to question why the fuck some random kid in his grandparents\u2019 fancy car has just been parked in front of the speakers talking to me, so you better pay up before I have to kick you out for holding up the line.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is that <em>my</em> fault? And why do I have to move? There isn't even a line. I'm the only person here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't make the rules. I just work here. Next window, please, before you get me fired,\u201d the voice says sweetly, right before the speakers cut.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait! What the fuck, I haven't even finished ordering yet!\u201d Jungkook yells back. No response. \u201cHey, are you ignoring me? Who's the manager here? If you don't come back and finish my order I'm going to march in there and demand to speak to your manager!\u201d</p>\n<p>Still no response. He catches a movement out the corner of his eye, and glances over to see the screen has started to fill with an order. Forty-piece chicken nuggets. A grilled chicken salad, an Oreo McFlurry, and an extra-large side of fries. The only thing missing now is the egg.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It becomes oddly routine after that. Like some compulsion he can\u2019t ignore, he soon finds himself at the Drive Thru just about every other day, at which point he doesn't know if he's in it for the easy food or the surprisingly good, if overly sarcastic company.</p>\n<p>Both are equally bleak options.</p>\n<p>He wants to think his nightly visits break up the monotony of what has to be a thankless shift. That the pain he first felt in the voice during that first night sparked some kind of sympathy deep within him, some basic human instinct to help. It's like doing a good deed for the community, making it a little brighter in his own way. Even if \u201cthe community\u201d is actually just the one guy behind the speakers.</p>\n<p>Honestly though, if someone actually asked him <em>why</em>, he wouldn't be able to answer. But that doesn't stop him from going. Which is how his daily life starts getting peppered with enriching conversations like this:</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're still here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI work here, smartass. Now are you going to order or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or:</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of branching out a little. I only ever get salads,\u201d Jungkook says, eyeing the menu. It\u2019s still a bit overwhelming how many choices there are. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever get used to it. \u201cWhat would you recommend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonally? I like Wendy\u2019s chicken nuggets. There\u2019s also a really good fried chicken place down the street; the owner there is nice and gives good discounts if you\u2019re handsome and call her Auntie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs. \u201cAre you really that handsome?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t you tell?\u201d the voice huffs, resulting in a burst of static through the speakers. He actually sounds miffed to be questioned by Jungkook, which is\u2026 kind of cute, in a way.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you must be very handsome, stuck behind a speaker working night shifts at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean,\u201d the voice says flatly, and Jungkook tries to stifle more laughter. \u201cHey. Turn around, punk, I\u2019ll see for myself if you\u2019ve got any right to talk to me like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grinning, he waits for the convertible roof to fold to give the camera a clear view and does what he\u2019s told, ignoring the exasperated looks he\u2019s getting from the drivers behind him. There\u2019s a pointed silence from the speakers in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re speechless, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m that handsome, right?\u201d Jungkook asks, twisting in his seat so he can pose better for the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t tell,\u201d the voice says gruffly, but Jungkook could swear it\u2019s gone shy. \u201cShitty camera.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the fried chicken place again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And also:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to being on a diet?\u201d asks the voice the nth time Jungkook finds himself staring at the Drive Thru menu.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill happening. I've just been working out more to make up for the milkshakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-<em>kay</em>,\u201d the voice says like that's the worst thing that Jungkook could have said. \u201cThey\u2019re just called shakes, by the way. If we called them milkshakes we\u2019d have to start putting actual milk in them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re actually trying to sabotage McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Jungkook says, grinning at the speakers. \u201cAre you going to defect to Wendy\u2019s? You have anything else you want to whistleblow while you\u2019re at it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to McDonald\u2019s. What would you like today?\u201d the voice says instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook's familiar with the routine now: engage in brief but friendly banter with the voice, order, pay, grab food, and go. So when they skip to steps two and three without step one, he can\u2019t bring himself to drive to the next window.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs something on your mind today? You\u2019re being awfully\u2026 normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's called working,\u201d the voice says pointedly. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a foreign concept to you, since all you seem to do with your time is bother me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou? Working?\u201d</p>\n<p>There's an annoyed grunt on the other end. \u201cI\u2019ve been <em>told</em> that at specific times of the day I occasionally haven\u2019t been doing my job efficiently enough, thanks to someone. So yes, I\u2019m working.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem pretty wound up. Are you sure that\u2019s all you\u2019re upset about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re cheating on me with the ahjumma at the fried chicken restaurant,\u201d the voice says, managing to sound petulant even through the usual shitty speakers and monotone. \u201cShe won't stop talking about the boy with the nice vintage car, and it\u2019s been ruining my appetite whenever I go. Here I thought you and I had something <em>special</em>, and it turns out you're just getting friendly with all of the fast food workers on this street.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you're special, all right,\u201d Jungkook can't resist saying, though a part of him is still slowly catching up to what he just said because that\u2019s the longest thing he\u2019s ever said to Jungkook at once. \u201c\u2026Wait. Is this your way of calling me a slut?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it, not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI only went because you recommended it, that\u2019s all. It was just one time, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really? What makes you think I should trust you to keep your word?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're special, babe. I wouldn't dare dream of cheating on you with the fried chicken auntie.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is a little farther than he meant to carry that joke, he thinks belatedly as he shudders at how strange the words sound sliding off his tongue. <em>Babe</em>. Fucking hell, he\u2019s going crazy. What the hell possessed him to say that, of all things?</p>\n<p>\u201cEugh,\u201d the voice agrees, and very kindly follows that up with a gagging noise. \u201cPlease don't do that again. It's weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, definitely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, when the voice wryly asks him, \u201cThe usual?\u201d and Jungkook finds himself moments later sporting a large Oreo McFlurry in one hand and driving with the other, he realizes he may have a legitimate problem.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>He has a <em>usual</em>.</p>\n<p>He has a usual at <em>McDonald\u2019s</em>.</p>\n<p>Fucking <em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even know the guy\u2019s <em>name</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know your name,\u201d Jungkook says the next time he inevitably pulls up to the Drive Thru. \u201cI have no idea what you look like, or how old you are. I don\u2019t even <em>like</em> fast food, but I keep coming back here just to talk to you. What is <em>wrong</em> with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI take offense to that,\u201d Nameless Voice says, but Jungkook could swear there\u2019s something smug creeping in his voice. \u201cYou say that like I\u2019m some sort of predator. It\u2019s perfectly normal to want to talk to me, Jeon Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook opens his mouth to retort, except\u2013 \u201cYou know <em>my</em> name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook rolls his eyes, as effective as that is. \u201c<em>How</em> do you know my name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s on your credit card, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re just being annoying on purpose. Are you going to tell me your name? I won\u2019t even question you about how you got your hands on my card or file a restraining order if you tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Kookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook decides not to fixate on the sudden endearing nickname or how it makes his heartbeat skip a little. Just a little. \u201cThis doesn't make you seem less like a predator, you know. How do I know you're not going to stalk me and kill me and run around the city wearing my skin on your face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don't, Kook-ah. Maybe that's the plan. Maybe this whole time I was just aiming to stalk you and find out where you live so I could kill you and drive off in your fancy car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, fine, I can accept that. Just tell me anything, please. This is so unfair,\u201d Jungkook says, painfully aware this is something like begging. But fuck it, he\u2019s really that desperate at this point. \u201cThe name of your first dog, the first car you ever owned, the street you grew up on, your mother\u2019s maiden name\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose are generic security questions,\u201d the voice says. \u201cWhy should I tell you anything if you\u2019re obviously just planning on stealing my identity? You want my KSSN while you\u2019re at it?\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook huffs. \u201cFine. How about, what color\u2019s your hair? You have any hobbies? A favorite book?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGray.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Gray? What, like <em>Fifty Shades</em>? That\u2019s pretty wild.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hair,\u201d the voice explains, sounding reluctant to even be doing so. \u201cIt\u2019s gray.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gray. The owner of the voice\u2019s hair is <em>gray</em>. What is he supposed to do with that information? \u201cHave I just been flirting with a sixty-year-old man for the past two months? Oh my god, and I even called you <em>babe</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d the voice says in a tone that suggests completely otherwise. \u201cYou got me. The jig is up. Congrats, your prize is a free McFlurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell hey, a McFlurry\u2019s a McFlurry. I guess I\u2019ll take it, ahjussi.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice makes a choked noise and sputters out, \u201c<em>Ahjussi</em>?\u201d and Jungkook laughs all the way to the next window.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it goes like that for a while. Probably longer than it should, but it\u2019s fine. Totally fine, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t have a problem. Definitely doesn't have a problem. Not until he wakes up one day tied to a chair.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. He wakes up not in the bed he went to sleep in, but sitting upright on a chair. To add to the confusion, when he tries to get up he finds out he can\u2019t move because there\u2019s some sort of wire tying him down.</p>\n<p>His first thought is <em>I\u2019ve been kidnapped</em>, except he\u2019s seated right in the middle of his own apartment, so unless whoever put him in this position is planning on robbing the place with him watching, he guesses not. His second thought is, <em>was I really that drunk last night?</em> but that train of thought leads nowhere because he definitely didn\u2019t touch any alcohol. They got rid of all of the alcohol in the apartment after Taehyung started drunk-playing his saxophone in the middle of the night and their neighbors called the cops on them.</p>\n<p>His confusion lasts as long as it takes for Jimin and Taehyung to appear in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie,\u201d Jimin says gently, \u201cwe're staging an intervention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>,\u201d is all Jungkook says.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks grave as Taehyung holds up one of Jungkook\u2019s trash cans. Taehyung tilts it to show him whatever\u2019s in it that\u2019s so incriminating that they had to tie him up, and Jungkook wants to bang his head against the floor. \u201cYou have a bunch of bags and <em>four</em> of these McDonald\u2019s cups in here. Judging from the leftovers inside of these cups, you\u2019ve been getting milkshakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShakes. Just shakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin and Taehyung exchange a look before they both say in comical unison, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook feels the back of his neck heating up under their scrutiny. \u201cThey can\u2019t call them milkshakes if they don\u2019t have\u2013 you know what, never mind. This is stupid. Untie me already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung frowns. \u201cSo. You have four of these <em>shakes</em> in here. It\u2019s been five days since garbage day. If we do the math, that means you\u2019re eighty percent cripplingly addicted to McDonald\u2019s shakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not how math works, Tae. That\u2019s not how <em>any of this</em> works. Did you really have to kidnap me for this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin steps forward. \u201cAll we\u2019re saying is, you <em>never</em> eat fast food and we\u2019re worried about the state of your arteries, not to mention your mental state.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung adds. \u201cWho knows what kind of stuff they add to their food to make it so cheap and addictive? And their shakes? It\u2019s like, liquid crack. First you have one, and then you have to have another, and next thing you know you\u2019re selling your TV just for more. Eventually it gets so bad you get evicted, and you can't even find a new place because you spent your entire deposit on your addiction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like- not like that, okay?\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI\u2019m not addicted to McFlurries or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say,\u201d Taehyung says, then turns to Jimin to whisper loudly, \u201cDon't believe him when he says he can stop at any time. That's how they get you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook groans and looks down, wishing he could bury his face in his hands so he wouldn\u2019t have to face\u2026 whatever this is. \u201cI just like talking to the guy who takes my order at the Drive Thru, all right,\u201d he says reluctantly.</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks once, then twice at the new information. He glances at Taehyung and gestures him closer before wrapping an arm around him. They both huddle together, whispering about something Jungkook can barely make out. Jungkook feels like rolling his eyes at the pointlessly dramatic display.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u201d Jimin says once the two separate. \u201cYou\u2019ve been ordering an unhealthy amount of fast food because you\u2019re in love with the guy at the Drive Thru.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not in <em>love</em> with him,\u201d Jungkook protests. \u201cI don\u2019t even know his name. How could I be in love with him if I don\u2019t know his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know his name?\u201d Jimin echoes skeptically. Jungkook can practically see him putting the pieces together in his head, and he doesn\u2019t like it. \u201cShit, have you even met the guy face-to-face? He could be like, a fifty-year-old dude. He probably preys on every cute college kid that drives through, Jungkookie, and you\u2019re the cutest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Taehyung nods sagely. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta be like, a real life catfish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCatfisher. He means catfisher,\u201d Jimin amends, covering Taehyung\u2019s mouth and looking at Jungkook meaningfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is so <em>wrong</em>\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it, though? Kookie, when he kidnaps you and your body is found in a ditch somewhere, we won\u2019t even be able to say \u2018I told you so\u2019 because you\u2019ll be <em>dead</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook wants to deny that. He does. There\u2019s nothing he would enjoy more than proving the two of them wrong. But when he tries to, he realizes he honestly has no way to counter that. Speaker Guy has always been dodgy about his personal details whenever pressed. Knows Jungkook's name but refuses to give up his own. Even Jungkook has brought the point up before. Anyone would find it suspicious.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like the conclusion is crazy, or anything. Jungkook would probably come to the same idea as Jimin and Taehyung, given the amount of information they have. But he knows with every fiber of his being that they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s just annoying that he can\u2019t prove it.</p>\n<p>\u201cEither way, this can\u2019t be healthy,\u201d Jimin goes on. \u201cAny of it. Even if this guy doesn\u2019t kill you, all of these shakes will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sighs. \u201cFine, whatever. If I agree to go less, will you let me out of this stupid chair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He makes an effort. A genuine effort, just for Taehyung and Jimin. He\u2019s not entirely sure <em>why</em> he\u2019s trying, though; they\u2019re the reason why this all happened to him in the first place. Honestly, it's perfectly within his rights to not listen to them at all, especially after they tied him to a chair just to interrogate him like some sort of criminal. But a part of him knows they have a point, and as crazy as they are sometimes, they care. So Jungkook makes an effort to follow through.</p>\n<p>It takes him all of a week before he\u2019s back at the Drive Thru.</p>\n<p>In all fairness, this is probably the longest gap between visits since\u2026 well, since he started going in the first place. So there\u2019s definite improvement there. A personal record, actually, if he doesn't count the nineteen years \u2013 give or take \u2013 before he spiraled into this hell.</p>\n<p>Besides, he thinks, it's not like they have to know. His biggest mistake was leaving the evidence around. He's learned. He\u2019s going to be smarter about it this time.</p>\n<p>A voice that is definitely not <em>his</em> voice welcomes Jungkook through the speakers. \u201cCan I take your\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere's the normal guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013order\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe\u2013\u201d Jungkook pauses, realizing belatedly that this is probably weird and all kinds of stalkerish, but it's too late to turn back because Speaker Guy <em>couldn\u2019t</em> have gotten replaced, not like this, without any warning. \u201c\u2013the guy on the speaker who usually works this shift. He\u2019s not here?\u201d</p>\n<p>There's a confused silence. Whether the new person behind the speakers is trying to figure out who Jungkook is talking about or trying to work out whether or not to call the police on him, he isn't sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you talking about Yoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 actually know his name. Or anything else about him, honestly. Just that he works here,\u201d Jungkook mumbles awkwardly, starting to get reminded uncomfortably about his conversation with Jimin and Taehyung. With each passing second his shame is starting to creep back to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he kind of gruff? Sounds like he hates life and would probably fight you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2026 sounds pretty accurate, actually. Grumpy, sarcastic guy, weirdly obsessed with Wendy's?\u201d</p>\n<p>The new guy laughs. \u201cYou must be talking about Yoongi-hyung. Why? Did you want him to take your order instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it's okay,\u201d Jungkook says, taking a moment to process the fact that he has a name now, testing the sound of it in his mind. <em>Yoongi</em>. It's fitting. It rumbles, just like Yoongi's voice. \u201cJust- just wondering if he was still here or if he defected to Wendy\u2019s already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOhh, you must be Jungkook,\u201d the guy says, but before Jungkook can figure out what <em>that</em> means, he continues, \u201cHe's taking some time off. Got hurt earlier and started bleeding all over the place. It looked pretty bad and was a pretty serious health concern for the kitchen so we made him go home. We had to practically drag him out, kicking and screaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sure. Knowing him, he\u2019s probably going to be totally fine and is just looking for a reason to take time off anyways. Though, come to think of it, he\u2019s been showing up more than usual for the past couple months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Jungkook says, unsure what the guy expects him to say to that.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe should be back soon, don\u2019t worry,\u201d the guy continues. \u201cIt\u2019s so cute that you\u2019re worried about him, though. Yoongi will really appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d is all Jungkook can say, because his mind is racing. Trying to figure out at which point, amongst the friendly bickering and sarcastic jabs, he started to <em>worry</em> about the voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Hoseok, by the way!\u201d the guy chirps sunnily. \u201cSorry I\u2019m not Yoongi, but you\u2019ll just have to put up with me for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jungkook clears his throat. \u201cHi, Hoseok. I\u2019ll have my usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok laughs at that before Jungkook catches himself, and Jungkook sputters an apology at the mistake. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says easily. He\u2019s friendly in a way that makes Jungkook smile, despite himself. He\u2019s friendly, he\u2019s bright, and his charisma radiates with more intensity than the fucking Drive Thru menu.</p>\n<p>In short, he\u2019s the exact opposite of Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, Jungkook,\u201d Hoseok says after Jungkook finishes listing out his order and starts to put his car back into drive, \u201cif you asked him out, he wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nearly accelerates into the wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBack on your diet?\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice sounds off today, but it's Yoongi\u2019s for sure this time. Jungkook is one part relieved, two parts conflicted. He isn't quite sure what it is, or if it\u2019s just because he hasn\u2019t talked to Yoongi in a little over three weeks, but something just feels different tonight and he\u2019s not sure how he feels about it yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, my friends staged an intervention. No more nightly McDonald\u2019s trips for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d He\u2019s not positive, but Yoongi sounds\u2026 disappointed. \u201cProbably for the best; you were right on track for type 2 diabetes with all those shakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you weren\u2019t waiting for it to kill me so you could take my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi laughs, and it strikes Jungkook that this is the first time he\u2019s talking to him as <em>Yoongi</em>, not as <em>the voice</em>. It feels like everything\u2019s changed, even though nothing really has, and for some crazy reason he feels <em>nervous</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh, how\u2019ve you been? I heard you got hurt,\u201d he says conversationally, suddenly and painfully unsure where he\u2019s hoping to go with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you know\u2026 workplace accident. It happens, but I'm all good now,\u201d Yoongi says, like he\u2019s trying to move on from that topic as quickly as possible. And then, more panicked: \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe other guy\u2013 Hoseok, he said his name was. He told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoseok.\u201d There\u2019s a groan. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That I should ask you out</em>, Jungkook\u2019s mind supplies immediately, followed by heat prickling his cheeks at the memory he\u2019s been trying to forget. From his tone, Yoongi seems to already suspect as much, but Jungkook really isn't ready to face the implications of it yet. \u201cJust\u2026 that you\u2019d gotten hurt and would take time off. I thought you\u2019d finally had enough of this place, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only,\u201d Yoongi says sullenly. \u201cThen I could probably stop trying to wait here every day for you to show up.\u201d A long pause. \u201cFuck. I did not mean to say that. Just pretend you didn\u2019t just hear that, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Of course. I'm just going to forget about you admitting you look forward to seeing me.\u201d Which he won't. Because he can't. Because maybe, deep down he was hoping this entire time Yoongi looked forward to talking to Jungkook as much as Jungkook looked forward to talking to him.</p>\n<p>As Yoongi put it so succinctly: <em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>Someone behind him is honking at him, but he\u2019s distracted by a thought that suddenly strikes him, too insistent to ignore. \u201cIs this why he seemed confused about the fact that you were coming to work more frequently than usual?\u201d</p>\n<p>There's another silence. It stretches on long enough Jungkook wonders if Yoongi might have just spontaneously decided to abandon his post and Jungkook altogether. \u201cI knew it,\u201d Yoongi groans finally. \u201cHoseok said something weird to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it's true?\u201d Jungkook presses on. \u201cYou've been <em>waiting</em> for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI work here. I\u2019d be in this exact spot even if you didn\u2019t show up. <em>You're</em> the one who would come here every other day like some sort of creep,\u201d Yoongi mutters. \u201cYou said it yourself: you don't even like fast food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like <em>you</em>,\u201d Jungkook almost says. But something stops him before he can. Maybe it's the realization that he's never quite said those exact words, never even imagined himself saying them. That this entire time, he's never even come close to conscious of what exactly this has all been about, even though the answer has always been right there.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take your silence to mean you don't disagree with the fact that you\u2019re a huge creep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't think I've forgotten you\u2019re the one who\u2019s probably some sixty-year-old man hiding behind the speakers. You wouldn\u2019t even tell me your name,\u201d Jungkook protests.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long, drawn-out sigh. \u201cI'm twenty-four, not sixty. Happy now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cDoes this mean I have to call you <em>hyung</em> now, Yoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, how old are\u2013\u201d Yoongi stutters to a halt. \u201cFuck. He told you my name too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. Now we\u2019re even, Yoongi-<em>yah</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPunk,\u201d Jungkook hears him say faintly. Then, louder: \u201cHyung is fine. Call me anything weird and I\u2019ll punch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be pretty hard to do through these speakers, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? Try me. I\u2019ll go out there myself if I have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins, suddenly tempted by the promise. \u201cYou just want an excuse to see my handsome face again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi says something, but Jungkook can\u2019t make out the words. The honking is back, louder this time. There might be some yelling too. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. Something I\u2019m going to regret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook has a feeling he knows the answer anyways. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an excuse, you know,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat time do you get off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi laughs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t look anything like he imagined.</p>\n<p>Like Jungkook were in a drama, it goes like this: he takes his order and settles down inside. Can't keep himself from wanting to burst out of his own skin in anticipation, glancing every minute towards the direction of the kitchen, at every movement around him wondering if maybe one of the uniformed people shuffling around is Yoongi, then down at his phone to check the time. Rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>Fast forward an hour \u2013 the longest hour of his life. The restaurant has nearly emptied, everyone is slowly filing out, and the staff around him is starting to look at him funny. And then, right at two minutes past the hour, he hears someone call out his name. When he looks up and locks eyes with the source of the voice, he <em>knows</em>. With every fiber of his being, he knows it's <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>Yoongi waves at him hesitantly, and it feels like everything happens in slow motion from there.</p>\n<p>Yoongi pulls off his hat and messy gray hair spills out into a fringe across his forehead. He runs a hand through his soft-looking hair, and smiles the most radiant smile Jungkook has ever laid eyes on. When he walks across the restaurant to Jungkook, he <em>strides</em>, all confident swagger that would make Jungkook's knees weak if he weren't sitting.</p>\n<p>When Yoongi reaches Jungkook, he pulls out the chair across from him, seats himself down, and softly says, \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Nice to finally meet you</em>, he should probably say. <em>Hi</em>, is acceptable too. Instead\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cYour skin is way too nice for someone working at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Jungkook blurts out, unable to stop himself from staring. Yoongi practically glows under the fluorescent lights, and his skin looks so smooth he wants to stroke it.</p>\n<p>Okay. Maybe he <em>is</em> the creep here.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, thanks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean- my friends kept telling me how sketchy this all was, you know? I was imagining this big greasy guy with like, acne and shit,\u201d Jungkook continues. Fuck it. It's too late to be embarrassed now. \u201cYou\u2019re- you\u2019re <em>cute</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s lip twitches. \u201cThank you?\u201d</p>\n<p>If Jungkook were to make a Venn diagram of all the traits he was imagining Yoongi to have and what traits Yoongi <em>actually</em> had, there would just be two circles trying their hardest to be as far away from each other as physically possible. From his deep, rough voice, Jungkook had been imagining someone big, tall, and definitely intimidating. Probably some sort of delinquent, judging from his occupation and dyed hair. The man in front of him is noticeably shorter and thinner than Jungkook, and the most intimidating thing about him is the dark slant of his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>If Jungkook had only one word to describe Yoongi, he'd have to say <em>beautiful. Ethereal. Heaven on legs.</em></p>\n<p>One word isn\u2019t enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't take this the wrong way,\u201d Jungkook is still saying, \u201cbut I honestly wasn't expecting much. I mean, who works night shifts at McDonald's and slaves behind the speaker if they have a face worth showing off? But shit, I don't think I would've had a chance if you did show off your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're pretty cute yourself, for someone who eats as badly as you do,\u201d Yoongi offers, his mouth curving bashfully and his ears turning darker pink by the second.</p>\n<p>Jungkook thinks he might be hallucinating the freckles dusting his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Yoongi starts, chewing at the inside of his cheek and his eyes fixed on where his fingers are tapping at the table, \u201cwhat now?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>What now?</em> Jungkook echoes in his mind. What does he even want? He doesn't know if he expects this to go anywhere yet. Up until a few weeks ago, he didn't know Yoongi\u2019s name. Just ten minutes ago he didn't even know what Yoongi looked like. Didn't know if they'd work out. Still doesn't know.</p>\n<p>For now, all he can see is the immediate future, and he supposes that's okay.</p>\n<p>Jungkook watches Yoongi's face \u2013 the flutter of his eyelashes, the delicate curve of his lips. Takes it all in and hopes for the best. \u201cI know I basically just met you and this is sudden, but\u2026 I want to hold your hand. And take you out somewhere. Oh\u2013 and show you off to my friends, for daring to doubt me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can do that.\u201d Yoongi glances down at Jungkook's hand and cautiously reaches across the table. His fingers are long and slim, but they fit nicely between Jungkook's own. \u201cWhere do you want to take me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven't thought that far yet,\u201d Jungkook admits. \u201cYou wanna go to Wendy's or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi makes a face. He glances down and shakes his head. \u201cI'm still in my work uniform. I can't be seen in enemy territory like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if,\u201d Jungkook scoffs. \u201cI know you\u2019re a traitor at heart. I'm sure you would be perfectly happy consorting with the enemy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi laughs, and Jungkook might have thought his laugh sounded nice before but shit, does he look good while laughing too.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, no fast food subterfuge on the first date. Noted,\u201d Jungkook says to cover up how much shakier he feels, how Yoongi's presence is chipping away at his nerve. \u201cHow do you feel about fried chicken? I know just the place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm sure that Auntie would like that.\u201d Yoongi smiles, then looks shyly down at where their fingers are just barely linked. \u201cI would, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Taehyung gasps. His jaw nearly reaches the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re really him? Jungkook didn\u2019t just hire some dude to act as Creepy Speaker Guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe name\u2019s Yoongi,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cYes, it's really me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo <em>way</em>. You're supposed to be all gross and predator-y so I could laugh at Jungkook for being catfished by some greasy old guy,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cNot- not\u2026 <em>this</em>. You're not supposed to be <em>cute</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I see why you\u2019re friends,\u201d Yoongi says drily to Jungkook, who can only shrug back and hope Jimin and Taehyung can get over the novelty that is <em>Jungkook\u2019s Date</em> soon.</p>\n<p>A little wishful thinking never hurt anyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to say is, we\u2019re excited to finally meet you,\u201d Jimin says, elbowing Taehyung, who sulks away while muttering under his breath, \u201cWhy can\u2019t <em>I</em> find a cute date at McDonald\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 nice to meet you too,\u201d Yoongi says. Under his carefully neutral face, he looks a little like a deer caught in headlights. Jungkook wants to laugh.</p>\n<p>Jimin beams. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard\u2013\u201d He falters for a second, his face falling. \u201c\u2013uh, not a lot about you. But we\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Taehyung nods vigorously. \u201cWe are so happy you\u2019re not a serial killer.\u201d He pauses, considering that for a second with a frown. \u201cOkay, never mind, you could still be a serial killer who\u2019s just biding his time, trying to get our complete trust before you cruelly snatch our Jungkookie\u2019s life away from us. I\u2019m onto you, Yoongi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s lips curl. He shakes his head at the two of them, looking exasperated, and Jungkook takes that as their cue to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways!\u201d he exclaims, tugging at Yoongi\u2019s sleeve and gesturing at the door with his chin. \u201cWe\u2019re going out now. On a date. Where I won\u2019t be serial killed. Right, Yoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi is already backing away towards the door. He nods slowly. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to use a condom!\u201d Taehyung calls out after them.</p>\n<p>Jungkook hopes he\u2019s not as red as he feels as they close the door behind them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 yeah. My friends.\u201d he waves his hand vaguely. \u201cI hope that didn't put you off. I realized halfway through that I probably should have warned you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi hums. \u201cAre they the same friends who asked for the McBurger and an egg?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs. \u201cYep. The very same. They also kidnapped me because they thought I was addicted to McFlurries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins and reaches for Yoongi\u2019s hand, squeezing it a little once their fingers slot together, reveling a bit in the warmth between them. \u201cThat's a story for next time. You know, if there is a next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi smiles. He shifts on his feet. \u201cIf you want there to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I've made it pretty clear that I do\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t manage to finish his thought before Yoongi drags his fingers through Jungkook's hair and pulls him down to press a kiss against his lips, soft and fleeting. It\u2019s not enough but at the same time it\u2019s too much, too much for Jungkook to even comprehend anything besides the feeling of Yoongi\u2019s lips against his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Yoongi says when he pulls away. He dips his head, but Jungkook catches the beginnings of a blush on his cheeks. He\u2019s pretty sure his own face looks much, much more incriminating, and he can barely understand what Yoongi is saying much less stutter out a reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cO\u2026kay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Yoongi promises before pulling Jungkook in again.</p>"
