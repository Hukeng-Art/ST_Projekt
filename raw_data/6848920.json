  "summary": "<p>Merlin dashes fiercely at the tears that have started to trickle down his face, and waits. Because if Arthur wants to take him back to Camelot as a prisoner, to a cold cell and death in the grey morning \u2013 if that is what Arthur wants, Merlin will let him, because he can\u2019t deny Arthur anything.</p>\n<p>And Arthur takes Merlin\u2019s shoulders in a hard, almost bruising grip, and he\u2019s breathing hard, and Merlin\u2019s crying messily, because he just can\u2019t seem to stop and he\u2019s more scared than he\u2019s ever been in his life.</p>",

  "text": "<p>Arthur is sunlight, warmth. He is big and shining and golden, so golden that sometimes it's like Merlin can warm his hands just in the glow around him.</p>\n<p>Merlin loves him fiercely.</p>\n<p>Merlin is moonlight and he's always cold, especially at night. They're out on a long hunt, one night, sleeping on the ground, and Merlin shivers and shivers and shivers and tries not to toss and turn, because Arthur's so damned alert and he'll notice.</p>\n<p>Then Arthur sits suddenly, in the firelit darkness, and lunges, and pulls Merlin into his warm embrace. Merlin struggles, startled, but Arthur holds him firmly until he goes still and submits.\u00a0'That's better,'\u00a0he says softly, 'you're freezing, you idiot,'\u00a0and arranges Merlin to his satisfaction.</p>\n<p>He's so warm, so beautifully big and warm, and Merlin lets out an involuntary little sound of content, burrowing a little bit into Arthur's chest, his face pressed into Arthur's shirt and neck. Arthur gives a low laugh, the sound humming soothingly past Merlin's ear, and tightens his arms around him. 'Better?'</p>\n<p>'Yes,' Merlin whispers, already slipping off to sleep; and he could\u00a0<em>almost</em>\u00a0imagine that before the darkness rolled over him, he felt the touch of lips, softly, on his hair.</p>\n<p>Merlin is soft and gentle and not at all a fighter, and it sometimes makes Arthur want to shake him in frustration, but mostly just protect him.</p>\n<p>Arthur is hard, and strong, and trained to fight, to hunt, to protect with the sword; but Merlin is something else entirely. Merlin nurtures things and cares for them and worries about them, and Arthur is fascinated by it.</p>\n<p>Merlin likes unicorns. And flowers. And children \u2013 Arthur sees him go down on one knee next to a little lost crying toddler, and coax her into watery smiles, and then lift her up in his arms and take her home to her mother, little arms clinging trustingly around his neck. He never knew that Arthur had watched him.</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s training the next day, and he stops and turns to see where Merlin is sitting on the bench, and Merlin\u2019s long smooth neck is craned up at the sky and he\u2019s smiling vaguely. Arthur follows his eyes, and there\u2019s a small wheeling bird, high in the blue heavens, dipping and circling and swooping without apparent intent.</p>\n<p>Arthur brings his sword and puts it down; he\u2019s had enough of the practice dummy anyway. He comes and sits down, not on the bench but on the ground at Merlin\u2019s feet, and there\u2019s something oddly intimate about it. He twists his head back and up to look at Merlin, and Merlin\u2019s not looking at the bird now, but at Arthur, the little smile still dreaming at the corner of his mouth. And it feels <em>right</em>.</p>\n<p>\u2018Good training?\u2019 Merlin says softly, and he reaches out to straighten the neck of Arthur\u2019s tunic where it\u2019s bunched itself up under the mail shirt. His fingers feel cool and good against Arthur\u2019s sweaty skin.</p>\n<p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Arthur confirms, and leans back against the bench, his head level with Merlin\u2019s leg. He runs a hand through his damp hair, making it stick up in sweaty spikes; and then Merlin laughs and blows a cool stream of air onto him.</p>\n<p>\u2018Ahh,\u2019 Arthur says happily. \u2018That\u2019s good. Do it again.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes, sire,\u2019 Merlin says. \u2018Your personal fan, that\u2019s me.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It\u2019s an honour, Merlin,\u2019 Arthur says lazily.</p>\n<p>Merlin blows gently on him again, long and cool, and then says, soft and provocative, \u2018<em>Prat.\u2019</em></p>\n<p>Arthur lunges at him, and Merlin writhes away, <em>almost</em> out of reach, but Arthur\u2019s battle reflexes don\u2019t betray him and they end up wrestling all over the grass, laughing breathlessly. Inevitably, Arthur prevails, and ends up pinning Merlin to the ground, triumphantly grinning down at him. \u2018Yield,\u2019 he says firmly.</p>\n<p>Merlin stops struggling and drops his head back, still laughing. \u2018All right, I yield,\u2019 he says meekly; and as Arthur releases his arms, Merlin reaches out with an easy movement and gently brushes the hair out of Arthur\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>Arthur is day, and light, and openness, and he's really rather terrible at keeping secrets considering that he's the Prince of Camelot. Sometimes he looks into Merlin's eyes, and his blue eyes are so honest and frank and open that Merlin's heart aches with his own burden of hoarded secrets.</p>\n<p>(It is <em>those</em> times that Merlin must close himself up, tight, tight, like a locked chest in a vault, because he knows it would be so, so easy to let it all come spilling out at Arthur\u2019s feet.)</p>\n<p>Merlin is dark soothing night, and he closes himself up and keeps his secrets because he must.</p>\n<p>But one day, they're out riding in the woods, bantering, and it's so stupid, the kind of inane freakish thing that never happens: a tree branch falls, as they're riding beneath it. And it's heading straight down on top of Arthur, and Merlin reacts on instinct, feeling his eyes glow warm with released magic \u2013 knocking the branch away\u00a0from Arthur. Away from his beautiful Arthur, whom he loves more than his life and his secrets.</p>\n<p>Arthur sees. Of course Arthur sees, and when the horses have stopped rearing and quietened, he\u2019s staring at Merlin as though he\u2019s just had a bucket of cold water to the face. Merlin\u2019s shivering, thinking of taking the horse and bolting; but he can\u2019t, he can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re a sorcerer,\u2019 Arthur says, blank and obvious.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Merlin says shakily, and dashes fiercely at the tears that have started to trickle down his face, waiting. Because if Arthur wants to take him back to Camelot as a prisoner, to a cold cell and death in the grey morning \u2013 if that is what Arthur wants, Merlin will let him, because he can\u2019t deny Arthur anything.</p>\n<p>\u2018You lied to me,\u2019 Arthur says quietly, and Merlin presses his knuckles into his mouth and crushes back a dry helpless sob. He can\u2019t meet Arthur\u2019s eyes, now, too afraid of what he will see in them.</p>\n<p>\u2018Get off your horse.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s voice is fierce and hard and Merlin must obey, so he does it, climbing off clumsily and waiting with a bowed head. There is silence, and then a little thud, and Merlin glances up for a fraction of a second, and <em>Arthur\u2019s off his horse</em>. He\u2019s striding towards Merlin with a grim mouth and a tight jaw, and Merlin stiffens and braces his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u2018God, just \u2013 just stop that,\u2019 Arthur sounds sick and angry and strange. \u2018I\u2019m not going to hit you, damn you.\u2019 And he takes Merlin\u2019s shoulders in a hard, almost bruising grip, and he\u2019s breathing hard, and Merlin\u2019s crying messily, because he just can\u2019t seem to stop and he\u2019s more scared than he\u2019s ever been in his life.</p>\n<p>And then Arthur\u2019s exploding. \u2018What<em> \u2013 WHAT were you THINKING?\u2019 </em>he roars, and Merlin gulps and shakes and turns his face away; but Arthur just shouts louder. \u2018<em>LOOK at me!\u2019</em> \u2013 and Merlin has to obey, and he can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s seeing, because Arthur\u2019s face is wet and furious and his mouth is working as though he\u2019s trying to stop himself from weeping.</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re \u2013 crying,\u2019 Merlin gulps.</p>\n<p>\u2018Shut up. <em>Shut up,</em>\u2019 Arthur snarls. \u2018You lied to me. You could have died. Every day. <em>Damn you.</em>\u2019 And then he yanks Merlin roughly into something that\u2019s more like a stranglehold than an embrace, and Merlin cries and cries and cries, his knees failing him, tears and snot and wetness everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u2018Sorry. I\u2019m sorry. So sorry,\u2019 he keeps snuffling into Arthur\u2019s shirt, and Arthur\u2019s chest is heaving spasmodically and his face is pressed hard into a damp patch in Merlin\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a long while they stand there, shuddering and clinging together. Finally, Arthur hauls Merlin out of the way of the horses, to a clear place by a tree, and they collapse against it, rough bark at their backs and twigs poking everywhere and Merlin\u2019s long legs getting in the way. Merlin\u2019s shuddering and sniffling, trying to wipe his face on his sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 Arthur says hoarsely, and pins Merlin\u2019s arms down, fishing around and coming up with a big handkerchief from a pocket somewhere in his clothes. He tips Merlin\u2019s stained face up and starts to dry it off, his own face fierce and wet-eyed.</p>\n<p>\u2018You have to stop crying, you\u2019ll be sick,\u2019 Arthur says after a moment, as Merlin sobs again, and once more. \u2018Merlin.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin gulps and closes his eyes for a moment, but another sob rises up his throat and the tears are still coming, leaking down his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u2018Take a deep breath,\u2019 Arthur orders. \u2018Merlin. I want you to obey me, <em>now</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>Something about Arthur\u2019s commands makes the world steady around Merlin, and he keeps his eyes closed and breathes in, and out, and concentrates on the feeling of Arthur\u2019s tight hard grip on him. One last tiny sob \u2013 \u2018Merlin,\u2019 Arthur says warningly \u2013 and he manages to stop crying, though he\u2019s still shivering all over.</p>\n<p>\u2018That\u2019s much better,\u2019 Arthur says approvingly, and Merlin looks at him; and there\u2019s something wonderful in Arthur\u2019s face, something deep and soft and serious in the way he looks into Merlin\u2019s eyes. And Arthur dries Merlin\u2019s face with the handkerchief, gently, and holds it for Merlin to blow into, and then puts it back into his own pocket when he\u2019s done.</p>\n<p>Then they sit, and after a moment Merlin realises that Arthur is <em>rocking</em> him, slightly, back and forth and back and forth, and that gives him a little bit of courage.</p>\n<p>\u2018Are you \u2013 are you going to \u2013 to \u2013?\u2019 His voice is a tiny thread of sound, but Arthur hears; and Arthur seems to curl himself over and around Merlin as though protecting him with his body.</p>\n<p>\u2018Am I going to turn you in to my father?\u2019 he says quietly. \u2018<em>Merlin</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>And he leans down and presses his forehead against Merlin\u2019s, and speaks, slow and clear but very soft. \u2018Listen to me. You are mine, and I protect what is mine with the last drop of my blood. Do you trust me?\u2019</p>\n<p>And Merlin gives a deep shaking sigh, and presses back against Arthur\u2019s forehead, trembling. His eyes meet and hold Arthur\u2019s, and he listens to the soft soothing sounds of their mingled breathing, and whispers, \u2018Yes.\u2019</p>\n<p>Things are different after that. Sometimes it feels as though Merlin can feel Arthur under his skin, so close, so opposite in nature, but so perfect. As though the tiny seed of each of them lies in the centre of the other\u2019s very soul.</p>\n<p>Merlin uses his magic, now, in Arthur\u2019s sight; little bits here and there, the lighting of a candle, the warming of a jug of water. The first time, Arthur looks at him with a white face, and then grabs him and pushes him into a chair and lectures him for a long time about being reckless and stupid and endangering himself.</p>\n<p>\u2018Can I not do magic in front of you, then?\u2019 Merlin asks quietly, when Arthur pauses for breath; and Arthur groans and closes his eyes and runs his hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re going to turn my hair grey with worrying about you,\u2019 he says in a low voice.</p>\n<p>After a moment he reaches out and takes Merlin\u2019s shoulder in a warm grasp, giving it little shakes to punctuate his words. \u2018You can do magic when you\u2019re with me, <em>alone, with the door locked</em>. Only then. And I warn you, Merlin, if I hear or see even a hint \u2013 a <em>whisper</em> \u2013 of reckless behaviour from you, I will make you sorry \u2013 you \u2013 were \u2013 ever \u2013 born. Am I understood?\u2019</p>\n<p>His face is implacable. Merlin swallows and meets his eyes. \u2018I understand,\u2019 he says meekly, and Arthur relaxes a little. There\u2019s a long moment where they look at each other, and Arthur\u2019s hand is still warm and protective on Merlin\u2019s shoulder, and Arthur has that deep serious wonderful look again, like he\u2019s looking right inside him. And Arthur is moving closer, and his eyes are very tender and his lips are parted\u2013</p>\n<p>And the door rattles, and they leap apart. Merlin\u2019s shaking all over, and he twines his fingers together and looks pleadingly at Arthur, who\u2019s smiling rather ruefully. \u2018You look like a startled deer, Merlin,\u2019 he says, and touches Merlin\u2019s face very briefly with his hand. \u2018You\u2019d better go for now.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin quivers, and goes, peeping back at Arthur when he reaches the door. Arthur\u2019s just standing, watching him, his eyes warm and soft, and smiling a very little bit.</p>\n<p>Merlin takes a deep breath, and flees.</p>\n<p>Merlin is innocent, and gentle, and very idiotic, for all his magic.</p>\n<p>Arthur loves him. He has known it since Merlin had looked at him with tear-wet eyes in the forest, his face tipped up to be dried off. Perhaps even before that, when Merlin had slipped from his horse and waited in terror for Arthur\u2019s judgement, and Arthur had known that if Merlin were to die, Arthur might as well jump into the flames to join him. Because a life without Merlin in it was unthinkable.</p>\n<p>Arthur is honourable and chivalrous, a knight of Camelot, although perhaps not quite so innocent. Merlin must not be scared, or made to get the wrong idea; Merlin deserves more than to be Arthur\u2019s secret in the dark, to be put aside when the next visiting princess or political match arrives in Camelot.</p>\n<p>(When Arthur is King, he can change things, if Merlin wants it. He has a vague idea of marriage, or some sort of equivalent union. He\u2019s not sure what precedent there is, but there must be something, and if there\u2019s not, he\u2019ll <em>make</em> something.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps it had been the wrong time, before. Merlin had been frightened, perhaps; he had certainly been shaking, beneath Arthur\u2019s hand. Next time must be better.</p>\n<p>So Arthur plans it all very carefully. He does nothing more than smile at Merlin, and ruffle his hair, the next time he sees him, though Merlin keeps shooting him little wistful glances that make hope rise up high in Arthur\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>But when Merlin\u2019s finished his tasks (adorably clumsy and flustered, because Arthur\u2019s been watching him) and turns to leave the room, Arthur stands up and stops him with a hand on his arm. Merlin\u2019s cheeks are flushed pink and his lips are quivering; it\u2019s all Arthur can do to stop himself from kissing him then and there.</p>\n<p>But Merlin is an innocent baby, and deserves for this to be done properly. Arthur caresses his arm, a very little bit, with his thumb. \u2018Merlin,\u2019 he says, \u2018I wish to go riding in the forest tomorrow. Will you come with me?\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin looks at him with wide startled blue eyes, because Arthur, it must be admitted, has never really <em>asked</em> Merlin to accompany him anywhere, just ordered it or assumed that he would be there. Arthur holds his eyes with his own, smiling slightly, and Merlin swallows. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he whispers.</p>\n<p>They go riding, and Merlin\u2019s so jittery and jumpy that it\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t spook his horse. Arthur decides not to take them too far, because Merlin looks like he might bolt at any moment.</p>\n<p>\u2018Do you like this?\u2019 Arthur asks, and Merlin bites his lip and nods, looking rather as though Arthur has grown an extra head.</p>\n<p>They dismount, and tie up the horses \u2013 at least Arthur ties up his horse, and then looks over at Merlin, and Merlin\u2019s head is bowed over the straps and he seems to be having trouble. Arthur moves up behind him, and says \u2018Need some help?\u2019 in his ear, and Merlin jumps violently and swings around.</p>\n<p>\u2018No! I mean, no \u2013 yes!\u2019 he stutters, and then says desperately, \u2018Why are you acting like this?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Like what?\u2019 Arthur asks.</p>\n<p>\u2018Like \u2013 like you\u2019re under \u2013 some sort of spell!\u2019 Merlin blurts, and he looks upset and worried, his brow furrowed up and his fingers twisting and pulling in his own hair.</p>\n<p>Ah. Arthur begins to understand. \u2018Has that happened before?\u2019 he asks.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 Merlin says miserably, \u2018and you\u2019re acting weird and too <em>nice</em> and not insulting me or ordering me about \u2013 and \u2013 and I don\u2019t know what to think.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Not ordering you about?\u2019 Arthur says lightly. \u2018Or insulting you? Well, then. Merlin, you suspiciously minded <em>idiot</em>, I\u2019m <em>ordering</em> you to sit down here, right now, and shut up and listen while I talk some sense into your thick skull.\u2019 He waits, watching Merlin\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Merlin makes a funny little sound. It might be a sob, but it probably isn\u2019t, because he\u2019s starting to smile, joyful and relieved, and the smile spreads all the way to his eyes and his adorable ears.</p>\n<p>Arthur ties up his horse for him, shaking his head at the tangle Merlin\u2019s made of it all. Then they sit down together on the soft pine-needled patch that Arthur has chosen; and Merlin hugs his knees to his chest and smiles happily at Arthur over the top of them.</p>\n<p>\u2018Now,\u2019 Arthur says. \u2018I suppose you think I\u2019m under a love spell. I assure you that I\u2019m not. My head\u2019s clear, there are no gaps in my memories and I still think you\u2019re the worst manservant I\u2019ve ever had. I was merely trying to be nice, but it has become obvious that you\u2019re seriously disturbed and enjoy being insulted.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s face is an adorable combination of delighted and confused; he\u2019s flushing and looking down at his knees, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. Then he peeps at Arthur from under his eyelashes, and says softly, \u2018Prat!\u2019</p>\n<p>Arthur wants to reach for him, <em>so badly</em>. Perhaps Merlin isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s seriously disturbed, because Arthur thinks that he rather likes being insulted by Merlin, too. They smile at each other, and then Arthur remembers something, and jumps up, pointing a finger at Merlin. \u2018Stay there.\u2019</p>\n<p>He\u2019s back in half a minute, holding his hand behind his back. \u2018Part of the reason I chose this spot,\u2019 he says, \u2018was this.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin looks at him inquiringly, and Arthur grins and proffers the blue periwinkle he\u2019s holding in his hand. \u2018I want to give you flowers,\u2019 he says quietly.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long pause, and then Merlin \u2013 Merlin is pressing his knuckles into his mouth, hard, and blinking rapidly, and sniffing; and Arthur reaches for him.</p>\n<p>And Merlin is scrambling and coming to him as though he belongs there, nestling into Arthur\u2019s chest and flinging his arms around his neck. It\u2019s like all the other times they\u2019ve held each other, and yet different, gentler. Waves of tenderness are rolling over Arthur, and Merlin keeps sniffling, and there are tears on his face.</p>\n<p>Arthur cradles Merlin\u2019s head, and places the periwinkle at his neck, tucked in the folds of the red scarf. And then \u2013 and then, Merlin\u2019s face is close, and his lips are soft, so soft; and Arthur leans forward and kisses him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s incredible, and amazing, and worthy of a love song that Arthur has no capability at all to write. Merlin\u2019s quivering in his arms, making little contented sobbing noises, and his lips are even softer than Arthur had imagined, and trembling against Arthur\u2019s own. Arthur kisses away the doubt, and the worry, and the fear of Merlin\u2019s magic being discovered; he kisses away the ache of Merlin\u2019s long-kept secrets.</p>\n<p>And he kisses Merlin because he loves him, and he always will love him, and they belong together, like two opposite halves of a whole being. And the kiss is a promise between them.</p>\n<p>\u2018I want you to marry me,\u2019 Arthur says. They\u2019ve just broken the kiss, and Merlin\u2019s in a dizzy euphoric daze, half-lying against Arthur\u2019s chest, which is warm and comforting and blessedly solid. Arthur\u2019s arms are strong and reassuring around him, and Merlin snuggles into them, and Arthur laughs softly. \u2018You\u2019re an innocent little baby, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p>Really, that\u2019s going too far. Merlin\u2019s tongue feels heavy and slow, but he manages to murmur, \u2018I am not.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Of course you are,\u2019 Arthur says firmly. \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Is that \u2013 even possible?\u2019 Merlin asks sleepily, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u2018It will be,\u2019 Arthur says, and there\u2019s that mulish, implacable look again, the one that says that Arthur will have his sweet way, if he has to turn half the world to fire to do so. \u2018It will be, when I am King. <em>I promise you, </em>Merlin.\u2019 He pauses, and looks into Merlin\u2019s eyes. \u2018You\u2019re not going to be my secret in the dark. I\u2019m going to marry you, or nothing.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s heart feels full and light, like it\u2019s going to burst out of his chest; and he turns his face into Arthur\u2019s neck and rubs his nose softly against the skin there, smelling Arthur\u2019s nice warm safe Arthur-smell.</p>\n<p>\u2018I sometimes \u2013 sometimes wondered if, if all that honour and chivalry stuff was really true to you knights,\u2019 he says, rather unsteadily, into the hollow of Arthur\u2019s neck, and feels Arthur bend his head to listen. \u2018I guess it is. To you.\u2019</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s hand smoothes up and down his back, gentle. \u2018It is,\u2019 he says firmly.</p>\n<p>They go back to Camelot, and to anyone else\u2019s eyes go on as they always have, the Crown Prince and his manservant.</p>\n<p>Except now there are long soft glances between them, and lingering touches that they can\u2019t quite hold back when they\u2019re in public. And in Arthur\u2019s rooms, behind the barred door, there are sometimes long sweet kisses, and sometimes gentle nestling embraces that go on, and on, and on, and give both of them strength to carry on with everything, day after day.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Arthur falls into a black mood. \u2018This will drive me out of my mind,\u2019 he mumbles into Merlin\u2019s neck. \u2018This hiding. Lying.\u2019</p>\n<p>They\u2019re cuddled up in a pile of blankets by the window, watching rain drip coldly off the stone, and Arthur\u2019s expression has been tight and drawn all day. Merlin runs gentle sure fingers over his face, smoothing out the wrinkles in Arthur\u2019s forehead, running his hands through Arthur\u2019s soft hair. \u2018Shh,\u2019 he says, and pulls Arthur in closer to kiss his temple softly. \u2018Don\u2019t be a dollophead.\u2019</p>\n<p>That makes Arthur grin a little bit. \u2018That\u2019s not even a word, Merlin.\u2019 He shifts round a bit, disturbing Merlin, who\u2019s nuzzling his cheek like a baby deer, and takes Merlin\u2019s chin tenderly, and kisses him.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s Merlin who goes quiet and miserable, and it takes a lot of coaxing from Arthur before he will talk it out with him.</p>\n<p>\u2018Come on,\u2019 says Arthur gently, after a dismal morning of council meetings, where Merlin has had to stand quietly behind Arthur\u2019s chair and listen to the King outline new plans for the suppression of scattered magic users, and drop veiled hints about \u2018strategic alliances\u2019 with one eye on Arthur.</p>\n<p>\u2018Merlin.\u2019 Arthur bolts the door behind them and reaches out; Merlin\u2019s stiff and chilled and taut, like a spear of ice. \u2018Oh, come here.\u2019</p>\n<p>He wraps warm strong arms around Merlin, and for a moment Merlin stays rigid and unbending. The next, he\u2019s shuddering and melting and grabbing onto Arthur\u2019s shirt as though he wants to burrow into his chest, and Arthur holds him and makes small soothing sounds and rocks him a little to calm him.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, so sorry. It won\u2019t always be like this,\u2019 he murmurs against\u00a0Merlin\u2019s dark hair.</p>\n<p>\u2018I know,\u2019 Merlin mumbles into his shoulder, and they hold on to each other for a long quietening moment. And their lips seek each other and meet softly, and everything seems somehow brighter, though the sky is misty grey outside the window.</p>\n<p>Other times, lovely times, they sit together in the sun, and laugh and tease and talk about all the things they\u2019ll do, one day, together.</p>\n<p>Arthur finds that Merlin wants children, someday, and also that he blushes most adorably when Arthur brings the subject up. They end up wrestling on the grass over it, which inevitably leads to Arthur pinning Merlin helpless beneath his body while Merlin fires breathless laughing insults at him, the both of them surrounded by a happy haze.</p>\n<p>Merlin, for his part, coaxes out Arthur\u2019s dreams of ruling with Merlin as his Consort and Court Warlock at his side, and it takes a little while for him to become accustomed to the thought of such worryingly high rank. \u2018But Arthur! I\u2019ve no idea how to act like a \u2013 a Consort or anything! And what kind of awful clothes will I have to wear?\u2019</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s eyes gleam.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh, no,\u2019 Merlin says warningly. \u2018Oh, no, you don\u2019t, you prat.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh, <em>yes</em>, I do,\u2019 Arthur says in a voice of soft velvet; and he drowns Merlin\u2019s objections in another kiss, one that leaves Merlin dizzy and happy and incoherent and quite unable to form any more protests or defy Arthur\u2019s authority in any way.</p>\n<p>And so they build their shining dream-castles in the air, for the future and the kingdom they\u2019ll make together. King and warlock, sun and moon, night and day \u2013 two halves of a whole, complete, connected, in complement.</p>\n<p>And hope is in the very air they breathe, and a promise.</p>\n<p>\u2018Look,\u2019 Merlin says softly. \u2018You can see where the clouds are going.\u2019</p>\n<p>Arthur squeezes his hand. They\u2019re lying on their backs, in the long soft meadow grass, three day\u2019s ride from Camelot; and Arthur\u2019s heart feels warm and full and light, and Merlin is by his side. And there is a ring on Arthur's hand that was not there before, and a matching pair to it on Merlin's; silver and gold twining and knotting together in complicated twists.</p>\n<p>\u2018The sky\u2019s so blue,\u2019 Arthur says, and Merlin lets out a little breath of a laugh of pure happiness, and rolls over\u00a0so he's against Arthur's chest, looking deep into Arthur's face with a smile as blinding as\u00a0summer sunshine.\u00a0Arthur bumps his nose gently to Merlin's, and he can't help grinning back at Merlin\u00a0like a lovesick fool.</p>\n<p>And\u00a0then they\u2019re melting and twining together, body fitted to body, lips moving slowly against each other; and all around them like an embrace are the soft sounds of the grass and the Earth and the trees.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Several months earlier</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes, everything just goes wrong. As though the world is conspiring against you or something, trying to knock you off your feet and drag you down. Merlin feels a bit like that, right now.</p>\n<p>The King is pushing Arthur to choose the bride of his choice from three highly eligible princesses and one just-as-eligible widowed noblewoman. He has also been enthusiastically drafting plans to hunt down certain wandering bands of druids that have been sighted in the borderlands, and he\u2019s placed Arthur in charge of their extermination.</p>\n<p>Uther holds a large and cheerful session with his council to unveil these new plans, and Merlin stands in the corner and fixes his eyes on Arthur\u2019s face, because he thinks he might scream if he looks anywhere else. So he just looks, and looks, and looks at Arthur, at Arthur\u2019s strong fierce jawline and proud beautiful nose and kind mouth, while Uther\u2019s voice fills up and reverberates around the inside of his head. And every so often Arthur glances at Merlin, and it\u2019s like a lifeline between them.</p>\n<p>Finally,\u00a0<em>finally</em>, it\u2019s blessedly over, and Merlin comes to Arthur, and they leave the hall together, and go to Arthur\u2019s room. There\u2019s no speaking between them, but they\u2019re walking so close beside each other that their shoulders are brushing.</p>\n<p>And Arthur pushes the door shut behind them, and bolts it with a fierce thud as though to shut the whole world out; and they turn and look at each other.</p>\n<p>\u2018I don\u2019t\u00a0<em>want</em>\u00a0a damned bride,\u2019 Arthur says in a crackly sort of voice. \u2018Unless it\u2019s you. You wouldn\u2019t be a bride, I suppose.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No, you \u2013\u00a0<em>you\u2019d\u00a0</em>be the bride,\u2019 Merlin says, trying to turn it into a joke, although his laugh breaks a bit at the end.</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s grin is crooked. \u2018Not a chance,\u2019 he says. And then both of them move at the same moment; and Arthur rests his palms on Merlin's shoulders, and Merlin cradles the back of Arthur\u2019s head with one hand, and tugs, so that their foreheads meet and they lean together. The sound of their breathing mingles; and Merlin\u2019s free hand comes to rest on Arthur\u2019s chest, rubbing little blunt circles over his shirt.</p>\n<p>'I -'\u00a0Merlin says, and his voice cracks a little, and he clears his throat and tries again. 'I love you.' It comes out quiet, aching, tender.</p>\n<p>Arthur's eyes are closed tightly,\u00a0and he swallows. 'Me, too,' he says.\u00a0'But <em>you,</em> that is\u00a0\u2013 I mean\u2026' He trails off, blushing a little\u00a0and tongue-tied. Merlin snorts a little, at the dear vulnerable idiocy of him, and it makes\u00a0a little weary smile tug at the corner of Arthur's lips.</p>\n<p>He tips his head to\u00a0take\u00a0Merlin's mouth with his own, and then they're melting together, lips against lips, hands warm as sunshine on each other's backs.</p>\n<p>'I just \u2013 ' Arthur says, much later,\u00a0and stops.\u00a0'I just want to go away from everything, sometimes. Just \u2013 go, somewhere, where I don't have to be\u00a0a prince, and no-one wants me to marry anyone I don't love, or hurt innocent people, or anything.\u00a0You \u2013 me \u2013 we could run away.\u00a0Somewhere far away \u2013 oh, I know it's stupid, you don't have to tell me that I have my duty to think of, but... But.' He laughs a little bit, self-deprecating.</p>\n<p>They're curled up by the window, in their favourite spot, watching the late-winter rains turn the snow to slush. Merlin snuggles against his side, playing with Arthur\u2019s shirt-laces. 'It's your father that tells you things like that, not me, Arthur. And it would be wonderful, why can't we do it?'</p>\n<p>Arthur looks at him. 'What? Merlin, you know we can't just\u00a0<em>elope</em>. What on earth are you talking about?'</p>\n<p>Merlin's eyes are very bright. It's his\u00a0<em>thinking\u00a0</em>look, the one he gets when he's having an idea. His ideas are split rather evenly between brilliant and atrocious, so Arthur fixes him with a wary eye.</p>\n<p>'Go on, spit it out.'</p>\n<p>Merlin leans forward. 'Why\u00a0<em>can't</em>\u00a0we elope? No, listen, Arthur, really. I don\u2019t mean really run away from everything, but\u2026 I've been finding out things, talking to people. The druids \u2013 they marry people like \u2013 like us. It doesn't matter if it's two men, or two women, it doesn't make any difference to them.' His voice trails, quiet. 'Anyone who wants to, to make... promises. To each other.' He holds Arthur's eyes, a flush rising high on his cheekbones.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a traitorous little stab of excitement in Arthur\u2019s chest, and he swallows hard, because there\u2019s something big and tight in his throat that feels oddly like\u00a0<em>hope</em>.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019d \u2013 I want that, Merlin,\u2019 he says hoarsely. \u2018I really \u2013 I want that, a lot. Do you \u2013 would you \u2013 with me\u2026?\u2019</p>\n<p>And Merlin\u2019s laughing rather unsteadily, and his eyes are brighter than ever, and his lashes are wet. \u2018Of\u00a0<em>course</em>\u00a0I do, you big dollophead. And you \u2013 you just had t-to make me cry, didn\u2019t you?\u2019</p>\n<p>Arthur thinks that\u2019s a little unfair, because he hadn\u2019t done anything, really; but he doesn\u2019t have time to say that, because Merlin\u2019s suddenly turning and flinging his arms fiercely around Arthur\u2019s neck, nestling and pressing against him as though he\u2019s trying to melt the both of them into one person.</p>\n<p>Arthur holds him tenderly and dear God, he\u2019s so\u00a0<em>lucky</em>, so very impossibly blessed to have Merlin, because Merlin is dear and beautiful and the most precious thing in Arthur\u2019s\u00a0<em>life</em>. And a great crashing billow of feeling surges up inside him, so that he wants to run for miles and fight and dance and bite Merlin softly all over his face, and\u00a0shout to the world that he loves him, he loves him, he loves him.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say it, of course, can\u2019t say it, because he's Arthur and sometimes it\u2019s hard to make his words match up with everything that\u2019s really inside his heart. But he looks at Merlin, and he thinks that at least some little part of it must be showing on his face, because Merlin\u2019s face is open and wondering, looking into Arthur\u2019s own as though he sees a revelation.</p>\n<p>\u2018Arthur,\u2019 Merlin whispers. \u2018Oh \u2013 Arthur \u2013\u00a0<em>Arthur</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I love you,\u2019 Arthur says awkwardly, and feels himself flushing to hear his voice finally\u00a0say the words. It sounds so \u2013 so pathetic, and ordinary-sounding, and not at all like the beautiful deep\u00a0<em>feeling\u00a0</em>of it in the core of himself. It\u2019s not like when Merlin says it, either, sweet and heartfelt, his blue eyes intense.</p>\n<p>But Merlin doesn't seem to mind, because he's coming and crushing his mouth against Arthur's, kissing him with tender trembling lips, and of course he's crying because he's\u00a0an innocent sentimental baby who\u00a0<em>always</em>\u00a0cries when he's happy or sad. And Arthur kisses him back, and then licks up his tears with tiny gentle flicks of his tongue along Merlin's cheekbones, because it seems like the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>It takes months. Months of Merlin going off on surreptitious scouting trips to make contact with travelling druid tribes, months of\u00a0Arthur staying behind and worrying, months of plans and disappointments and excuses and longing.</p>\n<p>'The druids are peaceful,' Merlin says gently. He runs his hands reassuringly up and down Arthur's back, standing behind him as Arthur broods out of the window. Merlin's fingers are long and slender, sure and skilful, and Arthur relaxes into the caress with a little weary sound as Merlin rubs gentle thumbs into the hard tensed bands of muscle in his shoulders.</p>\n<p>'Yes, the druids are peaceful,' Arthur says, his eyes closed, 'but the bandits and raiders aren't.\u00a0I want to\u00a0come with you.'</p>\n<p>Merlin sighs and leans forward against Arthur so that his firm chin rests on Arthur\u2019s shoulder, turning his head in and sort of nestling the tip of his nose into Arthur\u2019s hair, inhaling. \u2018I want you to come, too,\u2019 he admits, and his arms come around Arthur\u2019s body. \u2018But you can\u2019t, Arthur. Not every time. There\u2019s only so many times you can use the same excuses to your father. And I\u00a0<em>can</em>\u00a0take care of myself, you know.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Could have fooled me,\u2019 Arthur says darkly.</p>\n<p>Merlin leaves again, and Arthur waits \u2013 again.</p>\n<p>Merlin returns, rather bruised and battered looking, but happy. 'I found them,' he says, his voice full off suppressed exultation. 'They will \u2013 they'll marry us. Arthur.'</p>\n<p>Arthur runs his hands are all over him, wanting to touch as much as he can, sitting Merlin down in his big chair, gently brushing his hair away from a shallow crusted cut on his forehead. 'You're hurt,' he says.</p>\n<p>'Just scratches.' Merlin closes his eyes, basking in enjoyment as Arthur's fingers card through his hair. 'No bandits - well, except for that little hungry one.'</p>\n<p>'<em>Little hungry one?</em>' Arthur says. 'Merlin, what the\u00a0<em>hell</em>\u00a0are you talking about? Did he give you that cut?'</p>\n<p>Merlin sighs. 'No,' he says. 'That was a tree. He was little and scared and only about fourteen or something, so I took away his knife and gave him supper. Look Arthur,\u00a0<em>please\u00a0</em>can you not ask me lots of questions because I'm really, really tired. Just... shh, all right?'</p>\n<p>'I'm sorry,' Arthur says quietly, and puts his arm around him, perching on the table. Merlin turns his face in to Arthur\u2019s arm, just sort of hiding there and breathing in Arthur\u2019s scent, and it does strange shivery mushy things to Arthur\u2019s insides. He rubs his thumb in gentle circles over the soft sharp bump of Merlin\u2019s shoulderblade, over and over, feeling Merlin relax more and more against him.</p>\n<p>After a few moments Arthur goes and catches a passing palace servant, ordering food to be brought, and warm water in a bowl. He takes a cloth and kneels by Merlin, carefully washing his face and hands, dabbing very gently at the dried blood on his forehead, feeling Merlin\u2019s gaze on his face. When he looks up from the task to meet Merlin\u2019s eyes, there\u2019s such a look of raw naked adoration there that it makes Arthur catch his breath. It\u2019s so like Merlin \u2013 giving <em>everything</em>, not holding any tiny scrap of himself back.</p>\n<p>Arthur finishes cleaning Merlin\u2019s hands, between each slim finger, and then bends his head down and kisses each one separately. <em>I love you,</em> he thinks with each kiss. <em>I love you. I love you.</em></p>\n<p><em>Go to the Grove of Frithgeard, ten days hence, </em>the druids had said, the words slotting softly into Merlin\u2019s mind without need of spoken voice. <em>Meet us beneath the Great Oak of Trysting. Let neither you nor your plighted one, the Prince of Camelot, carry weapons into the place of peace.</em></p>\n<p><em>I \u2013 what? I never said who he was! </em>Merlin had spluttered in his mind, lurching back a little, wary.</p>\n<p>A warm chuckle filled his head. The druid chieftain was smiling, but gently. <em>You do not have to, Emrys, for he fills your mind like golden sunlight. Even you cannot hide it. But you do not have to fear us, for we bear no ill will toward the Prince, who will bring peace and kindness and magic back to the land when he is King. We are honoured to help him, as we are honoured to help you.</em></p>\n<p>And Merlin couldn\u2019t help blushing and smiling a little, and when he looked up the chieftain had an oddly soft, fond look on his face. <em>You are\u2026 not quite what we expected, Emrys, when we heard the old tales. You are both younger and more wise, and love shapes all that you do, which is the greatest wisdom of all. You are like us, Emrys, and we are glad to meet you in a moment of peace and happiness.</em></p>\n<p><em>My name is Merlin, </em>Merlin thought, impulsively.</p>\n<p>A warmth swept through his mind, the warmth of many smiles. <em>We thank you, Merlin. To us you will always be Emrys, but it brings us happiness to be given your other name.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you. </em>Merlin had bowed his head and spread his hands in the druid\u2019s own gesture of peace and goodwill. <em>Thank you.</em></p>\n<p>Merlin and Arthur wait alone in the Grove from the early morning. Sunlight dapples down through the branches of the Great Oak, making patterns on the grass beneath it where they lie.</p>\n<p>They had been woken when the dawn had just begun to streak across the night sky; woken with gentle hands and led to a sacred spring, stripped and bathed side by side in chilled water that made them gasp, and then dried with unbleached woven cloths.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re dressed, now, in soft white shirts, open-necked and comfortable; weaponless. \u2018Wait here together,\u2019 the robed attendants had murmured, smiling a little. \u2018You will not be disturbed, the next few hours. When the day reaches its climax and the sun its zenith, the tribe will come, and Iseldir our chief will bind you together beneath the living sun.\u2019 Then they had dipped their heads and left.</p>\n<p>\u2018This is\u2026 good,\u2019 Arthur says quietly. \u2018I \u2013 thought it would be strange. Druids. My father talks about them as though they\u2019re evil incarnate, and he \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know anything about them.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin nestles his head into the crook of Arthur\u2019s neck, taking his hand in his own and playing with it, fitting their fingers together. \u2018Arthur, you are <em>not your father</em>. They\u2019re honoured to do this for you, you know. They said so. Because you\u2019ll bring peace and magic and \u2013 kindness back to Camelot.\u2019 He rubs his thumb, softly, over the back of Arthur\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u2018They remind me of you, you know,\u2019 Arthur murmurs. His hand wanders to Merlin\u2019s collarbone, tracing gentle swirling patterns across his skin and making him shiver. \u2018Kind. Wise. Gentle.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin swallows and tries to grin. \u2018You\u2019re very \u2013 complimentary \u2013 today.\u2019</p>\n<p>And then Arthur\u2019s everywhere, his mouth suckling warm kisses into Merlin\u2019s neck, his hands threading through his hair. \u2018It is \u2013 my wedding day \u2013 after all, Merlin. And they said we wouldn\u2019t be disturbed.\u2019</p>\n<p>Merlin laughs, rather breathlessly, because it\u2019s hard to think straight with Arthur\u2019s lips just <em>there</em> \u2013 and <em>there</em>. And then Arthur\u2019s fingers dip beneath his shirt \u2013 and he \u2013 dear God, he <em>bites,</em> softly, and, oh\u2026 Merlin stops thinking at all.</p>\n<p>The ritual is almost silent. Merlin and Arthur stand beneath the oak, hands clasped together, the druid tribe forming a quiet half-circle around them.</p>\n<p>A small girl appears, a small smiley brown-eyed girl, and the people part to make way for her. She\u2019s only about five years old, and she\u2019s carefully bearing two circlets of leafy green.</p>\n<p>Iseldir is standing a little to one side; he smiles encouragingly at the child, and murmurs to Merlin and Arthur, \u2018Kneel now, so Frytha can crown you.\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s gentle, familiar, friendly; the gathered people smile lovingly as Iseldir guides the little Frytha through her part in the ritual. She places a garland on Merlin\u2019s head, and one on Arthur\u2019s shining hair, beaming proudly at them. Merlin can\u2019t help smiling back at her, and when he glances at Arthur, he sees that Arthur has a soft look on his face that makes Merlin want to kiss him right then and there.</p>\n<p>Frytha kisses them both heartily on their cheeks, flinging her little arms around each of their necks in turn and squeezing affectionately. \u2018May the Earth bless your handfasting,\u2019 she says carefully, a line learned by heart; and then makes a wobbly little druid peace-sign with her hands and scurries away with a flurry of brown curls.</p>\n<p>Iseldir comes forward, a wooden cup held in his hands. He offers it first to Arthur, who\u2019s closest; Merlin sees that it\u2019s full of deep red wine. Arthur drinks deep and long, meeting Merlin\u2019s eyes gravely across the rim of the cup. Merlin smiles a little; and then Iseldir is offering him the cup, and Merlin fits his lips over the place where Arthur had drunk.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a murmured sound of approval from the druids around them, but Merlin doesn\u2019t look away from Arthur\u2019s blue, blue eyes, endless as the sky. Iseldir takes the cup back when Merlin has drunk, and sets it down, coming to stand beside them again.</p>\n<p>\u2018Take each other\u2019s hands,\u2019 he says softly.</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s hands are warm and steady and comfortingly familiar. Merlin squeezes them a little, meeting Arthur\u2019s answering smile with a quirk of his own lips.</p>\n<p>A long trailing wreath is wrapped round their hands. \u2018Beneath the Sun I bind you together,\u2019 Iseldir chants quietly, and the voices of the clan mingle together with his. \u2018Let the Earth around us bear witness.\u2019</p>\n<p>This is their cue, as they had been instructed beforehand, and Merlin says softly, \u2018Let it be so indeed.\u2019 Arthur repeats it after him, his voice husky.</p>\n<p>\u2018Frytha,\u2019 Iseldir murmurs, and the little girl is there again, tongue stuck out the corner of her mouth in concentration as she carefully takes away the wreath. Then Iseldir gives something into each of her small hands, and she comes forward again, brown eyes wide and intent.</p>\n<p>\u2018By the Sun, and the Moon and the Earth awound us,\u2019 she says lispingly, and then beams in triumph at having said her line correctly, offering them her outstretched hands. A ring rests in the careful cup of each small palm, gold and silver twisted and twined together.</p>\n<p>They fumble a little, together, as they exchange the rings; Merlin gives a tiny huff of warm laughter at Arthur\u2019s unsteady hands, and Arthur glances up, meeting his eyes with soft amusement for a moment. But then the bands slip onto their fingers, cool and fitting and <em>right</em>.</p>\n<p>Then Arthur\u2019s arms are around Merlin, and Merlin\u2019s hands are clutching Arthur\u2019s back, bodies melding against each other. And they kiss each other\u2019s lips, there beneath the Great Oak with the sound of the Earth all around about them, and the soft glad murmurs of the watching tribe.</p>\n<p>Arthur curls himself more closely around Merlin, resting his face in Merlin\u2019s soft dark hair. They\u2019re nestled together, blissfully spent from making love over and over again, close to sleep. The full moon is white and softly glimmering above them where they lie; their cloaks make a scant barrier beneath them, but the grass is soft.</p>\n<p>\u2018Do you ever feel so happy that you could just \u2013 burst?\u2019 Merlin murmurs.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s soft and pliant and dreamy, and he turns his head languidly against Arthur\u2019s shoulder. Arthur can see him in the clear wash of moonlight \u2013 the dear familiar line of Merlin\u2019s cheekbone and jaw, the light catching in his eyes, the soft question of his lips. And Arthur\u2019s heart is full, so very full, and it feels like liquid shining happiness is filling him up all the way through to the core of his being.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Arthur says into Merlin\u2019s hair, and drops a kiss there, very, very gently.</p>"
