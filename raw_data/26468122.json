He's still not sure if he wants to be saved, but there are two Pro Heroes in the making that might have something to say about that!</p>\n<p>TW: Izuku has a nightmare, lots of self-hate in this chapter :(</p>\n<p>Izuku finally tells them! TW for lots of talk about death &amp; references to attempted suicide in this chapter.</p>\n<p>3.1k words of gratuitous hizashi &amp; izuku friendship fluff</p>\n<p>Izuku learns to kick some ass!</p>\n<p>Izuku tells them everything.</p>\n<p>Izuku goes to a festival!</p>\n<p>Izuku's time is up.</p>\n<p>The end!</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Hi everyone! This is my very first BNHA fic, so I hope you enjoy. Just a quick note, the story has heavy themes of suicide, depression, abuse, self-esteem issues, etc - so if that bothers you, please, don't feel like you have to read.</p>\n<p>Also, this is a time travel fic set in a universe where Izuku doesn't receive OFA! Instead he gets thrown into the past and meets Teen!Aizawa and Teen!Hizashi.</p>\n<p>Title of the fic is from the song \"Everglow\" by Starset - highly recommend it!!! I feel like it suits the fic very well.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hope you guys like the fic so far! This was originally intended to be a fic with just Aizawa &amp; Izuku, but it fit so much better with Hizashi that I couldn't help but include him. Now they're both gonna be a part of Izuku's stay, and I think it works. Hope you guys agree! Also, the funky timeline will be addressed and explained in later chapters, so don't worry if it's a little confusing atm.</p>\n<p>Reviews/comments/questions/etc are always welcome!!</p>\n<p>PS: anybody who says Aizawa Shouta isn't an inherently passionate and caring person can catch these hands, being less expressive doesn't mean shit!!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Chapter 3 done! How does everyone like it so far? I personally feel like Aizawa was probably more talkative in high school, before he got into official Pro Hero work.</p>\n<p>Also, I know it's mostly been third-person focused on Aizawa and Izuku, so I'm thinking of adding a later chapter more from Hizashi's perspective. Let me know what you guys think!</p>\n<p>See you for the next chapter soon!</p>\n<p>Hey all, notes at the beginning this time, as just a warning: Izuku has a panic attack this chapter. It does have to do with the story, so it's necessary, but just keep it in mind as you read! If you need to skip, please don't push yourself to read it!</p>\n<p>As always, please let me know what you think of this chapter - and the story so far!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Izuku is a happy boi for once!!!! Shouta doesn't know it yet but he would die for that green bean's smile</p>\n<p>Sorry for a shorter chapter this time, I hope you all like it anyways - and oh my gosh!!!! This story has over 100 kudos and nearly 900 hits?!?! What the heck, I feel so loved in the club tonight</p>\n<p>Next chapter is going to be tooth-rotting fluff before we move back to the angst, I hope you guys look forward to it!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Another shorter chapter, but one I hope is still good!! Plenty of fluff is good for the soul you know! Principal Nedzu low-key adopting Izuku without Izuku realizing it is my new favorite thing now lmao</p>\n<p>Also, prepare for pain... we return to the angst next chapter &gt;:)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Ahh, the dreaded cliffhanger!!!</p>\n<p>Welp, it's official, i'm super mean to characters in fics!! I can't help it, my evil fingers type what they will! I hope you guys are enjoying the fic so far. Don't worry, I promise it gets better, but it uh... gets worse before it does.</p>\n<p>Shouta is ready to murder some peeps, better hope he doesn't find you in the future bakugou (also sorry ik i'm making bakugou super evil in this fic but I can't help it aaaa)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Ahhh, it's finally here! Izuku tells them he's from the past and it goes... well?!?!? The green bean is so happy he has friends now and he deserves them so much.</p>\n<p>Also! A small note to my lovely readers!!<br>THANK YOU!!!! Your support means the world, and each comment, kudo and bookmark makes me so, so happy. I haven't properly written fanfic in a long time, so it's wonderful to have it received so positively! I'm so glad everybody's enjoying it, and I really look forward to writing more because of you guys!! I hope you all decide to keep with the story and see it to the end with me.</p>\n<p>See you in the next chapter!<br>- daylightbreaks</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Izuku gets told he can be a hero!! His first step towards his dream!</p>\n<p>This chapter was mostly an excuse to write nothing but fluff and then wholesome at the end I hope you guys like it lmao</p>\n<p>Next chapter is also fluff, but with plot development! Hope to see you guys there!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Uhh... oops?

  "text": "<p>Izuku Midoriya learned at the tender age of four that not all people were created equal. With tears in his eyes, he was told that he was quirkless - and it was like a stab to the heart. His mom, burdened with the thought that her son would never be able to be like his heroes, could only say \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Somehow, that stung him worse. For a while, he thought maybe a quirkless person <em> could </em> be a hero - but the knowledge that not even his mom believed he could weighed on his heart.</p>\n<p>His childhood friend - though he could hardly call him that now - only drove that thought further in. Bakugou Katsuki was special. He was strong. He was always the leader. Everyone always praised him wherever he went, and Izuku\u2019s young mind could only figure that it was because of his powerful quirk. He proudly declared that he was going to surpass All Might one day, and that Izuku would be better off left in the dust, a useless, quirkless <em> Deku</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Quirkless people can\u2019t be heroes. </em>\n</p>\n<p>And so it came to pass that Izuku Midoriya learned that being quirkless was the same as being a second-class citizen. Nobody batted an eyelash when it came to his existence. If they did, they coddled him - treated him like a baby, completely helpless.</p>\n<p>Izuku Midoriya was far from helpless.</p>\n<p>By age 5, his parents had gotten divorced. He wasn\u2019t sure why - <em> I\u2019ll tell you when you\u2019re older, sweetie, </em> his mom had said - but he felt like it was his fault. Maybe his dad didn\u2019t want anything to do with a quirkless child? He wasn\u2019t sure, but all he knew was that his mom didn\u2019t take it well. She became withdrawn, quiet, nervous, and distant, even from her own son.</p>\n<p>It was hard on him at first, when he\u2019d look at her with tears in his eyes and ask her why she didn\u2019t talk to him, but he grew to not ask any more. She never did, so why bother? He started his first journal then, just barely learning to write, talking about anything a child might. What happened at school, how good his writing was becoming, and what cool heroes were on TV. If he couldn\u2019t be one, well, he could at least look up to them.</p>\n<p>One whole journal was filled with nothing but facts about All Might, crude, child-like drawings adorning every other page. It was one of his most prized possessions, and when he got older, it would grow into a Hero Analysis study habit. He just couldn\u2019t help himself.</p>\n<p>By age 6 he\u2019d learned to cook for himself. He burned his hands a couple of times, but it wasn\u2019t anything he hadn\u2019t felt before. His mother cooked once a week, if that, but Izuku didn\u2019t mind. If it was the only way he could do something useful, he\u2019d take it. His mother ate in her room and barely spoke. He hoped she was okay\u2026 he honestly couldn\u2019t tell any more.</p>\n<p>It was like that a lot.</p>\n<p>By age 7, when Izuku received his first long-lasting scar from Bakugou\u2019s quirk, he thinks to himself <em> if only I wasn\u2019t quirkless. </em> But the thought leaves as quickly as it comes, because the last thing he wants to be is helpless, so he endures it. He endures every remark and burn and lashing he receives, and his mom doesn\u2019t say a word except to drive him to the doctor\u2019s when it was something he can\u2019t take care of at home. It wasn\u2019t the only scar he received that year.</p>\n<p>By age 8, Bakugou was a terror for him, always chasing him after school with his quirk activated. Bakugou wasn\u2019t the only one, either - other kids also seemed to beat him down at the blond\u2019s insistence. Izuku, at this time, began to wonder if it was what he deserved.</p>\n<p><em> Is this what I get for being Quirkless</em>?</p>\n<p>Nobody bothered to stop it. The teachers all knew - they\u2019d seen the burn marks and bandages and red, blistered skin, yet nobody said a word. Izuku assumed it was like this for every quirkless person. It was normal, because he wasn\u2019t normal. He was what everybody said he was - a quirkless, useless, freak of nature Deku.</p>\n<p>This was just what he deserved, right?</p>\n<p>By age 10, Izuku felt like he had more scars than skin. He couldn\u2019t stand looking at himself in the mirror. He knew what he was, what his place in the world was. It made him sick to think about his life outside of heroes, so every chance he got he threw himself into hero worship and analysis. He\u2019d had so many notebooks filled, no longer the ramblings of a child but of somebody who\u2019d learned to analyze a survival situation.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d had plenty of survival situations already.</p>\n<p>At age 11, he discovers his new favorite hero: Eraserhead. He was hard to find any information on, being an underground hero, but he\u2019s fascinated by a man that essentially fights quirkless, one-on-one on an even playing field with his opponent. It instills in Izuku a hope he hadn\u2019t felt since he was a child, and he quickly consumes any and all media he can find related to Eraserhead. He has an entire book about him, now, too, right next to the one of All Might he made as a child. It\u2019s his for sure most prized possession.</p>\n<p>Izuku finds himself doodling Eraserhead\u2019s goggles in class one day, and Bakugou has a field day with him. His words sting more than he thought they would.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHe can only fight evenly with his own quirk, you idiot! Stupid Deku! You\u2019re below anybody with a quirk, you can\u2019t fight anybody!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku silently cries himself to sleep for the first time in a long time, clutching his notebook of Eraserhead facts to his chest. He knew it, of course, but it was hard to find hope in anything as he got older and older. Nothing seemed worth it, and he wondered if even Eraserhead would look down on him like everybody else did. It hurt to think about, and his chest felt tight as his hopes were crushed again, and again, and again.</p>\n<p>By age 14, Izuku Midoriya only felt empty. He understood why his mother was so quiet. It hurt too much to be anything else.</p>\n<p>When All Might - one of his personal heroes - shows up in front of him, saves his life from a villain, all he can manage to ask is a single question: <em> \u201cCan somebody who\u2019s quirkless be a hero?\u201d </em>All Might\u2019s answer rips his heart out. If he felt empty before, it was nothing compared to the searing pain he felt down to his core. He shouldn\u2019t have expected anything else.</p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019s good to have a dream, but you need to consider what\u2019s realistic. I don\u2019t think you can be a hero today without a quirk. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku wished he\u2019d never asked.</p>\n<p>Another year goes by, Izuku feeling just as empty. The day that Bakugou gets his acceptance letter to UA, he comes over just to brag and shove it in his face. To tell him just how <em> useless </em> he is, <em> shitty Deku. </em> Izuku doesn\u2019t need Bakugou to tell him what he already knows. He\u2019s holding his Eraserhead notebook, and when Bakugou spots it, the blond grabs it and incinerates it. He can\u2019t even manage to cry seeing the ashy pages break apart and flutter to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You should take a swan dive off the roof and pray for a quirk in your next life!\u201d </em> he says, stomping away like he\u2019s had some great victory. Izuku agrees with him. Maybe it would be better.</p>\n<p>At age 15, Izuku Midoriya stands on the edge of a rooftop, ready to fall.</p>\n<p>He takes a breath and looks at the ground. <em> It\u2019s okay,</em>\u00a0he thinks to himself, <em> Mom\u2019ll have it easier now. Everyone else will, too. Even me. I\u2019m gonna be selfish, just this once. </em></p>\n<p>He takes a step forward and the ground\u2019s not underneath his feet any more. He feels weightless, he feels alive, his body thrumming with energy and hope for peace after he\u2019s gone. What Izuku doesn\u2019t expect is light, even before he hits the ground. A bright, white light, blinding him, and he\u2019s falling into it gracefully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next time he can register anything, it\u2019s the opposite, completely black. He\u2019s floating in some kind of void, feeling absolutely nothing around him. Silent, endless. He wonders if he\u2019s dead, but then a voice speaks to him.</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m so sorry! I saw you falling and I had to use my quirk on you, you were going to kill yourself! I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to you, but my quirk sends things to different points in the past. I can\u2019t control when or where you\u2019ll appear, but you\u2019ll be there for a while\u2026 Please, convince somebody you\u2019re from the future and get them to save your life at that time! When your time in the past is up, you\u2019ll reappear where you left, in the middle of falling, so you really have to stress how important it is that they be there for you! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Also, don\u2019t let them mess with your life before you jump - it\u2019ll mess up your timeline, and then you wouldn\u2019t have ever been there in the first place! They can\u2019t change a single thing about your life before you jump, otherwise they\u2019ll forget you existed and you\u2019ll forget they existed. So just make sure you understand and that they understand. I kind of freaked out, so it may take longer for you to get back to your time\u2026 At least around a month or two on your end? I can\u2019t tell exactly, but you\u2019ll feel it pulling you about a day before you\u2019re due back! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Please don\u2019t let yourself die! You should live! </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku processes this, but doesn\u2019t say anything. Whoever this voice is - the owner of the quirk - stopped him from dying by sending him back in time? He supposed that\u2019s what the light was that he fell into, almost kind of embarrassed that somebody caught him trying to die. He wonders if he could write about the time travel quirk in his new journal some time, but doesn\u2019t make an effort to think about it that hard. He\u2019ll be dead in a month, or at least he hoped so.</p>\n<p><em> Good luck! </em> The voice supplies, <em> Stay safe in the past, wherever you end up! </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta Aizawa was a quiet, reserved - and, at least, outwardly appearing - sort of cold person. It didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t care, of course, quite the opposite in fact! He cared quite a lot, intense in everything he does, he\u2019s just better about keeping it under wraps. He figures that too many people knowing what he\u2019s feeling at any given time only gives them the advantage, and plus he\u2019s tired most of the time anyways. He likes people just fine, but he likes peace and quiet more.</p>\n<p>Then when he attends U.A for the very first time, he meets Hizashi Yamada, the ever-loud and boisterous young man who seems determined to be a part of his life whether Shouta likes it or not. He doesn\u2019t mind, secretly, so he lets the loud man pester him as much as he wants. He finds that after his first month at U.A, he\u2019s found himself completely used to him. They even stay over at each other\u2019s apartments, sometimes, and Shouta feels normal, like the other students in his class. He never says anything, but he\u2019s grateful for Hizashi\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s comfortable in this routine at school, enjoying the peace that it affords while he studies to become a Pro Hero. He likes it this way, and so does Hizashi. He\u2019s going to turn 16 soon, excited for the start of his second year, and ready for the end of his first.</p>\n<p>The <em> last </em> thing Shouta expects is, while walking home, a blindingly white, incandescent portal to explode open just above him. He reacts defensively, prepared for anything, when suddenly, a <em> boy </em> falls through it, and out of nothing more than pure adrenaline and reflexes, Shouta catches him. Hizashi stares, dumbfounded, looking between the boy and the portal as it fades out of existence. The boy is unconscious, still as death, but still breathing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSh-Shouta! What the hell?! Who is that?!\u201d Hizashi yells, and Shouta says \u2018shh!\u2019 in response, gesturing with his head to the boy\u2019s sleeping form.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is, but he\u2019s unconscious, and look at his arms.\u201d Shouta whispers, gesturing with his head. His arms are scarred beyond anything he\u2019s seen in his 15 years, and he knows in his heart that whoever this is isn\u2019t evil. Hizashi seems to feel the same thing, and nods. They need to get this boy somewhere safe, wherever he came from.</p>\n<p>They decide the best course of action, not knowing exactly the extent of the boy\u2019s injuries, is to take him to Recovery Girl and the U.A staff for diagnoses. They only hoped the boy wasn\u2019t on the verge of death, because something in Shouta\u2019s chest tightens looking at the boy\u2019s face. He had startlingly soft features, with fluffy, black-green hair and freckles like flecks of paint across his skin. Shouta feels the urge to wrap him in one of his sleeping bags and never let go.</p>\n<p>He hopes the boy will be okay. So does Hizashi.</p>\n<p>In a dreamless sleep, the boy hopes he isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Izuku wakes up with one of the most painful headaches he\u2019s ever experienced. It feels like somebody\u2019s splitting his skull in two with a cleaver, and it somehow feels worse than being burned by Bakugou\u2019s explosions. His eyes flutter open, and the light feels like it\u2019s stabbing him in the corneas. He can hear voices and shuffling going on around him, but none of it\u2019s clear. He wonders if he survived his fall - maybe he\u2019s in the hospital?</p>\n<p><em> No</em>, he thinks, <em> nobody would care if some Quirkless kid died</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c...can\u2026 me? \u2026 wake\u2026 time\u2026 fell\u2026\u201d He makes out somebody speaking, and it sounds like an old woman, but he can barely understand. He wants to go back to sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...awake?\u201d A gentler, deep masculine voice this time. He could only make out one word, but the voice sounded genuinely concerned about whatever it was. Izuku closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, glad to feel that at least his lungs worked properly, even if his eyes and ears didn\u2019t. Whatever situation he was in, he\u2019d just go back to the roof and try again later.</p>\n<p>\u201cHead\u2026 hurts\u2026\u201d Izuku grunts out, his voice hoarse. He tries to sit up in bed, but feels a strong hand gently push him down. \u201cHurts\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLay down,\u201d the masculine voice says. He can hear him now. \u201cGently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku can\u2019t find it in him to protest. The hand is so warm, so gentle, and he finds himself internally craving the contact. He\u2019d laugh at himself if he could, a Quirkless, touch-starved kid, huh? He doesn\u2019t deserve somebody so nice. The hand, however, moves to his shoulder and stays there. Izuku is grateful, even if he knows he doesn\u2019t deserve it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you hear me, young man?\u201d The elderly woman\u2019s voice pipes up again. Izuku nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cLight hurts\u2026 don\u2019t wanna open my eyes\u2026\u201d He gets out. The old woman chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI expect that it would! My, my what an interesting boy.\u201d She says, though it\u2019s meant in a good sort of way, not mean. \u201cDo you remember anything, child? Or are you up for speaking with me right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Izuku murmurs, unsure. \u201cMaybe\u2026 for a little bit I\u2019ll talk. I\u2026 haven\u2019t forgotten anything, I don\u2019t think I have amnesia\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019m so sorry! I used my quirk on you </em> - a voice shoots through his head like a bullet, and the pain is nearly unbearable. Izuku grips the side of his head, softly whimpering, trying to be as quiet as possible. <em> Nobody wants to hear a Quirkless kid cry\u2026 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?!\u201d The masculine voice is back this time, and the hand that was on his shoulder now gently cradles the other side of his head. \u201cRecovery Girl, maybe we should do this another time, he seems like he\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRecovery\u2026 Girl\u2026?\u201d Izuku asks, straining to open his eyes again. The light\u2019s less painful this time, though his headache definitely isn\u2019t. He knows that name. She\u2019s\u2026 the Nurse at U.A, right? The Youthful Heroine? He\u2019s sure he has an entry on her in one of his journals, somewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you know who I am, then! That makes this much easier, but I agree with Aizawa-san, you should rest. For now, can you just tell us your name? That way we know how to address you the next time you should wake?\u201d The elderly voice - presumably <em> the </em>Recovery Girl, which was exciting and terrifying at the same time - asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-Izuku\u2026 Izuku Midoriya\u2026\u201d He murmurs, and the hand that was cradling his head moves to ruffle his hair. He instinctively leans into it, the touch easing the pain in his head just a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet some sleep, Midoriya-san.\u201d The masculine voice says, and it\u2019s not a suggestion. Izuku only nods weakly, head tilted into the hand. He finds himself drifting off again, and in his dreams, all he can think about is the hand in his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to you, but\u2026 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Please, convince somebody you\u2019re from the future\u2026 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Otherwise they\u2019ll forget you existed\u2026 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Please don\u2019t let yourself die! You should live! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku awakens with a start, his headache gone but a panic in his chest. He remembers. He remembers the quirk, what the person had told him, and it\u2019s terrifying. He tried to die, but nothing ever seemed to go right! He had no idea where he was, and now he was causing even more people trouble for appearing in their pasts.</p>\n<p><em> Stupid, quirkless, useless! Couldn\u2019t even die properly! </em> He chided himself, fuming in anger at his own failure. <em> I should\u2019ve chosen a roof where there wasn\u2019t any people\u2026 then I wouldn\u2019t have upset that time travel quirk person\u2026 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake, I see!\u201d Recovery Girl\u2019s voice was warm and inviting, and Izuku blinked a few times before finally taking in his surroundings. He was in a hospital-like room, painted comforting, neutral colors that were easy on the eyes. He was in a hospital bed, too, with sensors taped to his head and chest, as well as an IV.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-Where am I?\u201d Izuku asked, swallowing the anxiety building in his throat. He had a feeling he knew, given who was currently taking care of him, but he almost didn\u2019t want to hear it. He didn\u2019t want to know he was burdening a Pro Hero, burdening the school he could only dream of - not that he dreamed of much any more.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the U.A recovery rooms, dearie. Can you tell me what happened to you? One of the students brought you in, unconscious.\u201d She asked, and he did his best to sit up and look at her. Recovery Girl was old, short, but still cute in her own way, and she genuinely sounded like she worried for him. Izuku knew the worry would leave the second she found out he was quirkless.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d he thought about what the voice had told him. Was he really back in the past? He needed to know that, first, before he rushed into anything stupid. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Recover Girl asked back, almost amused. \u201cIt\u2019s 8:32 in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I mean\u2026 what\u2019s the date?\u201d he pushed.</p>\n<p>\u201cJuly 15th.\u201d Recovery Girl smiled, but Izuku frowned. It was his birthday. It definitely hadn\u2019t been when he jumped. He wondered what his birthday was like, if he\u2019d even been born yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat year?\u201d he asked, and Recovery Girl\u2019s smile left her face. She sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you know you\u2019ve been hit by a Time Travel quirk, then? The year\u2026\u201d Izuku blanched when she told him.</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m 15 years in the past. I\u2019m being born today. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cH-How\u2026 How did you know I time travelled too?\u201d He asked, voice wavering. He couldn\u2019t believe it was actually true, that he was in the past and he\u2019d be forced to stay there until the quirk wore off. <em> You\u2019ll feel it pulling you about a day before you\u2019re due back</em>! The quirk\u2019s owner had said, but he had no idea what they meant. Whenever it was over, he\u2019d die. He\u2019d fall to his death just like he\u2019d planned. He took a breath, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to reflect for a while before he died. See what the world was like before he was old enough to understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there are certain signs. For one, the description from the student who brought you in implied either a teleportation quirk or some other quirk that could displace you. Then when we couldn\u2019t find any record of you in any databases, we knew something was wrong, so we brought in a specialist who knows how to diagnose what quirks were used on a person. He told me, and only me, that you had a time travel quirk used on you.\u201d Recovery Girl explained. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely volatile, and even the slightest change in your own timeline erases the existence of you, here and now. We\u2019ve kept it under wraps for that reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I see.\u201d was all Izuku could manage. It was so hard to wrap his head around. \u201cActually, I\u2026 I\u2019m being born t-today. I\u2019m 15 years in the p-past\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Recover Girl looked aghast. \u201cYou travelled that far back?! No wonder you were in so much pain! The longest dip in time ever recorded was a month\u2026 this far exceeds anything we\u2019ve had. I\u2019m sorry, dear, but I need you to speak with some people about this. Is this your quirk? Did you use it on yourself? It could have massive consequences, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Izuku\u2019s eyes fell, almost taking on a glazed, distant look. He didn\u2019t want to say it, but he knew it would come up eventually. \u201cI didn\u2019t u-use it on myself. It wasn\u2019t used willingly, e-either. Somebody else used their time-travel q-quirk on me without permission. I\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m quirkless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dear, you must be so lost, then. Well, we definitely will need to look into this. Is there anything else you can tell me about the quirk? Did the person who used it on you talk to you about it first, even if it was unwilling?\u201d She asked, and Izuku was taken aback. She made no comment about him being quirkless. It wasn\u2019t even a factor for her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe person\u2026 I never saw them. They used it without me even knowing what was going on. B-But before I appeared here, I was\u2026 somewhere in between? I could hear them talking to me, but I couldn\u2019t see them\u2026 Th-Their voice was so vague, I couldn\u2019t even tell you who it was if I heard them again. But they said they had no control over when or wh-where I\u2019d appear. Just that I\u2019d\u2026 go somewhere. They said I\u2019d be here for\u2026 maybe a month or two? And then I\u2019d feel myself being pulled back when it was time to go\u2026 A-And I\u2019d reappear at the same time and place I\u2019d left.\u201d He explained, but then something seemed to go off like a lightbulb.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ah! And they also said the same thing as you. Th-They knew it would have consequences if I h-had my timeline messed with. They told me to make sure anybody who knew I time travelled knew that too\u2026 so that I could get back s-safely.\u201d He said, fibbing only on the safely part. He knew what was going to happen when he returned, but it wasn\u2019t her business.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, it seems like they at least understand the nuances of their quirk. And they must create some sort of space to talk to you in before sending you off\u2026 interesting. Anything else? Were they doing this for a reason? Was it a villain?\u201d She asked, and Izuku shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not a villain. They seemed sorry for doing it, like it was an accident, o-or a reflex, maybe.\u201d He replied, laying his head on the pillow. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t t-tell you much else\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries, dearie, no worries. Now, the students who brought you in were quite worried for your wellbeing! Would you allow them to visit you if you\u2019re feeling up for it? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be relieved to know you\u2019re doing alright, though I\u2019d hold off on telling them about your situation. I think you should talk to our principal before any major decisions, too, he may have some advice.\u201d She smiled, and Izuku felt warmed in a way he hadn\u2019t since he was a child. Recovery Girl was genuinely concerned for his health, and not in a coddling way - even though he was quirkless? It almost didn\u2019t compute for him, but he nodded anyways, tears in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yes, it\u2019s okay for them to s-see me.\u201d He sniffled. At the very least, Izuku wasn\u2019t going to have the two students worry over a quirkless kid. They were probably Pro Heroes in his time, and it made his heart numb thinking about burdening them in their past.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then, dearie, I\u2019ll make the arrangements. You just get all the rest you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta and Hizashi had an inkling of an idea what was going on when they were pulled aside by Recovery Girl after school that day, but when they heard that Izuku was awake, both of them nearly sprinted to the nurse\u2019s office to see him. They both wanted to know that he was okay, something in their hearts insisting that he be looked after. Not that Recovery Girl couldn\u2019t, of course, but they felt the need to do their own checkup.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-san!\u201d Hizashi was the first one to burst into the room, nearly making Izuku jump out of his own skin. Shouta followed behind, quietly, face relaxing once he saw that the boy was indeed awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cU-U-Um\u2026 h-hello\u2026\u201d The boy\u2019s voice was so quiet they barely heard him. Hizashi grinned, swiftly taking a seat by Izuku\u2019s bedside.</p>\n<p>\u201cHiya! I\u2019m Hizashi Yamada, and you must be Midoriya-san, right? Shouta told me your name the other day!\u201d He grinned. Izuku\u2019s face turned a beet red, and Hizashi chuckled. \u201cNo need to be embarrassed! Just call me Hizashi. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, though, you really scared the crap out of us, falling from the sky!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I, I\u2019m really sorry about that\u2026 I-I didn\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201d Izuku seemed to make himself smaller, almost shying away from Hizashi. Shouta came closer, putting a hand on the boy\u2019s head, and he seemed to realize something. \u201cYou were\u2026 i-in my room when I first woke up\u2026 r-right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Shouta replied gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re awake. You fell out of the sky unconscious, so uh, I guess it\u2019s normal to worry about your health. What was that, anyways? Some kind of quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026 I-I got hit accidentally by somebody else\u2019s teleportation quirk.\u201d He smiled wearily, and Shouta could tell he was lying. Midoriya really wasn\u2019t very good at it, it seemed. He wasn\u2019t going to press the issue, though, what happened to him was his business.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, that must\u2019ve been a trip! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re alright, though, man!\u201d Hizashi gave a grin and a thumbs up. \u201cWhere are you from, then? Your family must be worried sick about you!\"</p>\n<p>Izuku was silent, eyes cast down. He didn\u2019t have anything to say to that. Shouta could tell he was uncomfortable with the question, so he ruffled the boy\u2019s hair and changed the topic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can tell us where you\u2019re from another time. I still haven\u2019t introduced myself yet. I\u2019m Shouta Aizawa. Hizashi and I are both first-years here at U.A. What school do you go to?\u201d He asked, hoping it was a better question. Izuku only shrunk further, and Shouta sighed. Clearly not the right thing to ask, then.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. whatever the case, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re awake. Recovery Girl will take good care of you while you\u2019re here, and then you can go home.\u201d Shouta said, voice soft. Izuku\u2019s face scrunched up, and they could tell he was about to cry. Hizashi scrambled for the box of tissues on the small end table by the bed, handing him some.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t go home\u2026\u201d Izuku sobbed. \u201cI-I\u2019m not even supposed to be here\u2026! I was s-supposed to\u2026 it should\u2019ve been over\u2026!\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Over? </em> Shouta thought, <em> What was supposed to be over? </em></p>\n<p>Much of the rest of their visit had gone like that, Izuku getting worked up over the questions they asked and Shouta feeling like an idiot for saying the wrong thing. He knew it wasn\u2019t intentional, but he still couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for upsetting the kid.\u00a0 Well, that kid was technically the same age as him, but he just looked so startlingly young. His round face and big eyes didn\u2019t help, though Hizashi kept insisting it was adorable the next day in class.</p>\n<p>Hizashi wouldn\u2019t shut up about Midoriya! It was all he could talk about, and it was starting to give Shouta a headache - <em> fluffy hair! </em> this, and <em> so cute! </em> that. Shouta could only sigh and shake his head, knowing that whatever Hizashi was hyperfixed on, he definitely wouldn\u2019t let go of.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Shouta! You gotta admit, it was pretty cool, him practically falling out of the sky into your arms! It\u2019s like it was meant to be!\u201d Hizashi teased at lunch. Shouta shot the blond a glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever. We barely know him, and he can\u2019t go two minutes without bursting into tears.\u201d Shouta deadpanned, and Hizashi rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what?! He went through a traumatic experience, I\u2019m sure! It\u2019s to be expected. When he gets better, maybe you can get his number.\u201d Hizashi wiggled his eyebrows, and Shouta\u2019s eyes narrowed at him. He scoffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh, sure. Because that\u2019s the normal thing to do in that situation. Hey, you just got over something horrible, wanna call me some time? That\u2019ll go great. Besides, it\u2019s clear <em> you </em> have a crush on him from how much you gush about him all day.\u201d Shouta grumbled. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not interested in a relationship right now. Maybe not ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoo, you\u2019re no fun.\u201d Hizashi pouted. \u201cThat\u2019s your choice though, dude, I respect that. Are you still gonna go visit him after school every day, though? I think he enjoys the company, even if he does freak out a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so. It feels like the right thing to do.\u201d Shouta said softly, burying his head in his arms, preparing to take a nap. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeck yeah, of course I\u2019m gonna visit! Midoriya-kun needs <em> somebody </em> to talk to besides Recovery Girl, or I think he\u2019d go crazy.\u201d He said, and they both only nodded. They\u2019d been in Recovery Girl\u2019s office before, and it felt like they were gonna explode with boredom the entire time. \u201cYou know, I wonder what he\u2019s gonna do. Summer break starts in a couple days, so he won\u2019t be able to stay here\u2026 his family still hasn\u2019t come and picked him up yet, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Was Shouta\u2019s curt reply, but he\u2019d secretly been wondering the same thing. Midoriya had lied about being hit by a teleportation quirk, but he didn\u2019t know exactly what his situation was. Whatever the case, surely he\u2019d have family or a guardian or something to come take care of him, right? Even though Shouta lived on his own, he still had his mother and father in a different prefecture who could come and get him if necessary. He hoped Midoriya had somebody in his life, anyways - being stuck in the U.A nurse\u2019s office for summer break would <em> suck</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku still laid in bed in the afternoon, his body recovering from the shock of travelling so far into the past. According to Recovery Girl, going beyond a certain time has negative effects on the body, like dehydration, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and all sorts of various side effects like migraines and light sensitivity. He\u2019d mostly gotten over the migraines in the past day or two, but Recovery Girl insisted that he heal slowly, as she didn\u2019t know how the Time Travel quirk had affected his body, if at all. She didn\u2019t want to risk using her own quirk on him, just in case it triggered some sort of reaction and hurt him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello!\u201d A cheerful voice called, the door to Izuku\u2019s room opening. Inside, a sort of\u2026 mouse/bear/dog hybrid appeared, bubbly but with an undertone of dark secrets. Izuku\u2019s instincts said he couldn\u2019t lie to him if he tried, so he knew that being honest was the best bet. \u201cI\u2019m Principal Nedzu, the leader of this fine school! I was informed that we had somebody brought in by students, and Recovery Girl has informed me of your particular situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-Okay\u2026\u201d Izuku murmured, not sure what he should say. The principal only smiled at him, seemingly assessing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I can tell you weren\u2019t lying about coming here unwillingly. Still, so far in the past\u2026 a curious thing, no? You must be quite nervous. I\u2019m glad our students brought you here, however, so we can deal with the ramifications. Likely, whatever universe you came from is altered now, aside from your own timeline. Since you\u2019ve appeared, our memories will be altered, we\u2019ll know you\u2026\u201d the principal went on a tangent about time and space and how they would be affected. Normally Izuku would be fascinated, but right now he couldn\u2019t muster up the energy no matter how hard he tried. He was just so exhausted.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d Nedzu stopped himself, \u201cI do love to ramble, don\u2019t I? Anyways, the long and short of it is that you should be fine. Most events are inflexible points in time, so you shouldn\u2019t be able to do any real damage, even if you tell other people about your situation. That\u2019s entirely your choice, though, if you wish to tell anybody. So long as you stay out of trouble, you should be fine - that means no interacting with yourself or your family, as that could cause a paradox. No interfering in major events, no matter how important they are to you! You could wipe out your own existence somehow, you never know how much of an impact you could have. Overall, I think if you have a quiet place to stay, you can go back home just fine in a month or two, just like the quirk user said.\u201d Principal Nedzu explained. Izuku nodded, taking it all in.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright\u2026 W-Well, I don\u2019t really have a place to st-stay while I\u2019m here\u2026\u201d he said softly, just as the door was opening to his room again. Shouta and Hizashi, the boys who had brought him in, had come in, not realizing he was speaking with somebody.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrincipal Nedzu!\u201d Hizashi sounded surprised, \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t know you were talking to Midoriya-kun, yo! We can leave if we\u2019re interrupting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all, not at all!\u201d Principal Nedzu smiled, a mischievous gleam in his eyes. \u201cActually, we were discussing Midoriya-san\u2019s situation. Due to the effects of the quirk used on him, he\u2019s unfortunately cut off from home for a while. He has nowhere to stay, so we were figuring out where he might go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way! That\u2019s no good, huh?\u201d Hizashi seemed to think, then a lightbulb popped up in his head. \u201cShouta! Why doesn\u2019t he stay with you? You live by yourself in that giant apartment, you could both use some company!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Shouta trailed off. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s o-okay, I don\u2019t want t-to be a bother on a-anybody\u2026 I\u2019m s-sure I can find my own w-way.\u201d Izuku spoke up, resolute. \u201cIt\u2019s only f-for a month or two, I-I can take care of m-myself for that long, I\u2019m sure\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA month or two?\u201d Shouta asked, eyebrows raising. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time to be on your own. I mean, I don\u2019t really cook much or anything, and I\u2019m not very exciting company, so I feel like I\u2019d be bothering you more than anything else\u2026 But if you really need somewhere to stay for that long, I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s better than being on the street.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Izuku bit his lower lip, worrying it between his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t think y-you\u2019d want me in your a-apartment\u2026 I\u2019d j-just put a strain o-on you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t. It would be more of a strain knowing you were just by yourself for that long\u2026\u201d Shouta muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s not very hero-like of me to just leave you be, I guess. So\u2026 y\u2019know, you can stay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d Principal Nedzu chimed in, \u201cThen I\u2019ll mark Midoriya-san\u2019s file as staying with you for the time being, Aizawa-san. I\u2019ll be sure to have the school compensate you in order to alleviate any finance issues for the duration of his stay. Meanwhile, Midoriya-san, would you mind coming in once a week for exams to make sure the quirk has no other negative effects while you\u2019re here? It would be an interesting study for us as well, if you\u2019ll allow it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I-I dunno if I can r-really be all that useful, but i-if you\u2019ll have me\u2026 I guess I d-don\u2019t have much of an option\u2026 A-And thank you, Aizawa-san\u2026 it\u2019s very g-generous of you\u2026\u201d Izuku muttered, face turning red from a mix of shame and embarrassment. He felt horrible for burdening a U.A student like this, but he knew he couldn't do much. He would just wait to die when the time was up, not wanting to risk ruining their timelines. He was going to make everyone's lives easier, even if it meant suffering for another while. It would be better when he was gone.</p>\n<p>\"It's no big deal.\" Shouta said simply, shrugging like he didn't care either way. \"I'll come get you when your stay in Recovery Girl's care is done.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sweet!\" Hizashi grinned, giving a thumbs up. \"I'll come visit you too, Midoriya-kun! We'll make sure you have an awesome summer break, even away from home! No sense in feeling all down because of something you can't control, dude!\"</p>\n<p>\"Th-Thank you\u2026\" Izuku said, smiling weakly. Even he couldn't keep away from Hizashi's infectious smile and personality, it seems - and seeing Midoriya smile, even a little, relaxed Shouta and Hizashi both. It was good to know he had relaxed around them enough to not cry this time, though Shouta was determined to figure out exactly what happened at some point.</p>\n<p>\"Of course! Now, you just take it easy.\u201d Hizashi insisted. \u201cI brought you some snacks! Hospital food sucks\u2026 Er, sorry Recovery Girl\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhaha, it\u2019s no problem. I\u2019m glad Midoriya-san already has people looking after him.\u201d The older woman said. \u201cAs long as he gets his rest and doesn\u2019t stress himself out, he should be able to leave the day that summer break starts. You all should come get him after school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect, perfect!\u201d Principal Nedzu rubbed his paws together mischievously, like he knew something the others didn\u2019t. Then again, he looked like that often\u2026 none of the students really knew what went on in his mind. \u201cAh, and Midoriya-san, you might want to consider talking about your situation with Shouta if you\u2019ll be living with him, in case of any strange side effects of the quirk. Your departure might be sudden, after all. Well, Recovery Girl and I will take our leave and let Midoriya-san visit with his friends. Make sure you two get home on time, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Principal Nedzu! Bye, Recovery Girl!\u201d Hizashi waved as they made their way out of the door. He pulled some different convenience store snacks from his school bag, and offered them to Izuku, who shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m okay\u2026 I\u2019m not v-very hungry, but I appreciate the th-thought\u2026\u201d he said, to which Hizashi pouted. Izuku seemed to look at him, feeling bad for rejecting the blond, so he spoke again. \u201cIf you want to leave them on the t-table\u2026 I might eat some later\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHah, nobody can resist your pout, Hizashi.\u201d Shouta snorted. \u201cExcept me, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just cause your soul is as black as the clothes you wear, dude. Seriously, you gotta lighten up your wardrobe some time!\u201d Hizashi bickered, and Shouta just rolled his eyes. Watching them act like friends was interesting for Izuku, and it made his heart ache for something he knew he couldn\u2019t have. He knew he\u2019d never have a life like they did; he\u2019d resigned himself to his fate a long time ago. But it was still nice watching the two U.A students, pretending he could be a part of their social circle. <em> They\u2019ll find out I\u2019m quirkless eventually, </em> he thought, <em> but maybe it would be nice to pretend to be normal before I die\u2026 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways, Midoriya-san, when you stay with me, just let me know if you need anything. You can let Hizashi know too, he\u2019s been over to my apartment plenty of times.\u201d Shouta explained. \u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t cook much so I hope you don\u2019t mind a lot of simple foods\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-Oh, I can cook! And clean! I-It\u2019s the least I can do for lending me a place to stay for so long, after all\u2026 Although, um\u2026 I-I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to w-wear\u2026\u201d Izuku flushed. Shouta shrugged, then looked between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re about the same size, so I guess you can borrow some of my clothes for now. If it bugs you I can take you to get something new with the money Principal Nedzu sends my way.\u201d Shouta suggested. \u201cKnowing that guy, he\u2019s already thought of everything, so there\u2019s no reason to worry. If you really feel up to cooking, that\u2019s up to you, but I\u2019m not gonna force you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! What Shouta said. Don\u2019t worry about it, just focus on getting better, right?\u201d Hizashi smiled. Izuku smiled back, and for the first time in a long time, he felt like he could relax.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The day of Izuku\u2019s release from Recovery Girl\u2019s care came quickly, and Shouta pulled Hizashi aside to set some ground rules. He knew the blond wouldn\u2019t do anything too reckless, but sometimes he had a habit of doing things without realizing what was going on around him. He just wanted to be sure he respected Izuku\u2019s boundaries, because it was very obvious that he wasn\u2019t in the best place mentally, judging from how easily he became upset, and how little he seemed to want to talk about himself. They were standing outside of Izuku\u2019s room in Recovery Girl\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>\u201cHizashi, just remember not to pressure him into talking about himself. He doesn\u2019t really like it. He should tell us about what happened if he wants to, even if Principal Nedzu thinks it\u2019s necessary. I don\u2019t wanna make either of our summer breaks uncomfortable.\u201d He said, putting his hands on Hizashi\u2019s shoulders for emphasis.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course! You got it, Shouta. No personal talk. Just keep it fun.\u201d he nodded firmly, and Shouta sighed, relieved he understood.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. I knew you\u2019d get it. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d He gestured, and they went inside. When they opened the door, they were met with Izuku sitting on the edge of the bed in a fresh pair of clothes, ones he hadn\u2019t been wearing when he came in. He was wearing a plain, black tee with a pair of jeans, and a fresh pair of shoes. Principal Nedzu was also there with him, talking about something.</p>\n<p>\u201c... Just remember the rules, Midoriya-san. Those kinds of quirks aren\u2019t very well understood yet. We don\u2019t know what kind of ramifications it could have.\u201d he said, almost stern. Izuku nodded quickly. Shouta and Hizashi felt like they\u2019d intruded. What was he talking about? Rules? Ramifications of a quirk? Did it have to do with how Midoriya fell out of a portal?</p>\n<p>\u201cOf c-course, Principal Nedzu. Thank you very much\u2026 Ah! Aizawa-san, Yamada-san\u2026 y-you both came to get me?\u201d Izuku smiled, and this time it seemed genuine. It was bright, beaming, and it melted both of the U.A student\u2019s hearts like butter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Shouta coughed, turning his head to hide his embarrassment, \u201cthis guy never leaves. Sticks like gum on a shoe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Mean, Shouta!\u201d Hizashi pouted. Shouta rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot mean if it\u2019s true.\u201d He responded. Hizashi only stuck out his tongue, then turned back to Izuku, faux-ignoring his friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways, call me Hizashi! No need for formality if we\u2019re gonna be hanging out all summer break. Can I call you Izuku?\u201d He asked, sticking out a hand to shake. Izuku stared at it like he didn\u2019t know what to do with it, like it might just go for his throat or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026 I-Izuku is f-fine if you want\u2026\u201d he gulped, staring nervously as he reached for the hand. They shook softly, and as Hizashi let go, he made a mental note that even the palms of his hands were scarred - there wasn\u2019t an inch of visible skin that didn\u2019t have something marring it, though neither Shouta nor he ever brought it up. It wasn\u2019t their place, and they knew it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Hizashi said, pushing down the urge to ask personal questions. \u201cIzuku-kun, I can tell we\u2019re gonna be awesome friends already, huh Shouta?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, you make friends with everyone, Hizashi. You\u2019re practically contagious.\u201d Shouta snorted. Hizashi gave a gasp of mock anger.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe? Contagious?! How dare you?!\u201d He joked, but even at the fake anger in his voice, Izuku flinched. Shouta didn\u2019t say anything, but Hizashi got the message. \u201cOh, sorry, Izuku-kun, I was just kidding. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS-Sorry\u2026 H-Habit\u2026\u201d Izuku murmured, holding his arms shyly.</p>\n<p>Shouta could tell he was in for a long summer break.</p>\n<p>The first thing that Izuku noticed when he entered Shouta\u2019s apartment was that it was\u2026 surprisingly clean? With how much the black-haired teen slept (several naps had been taken in the chair by his bedside), he was surprised he got anything done at home at all. Yet there was something in his demeanor that the cleanliness made sense against - a serious, no-nonsense sort of expression that came off in his personality sometimes. Izuku, in all honesty, appreciated it like a breath of fresh air - it meant that no matter what he did, how useless he was being, at least he\u2019d know exactly how Shouta was feeling.</p>\n<p>It was different than Bakugou\u2019s loud and brash sort of honesty, where he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to burn somebody he didn\u2019t like. Shouta\u2019s was\u2026 well, different. He wasn\u2019t sure how to put it. And Hizashi, well, Izuku quickly learned that he was a verifiable burst of sunshine. Always happy, always excited, never offended, always bouncing back. No matter what happened, nothing seemed to faze him, like he was untouchable in his own sort of way. Unattainable almost, like he was the personification of the happiness, the sheer joy in living one\u2019s life that Izuku couldn\u2019t reach with his own scarred, two hands. He wished he could touch that happiness, now matter how many more scars he had to burn onto his palms to touch that sun.</p>\n<p>They were polar opposites, yet Izuku couldn\u2019t imagine one without the other. He knew they were best friends, it was easy to see in the nature between them. He wondered who they were in his time, but he didn\u2019t know if it was alright to ask that sort of thing, especially considering he hadn\u2019t even told them his own story. He wasn\u2019t sure if he could, knowing how it was going to end. It was a strange feeling, facing one\u2019s own morality, inherently different from throwing oneself towards it like he had a few days ago. Was that even right? A few days for him, 15 years in the future for them. Even if he had told somebody, like the quirk user suggested, he wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d remember in 15 years. It was a long time to wait for one quirkless kid on a roof.</p>\n<p><em> It doesn\u2019t matter</em>. Izuku told himself. <em> I\u2019ll be here for their summer break, and then I\u2019ll be dead. I\u2019ll be out of their hair, along with everyone else\u2019s. I just can\u2019t do anything to mess up their timelines. I\u2019d be even worse than quirkless if I ever did something to ruin the career of a U.A student! A Pro Hero in the making! </em></p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku.\u201d Shouta\u2019s gentle rumble of a voice pulled him from his thoughts. Right, the apartment. Izuku sure let his thoughts wander. \u201cHere\u2019s the guest room. Make yourself at home. Hizashi\u2019s going to get take-out tonight, so don\u2019t even think about cooking.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said it like he already knew Izuku was going to do it, whether he asked him to or not. Izuku probably would have.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Thank you for your kindness, Aizawa-san. I know it\u2019s asking a lot-\u201d <em> from a quirkless kid like me, </em> he bit off in his thoughts, \u201c-and you didn\u2019t have to, so, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku didn\u2019t stutter once, and he felt a strange sort of pride bubble in his chest at that. It was only around his mother, when he was younger, that he\u2019d been able to keep his nerves down like that. It felt nice to be that calm again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I told you it would make me feel worse knowing you were fending for yourself the entire break, so I guess you can see it as doing <em> me </em> a favor in this case, if it makes you feel any better.\u201d Shouta murmured, digging around in a hallway closet for something. He pulled out a pillow and blanket, and handed them to Izuku. \u201cHere. For your bed. And listen, you don\u2019t have to call me Aizawa-san. Just Shouta is fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, of course, thank you A\u2026 Shouta-san.\u201d Izuku bowed his head, taking the blankets gratefully. In his other hand, he clutched his backpack and bag of old clothes like a lifeline. He didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d managed the 15-year jump, but he wasn\u2019t going to complain. It was some beacon of familiarity in an otherwise completely different life. He peered his head into the guest bedroom, where a futon had already been rolled out for him. There was a small table beside it, and a sliding door closet with nothing but another spare futon and pillow inside. Izuku gently placed the blanket and pillow he was given on top of the futon on the floor, and his backpack and change of clothes inside the closet, off in the corner and out of sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, like I said, go ahead and make yourself at home. I\u2019m going to get changed out of my uniform, probably read a book or something until Hizashi gets here. Enjoy the quiet while it lasts.\u201d He laughed dryly, though it seemed more out of amusement than anything else. Izuku nodded, unsure what he should do, or was allowed to. If it were his own house\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d No response. Shoes off at the door. Tend any wounds. Quietly sit at the table, finish the homework. Cook dinner. Eat. Leave out a portion for mom. (Maybe I\u2019ll see her. Maybe I\u2019ll be so lucky.) Clean up the mess. Go to my room. Watch Hero videos. Write down anything new I can find. (Maybe there\u2019s a new clip of Eraserhead?) Listen to Present Mic\u2019s radio show while I write. Shower. Go to bed at a reasonable hour. Wake up. Do it again. </em>\n</p>\n<p>It was always like that. Thinking about the stillness of his own house set Izuku\u2019s anxiety on fire with a blowtorch, so he settled on making his bed instead. Easy enough to focus on, but he wished he had Present Mic to listen to while he worked. Something about the Pro Hero\u2019s energy almost reminded him of Hizashi, a bright blur of a person improving anybody\u2019s mood.</p>\n<p>When his bed was made, he sat there for a few minutes, staring at every detail in the room. It really wasn\u2019t his own, and even being here in the past still felt like some kind of fever dream. He wondered briefly what was going on back in his time, but his heart sunk to process that\u2026 nothing was. It wasn\u2019t his time any more. Even when it <em> would </em> be his time, he\u2019d reappear the second after he left, still falling. He was holding up other people\u2019s lives, being here. Was he, technically? Izuku didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s how time worked with these quirks. Whatever the case, it still felt like he was doing the wrong thing any given second. He needed to get his mind off of things.</p>\n<p>He felt that same itch of not knowing what to do, of the compulsion to be doing something, to feel <em> useful</em>. He decided that the least he could do was finish his homework. It wasn\u2019t very\u2026 helpful, he supposed, but it would make him feel normal at the very least. He went and got his backpack, fished around for a minute, and dug out a pencil and the sheets he\u2019d been working on. It was simple math and English, the kind you\u2019d expect from somebody entering high school, and the sheer normalcy of it was calming. He sat at the small table for a while, filling in the answers and doing the work.</p>\n<p>When he was done, it seemed like a while had gone by, though not a very long time. Maybe an hour. Time was still weird. Izuku went to write his name at the top, and his mouth went dry. The date in the corner stared back at him like a slap to the face. He really wasn\u2019t there in his own time anymore. He wasn\u2019t home. He was in the past, bothering two U.A students/Pro Heroes because a useless, <em> quirkless, Deku can\u2019t do anything right, stupid stupid, just go take a swan dive- </em></p>\n<p>A sharp intake of breath made him realize he\u2019d dug his own nails into his palm, hard enough to break skin. He huffed, realizing that they were going to bleed, and cursed under his breath. Well, at least the homework was done. He had a first aid kit in his backpack, no big deal. He dug around again, only to realize - he didn\u2019t have it. Of course he didn\u2019t. The one day he wouldn\u2019t have brought it, he wouldn\u2019t have thought he would need it. He was supposed to be dead. What use would a first aid kit have been?\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> No, stupid, no, useless, can\u2019t do anything right, shitty Deku. </em> He hoped Shouta had a first aid kit and wouldn\u2019t ask too many questions. Izuku didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to take it. He gently padded outside of the room, looking around for Shouta, and found the teen lazing around on the couch in the living room, legs curled underneath himself and a book in his lap. He seemed so peaceful, and Izuku couldn\u2019t help but stare for just a moment, regardless of the blood on his palms or not - though he was subconsciously careful not to let any drip onto the floor.</p>\n<p>Shouta was wearing a pair of black sweatpants, with a white tanktop that had a print of a cartoon kitten\u2019s head on it. His hair, long enough to just brush his shoulders, was still damp as if he\u2019d taken\u00a0 shower, and he had a towel around his neck. His eyebrows seemed to be relaxed, finally, from their eternally scowling position. He looked so\u2026 gentle. Without even looking up, Shouta seemed to know he was there, though - he turned the page of his book and spoke up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you just gonna stand in the doorway?\u201d he asked, nearly making Izuku jump. The green-haired boy let out something close to an \u2018eep!\u2019 before scurrying inside the living room like he\u2019d offended somebody by existing. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cU-U-Um, Sh-Shouta-san, do you have a f-f-first aid kit?\u201d he asked, almost quiet enough to be missed. Shouta looked up with a concerned expression and got up from his place on the couch, noticing how Izuku cradled his hands gently. Shouta pulled a small box from a bookshelf, and gestured with his head for Izuku to join him on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s o-okay, I can h-handle it, I don\u2019t want to t-trouble you-\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice was cut off by a half glare from Shouta, and he swallowed weakly. Shouta pointed to an empty spot on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit.\u201d he insisted. \u201cI told you already, you\u2019re not trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku couldn\u2019t find the power in him to protest. He simply sat down next to the other teen, who waited patiently, silently, to see what was wrong. When he finally willed up enough courage, Izuku unfurled his hands, stretching his arms out so Shouta could get a better look. Izuku turned his head, his face scrunching up like he was waiting for the other boy to rip his arms off. Instead, the black-haired teen simply took one of Izuku\u2019s hands in his own, gently touching it. He didn\u2019t say a word, and Izuku\u2019s face relaxed, watching in reverence as Shouta treated his wounds.</p>\n<p>He was gentle, touching his hands like he respected them, and Izuku stared blankly. He didn\u2019t deserve for Shouta to be so gentle with him, like he was his friend - he\u2019d been stupid enough to hurt himself in his house, and now was making Shouta care for his wounds. How could he? What right did he have? Shouta should be yelling, screaming, calling him everything Bakugou did - but there was nothing. Shouta cleaned the blood, applied a salve, and small bandages on the palms of his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku...\u201d Shouta started, like he wanted to ask what happened. When he was done, he simply sat, staring at Izuku\u2019s hands held in his own. He wouldn\u2019t ask what he\u2019d done, he didn\u2019t want Izuku bursting into tears, so he settled with: \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cH\u2026 Huh?\u201d Izuku looked at Shouta like\u2019d just sprouted three heads, confused as all get-out. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m fine! You were very k-kind, taking care of m-m-my hands, I took up your r-reading time, so o-of course I\u2019m okay!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what that has to do with you being alright, but sure. As long as you\u2019re okay.\u201d Shouta nodded, packing the first aid kit back up. He put it back up, pulled his book back down from the shelf, and went right back to reading as if he\u2019d never stopped in the first place. Izuku wanted him to say something, anything, tell him how useless and helpless he was - anything was better than the silence. It felt too normal, too real, too friendly, he didn\u2019t deserve it, he wasn\u2019t like them. He felt his skin crawl and burn with the desire to know <em> why </em>, itching until he couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore, he had to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2026 Why would you help me?\u201d He blurted out before he could think about it. Shouta blinked, clearly not expecting the question.</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you a bunch of times already? It was better than thinking you were on the street, fending for yourself.\u201d He replied simply, but Izuku shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026 No\u2026 I mean\u2026 Why\u2026 why would you help <em> me?! </em> \u201d He asked again, the words coming out before he could stop them, like waterfalls from his mouth. There were tears in his eyes, and he said the next thing in a tone akin to admitting to murder. \u201cI-I-I\u2019m <em> q-quirkless</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s hands flew to his mouth like he\u2019d just committed the ultimate taboo, and he curled up, knees to chest, breath coming in heaving gasps. Shouta, realizing what was happening (Recovery Girl had briefed him on panic attacks before he left), quickly moved to Izuku\u2019s side. Of course, at this time Hizashi chose to enter, take-out in hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, Shouta, Izuku-kun, I got-\u201d he stopped as soon as he saw Shouta pulling a blanket over Izuku\u2019s shoulders, gently putting a hand on his shoulder like he had at the hospital. He saw the breathing, the crying, and Hizashi registered what was going on as well. He quickly placed the food on the coffee table and kneeled on the floor by Izuku\u2019s side, taking the other shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, we\u2019re here.\u201d Hizashi said softly. He was better at the talking part than Shouta was, and the other teen was grateful for that. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re safe in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looked like he wasn\u2019t even registering what was going on around himself, and Hizashi paled, looking to Shouta for help.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened, dude?\u201d he asked quietly, to Shouta.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, he hurt himself, and I bandaged his hands, but then he asked me why I was helping him and said he was quirkless. I don\u2019t know what happened to make him so upset\u2026\u201d he said, then slowly, \u201c... though it did seem like him saying he was quirkless was the trigger for the panic attack.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cStupid, useless, quirkless, shitty Deku, stupid\u2026 </em>\u201d Izuku muttered under his breath, and Hizashi\u2019s eyes went wide. He looked to Shouta, who looked equally as shocked at what was coming out of Izuku\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, you\u2019re here in Shouta\u2019s apartment, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Hizashi tried his best to reassure him, rubbing small circles against his shoulder blades. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid, you\u2019re not useless. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stilled completely at that, and then all of a sudden, collapsed into a heaving, sobbing mess. He leaned against Hizashi, his entire body wracked with sobs. The blond did his best to hold him up. The boy was about as heavy as a wet noodle, of course, so it wasn\u2019t that hard. When Hizashi wrapped his arms around Izuku in a sort of hug, Izuku\u2019s hands clutched at his shirt and held on for dear life. It seemed to help, though, the reassurance that there were other people. Shouta also moved his hand to Izuku\u2019s hair, remembering how it had helped in the hospital.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, Izuku.\u201d Shouta murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re not useless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After he\u2019d calmed down, Izuku was entirely silent the rest of the night, his eyes distant like he wasn\u2019t paying attention. He even ate without making noise, and it was extremely eerie, hearing just how quiet somebody could be while they ate. Hizashi insisted he stay the night in case of another emergency, and honestly, Shouta wasn\u2019t going to complain. Izuku still hadn\u2019t let go of Hizashi\u2019s shirt since the panic attack, but neither of them wanted to remove him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, it\u2019s getting late. Do you want to get some sleep?\u201d Shouta asked, and Izuku finally managed a nod. \u201cThat\u2019s good. We\u2019ll take you to the guest room, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi and Shouta both stood, Izuku following in tow. When they made their way inside, they saw his bag and homework on the table, almost managing a smile at something so normal. Izuku\u2019s fist finally unclenched, and he made his way silently towards the bed. Hizashi followed, and as Izuku laid down, he helped tuck him in. Shouta watched the strangely domestic sort of scene with a weary heart, worried so much for the green-haired boy. This was the sort of situation Heroes didn\u2019t deal with on TV - day to day, recurring problems, like Izuku had. Helping him through it was suddenly so much more valuable to Shouta than any Hero he\u2019d ever seen in videos.</p>\n<p>When Hizashi moved to leave, however, Izuku made a small noise, a flicker going through his eyes as his hand reached out to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cP-Please\u2026 Please stay\u2026\u201d he said, voice crackling. Hizashi didn\u2019t have the heart to say no. Instead, Shouta moved to the closet and set up the other futon for his friend. Hizashi made up the bed and looked down to Izuku, who was watching him with those emerald eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Izuku-kun, I\u2019m just gonna talk to Shouta for a minute, okay? I\u2019ll be right back, I promise. I\u2019ll be right outside the door if you need me.\u201d Hizashi pointed. Izuku nodded, his eyes returning to the distant look they had earlier. The two other teens stepped out of the room, shutting the door, and Hizashi let out a breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Shouta tilted his head back, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have a panic attack an hour after getting to my apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all new for him, yo, and we have no idea what happened before he got here. I don\u2019t think Recovery Girl or Principal Nedzu knew how bad it was going to be, or else they wouldn\u2019t have sent him home with you. This is, like, next-level messed up, Shouta. Did you hear how he was talking to himself?\u201d Hizashi asked quietly. Shouta nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I heard. But I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to take care of him.\u201d Shouta said, firmly. Hizashi gave a halfhearted chuckle. \u201cWhat? I couldn\u2019t call myself a Hero, even an underground one, if I left him now. Heroes always go for the flashy stuff, defeating villains and helping with natural disasters. But what about the people who suffer every day? Who\u2019s their heroes? You saw how he clung to you, Hizashi, he wasn\u2019t like that with Nedzu or Recovery Girl. I think it\u2019s better to stay with the people he\u2019s comfortable with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHah,\u201d Hizashi laughed a little, \u201cyou always talk about how much you hate the flashy heroes and being the center of attention, but here you are, talking all big. I agree with you, but it\u2019ll be really tough. He\u2019s really messed up, Shouta. You ready to deal with all of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d He said firmly. He wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure his stay here is the best he can get. Can I be selfish and ask for your help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were gonna get my help anyways, dude! I\u2019ll have to talk with my family about it, but I\u2019m sure that if they understand the situation, then they\u2019ll be fine with me staying here as much as possible. That is, if you don\u2019t mind me being in your apartment all summer, haha.\u201d Hizashi said, and Shouta seemed relieved by it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Hizashi. You\u2019re welcome for the whole break, just like Izuku. But we\u2019ll figure out the details later, right now we should focus on him.\u201d Shouta gestured to the door with his head. Hizashi nodded, and the blond took his place back at Izuku\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cHizashi\u2026 san\u2026\u201d Izuku murmured sleepily, hand outstretched as if for a handshake. Hizashi grasped it, laying down next to him. Just the simple amount of human contact had Izuku out like a light, and Hizashi felt his heart melt.</p>\n<p>Maybe, just maybe, he and Shouta could pull this off.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Izuku woke up to the smell of breakfast and an empty room. The realization that he\u2019d had a panic attack and admitted he was quirkless washed over him, and he felt sick to his stomach. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d said it like that, and then of all things, Hizashi and Shouta had been so\u2026 gentle. So patient, so quiet\u2026 they were <em> there</em>. In a way nobody in his life had ever been. They had said things he only wished somebody had said to him years ago.</p>\n<p>\n<em> You\u2019re not useless. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s heart ached to hear those words again, but it was too much for him to ask for. Right now, he would just take things as they came. One day at a time, until he could get back to his own time. Anything from Shouta or Hizashi would be welcome, whether it was quiet dismissal now that they knew, or even pretending they\u2019d never heard him say it. He could only wish for such a thing.</p>\n<p>On the floor in front of his futon was a change of clothes and a towel, as well as a note written on top. Izuku picked it up, finding neat, almost formal handwriting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em> Izuku, here are some clothes for you. The bathroom is down the hallway and to the left if you\u2019d like a shower. Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask if you need anything; Hizashi and I are both still here. If you\u2019d like to talk, that is your choice. If not, then that\u2019s fine as well. Just take your time and make yourself at home, like I said before. </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em> - Shouta. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was so simple and to-the-point, but the undercurrent was that they knew. They <em> knew</em>, and they <em> acknowledged </em> that he was quirkless, and they weren\u2019t kicking him out. Izuku clutched the note to his chest, a silent gesture of thankfulness he\u2019d never be able to repay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku did decide to take the shower, if only because he felt the need to thoroughly clean himself for the first time since his stay with Recovery Girl. It felt more refreshing than he\u2019d expected, and was surprised to see that even bath products had been left out for him. When he made his way out into the living room, he now had on a pair of colorful lounge pants and an oversized tee that had another cartoon cat on it. He supposed it was Shouta\u2019s, then.</p>\n<p>\u201cH\u2026 Hello\u2026\u201d Izuku mumbled, seeing that from the kitchen, Hizashi and Shouta were bickering bout breakfast. Or, at least it sounded like it was about breakfast, Izuku wasn\u2019t sure. At the sound of his voice, though, they both turned and smiled, and Hizashi bounded over, still the ever-present ray of sunlight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey Izuku-kun! Good to see you up and about! Want some food? Shouta tried his best, but I think it\u2019s a little burnt\u2026 well, it\u2019s still edible, anyways!\u201d He joked. Izuku smelled the food, and nodded, immediately his stomach fired up. \u201cLooks like we got a taker!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, here.\u201d Shouta put a few plates on the table. The food, while simple (Shouta had said as much, anyways, and Izuku would <em> never </em> dare to complain) still looked great. He wasn\u2019t a terrible cook at all, and Izuku felt warmed and excited at the prospect of eating with other people. He hadn\u2019t eaten with his mom properly in a long time, so even if they were silent the entire time Izuku was grateful. Last night was an exception, of course, given he was entirely out of it. He hated the fact that he wasted his first meal with them like that, and the shame of it burned like coals in his stomach. Nevertheless, Izuku was determined, now, not to make a fool of himself, and have a normal meal at the table. He was <em> not </em>going to panic, and he wouldn\u2019t ruin their meal again.</p>\n<p>\u201cTh-Thank you.\u201d he said softly, taking a seat. He was joined by Hizashi, and then Shouta, after they finished cleaning up the cooking mess. They said a quiet \u2018itadakimasu\u2019 and then started eating. Izuku\u2019s eating was shy, but he wasn\u2019t eerily quiet like he had been last time, and it was much better for the other two.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Izuku,\u201d Hizashi began, slowly, after finishing a bite, \u201cI wanna know something new about you, but I know you don\u2019t like talking about yourself, so I was hoping you could tell me something interesting! Whatever you like, just something about yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tensed. He\u2019d been expecting questions, but he thought they\u2019d mostly be about his lack of a quirk, not just\u2026 get-to-know-you stuff like they did at the beginning of school years. He could do this, though. He wouldn\u2019t let them down. There was really only one thing he found interesting about himself, so he supposed it was all he could say.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 like heroes.\u201d he mumbled, face red. Hizashi grinned widely.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeck, me too! Shouta and I wanna be Pro Heroes! Although this guy wants to be an underground hero, so, y\u2019know. Mr. Fun Police over here.\u201d Hizashi stuck out his tongue at Shouta, who only sighed. \u201cWhich heroes do you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-All Might\u2026\u201d Izuku said, his skin complexion slowly becoming closer to that of a tomato. He\u2019d never just casually talked to people about his hobbies before, not without Bakugou exploding in his face. \u201cHe\u2019s r-really cool\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone loves that guy!\u201d Hizashi beamed. \u201cHe\u2019s the Symbol of Peace, after all! I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody that doesn\u2019t. Who else, who else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cU-Umm\u2026\u201d Izuku thought about Eraserhead, but he knew that the time he was in was likely Eraserhead\u2019s high school years - so probably, they\u2019d never heard of him, since he didn\u2019t exist yet. \u201cSome other ones, I dunno\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s pretty cool, Izuku-kun! Now I know something about you, why don\u2019t we tell you stuff about us? Anything you wanna know?\u201d Hizashi asked, leaning forward. Izuku thought about it for a second, and then he thought of something.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I hear about y-your\u2026 Your quirks? I like a-analyzing them\u2026\u201d he said, eyes wide with hope. Seeing that look on his face, they couldn\u2019t tell him no.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure thing! Mine\u2019s an Emitter-type quirk that I call Voice! Basically I just yell really loud and bust some eardrums.\u201d Hizashi grinned smugly, and Shouta seemed to get a kick out of it, actually laughing a bit. Izuku hadn\u2019t heard his laugh before, and it was almost endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd mine\u2019s also an Emitter-type. Erasure. I can stop other people\u2019s quirks by looking at them. Not super flashy, but good for underground hero work.\u201d He shrugged. Izuku froze. Voice? Erasure? He\u2026 he knew those quirks.</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Y-Y-Y-You\u2019re\u2026!\u201d His eyes went wide, in awe like he\u2019d just discovered the meaning of life. So then, these two were some of his favorite Pro Heroes, and he was just\u2026 staying in Eraserhead\u2019s apartment?! Wearing his clothes?! Present Mic had held his hand?! As he realized this and seemed to be processing it, he paled. \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku? Everything alright?\u201d Hizashi asked, looking a little confused seeing him go from awestruck to blanched in a matter of seconds. Izuku\u2019s eyebrows scrunched and he started muttering to himself, thinking intensely. He didn\u2019t seem to be having a panic attack, though, which was good - now they just had to figure out what the heck was going on this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they\u2019re\u2026 then I\u2019m\u2026 but the rules said\u2026 what if I do something to\u2026\u201d Izuku muttered and muttered, paying no mind to the other two at the table any more. Shouta and Hizashi only seemed to catch bits and words, not really able to make anything out completely. Eventually, the muttering slowed down, and Izuku took a breath. \u201cAh, sorry, I-I\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to g-go off on a tangent like th-that\u2026!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Shouta murmured, taking another bite of his food. \u201cWhat were you thinking about? Seemed important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImportant\u2026?\u201d Izuku\u2019s fists clenched, white-knuckled. \u201cY-Yeah\u2026 I guess so\u2026 b-but that\u2019s okay! I just realized s-something is all, but it\u2019s n-not that big of a d-deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d Shouta said simply, and it wasn\u2019t a sarcastic sort of remark. It was normal, almost serious, as if to say <em> if you say so, then I believe you</em>. Izuku smiled again at that, and instantly the room felt light again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Shouta-san.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After breakfast was finished, Izuku realized how late he\u2019d slept. It was the most peaceful sleep he\u2019d had in a long time, somehow unconsciously comforted by Hizashi\u2019s presence in the room. He still felt the need to do something, though - on summer breaks at home, he\u2019d spend the entire time cleaning and analyzing quirks, but he didn\u2019t want to overstep boundaries here.</p>\n<p>Hizashi had gone home in the afternoon, stating that he\u2019d be back tomorrow after a talk with his family, so it just left Shouta and Izuku at the apartment. He didn\u2019t mind the space, it honestly felt roomier than the one he and his mother stayed in - but the burning itch to feel useful was crawling over his skin and making his scars tingle. Shouta was on the couch, reading again, and Izuku was cleaning up his mess of homework from the day before.</p>\n<p>Cleaning gave him some relief, but it didn\u2019t feel like it was enough. He considered asking Shouta if he could clean something else in his apartment, but it already was fairly well-kept aside from a couple of things here and there. The other thing he wanted to do was watch Shouta use his quirk, see \u201cEraserhead\u201d in action before he was actually known as Eraserhead. Had they even picked their hero names yet? Izuku felt so strange, being out of his own time. He wasn\u2019t sure how close to the line he could toe without drastically changing things. The fanboy in him screamed to get more information on an otherwise virtually unsighted hero. Only one clip of Eraserhead had ever surfaced, and it was so blurry and shaky you could hardly tell what was going on.</p>\n<p>The other, more self-conscious side of himself told him absolutely <em> not</em>.</p>\n<p>So, cleaning it was. He just had to ask. It was like payment for staying here anyways, right?</p>\n<p>\u201cSh-Shouta-san\u2026\u201d Izuku mumbled, again standing quietly in the entryway to the living room. Shouta\u2019s eyes rose from the book in his lap, silently asking him to continue. \u201cI w-was wondering if\u2026 U-Um\u2026 If there\u2019s anything I-I could c-clean\u2026 for you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClean?\u201d Shouta rose an eyebrow curiously. \u201cI said before you don\u2019t have to worry about that kind of stuff. You\u2019re welcome to read a book or watch T.V, or if you need anything else, you know, I can go get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cN-No, I\u2026\u201d Izuku fidgeted, almost embarrassed to say anything at this point. \u201cIt\u2019s j-just that\u2026 At my house, c-cleaning helps me r-relax\u2026 It gets my m-mind to stop th-thinking for a while, which is\u2026 nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Shouta said, getting up from his place at the couch. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s something you really want to do, I suppose it couldn\u2019t hurt anything. Just so long as you\u2019re not doing it because you feel like you have to or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cN-not at all! I want to.\u201d Izuku insisted. Shouta put his book back on the shelf and then turned to Izuku, mouth drawn into a thin line like he was thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, can I make a request of you in return, then?\u201d Shouta asked. \u201cI know I said I wouldn\u2019t press on the issue, but I really want to know something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Izuku steeled himself for whatever question was coming. It was only fair of him to want answers, it <em> was </em> his apartment and his hospitality he was living off of. The urge to do something overrode his anxiety and self conscious thoughts, anyways. \u201cW-Whatever you want to know, I-I\u2019ll do my best to answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy were you so upset yesterday after telling me you were quirkless? I don\u2019t understand why something like that would be so upsetting. I just wanted to see if I <em> could </em>understand, that\u2019s all.\u201d Shouta stuffed his hands in his sweatpants pockets, staring at Izuku softly through his bangs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy it would be upsetting?\u201d Izuku asked, worrying his lip again. His expression was something between anger and loathing. \u201cB-Because\u2026 quirkless people a-aren\u2019t any good. Th-They don\u2019t do a-anything. Can\u2019t <em> be </em> anything. They\u2019re\u2026 <em> I\u2019m</em>\u2026 u-useless. I\u2026 I don\u2019t know wh-why you let me stay after I t-told you\u2026 I just thought you\u2019d\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know. Anyways, that\u2019s why I k-kinda freaked out\u2026 I-I\u2019m sorry. I know it\u2019s a sh-shameful thing\u2026 And I l-lied to you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta seemed to take all of this in, choosing his words carefully before he spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lie to me, Izuku. Neither Hizashi or I ever asked about your quirk status, so there was nothing <em> to </em> lie about. It\u2019s not shameful, and you\u2019re not useless. I have no idea who put that kind of notion about quirkless people in your head, but we don\u2019t care. Quirkless or not, you still needed a place to stay. I wouldn\u2019t turn somebody out to live on the street if I could help it.\u201d Shouta explained, walking over to the sink. He got some cleaning supplies out, and handed them to Izuku, arm outstretched. \u201cHere. I said you could clean after you answered my question. I dunno what you\u2019d want to clean, but whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku felt almost lightheaded hearing Shouta - <em> Eraserhead in the future </em> - tell him that he didn\u2019t care if he was quirkless or not. That he would\u2019ve done the same for everyone, implying that Izuku was\u2026 on the same level as him and everyone else with a quirk. It felt surreal, almost like a dream, and he found himself taking the cleaning supplies without a second thought.</p>\n<p>And if he spent the rest of the afternoon meticulously scrubbing the apartment top to bottom with a dumbstruck smile on his face, then that was his and Shouta\u2019s secret to keep.</p>\n<p>The next two days were spent much the same, Izuku quietly scrubbing away in some corner of the apartment with a happy look on his face. Hizashi had come back after a couple of days, too, after having explained things to his own family. They\u2019d given him permission to stay at Shouta\u2019s apartment as long as he liked over the break, wishing Izuku a wonderful stay and recovery. Hizashi said he\u2019d go home sometimes, of course, to do laundry and get things - and his parents promised to send him back with food for Shouta and Izuku when he returned.</p>\n<p>It was near the end of his first week with them when Principal Nedzu had given them a call, asking for Izuku to come in for his first checkup. He informed Shouta he\u2019d provide the necessary compensation for Izuku\u2019s stay then, too. They\u2019d all agreed to go with, needing a breath of fresh air - and afterwards, they\u2019d go shopping for some clothes for Izuku.</p>\n<p>So on that Friday, Izuku sat, this time in Principal Nedzu\u2019s office, with Recovery Girl being present as well. Hizashi and Shouta were forced to wait outside, much to their chagrin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well, Midoriya-san, how are you feeling?\u201d Nedzu asked, smiling at him. Izuku sat in a soft lounge chair, picking at the hem of his shirt nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m doing well. Shouta-san is very kind\u2026 Hizashi-san as well\u2026 they\u2019re making my stay in this time very welcoming.\u201d He said shyly. Nedzu chuckled, and Recovery Girl looked relieved to hear that he was having a decent time so far.</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful to hear! We haven\u2019t noticed any unusual fluctuations in energy since your appearance, so it seems you haven\u2019t done anything to drastically alter the timeline. Like I said, most things are fixed points in time, so it\u2019s difficult to do any real damage unless you\u2019re specifically trying to. The only thing that will have been changed is our memories of you, so it may be a bit jarring for those two if they see you in the future, you know.\u201d Nedzu said, a knowing look on his face. Izuku flushed with embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 how did you know I h-haven\u2019t told them yet?\u201d he squeaked out. Nedzu laughed, mirthful and not malicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fairly obvious if you look for the signs. I would tell them if I were you, Midoriya-san. It would make things complicated later if you didn\u2019t.\u201d Nedzu gave him a firm look, and Izuku just about shrunk in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2026\u201d Izuku swallowed the lump in his throat, thinking about his circumstances back in his own time. It wouldn\u2019t matter if they knew or not once he got back. His expression fell to a somber one. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be\u2026 a-as complicated as you think. I don\u2019t know i-if I want to tell them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, in the end, it\u2019s entirely up to you, Midoriya-san.\u201d Nedzu\u2019s voice turned to a gentle tone. \u201cComplication talk aside, how have you been feeling physically? Have you experienced any strange side effects or difficulties due to the time travel quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cN-None that I can think of. I haven\u2019t had any migraines or l-light sensitivity since I left.\u201d Izuku replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad to hear it, dearie! Now, here, take some gummies and let me check your vitals, just in case.\u201d Recovery Girl passed Izuku a handful of what looked to be vitamin gummies. He ate them quietly, letting the nurse do her checkup. It went normally, and everything seemed to be in good health, except for <em> one </em> thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-san.\u201d Recovery Girl said, tone now serious. \u201cI\u2019m not going to force you to answer, however it\u2019s my duty to ask this question. Your arms are quite severely scarred from what I can see. How did you get those?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy arms.\u201d Izuku\u2019s mouth pursed, his expression unreadable. What came out next almost sounded like he was reading from a script. \u201cI get hurt a lot where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m really clumsy, and since I\u2019m quirkless it hurts more. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see.\u201d Recovery Girl\u2019s voice was as firm as his was. She knew rote repetition when she heard it, and it only confirmed her suspicions. \u201cWell, regardless, I simply wanted to ask. Thank you, you\u2019ve got a clean bill of health from me. Same time next week, yes, dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Izuku said softly. He\u2019d been through those questions plenty of times before. He knew what they meant, and he knew that they knew. Nothing he or they could do about it anyways, not without messing up his timeline.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, Midoriya-san, I will walk you out. Thank you for your time. Next week, I\u2019d like to talk about the quirk more in-depth, but for now, this is fine.\u201d Nedzu said, his knowing sort of smile returning. \u201cI\u2019m sure your friends are eager to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nedzu led Izuku to the waiting room, where Shouta was napping in a chair, and Hizashi was texting on his phone. When Hizashi saw Izuku coming out, he shook Shouta awake and the two stood to meet him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, how\u2019d everything go?\u201d Hizashi asked. \u201cStill not sure what Principal Nedzu here wants with you, but if he\u2019s taken interest it must be pretty big!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, um, yeah\u2026\u201d Izuku shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you ready to tackle the rest of the day, Izuku-kun?!\u201d Hizashi beamed, and Izuku couldn\u2019t help but smile and nod at that. \u201cGreat! We\u2019re gonna find you some cool clothes for you, dude. No more of Shouta\u2019s weird cat clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Shouta grumbled, \u201cCats are cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn any case, Aizawa-san, here is the coverage for Midoriya-san\u2019s stay.\u201d Nedzu pulled an envelope from his suit pocket, passing it to the black haired teen. Shouta opened it, and then went white at the contents.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is too much!\u201d he balked, \u201cThis is like an entire year\u2019s worth of rent!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assure you, it\u2019s not too much at all. It should cover all of Midoriya-san\u2019s clothes, food, expenses, and any other outings you desire. It\u2019s not my place to give the extent, but Midoriya-san has been through an ordeal and we here at U.A would like you two to help make the most of his stay. That includes having fun, you know.\u201d Nedzu gave a calming smile to Izuku, then a menacing one to Shouta and Hizashi. \u201cIf he wishes to discuss his circumstances, that is his choice. What is <em> not </em> a choice, however, is making sure he\u2019s taken care of. I will not hesitate to remove him from your care should I sense anything strange during our meetings. I trust I make myself clear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Shouta and Hizashi gulped. Principal Nedzu was terrifying when he was worried for somebody\u2019s wellbeing\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, then, off you three go! Have a pleasant day!\u201d he chirped, and that was that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hizashi and Shouta took Izuku to a bunch of different shops, but stayed away from the busier ones since they noticed he didn\u2019t do well in crowds. They tried on all sorts of clothes, and eventually settled on a few different outfits to wear. Izuku tended to lean towards plain clothes, and though he hadn\u2019t complained about what he was given before, he had a definite predilection towards covering his arms. Even though it was hot and in the middle of summertime, Izuku very clearly was uncomfortable with his scars being shown in a public setting. They didn\u2019t begrudge him on it, of course, but they wanted his health to be kept in mind - so they compromised with arm covers and short sleeve shirts.</p>\n<p>Izuku was also quiet for the first few shops, though he didn\u2019t seem on the verge of a panic attack like he was at first at Shouta\u2019s apartment. They hadn\u2019t bought much, since Izuku was always reluctant to actually point out anything specific he liked. By the fourth one, though, he finally saw something that caught his eye. He didn\u2019t say a word, but by the gleam of awe in his eyes, Hizashi could tell he wanted something.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatcha looking at, Izuku-kun?\u201d He asked, and Izuku pointed to a hoodie on display in one of the windows. It was mint green and had the word \u201cSTAR\u201d printed on the chest in bold, English lettering. The hood and sleeves were black, with white constellations on them. His eyes sparkled looking at that hoodie, and Hizashi was suddenly a man on a mission.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouta, come here!\u201d Hizashi tugged on his friend\u2019s arm, and then led both him and Izuku into the shop. He looked around for a minute, and spotted some things that were part of whatever plan he was thinking up. He ran through the store scooping up different items of clothing, and eventually came back to hand them all to Midoriya, hoodie included. \u201cHere, here! Try these on!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looked a little confused, but did as he was told and went to the changing room. He was a little nervous, but Izuku knew that Hizashi knew more about fashion than he did. Shouta had flat-out admitted that he knew nothing about clothes and only picked stuff that was comfortable or had cats on the design, so that left all fashion choices up to the blond (and Izuku\u2019s tastes). He began changing, realizing quickly just how much Hizashi had picked out - an entire outfit, right down to the shoes and accessories. When Izuku emerged, he wore the oversized \u201cSTAR\u201d hoodie with black, ripped jeans. His shoes were mint green hi-tops apparently from the same line as the hoodie, having little constellation designs on them as well. The hoodie sleeves were pushed up slightly, just enough to show rubber bracelets with different hero designs on them.</p>\n<p>Hizashi had a shit-eating grin plastered on his face and Shouta was actually <em> blushing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you he was adorable, Shouta!\u201d Hizashi exclaimed proudly, making Izuku\u2019s entire face turn red. He stuttered and began to mumble incoherently, looking down to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I-I\u2019ve never worn anything like this b-before\u2026\u201d he mumbled, voice crackling, \u201cso I was r-really nervous to try it on, and I h-hope it looks good\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look super cool!\u201d Hizashi gushed. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely buying this one!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re s-sure that the money is okay being used on\u2026 clothes?\u201d Izuku asked. The three teens were now back at Shouta\u2019s apartment, with Izuku putting the finishing touches on dinner. They\u2019d finished their shopping, which included an impromptu grocery run at Izuku\u2019s insistence. He\u2019d gathered up all the courage in his body and asked - practically <em> demanded </em> - that he make dinner, since they\u2019d been so nice to him all day. Izuku was still basking in the afterglow of compliments from Shouta and Hizashi, which kept his self-consciousness from rearing its head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, definitely. We would\u2019ve done it anyways, but I think Principal Nedzu would actually murder us if we didn\u2019t do something nice for you, and I <em> really </em> don\u2019t wanna be on his bad side, yo.\u201d Hizashi felt a chill go down his spine at the prospect of a pissed off Nedzu. Shouta only nodded solemnly in agreement, knowing the Principal\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodness, h-he doesn\u2019t come off that way to me a-at all. Maybe h-he was just being nice?\u201d Izuku murmured, though he definitely sensed that the chimerae Principal knew far more about any subject than he let on. He didn\u2019t dwell on it, though - he really wasn\u2019t one to argue, especially since the two U.A students would know their Principal better than he would. \u201cWell, no mind, dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta peered up from his book on the couch - he <em> really </em> loved to read, apparently - and stared at the different dishes being put on the table. They looked delicious, and Shouta found himself fascinated at how natural cooking looked when Izuku did it. On his end, he could barely get by without burning toast sometimes\u2026 not that he\u2019d ever admit it. He got up and took his place at the table, and it began to dawn on him that this looked so\u2026 normal. Like it wasn\u2019t anything new to have Izuku at his place, cooking dinner for him and Hizashi, even though he\u2019d literally only been there for a week. He wondered what that said about him, if anything.</p>\n<p>Steaming bowls of Katsudon awaited them. They all said their thanks before digging in, and immediately Hizashi\u2019s face lit up with joy. Even Shouta\u2019s normally perfect neutral expression was changed to one of shock, an out of character moment <em> twice </em> in <em> one </em> day. Izuku, apparently, had that effect on people. They reveled in the taste of the food, it was absolutely <em> wonderful</em>! It was like something they\u2019d get at a restaurant!</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, oh my god!\u201d Hizashi yelled excitedly. \u201cThis is so good!!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cH-Huh?\u201d Izuku had his own look of shock this time, different than Shouta\u2019s but there nevertheless. \u201cWhat, you think so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 really, really good.\u201d Shouta agreed, turning his attention back to the food. \u201cWhere did you learn to cook like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm, w-well,\u201d Izuku started, sheepishly, \u201cI just kinda started cooking one day. M-My mom, she um, wasn\u2019t always up for cooking, so I just t-took it up myself\u2026 It just stuck, I-I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you totally rock! You could make a killing as a chef somewhere if you wanted! I\u2019m never going back to convenience store lunches and dinners again\u2026\u201d Hizashi clenched a fist dramatically, pretending to be moved to tears. \u201cI will just have to battle you for Izuku\u2019s cooking, Shouta! Prepare yourself!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Shouta rolled his eyes. \u201cIzuku can cook for whoever he wants. Nobody\u2019s gonna force him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d\u2026 like to cook for b-both of you.\u201d Izuku smiled so widely that the corners of his eyes scrunched up. He was genuinely happy they liked his food, and even happier he could share a table with them. \u201cAt home, I-I don\u2019t get to eat w-with anybody very often\u2026 so this is really nice\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi and Shouta could both swear they felt their hearts beat out of their chests at the comment. How in the world did somebody with a smile like the sun just fall - literally - into their lives? They both wondered how they\u2019d gotten so lucky to meet Izuku, but thanked the universe for its blessings. He was just as much of a staple of their lives as anything else, at this point.</p>\n<p>In that small moment of dinner with Shouta and Hizashi, Izuku felt normal. He felt at home. He wondered if this was what life was like for everybody else - if they got to experience this every day. For the first time ever, even if he knew well enough that it wasn\u2019t permanent, Izuku thought that maybe life wasn\u2019t so bad.</p>\n<p>\n<em> At first, it just rumbles. It\u2019s dark, and he can\u2019t see, but he can hear it. Like distant thunder, but getting closer, and suddenly it\u2019s tugging at his scars. They all burn, they all itch, they all ask too many questions. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHow did you get those?\u201d Recovery Girl\u2019s taut voice, like she\u2019s about to say it, but she doesn\u2019t. She knows. His scars burn hotter. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhy were you so upset yesterday after telling me you were quirkless?\u201d Shouta\u2019s gentle, concerned voice. His scars itch with the overwhelming desire to apologize. To make himself useful in return. He doesn\u2019t deserve such a gentle voice. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI would tell them if I were you, Midoriya-san.\u201d Nedzu\u2019s voice. This time, it\u2019s not his scars that burn, but his heart. He\u2019s ashamed. Guilty. He knows he should say something, anything. It\u2019s better than nothing. But how can he say it when he\u2019s already\u2026? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a dream, but you need to consider what\u2019s realistic.\u201d His hero\u2019s words fill his lungs until he can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s drowning in the swirling mass of emotions he can\u2019t quite pick out. He can\u2019t feel anything. He\u2019s numb. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> The thunder isn\u2019t far away any more. It\u2019s in his ears, in his eyes, scorching, burning, clawing, marking, making sure everyone knows what he is. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Stupid. Useless. Quirkless. Worthless. Less than human. Unloved by even his own mother. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Deku. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYou should take a swan dive off of the roof and pray for a quirk in your next life!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He\u2019s tried. One more thing he couldn\u2019t even get right. His skin feels like it\u2019s about to tear itself to shreds. He fights the urge to pick at his own scars. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI\u2019d like to cook for both of you.\u201d His own voice cuts through the air, followed by damning silence. He feels sick. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> What right does he have to announce that with a smile? They should both have beat him into a bloody pulp for his insolence. Bakugou would have. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Bakugou. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> The name sends a hand of fire to encase his heart. It hurts, it\u2019s gripping so tight, he can see his face, oh god, he wants to put up his arms and fight! He can\u2019t. His arms won\u2019t move to his face, the one part of himself he\u2019s managed to keep scars off of. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI\u2019ll kill you properly this time, you fucking Deku!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta woke up with a start, hearing thunder outside and yelling and sobbing in the next room. He threw the covers off of himself and raced to the guest room, only to find Hizashi trying to wake up Izuku from what seemed to be a nightmare. The green-haired teen was thrashing in his sleep, hands up to his face like he was trying to keep from being hit.</p>\n<p>\u201cB-Baku-Bakugou\u2026! P-Please s-s-stop\u2026!\u201d Izuku chokes out. Shouta has no idea what he\u2019s dreaming about, but it couldn\u2019t be good. He kneeled next to Izuku, moving his hands away from his face as gently as possible. He grasped Izuku in a gentle hug, and Hizashi did the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, wake up. Please, you\u2019re just having a nightmare.\u201d Shouta said softly, running a hand through Izuku\u2019s hair. Hizashi held Izuku\u2019s hand in his own, head on his shoulders in an effort to console him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, you\u2019re okay, we\u2019re here, you\u2019re okay. Wake up, wake up.\u201d Hizashi offered, and suddenly, Izuku\u2019s eyes were wide with all the fear of an animal going to slaughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Izuku cried out, the yells petering into choked sobs. He clutched onto Shouta and Hizashi for dear life, like if he let go he\u2019d be murdered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 please, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh,\u201d Shouta felt his dry eyes burn with tears he couldn\u2019t work up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Izuku. It was a nightmare. You\u2019re in my apartment, remember? Hizashi and I are right here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Was all Izuku could get out, shaking like a leaf. Rain poured against the window, and a crack of thunder had him leaping out of his own skin. \u201cP-Please! I-I\u2019ll do it right! Please!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, you\u2019re safe, it\u2019s just thunder.\u201d Hizashi sounded like he was on the verge of tears himself, not understanding what was wrong but worried for Izuku all the same. Shouta was right there with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTh-Thunder\u2026 Thunder\u2026\u201d Izuku squeezed his eyes shut, flinching every time it rumbled in the distance. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Thunder\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it, just thunder. You\u2019re here in the apartment with Shouta and I.\u201d Hizashi said, and Izuku nodded as best he could. He had one hand holding onto Hizashi\u2019s with an iron grip, and the other holding Shouta\u2019s now, not letting go for anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn\u2026 In the a-apartment\u2026\u201d He repeated, like he was still trying to ground himself in reality. The only noise was the rain and Izuku\u2019s soft crying, followed by the distant thunder. Each time a lightning bolt would crack, Izuku would let out a strangled \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d before going quiet again. They didn\u2019t know what to say, what would make him feel better, if anything - all the other two teens could do was be there for him, making sure he knew he was safe.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt w-was\u2026 It was a d-dream\u2026\u201d It looked like it was starting to sink in for Izuku, and he finally slumped over, the muscles in his body relaxing. He still wouldn\u2019t let go of either of his friends, but they were fine with it. Neither Shouta nor Hizashi were going to leave him unless he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Shouta nodded, other hand still in Izuku\u2019s curls. \u201cJust a dream. It wasn\u2019t real.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sat like this for nearly an hour, quietly trying to help Izuku get back to them. The rain finally slowed down, though it was still dark, and the thunder finally left them. It was only after Izuku hadn\u2019t heard the thunder for a while that he finally seemed to fully relax. His eyelids were heavy from crying, and he leaned closer to Shouta\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cC-Can you stay too?\u201d Izuku asked, voice barely above a whisper as he looked up at Shouta. The black-haired teen nodded, carefully laying down with Izuku so that both he and Hizashi could stay with him. With a shaky sigh, Izuku was finally back to reality. He had them with him. He was safe. It was a dream. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I-I\u2019m sorry for w-waking you both u-up\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize for that, Izuku-kun.\u201d Hizashi murmured, head still gently leaning on Izuku\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019d rather you be alright than wake up later knowing you suffered through it by yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly what Hizashi said.\u201d Shouta agreed. \u201cYou never need to apologize for things out of your control, especially nightmares. Everybody gets them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d Izuku\u2019s hands trembled as he tried to talk about it. \u201cI thought he was going to\u2026 p-put a scar on my face\u2026 I-I couldn\u2019t\u2026 It\u2019s the only p-part that I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThought who was going to scar your face, Izuku?\u201d Shouta asked, voice just barely wavering. Somebody had put those scars on Izuku\u2019s arms, then. It was another person\u2026 Shouta was full of rage at the thought that another person could do something that heinous.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d Izuku deflected the question, \u201cIt was j-just a dream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Shouta said simply. He wasn\u2019t going to push it right now. He\u2019d ask another time, when Izuku wasn\u2019t so shaken up. As much as he feared Principal Nedzu\u2019s wrath, he knew it would be necessary. Whoever did this to Izuku\u2026 He didn\u2019t even want to think about it.</p>\n<p>It was quiet again. With his limbs and hands tangled with Shouta and Hizashi\u2019s, Izuku could finally get back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku yawned, eyes fluttering open to the sunlight peering into the apartment window. It was bright outside, and he felt so warm and heavy. It was a reassuring sort of feeling, and he wished it would stay all the time. He turned his head to see Hizashi at his side, and then turned again to see Shouta on the other. Izuku blinked, not processing for a second before it hit him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d had a nightmare last night. He\u2019d woken them up, and they stayed with him so he could go back to sleep. Izuku\u2019s face went red, embarrassed but comforted. He still could barely understand the fact that they weren\u2019t disgusted by him, let alone that they would be willing to be this close to him. Izuku\u2019s heart hammered in his chest.</p>\n<p><em> Why couldn\u2019t I have a life like this at home? </em> He wondered. <em> I don\u2019t understand\u2026 Maybe I really did die and this is the afterlife, I don\u2019t know. Maybe this is all a dream at my expense, something I could never have. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> I wish I could stay like this forever. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Stay like what forever, Izuku-kun?\u201d Hizashi yawned and stretched, just beginning to wake up. Izuku realized he\u2019d said that out loud and stammered.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I-I mean, y-you know\u2026!\u201d He squeaked. Hizashi grinned stupidly, seemingly catching on through his sleep-addled fog.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, you mean like this, with me and Shouta?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWell, I\u2019m flattered!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s mouth opened and closed like a fish, unable to form words out of sheer bashfulness. Hizashi held his hand just a little tighter, rested his head back on Izuku\u2019s shoulder, and sighed softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can stay as long as you\u2019d like, but maybe eating something would be good, too, at some point.\u201d He joked, and Izuku only nodded. \u201cI\u2019m seriously glad you\u2019re feeling better, though. Shouta and I were really worried, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice was shamed, quiet. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have m-made you two worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you before, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Shouta\u2019s rumbling voice this time, as he stretched and then laid his arm over Izuku\u2019s chest protectively. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize for things you can\u2019t control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cB-But I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo \u2018buts,\u2019 okay?\u201d Hizashi interjected, \u201cYou\u2019re totally fine. It was a nightmare, man, you can\u2019t help that stuff. Shouta and I are happy to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY-You sh-shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d Izuku\u2019s eyes drifted to the ceiling, his look scornful. \u201cI-It\u2019s not r-right. If I\u2019d just d-done it right the f-first time I\u2019d never have\u2026 I-I wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Hizashi sat up, expression concerned. \u201cDone what right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTh-The quirk that sent me here. If I\u2019d just st-stopped and th-thought about it\u2026 If I-I\u2019d done it right it w-would never have hit me. I sh-shouldn\u2019t even be here, m-messing up other people\u2019s lives j-just because I can\u2019t even j-jump right!\u201d Izuku felt hot tears threatening to spill over, and he rubbed at his eyes angrily. \u201cI\u2019m s-such an idiot\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, whatever happened wasn\u2019t your fault! You got hit accidentally by a quirk, you couldn\u2019t help that. Whatever the case is, you\u2019re here now, and you\u2019re not messing up anything!\u201d Hizashi reassured him, but Izuku wasn\u2019t having it. Izuku untangled himself from the two and stood up, pacing the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I did! I\u2019m n-not supposed to be here! I-I\u2019m changing everything j-just being here! Y-Your timelines are\u2026!\u201d He froze, realizing he\u2019d let something terrible slip. Shouta and Hizashi shared a look between them for just a second. Timelines\u2026? Was this something to do with the \u2018repercussions\u2019 they\u2019d heard Nedzu mention back in Recovery Girl\u2019s office?</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, what are you talking about?\u201d Shouta asked seriously. Izuku\u2019s whole body trembled. He didn\u2019t want to say it. He wanted to be selfish, he wanted to keep pretending he could be normal just for a little longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 Please\u2026 I-I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I d-didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d Izuku\u2019s hands clenched and unclenched nervously, and he worried his lip between his teeth. Then, with no warning, he looked Shouta dead in the eyes. \u201cTh-This is why I\u2026 I was so scared of s-saying I was quirkless\u2026 Q-Quirkless people aren\u2019t worth anything\u2026 All I ever do is mess things up. I\u2019m useless\u2026 Now d-do you understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Shouta said firmly, standing and staring right back. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you could think that about yourself. I don\u2019t know what happened before you got here, Izuku, but I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: you aren\u2019t useless. You aren\u2019t trouble. I wouldn\u2019t turn you away, and neither would Hizashi. No matter what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, man.\u201d Hizashi stood up from the futon as well, expression serious. \u201cYou\u2019re our friend. We care about you. Even Principal Nedzu cares about you too in his own way, so don\u2019t go selling yourself short. Quirkless or not, you\u2019re still a person. You\u2019re still here, and you\u2019re still worth all the time in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Izuku\u2019s hands fell to his sides limply. He didn\u2019t know how to properly reply to that, so he just said the first things that came to mind. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 I\u2019ve never had a\u2026 a friend, before.\u00a0 E-Even my mom, she\u2026 she doesn\u2019t t-talk to me. I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not <em> there </em> . I don\u2019t <em> exist, </em> except as a-a stupid, useless <em> Deku </em>. All I can do is m-make people\u2019s lives worse-\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s words cut off as Hizashi ran to him, clutching him in a close hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it.\u201d He said, weakly. The entire time he\u2019d been around Hizashi, Izuku had never heard him speak like that. Like he would break any second. \u201cStop talking about yourself like that, Izuku. Please. It\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is true.\u201d Izuku was completely still. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not!\u201d Hizashi cried, gripping Izuku by the shoulders, now. \u201cWho told you you were useless, huh?! Who told you that you don\u2019t exist?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku was silent, and then: \u201cEveryone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi and Shouta felt their hearts shatter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku was nearly nonverbal for the rest of the day. He\u2019d shut down again, and no matter how much Shouta and Hizashi tried to comfort him, it was like his soul had left his body. By the afternoon, the other two teens weren\u2019t sure how much more silence they could take.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouta.\u201d Hizashi had murmured, away from the guest bedroom. Izuku hadn\u2019t left all day, not even to eat. \u201cThis is\u2026 Maybe we should call Principal Nedzu, o-or Recovery Girl, or something. We aren\u2019t professionals, I think he should talk to somebody, Shouta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not, but who would he talk to? You heard him. <em> Everyone </em> , Hizashi. Not one person in his entire <em> life </em> has been kind to him. Those scars came from another person. Maybe multiple people. How the hell do you expect him to open up to anybody like that?\u201d Shouta nearly hissed, seething with rage at anybody who had treated Izuku poorly. Which was a <em> lot </em> of people, apparently.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Hizashi felt his own brand of anger and horror, not sure which emotion ranked higher on his scale of feelings towards the people in Izuku\u2019s life. \u201cI know, but what else can we do? We\u2019re teenagers, not licensed medical professionals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can <em> be there </em> for him. He opened up to us. The first people to tell him he was a person. If we left him in somebody else\u2019s care now, what would he think? Two more people who just dropped him from their lives because he was quirkless. Because we couldn\u2019t care enough to help him through it. We\u2019d be just like everybody else who hurt him!\u201d Shouta\u2019s voice was barely above a whisper, but Hizashi could practically feel the venom seeping from his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201c... You\u2019re right.\u201d Hizashi admitted, sighing. He put a hand to his temple. \u201cWe would be. I can\u2019t imagine he would take it well, especially after we called him our friend. We can only do our best in this situation, huh? And that means not leaving his side, for as long as he needs us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Shouta\u2019s shoulders finally relaxed, and he slumped against a wall. \u201cFor as long as he needs us. I know Principal Nedzu only said he was staying with us for summer break, but where is he going to go? Back to people who don\u2019t care about him? I think we should tell somebody about this, at least. See if there\u2019s <em> anything </em>we can do for him after his stay here is up. I wish he could just stay here, go to school with us, but we have to do things the right way for his sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t d-do things the \u2018right way.\u2019 Not with my c-circumstances.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice came suddenly, and both Hizashi and Shouta startled to see Izuku standing behind them, looking just as lifeless as he had before. Izuku swallowed, fear and bile rising in equal measure in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think\u2026 I think there\u2019s some things I n-need to tell you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like he\u2019s known them for years. Almost like with Bakugou, but it\u2019s not the same. He knows it isn\u2019t. Bakugou is cruel and burning and mindless in his pursuits to crush Izuku - they\u2019re not like that at all. Hizashi is positive and beaming, with a sensitive side that shows itself from time to time. Shouta is gruff and honest and kind of blunt, but he\u2019s always respectful and intense in a way that Izuku can\u2019t really describe. But always, above all, they\u2019re both <em> so gentle. </em> They\u2019re kind. They listen. They make Izuku feel like a person.</p>\n<p>Is it normal to feel like that about people you\u2019ve known for all of two weeks? He\u2019s not entirely sure. Either way, their gentleness is so comforting it hurts. He craves it. He\u2019s terrified of it at the same time, because what will he do once he loses it? He\u2019s going to die. He\u2019s accepted this as a fact. Once his \u2018month or two\u2019 is finished, he\u2019ll fall to his death from that roof and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it, he thinks. There\u2019s no way anybody would wait 15 years for him.</p>\n<p>And yet, the thought of his death hurts even more, somehow. It hurts because he knows that it would hurt <em> them, </em> even if they\u2019d forget by the time he actually jumped. In his time, they were Pro Heroes - people who didn\u2019t have time to go out of their way to help Quirkless kids with their existential crises. All Might certainly didn\u2019t, and if <em> he </em> didn\u2019t, how could he expect the same of Shouta and Hizashi in 15 years?</p>\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be 15 years for Izuku, though. It would be the blink of an eye - one second surrounded by warmth and bliss and the best feelings he\u2019s had in his entire life, and then the next his head would be cracked open on the pavement.</p>\n<p>He knew, in that moment, that he had to tell them. He had to say something - his slip-up had already made them suspicious, so if he didn\u2019t tell them, they\u2019d get it from Principal Nedzu or Recovery Girl, probably. He had to tell them, so that they would know what he did to them - ruin their timelines - so they could wash their hands of him. He\u2019d go back to his place as Deku for the rest of his time here in the past, and then he\u2019d be dead.</p>\n<p>It would be easier than being warm and cared for. He didn\u2019t deserve it, anyways.</p>\n<p>So, with shaky legs, he walked out of the guest bedroom to finally talk to them. He\u2019d been there long enough. They needed to know.</p>\n<p>\u201c...See if there\u2019s <em> anything </em> we can do for him after his stay is up,\u201d he heard Shouta\u2019s voice as he padded quietly into the living room. \u201cI wish he could just stay here, go to school with us, but we have to do things the right way for his sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s mouth drew into a fine line and his hands felt cold. They still wanted to do something for him? He didn\u2019t deserve it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t d-do things the \u2018right way.\u2019 Not with my c-circumstances\u2026\u201d he held back the shakes of anxiety threatening to overtake him. \u201cI think\u2026 I think there\u2019s some things I n-need to tell you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Shouta\u2019s simple, one word answer. It held no judgement, no anger, only acceptance. It made Izuku\u2019s heart ache with feelings he couldn\u2019t explain.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you wanna sit down, Izuku?\u201d Hizashi\u2019s voice was soft as he gestured to the couch. So soft, so <em> gentle </em>. Always gentle, but never coddling. Izuku\u2019s eyes fell for just a second before he nodded, curt and quiet. They all sat, with Izuku in the middle. Izuku folded his hands in his lap. He was ready for the anger, the yelling, anything. He was ready to be Deku again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 Y-You both have been so wonderful. More than somebody like me c-could ever ask for. That\u2019s why I have to tell you this, b-because then you\u2019ll understand why I\u2026 I don\u2019t deserve to be called your friend.\u201d Izuku murmured, barely stuttering. He was resigned, ready, there was no reason to be so nervous or scared. He could do this.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, please.\u201d Izuku stopped before Hizashi could protest, \u201cLet me finish. Let me tell you, and then you can yell and scream at me all you want. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe would never do that.\u201d Shouta said, his tone brooking no argument. \u201cBut go ahead. Whatever you have to say, say it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe quirk that hit me, that s-sent me here\u2026 it was a time travel quirk.\u201d And with that first thing said, Shouta and Hizashi\u2019s eyes were wide, and he felt spurred on to continue. \u201cI\u2019m from the future. A long, long time from now\u2026 15 years from now. I\u2026 was hit a-accidentally, and it sent me back in time\u2026 the quirk user said I\u2019d be stuck here for \u2018a month or two,\u2019 and then I\u2019d go r-right back to my own time. Principal Nedzu, he knows\u2026 And he said I couldn\u2019t do much damage to the past unless I was a-actually trying, except for\u2026 For your memories. For <em> you guys </em>. J-Just by being here, I\u2026 I\u2019ve messed with your futures, somehow, some way! I-I don\u2019t know how, but I\u2026 I\u2019ve done something to you! After you\u2019ve shown me n-nothing but kindness I didn\u2019t deserve!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s hands clenched into fists, the pain from his palms barely more than a sting at this point. Maybe he deserved that, though - the pain. It was always what he deserved with Bakugou.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 So that\u2019s why I-I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t say I\u2019m your friend\u2026 B-Because just by existing here, with you, I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d Izuku finished. They knew, now. They knew. They knew he was quirkless, that he was from the future, and that he was to blame for any changes in their futures.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody said you\u2019ve hurt us.\u201d Shouta\u2019s tone was so normal Izuku felt like he\u2019d been given whiplash. \u201cSo what? You\u2019re from the future. You changed our futures by being here, now. Who\u2019s to say it\u2019s a bad future? I could care less. What\u2019s happened has happened, and what will happen, <em> will </em> happen. Whether or not we like it, we can only move forward, no matter what the future holds - all we can do is enjoy the present while we have it. And right now, the time we\u2019ve spent with you hasn\u2019t been bad. You\u2019re our friend, Izuku, time travel or not. Our future selves will just have to deal with it, because that isn\u2019t changing any more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d Hizashi nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t care what\u2019s changed, because whatever changes has to be for the better. How can us knowing you and being friends hurt anything? We care about you a lot, Izuku. That\u2019s got to be worth something in the future, no matter what happens between now and then. Sure, 15 years is a long time. We\u2019ll be adults then, but like Shouta said, so what? You\u2019ll still be our friend, we\u2019ll just be a bit taller than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku felt all the nerve he\u2019d worked up crumble to the ground. He expected\u2026 anything but <em> this </em>. Somehow, this was so much worse and so much better all at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t\u2026 You can\u2019t interact with me at all between now and then. My past self, I mean. Once I go back, that\u2019s it f-for\u2026 for 15 years. If you change anything about my life before I got hit by the quirk\u2026 W-We won\u2019t remember each other. You have to leave me c-completely alone for 15 years\u2026 no matter how much it hurts.\u201d Izuku explained. <em> No matter how much </em> I <em> get hurt </em> was left unsaid in his mind. Hizashi tensed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you mean we have to\u2026 to leave your life the way it was before we met? To just let you be alone again as you grow up?\u201d he said sharply. Izuku nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026 or everything that led me t-to the person who used their quirk on me would n-never have happened.\u201d He said. \u201cMy past would be changed, and we\u2019d never have m-met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we just have to make up for lost time <em> now</em>. We\u2019ll make sure you have the best time you can here. That way, we all know you aren\u2019t alone, because we\u2019ll have made sure you weren\u2019t. We\u2019ll know we did everything we could for the you that ended up with us.\u201d Shouta said, hand reaching for Izuku\u2019s. Hizashi grasped the other, and Izuku felt like he was going to burst.</p>\n<p>He wanted to tell them <em> how </em> and <em> why </em> he ended up being hit by the quirk. He wanted to tell them that he was going to die, but he just couldn\u2019t. Not after hearing them talk like that to him. He was sure that if he told them, then they\u2019d wilt like flowers without water. He couldn\u2019t bear to hurt them like that. He would tell them eventually, but not now.</p>\n<p>Right now, he was grateful, in a morbid sort of way, for everything in his life. If he hadn\u2019t ended up on that roof, Shouta and Hizashi would never have met him. He\u2019d never have felt this human. He\u2019d just be dead. So right now, he held onto his friends\u2019 hands and was simply content to exist as a person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was Izuku Midoriya, <em> not </em> the Deku that Bakugou had always called him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku Midoriya learned, at the age of 15, that he had two friends: Shouta Aizawa and Hizashi Yamada.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hizashi went home that evening to do laundry and pick up some things, and Shouta had taken care of dinner for the evening. He insisted that Izuku get some rest, since telling them everything had taken a lot out of him. The next day went by in a calm blur, and then the next, too - until it was nearly the end of the next week, and almost time for his next checkup with Nedzu.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d promised to make a day of it, again, if Izuku was feeling up for it. He said he\u2019d see, but truth be told Izuku was itching to write. Maybe he\u2019d work up the courage to ask for a journal, while he was here. He thought it might help with the down time, especially, when he wasn\u2019t cooking or cleaning or doing something else around the apartment. He was always doing one thing or another, keeping himself distracted from his own thoughts.</p>\n<p>His favorite time, though, was when he went to bed. He got to hold his friend\u2019s hands, grounded in the fact that he was safe no matter what his nightmares told him. That was another thing he\u2019d have to tell them, eventually. Why he thrashed in his sleep, where his scars were from. He could feel the questions every time their stares lingered on his skin, but they never asked. And surprisingly, their stares were never ones of pity or judgement - Shouta\u2019s stare was fire, fury and indignation that he was ever hurt in the first place. Hizashi\u2019s stare was sunlight, warm like he wanted to tell him that he was cared for despite them.</p>\n<p>Either one made his heart flutter, because he\u2019d never had somebody look at him like that before. Nobody had cared enough to.</p>\n<p>So when he sat in Nedzu\u2019s office again, he was surprised when the first thing out of the chimera's mouth is \u201cWell, don\u2019t you look positively glowing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I\u2026?\u201d Izuku asked, almost shy. Nedzu let out a little laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you do! It\u2019s wonderful to see. I trust the two have been treating you well?\u201d He asked, though there was a very clear undercurrent to the tone. Izuku nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yes. I told them about my situation.\u201d he said, firm and happy in a way that made him warm to think about. Nedzu\u2019s tone dialed down at this, happy that he\u2019d been able to cross that bridge. It was a big one, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd? How did it go? You\u2019re still here, so I assume they haven\u2019t done anything to your own timeline.\u201d Nedzu asked, and Izuku nodded again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey understood. They don\u2019t\u2026 hate me. Th-They called me their friend.\u201d Izuku seemed almost shocked at himself for saying such a thing, but quickly dialed himself in. \u201cThey want me to h-have fun, while I\u2019m here, and I think\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thoughts are ever stupid, Midoriya-san. Only learning opportunities.\u201d Nedzu said, his voice light but commanding. Izuku sighed and shifted in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I just wish I\u2026 Didn\u2019t have to go back. I like it here.\u201d He said, eyes cast downwards with words unspoken. Nedzu\u2019s silence said volumes; he understood what wasn\u2019t said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Midoriya-san. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not a lot that can be done with these types of quirks. They simply have to run their course. But, perhaps when you return to the future, you can look for your friends? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d enjoy your company again.\u201d Nedzu suggested. \u201cAt the very least, I do agree with those two on the sentiment that you should enjoy your time here. There\u2019s nothing that says because you were put in this situation it has to be horrible, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-It\u2019s been anything <em> but </em> horrible!\u201d Izuku blurts out faster than he can think, like Nedzu\u2019s words almost stung him. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so-so nice, you know, a-and I feel like, less useless when I\u2019m with them, a-and I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Midoriya-san, there\u2019s no need to justify yourself. I\u2019m perfectly content knowing you feel welcomed with Aizawa-san and Hizashi-san. Now, I <em> would </em> like to talk about the quirk that sent you here, if that\u2019s alright? It could have several fascinating implications.\u201d Nedzu smiled at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Izuku gave a small smile back. The chimera Principal felt an overwhelming urge to protect.</p>\n<p>Oh, Nedzu would <em> destroy </em>anybody who hurt that smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s get started! First thing\u2019s first, would you describe the exact situation leading up to the quirk being used on you? Even the smallest details are helpful.\u201d Nedzu said, and instantly Izuku clammed up. He wasn\u2019t ready for that yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2026 I\u2019d rather not talk about that, please\u2026\u201d his mouth felt dry with the admission. Nedzu said nothing, but noted it on Izuku\u2019s file.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, what about the instant the quirk was used on you? Can you describe what that experience was like?\u201d Nedzu asked, ready to write.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it was like a bright, white light.\u201d Izuku hummed, remembering in his mind. \u201cKind of warm. L-Like a hug\u2026 sorry, is that weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all. Please go on.\u201d Nedzu only chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well, I went into that light because I\u2026 well, I wasn\u2019t able to go anywhere else. Anyways, after I went through it, it felt like I w-was falling asleep, but I woke up in some kind of dark void. Almost floating...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the appointment with Nedzu went fine - Izuku would even say it was enjoyable, because he got to gush about quirks with the Principal of <em> U.A High </em> of all people, and Izuku thought he might just keel over at the thought. Nedzu was a good person, regardless of the fear he instilled in his students. Izuku was so glad - beyond all measure - that it had been Shouta and Hizashi to find him that day, and that they\u2019d brought him to U.A to be healed.</p>\n<p>He honestly didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d be without them.</p>\n<p>So when they were out, perusing stores again, Izuku had asked as bravely as he could to go into a stationary store. He wanted to write about them so badly he could practically feel the pencil in his hands already. They\u2019d taken him to a local business, one that sold everything Izuku was looking for, and neither Shouta nor Hizashi had seen Izuku so excited before. He was just about shaking with excitement as he looked at all the different things in the store.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, such nice paper! And these pencils look so nice too!\u201d He muttered to himself about paper weights and how they help up and the pros and cons of each pencil. It was kind of endearing to watch, and they had no idea Izuku had enjoyed writing <em> that </em> much or they would\u2019ve taken him sooner. Eventually, Izuku settled on a couple of small, hardbound journals (Shouta insisted he get the nicer ones) and a some pencils with different cartoon designs on them. Hizashi had even picked out a pencil bag for all of his new things.</p>\n<p>Izuku had taken them right back to the apartment with glee and sat down at the table with them, ready to start writing as soon as possible. When he sat and looked at the cover of the journal, however, he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to put. He always, <em> always </em> labelled the books he wrote in, but what would this one be for? It wasn\u2019t going to be a Hero Analysis book (that was going to be one of the other ones)... so then what? He pursed his lips a bit in thought. Then his face lit up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Past &amp; Future Me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would write about his time here in the past, and everything he experienced with his new friends - as well as his plans for\u2026 his hands shook as he realized what he was doing. He was acting like he had a future to go back to. As if he wasn\u2019t going to die\u2026 Just being with his friends made him think about what he had done that much more seriously. He didn\u2019t regret jumping - it led him to his friends, after all - but at the same time\u2026 he was scared. Terrified of going to his death now that he\u2019d experienced something - anything - of what life had to offer.</p>\n<p>He erased the title, writing a new one in its place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> My Time in the Past. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Hizashi was the type of guy who let everything roll off of his back. He was loud, overly aggressive with his affection, and tended to butt his nose into people\u2019s business sometimes, but he always had the best of intentions. He never let anything others said or did get to him, and had a personality to back that up. So, when his first close friend in high school ended up being Shouta Aizawa, not a whole lot of people were surprised. He had the ability to make friends with just about everyone he met, no matter how conflicting the personality.</p>\n<p>When Izuku had shown up, though, and Hizashi had found out about the things that could be done to people - the depravity others could force on a fellow human - he found himself out of his element. For once, something finally bothered him. Something made him <em> mad</em>. He was careful not to show it for Izuku\u2019s sake, of course, but he wanted to know the story behind his scars, his insistence on quirkless people being what it was, and what led him to being so afraid of thunder he subconsciously had nightmares about it. Everything that made Izuku feel like less than a person made Hizashi so unbelievably upset in his place, and he wanted nothing more than to make sure Izuku understood that he had a place at his and Shouta\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>When he found out that Izuku was from the future, though, and he was forced to make sure that he left Izuku\u2019s terrible life the way it was or risk forgetting him? He was beyond mad. He wanted to <em> do </em> something, he wanted to take away the pain somehow, even though Izuku insisted he was doing that just by being there for him.</p>\n<p>He wondered how Shouta felt about the whole situation. Probably about the same, although anger and annoyance were the two emotions Shouta had easier times expressing, so it was probably less concealed than his own.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, though, having Izuku around was like a blessing. He was so quiet and jumpy, but Hizashi was happy to be there for him as much as he could. He found everything Izuku did endearing, from his muttering to his almost obsessive cleaning habits, and <em> especially </em> his beyond amazing cooking skills. Hizashi was excited to learn as many new things as possible about his friend. For example, Izuku loved heroes. He loved All Might, although for some reason he was always a little sad when talking about him. He watched everything around him like a hawk, and would write in his brand new journals at the drop of a hat.</p>\n<p>There were still so many things Hizashi <em> didn\u2019t </em> know, though, and he was determined to find out. So when Shouta said he had to go out for the day to sort through some things with his parents in another prefecture, he saw the perfect opportunity for some Izuku bonding time!</p>\n<p>\"Knock, knock, Izuku-kun! Good morning!\" Hizashi cheered, knocking on the apartment door. He had picked up a few things from his house and was ready to go, and ready to convince Izuku that a day out was just what he needed. They promised to have as much fun as possible while they could, and Hizashi had the perfect idea in mind. The door opened to a very sleepy Izuku in pajamas, yawning as he let him in.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, good morning, Hizashi\u2026 Sorry, 'm still a li'l tired\u2026\" he slurred, rubbing sleep out of his eyes with an extra long pj sleeve.</p>\n<p><em> He is so. Cute. Oh my god! </em> Hizashi thought as he watched Izuku pad around the apartment, picking up what was left of his and Shouta's extra early breakfast mess.</p>\n<p>\"No worries, no worries! I just thought that since Shouta happened to be gone for the day, I'd keep you company! I thought we could go to have lunch later, and I'd show you my favorite arcade! There's a buncha cool ones around town, but there's one that's my favorite.\" Hizashi suggested, and he saw Izuku perk up a bit at the mention of an arcade.</p>\n<p>\"Whoa\u2026 Really? I-I've never been to one before\u2026 are they fun?\" He asked, eyes bright with curiosity. \"They seem r-really fun in the future, I wonder what yours were like.\"</p>\n<p>\"Huh?! You've never been to an arcade?!\" Hizashi gasped playfully. \"We must correct this! C'mon, I'll help clean up, you go ahead and get ready for the day! It'll be fun, promise!\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku was wearing one of his new outfits and had his backpack ready, full of his new journals so he could write about everything he saw. The outfit he picked to wear out with Hizashi was his arm covers under a pastel yellow shirt that had a pocket with red kanji printed on it, plain white cargo shorts and his red sneakers. It was the first time he'd worn shorts since he got there, and though Hizashi didn't say anything, he could see that Izuku's legs were almost as bad as his arms in sheer amount of scars.</p>\n<p>Izuku didn't seem to mind his legs too much though, more focused on the bright lights and colors of the arcade Hizashi had taken him to. It was out of the way, without crowds, and a lot of the machines were hero themed. He seemed to enjoy it, all the new experiences, and Hizashi was glad to be a part of them. Izuku walked from machine to machine, eyeing the different ones and observing the other few players curiously. He was watching carefully, as if seeing all the potential pros and cons of a game, whether or not it was worth it. He watched them as if they were individual battles, like a hero versus a villain, and Hizashi was <em> fascinated </em> by that.</p>\n<p>\"Anything interesting you? Wanna play anything?\" He asked, smiling widely. Izuku murmured something to himself as he watched somebody stop playing a replica of an older, vintage arcade game, and nodded finally.</p>\n<p>\"This one, if you think about the win/loss ratios and the way it's played\u2026\" Izuku began to ramble about the various technicalities. Hizashi had no idea what he was talking about, but Izuku was enthusiastic, so that was all that mattered. He dropped a few tokens in the slot of the machine and gestured to it.</p>\n<p>\"Go for it! I wanna see you kick this game's butt!\" Hizashi cheered, a fist in the air. Izuku laughed and approached the machine, taking just a moment to figure out the controls in his hands. Once he was situated, he dove right in, immediately entranced by the game.</p>\n<p>Hizashi watched with interest as Izuku picked up the game rather quickly. He became invested in watching every movement, every flick of a joystick and press of a button on the cabinet. He watched Izuku's eyebrows furrow in concentration, his tongue just barely stuck out of his mouth as he went at the game with every bit of ferocity as an <em> actual </em> fight. Despite his shy and self-deprecating nature, he was incredibly intense with everything he did. From his cleaning to his cooking to his gaming, there wasn't a single challenge that Izuku didn't take seriously.</p>\n<p>\"Ah! A powerup!\" Izuku said happily, and Hizashi glanced down at the game to see that he was already several levels in. Had he really spent that long just watching Izuku? Not to mention, he was <em> really </em> good at the game, too - he hadn't lost a single life and was racking up points left and right. He was going to overtake the high score soon, and with minimal effort, it seemed. Hizashi's eyebrows rose watching his score climb higher and higher.</p>\n<p>\"You sure you\u2019ve never been to an arcade before, Izuku? Or even played this game? You're really good at it!\" He said, leaning over Izuku's shoulder and resting his chin on it. Izuku nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Mhm! Never. There's patterns in everything, if you just watch for a while you can pick up anything's strengths and weaknesses after all.\" Izuku said casually.</p>\n<p>\"Huh! Well, you learn something new every day. Didn't know you could apply that to arcade games. Is that what you write in that Hero Analysis notebook you made?\" Hizashi wondered. Izuku didn't even think about it as he answered, too focused on his game to worry about how he used to be made fun of for those notes.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I like watching Heroes fight and writing about their quirks and what uses they might have\u2026 all sorts of things\u2026\" he mashed a button furiously to make his character do something. Hizashi made a thoughtful sort of noise, thinking about what sort of applications it could have.</p>\n<p>\"You think you could do an analysis on my own quirk?\" Hizashi asked, and Izuku froze up for a moment at the question. His character lost his first life, and Izuku turned red.</p>\n<p>\"Umm\u2026 W-Well, nobody's ever really asked if I could do a p-personal one before, but I\u2026 Suppose I could? M-Maybe we could talk about your quirk when we get lunch?\" Izuku suggested shyly, focusing back on the game. Hizashi nodded, hugging his arms around Izuku's waist. The shorter teen let out an 'eep!' in surprise.</p>\n<p>\"That would be so cool! It's always good to get input from other people besides my teachers. Thanks, Izuku!\" Hizashi grinned. Izuku nodded furiously, trying to hide his face from his friend. Hizashi stayed like this for a while, watching Izuku play the game. Eventually, he finally lost all of the lives, and had beaten the high score three times over.</p>\n<p>\u201cHizashi, look! Look, I beat the high score!\u201d He grinned proudly, and Hizashi felt his heart beat just a little faster.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Izuku was proud of something. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat job! You did awesome! I\u2019ve never seen somebody who\u2019s such a natural at video games like you are!\u201d Hizashi praised him, picking him up and spinning him playfully. Izuku laughed, carefree and so genuinely happy.</p>\n<p>Hizashi wished he laughed like that all the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was so much fun! Can we try something else? Maybe a crane game?\u201d Izuku\u2019s expression sparkled with that curiosity Hizashi had seen that morning, and Hizashi nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, totally! I saw a really cool one over here. Do you think you could analyze this machine too? Does it work like that?\u201d Hizashi asked, wondering how Izuku went about his process of thinking through things. The green haired teen grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! I-I could show you if you want, since I\u2019ve played some crane games before\u2026 if it\u2019s not, like, a-annoying or anything\u2026\u201d He said softly, and Hizashi dragged him to the machine he\u2019d pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s never annoying, I think it\u2019s really cool how fast you think through stuff! Honestly, I could probably learn a thing or two from you. Do you go to the U.A hero course in your time, too?\u201d Hizashi asked, and Izuku looked into the glass of the crane game a little saddened. It was the same sort of expression he had whenever he talked about All Might.</p>\n<p>\u201c... No, I don\u2019t\u2026 I w-wouldn\u2019t ever be able to get in. I\u2019m quirkless, like I said, so\u2026\u201d he said, almost resigned. \u201cB-But that\u2019s okay! I\u2019ll just, you know, apply myself to something else. Maybe cooking? You guys seem to think my cooking is pretty great!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good! You totally could be a chef if you wanted! But your mind is just as good, and I think you could at least get into the general course! There\u2019s no rule that says you have to have a quirk to get in anymore. They did away with that rule a while back, after all.\u201d Hizashi pointed out. \u201cBut don\u2019t overthink it. Whatever you wanna do should be your first choice! Just go with your gut and you\u2019ll be fine! Anyways, tell me how you\u2019d tackle this baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-Oh, right!\u201d Izuku\u2019s mood got right back up, dedicating his thoughts to the crane in front of him. \u201cSo, the first thing you\u2019d wanna look at is the way the items are positioned! If they\u2019re all, y\u2019know, buried, then there\u2019s no point in going for any of them. S-So look here, there\u2019s one that\u2019s unburied there, in the corner.\u201d</p>\n<p>True to form, there was a small, stuffed rabbit sitting in the corner, all of its limbs unburied, including its ears. It was a cream color, with a tiny red bow tie on the front. Hizashi nodded eagerly, waiting to hear more about how to master the way of the crane game.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, now we\u2019ve got our target\u2026 Next, w-we should asses the claw itself. Is the grip any good? Does it spin when it goes down?\u201d Izuku said, sticking a few coins in the slot. He positioned the claw over the rabbit, though it didn\u2019t fully pick it up the first time. \u201cWell, that\u2019s okay, so now we know it has a decent enough grip to grab a toy that size. It doesn\u2019t spin, s-so we don\u2019t have to worry bout that factor. The best place to get a grip would be\u2026. The head, since that\u2019s the most exposed and grippable part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, I had no idea so much went into winning at crane games!\u201d Hizashi gushed, and Izuku smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-It\u2019s not too much, right? L-Let me know if I\u2019m going overboard.\u201d He insisted.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, you\u2019re all good! Keep going, keep going!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so next you\u2019ve just gotta position it right. Y-You can always move around the machine, so don\u2019t forget to look at the \u2018target\u2019 from all angles, that way you know if you\u2019ve got the claw just right over it.\u201d Izuku made his concentrated face as he moved the crane again, occasionally stepping around to look at the rabbit through another side of the machine. Once he had it just where he wanted it, he released the claw, and it picked up the rabbit with ease, dropping it right into the prize chute.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was so cool!\u201d Hizashi beamed, and Izuku grabbed the rabbit, handing it to his friend. \u201cHuh? For me? Why don\u2019t you keep it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, um\u2026 I\u2019m going back to the future eventually, so maybe\u2026 Something to keep from me?\u201d Izuku muttered, entire face red. Hizashi took the rabbit gently in his hands. Looking at it, he wondered just how nice somebody could be! Especially considering everything he\u2019d been through, Hizashi had no idea how Izuku ended up so sweet.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you! In return, let\u2019s go do something really cool. That way we both have something! C\u2019mon, I\u2019ll show you!\u201d Hizashi took Izuku\u2019s hand, leading him to the other side of the arcade, where a giant booth with a curtain on the side sat. \u201cIt\u2019s a picture booth! Let\u2019s get some, and we\u2019ll both keep them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve n-never done a picture booth e-either\u2026 You want to do one with m-me?\u201d Izuku asked, almost surprised. Hizashi nodded firmly, and they both went inside. He put in some cash, and they got ready to take pictures together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\u2026 Click! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They took several pictures, some with normal faces, and some with Hizashi being\u2026 well, Hizashi. They even had one with the rabbit in the picture, and when they were done, they stepped out to get the finished product. Izuku looked at the strip of pictures, eyes wide as he clutched it to his chest protectively. He looked like Hizashi had just hung the moon and stars in the sky for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cM-My first picture with a f-friend\u2026\u201d He whispered breathlessly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hizashi would do anything to put that sort of look on Izuku\u2019s face again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After playing for a while more at the arcade, the two decided it was time to get lunch, so they found a small, American-themed cafe and tucked themselves away in a corner table. Izuku spread out his notebooks on the table as they munched on fries, and Hizashi looked at them curiously. He wondered what could be inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is just what I\u2019ve observed while I\u2019ve been here, so it\u2019s not n-nearly as complete as the notes I have at home, but I\u2019m happy to write down some basic ideas for your quirk and show you my thought process!\u201d Izuku smiled, and pushed a book labelled \u201cPast Hero Analysis #1\u201d towards Hizashi. The blond teen opened it, surprised at just how perfect yet crammed the handwriting was. He was able to fit so much on a single page, and since he\u2019d gotten the journals he\u2019d filled up nearly half of one. It was full of notes on the Heroes he\u2019d seen on TV while at Shouta\u2019s apartment, with observations about their quirks, specialty moves, potential uses and ideas for improvements on the functionality of the quirk either through training or support items.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you get all of this\u2026 just from the clips they show on TV?\u201d Hizashi asked, eyebrows raised. \u201cThis is a <em> lot</em>! This is, like, even better than some of my teacher\u2019s observations, dude! I think you should seriously think about the Gen Ed course at U.A with skills like these, you know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 really, I can\u2019t.\u201d Izuku said, that forlorn look returning to his face. \u201cI know I can\u2019t, and it\u2019s not just m-me beating myself up or anything, r-really. I was\u2026 Somebody told me\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTold you what? That you couldn\u2019t get into U.A?\u201d Hizashi snorted. \u201cWhoever told you that must be a real idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...\u201d Izuku was silent, pursing his lips for a moment before he spoke again. \u201cActually, I\u2026 When I was 14 I had my life saved by All Might. I asked him\u2026 if I could be a hero. H-He said I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t be a hero without a quirk. That I was being u-unrealistic. It hurt\u2026 a lot\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t anything that h-hadn\u2019t been said before. Th-That\u2019s how I know I couldn\u2019t get in to U.A. Even All Might said\u2026 i-it was impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then, All Might\u2019s an idiot.\u201d Hizashi shrugged, shoving another fry into his mouth. \u201cSimple as that. Guy may be a hero, the Symbol of Peace and all that, but he\u2019s an idiot if he thinks <em> you </em> can\u2019t be a hero. More muscle than brain or something. With your quirk analysis skills, you\u2019d be just like Shouta. Able to take advantage of a villain's different weaknesses, fight on an even playing field. You could be a hero if you want\u2026 ed\u2026 are you crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi trailed off to see Izuku break down in tears, and he scrambled to figure out what the heck he\u2019d said to upset him so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cS-Sorry, I\u2026!\u201d Izuku cried and pressed his palms to his eyes. \u201cI just\u2026 N-Nobody\u2019s ever said I\u2026 I could be a H-Hero before\u2026!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019m glad I could be the first! Izuku, if you wanted, you could <em> definitely </em> be a Hero. Anybody who says otherwise is just plain blind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta couldn\u2019t help but give the smallest smile as he listened to Izuku gush about his day at the arcade with Hizashi. It was kind of adorable, though he\u2019d never say that out loud lest he risk Hizashi\u2019s teasing for the rest of his life. He appreciated Hizashi not leaving Izuku alone while he was gone, though - they\u2019d only left Izuku alone a handful of times, and it seemed to set the green haired teen completely on edge.</p>\n<p>Shouta was a quiet person by nature, though, and enjoyed the silence of his apartment. Surprisingly, it didn\u2019t change much, even with Izuku there. He was quiet, too - although in a different sort of way, like he was subconsciously going out of his way to make as little noise as possible. On the days they spent at home, Izuku would set the TV to the lowest volume and watch the Hero News channels, scribbling away in his notebooks. Hizashi had mentioned that Izuku\u2019s analytic skills were incredible, and honestly, Shouta believed it.</p>\n<p>There was nothing in his surroundings that Izuku didn\u2019t take in. He was acutely aware of everything going on around him at any given time, aside from the few moments of nightmares or panic attacks. And somehow, throughout everything, he still had this overwhelming insistence that he was inferior because he was quirkless. Honestly, if Shouta didn\u2019t know any better, he would have assumed he was already an intern with a Hero agency despite being so young. He didn\u2019t understand how Izuku had such an inferiority complex. The only real, solid piece of Izuku\u2019s past he knew was that somebody - another person - had put those scars on Izuku\u2019s body, and that according to Izuku, there wasn\u2019t a single person in his life who had believed in him.</p>\n<p>That fact alone made Shouta\u2019s blood boil. How could everyone - <em> everyone! </em> - just abandon Izuku like that? Not one single person had seen Izuku\u2019s worth and talent before him and Hizashi and Nedzu? He wanted to know more about Izuku\u2019s past. Who had wronged him, what had happened. He wanted the story behind each and every single scar, so he could personally tell his friend that what happened was wrong each time. So that Izuku himself would understand that what happened <em> shouldn\u2019t </em> have, that he didn\u2019t <em> deserve </em> something so sickening. He wanted to hold his hands and run his fingers over the scars and tell them he was fine just the way he was. That he was wonderful and worth everything he could give, that he was a human and that he mattered too.</p>\n<p>Shouta just really, really, wanted to care for Izuku. Was that weird? He wasn\u2019t sure.</p>\n<p>So when Izuku had mentioned that Hizashi thought he could become a hero, he saw the perfect opportunity for him to do something good for Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want, Izuku, I could teach you some basic self defense. It\u2019s nothing special, but it could get you on the road to Hero work. You could join the Gen Ed course of U.A, and then transfer into the Hero course using the Sports Festival. I managed to do decently just by myself, but if you work really hard and use your analysis skills, I think you\u2019d have a solid shot at getting in the top 3. Then you could easily appeal for a transfer.\u201d Shouta had explained. It was their third week at the apartment, and he knew his time with Izuku was getting shorter. He didn\u2019t know what Izuku was going to return to in the future, but judging by the scars, he could almost guess. Shouta wanted something important to stay with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cY-You, I\u2026\u201d Izuku spluttered, confused and surprised. He had been so focused on writing that it came as a complete blindside when Shouta responded to him. He had just been casually mentioning things about the day with Hizashi, not expecting that sort of response. \u201cYou think that\u2019s\u2026 p-possible? That I could learn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. I basically do most of my Hero training as hand-to-hand combat, anyways. I don\u2019t really have a quirk suited to beat people up, after all.\u201d Shouta joked, and Izuku had a look of recognition in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, I guess.\u201d Izuku smiled weakly. \u201cI think it might be a bit late, though\u2026 Wh-Where I\u2019m from, the time I left, U.A had already sent out its admissions letters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen get Principal Nedzu to make an exception. If he\u2019s still the Principal in your time, he\u2019ll remember you now, won\u2019t he? Just ask him to take the test late or something. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve made an impression on him already.\u201d Shouta shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of options available for you, even if it isn\u2019t U.A, but I have a feeling that rat man would want you in his school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t think he\u2019s a rat\u2026\u201d Izuku laughed a little, but nodded. \u201cI see your point, though. I-I\u2019ll consider it, I suppose. Would you really not mind teaching me self defense, though\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, not at all. I have a feeling it would be more interesting than sparring with some of my classmates, anyways. Gotta keep up the strength over summer break, so it\u2019s good for me too.\u201d Shouta reassured him. \u201cSo, you just pick the day, and I\u2019ll take you to a place Hizashi and I train at sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku had decided to take Shouta\u2019s offer the very next day, and he found himself at an old park, far out of the way from where many people travelled. It was quiet and peaceful, and the cool breeze made it a nice temperature for physical activity.</p>\n<p>\u201cHizashi showed me this park,\u201d Shouta explained, \u201cHe said it was good for practicing his quirk in small amounts, though he can\u2019t really go all-out since there\u2019s still people. When it\u2019s empty he can be a bit louder, though. We train here on the weekends, sometimes. One time I even managed to tie Hizashi to a lamp post upside down with my capture weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Hizashi was very appreciative!\u201d Izuku giggled at the thought. Shouta shook his head with a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, and he swears he\u2019s going to get back at me one day by somehow making me lick a lamp post in winter. No idea how he plans to pull that off, though.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cAnyways, let\u2019s start with what you <em> do </em>know. Have you been taught anything about self-defense before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Izuku said, adjusting his shirt. He was wearing loose-fitting clothes, good for working out in. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve seen some stuff on TV that Heroes advertise, like, \u2018the more you know\u2019 type things\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that stuff. Yeah, that\u2019s not very helpful. I\u2019ll show you some things. First, we\u2019ll just start off with stuff you can use if you\u2019re ever attacked. Not advanced fighting techniques or anything, I don\u2019t know all the rules of combat, but at least stuff you can use to keep from getting mugged or whatever the situation calls for.\u201d Shouta explained. Izuku nodded, determination filling his eyes. Shouta had never seen that sort of look on his face before, and he was almost proud to know that his help was putting it there.</p>\n<p>\u201cR-Right. I can do this.\u201d Izuku said softly, more to himself than anything else. Shouta nodded back and gestured to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst things first, know the body. Setting quirks aside, the main weak points on the human body are the eyes, nose, neck, knee, and groin. If you can, don\u2019t be afraid to hit those as hard as you can. Do whatever you need to to keep yourself safe, even if it\u2019s considered \u2018dirty fighting.\u2019 Your safety and the safety of those you might have to protect in a given situation is more important than your honor or the civility of a fight. You can bite, scratch, throw dirt in their eyes, whatever you need to do to keep yourself safe, okay?\u201d Shouta explained. Izuku nodded, intently absorbing the information he was learning.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext,\u201d Shouta continued, \u201care the body parts <em> you </em> want to use. Use your elbows, knees or head. People often think of punches or kicks, but those can go wrong if you\u2019re not sure about what you\u2019re doing. There <em> is </em> a wrong way to throw punches, which will only hurt you. You can also use items around you if you have to, like I said with the dirt in the eyes. Use a bag, chair, anything you can get your hands on if you feel like it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I end up, like, r-really hurting somebody?\u201d Izuku asked, a concerned expression now on his face. Shouta shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s self-defense. You\u2019re not actively going after people, you\u2019re protecting yourself from attacks. It\u2019s different, and you can\u2019t get in trouble for it so long as you don\u2019t go completely overboard. Hell, you could probably gouge somebody\u2019s eyes out and still be in the clear if the situation called for it - but once you feel like the threat is clear, you can\u2019t keep going. That\u2019s when you hit \u2018overboard.\u2019 So for example, you hit somebody over the head and knock them out to get away? Don\u2019t keep bashing their head in. Simple.\u201d Shouta shrugged. Izuku paled a little bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 well, I get it, i-it\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I just feel like I would get in trouble no matter how little force I actually used\u2026\u201d Izuku explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you did, any police officer who arrested you would be in the wrong if it was self-defense. Like I said, you\u2019re not going after people, and you\u2019re not killing them, you\u2019re only protecting yourself here.\u201d Shouta insisted, and Izuku seemed to accept it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, as far as some actual basic moves go\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta and Izuku spent nearly the rest of the day practicing things, including how to get out of basic holds or positions and basic moves to fight back with. Izuku was still shaky with them, but Shouta was patient and never wavered. By the time they were done, Izuku was exhausted and drenched in sweat, but looking better than he had in a while. He seemed actively less skittish, just from the one lesson, and Shouta was happy with those results.</p>\n<p>\u201cTh-Thank you!\u201d Izuku panted, hands on his knees for support. \u201cThis was\u2026 really fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFun?\u201d Shouta asked curiously, dabbing at the sweat on his brow with the neck of his shirt. Izuku nodded firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! F-Fun! Anything I get to do with you and Hizashi is really fun\u2026 And you guys aren\u2019t, like, afraid of me\u2026 O-Or treat me like a baby.\u201d He said, mumbling the last part. \u201cA-A lot of people I know, i-if they didn\u2019t hate me for being quirkless, I was still\u2026 u-useless to them. I couldn\u2019t d-do anything myself, I was like a g-glass doll.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d Shouta said plainly. \u201cI mean, most quirks aren\u2019t built for taking punches or stuff like that anyways, so I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d treat you any different\u2026 Just another thing I don\u2019t understand, I guess. You talk about your life in the future sometimes, and I just don\u2019t get it, you know? I don\u2019t get how people can fall so far in just 15 years. Kids are mean, sure, but I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t imagine people being as cruel to somebody as people have been to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCruel\u2026?\u201d Izuku tilted his head. \u201c... I guess so\u2026 it\u2019s hard to see it as cruel\u2026 It\u2019s always been m-my fault. Just\u2026 getting what I deserve for being quirkless, I-I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s tone had been so soft and normal it was hard to even process what he said for a second. Shouta\u2019s fury bubbled to the surface for just a second again, and he stared at Izuku with a look of pure indignation.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Your fault </em> ? Getting what you <em> deserve </em> ? Izuku, I don\u2019t know the story behind your scars, but that night you had the nightmare, you said that somebody had put them there. If you think you <em> deserve </em> that treatment, then you are sorely mistaken. Nobody deserves that, Izuku. <em> Nobody </em>.\u201d Shouta stewed in his own anger for a minute, before realizing that Izuku had froze on the spot. Oh god, Shouta knew he made a mistake. Talking about the scars was a big no-no.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I said\u2026 I said that?!\u201d Izuku\u2019s breathing picked up. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t\u2026 He wasn\u2019t\u2026 it was a-accidents\u2026! B-Because I\u2026 I\u2019m quirkless, I can\u2019t h-help it, I get hurt e-easily! I-I swear, it\u2026!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t talk about it any more, okay? It\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t worry about it. I won\u2019t pretend you could possibly get all of those scars from accidents, but I won\u2019t bring it up. I know you don\u2019t like talking about it.\u201d Shouta reassured him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-If I talk about it\u2026\u201d Izuku sniffled, willing away the tears in his eyes, \u201cHe\u2019ll get really m-mad\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, we\u2019re 15 years in your past, whoever did this can\u2019t hurt you. If you feel up for talking about it, we\u2019ll always listen. We couldn\u2019t do much anyways, remember? Your timeline and all that?\u201d Shouta said, barely managing to keep a lid on his anger. He basically just got some kind of confirmation that somebody was hurting Izuku, and he wanted to <em> do </em> something about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cH-He can\u2019t\u2026 he can\u2019t find out here\u2026\u201d Izuku whispered, like he\u2019d just unlocked a secret he\u2019d been looking for. His face went from troubled to shocked, and he stared at Shouta for a moment before continuing. \u201cY-You would\u2026 want to know about my s-scars?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Shouta replied immediately, moving to Izuku\u2019s side. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m teaching you some self defense, so you won\u2019t get any more of them. The last thing I want is for you to get hurt, but sometimes hurt can be mental too. Talking about it helps, but only if you\u2019re willing. Hizashi too, he\u2019s just as worried about your safety as I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 I-It hurts, the scars, but e-everyone always says it\u2019s m-my fault\u2026! I want to t-tell people, but nobody ever b-believes me\u2026\u201d Izuku curled into Shouta\u2019s side as the black-haired teen wrapped an arm around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe you, Izuku. You can tell us as much or as little as you want.\u201d He said, guiding him out of the park. It was getting late, and the sun was sinking over the treeline, making everything bathed in an orange hue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to\u2026 to talk about it. M-Maybe not right now, but later?\u201d Izuku asked, eyes peeking out from the curtain of curly green hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny time you want, Izuku. Not a moment before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the evening with Shouta was spent with greasy take-out and Hero observations, and Izuku couldn\u2019t have been happier. He felt on top of the world, he felt believed in, he felt <em> comfortable</em>. He felt <em> wanted</em>. It was all he could\u2019ve asked for, and then some.</p>\n<p>He enjoyed Hizashi\u2019s loud and happy demeanor, but he also really enjoyed the quiet, in-between moments with Shouta, where he felt natural and at home. He was so used to the silence of his own home that the sort of background noise of Shouta\u2019s apartment was almost comforting. It wasn\u2019t silent any more, just quiet, comfortable in the presence of each other. This was the sort of life he wished he could\u2019ve had with his mother, before she shut herself off.</p>\n<p>Time spent with Shouta was peaceful, and the few times he did get mad, Izuku could always feel that it was never like Bakugou\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t explosive, it wasn\u2019t directed at him, and it never, ever hurt - Shouta\u2019s anger was <em> for </em> him, in <em> defense </em> of him. It was a new feeling, somebody being angry on his behalf - but it made him feel cared for and protected in a strange sort of way.</p>\n<p>As he sat in front of the TV, muscles sore and mouth full of food, Izuku knew he couldn\u2019t go back to his old life like this. He wanted to stay where he was wanted, where he was comfortable, and cared for - and it scared him. He knew what it meant, the ache for a better life, for <em> any </em> life - and he knew what that ache would lead to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku didn\u2019t want to die.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t want to die, and he\u2019d have to tell them he was going to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku only prayed they\u2019d remember him. It was his only chance, and he was going to be brave and selfish and a little reckless and <em> take </em> it, because Shouta and Hizashi made him feel like he could. They made him feel like he had a place in life, that he could ask for things and not have his requests shoved back down his throat with a nitroglycerin-covered fist.</p>\n<p>\u201cH-Hey, Shouta? Tomorrow, when Hizashi gets back, I\u2026 I want to tell you guys something. Is that okay? I-It\u2019s important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>15 Years in the Future</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Shouta!\u201d A cheery voice called. Shouta picked his head up from his desk, sleep in his eyes, and looked over to the owner of said voice. It was his coworker, Nemuri, aka Midnight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? What do you want?\u201d He asked, still fresh from his nap and grumpy as ever. Nemuri paid no mind and draped herself over his shoulders, eying his desk. Her eyes stopped on a small, framed picture with a date carved into the frame.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I <em> was </em> gonna ask you about a student, but now I\u2019m <em> much </em> more curious about this!\u201d She pointed to the the photograph. There were two teens in the photo, in what looked like an old photo booth picture. She recognized one as Hizashi from when they were younger, but the other teen was a mystery to her. \u201cWho\u2019s this? And what\u2019s with this date? Isn\u2019t that like next week?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d Shouta placed the picture face-down with a grumble. Nemuri pouted and made a whiny sort of noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon! You can tell me! Childhood friend or something? You only ever talk about Hizashi being your friend at U.A when we went, I wanna know the juicy secrets!\u201d She pleaded, using her best puppy eyes on him. Shouta only rolled his in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you really have to know, the date is a promise I made to somebody a long time ago. Now can you please leave me alone? I was trying to nap.\u201d He sighed, laying his head back down on the desk. Nemuri\u2019s face scrunched in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cA promise? I don\u2019t get it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>15 Years in the Past</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku knows he needs to tell them. He wants to tell them. But it\u2019s so terrifying, to bare your soul with the possibility of having it smashed against concrete if they didn\u2019t believe or remember him. Well, Izuku supposed they\u2019d believe him - Shouta had insisted they would. But remembering for 15 years was an entirely different matter. It wasn\u2019t going to stop him, though - he was going to say it, and risk the chance. He was going to tell them, and if they saved him, he\u2019d prove to everyone who had ever beat him down that he had friends. He was a person. He could be a Hero.</p>\n<p>Still, it was terrifying.</p>\n<p>His hands shook and his scars ached with phantom pains of lessons burned into the skin. Every time he\u2019d been told \u2018no\u2019 was written like a story on his body, and it was hard to forget. But glaringly, above all of the reminders of his place in the world, were the two people who had told him he could be more. That he already was more, simply by existing. The words of his two friends were worth more than the scars on his skin, so he\u2019d risk everything for them.</p>\n<p>Izuku could do this. He already told them he was from the future, about changing their timelines irrevocably, and not once had they reacted the way he thought. He just had to trust them. He could trust them, they believed in him, they were heroes in the future! He could tell them.</p>\n<p>Still, he was terrified.</p>\n<p>His hands wouldn\u2019t stop shaking even as he cooked breakfast, and he felt the all too familiar anxiety bubble up in his chest as they ate. When they were done, he planned to sit down and tell them <em> everything</em>. Everything that others had ignored his entire life, that he had gotten blamed for, that he had marred onto his body - he was going to say it all. And he hoped beyond hope that they would still remember him in the future.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Izuku, what did you want to talk about?\u201d Hizashi asked, expression one of gentle worry. They\u2019d finished breakfast and did the dishes, and it was finally time. He took a deep breath and then took Hizashi and Shouta\u2019s hands in his own, and they all sat around the coffee table where Izuku liked to take his notes. He didn\u2019t let go for a second, sacred that if he let go, he might just lose all the nerves he\u2019d built up for this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I want to tell you something very important. It\u2019s a bit long and I might ramble a little, b-but I hope you both are okay with listening\u2026\u201d He said softly. Shouta and Hizashi both nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019re always here to listen, Izuku.\u201d Shouta assured, and Izuku nodded back.</p>\n<p>\u201cR-Right. So, I guess, um, where to start\u2026 I had a friend, when I was little. I called him K\u2026 Kacchan. I don\u2019t call him that any more.\u201d Izuku started, scars already aching at the thought of his childhood. \u201cHe and I would always play Heroes together\u2026 and then when we were four, he got his\u2026 q-quirk. He got a really, really strong one. I\u2026 didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t w-want to play with me after that. Instead, he just said I was, you know, q-quirkless. Useless\u2026 Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta\u2019s grip on his hand became a little tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen m-my dad left, and my mom got really, really quiet. S-She hasn\u2019t really\u2026 talked to me properly in years. She just goes to work and comes home and leaves me money for g-groceries and such\u2026 I had to learn to do everything myself. Cooking, cleaning, e-everything. I\u2019m so used to it that it\u2019s a-almost uncomfortable not to.\u201d He admitted shyly, and suddenly his need to cook and clean became apparent. He hadn\u2019t known any other way but his own. \u201cI\u2019ve basically been taking care of m-myself since I was, um, six or seven, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi\u2019s grip tightened next.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that was o-okay, I suppose\u2026 I don\u2019t mind that so much. B-But Kacchan\u2026\u201d the nickname left a bitter taste in his mouth, and Izuku frowned. \u201cBakugou\u2026 He\u2026 He used everything against me. N-No matter what I did, it wasn\u2019t\u2026 good enough. Wasn\u2019t right. I was always D-Deku to him. I just wanted to see him happy, we used to be f-friends, you know? I wanted him to succeed at being a Hero. But h-he never saw it that way. He thought I was m-mocking him. Eventually it j-just wasn\u2019t enough I guess\u2026 And he saw the only way I could be useful\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku felt the tears burning in his eyes, but he was determined to finish this without crying.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he told me to let him p-practice his quirk on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d Hizashi almost wasn\u2019t heard, and his face was pale as he realized where it was going. He almost didn\u2019t want to know, but he was going to let Izuku say as much as he wanted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him no,\u201d Izuku continued, his own voice quiet and choked. \u201cI told him no. That was\u2026 a-a mistake. He h-hates being told no. So he did it anyways, and it hurt\u2026 it burned so much\u2026 and he just kept doing it\u2026! E-Even his friends j-joined in, and before I was even 10, everybody in school just\u2026 decided to test quirks out on me b-because I couldn\u2019t fight back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku\u2026\u201d Shouta croaked, his own voice raw with emotion. For the first time in a long while, he genuinely felt like he might cry.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe teachers\u2026 m-my mom\u2026 everyone said it was b-because I was quirkless and got into a-accidents or that I was a-asking for it\u2026 N-Nobody believed me\u2026 I tried to tell somebody once, and th-that\u2026 That made Bakugou so\u2026 so mad\u2026 he just\u2026\u201d With shaky hands, Izuku let go of his friends and reached for his shirt. He took another deep breath. He could do this. He lifted up the hem of his shirt to reveal something that made Shouta and Hizashi sick to their stomachs.</p>\n<p>On his chest, just over where his heart would be, was a gnarled, red scar in the shape a of a handprint. Spreading outwards from the hand were burn scars like a firework, so large it took up nearly half of his shoulder and reached down to his ribs. Around it were other starburst scars and mottled mixes of skin that were clearly home-healed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2026 That was what happened b-because I tried to tell somebody\u2026 A-And even in the hospital\u2026 it was my fault\u2026! So I just\u2026 took it. Because u-until you guys, nobody had ever cared\u2026 o-or believed me\u2026 And I was so tired\u2026 so sick of being hurt, of being useless, of everybody t-telling me I could never be what I w-wanted\u2026 Even All Might told me I couldn\u2019t be a Hero\u2026 that I sh-should be realistic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku lowered his shirt back down, hands still trembling as they found their places with Shouta and Hizashi\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cS-So finally, just before I wound up hit by that quirk\u2026 Bakugou got his acceptance letter to U.A\u2026 and h-he came over to rub it in, I g-guess\u2026 He showed it to me and said that if I\u2026 If I wanted a quirk, I should\u2026 \u2018t-take a swan dive off of the roof and pray for a quirk in my n-next life.\u2019\u201d Izuku couldn\u2019t held it in any more, and finally a strangled sob wrenched itself from his throat. Tears spilled down his face as he pushed on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI c-couldn\u2019t take it any more! I was so tired of e-everything so I\u2026 I listened to him\u2026! I went to the roof of my school and I\u2026 I jumped!\u201d he cried, and Hizashi lurched forward to grab him in a hug. Both he and Shouta were crying now, too. \u201cI thought I was going to die, that it would just be o-over, and I could just b-be at peace\u2026 but somebody\u2026 somebody saw me, somebody with a t-time travel quirk\u2026 they hit me with it while I was falling\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku!\u201d Hizashi gripped his shirt tightly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you were hit by that quirk! You didn\u2019t deserve any of that! None of it was your fault!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only because of you guys that I can say\u2026 I-I don\u2019t want to die any more!\u201d Izuku sobbed, and Shouta found himself being dragged into the hug as well. \u201cBut the quirk is going to send me back when my time here is f-finished, and it will put me r-right back where I left off falling\u2026 s-so please, Shouta, Hizashi, I want to be selfish and ask for your help\u2026 in 15 years, please save my life! Please, please, don\u2019t let me die, please don\u2019t forget me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to ask, Izuku, of course we will.\u201d Shouta pressed his forehead against Izuku\u2019s, tears in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you told us. I don\u2019t know what we would\u2019ve done if\u2026 if you hadn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there, no matter how long it takes! I promise you, we won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d Hizashi swore, clutching onto Izuku\u2019s hand and shirt like it was a lifeline.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise too, Izuku, no matter the time between now and then, we\u2019ll catch you. I promise I won\u2019t forget.\u201d Shouta murmured, tears now streaking his face. He pressed a trembling kiss to the top of Izuku\u2019s head, and all Izuku could do was cry.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d told them, and they promised.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Telling Nedzu was an entirely different matter. After they\u2019d all calmed down, Shouta had suggested telling Nedzu so that they could set up a sort of plan for both catching Izuku and helping him work towards his dreams. Hizashi had insisted he show Nedzu his analysis notebooks, because apparently the Principal would find his abilities fascinating, too. Izuku wasn\u2019t so sure about that part, but he would trust Hizashi\u2019s advice and show him anyways.</p>\n<p>So for his third meeting with Nedzu, he\u2019d gathered up his notebooks and materials, and was ready for his checkup. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to recount the story again - the first time was exhausting enough - so Shouta and Hizashi offered to do it for him. He accepted with relief. He definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to sit through another retelling.</p>\n<p>Nedzu listened to each and every word carefully, his expression darkening as it went on. He couldn\u2019t believe the level of negligence, abuse and neglect Izuku had suffered throughout his life. How could the system fail so <em> spectacularly </em>? To just ignore and even participate in the life Izuku had suffered through? He\u2019d spend the next 15 years preparing to tear down Aldera Jr. High and everyone who had laid a hand on Izuku.</p>\n<p>When Izuku told him about the notebooks, however, his expression lightened, and he became very interested in his hobbies. He flipped through the pages and was shocked to find near-Pro levels of analysis on quirks, fighting styles, applications of Heroes and other things that could be used to vastly improve one\u2019s abilities on the field. Izuku had insisted it was just a hobby, and Hizashi explained that he\u2019d written all of this just from what he gathered on TV. That fact alone was shocking, that he could gather such a thorough analysis from only news clips.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Nedzu started, closing the notebook and sliding it back across the desk, \u201cyou certainly have a talent for analysis, Midoriya-san. I think that if you were to come to U.A in your time, we\u2019d be able to help you develop it into a rather sharp edge, so to speak. Would you be interested in being a student here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInterested in\u2026?\u201d Izuku trailed off, his eyes wide with hope. \u201cIt was my ch-childhood dream to go to U.A!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, provided I am still the Principal in your time - which I have no plans to leave, mind you - I will keep a close eye on you until the time when you return from the quirk. Afterwards, I would like to take you on as a personal student, and have one of the teachers instruct you in a martial art, perhaps. You wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the Hero course immediately, as you\u2019ve said the acceptance letters were already sent, but these books alone are worth an admittance to the Gen Ed course. If you still wish to try for the Hero Course, you should participate in the Sports Festival, and use your abilities to read your opponents and take a place in the top 3.\u201d Nedzu explained with\u00a0 smile. Izuku looked at him with a sort of awe, tears already in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Y-You mean I\u2026 I could go to\u2026 to U.A?\u201d He asked, voice crackling. Nedzu chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-san, in 15 years, you will already be a student. I\u2019ll have everything set up. I\u2019d be a fool not to accept such a bright young mind!\u201d he laughed, then his expression went serious again. \u201cOf course, as you said, we won\u2019t be able to interfere with your life. We would be forced to let you go through everything you went through to get to that point. So I\u2019ll ask you, Aizawa-san, Yamada-san, you must not interfere with Izuku\u2019s life. As much as it pains all of us to do so, we would never have met him otherwise. I mean this with everything I have, you two - <em> do not </em> interfere with his life until we can catch him in 15 years, understand? Afterwards, I will have everything I need to make amends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Shouta nodded, then Hizashi. They knew the consequences of interfering. The second they changed even a miniscule event in Izuku\u2019s life, they\u2019d forget everything about him. He would never have met them, because they altered his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Now then, Midoriya-san, since we know about everything\u2026 Would you be so kind as to allow Recovery Girl a look at you? A full workup, that way we can determine if everything healed properly aside from the outside. If you have any long-lasting damage, it may affect your ability to get into the Hero Course.\u201d Nedzu explained. Izuku nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I have, like, aches sometimes, but I think they\u2019re more\u2026 um\u2026 psychological than actual pains? If that makes sense\u2026\u201d He said quietly. Nedzu nodded understandingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that makes perfect sense. Still, have Recovery Girl check you out. In the meantime, I have a lot of work to do regarding your situation\u2026\u201d Nedzu had a dark smile on his face and both Shouta and Hizashi shuddered to think of what their Principal would do to the people who hurt Izuku. They had no idea what was coming\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go see Recovery Girl!\u201d Hizashi smiled, trying to lighten the mood for Izuku. \u201cWe\u2019ll show you the way. U.A can be a little confusing, sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-Okay! Lead the way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The checkup with Recovery Girl was difficult, if only because he had to show her every scar he\u2019d gotten over his lifetime, and she poked and prodded and looked at each. She did full scans, in order to make sure that everything was still correct with his body. In the end, there was no permanent damage to any bones, muscles or nerves and Izuku was grateful for that. He had a chance, a shot at proving everybody wrong. He could be a Hero. He <em> would </em> be a Hero.</p>\n<p>He was going to be a quirkless Hero - and he was going to prove himself even to All Might. He had friends, he had a\u2026 father figure(?) in Nedzu (he still wasn\u2019t sure how to quantify that relationship, but he was grateful for it nonetheless), and he had a <em> chance</em>.</p>\n<p>All he had to do was trust them, and hope they still remembered.</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next week went by almost quietly, with Shouta and Hizashi\u2019s return to school looming over them. They didn\u2019t want to go back, but they had to, and Izuku\u2019s first month was almost up. He had no idea if he\u2019d be spending another one, but it would be a lot less enjoyable with both of his friends being gone all day for most of the week.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYo, Shouta, Izuku! I had an idea, if you\u2019re interested!\u201d Hizashi offered one day at lunch, and the other two looked up to him curiously. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if Izuku\u2019s ever been to one\u2026 so we should take him to a festival before the end of summer break! There\u2019s one tomorrow, down by the river, and I think it would be really fun, y\u2019know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA\u2026 Festival?\u201d Izuku asked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen and heard them before, but I\u2019ve never been to one, at least none I was old enough to remember\u2026 Are they fun?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been to a festival?\u201d Shouta asked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cThey\u2019re a little loud, but some people enjoy going to them. Usually they\u2019re something you do with friends. If you want, we could go? We\u2019d have to go out and get you a yukata, but I don\u2019t see an issue.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think\u2026 yes, I\u2019d like to go! I want to do as much with you guys as I can, before I go.\u201d Izuku smiled, and they both smiled back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s settled then. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll go to the summer festival!\u201d Hizashi cheered. \u201cBut first, we should probably clean up lunch.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The process of picking out a yukata was easier said than done, since Izuku had only worn one when he was very young and could barely remember how to wear one. He finally settled on a design, though, and took it home for the festival the next day. He was excited to wear his, and see his friends in theirs. Festival time came quickly, and Izuku was more excited than he had been in a while. It was strange, doing something so public, like he was saying to the world: \u201cHey! I have friends, look at me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Izuku didn\u2019t mind. And he wanted to be strong, because they didn\u2019t mind his scars, so he decided not to wear his arm covers. Shouta and Hizashi liked him just the way he was, and that was good enough for him. So he pulled on his brand-new yukata the day of the festival, tied it up, and got ready to go. He would be fine showing his scars. He had no idea what to really expect, never having been to one properly, but he was eager nonetheless.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he stepped out of the guest bedroom, he was surprised to see Shouta and Hizashi already in theirs. Shouta was wearing a plain, white yukata with a black tie around the waist. The hem had black waves embroidered on it, with grey pinstripes along the rest. Hizashi\u2019s was black, with gold and white fireworks printed on the design, and a silky gold tie on the waist. Shouta had his normally long hair in a tiny ponytail, and combined with the yukata, it made his neck very open and his jawline exposed. Hizashi, on the other hand, had his normally gelled hair down, hitting just past his shoulders and framing his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They both looked really nice in yukatas, and Izuku was a little embarrassed in his own, but stepped out into the living room anyways. He wore a soft, pastel green yukata with white stripes, and a black tie around the waist and the shoulders, keeping his sleeves up and his arms exposed. When Shouta and Hizashi saw him, they both turned and they looked surprised. Izuku blushed a little under all the attention, still not quite used to it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, Izuku, you look fantastic!\u201d Hizashi grinned. Shouta nodded in agreement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you look really nice.\u201d He said, almost shyly. Izuku\u2019s whole face went red at the compliments, but he smiled anyways.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTh-Thanks! You guys too, you look good!\u201d He returned the compliments, and then it was their turn to be red. \u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s okay if I show my arms\u2026? It won\u2019t bother you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIzuku, we\u2019re never bothered by you. Your arms are just fine, it\u2019s your choice to show them.\u201d Hizashi said, and Izuku smiled brightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight! I don\u2019t mind as long as it\u2019s you guys.\u201d He said, as if they could do anything and Izuku wouldn\u2019t care. They probably could, but they only wanted to show him respect and care.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cW-Well,\u201d Shouta cleared his throat, \u201cWe should get going. The festival starts soon. Oh, and Izuku, we wanted to ask, would you be comfortable staying to watch the fireworks? We know how you get around loud noises like that, especially, you know, exploding ones.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, um\u2026 Maybe? I\u2019ve heard them before but I\u2019ve never stayed to watch. I-I\u2019d like to try, at least. I\u2019ll let you know if it\u2019s too much.\u201d He reassured, and that was enough for them. He knew his limits, and even if he didn\u2019t say anything, they could always tell when Izuku was having enough of something. They led the way out of the apartment, and he could see in the distance a festival going on by a river nearby. People were already gathering together at the entrance, crowd bigger than Izuku had been in beginning to form.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku looked over the city and watched the glow of the sun sink over the buildings, and he knew he wanted to experience everything that came with being with friends, no matter what.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It didn\u2019t take them long to get there, living close by. It was in a small, out of the way shrine by the river, the whole place lit up with lanterns and the smell of food wafting through the air. There were so many colorful booths, all with different games and refreshments and activities. Izuku looked around at them in awe, not sure where to start. There was just so much to do! Luckily for him and Shouta, Hizashi had enough energy for the both of them and plenty of ideas to have fun.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The festival was loud and outgoing and a bit of sensory overload, but Izuku wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. There was just so much of everything to do, lanterns floating in the river and strung up all around the shrine it was being hosted at. Izuku couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of any of it, entranced by everything. Shouta and Hizashi, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t stop watching Izuku, happy that he was enjoying himself so much. Izuku looked at everything around him with an almost reverent gaze, intense and burning and excitable like he always was when he was learning about something new. It never ceased to draw in his two friends, the sheer passion he had for life and learning. They were glad to be the ones to show him the world, so to speak.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku\u2019s first stop was trying food from the festival stalls. He hadn\u2019t eaten much that day, excited to try as much as possible at the festival. He bought yakisoba and takoyaki, shared it with Shouta and Hizashi, and was delighted when it was as good as he was expecting. The stall vendors loved Izuku, too, happy to serve a customer as personable as he was. He tried taiyaki and all sorts of treats on sticks next, and decided immediately that cotton candy was his favorite festival treat. Food was an integral part of any festival experience, and Izuku clearly capitalized on that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hizashi insisted they try games next - he was intent on putting Izuku\u2019s analysis to use on the often rigged prize-winning ones. He was surprised to find that Izuku wasn\u2019t as good with the carnival games as the ones in the arcade, but he made do and was still able to win a few things. He wanted to win Izuku a goldfish from the scooping game, but Shouta gently reminded him that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it. He pouted the entire time, but accepted his goldfish-less fate anyways.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, Hizashi, look over there!\u201d Izuku pointed to a different booth. It had prizes lined up in the back and cork rifles on the sill. \u201cIt\u2019s an All Might figure, in that shooting game! It\u2019s such a rare and limited edition one in my time, it must be one of his older costumes!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you still like All Might even after he said that stuff to you.\u201d Shouta huffed. Izuku smiled a little, but shook his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s a Symbol, you know? It\u2019s hard not to like him, even after\u2026 well. Besides, he\u2019s not really my favorite Hero in the future, anyways. He used to be, when I was younger, but it changed after I found some Heroes I thought were even cooler.\u201d Izuku\u2019s smile spread to a grin, like he knew something they didn\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Hizashi piped up, curious, \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite Heroes, then?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell\u2026 My favorite Heroes are both of you!\u201d He laughed a little, and Shouta\u2019s eyes went wide. Izuku thought </span>\n<em>\n<span>he</span>\n</em>\n<span> was\u2026 his favorite hero? Hizashi, too? \u201cWithout giving away </span>\n<em>\n<span>too</span>\n</em>\n<span> much about the future, you guys both fight mostly quirkless. Hizashi does when his quirk is too much for civilians, and I just thought\u2026 i-it was really cool, you know? You inspired me a lot, even when others said I could never be a Hero.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIzuku\u2026 I\u2019m glad I could inspire you. But\u2026 I want to be an underground hero. How did you find out about me?\u201d Shouta asked, though he turned his head so Izuku couldn\u2019t see his face. He was a bit embarrassed at being told he was somebody\u2019s favorite Hero.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m, um, persistent, I guess? I wanted to know if there were any quirkless Heroes and eventually just found you both after a lot of hard work.\u201d Izuku explained. Hizashi grinned and slung an arm around his shoulders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAww, I\u2019m happy we could be cool Heroes for you, Izuku! I feel better about my future career if I can inspire somebody like you.\u201d he ruffled Izuku\u2019s hair, and then pointed to the game. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try to win that All Might figure? Another thing to take with you!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh! Can we? It seems like fun!\u201d And with that, he was dragged off to the game to play. Shouta watched with amusement as Hizashi got an earful of how to go about a shooting gallery game (courtesy of a future Hero named \u2018Snipe,\u2019 apparently). After a few mishaps, the figure came tumbling down with ease. Izuku really did have a love for life, and it drew Shouta\u2019s thoughts back to what he had told them a week ago.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku had jumped. He had wanted to be done with his own life at age 15. He could see the scars, and the one on his chest was beyond anything he could\u2019ve imagined. Still, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2026 what kind of so called \u2018life\u2019 would one have been put through in order for somebody as driven as Izuku to give up? It was a terrifying and dark thought. It was second only to the thought that he wanted to make sure Izuku\u2019s life was never like that again, one thought he was sure Hizashi shared with him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now wasn\u2019t the time to think about it, though - he was here to make sure Izuku had fun, and by extension, that meant he had to have fun. Izuku picked up on other\u2019s emotions really easily, and he wasn\u2019t about to mess up a wonderful evening.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next stop was the shrine itself, decked head to toe in decorations and people in official shrine attire doing some kind of dance. It was a yearly festival dance, and Izuku found himself drawn in by the movements of the shrine attendants. He ended up moving along just a bit, enjoying the rhythm of the music and the atmosphere of the shrine. The lights of the lanterns and sunset glimmered in Izuku\u2019s eyes and gave him an otherworldly look. His face shone with all the light of somebody who had been given the ultimate treasure.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta and Hizashi\u2019s faces shone with the same light when they looked at their friend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou having fun?\u201d Shouta asked, a small, amused smile on his face as he watched Izuku bounce in time with the music. Izuku nodded enthusiastically.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah! This is so much fun! It\u2019s like\u2026\u201d He seemed to pause, still bouncing as he gathered his thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like I get to show everybody I have friends! All these people\u2026 they get to see me being happy, it\u2019s almost\u2026 I dunno, it\u2019s like saying to the world that I exist! I\u2019m here! Is that\u2026 is that weird?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo... not at all.\u201d Shouta nodded understandingly. It was like a slap in the face to everybody who\u2019d told him he was worthless, being in public with people who cared about him. It made Izuku happy, so that was all that mattered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlus, I get to spend time with you and Hizashi\u2026 I\u2019m happy no matter what we do if it\u2019s with you guys. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll work out in the future\u2026 but I hope we can keep doing things together. E-Even if you\u2019re older, would you... still be my friends? I know it\u2019s a lot to ask for\u2026 But being friends with both of you has made me so happy\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIzuku, we\u2019ll always be friends. No matter what.\u201d Shouta said, and it was firm and Izuku believed him. Shouta never lied or held anything back. If he said they\u2019d always be friends\u2026 well, Izuku had no choice but to believe him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah! We can\u2019t show favoritism as Pro Heroes, but outside of work, we\u2019ll be happy to hang out!\u201d Hizashi reassured him. \u201cYou\u2019re our friend, Izuku, no matter what, like Shouta said. We\u2019ll help you through whatever you need.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay\u2026 okay. Thank you,\u201d Izuku smiled genuinely, the corners of his eyes crinkling. \u201cReally, thank you so much, for everything you\u2019ve both done for me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The final stop of the festival was the fireworks. They made their way down to the river where groups of people stuck together, some friends and some families. Shouta and Hizashi picked a spot for them, and they sat on the grass, eyes up to the stars. The night had settled over them like a blanket, glistening lights shining down on them as if to keep them warm even from millions of lightyears away. Izuku always did like the stars, and the festival night was no exception.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a whir and a hiss and a bang, the first firework exploded, blossoming in the sky like a flower. The noise nearly gave Izuku a heart attack, reminding him almost too much of Bakugou - </span>\n<em>\n<span>pop pop boom, smoke, burning flesh, useless, quirkless, searing, burning -</span>\n</em>\n<span> but the color and sparkle gave way to wonder. Izuku\u2019s eyes were wide at the vivid lights in the sky - blue, purple, red, green, white, yellow, gold, glitter and glam, and everything in between. The explosions became only an after thought, noises lost as he leaned into his friends.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hizashi wrapped a protective arm around Izuku\u2019s waist, and Izuku leaned against Shouta\u2019s shoulder to watch the sky. He hadn\u2019t ever seen anything so </span>\n<em>\n<span>beautiful</span>\n</em>\n<span> in combustion before. It was always violent and forceful from Bakugou\u2019s hands, but now it was tender and passionate as it lit up the sky. Izuku almost couldn\u2019t believe it. It was bright and loud and everything he\u2019d expect from Bakugou yet nothing like him at all, simply because he was there with his friends.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 So beautiful\u2026\u201d Izuku said, almost breathless as he watched the display. Shouta smiled peacefully at Izuku\u2019s voice, happy he could enjoy something that would otherwise probably terrify him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMm.\u201d Shouta gave a hum of agreement. \u201cFireworks are always pretty fun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI want to see them again some time.\u201d Izuku said softly. Hizashi laced his fingers with Izuku\u2019s and smiled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell then, we\u2019ll have to take you to another festival in the future.\u201d He said. Shouta nodded, following Hizashi\u2019s lead and taking hold of Izuku\u2019s other hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs many as you want. We\u2019ll go to all of them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m with you guys.\u201d Izuku murmured.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And while they rested on the grass, watching the fireworks, Izuku felt like he\u2019d been yanked backwards, the feeling of falling overwhelming his senses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>You\u2019ll feel it pulling you about a day before you\u2019re due back!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku\u2019s eyes went wide. He was going back tomorrow. He looked between his friends and held onto them tightly. Then, to himself, he whispered:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>15 Years in the Future</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Yamada-sensei!\u201d One of the students in the classroom stayed behind after the bell rang, and Hizashi gave his signature grin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, little listener?\u201d He asked, leaning back in his desk chair. The student gave a sheepish smile back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I was wondering, are you an All Might fan, too? You keep one of those really old figures on your desk all the time, so\u2026\u201d he trailed off. Hizashi looked at the figure, still perfectly intact in its box and the plastic untouched. Hizashi shook his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah, not really. I mean, I respect him as the Symbol of Peace and all that, but this figure isn\u2019t cause I\u2019m a fan. This belonged to a friend of mine a long time ago! I\u2019m keeping it safe for him until I can see him again.\u201d He said, his grin fading into something akin to a somber remembrance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, sensei, I didn\u2019t mean to bring up bad memories.\u201d The student bowed apologetically, and Hizashi laughed, bounding back to his happy go lucky self.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo worries, kiddo, you\u2019re just fine! He\u2019s not dead or anything, we just haven\u2019t seen each other in a long time. I\u2019ll see him soon, though. Not too much longer.\u201d He said, his eyes stony with determination. The student looked a little confused, but happy for him anyways.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good then. Thank you for humoring me, sensei! See you in class tomorrow!\u201d The student waved and stepped out of the classroom. Hizashi placed a delicate hand on the boxed figure, smiling softly at it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re coming to get you soon, Izuku. We promised.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>The entire night, Izuku was quiet. He spent it writing in his journal, as much as possible, until nearly every page was crammed to the gills. He hardly got any sleep, too worried about going back to think about anything else. He only stopped when Shouta had forced him to, practically dragging him to the futon against his will just so he would rest.</p>\n<p>The next morning, he made the biggest breakfast yet, and did as much as he could around the apartment. Made meals ahead of time for Shouta and Hizashi to take with them to school that week, cleaned every inch of the guest room he\u2019d taken up, and packed away all of his things neatly in a box, aside from what he was taking back directly. Shouta had asked what he was doing, but he didn\u2019t say a word. He wanted to to be ready to tell them, and he could feel the pull of the quirk getting stronger with each passing hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, c\u2019mon, you\u2019ve been working all day! Come hang out with us!\u201d Hizashi whined, leaning off the arm of the couch. Izuku smiled and shook his head. It was afternoon, now, and he could feel it practically tugging on his insides. He could feel the air moving past him in slow-motion, ready to go back to falling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry, I have to finish these things.\u201d he said apologetically, putting away the cleaning supplies. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you as soon as I\u2019m done, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he sighed dramatically, \u201cbut I call dibs on you when you\u2019re done! No Izuku for Shouta!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Shouta said, a little indignant. \u201cYou can\u2019t call dibs on a person, Hizashi!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan too! I just did.\u201d He stuck out his tongue playfully. Shouta just rolled his eyes at Hizashi\u2019s antics.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you cleaning so much for, anyways? Did you have a nightmare last night?\u201d Shouta asked, and Izuku shook his head. He went into the guest bedroom and came back out with his backpack and one of his journals labelled \u2018My Time in the Past.\u2019 It was the one he\u2019d been writing in non-stop, and his friends looked at him with confused expressions.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, take this, please.\u201d He said, handing it to Shouta. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 going back tonight. I felt the pull last night, during the fireworks display. It has what you need to come and get me in the future. The date, time, and location.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Shouta stood, taking the journal in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going back and you didn\u2019t say anything? We would\u2019ve helped you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I know!\u201d Izuku jumped at the sudden outburst, hands up defensively. \u201cI just got, you know, a-anxious about it, so I figured cleaning and cooking would help! It did, so I\u2019m telling you now that I\u2019m calm!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c... I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d Shouta sighed. \u201cBut you\u2019re going back\u2026 and we won\u2019t see you for 15 years! We could\u2019ve done something with you today to see you off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is exactly how I\u2019d want to spend my last day, being around both of you and doing what helps me calm down. I\u2019ve been so happy here with you guys\u2026 I just wanted to spend some time with both of you in peace.\u201d Izuku smiled brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2026 are you sure, Izuku? Is there anything we can do before you go? Nothing you want to do or see within your time limit?\u201d Hizashi asked, and Izuku paused for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think\u2026 I\u2019d just like to watch a movie here with you both. Nothing special. That way it feels less like a goodbye\u2026 and more like an \u2018I\u2019ll see you later,\u2019 you know?\u201d Izuku explained. Hizashi sighed this time as he nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess, if that\u2019s what you want. You pick, we\u2019ll make snacks! And we\u2019ll have to make a call to Principal Nedzu, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to say bye too!\u201d He insisted, and Izuku nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds perfect!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, they settled on an old pre-quirk superhero movie, and settled down on the couch to start. Before they did, though, Hizashi pressed his phone into Izuku\u2019s hand and gave him a look that said he wasn\u2019t getting out of a phone call to their Principal. Izuku sighed, resigned to his fate. He dialed up Nedzu\u2019s school phone number, and it rang a few times before he picked up.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cHello, Yamada-san, how can I help you?\u201d </em>Came Nedzu\u2019s cheery voice over the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, actually, this is Midoriya, sir. I wanted to call and let you know that I\u2019m going to be returning to my time tonight. I felt the pull yesterday, and Hizashi made sure I let you know.\u201d Izuku explained, and he heard the Principal make a thoughtful sort of noise on the other end.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI see. Would you like your return to be private? I was going to ask if we could watch to study the quirk, but I understand if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to be seen.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026 yes, I think I would like it to be. I\u2019d prefer if it was just Shouta, Hizashi and I\u2026 I hope that isn\u2019t an inconvenience.\u201d Izuku mumbled, a bit nervous to be saying no to Nedzu.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Certainly not, don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll have the chance to observe when the quirk takes place in the future, after all. I wish you a safe journey, Midoriya-san, and I look forward to having you as a student.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAh, me too, sir! I look forward to learning with you! And please, I know it will be a long time for everyone on this side of things\u2026 so I\u2019ve left some things here, my analysis journals on the Heroes of this time. I hope you can find them useful, and please, take care of Shouta and Hizashi while I\u2019m gone...\u201d Izuku asked, trying not to get emotional.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You have my word, Midoriya-san. They\u2019ll be taken care of to the best of my abilities at U.A. I suppose we\u2019ll be seeing eachother soon, yes?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYes, soon.\u201d Izuku gave a dry laugh. \u201cThank you for everything, Principal Nedzu. It means the world to me. I\u2019ll see you when I get back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cSee you then, Izuku.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Click. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s hands shook as he pressed the end call button. Shouta took it gently from his hands and put it on the table. Izuku held in the tears, determined not to cry for his friends\u2019 sakes. They were the ones having to wait the longest, and he felt it was unfair to them to get emotional\u2026 but he couldn\u2019t help it. Nedzu had been so kind and understanding, and here he was, saying goodbye for 15 years. Izuku felt terrible for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Shouta\u2019s voice rumbled, and Izuku curled into his side. \u201cLike you said, it\u2019s not a goodbye. It\u2019s a \u2018see you later.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. We\u2019ll see you again, Izuku.\u201d Hizashi draped himself over both Izuku and Shouta\u2019s laps. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you, okay? Let\u2019s just watch the movie and enjoy the rest of the night, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d Izuku sniffled, and turned his attention to the movie as it started. There wasn\u2019t a place he\u2019d rather be, at his friends\u2019 sides and simply existing with them.</p>\n<p>The movie wasn\u2019t anything special, but he enjoyed every second of it anyways.</p>\n<p>As it went on, he felt the pull getting stronger. He felt the air being pulled from his lungs, and the weightless feeling of falling was washing over him again. A light flickered above their heads, and got their attention as the movie credits were beginning to roll. The portal was forming, and Izuku could hardly breathe as the quirk tugged on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt-It\u2019s starting\u2026!\u201d Izuku cried, feeling his body start to move involuntarily. It felt so sudden, and he couldn\u2019t stop the thoughts racing in his head from coming out.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku! We\u2019ll come get you, we promised, remember?\u201d Shouta held onto his hand, and Izuku nodded, but tears were spilling from his eyes anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, b-but please, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to go!\u201d He sobbed, reaching for his friends as the portal tugged him upwards. \u201cI want to stay here with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, you can do this!\u201d Hizashi picked up his backpack from the floor and slung it over Izuku\u2019s shoulder. He was crying too, reaching for his friend\u2019s face. \u201cRemember, it\u2019s not a goodbye! I promise we\u2019ll see you again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t - I don\u2019t want to go, please, I don\u2019t want to go!\u201d Izuku clutched onto Shouta\u2019s hands, but felt the pull become too strong for him to hold on. \u201cPlease, please, I don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t want to go! Please, please, I don\u2019t-!\u201d</p>\n<p>But the quirk didn\u2019t stop. Before he could say anything else, Izuku was gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> My Time in the Past </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Entry #1 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Today, I got journals after my appointment with Principal Nedzu. It\u2019s a relief to finally be writing, it felt so weird not to have anything in my hands for so long. I was so nervous, asking to go to a stationary store, but Shouta and Hizashi didn\u2019t mind at all. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Oh, and I also told them I was from the future today! They told me they didn\u2019t care about their timelines, just that they were my friends. It was so much more than I could have hoped for. It\u2019s so strange, calling people my friends. But it\u2019s nice. They\u2019re nothing like Kacchan. I don\u2019t have to be afraid around them, and they actually care about what I have to say. I think I\u2019ve done more talking these past two weeks than I have the entire last year of school. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019s the good kind of talking, though. I stutter and I mumble still, but they don\u2019t care. They listen anyways. Maybe it bugs them, but they\u2019re too nice to say anything? Either way, the fact that they let me go on like I do is something else. Is this what it\u2019s like for other people? I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just happy I can talk to them. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> They even held my hands and helped me after my nightmare. Mom used to do that a long time ago, but I don\u2019t remember the last time she did. It felt nice. They were warm. I hope I can hold their hands again. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Entry #5 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Today, Hizashi took me to an arcade! It was so much fun! There was so much to see and do, and I couldn\u2019t help but want to try everything. He was very patient with me. I played a video game, and Hizashi said I was a natural. I even got the high score! I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw it, but Hizashi picked me up and spun me around like crazy. It was fun and exciting and I\u2019d do it all over again if I could! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Then I showed Hizashi the best way to win at crane games. We won a stuffed rabbit, which I gave to him to keep. I want him to have something to remember me by! But he wanted to give me something, too, so we took a picture together! I\u2019m going to tape it to the inside of the journal so I don\u2019t lose my copy. I just need a picture with all three of us next! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> And then - I can still feel my hands shaking when I write this, I was so emotional, gosh - Hizashi told me something I never thought I\u2019d hear. He took one look at my analysis notebooks and told me I could be a hero. It was the first time somebody ever told me I could be. He even called All Might - All Might!!!! - an idiot! I admit I cried a lot, but Hizashi didn\u2019t seem to mind. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> He and Shouta never do mind, which is something I\u2019ll always be grateful for. I feel sick for not telling them what\u2019s coming. Maybe I should. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll think about it some more. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Entry #7 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Shouta taught me some basics of self-defense today. It was exhausting but fun. I had no idea a workout could be fun! Apparently when you\u2019re doing it with your friend, it\u2019s fun. He got really mad. Not at me, though! He just saw my scars. They\u2019re so gross, but he said he was just mad that somebody put them there. It was hard to take, somebody being mad on my behalf. It\u2019s never happened before, but it was kind of\u2026 nice? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> He said he taught me so that I wouldn\u2019t have to get any more scars. Apparently, when I had that nightmare, I told them somebody put them there. They know now. It was always my fault, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll see it that way\u2026 they\u2019re different. I think I can tell them. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> But it made me think\u2026 well, more like realize something. I don\u2019t want to die. When I think about Shouta and Hizashi, I just keep wanting to live. It\u2019s almost scarier than it was to jump. I know it\u2019s not healthy to be dependent on them so much, but maybe I can do it just for a little while. Maybe I can tell them I jumped. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I think I will tell them. Maybe they\u2019ll remember, maybe they won\u2019t, but it\u2019s worth a shot, I guess. I\u2019ll know that no matter what happens, at least for a little while, I had two friends who cared. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Entry #8 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Oh god, I told them! I told them I jumped and they said they\u2019d catch me! I could hardly breathe through the end of that talk, and they just hugged me and said they\u2019d catch me I can hardly believe it. I told Principal Nedzu too. Well, Shouta and Hizashi told him for me. I couldn\u2019t handle talking about it twice. They\u2019re so kind to me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> And you\u2019ll never believe what happened after. I still can\u2019t believe it myself! Nedzu looked at my journals and said I could be a student at U.A! He wants to tutor me so I can be a hero! He said a teacher would teach me martial arts? I\u2019m not so sure about that last one but! I have a position at U.A in my own time! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ever since I was a kid and I saw the U.A sports festival and learned it\u2019s where All Might went (I don\u2019t care about that any more. But it is where Shouta and Hizashi go and that\u2019s more important to me anyways) I\u2019ve always wanted to go to U.A! And now Principal Nedzu himself is offering me a position as a student there?! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I only hope I live up to the teacher\u2019s expectations. It was hard enough making friends with Shouta and Hizashi. And oh my god, they\u2019re Pro Heroes in the future! I can\u2019t believe that I made friends with Eraserhead and Present Mic! I wonder what they\u2019ll think of me when they\u2019re older\u2026 Even if they just catch me and never talk to me again I\u2019d be more than happy to know they valued my time in the past, at the very least. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019ll be sad to go. I like spending time here, being with them now. I wish it was up to me whether or not to go back, but that\u2019s not how the quirk works. Even so, I\u2019m grateful for whoever hit me with it. I hope I can figure out who it was and thank them. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Entry #15 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Today, I saw the most beautiful thing in the entire world.

I even won a really rare, vintage All Might figure. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> My favorite part was the fireworks. It was the first time since childhood that I wasn\u2019t afraid of the sound of an explosion. Kacchan could never take fireworks away from me, because Shouta and Hizashi made them theirs.

One of the other teachers said you left in the middle of class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em> him</em>.\u201d Shouta growled angrily. \u201cNedzu put <em> him </em> in my class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d Hizashi rose an eyebrow as he squatted down by his friend. Shouta grumbled profanities under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Bakugou Katsuki</em>. He was put in my fucking class, \u2018Zashi.\u201d Shouta\u2019s hands practically white-knuckled his juice, and Hizashi\u2019s mouth pursed into a fine line. \u201cWe got our rosters for the next school year, after the entrance exam letters were sent out. <em> Nedzu </em> put the guy that beat Izuku until he wanted to die and then told him to into <em> my fucking class</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShouta\u2026 I know it sucks, like, a <em> lot</em>, but Nedzu has a plan. He always does. We can\u2019t mess with Izuku\u2019s timeline, you know that. It\u2019s <em> tomorrow.</em>\u00a0One more day, and then we can catch him and give him a better life. We\u2019ve been working for the last 15 years to make sure he gets one, right? We can\u2019t mess it up just to get back at Bakugou, as much as we <em> both </em> want to. And trust me, we both definitely want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know\u2026 I know, Zashi, but it\u2019s so unfair! We couldn\u2019t do a single thing to make his life better! How can we call ourselves Heroes when there\u2019s a child being abused that we couldn\u2019t do anything about?\u201d Shouta tossed the now empty juice pack into the trashcan with scary precision.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe <em> did </em> do something about it. Izuku stayed with us and we gave him the ability to trust and see his own self worth. He told us we were the ones who helped him not want to die! If it weren\u2019t for us, he would\u2019ve gone back and never said a word to anybody, and just\u2026 let himself fall. Like you said a long time ago, we did all we could then for the Izuku we\u2019ll see again.\u201d Hizashi murmured, holding Shouta\u2019s hands in his. Gold wedding bands glinted in the fluorescent light of the lounge, and Shouta looked at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be mad that we got married?\u201d He asked, and Hizashi snorted with laughter and shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! If anything, I think he\u2019ll be happy for us. He knew we would be adults when he came back, he\u2019d understand. Izuku\u2019s a smart kid. You read his journals every other night, you should know! And besides, I think he\u2019d be more interested in seeing how our quirks could work as a duo than the fact that we\u2019re married.\u201d Hizashi said, his tone light. Shouta seemed to relax his whole body as he sighed, finally calming down.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. You usually are. I should get back to class\u2026 those damn kids are always problems. I had to expel half of them the first month. At least the upcoming batch looks promising, aside from\u2026 ugh.\u201d Shouta grumbled. \u201cStill leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I can\u2019t believe if we\u2019d never met Izuku, <em> he </em> would\u2019ve just been allowed into U.A and Izuku would never have joined. Something is very wrong there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Aldera Jr. High is wrong for falsifying their records! Nedzu\u2019s got a plan for them too. So come on, let\u2019s get back to class. We\u2019ll be there tomorrow, Shouta. We\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nedzu looked at the stack of papers in his office, along with a set of thin journals and a photograph of Izuku from his school pictures. He looked like he was ready to bolt, more terrified than happy as he smiled. What kind of school made their students terrified just to take pictures? He was so ready to tear Aldera Jr. High from the ground up for negligence and falsifying reports and a boatload of other charges. Just one more day.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrincipal Nedzu?\u201d A knock came to his office door.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d He smiled widely as Nemuri entered his office. The tall woman smiled back at him and took a seat across from his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, sir?\u201d She asked, crossing her legs. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a surprise for you to call me in here so suddenly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I have something I\u2019d appreciate your help with. Do you see this boy?\u201d He pushed the photo of Izuku across the desk to her, and her face lit up with recognition.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! That\u2019s the kid from the photo on Shouta\u2019s desk! Who is he?\u201d She asked, leaning forward curiously. Nemuri was dying to know just who Shouta\u2019s other high school friend was. Nedzu chuckled a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a rather curious case we\u2019ve been observing for a while. I\u2019ll let Aizawa-san and Yamada-san tell you the entire story if they wish, he is their friend after all. The problem is that tomorrow, he will\u2026 ah, how do I put this gently\u2026 he will attempt to end his own life. We\u2019ve already taken precautions and he will not be hurt, of course, but he might be in a rather fragile state when we go to retrieve him. He might have a panic attack or otherwise lash out, and I think it would be useful if you could be there, simply in case of emergency.\u201d Nedzu explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026 how do you know he\u2019s going to? I don\u2019t mind helping you, sir, I\u2019m just a little confused. If he\u2019s told you already, shouldn\u2019t you just get him help now, <em> before </em> he hurts himself?\u201d She asked, \u201cand besides, he\u2019s our age now, right? Why would he contact the Principal of a high school for help, anyways?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is the part of the story that is not mine to tell, unfortunately. All I can say is that he is not our age, he is a 15-year-old boy, and due to circumstances out of our control, he cannot be helped until after he makes the attempt. Shouta and Hizashi can explain the situation to you if you wish, but do not force them. All I\u2019m asking is that you be there in case he panics.\u201d Nedzu said firmly, a tone of voice that said he wouldn\u2019t take an argument.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, if you say so, sir. I\u2019ll be here tomorrow whenever you need me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c-want to go\u2026!\u201d Izuku felt like he had been pulled into nothingness.</p>\n<p>After the blinding brightness, there was just the murky, black void. He floated, almost peacefully. Izuku remembered this place. It was where he went after he jumped. The person who sent him to the past made this space. The peaceful, quiet floating helped to calm him down from his panic attack as he\u2019d been sucked into the portal. He was a little mad at himself. He had said he didn\u2019t want to get emotional, and yet he had to go and say those things as he was leaving\u2026</p>\n<p>He supposed it didn\u2019t matter, now.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d He called out, finding it in him to speak this time. His voice was muffled, almost like he was underwater. It <em> did </em> feel like he was floating, so he supposed it made sense. \u201cAre you there? The person that used the quirk on me?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Oh, you\u2019re back! </em> The voice came again, pleasantly surprised. <em> Looks like your month or two is up, huh? I hope you found somebody to catch you! I really, really don\u2019t want to watch you die after all this, you know! </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI found friends!\u201d Izuku said, with renewed confidence. \u201cThey promised to be there! Even though it\u2019s been 15 years, they promised\u2026 I trust them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> 15 years?! Holy cow, how far back did I send you?! Well, whatever the case, if you think they\u2019ve got you\u2026\u00a0 that\u2019s good. I told you, you didn\u2019t deserve to die. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just hard to believe\u2026 but they made me believe. I have something better waiting for me when I get back, now! I can\u2026 I can work towards my dreams because of them.\u201d Izuku smiled, eyes watery though no tears came this time.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ah, that\u2019s wonderful! I\u2019m very happy for you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for sending me to the past. I can\u2019t ever thank you enough. Can I\u2026 can I meet you, after this is over? I want to thank you properly, in person.\u201d Izuku asked, looking around as if there would be a person in front of him.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Huh? Meet me? Sure, kid, I guess so! I was just passing by, but I\u2019ll stick around to say hi, if it\u2019ll make you feel better. Fate works in mysterious ways. I\u2019m glad I could be there for you. And you\u2019re welcome, by the way! I don\u2019t know what heartless asshole could just watch a kid jump off of a roof and never do anything about it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAha\u2026 you\u2019d be surprised\u2026\u201d Izuku muttered. \u201cBut in all seriousness, thank you. I think I\u2019m ready to go back, now. I\u2019m less scared than I was before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Right, I\u2019ll open the portal for you. But listen, you\u2019re going to be conscious this time. You might want to close your eyes, okay? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Izuku nodded and squeezed his eyes shut as tight as he could. Even with his eyes closed he could feel the blinding brightness and warmth of the portal opening up again. He felt the air rushing forward, and the voice called out.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Good luck with your friends! </em>\n</p>\n<p>Then, Izuku fell. All of his muscles tensed and he yelled out, plummeting back towards the ground like he had a month ago. He kept yelling as he opened his eyes anyways, despite the voice telling him not to. He watched the school building rush past him. As he was falling, he felt something grab him by the torso and gently slow him to a stop.</p>\n<p>Just before he touched the ground, two pairs of arms wrapped snugly around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku!\u201d Two voices cried as they hugged him close. They sounded so familiar, they had to be\u2026 he couldn\u2019t believe it. Izuku broke down in tears again.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouta! Hizashi!\u201d He wailed, unashamed to be crying, this time. He didn\u2019t die. They caught him. They promised, and they kept it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got you, Izuku, we\u2019re here.\u201d Hizashi\u2019s voice, this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe promised, remember? We promised. No way we\u2019d let you fall.\u201d Shouta\u2019s voice. They both sounded older, but still the same as he remembered them. So kind, so gentle.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I was so scared! I felt the falling, a-and you weren\u2019t there anymore, and I\u2026!\u201d He sobbed and tried to get the words out. He felt Shouta\u2019s familiar hand - a bit bigger, now - gently run through his hair like he did the first time they met.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve got you now. We won\u2019t let you hurt any more.\u201d Hizashi reassured. Izuku\u2019s crying tapered off into hiccups and sniffles as he held onto his friends. He finally got a good look at them, now that his eyes weren\u2019t full of tears.</p>\n<p>Shouta was a little taller, with scruff on his chin and longer hair. He wore a scarf-like thing around his neck, which he realized was what caught him. It had been positioned in such a way as to slow his stop instead of making it sudden. Hizashi had gotten a <em> lot </em> taller, and his hair was a <em> lot </em> longer. They were still his friends, though, and they had caught him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTh-Th\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d Izuku finally managed to get out, voice now hoarse from yelling and crying. Hizashi smiled that beaming grin at him, though he had tears in his eyes as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe told you before, didn\u2019t we? We wouldn\u2019t forget. We could never forget you.\u201d Shouta said, his own voice on the verge of tears. As Eraserhead, he hadn\u2019t cried in a long time - but here, with a friend he\u2019d promised to save many years ago, he felt like he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe missed you, Izuku. We missed you so, so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Principal Nedzu! To what do I owe the honor?\u201d A round, portly man smiled ear-to-ear, walking the halls of Aldera Jr. High with the Principal of U.A.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you see, I have a student I wish to remove from your care, and teachers who would do well to have their licenses revoked. Perhaps you might wish to step down from your own position as Principal, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 Excuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A police officer knocked on an apartment door. It opened up to a blonde woman with sharp, red eyes. She sighed and leaned against the door frame.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she drawled, waiting for a response. The officer looked at her for just a moment, then nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You are Bakugou Mitsuki, correct? Is your son home?\u201d he asked, and the woman stood a little straighter. She looked almost surprised, but nodded back and turned into the apartment to yell for her son. The boy stalked forward, fists curling in his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cHah? What do you want?\u201d He asked, much in the same tone as his mother. The officer sighed. He could tell this wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to ask you to come with us. We have a few questions for you regarding illegal quirk usage, repeated assault, and instigating an attempted suicide.\u201d He said firmly, and the kid looked about ready to explode.</p>\n<p>\u201cFUCKING WHAT?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku stood up, bright and proud in a brand new U.A uniform. He shined his shoes and straightened his tie (not that he really knew how to properly tie one), and even fixed up his backpack. A knock came on his front door, and he jumped a little in surprise. His mother smiled and put a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been there for you, sweetheart. But I know you\u2019ll do great\u2026 maybe you\u2019ll let me make it up to you some time? I can make katsudon.\u201d Inko\u2019s smile was tired, but he could tell she was trying. \u201cI want to be better for you, Izuku. I hope you\u2019ll let me try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, mom, it\u2019s all I could ask for!\u201d Izuku beamed, leaning in for a hug. \u201cAll I ever wanted was to sit and have dinner with you like a family again. I\u2019m happy you want to try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, go ahead and get the door, then!\u201d Inko gestured to the door, and Izuku let her go so he could open the door. There was Hizashi, in casual attire, with Shouta standing behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouta! Hizashi!\u201d Izuku laughed, \u201cWhat are you both doing here?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we got special permission from Nedzu to walk you to school for today. We can\u2019t do it all the time, but we figured we\u2019d do it for your first day at U.A! It\u2019s spring break for us, but it\u2019s your first lessons with Nedzu!\u201d Hizashi patted Izuku on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s still <em> your </em> first day, you know? That stuff\u2019s important!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, your tie\u2019s a mess.\u201d Shouta huffed, coming forward to fix it for him. After a few moments it was neat again. \u201cYou tie it like this. See?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, I\u2019m still a little new to all of this\u2026 but I\u2019m so thankful I get to spend my first day with you both. If it weren\u2019t for you both\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d Izuku smiled, a little faltering, but then he looked at both of his friends. \u201cYou gave me a chance to live again, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d ever repay you\u2026! I\u2019m so glad that I have you as friends\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta ruffled Izuku\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to repay us, Izuku. That\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>END</em> </b>\n</p>"
