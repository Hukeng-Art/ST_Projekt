  "text": "<p>Crowley hadn\u2019t meant to fall.</p>\n<p>He was, unlike the rest of them, just following orders.</p>\n<p>Give Eve a choice. Let her make it. Crowley did as She asked, because that\u2019s all he\u2019s ever known. If anyone should have fallen, he thinks it should have been the angel that gave his sword away to the disgraced humans.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t actually think that.</p>\n<p>He was rather relieved, actually, that they would have fire, at least, to keep them warm and cook their food.</p>\n<p>When all is said and done, and rain pours down, the taste of Her tears sweet on his lips, Michael finds him sitting on the edge of the wall surrounding Eden. \u201cLucifer is dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley glances at her out of the side of his eye. She looks \u2013 different. Like glass that\u2019s shattered but still holding its shape. Before there was anyone, before he was more than a thought in Her mind, there was Michael, and she had Lucifer. Siblings, lovers, friends. Crowley hadn\u2019t known, and hadn\u2019t asked. But their hearts had beat as one, and now Michael\u2019s heart beats alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe burned up in the atmosphere,\u201d she continues, \u201chis death cleared the chemicals from the air outside the garden. The humans can breathe here now.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s looking up at the clear, beautiful sky, blue as far as they can see. He sighs, pulling his leg up to his chest and resting his chin on his knee. She raises a hand, something burning in the palm of it, and he reaches out to wrap his long fingers around her wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she says, voice cracking like the rest of her. \u201cThey\u2019ve caused nothing but trouble. If it hadn\u2019t been for the humans, Lucifer wouldn\u2019t have \u2013 we would still,\u201d she cuts herself off.</p>\n<p>Crowley thinks that if Lucifer died, it\u2019s because Lucifer chose to die. He fell and gave humans the world. When he gave Eve the power to choose, he gave her the power greater than that of an angel. When she bit the apple, she gave herself the knowledge of Her. So many choices, so many consequences, that it makes his head ache to think of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe died for them,\u201d he says instead of trying to talk through any of that mess, \u201cdon\u2019t let his death be in vain.\u201d</p>\n<p>The celestial fire goes out in the palm of her hand, and then she clasps her hands together in her lap, like that will hide their shaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey need a leader,\u201d she says, \u201cthe fallen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe my guest,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cAlthough it does appear to be that falling is a subjective thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s become a demon for doing as he\u2019s told. He doesn\u2019t understand. Why would She do this to him?</p>\n<p>\u201cI am to lead heaven,\u201d she says, \u201cand Lucifer was to lead hell. That was the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley can\u2019t help the swell of amusement at that. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like plans. Too many things to go wrong with them.\u201d If the last thing Lucifer ever did was thwart one of Her carefully laid plans \u2013 well, they can at least know he died laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHell needs a king,\u201d she insists.</p>\n<p>His temper flares. \u201cWell, why are you talking to me? Go support one of the dozen idiots jockeying for power down there. Why <em>are</em> you talking to me anyway? We\u2019re not supposed to be consorting with one another now.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hadn\u2019t really gotten on before, when he was still like her. He\u2019d just been a lowly angel with the ability to shift into a snake. Maybe he\u2019d been a snake first, before She had decided She needed another angel, he\u2019s not sure. He was Crawley, then Crowley, but really he was no one, and she was Michael, burning so bright and pure and sharp that even like this, on the edge of breaking, she's still the best of them.</p>\n<p>She reaches out and touches his hand. He flinches, expecting her touch to burn, but it doesn\u2019t. \u201cYou still have your wings. What other fallen has wings? You can still perform miracles, Crowley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly little ones,\u201d he says morosely. There\u2019ll be no parting of any seas for him, no cities dissolved to salt, none of that. Not that he\u2019d had any mind to do that to begin with, but he\u2019d like that he could have, if he wanted.</p>\n<p>She brushes her fingers against his cheek, and he has to resist the urge to lean into her touch. She feels warm. Sometimes he feels like he\u2019ll never be warm again. \u201cYou are not like the other fallen. If you go down there and make your bid for king, they will fall in line for you, they will obey you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be king,\u201d he insists. All he\u2019d ever wanted was this, his brothers at his side and Eden at his back. Alright, maybe a little more than that, an explanation or two, just some more insight into how it all worked, is all.</p>\n<p>He fell because of his thirst for knowledge, and so did Eve. The irony doesn\u2019t escape him, that he was the one to tell her of the apple. At least she got her answers. He just got thrown from his home with no explanation, as usual, no answers, no knowledge, no anything.</p>\n<p>Michael\u2019s grip on the back of his neck is tight enough that it\u2019s painful, but she\u2019s not looking at him anymore, instead staring out at the great expanse of earth that now belongs to men, and he just knows she\u2019s thinking of where in the clear blue sky her Lucifer burnt up, which part of the sky is the closest shade to the blue of his eyes, and does not take the pain personally. \u201cWe don\u2019t get what we want, Crowley. Take the throne. Lead them. Because if it\u2019s not you, it will be someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone worse, she doesn\u2019t say, but he hears it just fine anyway. The others didn\u2019t fall so much as jump, their wings burning and mouths screaming as they hurtled towards earth.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you just stand by and do nothing?\u201d she presses. \u201cAll it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a man,\u201d he says, because he isn\u2019t, no more than she\u2019s a woman or She\u2019s a woman or any of them are anything. But they\u2019re close enough, he supposes, in the grand scheme of things.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>good</em>,\u201d she insists, and tears prick his eyes at her conviction, at what should be an insult to him now.</p>\n<p>He tilts his head back, catching the sweet rain on his tongue, looking up at the clear blue sky.</p>\n<p>Lucifer had been good too, up until the end, he thinks, from his perspective and all. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019d fallen. He\u2019d loved Lucifer too much to hate him, and Michael is so good at hating, she\u2019s just better at loving, in the end.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI \u2013 okay. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Michael leans forward, pressing her lips to his forehead, and he closes his eyes at the sensation. \u201cGoodbye Crowley.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as easy as Michael said it would be. Of course it is. They\u2019re all rotting and wailing, skin lesions and the odor of decay impossible to escape. Then he shows up, wings perfectly intact if a darker hue, his skin clear, nothing to mark him as demonic but his eyes and the snake tattoo up the side of his face. He must be shining to them.</p>\n<p>Beelzebub presents him with a crown of onyx, dark and slick and shimmering in the light of hellfire. He lounges sidewise on his uncomfortable throne of iron and bows his head so that she may place it on him. It\u2019s cold against his skin. \u201cYou are my eyes,\u201d he declares, looking at her, \u201cyou are my ears, you are my mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>She brightens, if such a thing is possible in a place like this, with a being like her. He\u2019s the king of hell. But that doesn\u2019t mean he has to run the damn place himself.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not in hell often after that, but his crown remains as a phantom sensation, just as heavy as his halo used to be light. He thinks about it, and it\u2019s there, pressing against his skin, reminding him of his place just as surely as manacles around his wrists.</p>\n<p>The best thing is that he doesn\u2019t actually have to do much.</p>\n<p>He says he\u2019s topside to keep an eye on things, because if you want a job done properly, then you have to do it yourself. He doesn\u2019t commit murder or any other array of unspeakable horrors \u2013 no, he\u2019s their king, he has more important things to do. He is a heralder of wars, a bringer of sickness, temptation and sin swelling across the land.</p>\n<p>The most impressive things he\u2019s supposedly done have nothing to do with him at all, just humans being humans, just the result of too much sickness and not a deep enough understanding of hygiene. But what his dear disciples don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him.</p>\n<p>This is how he keeps running into Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>He keeps wondering if the angel will catch on, this kind, soft angel with a razor sharp edged who risked falling to give the humans a little bit of warmth. Crowley doesn\u2019t think Lucifer and Aziraphale ever met properly. If absolutely anything set Crowley apart from the other low level angels, it was simply that he had caught Lucifer\u2019s eye when the rest of them hadn\u2019t. He was far below even Aziraphale, no one would have ever thought to give him a flaming sword.</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t figure it out, they talk about quotas and head offices and Aziraphale keeps smiling at him even though he shouldn\u2019t, keeps coming to him and for him even though he shouldn\u2019t. He must not be able to see the crown around his head, must not be able to see the ways he\u2019s different from any other demon. Then again, demons and angels don\u2019t usually cross paths. That\u2019s why this is so unusual, him and Aziraphale running into each other over and over again.</p>\n<p>How many times before it\u2019s obviously not a coincidence? How many times can he get away with searching for an angel who loves books and smells like cotton candy and woodsmoke before it\u2019s no longer possible to pass it all off as a coincidence?</p>\n<p>Whatever that number is, he thinks they\u2019ve passed it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Crowley isn\u2019t expecting to run into another angel, never mind an archangel, and yet here she is, dark curly hair and olive skin, towering over him by a head and her deep brown eyes sightless.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d he says, \u201chave you come to drag me to hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what she does to miscreant demons, drags them kicking and screaming back downstairs, discorporates them so they have no choice but to hang around down there until Beelzebub can be assed to summon him so he can miracle them up a new body.</p>\n<p>She looks at him with her sightless eyes and asks, \u201cWhat good would it do me to drag a king back to his domain?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes dart around them, like Aziraphale is hovering around corners waiting to hear the secret that Crowley has been successfully keeping from him all these years. He isn\u2019t, of course. \u201cGot some holy water then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dying isn\u2019t all that appealing, but if the archangel Raquel has gotten it into her head to kill him, he\u2019s not sure he can stop her. He could make a bid of trying to summon Michael and hiding behind her, but he\u2019s not sure how much good it will do. She hates earth. He hasn\u2019t spoken to her since she convinced him to make a bid for the throne of hell.</p>\n<p>Actually, last he checked, every angel but one hated earth. \u201cWhat are you doing down here anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>She keeps looking at him, seeing him but not seeing him, and he shifts his weight from leg to the other. Her gaze is uncomfortable, because he doesn\u2019t know what he looks like to her, a demon or an angel, a king or a snake. He\u2019s all of them, and none of them, and sometimes it is exhausting to be nothing.</p>\n<p>Often, it is exhausting to be nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am the angel of justice,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I impart justice in heaven?\u201d It\u2019s not the truth, not really, and he doesn\u2019t even have to call her on it, just keeps staring at her until she turns away from him and says, \u201cI cannot find the way back to heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fallen?\u201d he demands, incredulous, because Lucifer was one thing, the impetuous, demanding morning star, but Raquel is \u2013 she\u2019s different, he\u2019d sooner see Michael fall than her.</p>\n<p>In the next second the breath has been knocked from his lungs and he\u2019s being pressed up against the wall, her divinity seeping through her skin, the heat of her touching him so intense that he fears she\u2019s burning him, but he\u2019s too scared to look away from her twisted face to check. \u201cI am not <em>fallen</em>, you pathetic, squirming, beast. How dare you \u2013 I would never \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, soft like he\u2019s talking to a wounded animal, a wounded human. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her grip loosens and she steps back. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry? You?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d he offers, wondering if it\u2019s a trick question, if she\u2019ll take offense at his sympathy and run him through with her sword. It\u2019s not wreathed in celestial fire, but it\u2019s still impressive.</p>\n<p>She snorts, then holds out her palm. In it materializes a scale, but it\u2019s not properly balanced. \u201cThese are the scales of justice. They unjust are too heavy. When it\u2019s even \u2013 when it\u2019s even again, I\u2019ll once more find my way to heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>She says it with the unshakable conviction of someone who speaks their truth based on faith alone. Crowley feels a stab of some emotion in the bottom of his chest. Not pity, because even he\u2019s not stupid enough to pity an archangel, but some soft sort of sorrow.</p>\n<p>Even if she\u2019s right, that\u2019s as good as being excommunicated. He likes humans, he likes how they\u2019re messy and bright and clever and interesting, but he\u2019s under no illusion about humanity. If it takes balance to get Raquel home, then she\u2019ll never again feel the warm light of heaven.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s not going to be the one to tell her that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and she smiles at him. It feels like he\u2019s lying to her, when he hasn\u2019t said anything untrue, hasn\u2019t said anything, really.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s really not cut out for this demon business.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think,\u201d Aziraphale begins, which is always a dreadful start to any meal, \u201cthat we all just cancel each other out? Not just you and me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley looks up at him, and he looks especially angelic like this, sitting in a warm beam of Roman sun. Like an angel, or a cat. \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean \u2013 if we\u2019re out here influencing things to be good, and your lot is influencing things to be bad, then aren\u2019t an awful lot of us canceling each other out? If that\u2019s true, we should just see who has more people, and declare them the winner of this game. I don\u2019t know how many demons or angels there are-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEight thousand five hundred and seven demons,\u201d he answers promptly.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale is staring at him, and he mentally review his answer. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, it\u2019s completely correct. If he\u2019s to keep track of his people, it would be nice to know who, exactly, those people are.</p>\n<p>Wait. Shit, right, but he\u2019s king, and surely Michael knows how many angels there are in heaven, but he\u2019s supposed to a be nobody, just another soldier in this ridiculous cold war. That\u2019s not information he should have on hand. Right?</p>\n<p>\u201cRoughly,\u201d he amends. \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have the exact answer on hand, because I\u2019m not ridiculous, but it is around eight thousand also,\u201d he says, apparently putting his curiosity about Crowley\u2019s specificity aside. \u201cIf it\u2019s just you doing one thing, and me doing another, that\u2019s one thing, but all of them, what\u2019s the big deal, why are we even here, what do we gain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that straight forward, angel,\u201d he says, and Aziraphale looks so distressed that he has to squash down on the urge to do something nice. \u201cWe don\u2019t go around just causing evil, that would be ridiculous, although perhaps more cost effective in the long run. We just \u2013 we tempt is all. We offer a choice. It\u2019s not on us if they choose wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t wrong choices what got us here to being with?\u201d Aziraphale asks, and in this moment he looks his age, he is like Atlas, he is like Her son, bearing the weight of humanity\u2019s sins but finding them too heavy to bear.</p>\n<p>Crowley clears his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s not too bad a place to be, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looks up, and his mouth quirks up in the corners, and just like that all that weight is gone. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bodies are such insufficient things, as much as he loves his, but in this moment he feels his loss more keenly than normal. He wants to do more than touch Aziraphale, he wants to curl their atoms together, wants to dance with him in the starlight of unknown galaxies, wants to be air in his lungs and exist in and around him and next to him all at once.</p>\n<p>But this is earth, and he can do none of that here, so he raises his cup of wine and drinks deeply.</p>\n<p>They keep meeting in Rome. He wonders if all roads still lead here, or it\u2019s just Aziraphale\u2019s love of oysters that keeps leading Crowley here, and what the difference is, in the end. Perhaps, for him, all roads simply lead to Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>He laughs, and won\u2019t explain why when his angel asks, just keeps drinking and smiling.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0He does the math once, and math isn\u2019t one of his favorite things, but he spends hours downstairs, in the basement of hell where they keep all the infernal paperwork, his oil slick crown tipping forward as he bends his head over ledgers and adds it all up.</p>\n<p>Heaven has killed more people than hell. There\u2019s more blood on the hands of angels than that of demons, and he wonders if that says something about heaven and all its supposed cleanliness, or it says something about him as a king and the general intelligence of his demons.</p>\n<p>He decides that it means demons aren\u2019t the best at bookkeeping, because everything else is too depressing to contemplate.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Crowley doesn\u2019t usually get summoned by or called on by anyone but Beelzebub. Everyone else is too afraid of him, too wary, their distant king who seems to so casually start wars and collapse nations while they run around trying to tempt individuals to do dastardly deeds.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all a lie, but they don\u2019t know that.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s frightening us,\u201d Hastur whispers, head bent to the ground, \u201cshe\u2019s - you gotta do something, Sir. She\u2019s tearin\u2019 us all apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, okay, like he\u2019s stupid enough to go and confront an insane archangel. He doesn\u2019t care how many new bodies he has to make them, it\u2019s better than getting torn apart himself. He opens his mouth to say just that, but one looks at Hastur\u2019s face and it dies in his throat.</p>\n<p>He looks hopeful. He hadn\u2019t thought his subjects knew what hope was. How can he deny that, it\u2019s positive reinforcement, right? His demons show some humanity, and he rewards them for it, so maybe they\u2019ll show some more, maybe one day he won\u2019t feel so disgusted and different and apart from all those he commands.</p>\n<p>Did She feel this way about them? If so, it\u2019s a miracle She didn\u2019t send them all tumbling down into hell, how She tolerated a single angel in Her domain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, and he reaches out for Hastur\u2019s bent head. He flinches away from the touch, but Crowley just brushes his fingers through his hair, uncaring of the rotted flesh and maggots between his fingers.</p>\n<p>Did they all look at Her like Hastur is looking at him right now? If they did, well, that answers that, at least.</p>\n<p>He finds her in the middle of a desert and has to push his way through a sandstorm to get to her. At first he thinks that ringing in his ears is because of the wind, but he gets closer and realizes it\u2019s her screaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, all his curses and thousands of languages failing him as he steps into the eye of the storm.</p>\n<p>The first thing he notices is her eyes. They\u2019re not just blind, they\u2019re gone, two bloody holes in her face, dark and cavernous. Her body is too thin and covered in sores, like she\u2019s rotting from the inside out, her chest heaves with sobs, and there are no tears for her now, not without any eyes.</p>\n<p>He should run. She\u2019s an archangel, even like this his powers are nothing to hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cRaquel!\u201d he shouts, and she doesn\u2019t hear him. He sighs, stepping closer, and it isn\u2019t until he reaches for her shoulder and feels the hot slickness of blood and exposed flesh that he realizes. His stomach lurches, and he has to close his eyes and breathe deeply to keep from vomiting all over her, which he feels wouldn\u2019t help the situation at all.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s cut off her wings.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d tumbles out his mouth before he can stop it, and he winces, wishing he could take it back, swallow those words back down.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t matter, because she doesn\u2019t hear him even still, and he grips her shoulder, ignoring the gut rolling sensation of sinking his fingers into her muscles, and yanks her close, pulling her against him and tucking her head under his chin so he can wrap her in his arms. He snaps his wings open. They\u2019re just as large and healthy as they were when he was an angel, it\u2019s only that they\u2019re an inky blue-black now, and he curves them around her, blocking out the light and sand, making the universe smaller, until it fits just the two of them.</p>\n<p>She stops screaming, taking in a long, gasping breath like she\u2019s forgotten to breathe, and he says, \u201cStop, please, please stop, you\u2019ve - just stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t go home,\u201d she wails, twisting her fingers in the material of his shirt. \u201cI try and I try and it never balances, it\u2019s always tipped too far and I can\u2019t - I can\u2019t.\u201d She pulls back enough to tilt her head up towards him, so he\u2019s forced to look into the gaping holes where her eyes should be. \u201cKill me. Please, you - you have to. You\u2019re the only one who can, you\u2019re King, only you can summon hellfire hot enough to burn me up. Please. I\u2019ve never begged before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispers, reaching up a hand to cup her face. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, don\u2019t beg. You are Raquel, an archangel of heaven, the angel of justice. You submit yourself to Her and to Her alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me,\u201d she sobs, \u201cand what good am I without Her, what\u2019s the point of me? None at all. Kill me. Do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leans down to press a kiss to her cheek, ignoring the taste of iron blood on his lips, and she collapses, dead weight in his arms.</p>\n<p>The wind storm subsides. He unfolds his wings, pulling them back inside his body and bends down to pick her up, an arm around her back and under her knees so he can hold her to his chest.</p>\n<p>Her breathing is ragged even under a sleeping spell, her fingers twitching. She can\u2019t find rest, even with a miracle. He swallows, closing his eyes, and forcing it all down. They can\u2019t both fall apart. There won\u2019t be anyone to pick up the pieces.</p>\n<p>He takes her home and cleans her of the blood and sand. He\u2019s no healer, not really, but he knows how celestial bodies work, he\u2019s made thousands for his demons throughout the year, and she\u2019s no demon, but it\u2019s not hard for him to press his hands against the sores on her body and miracle them gone, to heal her earthly container if not the soul within.</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t bring back her wings.</p>\n<p>He tries, plucks feathers from his own and tries to build a new set out of them, figuring even black wings are better than none, but wings are their gift from Her, and he may be a king, but he\u2019s not a god, so he can\u2019t replace them. He dresses her in a soft white dress favored by the current Greeks, all draping material, but hesitates over her eyes.</p>\n<p>Her blindness was also a gift from Her, all the things she could and couldn\u2019t see passed down from the Almighty. He can\u2019t replace that. But he traces his fingertips along the corner of her eye sockets, trying to will eyes into their place, to at least give her something besides emptiness.</p>\n<p>It only makes her start bleeding anew, so he stops, wrapping bandages around her eyes and tying it off behind her head, unable to stop the wave of sorrow at seeing the blood seeping through the white cloth. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmurs.</p>\n<p>She sleeps for three days. He stays by her bedside the whole time, too terrified to leave unless she wakes up while he\u2019s gone and does something terrible. When she does stir, he reaches for her hands, pressing both of them in between his own, and she stills. \u201cYou know,\u201d she croaks, her throat still rusty from all the sand and screaming, \u201cyou\u2019re rather terrible at being a demon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was terrible at being an angel too,\u201d he says, even though he\u2019d always thought he was rather good at it. But that can\u2019t be true, because if it was he wouldn\u2019t be here.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he would. He\u2019d thought Raquel was good at being an angel too, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d she asks, turning her body towards him, \u201cHow do I fix them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Demons shouldn\u2019t have hearts, it\u2019s just not fair, because he feels a crack go right through the middle of his. \u201cYou can\u2019t. You can\u2019t balance the sins of humanity, you can only forgive them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does a demon know of forgiveness?\u201d she asks, but it\u2019s not cutting or cruel this time, it\u2019s teasing, like they\u2019re in on the same joke. Because she\u2019s an angel of justice, and forgiveness has no place in that, forgiveness is something softer, and Raquel is not soft.</p>\n<p>Even still, he can\u2019t keep the exhaustion from his voice when he answers, \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later, she walks through the streets like that, always carrying her sword and her scale, and soon he hears a different name on the winds, one that\u2019s given to her by the people rather than Her.</p>\n<p>They call her Lady Justice. She doesn\u2019t forgive, but people go to her, looking for answers, for truth, looking to get what they deserve.</p>\n<p>And she gives it to them.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t keep track of how much blood her sword has spilled. She is justice, not mercy.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Aziraphale asks, the chessboard nearly forgotten between them. \u201cYou\u2019ve seemed \u2026 off, recently. Is it the plague? Do your superiors suspect something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he assures, \u201ceveryone thinks the black plague is my doing.\u201d It\u2019s the rats\u2019 doing, but he\u2019s been taking credit for the folly of man for thousands of years, it seems only right that he start stealing the glory from rats as well.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale shifts in his seat. His eyes are piercing and far too knowing. Not that knowing, though, of course. No matter how piercing his gaze, there\u2019s one very big secret that Crowley\u2019s been playing close to his chest for years. \u201cWell, something\u2019s bothering you. You\u2019ve been different.\u201d</p>\n<p>His instinct is to make a joke, to change the subject. to say something glib and distracting. Instead what tumbles out his mouth is, \u201cDo you think we would have known each other, if I hadn\u2019t fallen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Did he really just say that out loud? Fuck, the ground should open up and swallow him whole to put him out of his misery. He\u2019s the king of hell, that should be something that he can arrange for himself.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale doesn\u2019t even blink, mouth parted in surprise. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Crowley says desperately, \u201cnever mind, it\u2019s a ridiculous thought. We wouldn\u2019t have, of course, I was just a foot soldier and you were \u2013 you were given a flaming sword and given the duty of guarding Eden, our paths wouldn\u2019t have even crossed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou crossed paths with Lucifer,\u201d Aziraphale says, and Crowley freezes. How does he know that? Why did he know that? \u201cHe plucked you out from the others. He thought you were funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am funny,\u201d he says, mouth numb, because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say, what sort of response he\u2019s supposed to have to that.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery time we saw you with him, it would drive everyone to distraction,\u201d he continues, like he doesn\u2019t know what his words are doing to him. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t understand it, what the shining morning star was doing with you, why he shunned our company but sought out yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>He swallows to wet his mouth then says, \u201cRecruitment strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale says immediately, \u201cno, it wasn\u2019t that, there were plenty of angels who followed Lucifer down who hadn\u2019t met him personally. But not you. You knew him.\u201d</p>\n<p>If he\u2019s looking for an explanation, Crowley doesn\u2019t have one. \u201cI just \u2013 he \u2013 we got along, is all.\u201d Lucifer shined as bright as a thousand suns, and Crowley wasn\u2019t just in his shadow, because they were all in his shadow, but Crowley was a shadow, dark and forgotten and defined by what stood before him. But Lucifer had been sad too, in quiet moments, and Michael could not be there always, a million things needing her attention. So in those moments there was Crowley. He assumed Lucifer only let him see his pain because he wasn\u2019t important enough to hide it from, like breaking down in front of the family dog.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale breaches the distance between them, gripping Crowley\u2019s forearm, the heat of his divinity sinking into Crowley\u2019s skin. \u201cI would have noticed you, we\u2019d have know each other. Even if Lucifer had never noticed you, I would have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or wishful thinking, but either way it makes him smile.</p>\n<p>Later, he\u2019s sitting by the river, the phantom weight of Aziraphale\u2019s hand making his whole arm tingle. He thinks of his crown, and it\u2019s on his head, the physical manifestation something he can summon and dismiss even if its weight is something he\u2019s never without.</p>\n<p>All at once, he\u2019s swept up in rage, in a thousand what ifs. What if he hadn\u2019t fallen, what if he\u2019d never met Lucifer, what if he hadn\u2019t done as Michael asked, what if he was just a regular demon, what if he wasn\u2019t king, what if he was free to give himself away instead of belonging to eight thousand five hundred and seven demons.</p>\n<p>He screams as he hurls his shimmering black crown into the river, wishing it was as easy to toss of the mantel of king, whishing he could grip Aziraphale as tightly as he wanted to without consequences, but knowing that he can\u2019t, not like this, not as he is now.</p>\n<p>His crown sinks into the river, then does something unexpected. It dissolves into the water, oil slick floating on top of the river and killing everything it touches.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d he says, suddenly bone deep tired, \u201cit seems I\u2019ve created pollution.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, at least, he won\u2019t have to lie about his demons about his misdeeds.</p>\n<p>He prefers it when he has to lie.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Over six thousand years since he\u2019s seen her last, Michael appears before him.</p>\n<p>He wishes he\u2019d had a little forewarning, if only so he wasn\u2019t in sweatpants eating cinnamon toast crunch straight from the box. \u201cSHIT!\u201d he shouts, falling sidewise off the couch. When he stands up, he\u2019s fully clothed in a black suit and his signature sunglasses. \u201cHello Michael dear, long time no see. Are you here to kill me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He wants to say she looks exactly the same, but that\u2019s not quite right, if she didn\u2019t look so much like herself he wouldn\u2019t even be able to recognize her.</p>\n<p>The cracks he\u2019d seen in her thousands of years ago have widened into caverns. For a moment, he wishes he\u2019d remained in heaven for purely unselfish reasons, because he never would have let her get like this, eyes too blue and something (someone) clearly missing from what she used to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, still looking at him. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime,\u201d he repeats, uncertain. \u201cTime for what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArmageddon.\u201d</p>\n<p>His stomach drops. It\u2019s been six thousand years, which is so long, but not nearly long enough. Already? So soon? It still seems like humanity is so young, like they\u2019ve barely learned to stand on their own two legs, and already it\u2019s supposed to be the end of the all of them. It\u2019s not fair.</p>\n<p>He clears his throat. \u201cWell, uh. Thanks for the heads up.\u201d</p>\n<p>She keeps looking at him, and it makes his shoulder blades itch, right where his wings would be if he had them out. \u201cYou misunderstand. It\u2019s time for you to start Armageddon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d he says, and he\u2019ll deny that that came out as a squeak. \u201cWhat do you mean, what do I have to do with\u2013\u201d Oh, wait. Right. Why has he never thought of this before? <em>Fuck</em> Michael, if she\u2019d mentioned this bit when she was trying to sell him on the whole king of hell bit he never would have done it. Which is probably why she hadn\u2019t, actually.</p>\n<p>\u201cChoose wisely,\u201d she says, and then she\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>His first thought is Beelzebub, but he dismisses it almost as soon as he has it. No other demon will do.</p>\n<p>Truly, he knows deep down, that who he truly wants is Aziraphale. But he doesn\u2019t know the truth, and even if he did, it\u2019s not fair to drag him into this mess just because he \u2013 just because. Besides, he\u2019s currently man-shaped, and that won\u2019t do either. But just because his angel is off the table doesn\u2019t mean all angels are.</p>\n<p>He finds her in America, wearing judge\u2019s robes. Changing with the times, and all that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your scale?\u201d he asks, sitting on the edge of her desk. She has a gavel, but no scale.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t startle or act surprised, her hands don\u2019t even pause in reading the braille case report in front of her. \u201cI must have misplaced it. What do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a more complicated question than she thinks, probably. Or it\u2019s exactly as complicated as she thinks, and she just likes making his life miserable. It\u2019s probably the latter. \u201cI \u2013 Michael came to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now he has her attention. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the end of the world.\u201d The words taste like ash on his tongue. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take her long to figure it out, and then she\u2019s laughing. \u201cShould I be flattered, or insulted?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just following orders!\u201d he exclaims, and he won\u2019t blush over his, he\u2019s an ancient demon, he doesn\u2019t blush.</p>\n<p>She stands, pressing herself close to him, and has to resist the urge to lean back, to lean away from her. \u201cJust what every girl wants to hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a girl,\u201d he says, but opens his legs so that she can step between them, so she can grip the front of shirt and pop the buttons off one by one.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not a man,\u201d she returns, and then she\u2019s kissing him before he can respond. They\u2019re man and woman enough for this, at least. They somehow end up in her giant bed in her high rise apartment, the walls all glass, her sword mounted above the bed. She scratches her nails down his back until he relents and lets out his wings, so big that they drag over both sides of the bed. She flips them over, and considering his wings don\u2019t get bent or broken in the process, it definitely involves some sort of miracle. He spreads his wings for her as she spreads her legs, sinking down on top of him as he rises up to meet her. He doesn\u2019t do this often, not like this, and he wants this to be good for her, he wants something to be good for her after thousands of years of her life being a constant string of not-good-enough. He holds himself back until she\u2019s shaking around him, a cry high in the back of her throat that\u2019s as sweet as an angelic chorus, and then he\u2019s spilling inside her, breath leaving him all at once as he grips her hips to keep himself steady.</p>\n<p>After, she lies on top of his chest, and he curls his wings around them, his soft black feathers against their naked bodies, keeping her warmer than any blanket ever could.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stick around,\u201d Raquel murmurs into his collarbone, which seems rather at odds with the way she\u2019s sprawled on top of him. \u201cI\u2019ll just get sick of your hovering. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll let you know what the child is born.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. He hadn\u2019t thought of that, of what it would be like for her while their child grows beneath her heart. \u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t mind.\u201d It seems wrong to just leave her to the growing pains and the miserable mornings and sleepless nights.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says firmly, and it seems just as wrong to argue with her, so he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll see you in nine months, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughs, tilts her head up to brush her lips against his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re no god, and I\u2019m no Mother Mary. If I\u2019m to deliver the end of times, I\u2019ll need more than that. Nine years should do it, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYears?\u201d he demands, horrified. It should be a respite, nine extra years before the end of all he holds dear, but instead he just feels horribly guilty. He hadn\u2019t known, when he\u2019d asked, exactly he was asking for. \u00a0</p>\n<p>She kisses him properly then, more as a way to soothe him than out of any real desire, and says, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stay completely away, of course. He checks in on her, makes sure her cabinets are always filled with crackers and ginger ale, miracles her hot water bottles to stay warm, heals soreness and tired muscles as soon as he notices them.</p>\n<p>Five years in he can\u2019t help himself. She\u2019s round with their child, and she sleeps on her side, breathing softly as he stands next to her bed, itching to touch, to feel, but trying to not be a huge asshole about it. Watching her face, he kneels on the edge of the bed and reaches out a hand, carefully pressing it to the taut skin of her belly.</p>\n<p>Almost as soon as he touches her, there\u2019s a kick against his hand, then another, his child reaching for him. He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s crying until Raquel\u2019s hand cups his cheek, using her thumb to wipe his tears away. He looks down into where her eyes should be, and he hadn\u2019t even noticed her waking up. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, \u201cI broke the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you are a demon, after all,\u201d she sighs. \u201cCome on, just for tonight. Then you go back to hovering in the background where I can pretend you\u2019re not there.\u201d Of course she\u2019d known what he was doing the entire time.</p>\n<p>She tugs him down, and he lies down beside her, tucking his knees against hers and sliding his arm under her neck, his head above hers. She takes his other hand and places it against her stomach, sighing as their child continues to reach for him. \u201cGoodnight Crowley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight Raquel,\u201d he whispers, and pretends he\u2019s not holding the end of the world in his arms.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He\u2019s eating sushi with Aziraphale in Osaka, and his best friend is halfway through a hilarious story about having to report into Uriel, and Crowley has to swallow his bit of sashimi before he bursts out laughing and sends a spray of rice all over their table, because then they\u2019ll never be able to come back and Aziraphale will be cross with him, which is the last thing he wants.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when he feels it. A swift, sharp pain along his lower abdomen, and he knows exactly what it means.</p>\n<p>He stands so quickly that his chair falls back behind him, and Aziraphale\u2019s face has quickly shifted to alarm. \u201cWhat \u2013 are you hurt \u2013 is everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he says, groping for some sort of explanation but coming up blank. \u201cI\u2019m being summoned.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which Aziraphale will interpret as being summoned by his head office, and that will just have to do. He grabs Aziraphale by the lapels of his jacket and jerks him forward, kissing him once on both cheeks before he disappears into a puff of smoke. He\u2019ll have to pay for that later, but right at this moment he can\u2019t bring himself to care.</p>\n<p>Raquel is pacing, hands spread over her stomach, red faced and panting. \u201cNow?\u201d he asks when he sees her, even though the answer is rather obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d she says, and then bites off a groan as another contraction hits.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s generally useless, as he imagines most partners are at these things. There\u2019s not a midwife for this, no one to call, because this has never been done before, never happened before.</p>\n<p>An archangel is giving birth to the child of the king of hell. The antichrist, in purely clinical terms, although of course Crowley can\u2019t think of it like that, can\u2019t think of his child like that.</p>\n<p>She curses and screams, threatens to tear open her belly and pull the child from it, even though they both know that won\u2019t work, not with this baby. He tries to leech her pain away, but of course he can\u2019t, because her pain is part of the process, so he pushes her hair away from her sweaty brow and lets her break the bones in his hand, doesn\u2019t flinch and brings their joined hands up to his face so he can kiss her wrist. It takes longer than he thinks it should, but he\u2019s no expert at these things, hours of pushing to bring their child into the world. He kneels between her legs and cradles the baby\u2019s neck, providing support as Raquel gives a strangled cry and one last final push, and their child slips into the world, and then he\u2019s holding their son in his arms.</p>\n<p>Raquel groans as she pushes the afterbirth out, but that comes easily, and Crowley cleans the area around their son\u2019s eyes, cradling him against his chest, and he\u2019s crying, his tears falling\u00a0onto the baby\u2019s face until he thinks to turn away. He\u2019s perfect, ten fingers and toes, and then he opens his eyes, and its Raquel\u2019s rich brown eyes staring up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello darling,\u201d he whispers. His son isn\u2019t crying, but he\u2019s alert and breathing, just as perfect as Her son was when he took his first breath in Bethlehem.</p>\n<p>He goes to the side of the bed, where Raquel lies exhausted, tacky sweat on her skin and bed soaked with blood and other such things. He moves to place their son her chest, to let her hold the being she spend nine long years creating in her body, but she flinches and turns away from him. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He freezes, confused. \u201cDo you want me to clean him first?\u201d As soon as he\u2019s said it, it\u2019s done, their son soft and warm, his skin clear. He has dark hair, just like mother\u2019s, and it sticks up with the after effects of his miracle.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust - don\u2019t,\u201d she says, closing her eyes, like she can\u2019t bear to look at him. Crowley doesn\u2019t understand. He\u2019s not an ugly baby, just the opposite in fact, even though he knows he\u2019s rather biased. \u201cTake him away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even want to hold him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d she asks, \u201cWe can\u2019t keep him. He doesn\u2019t belong to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, there it is, that very human sensation he feels sometimes. It\u2019s his heart breaking. \u201cI - but - no, you\u2019re right, but before - not even for a moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be easier, for me,\u201d she says, \u201cif I don\u2019t have the sensation of him in my arms to miss. Please, Crowley. Just go.\u201d</p>\n<p>How can he argue with that? With her, of all people? He can\u2019t. So he sighs and leans down to press a kiss to her forehead, wrapping a miracle around her, cleaning her and her bed, repairing the physical damage carrying the end of the world has wrought upon her body.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting in his car, his baby tipped against his chest. He looks down at him, brushing a thumb against his soft cheek and lets him grab his finger and hold on, looks into his eyes, and when the sob crawls its way up from his chest, he\u2019s not surprised.</p>\n<p>There is exactly three hours and seventeen minutes until the American ambassador\u2019s wife is set to arrive at the church of the satanic nuns.</p>\n<p>That means he has three hours and sixteen minutes to hold his son, to kiss him and listen to his heart beat, until he has to let him go.</p>\n<p>Three hours and fifteen minutes later he wipes the tears from his eyes, puts on his sunglasses, and miracles up a bassinet for his son. Handing him over isn\u2019t the hardest thing he\u2019s had to do, surely, he\u2019s never wanted to be a father, doesn\u2019t know what one does with human children, really, and he\u2019s fallen from heaven, how can handing a nun a basket compare with that.</p>\n<p>But it does, and he\u2019s not as surprised as he thought he\u2019d be to discover he\u2019d fall another hundred times if it meant getting to keep that child, and it floors him, a little, but it shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He fell half in love with Aziraphale that day in the garden, of course loving his son comes even easier, overcomes him a totality as final as holy water on his skin.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the end of the world, and he\u2019s just given his son away.</p>\n<p>It seems, then, that the only thing to do is to get roaringly piss drunk.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>He\u2019d glad he doesn\u2019t have to think of a lie to tell his favorite angel, since Aziraphale assumes the reason he ran off so quickly is that he was summoned to deliver the antichrist. Which is technically true, in a very literal sense. When Aziraphale suggests they keep an eye on the child, he should refuse, should insist that they just leave it up to his nature. Which doesn\u2019t make much sense to him to begin with, because surely his nature can\u2019t be all evil, can it? He\u2019s the son of the archangel of justice, after all.</p>\n<p>But when faced with the opportunity to watch his son grow up, how can he say no? They argue about it for a bit it, poking about logistics and boundaries and other such things, and it\u2019s not until a year later that they start to insinuate themselves into the American ambassador\u2019s house, Aziraphale as a gardener, and Crowley as a nanny. It would have been safer for him to be the gardener, and he\u2019s the one with experience terrifying plants into submission, after all, and less direct contact with the child he\u2019s not supposed to see in the first place, but he can\u2019t resist.</p>\n<p>Except that the moment he sees the baby called Warlock, he knows.</p>\n<p>This is not the baby Raquel bore, not the child he held in his arms as he wept, not his son. If he was just a demon, maybe he wouldn\u2019t know any better, because he\u2019s supposed to be human for now, supposed to have no powers or anything different than any other baby on this earth. But he looks into his eyes and knows, because those aren\u2019t Raquel\u2019s eyes, aren\u2019t his mother\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d the ambassador asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley says, \u201cno, of course not, he\u2019s a lovely child.\u201d He\u2019s just not <em>his</em> child.</p>\n<p>He slips away as soon as he can, going back to the satanic nuns, and he thinks he\u2019s calm, he\u2019s so sure he\u2019s calm.</p>\n<p>But they see him and scream, falling to their knees, and it takes him a moment to realize.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s surrounded in hellfire, a crown of fire atop his head, marking him as more than simply Master Crowley, a fellow servant, but as their lord, their king. He tips down his sunglasses, knowing that there\u2019s fire in his snake eyes too, and asks, \u201cWhat have you done to my son?\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take too long to get the truth out them.</p>\n<p>Tadfield, is it?</p>\n<p>He slips through the cracks of this middle class suburban home, until he\u2019s in the nursery, half smoke as he hovers over the crib.</p>\n<p>Oh. There he is.</p>\n<p>He sees the kitschy blocks painted on the wall, spelling out a name, and he smiles as he leans over the crib and says, \u201cHello Adam. This is where you\u2019ve gotten off too.\u201d</p>\n<p>His son coos and grasps for him, tiny arms outstretched, and Crowley smiles as he reaches for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney?\u201d a feminine voice calls out, \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley leaves before he can get caught, but aches with the missed opportunity, and feels some sort of twisted satisfaction when Adam starts crying and reaching for the place where he was instead of Mrs. Young, trying to get to him just as a little baby in his crib.</p>\n<p>He waits until the sun has set, until the Youngs are asleep, and then creeps back inside the house, creeps back into the nursery to look down at his baby. \u201cAdam\u2019s a good name. I did like that fellow, the first one, you know.\u201d He stirs, making a soft wuffling sound, and then his eyes slowly blink open. His mouth splits into a grin, and he reaches for him once more, and this time Crowley doesn\u2019t hesitate, scooping him out of the crib and to his chest, pressing his nose to his son\u2019s head and just breathing.</p>\n<p>Before having a son, he never used to cry so much.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The right thing to do, the proper thing, the thing he should do, is tell Aziraphale that they have the wrong baby, that the son of the ambassador is just a normal human and they\u2019re wasting their time by playing nursemaid to what will undoubtably grow up to be a deeply unremarkable human.</p>\n<p>The Youngs are relieved that their baby starts sleeping through the night, because he\u2019d begun to get rather too old to keep waking them up, and in fact Mrs. Young boasts sometimes she can even sleep in, with her baby content to wait until she\u2019s blearily sipped at her first cup of coffee before making a fuss.</p>\n<p>Crowley just rolls his eyes whenever he overhears this during his spying, because that\u2019s not exactly the case.</p>\n<p>Every night he slips into his son\u2019s room, sits in that ridiculous rocking chair, and holds him. Adam sleeps against his chest, and Crowley feeds him if he wakes up hungry, or plays with him if he\u2019s bored, and tells him stories, about so many things, about all the wonderous things he\u2019s experienced on this earth, tells him about Aziraphale and his bookshop, says how much he\u2019d like to take him there.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t try to impart any grand lessons or anything like that. Maybe he will, later, but he\u2019s not sure what the point of it is. If it\u2019s not Adam, it\u2019ll be another, if Crowley is killed another king will take his place, and another child will be born.</p>\n<p>Maybe that would have been the right thing to do. To die, and refuse to be the one that started the end of the world, to not drag Raquel into this mess, to not have a son who\u2019s unknowingly burdened with a terrible destiny. But he didn\u2019t die, and he did have a son, and they only have about nine years left until the end of the world.</p>\n<p>When Adam starts talking properly, Crowley knows he needs another strategy. For six miserable months he doesn\u2019t visit his son at night, just watches, and tries not to hate himself whenever Adam wakes in the middle of the night and is so disappointed to find himself alone.</p>\n<p>He buys a house in Tadfield. Not just any house, in fact, but the one right next to the Youngs. He\u2019s stupid, and this is all stupid, he should just leave well enough alone, but he can\u2019t. He introduces himself to the neighbors, quick and efficient and not something he\u2019s ever done before, up until he gets to the Youngs.</p>\n<p>He puts on his best smile and talks about how he travels for work so much, but he wanted to move someplace quiet, and this just seemed like a perfect place, and all of that. Mr. Young is friendly and welcomes him to the neighborhood, and then Mrs. Young walks in with Adam on her hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cMine!\u201d he screams, grinning, kicking at his mother and pushing her away. \u201cMine, mine, mine!\u201d</p>\n<p>Startled, Mrs. Young puts him down, and then he\u2019s running forward on shaky legs, and Crowley bends at the knee before he can think better of it, sweeping him up in his arms. Adam grins and starts babbling at him, and Crowley can\u2019t keep the smile off his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dear!\u201d Mrs. Young says. \u201cHe\u2019s never acted like this before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with him,\u201d Mr. Young says, and Crowley tries not to feel guilty at the hint of jealousy in his words. Mr. Young loves his son, he\u2019s just not very good at the emotional bits of it all. \u201cDo you have kids?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, and sadness threatens to cripple him, \u201cno, not really, not \u2013 I had a son,\u201d which is more than he was planning on saying, actually. \u201cBut I lost him, just \u2013 just a few hours after he was born. He\u2019d be about this age.\u201d Mrs. Young looks devastated on his behalf, while Mr. Young is supremely uncomfortable, which is how he best expresses his sympathy. \u201cLet me know if you need a sitter, yeah? I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mrs. Young assures him they will, and he means to leave, but Adam won\u2019t let go of him, and he ends up staying for lunch with Adam in his lap. He can be charming when he wants to be, and he does his best to charm the Youngs, knows that access to his son depends on how much these two like him, so he tries very, very hard to be likeable.</p>\n<p>He gets asked to babysit the very next weekend.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Aziraphale asks him, mouth turned down at the corners. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so busy lately. I feel like I hardly ever see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which isn\u2019t precisely true, but certainly they\u2019re seeing each other less. But it\u2019s hard, to be in Tadfield enough to be known as the strange and eccentric neighbor, and he can along be away so long on a supposed business trip before he has to go back to making daily appearances.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust busy, lots of things coming from the head office. It is the end of the world, after all.\u201d He\u2019s not good at lying, not to Aziraphale, never has been, never will be. But he does it, because he can\u2019t tell him the truth. He must be okay at it, at least, since his best friend still doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s the king of hell. Maybe he\u2019s only good at lying about the big things, the type of things that Aziraphale doesn\u2019t think to question.</p>\n<p>He keeps looking at him, then says, \u201cWell, alright then. Do let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo help Hell take over the world?\u201d he asks sarcastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo make it easier on you,\u201d he answers, steady as he always is, and Adam is five years old, they only have six years of all this left, and it\u2019s such a struggle, being pulled between Aziraphale, whom he loves, and Adam, whom he also loves.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s had six thousand years with his angel, and he only gets eleven years of stolen moments with his son, so. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Crowley! Mr. Crowley, Mum said you were back, I know you\u2019re in there!\u201d Adam shouts, and Crowley\u2019s already smiling as he opens his door. There\u2019s his son, standing there with his little gang of friends, the Them. In the mid afternoon sun, his hair has a reddish tinge, and he got that from Crowley.</p>\n<p>He frowns. \u201cHave you gotten taller since I saw you last? What did I say about growing up when I wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d He\u2019s nine now, they\u2019re so close to the end of all things.</p>\n<p>Adam grins, reaching for his hand tugging at it, pulling him out of his house. \u201cI want to go berry picking!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes everyone want to go berry picking?\u201d he asks. Wensley makes a so-so gesture with his hand and Pepper shakes her head. Brian, at least, nods his head enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>Adam tugs on him again, \u201cCome on, Mum and Dad said we could go if you go with us, you will, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he answers, running a hand through Adam\u2019s hair. \u201cCome on, we can see if we can make some sort of muffin or cake out of them after, hm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very bad at baking,\u201d Pepper points out, because he is.</p>\n<p>He grins and shrugs, letting Adam pull him away, the Them hurrying to keep pace. \u201cI won\u2019t get better at it by not doing it, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut at the expense of the berries?\u201d Brian mutters, distressed, and Crowley can\u2019t help but laugh.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The years pass too quickly, quicker than he thought time could pass. Adam comes knocking on his door more often than not, and he does his best to be there when he does. He goes to his school plays and helps him with his homework. When Adam gets a miserable cold that lays out Mrs. Young as well, he goes over and takes care of them both, lets Adam curl miserable and fever-sick into his lap, and pushes his sweaty hair off of his forehead. When Adam\u2019s being particularly difficult, Crowley is there, with an inhuman patience neither of his other parents have. They should try being king of hell, it\u2019s an excellent primer for a child\u2019s temper tantrum, and even at Adam\u2019s worst, at his most surely and cranky and difficult, Crowley still loves him so much that he thinks his heart will burst from his chest.</p>\n<p>Then it\u2019s time to pick out a hellhound and release it, for Adam to start coming into his powers. When he names it Dog, and this vicious, powerful beast becomes a boy\u2019s loving companion, Crowley just laughs, and couldn\u2019t be prouder of Adam if he tried. He ends up cajoling Mr. Young into letting him keep it, saying it\u2019ll teach him responsibility and character, and all that.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is also when Aziraphale figures out they\u2019ve been hanging around the wrong boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he assures him, even though they won\u2019t, of course. Crowley had wiped that night and his visit from the minds of all the nuns, and now he\u2019s the only one that knows the truth.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looks really, properly worried, and Crowley feels like an absolute heel, but he can\u2019t risk it, won\u2019t risk his son, not for anyone, not even his angel.</p>\n<p>He tries to pull Adam back when he runs into that witch that Crowley had literally run into with his car, but she fills his mind with all sorts of things, and because his mind is a powerful thing, those sort of things start appearing all over. It\u2019s around this time that Aziraphale figures out where Adam is, exactly, and then Crowley has to run circles around everyone to keep all his secrets in place. Although, at this point, he doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s bothering, since it\u2019ll all be over in a couple days anyway.</p>\n<p>None of it does matter, in the end. They\u2019re all standing there, Shadwell and his woman, the four horsemen, Aziraphale, the Them, Michael, and Beelzebub. Adam has overcome the tug of his hellish powers, and Crowley didn\u2019t know that was something he could do, that it was even possible, but perhaps he should have known better, should have known his son would be extraordinary, even among the impossible.</p>\n<p>He could have probably snapped him out of it, but he thinks it\u2019s better this way, that it was his human friends that mattered more than all that power, in the end.</p>\n<p>Still, what he can\u2019t help focusing on is the horsemen, who he\u2019s never seen properly with his own eyes. Pollution catches his attention first, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s his crown.</p>\n<p>Famine is holding a very specific set of scales, and how did Raquel even lose those, and he leans over to nudge Aziraphale in the side and mutter, \u201cIsn\u2019t that your sword?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he hisses, elbowing him in the side and shooting a terrified look at Michael. Crowley\u2019s surprised to see her here, actually. He\u2019d have though she\u2019d send Uriel, who\u2019s been dealing with all the fiddley bits of the apocalypse until now.</p>\n<p>His eyes keep being pulled to Death and then sliding away, like he can\u2019t focus properly, and something about that feels familiar to him, but he can\u2019t place as to why.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Beelzebub says reasonably, \u201cjust order the start to apocalypse, and we\u2019ll take care of the rest, and you can have whatever\u2019s left. That\u2019ll be nice, right? We won\u2019t linger, we\u2019re not interested in earth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Except as a battlefield. Someplace where angels and demons are equally disadvantaged.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adam says, spine straight, \u201cI don\u2019t want to rule over earth, and I like earth the way it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father won\u2019t be happy about that,\u201d Beelzebub says, and Crowley winces. He\u2019d rather not be dragged into this, all things considered.</p>\n<p>Adam\u2019s face settles into a scowl. \u201cDo you mean Satan? He\u2019s not my father!\u201d Oh, that hurts rather more than he\u2019d expected it to. \u201cMy father is the man who raised me, who\u2019s been there my whole life, not some stranger who I\u2019ve never met! If that man was really my father, then he\u2019d be here now!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment where no one does anything at all. The horsemen exchange glances, and Michael and Beelzebub blink, turning to each other, then back to Adam, then their gazes drift over to land on him. It\u2019s all eerily in sync. He starts to shake his head, but it\u2019s too late. \u201cBut he is here,\u201d Beelzebub says.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale starts looking around, and Crowley closes his eyes. Well, the truth has to come out sometime. Adam turns, following her gaze, and looks right at him. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 no, that\u2019s Mr. Crowley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Crowley?\u201d Aziraphale repeats, \u201cWhen on earth did you meet him? How does he know you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and then opens them again. Aziraphale shouts and takes a couple steps back.</p>\n<p>Over his head is a crown of hellfire, the same fire that\u2019s in his eyes as he banishes his sunglasses. He looks at Adam straight on. \u201cHello, darling.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, no one moves, no one so much as breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou! No, there must be some mistake, you\u2019re just a demon,\u201d Aziraphale begins, then stops, and says, \u201cYou\u2019re the king of Hell? For how long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot \u2013 not too long,\u201d he says, not looking away from his son, watching his face as he processes several things all at once. \u201cJust since Lucifer fell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd died,\u201d Michael says bitterly, even after all these years the wound still as fresh as it was when they spoke on the garden wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just a demon when we spoke the first time, and for everything after, well, Beelzebub takes care of most of the day to day running of the place.\u201d</p>\n<p>She puffs up in pride at that, and he smiles without meaning to.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re my dad?\u201d Adam stays, stepping forward, closing the distance between them. \u201cFor real?\u201d</p>\n<p>He wants to reach out to him, wants to gather him to his chest like he\u2019s still baby, but doesn\u2019t. \u201cI am. But you\u2019re right. Mr. Young is your father too, and Mrs. Young is your mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother,\u201d he repeats, and then his voice goes gravely, and the universe pauses, waiting to do his bidding. \u201cWho is my birth mother? Tell me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley opens his mouth, but it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s a pop with a displacement of air, and then Raquel is there, hair pinned on top of her head, the dark holes where her eyes should be looking around in confusion. Most humans see what they want to see, so it looks like her eyes are simply clouded over, like they used to be, but the only people here who see that are probably the Them, and even then maybe not.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s in her judge\u2019s robes, and stumbles, taking a second to right herself. She notices him first, seeing without seeing, and says, \u201cCrowley, what on earth is going on? I was in the middle of something, you can\u2019t just jerk me around whenever you feel like it!\u201d Then, a moment later, \u201cIs that my scale?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur son wants to see you,\u201d he says simply.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur-\u201d she pauses, and it only takes her a second to turn herself towards Adam. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adam rakes his eyes over her, but Crowley can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking, if he\u2019s impressed or horrified, so he blurts, \u201cYou have her eyes.\u201d Then, to Raquel, \u201cHe has your eyes.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she repeats again, apparently at a loss to say anything else. Then, \u201cI carried you for nine years, you know. You always kicked in the night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did?\u201d Adam asks, voice cracking in the middle. He\u2019s looking between them, something terrible in his face, and Crowley aches, in a very human way, and wishes he could whisk them all away from this. \u201cDo you \u2013 do you want me to cause the end of the world?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like,\u201d Raquel says. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine I get to go home no matter who wins. It\u2019s your world. It belongs to you. Do with it whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adam swallows, then focuses entirely on him. \u201cWhy \u2013 why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley opens his mouth, and then has to close it again to clear his throat. \u201cI \u2013 it\u2019s against the rules, you see. I shouldn\u2019t have seen you at all, I was supposed to just \u2013 sire you and let things fall where they may, but I couldn\u2019t, I,\u201d his voice gets caught in his throat, but he finishes, \u201cI loved you too much. I\u2019m sorry, it wasn\u2019t fair to you, none of this has been fair to you, and all a parent wants for their child is a fair world.\u201d He finishes, barely more than a whisper, \u201cI was just following orders. I\u2019ve always followed orders, I\u2019m just not very good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to end the world?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>The answer, for him, is easy. \u201cNo. I love the world. I\u2019m not supposed to do that either. As a demon, as king of hell, as Satan, but I can\u2019t help it. But that\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s not a choice I get to make. It\u2019s all part of the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adam looks at him, then skips his eyes over everyone else, the Them, Michael, Beelzebub, the horsemen, and then he holds out his hand to Crowley.</p>\n<p>Resting on his palm is an apple.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Crowley says.</p>\n<p>Adam is frowning, looking so much older than his age, so much older than he has before. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice. You\u2019re my father, you really are, even if you were lying to me, you were still there, you still love me. And I love you. So it\u2019s a choice. Like in the story you told me, about the snake. Take the apple, and we keep the world. Don\u2019t, and I\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll make us our own garden, for you and me and all the people we care about it, and we\u2019ll be untouched by the war, while heaven and hell tear themselves apart, and the rest of the world along with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Was the decision this easy for Eve? It must have been, he doesn\u2019t remember her hesitating. He doesn\u2019t hesitate either, plucking the apple out his son\u2019s palm and taking a large bite out of it, defiance coursing through his veins.</p>\n<p>Screw the plan. Screw following orders. Screw doing what She wants. What he wants is Adam, and sushi, and concerts, and Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>He swallows and says, \u201cYou knew I\u2019d choose that.\u201d Did She know that Eve would eat the apple?</p>\n<p>Adam smiles, says, \u201cYes,\u201d then turns to the four horsemen and says. \u201cThose don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d He glances at Pepper, who\u2019s always been the quickest among them, both mentally and physically, and she darts forward, kicks War in the shin, and then uses the distraction to grab the flaming sword from her grip. Wensley and Brian spring into action as well, and it all probably has more to do with Adam\u2019s will than the fighting prowess of a couple of eleven year olds, but three of the horsemen fall, and Wensley is left holding the crown, Brian the scale, and Pepper the sword.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what of me?\u201d Death asks, and Crowley finally places the way he can\u2019t quite manage to look at Death for more than a couple of seconds and pales, reaching out for Aziraphale before he remembers that his angel probably hates him now, what with all the lying. But if he does, he doesn\u2019t show it, letting Crowley grip onto his arm and covering his hand with his own, looking concerned in a way he hasn\u2019t through all of this, more worried about Crowley\u2019s fear than the end of the world. \u201cYou cannot kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adam agrees, something knowing in his tone, and has he known this whole time, what Crowley has just figured out. \u201cBut I won\u2019t let you kill everyone either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Death. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Life too,\u201d he says. \u201cIs this not all going accorded to plan, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stiffens at his side and Raquel falls to her knees. \u201cNo, it can\u2019t \u2013 it can\u2019t be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Death pauses, then shifts enough to reveal a smiling mouth, one that isn\u2019t bone, but isn\u2019t flesh either, made of something else that Crowley can\u2019t describe, there\u2019s no words for it, because these are words of men, and nothing like it exists on this earth.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d She answers, and what kind of vessel is She wearing, what kind of construction can withstand the force of Her, the Almighty. Before Adam can press further, before any of them can do anything at all, She\u2019s gone, as if she was never there in the first place.</p>\n<p>Raquel\u2019s hand is outstretched, and Crowley is sure she\u2019d be crying right now if she had eyes. Brian walks forward and places the scale in her palm. \u201cThis is yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says automatically. Her shoulders start to shake, and then she\u2019s gone, taking her scale and her grief with her.</p>\n<p>Wesley steps towards him, holding out his crown, and Crowley takes it with numb fingers. Pepper offers Aziraphale his sword back, and he reaches for it, then pauses, pulling his arm back to his side. \u201cNo, no, you keep it. I think maybe it\u2019ll do you more good than it\u2019ll do me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, well, that\u2019s an idea. \u201cBeelzebub!\u201d he calls out, and she\u2019s by his side in an instant, bending on her knee before him. Good, that makes this easier.</p>\n<p>He takes his crown and drops it onto her head. She freezes, looking up at him with wide, confused eyes. \u201cWhat are you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll still be around if anyone get discorporated or if the hellfire starts to feel cold,\u201d he says, \u201cor, you know, generally what I\u2019ve been around for these past few thousand years. But I think it\u2019s best if you just run things for me, instead, yeah? Just like you have been, except now you have the crown if anyone gives you trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beelzebub does something she hasn\u2019t done in the six thousand years they\u2019ve known each other.</p>\n<p>She hugs him.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s gone in the next moment, hopefully back to hell to tell all the demons to stand down. He looks up, and Michael is missing too. If She doesn\u2019t seem interested in forcing a war between them, he\u2019s hoping Michael won\u2019t be interested in pushing for one either. The witch and the young witchfinder come running out of the building. \u201cWe did it!\u201d she screams, \u201cIt\u2019s all shut down, everything is fine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Adam says, satisfied, \u201cEverything is.\u201d</p>\n<p>He reaches out, takes the apple from Crowley\u2019s hand, then takes a bite himself.</p>\n<p>The darkness overcoming his vision isn\u2019t a surprise, but perhaps it should be.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard for him to wake up. His eyelids feel too heavy and his head feels like cotton, but then it all clears, and he\u2019s gasping himself awake, pushing himself upright. He\u2019s in his bed, in London, not even in Tadfield. He looks out the window, and the world is still there, the sun shining brightly across all of it.</p>\n<p>He turns, taking a step out of his apartment, and shifting to stand outside of Aziraphale\u2019s bookshop. It had been nothing but ash when he saw it last, but it\u2019s back to being whole once more, and through the dusty window, he sees him, his angel.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t occur to him that maybe Aziraphale doesn\u2019t want to see him until he\u2019s already inside, until he\u2019s in the middle of his bookshop, mouth open, but nothing coming out, and not just because he\u2019s uncertain of his welcome.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale isn\u2019t alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it was time we met,\u201d Raquel says, a smile curled around her mouth. She\u2019s wearing jeans and a tshirt, which should be jarring, but he can\u2019t focus on that right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyes,\u201d he says, because they\u2019re back. Still sightless, as far as humans define sight, but there, the same beautiful brown shade he remembers.</p>\n<p>She steps back, away from the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d There\u2019s gust of wind, the effect of her wings unfurling from her back, the ones she cut off so long ago. They\u2019re huge and snowy white, and tears prick at his eyes just to see them again. \u201cGifts, from our son.\u201d She folds them back inside herself, and looks between him and Aziraphale and says, \u201cI\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019ll talk later,\u201d before vanishing.</p>\n<p>For a long moment, there\u2019s only silence, only he and Aziraphale alone in the bookshop.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all back,\u201d Aziraphale says, not looking at him, \u201cjust as it was. Well, more or less. He\u2019s quite good at this reality bending thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, and Aziraphale startles, turning to face him. He wants to step closer, to take his angel\u2019s hand in his own, but he doesn\u2019t want to press his luck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, I know \u2013 I lied to you, for a long time, about who I am, about Adam, about Raquel, and \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t enjoy it, if that matters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stares at him for a long time, and Crowley wants to sink into the floor, wants to slink away and lick his wounds, except he can\u2019t, because Aziraphale is more important than his own fear, than his own pain. Aziraphale is the one to close the distance between them, and then hold out both his hands, waiting. It takes Crowley a confusing moment to figure out what he wants, and then he\u2019s placing his hands in Aziraphale\u2019s gripping them tight as his angel pulls them so close together that they\u2019re nearly chest to chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI always knew you were holding something back,\u201d he says, \u201cand this was it, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, breathless, \u201cnothing else. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale lifts Crowley\u2019s hand to his mouth, kissing the back of it, and Crowley feels like his heart is beating a thousand times a minute. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>They poke around a few more places, double checking things, and Crowley quietly marvels at the feeling of holding Aziraphale\u2019s hand, but then his angel turns to him and asks, \u201cShould we check on your son, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he says, and then they\u2019re in Tadfield once more, in his little house next to the Youngs.</p>\n<p>They step outside and lean against the fence. Dog is barking as the kids play some sort of game involving a soccer ball but which definitely isn\u2019t soccer. It doesn\u2019t take them long to get noticed, Pepper yelling out and waving what probably looks like a pointy stick to other humans, but what is clearly Aziraphale\u2019s sword to them. \u201cYou sure that was a good idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, pleasant smile still perfectly in place.</p>\n<p>Adam drops the balls and comes running towards them, gripping the top part of the fence and pulling himself up so he can balance on the board running along the bottom, putting him nearly at face height. He makes a big show of looking around them, and then leans over to say, \u201cHi, Dad!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d Crowley says, reaching forward to run his hand through his son\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdam, what have I told you about climbing on the fence!\u201d Mrs. Young calls out, and Adam winces as he hops back down. Crowley looks up to see her walking across the yard, although her frown melts into smile when sees them. \u201cHello John, I didn\u2019t realize you were back. And who\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can feel Aziraphale stiffen to hold back at laugh at the first name, and he uses the cover of the fence to step on his foot. \u201cJust arrived, and this is Zira Fell. He\u2019s my, uh,\u201d he hesitates, debating for a second before deciding to go with friend.</p>\n<p>But before he can, Adam pipes up, \u201cMr. Fell is Mr. Crowley\u2019s husband!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a weight on his hand, and he lifts it, confused, seeing Aziraphale doing the same thing out of the corner of his eye. There\u2019s a gold band on his finger where there wasn\u2019t one before, and a matching one on his angel\u2019s finger. He gives a narrowed eyed stare at his son, who tries to look innocent, but isn\u2019t very good at it. He\u2019s sure with some time spent around Aziraphale, that will change. His angel is so good at acting innocent, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were married!\u201d Mrs. Young exclaims, \u201cOh, how lovely!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale agrees, taking his hand once more, \u201cit is.\u201d</p>\n<p>It seems like it\u2019s not going to be the end of world after all. Instead, it feels like the beginning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
