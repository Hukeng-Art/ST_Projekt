  "summary": "<p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think you were a good dude until about two days ago.\u201d Eddie\u2019s still watching Steve, studying the flutter of his eyelashes, the casual way his head turns. Noting the intensity in Steve\u2019s eyes as they lock with Eddie\u2019s.<br>\u201cAnd now?\u201d<br>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re lying in my bed listening to me spill my deepest, darkest secrets,\u201d Eddie finishes.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Steve's wounds are infected. Eddie's the only one who knows how to heal him. Add into the equation a bottle of strong vodka, subtract Steve's shirt, and Eddie's lips get a bit too loose for his own liking. (Or, Eddie gets a tragic backstory and flirts with Steve. Steve flirts back.)</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Happy Pride Month besties! Title's a reference to Phoebe Bridgers, and kinda-sorta the Sex Pistols. During this, keep your eyes peeled for a lil It by Stephen King reference, and those handcuffs on Eddie's wall.</p>\n<p>Finally a small warning before we begin: there are mentions of the AIDS crisis - these are rather abstract, and have little to no relationship with queerness in the story. Still, though, I understand that this topic is heavy and I want you to know that it's touched on.</p>\n<p>ask and ye shall receive.</p>\n<p>also notice the fic name change! i wanted to keep using lyrics from the song so i decided to change the name to the song itself. \"chelsea\" in my mind is a steddie song not because they'd relate to it (thank god) but because steve would be a phoebe bridgers fan and eddie would tolerate it because it's about sid and nancy.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>okay i hope y'all liked it! let me know if you guys want another part with our boys being stupid in their feels and maybe possibly a ronance chapter or somethin? idk. tell me all the thoughts on this one because i live on validation. love you guys!</p>\n<p>SO a few notes: this is a bit of a filler because i did not intend for this to be more than a one shot and WOW was i scrambling for material but we're bridging the gap to some incredibly angsty and gooey romance shit so just... indulge me one more time with this little eddie and robin being pals segue.</p>\n<p>little historical note - ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was a huge player in turning the tide of the AIDS crisis. they advocated for increased research and access to approved medicine, as well as changes to legislation and public policies to support people with aids. (they also still exist!) at the time this fic technically takes place, ACT UP had yet to be founded. that being said, i've heard a lot of people finding that there's very little discussion about and education on ACT UP in younger queer circles, so i wanted to include the detail of eddie's handmade patch for a little callback. please ignore my blatant disrespect for timelines.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>so do you want nancy and robin's side of things first or steve and eddie's? let me know!!!</p>\n<p>so... ronance came first. But never fear I literally wrote the steddie chapter at the same time so that will be posted within... twenty minutes. And I expect hype on both of them, thank you. (she said sarcastically)</p>\n<p>if these chapters need editing my apologies, i'm driving out to d.c. for the march for our lives tomorrow and wanted to get these up!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>there. after having to explain how gay these two are in a wafflehouse the other day, i finally got it down on paper. tell me what you want to see next because this is four chapter past its due date but its still a preemptive fix-it fic and unlike the duffers i'm here for fan service.</p>\n<p>N E WAY i gotta be up in three hours so leave me some comments to read when i get up :)</p>\n<p>yo the f slur is in here but in a \"eddie uses it about himself and no one else and not in a negative way\" bc we reclaim that shit thanks.</p>\n<p>everything else tho is roughly PG-13 relationship fluff because I can and I will and ur honor I love my boys.</p>\n<p>ALSO ALSO ALSO</p>\n<p>fluffy note at the end i just needed to put that bit in first :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>istg i'm convinced some of you are bots because you're all too damn sweet. literally, everyone who's said stuff about how this is your favorite steddie fic and stuff - ur cruel liars but also keep it up bc at least it's motivating me to write more!</p>\n<p>and if u aren't boldly lying and have hollywood connections... dear duffer brothers let me work on your show with you pls i would absolutely die if you did and i have a resume ready to go for you.</p>\n<p>all far-fetched dreams aside i really appreciate all of your comments and i get so excited when i see them. thank you all so much.</p>\n<p>we're slowly navigating back to some plot. y'all comments r too sweet, n i love you all very dearly. i also apologize because i've seen a bunch of cute steddie trope lists on tumblr but not a single goddamn one of them has been in this entire fic and that's just disappointing!!!</p>\n<p>also if you haven't noticed, i'm going in a poorly focused POV cycle of Eddie, Steve, Robin, Nancy. i may edit later to change some of the ronance chapter names because chelsea is a very steddie song and i feel like ICU fits ronance a lot better. and i'm on tumblr and insta and can drop those handles if you are perhaps interested. i feel like there was something else i was supposed to say but i don't remember ahhhh so enjoy this shit</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>oh that's what i was supposed to say: karen's out of character. oh well.</p>\n<p>alright i am debating if i end this before the big final supernatural fight or not. would y'all rather see something just based on eddie's relationship with the law rn or something that involves Vecna? let me know!</p>\n<p>also in this chapter i totally talk about season two like i remember season two well enough to talk about it. whoops.</p>\n<p>penultimate chapter i think! but don't worry i'm gonna tie everything up nicely here n then i'm working on a new college AU for the fruity four that will include similar amounts of fluff and angst bc i can't help myself. stick around here a little longer and i'll probably post a preview for some of the upcoming content :)</p>\n<p>n e way here's some massive wish fulfillment that a couple of you called! and a bit of historical inaccuracies (AZT trials would've most likely started quite a bit after Eddie's mom died, but still we're going with it.) Enjoy!</p>\n<p>this is it babes. the last little update. the last ride. thank you for all coming on this weird and not at all planned journey with me, and i hope you have a bit more angst in you.</p>\n<p>stick around for the end for a tiny sneak peak of my newest fic, a modern college AU with too much angst to function. i'm obsessed with it and i hope you will be too.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>okay, here it is: a tiny sneak piece of my next work \"listen to iron maiden, baby\"</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s mixtape \u201ccome by the ud whore\u201d from rebel robin<br>Love You So Bad, Ezra Furman<br>Welcome to Paradise, Green Day<br>Chapstick, Coin<br>Cocaine Jesus, rainbow kitten surprise<br>I\u2019m In Your Mind, King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard</p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I got seven years left on this planet, so\u2026\u201d Eddie takes a drag, \u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>Steve is acutely aware of the tattoos that cover his arm and the battle vest he totes unapologetically. It declares things like \u201cfuck the patriarchy\u201d and \u201cpride's still a riot\u201d and \u201cit's Revenge of the Jedi,\u201d all while proudly keeping the boy\u2019s lean biceps free from everything but his shitty band t-shirt.<br>Steve shoves a cigarette between his lips and shrugs. \u201cWhy seven years?\u201d<br>\u201cTwenty-Seven Club, baby.\u201d</p>",
  "text": "<p>\n<span>They\u2019re preparing the weapons in Eddie\u2019s trailer when he notices it. Steve\u2019s borrowing one of his t-shirts from the Hellfire Club from Eddie\u2019s junior year. It\u2019s already a bit small on Eddie, and it pulls tight now across Steve\u2019s chest and stomach. And as they prepare for the impending battle, Eddie can\u2019t even focus on the fact that </span>\n<em>\n<span>there\u2019s an impending battle</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Mostly because Steve should not look good in a remnant of the worst year of Eddie\u2019s life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But also kind of because the way Steve sticks his tongue through his teeth just a bit every time the fabric hits his stomach a certain way. His wounds should be healing by now: it\u2019s been two days since the upside down. Something about the way he reacts, though, to the shift of soft, well-worn fabric worries Eddie to no end.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So when Nancy suggests someone stay with Eddie while they go get dinner, he requests Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s hurt,\u201d Eddie says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Jesus, Harrington.</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u201cAnd, I, uh, actually wanted some advice anyway.\u201d He glances at Robin, because </span>\n<em>\n<span>isn\u2019t that what straight boys do</span>\n</em>\n<span>. She\u2019s watching Nancy, thank god.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s not: he\u2019s staring straight at Eddie, like he\u2019s trying to decode him. God, Eddie hopes he doesn\u2019t get too far in that process.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally, Nancy lets up. And Eddie\u2019s a bit relieved, because if she dedicated any more brain power to her ex, her brain might explode. Not that Vecna isn\u2019t trying to do that already, but </span>\n<em>\n<span>come on, Nance,</span>\n</em>\n<span> he wants to scream. It was Robin who figured out your favorite song; not your ex. Eddie wonders if Vecna tormented Nancy about being queer while she was gone, or if she hasn\u2019t addressed it yet. She should get on that, with how Robin watches her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they\u2019re gone, Steve finally breaks the silence. \u201cLook man, if you\u2019re gonna ask about Robin, quit while you\u2019re ahead. You\u2019re really not her\u2026 um\u2026 type.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh, so Steve knows. Maybe that makes things a little bit easier, then.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Or maybe Eddie just wants Steve to call him a fucking freak like everyone else. Maybe the inevitable rejection would hurt less.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019s not mine,\u201d Eddie says, and he hopes to </span>\n<em>\n<span>God</span>\n</em>\n<span> Steve figures it out. From the useless look on his face, it isn\u2019t clicking. So he moves on. \u201cI just said that so you\u2019d stay. Because, look, you\u2019re clearly in a lot of pain right now. And I know you wanna play brave for everyone else, but trust me, I am the last person who wants that right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve frowns. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou aren\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d Steve stops, and exhales. He looks at his feet. \u201cYeah. No. I think it might be infected.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s lived in a trailer park most of his life, and if he learned one thing, it\u2019s how to pull together back-alley cures for every ailment. Back when he lived two doors down with his parents, he used to help her mom take care of the kids on the block when they got hurt, or sick. Back then, he thought he\u2019d be a doctor one day.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now, he reflects briefly on his life while he digs through his uncle's liquor cabinet for a specific cheap vodka in a specific plastic bottle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTake your shirt off, and get on my bed,\u201d Eddie calls. He wishes to god that came in another context.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And that\u2019s the reason why, when he\u2019s on his feet, and back in the room, his jaw almost drops. Because Steve isn\u2019t sitting on his bed \u2014 he\u2019s laying shirtless, on his back, with his head propped up on his arm. His muscles are tense, and he\u2019s a bit sweaty.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He has a fever, Eddie realizes. And his attention snaps away from sex-god Steve Harrington and focuses in on the wounds at his side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re a nasty shade of yellow and red, surrounded by every shade of green and blue and purple. They\u2019re infected for sure, and Eddie isn\u2019t even sure where to start.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is gonna hurt.\u201d That sounds like as good a place as any.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He moves to Steve\u2019s side, the one by the edge of his bed, so he doesn\u2019t have to climb onto the bed with him just yet. He gets down on his knees, and as he uncaps the bottle, Steve asks, \u201cAre you sure you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie glances up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve done this before, promise.\u201d Yet another line Eddie would do anything to say on his knees to Steve in another very specific context.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou sure?\u201d And Eddie can hear it now, hear how terrified Steve is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, he does what his mom always did, when kids were scared: he tells a story. \u201cMy mom was a nurse. When I was growing up, well, a lot of families around here can't afford hospitals, or prescription medicine. On her days off, she did what she could with what we had to help out around here. So growing up, I did this a lot. Do you know how many kids don\u2019t realize you have to wash the scraps on your knees?\u201d Eddie suddenly pours the alcohol onto Steve\u2019s wound. Steve screams, and tenses. He claws at Eddie with one hand, writhing from the intense burn. And Eddie rolls just out of the way, expertly capping the bottle before anything spills. Because Eddie has done this. A lot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a moment, Steve leans back on the bed and moans, \u201cHoly fuck.\u201d He looks like a wreck on Eddie\u2019s bed, and Eddie literally has to look away \u2013 it\u2019s a lot to handle without just </span>\n<em>\n<span>imploding</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d Eddie asks, trying to mask the fact that he cannot breathe. Steve throws something at Eddie\u2014Eddie\u2019s only stuffed animal, a teddy bear\u2014in response.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNever again, Munson.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie finally manages his composure, and glances up. \u201cWe still have one more round of this, Harrington.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Jesus. I\u2019m gonna need some of that, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t want this shit. It\u2019s, like, half Everclear, half the cheapest shit they sell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah? Trust me, after that, I do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie hesitates, then says, \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve pats the bed next to him weakly. \u201cLet\u2019s get drunk, Eds.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eds? They\u2019d circle back to that later. Eddie slowly circles around the bed, crawling up next to Steve but, like, in a </span>\n<em>\n<span>chill bro way</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He hands the bottle off to Steve, who doesn\u2019t even hesitate before tossing back quite a bit of the liquor. Eddie\u2019s almost in awe. He lets Steve hold the bottle a moment longer, before taking it himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And in a flash, he dumps just enough on Steve\u2019s other wound. Steve tries to punch Eddie this time, but Eddie just pushes him down into the bed. His hand fans out across Steve\u2019s bare, shaggy chest for only a moment too long. Eddie decides it\u2019s the pain that\u2019s making Steve\u2019s heart beat so fast.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the fuck Munson?\u201d Steve won\u2019t look Eddie in the eyes, just averting his glare lower.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Eddie mumbles. He rolls back onto the bed, and tosses back some of the vodka himself. Unlike Steve, he coughs, loudly, and lurches forward. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s fucking disgusting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou get used to it,\u201d Steve says, still wincing. Eddie offers him more, and he gladly accepts it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A little while later, Eddie feels properly smashed. Maybe it\u2019s the liquor on an empty stomach, or the boy lying next to him in the full size bed, but his body feels fake. Like it might betray him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat happened to your mom?\u201d Steve asks quietly, his voice heavy with liquor and exhaustion and a little bit of sweetness Eddie hasn\u2019t heard before.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, what happened to her?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d Perhaps it wasn\u2019t his body that would betray him, but his words. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d He tries to think up the words. It was supposed to be a routine blood transfusion. It was supposed to just be anemia.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was supposed to be her </span>\n<em>\n<span>son</span>\n</em>\n<span> who got it first, because he was the freak.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe died,\u201d Eddie says. Because everyone knows she died. Because clearly that\u2019s not the answer Steve wants.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And now Eddie folds. \u201cShe had </span>\n<em>\n<span>it</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>It</span>\n</em>\n<span>, the reason he never goes home with random guys from the crowds at shows. </span>\n<em>\n<span>It</span>\n</em>\n<span>, the word whispered in the hallways around Hawkins, attached to insult after homophobic insult. </span>\n<em>\n<span>It</span>\n</em>\n<span>, the disease that never should\u2019ve been Eddie\u2019s alone to deal with, before the media and the politicians and the small-minded people in his hometown got ahold of it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie waits for Steve to respond.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d He just says. And then he adds, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. Is that why you\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI what?\u201d Eddie says it too quickly. Maybe he was wrong about Steve. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know about Robin after all. Maybe he\u2019s an ass like the rest of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou stopped being Hawkins\u2019 freaky genius kid?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And now it\u2019s Eddie\u2019s turn to say, \u201cOh.\u201d Because how would he have known Steve remembered that, once upon a time, Eddie was going places. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Eddie</span>\n</em>\n<span> barely does anymore.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was you, right? I remember being jealous of you, when they moved you straight from our seventh grade class to high school. I couldn\u2019t wait to run with all the older kids, and you just\u2026 Did.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s hard to graduate when your mom\u2019s dying of\u2026 dying. Or when your dad disowns you. Or when you\u2019re accused of murder.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour dad disowned you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie reaches out, and takes the bottle back from Steve. He takes a swig; Steve was right, he is getting used to it. And now, it\u2019s now or never. Eddie doesn\u2019t know if he should say what he\u2019s about to, but he does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, well\u2026 My dad found out I was gay. I found out he was religious.\u201d Steve doesn\u2019t say anything, and Eddie doesn\u2019t have it in him to look at him. He takes another draw of vodka, and continues on. \u201cMy uncle didn\u2019t give a shit. His sister died because people were too busy hating on gay guys to focus on what mattered, so he took me in. Everyone at school already called me a freak, so nothing my dad said changed that. But there\u2019s something about being told to pack your bags because you had a crush on Andy Felps\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAndy Felps?\u201c Steve says slowly. Eddie gulps.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, Andy Felps.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve bubbles for a moment, stuttering over a set of syllables that Eddie can barely make out. Finally, he manages, \u201cBut he\u2019s so\u2026 I\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>so much cooler</span>\n</em>\n<span> than him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie doesn\u2019t even know how to respond at first, so he says the only drunk thing that pops into his mind. \u201cAre you jealous, Harrington?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d Eddie immediately looks at Steve, and his intense proximity gives him the perfect vantage point from which to watch Steve\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cI mean, no! I mean\u2026 I guess I just think you should\u2019ve had a crush on me and not\u2026 Andy Felps.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And for once, Eddie isn\u2019t convinced that Steve\u2019s straight. In fact, the panic on his face is so much closer to the kind Eddie experienced back when he </span>\n<em>\n<span>did like</span>\n</em>\n<span> Andy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think you were a good dude until about two days ago.\u201d Eddie\u2019s still watching him, studying the flutter of his eyelashes, the casual way his head turns. Noting the intensity in Steve\u2019s eyes as they lock with Eddie\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re lying in my bed listening to me spill my deepest, darkest secrets,\u201d Eddie finishes. Steve grins drunkenly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He blinks, once, and then looks back to the ceiling. Eddie doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining that Steve shifts a bit closer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe should, um, bandage you up.\u201d Eddie gulps, overwhelmed by the sensation of Steve\u2019s body heat. \u201cBut the right way, this time. Not with your ex\u2019s t-shirt, or whatever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, yeah. We\u2026 yeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm. Just stay here, and I\u2019ll grab the stuff from out front.\u201d Pouring honey on Steve Harrington\u2019s body would absolutely be too much to handle normally. Just to make it extra fun, Eddie grabs his handcuffs from the wall on the way back in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you don\u2019t hit me this time,\u201d Eddie says, as he tosses them to Steve. Steve looks sufficiently nervous now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing this time?\u201d He asks, but Eddie watches as he dutifully puts on the handcuffs. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Good boy</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Eddie thinks. And then he blushes and looks away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHoney does a really good job of dressing wounds,\u201d Eddie whispers, as he places one knee down on the thin layer of mattress between Steve and his side. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go ahead and kind of cover your cuts in the them, before I get you all wrapped up, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve watches Eddie\u2019s every move as he fills the deep, messy cuts with honey, pooling on as much as he can of the thick golden syrup. Then, he shifts his knee between Steve\u2019s legs. Steve gulps, but still he watches Eddie\u2019s face. Maybe he\u2019s waiting for Eddie to betray himself here. Eddie slowly slides the bandages under Steve\u2019s back, catching some of the drizzled honey before it hits the mess of sheets beneath them. Eddie begins wrapping them around Steve\u2019s toned, smooth torso, trying hard to not hyperfixate on the way Steve flexes when Eddie\u2019s calloused fingers brush against his skin. And then he\u2019s done, and still perched with half his body between Steve\u2019s legs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The front door opens, and, shockingly, Steve stays put until Nancy calls to them from the kitchen, proclaiming burgers and fries. Eddie shoves whatever shirt he can grab off the floor (a Sex Pistols shirt that Eddie cut the sleeves off of) in Steve\u2019s direction, and heads into the kitchen. On the way down the hall, he swaps their medicinal vodka for a different, much tastier bottle of cheap vodka.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you get the slushies?\u201d Eddie asks. Nancy points to the counter next to her, as she and Robin dole out burgers (and a grilled cheese for Max).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d Robin asks. She gives Eddie a quick head-nod in Nancy\u2019s direction as he goes to put a little vodka in each slushy. A warning, Eddie thinks. He quickly dumps what he can in, and caps the bottle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBedroom. We bandaged him up again.\u201d Then, Eddie hip-bumps Nancy. \u201cYour shirt wasn\u2019t totally doing it, Princess.\u201d She laughs, thank </span>\n<em>\n<span>God</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, well, it got us through the Upside Down, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Eddie can respond with something snippy, Steve stumbles into the kitchen. His hair\u2019s a wreck, and Eddie desperately just wants to pull on it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d Robin asks. Steve doesn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he takes one of the slushies and heads out the door. The slam of aluminum on aluminum shakes the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everything silent, except for the quiet sound of \u201cRunning up that Hill\u201d on Max\u2019s walkman. Robin locks eyes with Eddie, and a silent understanding passes between them. She frowns.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy moves to follow him, but Robin stops her. \u201cI got this,\u201d She promises, and Eddie trusts that she does. She soundlessly slips out the door after Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve Harrington is sitting on the steps alone when it finally hits him, why he's sitting out on the steps alone. There\u2019s more vodka in his slushie, the slushie</span>\n<em>\n<span> Eddie made for him</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and he gulps it down. Because Steve is scared. And he\u2019s scared of the fact that he\u2019s scared. And he\u2019s scared that fear and guilt is exactly what </span>\n<em>\n<span>the brain-melting monster</span>\n</em>\n<span> that is coming for all of them feeds off of.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe his dad was right: he really should\u2019ve gotten his ass out of Hawkins for college. But there\u2019s part of Steve that wonders if he can ever truly leave Hawkins behind; if the red dust in the dirt will always be stuck to his sweat when the temperature rises above 80 wherever he goes; if the mysteries and the nail-studded baseball bats and the boys in the trailer park will haunt him his whole life long.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The door to the trailer swings open, nearly hitting Steve. Another part of Hawkins he could never leave tramps out onto the steps with him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, drama queen,\u201d Robin says, dropping down next to him. \u201cYou gonna talk about the show you put on in there, or should I just keep making jokes about how ridiculous your outfit is?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve just presses his forehead into her shoulder. He doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s crying until the tears press into his skin, and soak through the thin fabric of her thrift store jacket. Robin instinctively wraps her arm around him, pulling him into her. She presses her lips to his hair, and even now, Steve wishes it could\u2019ve been her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>How easy would\u2019ve been to make a life with his best friend? His better half? The only person he knows who manages to keep him enthralled in talks about movies and music and marching band drama? But they\u2019d never quite clicked romantically even before he knew about her, and Robin coming out entirely cemented it. She was his soulmate, but not in that bullshit Nora Ephron way. And all this time, he was convinced it was because of her, because she just wasn\u2019t made that way.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now, he\u2019s having a lot of fantasies about a pair of shitty toy handcuffs and wondering if maybe it\u2019d been his fault all along.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTalk to me, Stevo,\u201d Robin whispers. He laughs just a bit, mostly just exhaling air onto her shoulder and smiling into it. But it fades quickly. And then the tears come back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRob, I\u2026\u201d He takes a breath, and then he says it. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Steve sends out a prayer to every God he knows, hoping that Robin loves him the way he loves her. Hoping that that\u2019s all it takes to clue her in. Hoping that, after a year, he doesn\u2019t have to say anything else. Because he can\u2019t. Because he doesn\u2019t even know where to begin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her hand squeezes his shoulder. \u201cI had Ms. Castler for homeroom in fifth grade,\u201d She whispers, \u201cAnd she sat me next to Liz Fender one day. Oh, god, I thought I was going to combust. I just\u2026 I wanted so desperately to be friends with her. I wanted to braid her curly brown hair, and talk to her about the Star Wars pin she always wore, and be in her friend group of cool nerdy girls. And so I did it. I forced my way into her friend group day by day, homeroom class by homeroom class.\u201d She takes a sip of Steve\u2019s drink, and coughs. \u201cGross.\u201d He takes it out of her hand, and takes a sip, forehead still glued to her shoulder. She runs a soft hand through his hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyway, she invited me over to her house, one night, for this big sleepover she was having. And I was so nervous. Not because I wasn\u2019t friends with these girls or anything, but because they were the kind of girls who got Baby-Alives and Easy Bake Ovens for Christmas and always had new shoes on the first day of school. Way outside of my tax bracket.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut then we were sitting in the basement, the six of us, and Dana Cole asked everyone if they thought Tommy H was cute.\u201d Steve finally breaks away from Robin, the look on his face one of understanding and a little bit of disgust. \u201cYeah, yeah. I know, Tommy fuckin\u2019 H. But I didn\u2019t even know we were supposed to like boys yet,\u201d She says, her voice suddenly cracking. \u201cAnd everyone went around talking about who they liked and why and\u2026 And I realized I liked Liz. Like actually liked Liz. I didn\u2019t even know that was a possibility until that moment.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve brushes his face with the back of his hand, and then pushes off the steps. He\u2019s pacing, now, his hand folded behind his head. His sides scream, but it helps to numb his brain just a bit, like the vodka. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, Robin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In one swoop, she\u2019s off the patio, and blocking his path. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Steve\u2019s hands drop to his side, and she takes them slowly. \u201cTell me about what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRemember how I thought you would hate me if you knew the truth? I was wrong, then. And you\u2019re wrong now. </span>\n<em>\n<span>You can talk to me</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sighs, and his shoulders sag. He doesn\u2019t recognize his words as he speaks them, but they flow out of him like they\u2019ve been there forever. \u201cWhile you guys were gone, Eddie fixed me up. And we talked. And I just kept thinking about how nice it would be to press into him and disappear for a while.\u201d The fear in his voice breaks for just a moment with the joy that accompanies his thought. \u201cI\u2019m so tired, Rob. And confused. I just\u2026 want to go back to that moment, in his bed, and never have to leave it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve\u2026 You like Eddie, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And now the tears are back, and Steve is shaking his head. His grip tightens on Robin, like he\u2019s so scared she\u2019ll float away. He bites his lip, hard, and looks at the ground. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, I </span>\n<em>\n<span>can\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Suddenly, he lets go of Robin\u2019s hands, and the dam breaks. Every thought Steve has had in the last hour \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s been days, weeks, </span>\n<em>\n<span>whole lifetimes</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u2013 comes pouring out. \u201cI loved Nancy. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I know I loved Nancy</span>\n</em>\n<span>. And I loved you, so much that for about a month the words </span>\n<em>\n<span>just friends</span>\n</em>\n<span> made my chest </span>\n<em>\n<span>hurt</span>\n</em>\n<span>. And I have kissed almost every girl who I went to high school with, and I had sex with maybe half of them\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGross.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c--And I have paused </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fast Times</span>\n</em>\n<span> at </span>\n<em>\n<span>53 minutes and 5 seconds</span>\n</em>\n<span>! So how come I can\u2019t get the thought of Eddie fucking Munson\u2019s hands and his hair and his smile and his fucking </span>\n<em>\n<span>dead mom</span>\n</em>\n<span> out of my brain no matter how fucking hard I try? I can\u2019t be\u2026 I can\u2019t be </span>\n<em>\n<span>this</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d His hands are in his hair, and he rips through it, making a mess of it. Everything feels hot and tight and terrifying.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin rests a hand on his chest. \u201cSteve. It\u2019s scary as hell. I know. I mean, look at me. I\u2019m falling hard for a girl and I don\u2019t think I can ever tell her how I feel because I can\u2019t risk it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVickie likes boobies,\u201d Steve mumbles, despite himself. Robin grimaces.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight. Yeah. Vickie. That\u2019s who I\u2026\u201d She taps her fist on his chest, and looks away. \u201cIt hurts, a lot of the time. And it\u2019s fucking hard. But there\u2019s also a big beautiful world out there where you and Eddie can be happy and normal and stay in that bed all day with no one bothering you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shakes his head. \u201cRobin, I like girls. I have always liked girls. I\u2019m not gay. I don\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t like guys.\u201d His face is white, and strained, and he looks like he\u2019s trying not to cry again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Robin\u2019s just smiling at him, with the smile Robin reserves only for Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve Harrington, is this sexuality crisis because you don\u2019t think you are capable of liking girls and guys?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He shrinks, just a bit. Just like Robin knows Steve does when people uncomplicate the things he makes so complicated for himself. \u201cI mean\u2026 Part of it, yeah.\u201d Because not all of it is, but he doesn\u2019t know how to quantify the part of it that </span>\n<em>\n<span>isn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He doesn\u2019t know how to explain that his heart starts beating all too fast when Eddie smiles both because Eddie has the perfect smile and because Eddie </span>\n<em>\n<span>shouldn\u2019t have</span>\n</em>\n<span> the perfect smile. But Robin knows Steve, and Steve knows Robin knows Steve, and so Steve knows Robin knows what he means by </span>\n<em>\n<span>part of it</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBisexuality exists,\u201d Robin says. It\u2019s the explanation Steve needs, but doesn\u2019t entirely understand. He blinks, and her smile grows a bit wider. Because Steve also knows Robin loves explaining things she\u2019s passionate about. \u201cPlenty of people like guys and girls alike,\u201d Robin continues. \u201cYou can do that, ya know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did not spend a three months listening to David Bowie every time we drove to work for you to not know about bisexuality.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDavid Bowie likes guys?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus!\u201d Robin presses the palm of hand to her face, but she\u2019s laughing. Soon, Steve is too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am nothing like David Bowie,\u201d Steve says, and then Robin\u2019s laughing even harder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, because David Bowie can sing!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, no one ever said </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can sing!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd so can Tammy Thompson!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, okay, that is just offensive. Do you really think I can\u2019t sing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve driven me to work and school since August. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I know you can\u2019t sing.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve opens his mouth to protest, and then closes his mouth. He grins. \u201cI-\u201c Steve begins, standing up to her challenge, \u201cI will be king.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Robin shrieks, and covers her face with her hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you, you will be queen.\u201d Steve gives her a little mock bow, and offers her a hand. Despite herself, and Steve\u2019s god awful singing, she takes it. He spins her around. \u201cThough nothing will drive them away-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe can be heroes,\u201d She joins in, \u201cJust for one day.\u201d And then he pulls her into a hug. It\u2019s the kind that feels like it has to last forever, or else the world might cave in and the sun might explode and you might have a terrifyingly major sexuality crisis about a boy with long messy hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI really like him, Rob,\u201d He whispers into her shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd it\u2019s fucking terrifying.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know. But that\u2019s the thing about feelings: they\u2019re kind of supposed to be terrifying.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He sighs. \u201cI really thought I was going crazy there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She steps back, breaking the earth-shattering, all important hug. \u201cYeah, because you\u2019re a bonehead!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are ruining the moment here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhatever, dingus.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a few more minutes, Robin reminds Steve that Mickey's burgers always get gummy if they sit too long. He wipes his eyes a few more times, even though they still burn from the tears. It\u2019s not that he feels better: there\u2019s still a part of him standing on the basketball court, listening to every manner of slur hurled at him. But now there\u2019s the part of him that remembers being swim team captain</span>\n<em>\n<span>.</span>\n</em>\n<span> And how no one gave a shit when he and his teammates checked each other out in their speed-os. (Steve\u2019s starting to realize that maybe that wasn\u2019t entirely straight behavior of any of them.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe one day life\u2019ll be like swim team,\u201d Steve says to Robin as they head back up the steps. He can feel himself trying to rationalize it now, like the day he went to Nancy with flowers and the day he decided not to go to community college and the day he realized the monsters under the bed were real. But he knows all of that worked out for the best, and something about that is comforting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin just stares at him. Then she says, \u201cI think I\u2019m in love with your ex-girlfriend.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve blinks, and turns towards her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I thought we were just saying whatever boneheaded dumb idea shit came to mind. Sorry about that.\u201d She opens the trailer door, and Steve knows their conversation has to end there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, he says, \u201cRob, we\u2019ll discuss this later.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, Dad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Nancy asks. And all at once, Steve realizes he\u2019s over her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looks past her to Eddie, and instantly sees the pain that floods his features. After all the shit he\u2019s been unpacking, he didn\u2019t even think about how Eddie felt. But it\u2019s clear, now, that this situation hurt him just as much as it hurt Steve. And Steve knows for sure, then, that he likes guys too, because he just wants to run to Eddie and throw his arms around him. He just wants to make sure Eddie knows that he is loved and safe, that he\u2019ll never be a freak.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead he just forces on the biggest smile he can and says, \u201cYeah, just had to talk through some stuff. Did you guys get my double bacon boy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The air in the Upside Down is heavy with pollen and sexual tension and Robin is more than over it. She doesn\u2019t even want to be back here, especially not when she has to watch Nancy try to flirt with Steve. She should\u2019ve expected Nancy Wheeler to still be in love with him: every girl she\u2019s ever liked chose</span>\n<em>\n<span> him</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Even Liz Fender did at the cursed sleepover.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>At least everyone's back in their appropriate boxes</span>\n</em>\n<span>, She thinks, as she and Eddie walk shoulder to shoulder. The freaks are finally together. Only, unlike what most of the basketball players think, the \u201cfreak\u201d label does not have the same one-size-fits-all quality as \u201cpopular.\u201d Case-in-point: Robin and Eddie have next to nothing in common. Except, she hopes, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Steve</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGross,\u201d Robin says, trying to break the awkward silence filled with watching the worst kind of straightness. Eddie gives her a side eye.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of cute. Like\u2026 soulmate shit\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe has a boyfriend,\u201d Robin snaps. Okay, she definitely needs to reign in her feelings. \u201cAnd anyway, Steve\u2019s not into her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe was.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike a year ago!\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Your gay is showing</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Robin thinks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie just smiles, and looks down. \u201cSo, you and Steve\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2013Are just friends,\u201d Robin cuts in. Because that\u2019s always the second question people ask, after they try to establish why Robin and Steve are friends. From where they are standing, Robin figures Eddie kind of figured out what brought them together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie exhales a little laugh, and Robin doesn\u2019t have to look at him to picture his face right now. \u201cNo, I know. Henderson complains about it like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>all the time</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Robin nods, because she\u2019s experienced plenty of Dustin\u2019s \u201cSteve and Robin\u201d rants. She usually tells him that she\u2019s into older men, or hates hairspray, or is into older men who hate hairspray. \u201cI was gonna ask if you guys are like\u2026 Best friends, I guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin hesitates. She wants to tell him she thinks Steve might be her soulmate in a solely platonic-with-a-capital-P sense, but she isn\u2019t sure Steve feels the same way. What she is sure of is that he has feelings for </span>\n<em>\n<span>Eddie</span>\n</em>\n<span>, which means she definitely can\u2019t claim to be Steve\u2019s soulmate to </span>\n<em>\n<span>Eddie</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not vague at all.\u201d Right then, Nancy laughs at something Steve says. Robin visibly cringes. Eddie fully turns to Robin now. \u201cOkay, do you think you might be overreacting now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Overreacting? No. Eddie just doesn\u2019t entirely know what she\u2019s reacting to. Or, maybe, he does. She can\u2019t help but notice the little \u201cACT UP\u201d that he\u2019s stitched into his vest, and even though it\u2019s a new definition to the words, she wonders if it\u2019s really truly the reference she thinks it is. If he\u2019s who she thinks he might be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If \u201cfreak\u201d really is more one-size-fits-all than she thought. \u201cEddie, are you gay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He stops walking. Actually stops moving. Robin reluctantly stops too, and turns around so she can look at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He sizes her up, once, and his fingers lightly brush the little ACT UP embroidery. \u201cRobin, </span>\n<em>\n<span>are you gay</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Robin breath catches in her throat. Because she can tell, from the smallest bit of fear in his eyes. It\u2019s a silent understanding.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCool,\u201d She whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCool.\u201d They start walking again, this time a little closer than before. Then, Eddie hip-bumps Robin. She\u2019s started to realize he\u2019s the kind of person who likes to hip-bump people, if that\u2019s the kind of thing you can notice about people.\u00a0 \u201cDo you like Nancy?\u201d He asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s Robin\u2019s turn to freeze. She half-feels like she\u2019s sitting on that movie theater bathroom floor all over again. Maybe it's the nausea that Steve warned her the pollen might cause. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that how she answers changes everything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, she doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, she says, \u201cDo you like Steve?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unlike before, there\u2019s no fear this time. Instead, Eddie just grins widely. There\u2019s something boyish about it, unlike so many of the smiles she\u2019s seen him offer to the rest of the party in the last week. Robin doesn\u2019t know if that makes her happy or sad.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCool,\u201d He says, after a moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then they\u2019re walking again, and Robin has half the mind to ask where they\u2019re going, but this is the one time she trusts Steve with no argument. He\u2019s been playing at this game a lot longer than she has, and no one seems to be better at it than him. Instead, she says, \u201cYou should go for it, you know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve. You should go for it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo way, Han. That\u2019s like\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLancelot going for Guinevere?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight!\u201d His voice cracks, and Robin realizes that he\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>nervous</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Of course he\u2019s nervous. Of course that\u2019s why he\u2019s convinced Steve\u2019s in love with Nancy, when in reality Steve won\u2019t shut up about </span>\n<em>\n<span>Eddie and his fucking handcuffs</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly practically taken, and I should honor those wishes because it\u2019s clearly not meant to be and, um\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLancelot and Guinevere ended up together, Eds.\u201d He huffs, and Robin can\u2019t help but laugh a little bit. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dustin\u2019s filled me and Steve in on your inability to pass an English class many a-time.\u201d She tries her best to keep the laugh going as she speaks, but part of her suddenly remembers that, once upon a time, Eddie was gonna be the kid who got out. He was the super genius; now, he\u2019s stuck in Hawkins, just like the rest of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know about King Arthur,\u201d Eddie says. And then, like he\u2019s read her mind, he adds, \u201cI used to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>going places</span>\n</em>\n<span>, ya know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe read King Arthur two months ago,\u201d Robin points out, \u201cAnd if I remember correctly you mixed up Avalon and Camelot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie splays his arm out to the side away from Robin. \u201cHey, I have a reputation to maintain here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were faking it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh\u2026 duh.\u201d Eddie laughs and skips, once. \u201cI\u2019ve read every Lord of the Rings book, all of Dune, the entire \u2018Stand\u2019 which is a </span>\n<em>\n<span>fucking brick</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2026 You think I haven\u2019t read King Arthur?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou mixed up </span>\n<em>\n<span>Avalon and Camelot</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIronically. I was sticking it\u2014\u201d he lightly punches her shoulder, \u201c\u2014to the man.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She swats at his arm lightly, and starts thinking back on what got them into this conversation. After a moment, she glances over at Eddie. \u201cWhy\u2019d you call me Han?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHan Solo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, obviously. But why me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe have another Star Wars nerd on our hands?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnswer the question, Dingus.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie puts his hands up in mock surrender. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really.\u201d After a brief pause, which Robin realizes is just for the drama of it all, he says, \u201cI just think you have someone close to you right now who is trying to make you jealous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cNancy is </span>\n<em>\n<span>straight</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve both clearly had that talk while going through her extensive Donna Summers\u2019 collection.\u201d Robin buries her head in her hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation.\u201d Everything\u2019s getting too loud and too stressful and Robin really wants to go home.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that started this whole thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s enough to send everything tumbling out of control. \u201cYeah, because you actually have a chance!\u201d She stomps her foot once in frustration.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d And Robin\u2019s so full of shame. Because Steve\u2019s never said anything about her, even when Dustin\u2019s ragged on him and Lucas\u2019s made jokes and Max\u2019s asked him point blank if Robin likes girls. And here she was, blowing his secret within hours of learning it. So, she covers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just mean, like, he\u2019s never confirmed if he\u2019s straight or not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie gives her a once-over. \u201cUh huh. And Nancy has?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, uh\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d Fuck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou still have a shot,\u201d Eddie says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a gay best friend,\u201d Robin says at the same time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He smiles. \u201cNo, she just has a weird soft spot for you that I cannot understand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like you, Buckley. It\u2019s just that she </span>\n<em>\n<span>shouldn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> like you. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just when she opens her mouth to protest, Steve starts yelling. \u201cGuys!\u201d Robin realizes they\u2019re frozen in front of them, and Nancy\u2019s unmoving. Her eyes widen. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>We have a situation here</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Robin snarls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI really don\u2019t like this,\u201d Eddie says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJoin the club,\u201d Robin says. She glances over at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only to find his skin melting off his skull. He still wears his obligatory grin, but now it\u2019s something more sinister.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, is that you?\u201d Nancy yells. She\u2019s right where she was only moments ago, except now she isn\u2019t frozen in place. Now, she\u2019s in Vecna\u2019s mind palace </span>\n<em>\n<span>with Robin.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh </span>\n<em>\n<span>double fuck.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the real Upside Down, Eddie stares in horror at Robin\u2019s glazed over eyes. He and Steve lock eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d Steve says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour extensive knowledge of Robin\u2019s music taste could definitely come in handy right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Grandma Wheeler\u2019s voice rings in Nancy\u2019s ears as she stares down Vecna for the second time in a week. </span>\n<em>\n<span>That temper of yours isn\u2019t quite fitting for a lady</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Well, Nancy\u2019s been dealing with this bullshit for three years. And if she\u2019s learned anything in that time, it\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck being ladylike</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease tell me you see the creepy skull man too,\u201d Robin says. Her face is contorted in fear, and Nancy\u2019s heart feels like it\u2019s going to combust. Instinctively, she steps in between Robin and Vecna.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you want from us?\u201d Nancy demands attention now, shoving every ounce of authority she has in her body into her voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe meet again, Nancy,\u201d He simply responds. His voice sends a chill down her spine, and Robin clamps on firmly to her arm. Still, she stands her ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>You let me go</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave you considered what I said?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin blinks at Nancy, and now the shorter girl has to fight to keep her voice even. \u201cWe are </span>\n<em>\n<span>nothing alike</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He laughs, and it seems like the whole world around them is laughing too. His voice reverberates from the rotting trees, and Nancy can all but feel the energy leaving her body. All she wants to do is curl into Robin and cry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI see what you could be, Nancy, if only you let your </span>\n<em>\n<span>fear</span>\n</em>\n<span> stop holding you back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d And as she says it, it\u2019s as if she wills it to be true. As if she\u2019s sculpting this world into something entirely her own. As if she owns his mind palace in its entirety.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d He says. The conviction leaves her body. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of yourself. And you\u2019re afraid of </span>\n<em>\n<span>her</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe?\u201d Robin whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not.\u201d Why is she hesitating, all of the sudden? Nancy logically knows he\u2019s wrong: she likes Robin. She cares about Robin. She can\u2019t imagine her life without Robin anymore. And yet, Vecna\u2019s words send cracks through something in her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou and I always have our toys, don\u2019t we?\u201d Slowly he begins to circle them, like a hyena with its prey. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Steve?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy\u2019s heart sinks. \u201cShut up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t. \u201cYou, Nancy, like to hide behind pretty boys and use them to make yourself happy. And you pretend you don\u2019t like the suffering you create, all the anguish and pain you leave in your wake. But that\u2019s what\u2019s fun about toys.\u201d He stops walking now, having completed a full circle around them. \u201cSometimes, they </span>\n<em>\n<span>break</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d A branch snaps somewhere far away, and Robin jumps. Nancy glances back at her, and her heart twists at the pain in the taller girl\u2019s face. They need to get out of here. \u201cYou just keep lying to yourself, Nancy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLeave her alone,\u201d Robin yells suddenly. She drops Nancy\u2019s arm, and steps out from behind her. \u201cShe is good and kind and</span>\n<em>\n<span> nothing like you</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d One of Vecna\u2019s tendrils shoots out from behind him, and wraps itself around Robin\u2019s throat. It cuts her breath short, and slams her into the nearest tree. She lets out a strangled whimper.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin!\u201d Nancy screams. She dives toward her, but another tendril pushes her back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Venca slowly steps in between the two of them, his ever-present grin covering his face. \u201cEven now, your fear is palpable. You can\u2019t help yourself, can you?\u201d He softly strokes Nancy\u2019s chin, and her jaw clenches. \u201cStop hiding, Nancy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d A voice hisses. Nancy looks over her shoulder, and there\u2019s Carrie Fisher. She blinks. No, </span>\n<em>\n<span>definitely</span>\n</em>\n<span> Carrie Fisher, in Leia\u2019s battle outfit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPathetic,\u201d Another voice sounds. Nancy glances the other way, to see Ally Sheedy in her all-black Breakfast Club look. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ally Sheedy</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Because Carol couldn\u2019t shut up Emilio Estevez, but Nancy just wanted to </span>\n<em>\n<span>be</span>\n</em>\n<span> Ally Sheedy. Or maybe more than that. But she can't admit that to herself. Because that prospect is too\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh, fuck it, </span>\n<em>\n<span>she is scared</span>\n</em>\n<span>. And Robin\u2019s big fucking eyes and soft, earnable smiles are not helping.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI loved Steve,\u201d Nancy snaps. \u201cI love Jonathan! They weren\u2019t just </span>\n<em>\n<span>toys</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd now?\u201d Vecna asks. Her mouth drops open as she searches for words that won\u2019t come. Behind Vecna, Robin gasps as the tendril tightens around her throat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now Nancy knows what to say. \u201cLeave her alone. Please.\u201d She isn\u2019t a beggar, but the fear in Robin\u2019s eyes is enough to bring her to her knees. She can\u2019t take it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Nancy shatters. \u201cShe\u2019d hate me,\u201d She whispers. Somewhere in the distance, Nancy thinks she hears Frankie Valli playing. And tears roll down her face slowly, stinging her skin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Robin whimpers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMore than you hate yourself?\u201d Nancy feels like she\u2019s been punched. Vecna turns away from Nancy now, and starts towards Robin. \u201cYour fear limits you so much.\u201d He reaches a finger out, and brushes a single strand of hair from Robin\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a shame watching one of your toys die because of it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy\u2019s eyes widen. She leaps forward, but Vecna\u2019s foot soldiers hold her back. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>You can\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will. And you can watch.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d Vecna laughs again, and the ground shakes beneath Nancy\u2019s feet. \u201cI\u2026 You can\u2019t do this. Not because of me. Not because\u2026\u201d She glances at Robin\u2019s face, one last time. Because its the last time she\u2019ll respect Nancy, and care about her, and think that she\u2019s good and kind and so </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>like Vecna. \u201cBecause of my stupid fucking crush on her.\u201d She can\u2019t even look at Robin\u2019s face anymore. She just stares at the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The sound of Frankie Valli singing increases so rapidly that it even momentarily shocks Vecna. Only, Nancy realizes it\u2019s not Frankie Valli at all; instead, Steve methodically whispers the lyrics to \u201cCan\u2019t Take My Eyes Off of You\u201d from where she can see him through the small portal that\u2019s opened.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly, Robin rips Nancy\u2019s arm from Zombie Leia\u2019s. She runs in her awkward way towards the portal, holding tight to Nancy. The world is crumbling around them, and the ground shakes violently.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI hate earthquakes,\u201d Robin mumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Nancy says. And for those brief moments, she pretends nothing\u2019s changed. She pretends everything can go back to normal, once they can get out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Robin\u2019s landing on Nancy from about four feet into the air, and Nancy\u2019s lungs ache. The ground of the Upside down is hard beneath the two of them. Eddie and Steve stand only a few feet away and Nancy realizes they\u2019re holding onto each other for dear life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank God,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cOh, Jesus, thank </span>\n<em>\n<span>God.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought I lost you guys\u2026\u201d Steve mumbles. \u201cI thought\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy stands suddenly, and shoves past the two of them. She doesn\u2019t say a word, but she doesn\u2019t have to. Because she\u2019s sure Robin will tell them everything. And she\u2019s sure that\u2019ll be it for her\u2013none of them will want her. She\u2019ll be alone again, just like when Barb died.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She pushes far into the trees. If she\u2019s gonna be alone, at least it\u2019ll be on her own terms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNance, wait!\u201d Robin calls. Nancy knows she shouldn\u2019t, but she stops anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She starts to turn to face the taller girl. \u201cRobin, I\u2019m so sor\u2013\u201d Robin\u2019s lips cut her off. They\u2019re pressed to Nancy\u2019s and so much softer than she ever expected. Once she realizes what\u2019s happening, she melts into the kiss. Her fingers tangle into Robin\u2019s hair, and she goes up on her tiptoes just to be as close to her as possible. Robin tastes impossibly like mint, she decides, and smells like vanilla and cigar and thrift store. And she can\u2019t get enough of it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin\u2019s the one who breaks the kiss, and presses her forehead to Nancy\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize at all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNancy, I have wanted to do that since the library, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you kept talking about Steve\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause I wanted you to know </span>\n<em>\n<span>I</span>\n</em>\n<span> was single!\u201d Robin pulls back, and rests her wrists on Nancy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cNancy, I am a huge fucking lesbian who had to spend a whole day around a really pretty, really bad ass girl who dresses like a middle school librarian\u2013I wanted you to know I wasn\u2019t seeing him in case you decided you were in love with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy looks down. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Yeah</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Nancy smiles, weakly, and then presses into Robin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was so scared you\u2019d hate me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know. I was too when I told Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve knows?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve and Eddie, yeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd they don\u2019t care?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin stifles a laugh, and Nancy can\u2019t for the life of her figure out what\u2019s funny about it. Robin doesn\u2019t even answer the question. Instead, she says, \u201cLet\u2019s go find the boys, okay?\u201d She slips her hand into Nancy\u2019s, and together, they head back towards their friends.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, do you actually think I dress like a librarian?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah! Wait, is that not a good thing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie should not be thinking about Steve\u2019s ass at a time like this. Yet Steve thought it was acceptable to squat and pick up Robin\u2019s comatose body in a pair of jeans, so that she and Nancy could be next to each other. And now, Eddie is partially pacing to think through the situation, and partially pacing to cover up the fact that he\u2019s hot and bothered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe likes, um\u2026 David Bowie?\u201d Steve says. They\u2019re throwing out song suggestions, trying to save Nancy and Robin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, you like David Bowie.\u201d Because of course Steve likes David Bowie. He also probably likes Madonna and Michael Jackson. He\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>basic.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s pathetically in love with someone boring. Maybe Vecna will come for him for </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I drive her everywhere!\u201d Steve says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t pay for gas, she doesn\u2019t get to pick the music! It\u2019s simple.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut not really helpful.\u201d Eddie fusses with his fingers, rolling them around his rings. \u201cWhat about Miss Nancy here? Because clearly the last one </span>\n<em>\n<span>isn\u2019t working anymore</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve just shakes his head. \u201cWe really only listened to music in the car, or like, in my room so\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo remind me to never have sex with you. Got it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> supposed to mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fuck. So much for Robin\u2019s insistence that there was a chance. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Cover, Munson, cover.</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u201cI just don\u2019t ever think railing someone to \u2018Somebody to Love\u2019 by Queen will be my ideal evening.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI like matching pace with the piano,\u201d Steve says. An absolute look of horror must overtake Eddie\u2019s features, because Steve breaks into a grin. \u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan never tell with you, Steve-o.\u201d Eddie glances down at Robin, trying to think about what he knows about her. \u201cShe\u2019s in marching band, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, and she hates band music.\u201d Then, Steve says, \u201cI\u2019d let you pick the music, anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf we, ya know\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre we still on the sex thing?\u201d Eddie waves at the two girls. \u201cBecause, uh, I know I\u2019m hot as fuck and queerer than a 4 dollar bill. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I get it</span>\n</em>\n<span>. But I also really don\u2019t want to watch another girl die this week.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight. Yeah. No more, um, guy talk. Dude talk. Yeah.\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes are right on Eddie, and Eddie has to look away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve coughs lightly, and doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they be floating by now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie checks his watch. \u201cChrissy went full seizure for about\u2026\u201d He looks up at Steve. \u201cTwo minutes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMax probably had a good five in her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve been at this for six minutes now. They\u2019ve lasted longer than most of the guys I know.\u201d Eddie starts pacing again, trying to get his extra energy out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s eyes light up, as they follow Eddie back and forth. \u201cWait, do you think they\u2019re in there together?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs this a reference to my sex joke?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo! I just mean\u2026 like, are they in the same fucked-up brain place do you think?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugs, now hyper-aware that Steve\u2019s eyes are following his every move. It\u2019s intimidating as hell. \u201cI don\u2019t think this guy has it in him to really Scarlet Witch that shit.\u201d From the look on Steve\u2019s face, he\u2019s more confused than Eddie expected him to be about a superhero reference. \u201c...Yeah, yeah I do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve face palms. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of this, </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Robin\u2019s last crush came into Family Video while \u2018Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off of You\u2019 was playing and she wouldn\u2019t shut up about it for </span>\n<em>\n<span>weeks</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFrankie Valli?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah! She told me she just wants it to be, like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>her song</span>\n</em>\n<span> with someone.\u201d Steve quickly looks away from Eddie, his face turning dark. \u201cBut, I mean\u2026 maybe it\u2019ll work, like, solo. I guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Eddie didn\u2019t know, Steve wouldn\u2019t be a bad liar. Mostly because most of the people in Hawkins can\u2019t put two and two \u2014 or girls and girls \u2014 together. Steve\u2019s actually a godawful liar, at least from what Eddie\u2019s seen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll work because she\u2019s with Nancy.\u201d Steve looks up, and Eddie watches his eyes as he slowly starts to realize. \u201cI know about her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Steve nods slowly, and looks down. \u201cDid she tell you about Nancy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA bit, yeah.\u201d Eddie wants to look away, too, because he knows what he has to ask next and he knows he won\u2019t like the answer. But part of him is still holding onto hope. \u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looks down at the girls, and then back up at Eddie. He inhales, and then says, \u201cI like someone else.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s stomach twists in knots. Of course he does. Steve Harrington always has a girl on his arm. Steve Harrington is </span>\n<em>\n<span>straight</span>\n</em>\n<span>. That\u2019s that. \u201cDo you sing?\u201d And something flickers through Steve\u2019s face \u2013 probably relief.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot really.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWeren\u2019t you in the musical?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAren\u2019t you in a band?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want a metal cover of \u2018Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off of You\u2019?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, actually.\u201d Eddie raises his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more of Robin\u2019s vibe anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie wishes he could say he barely remembers the lyrics, but that\u2019s not entirely true. In fact, his mother used to have an old Frankie Valli cassette that she\u2019d play whenever she was home to make dinner for him. He can almost see her now, dancing in the little trailer\u2019s kitchen, even when her skin started to deteriorate.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie turns his head towards the girls, entirely unable to look at Steve. \u201cYou\u2019re just too good to be true,\u201d Eddie starts. His voice is raspy and warm, like the burn of the cigarettes he used to steal from his dad. And it\u2019s comfortable, like his battle jacket. He pulls the jean material in tighter now, and shoves his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou\u2019d be like heaven to touch, I wanna hold you so much.\u201d He twirls his hair around his finger, slowly, trying to calm his racing heartbeat. \u201cYou\u2019re just too good to be true, can\u2019t take my eyes off of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck,\u201d Steve whispers. Eddie glances up at him, his eyes already going wide.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit, man, did I fuck up? I haven\u2019t sang that since my mom died\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo like if the lyrics were so off like, I get it\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie.\u201d Steve puts his hands on Eddie\u2019s arms, but all Eddie can see is Chrissy\u2019s face as she died.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose the girls because I fucked up, </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie!\u201d Steve grabs Eddie\u2019s face, which finally manages to shut Eddie up. Mostly because instead of thinking of Chrissy, Eddie is instead acutely aware of how fucking gay he is. And how badly he wants to kiss Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then, something incredibly peculiar happens: Steve kisses </span>\n<em>\n<span>Eddie</span>\n</em>\n<span>. And he tastes like chapstick and Altoids and Eddie doesn\u2019t even hesitate before kissing back. It\u2019s hard and fast and Eddie\u2019s back is pressed to a tree and his rings are tangled up in Steve\u2019s hair and he is embarrassingly hard and\u2013</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Robin Buckley is suddenly hovering four feet in the air.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie pushes Steve off as fast as possible.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve says quickly. \u201cI just\u2026 you are hot as shit when you sing, did you know that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour turn.\u201d Eddie grabs Steve\u2019s shoulders, and turns him back towards the floating girl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Fuck.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour voice is gonna be better for Frankie Valli. You have to do it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve swallows, hard. And then he starts, his arm wrapping tight around Eddie's waist. Eddie curls into him, feeling him vibrate as he sings. His voice is calculated, smooth. He\u2019s been taught music in a way Eddie hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s unbearably sexy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve is launching into the \u201cI love you, baby,\u201d section when it happens: Robin drops from the sky with the same grace and poise she brings to everything, and Nancy lets out a huff the moment Robin hits her. And before Eddie and Steve can even think to celebrate, the two are off having some elaborate fight in the woods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which means\u2026 \u201cSo,\u201d Steve says. \u201cWe should talk about earlier. While they\u2019re gone, I mean.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie raises his eyebrows. \u201cOr we could just not and like\u2026 keep making out in the woods?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve opens his mouth, and then closes it. He looks at the clearing around them slowly. Then, he says, \u201cDo you maybe still have those handcuffs?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve knows they\u2019re supposed to be saving the world. Logically, that makes sense. But Eddie is doing this thing with his teeth on Steve\u2019s ear and Steve knows there is no way in hell he\u2019ll be able to focus on the apocalypse for a while. Every hero needs to let off some steam sometimes, right?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plus, everyone else had gone home. They\u2019d made it back to the regular world, safe and sound and just in time for a call from Jonathan, Will, and Mike. They were coming to Hawkins in a pizza van, which only made sense to Nancy, and they\u2019d found Eleven, which made sense to no one. They had half a day to themselves until the California crew came crashing through.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And now Steve is in Eddie\u2019s bed, under the pretense that he needs help with his wounds again. That\u2019s what they told the kids, at least; Robin gave Steve a knowing look when she left them. He gave her one right back when she said she was spending the night at Nancy\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s propped up against Eddie\u2019s wall, back in his t-shirt. (\u201cFor your modesty.\u201d \u201cYeah, fuck you.\u201d) Eddie\u2019s lazily draped over him, peppering his neck with kisses and hickies of which Steve isn\u2019t sure he can explain his way out. Every once in awhile, he bites at Steve\u2019s ear and Steve has to aggressively stifle moans.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, about those handcuffs,\u201d Eddie whispers in Steve\u2019s ear. And Steve legitimately thinks he might stop breathing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d he blurts out. Immediately, he regrets it. He\u2019s normally good at this kind of thing. But that\u2019s with girls. And this is Eddie.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie leans back, smiling his shit-eating grin that Steve thinks might be his way of showing affection. \u201cWait a minute: do I make you nervous?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery much so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s face softens. \u201cOh.\u201d He moves to sit next to Steve, and Steve immediately misses the pressure of Eddie\u2019s body on his. \u201cWe can stop if you want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo! No.\u201d He grabs at Eddie\u2019s thigh, and immediately embarrasses himself with his own lack of chill. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Really good. I just\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI haven\u2019t either, you know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s head snaps to look at Eddie. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before, Harrington. Like, not with anyone I\u2019ve ever liked.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, yeah.\u201d Of course he </span>\n<em>\n<span>done</span>\n</em>\n<span> this, though. Dustin\u2019s told Steve all about Eddie\u2019s shows at the Hideout. There\u2019s no doubt in Steve\u2019s mind that Eddie\u2019s picked up plenty of guys there for a quick fuck, the way Steve has with girls at parties galore since freshman year.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that jealousy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo? Maybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, well, Ally Becker was </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> a good kisser three years ago.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThat one might be on me though. Like, surprise! It </span>\n<em>\n<span>wasn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> the braces that made things bad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve blinks. \u201cYou\u2019ve never done anything with a guy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that so hard to believe?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve blushes for probably the first time since he first started dating Nancy. \u201cI mean\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>yeah.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m a whore?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying you\u2019re fucking good at your job.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie rubs a hand across Steve\u2019s stomach, and Steve actually gasps. Slowly, Eddie\u2019s hand comes to slip under the hem of Steve\u2019s shirt. He carefully avoids Steve\u2019s wounds, and instead softly strokes the smooth skin between them. \u201cIs that good?\u201d Eddie whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deep down, Steve knows he knows the answer. But there\u2019s something about the way Eddie says it that has him whispering, \u201cYes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie hums lazily, and leans forward to kiss Steve. This isn\u2019t like their earlier makeout session; no, it\u2019s soft and sweet and slow, like Eddie wants to savor every second of it. And that\u2019s good, as first, until Eddie\u2019s hand slips down to rest on Steve\u2019s thigh. Maybe it's the proximity, or just Eddie\u2019s effortlessness, but soft and sweet is not cutting it. Steve presses into him, a hand fisting Eddie\u2019s shirt. And something palpably changes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve breaks the kiss. \u201cOff,\u201d He says. Eddie blinks. \u201cTake it </span>\n<em>\n<span>off</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Eddie still doesn\u2019t move. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Or I will</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And like that, Eddie is pulling off his shirt and pulling Steve down on top of him. Steve\u2019s shirt becomes another casualty. There\u2019s hands spread flush against soft stomachs and backs and asses.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck, Harrington.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow about those handcuffs, Munson?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie gives Steve a quick peck, and pulls off the bed. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to like\u2026 do anything today. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve nods. \u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d Which is partially true. But part of him can feel himself holding back only because he doesn\u2019t even know what they are. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie unracks the handcuffs, and returns to the edge of the bed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t. Hands?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve holds his out, but before Eddie can cuff him, he takes them from him. Quickly, he turns them and snaps them onto Eddie\u2019s wrists.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie raises his eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, princess?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis.\u201d Steve grabs Eddie, and throws him onto the bed. Eddie gasps, but Steve doesn\u2019t give him time to get flip. He slams his lips into Eddie\u2019s, and straddles his waist. Then, he shoves Eddie back, and puts Eddie\u2019s hands firmly behind his own head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck, Harrington.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo more princess?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot when\u2014</span>\n<em>\n<span>Fuck.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d This last part comes in response to Steve sucking on Eddie\u2019s neck roughly. It starts as payback for the marks on Steve\u2019s skin, but Eddie\u2019s response just makes Steve want to do it more. So he does, working his way slowly to Eddie\u2019s collarbone with each hickey. Eddie\u2019s hands come down to Steve\u2019s shoulders, only for Steve to push them right back up on the pillow without stopping. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>God, Steve.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The image of Nancy moaning that their first time hits him like a freight train. It\u2019s like his brain goes numb, and his pulse starts racing and he\u2019s off Eddie so fast that it's embarrassing. Eddie recoils, and Steve can\u2019t breathe and </span>\n<em>\n<span>You\u2019ll find a nice respectable girl and get your head screwed on right again, son</span>\n</em>\n<span> and he hurt Eddie fuck he hurt Eddie didn\u2019t he\u2013</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve,\u201d Eddie says somewhere far away. Steve needs to get it together, he knows that. He can\u2019t keep freaking out around the guy he likes because of high school shit. It\u2019s just not fair to either of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, sorry, I\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHate yourself for liking a guy and know life would be easier with a woman and desperately wish you weren\u2019t here right now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck, Eds.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie takes Steve\u2019s hand. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d Steve nods, because at least his body feels real again. Even if he doesn\u2019t deserve to hold Eddie\u2019s hand right now. \u201cOkay, Harrington. Why do you think I don\u2019t wanna fuck right now? Spoiler: it sure isn\u2019t because I\u2019m not turned on as hell right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou want to savor the moment?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHa! That\u2019s real cute, Steve-o.\u201d Eddie looks away. \u201cDeep down, I don\u2019t even think I deserve that much. Like, when you kiss me\u2026 I still hear my dad blaming me for my mom\u2019s death. How fucked is that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe said that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course he did. He\u2019s a fucking asshole. But you get used to that feeling. You learn to shove it in a box and push it in a corner and beat it with a bat later. Personally,\u201d Eddie tucks a piece of Steve\u2019s hair behind his ear, \u201cI like to mentally label my box as \u2018shit that Reagan would say\u2019.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo way, you hate Reagan?\u201d Sarcasm drips from his voice, and Eddie grins.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin needs to beat your ass more often.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve smiles and presses his forehead into Eddie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t even notice how much shit my dad\u2019s said about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I get that.\u201d Eddie lifts his face with one hand. \u201cYou know what hankie code is?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin\u2019s told me about it, yeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Slowly, Eddie pushes Steve back onto the bed. \u201cOne of the guys at the Hideout taught me about it, right?\u201d He lightly kisses the bandage over Steve\u2019s side, before moving up towards him. \u201cSo I shoved a bandana in my back pocket and started wearing it to shows.\u201d He slowly pulls Steve into the circle the handcuffs have made with his arms. Steve leans back into him. \u201cOne night, I came home, and my dad just started making jokes about how I was trying too hard to be punk rock and just ended up looking like a faggot or whatever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTold him I actually looked like a faggot because I like dick.\u201d Steve looks over at him, a curious smile on his face. Eddie\u2019s small, shy smile tells him that he\u2019s being 100% serious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat's how you had that conversation?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd everytime I put this bandana in my pocket, I have to choose to shove </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> in the Reagan box.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve smiles, and twists to grab at Eddie\u2019s bandana. It\u2019s not that he hasn\u2019t noticed it before \u2013 in fact, he\u2019s made a bad habit of staring at Eddie\u2019s ass when he shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 but now he can actually make jokes about it without worrying about who\u2019s listening. \u201cYou know wearing it in your left pocket means you\u2019re dominant, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, which of us is the one in handcuffs right now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>By choice.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that a dare?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve thinks about it for a second. \u201cMaybe for later.\u201d Then, he reaches over and unlatches the handcuffs. \u201cI\u2019m kind of too busy with this fucking hot guy right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh? Who?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck you, Munson.\u201d Steve leans into him, giving him a quick kiss.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie softly runs a hand over Steve\u2019s side, and applies just enough pressure to Steve\u2019s healing wound to make it feel better. \u201cAnytime, Harrington.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin\u2019s been to a decent amount of sleepovers in her life, especially since her dad picked up the nightshift at the plant her 8th grade year. Anymore, to avoid dealing with all the drama at home, she just crashes at Steve\u2019s place. His parents think they\u2019re dating, which makes for quality entertainment, especially when his dad jokes that Robin will \u201cget Steve\u2019s head screwed on straight.\u201d From the conversations she\u2019s had with him the last few days, she\u2019s pretty sure her influence has helped Steve be anything but </span>\n<em>\n<span>straight</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Wheeler\u2019s house is the exact opposite of the Harrington\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stopped for dinner first, but Nancy seemed weird the whole time. Robin wondered if it was because of the kiss, if Nancy regretted it. Her anxieties are somewhat eased when they get back to her house.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Nancy\u2019s mom snaps the second Nancy walks through the kitchen door. \u201cNo, don\u2019t answer; I don\u2019t actually care. You\u2019re grounded.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe was with me,\u201d Robin pipes up from her spot in the door frame. Karen Wheeler looks impossibly more confused. \u201cI\u2019m Robin. Buckley. We have class together.\u201d She glances over at Nancy, racking her brain for a comprehensive lie about the last two days. Every time she looks at Nancy, she can\u2019t shut up; so why is it that her words aren\u2019t forming </span>\n<em>\n<span>now</span>\n</em>\n<span>?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard the news about Eddie Munson, right?\u201d Nancy says. She raises her eyebrows at Robin, and she slowly puts two and two together. \u201cShe was with him the night Chrissy died.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin smiles nervously. If she could pretend to be a professional psych student, she can fake this. \u201cLike, we were together after the </span>\n<em>\n<span>game</span>\n</em>\n<span> and we hung out all </span>\n<em>\n<span>night</span>\n</em>\n<span> and so, when they announced they thought he did it, like, I was </span>\n<em>\n<span>really upset</span>\n</em>\n<span> and scared and I asked Nancy if she could come stay with me.\u201d Okay, so not as put together as she would\u2019ve hoped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy frowns. \u201cAnd I was upset because of Fred, so when she called, I felt like it\u2019d be better to be with her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Karen\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cYou could\u2019ve called. There is a killer on the loose and\u2026 And did you two tell the police any of this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey didn\u2019t believe us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Karen\u2019s eyes shoot to her daughter, and the concern in them is palpable. Robin starts inching towards the stairs. \u201cUh-huh. Robin, how\u2019d you meet Nancy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019s dating Steve,\u201d Nancy says. Robin has to physically fight some form of response to her crush accusing her of dating her best friend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd we just kept crossing paths,\u201d She says instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe agreed to tutor me for French.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin lights up. \u201cI speak four languages, actually. Steve and I learned Russian last\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy takes Robin\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll be upstairs.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, um, It was nice meeting you!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And they make a mad dash for Nancy's room. By the time they make it, Robin\u2019s fighting back giggles as she collapses on Nancy\u2019s bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe hates me,\u201d Robin says. She grins up at Nancy, who\u2019s far from smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust me. At all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you have been hanging out with a wanted murderer all weekend.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot funny.\u201d Nancy sits down on the bed next to Robin, her shoulders slumped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin sits up, slowly, and elbows Nancy\u2019s side. \u201cDon\u2019t let it get you down. Moms are, like, meant to be horrible.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBarb\u2019s mom wasn\u2019t.\u201d Nancy glances over at Robin, and Robin can see the tears in Nancy\u2019s eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou really miss her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy shrugs, and glances down at her lap. \u201cI think sometimes I just feel guilty.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin gulps. Her mind is racing with all of the things she can tell Nancy, but she can\u2019t escape the nagging feeling that, no matter what, she\u2019ll come back to the same question. \u201cThat\u2019s why Vecna targeted you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Nancy nods, soundlessly. Her eyes are dark, sad. Robin bites her lip; she so dearly misses Nancy\u2019s smile. \u201cI used to hate you, you know. When you and Barb first became friends. Because I was her best friend, until you came along.\u201d Nancy glares at Robin. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Okay, get to the fucking point</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Robin thinks. \u201cBut you were a much better friend to her than I ever was.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy shakes her head and looks away. \u201cShe\u2019s dead because of me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause of a flesh-eating monster, actually.\u201d Robin swings her feet back and forth under Nancy\u2019s bed. \u201cYou heard Vecna: he wants you. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh baby, oh baby</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Nancy breathe-laughs. </span>\n<em>\n<span>An improvement</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cNo matter what you did, no matter how hard you tried, the Upside Down was going to try to hurt you. That doesn\u2019t make it your fault.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI left her!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo did I!\u201d Nancy\u2019s head swings to look at Robin. \u201cI just let her go! Because I was jealous. Because I was </span>\n<em>\n<span>scared</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Because I </span>\n<em>\n<span>liked girls</span>\n</em>\n<span> and I thought that meant no one would ever truly be able to like me. But guess what? If I had done something \u2013 anything! \u2013 to keep her in my life, then maybe I would\u2019ve been there that night. Maybe I would\u2019ve gone home with her when you left.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen you can\u2019t blame yourself for what happened.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy opens her mouth to say something, and then she closes it. She quickly glances at the closed door. Without hesitating, she cups Robin\u2019s chin and kisses her. It\u2019s something short and soft and sweet, but it leaves Robin in a mess of fireworks. Her mouth shifts into a shellshocked smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJonathan and I broke up over the phone today,\u201d Nancy says. \u201cJust so you know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin blinks. A bit of her thought she\u2019d be the silly little gay fling forever. A bit of her thought she deserved it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI told him I was sick of never talking. And that I was mad he didn\u2019t come to see me. And he told me he\u2019s been lying to me for two months straight. So. I broke up with him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. Are you okay?\u201d Part of Robin isn\u2019t sure she wants to know the answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But then Nancy nods, slowly. \u201cI think\u2026 I think I knew this was coming basically since he left. He had this whole idea that I would drop everything for him. And even though he didn\u2019t want that, it pissed me off that he thought I would ever just up and abandon my dreams. I want to be with someone who actually challenges me.\u201d She glances slyly at Robin now. \u201cWho thinks I can be challenged.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin flops back onto the bed, her brain trying to form cohesive thoughts about this newest development. \u201cI\u2019m not going to Emerson with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank god.\u201d Nancy flops down right next to her, and looks over at her. Robin seriously cannot process how beautiful Nancy\u2019s eyes are, or how intense they look right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, so you want me gone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMake me.\u201d God, Robin has always wanted to say that. Back when she used to steal her mom\u2019s bodice-rippers after class, she\u2019d picture a tall dashing man \u2013 while, it was a man in fifth grade \u2013 taking her by the throat and forcing her into a silence driven by passion and lust and violence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now, tiny Nancy Wheeler lightly presses her lips to Robin\u2019s. She kisses her slowly, sweetly, with just the right amount of tongue. And Robin isn\u2019t sure she\u2019ll ever again be able to form the words to speak.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin\u2019s eyelashes flutter, and she takes a light breath. Nancy smiles. \u201cIf I had known it was that easy, I would\u2019ve kissed you days ago.\u201d Robin pushes her shoulder lightly, and Nancy smoothly slips her hand into Robin\u2019s. This has to be fake. Robin turns various shades of red, and then drops Nancy\u2019s hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d She mumbles, burying her face in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t normally\u2013\u201d The phone rings next to the bed. Robin jumps. It clicks to signal someone else in the house picking up, but Robin still feels entirely too on-edge.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her instinct proves somewhat correct when Mrs. Wheeler yells up to the room. \u201cNancy, hon, it\u2019s for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy sits up slowly next to Robin, her eyes wide. Slowly, she reaches for the bedside phone and picks it up. She gestures for Robin to get close to her, so they can both hear from the tiny speaker.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello?\u201d Nancy says. And then she adds, \u201cMom, get off the line.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNancy?\u201d She doesn\u2019t recognize the voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, um\u2026 Bill. Beau.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Bilbo.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Eddie. Robin and Nancy share a look. \u201cI\u2019m calling because\u2026 look, um\u2026 Just be ready. I\u2019ll be there in ten. It\u2019s Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s van might be the most confusing contraption Nancy\u2019s ever been in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The very structure itself is strange: it\u2019s a barely-functioning tin box, with outdated shag carpet that goes across the floor and up the walls. And where there absolutely shouldn\u2019t be seats in the back, there are the mauled remains of what might\u2019ve been recliners, nailed into the floor. The walls are decked in posters and a hand-installed stereo system, which dutifully bangs out something loud and heavy and actually kind of </span>\n<em>\n<span>good</span>\n</em>\n<span>. D&amp;D supplies and McDonald\u2019s wrappers clutter the floor, and a few demo cassettes float between the seats. It smells weird, too, like nice cologne and cigarette smoke; nothing like what she anticipates from Hawkins High\u2019s most prolific weed dealer, even if that dealer is someone as strange as Eddie.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What really seems surprising to Nancy right now, though, is Eddie\u2019s behavior.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pulled up only five minutes ago, with a terrified look on his face and Steve lying on his back in the back. After all the work they\u2019d been through to keep Eddie hidden, Nancy thought it must\u2019ve been a cruel prank. Until, of course, Eddie opened his mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He tried to say through the open window. \u201cHe just\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie, you need to tell us what happened,\u201d Nancy commanded. Steve let out a groan from the back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt got\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fuck,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Steve managed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe have to get him to a hospital,\u201d Eddie said. He couldn\u2019t look Nancy in the eyes, and his skin was so incredibly pale.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ll be arrested,\u201d Robin said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not leaving him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which is why Nancy is driving now, with Robin in the passenger seat. And she doesn\u2019t understand why Eddie\u2019s being so sweet with Steve, cradling Steve\u2019s head and telling him he\u2019ll get through it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTell me the story again,\u201d Nancy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t rabies?\u201d Robin asks Eddie instead. \u201cThe incubation period is really similar\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie glances up at her. \u201cRobin, I\u2019ve seen rabies. This isn\u2019t it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, boy scout.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy elbows Robin. \u201cGive me your story. Now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight. So. Steve and I were heading to his place because his parents were gone, and Eddie tagged along.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd why did Eddie tag along?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, they\u2019re gonna ask! You two aren\u2019t friends with Eddie.\u201d No one could link Eddie and Robin or Steve together, like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>ever.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Unless, of course, \u201cSay you wanted to get high.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee, I don\u2019t like smoking because it makes my brain go all weird and, like, fake\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! Lie!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWeed wouldn\u2019t show up on our drug tests,\u201d Eddie cuts in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s silence in the front seat for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t smoke?\u201d Nancy asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah, dude.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAren\u2019t you literally a drug dealer?\u201d Robin asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Eddie runs a hand through Steve\u2019s hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy the fuck would you sell drugs if you don\u2019t do them?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCorrection, I do </span>\n<em>\n<span>drugs</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Eddie grins up at her. \u201cJust not weed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy would you sell then?\u201d Nancy asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI grew up in a trailer park, Wheeler. You get a bit of a rep from that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKids knew I had easy access to shit and I was poor enough to need the money. Now, can you focus on getting us to the fucking hospital?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy glares at the road, and grips the steering wheel tighter. \u201cYour car\u2019s a piece of shit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh huh, I know.\u201d They take a turn and Steve lets out a sharp groan. Eddie\u2019s face contorts in panic. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Hey, hey, look at me. Stay with me, Harrington</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Nancy glances at Robin, who doesn\u2019t look at all confused by this situation. By Eddie Munson begging Steve to stay alive, or holding his face, or preparing to spend his life in jail for the boy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe he\u2019s just more loyal than Nancy could ever be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll say Steve wanted weed,\u201d Robin says. \u201cAnd he cut his side up pretty badly when he was high.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd then he still goes to jail?\u201d Steve whimpers out. Eddie and Robin share a look, and Nancy suddenly feels extremely out of the loop.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSay you invited me and Henderson,\u201d Eddie cuts in. \u201cAnd Dustin bailed at the last minute, but I didn\u2019t want to seem rude.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, fine.\u201d Robin waves in Steve\u2019s general direction. \u201cWhat do we say about this\u2026 whole thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey\u2019ll know about it,\u201d Nancy says. Eddie and Robin share a look. \u201cJust\u2026 trust me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve tries to shift into a sitting position, before curling back down. Eddie lightly presses down on his shoulders. \u201cMy veins are black, Nance.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy\u2019s eyes widen. Visions of Will in the hospital and in the shed fill her brain. The sounds of his screams in the night still haunt her dreams if she thinks too hard about that night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cD-does that mean something?\u201d Robin asks. Sometimes, Nancy forgets that that was before Steve and Robin were Steve and Robin. Before she felt a sharp twinge of jealousy when she saw them together. Before she realized that was because she liked girls, and not because she still liked Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe second time,\u201d Steve starts. He inhales sharply, and glances up at Eddie. \u201cThe second time we fought this shit, it got Will. And his veins started turning black.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d Nancy says, now, as she picks up her speed a bit. She wishes Hopper was there. She wishes things were going to be okay in Hawkins for once.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But if things were okay, she\u2019d be dating Steve and marrying him after high school and never escaping Hawkins. Never getting more than Enzo\u2019s on a Saturday night, and cigarettes and beer from the gas station when they could afford it. Never getting to hold Robin\u2019s hand across the center console of a beater van with Eddie \u201cThe Freak\u201d Munson\u2019s headbanger music blasting out all around her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She takes Robin\u2019s hand now, and gives it a squeeze. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Can you hold on that long? We\u2019re almost there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve suddenly twists forward, and throws up in a McDonald\u2019s bag. Nancy thanks her lucky stars they aren\u2019t in her car, as she watches Eddie hold back his hair in the rearview.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGet the ugly out, there you go.\u201d He glances up, and catches Nancy\u2019s eye in the mirror. The urgency on his face scares her more than anything else in this situation. It's the kind of urgency she\u2019s come to know in her years of monster hunting: the kind that comes only when someone is really, truly, terrified to their core.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie, what happened?\u201d She asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He frowns, and glances down at Steve. \u201cHe was fine. We were, um\u2026\u201d He pauses, and Nancy can almost feel him struggling to find the right word. \u201c...Hanging out in my room. And then all of the sudden, he froze. And his face went white, and\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd the veins around my bite turned black.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s the hivemind thing we were telling you about,\u201d Nancy says. \u201cSometimes, when the Upside Down hurts you, it\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMakes you part of it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna have like, a baby demogorgon pop out of his stomach, is he?\u201d Robin asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDemogorgon?\u201d Eddie cuts in. \u201cLike the D&amp;D character?\u201d And then, to Steve, he says, \u201cOkay, atta boy. Let\u2019s get you back down.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s what we call some of the monsters that come out of the Upside Down,\u201d Nancy explains. She can see Hawkins General in the distance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou guy really let fuckin\u2019 Henderson name this shit, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey were flesh-eating monsters, Munson. You have a better idea?\u201d But his focus is back on Steve. Nancy catches Robin repeating their story to herself over and over again. Like she\u2019s willing it to be true.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They pull into the hospital, then, and Robin jumps out of the car. She runs straight for the Emergency Bay, and Nancy can\u2019t help but remember that the taller girl once told her she never runs, not ever. </span>\n<em>\n<span>But these are the things we do for the people we love</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then it finally clicks. Eddie\u2019s in the back, promising Steve he won\u2019t leave him. Their proximity isn\u2019t uncommon for the two of them; maybe that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t catch it until now. But the insistence on staying with him, the willingness to risk prison for his life, the fearful pause between \u201cwere\u201d and \u201changing\u201d. It all makes sense in the light.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As the paramedics shove Steve onto a gurney, and security guards fight to pull Eddie away from him, Nancy feels like she\u2019s watching a movie. Only, this would never happen in a movie, because she wouldn\u2019t be with another girl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And her ex, the famed King Steve, wouldn\u2019t have fallen for another boy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They took the clock off the wall in the hospital ward when the power grid got fucked after Starcourt Mall burned down, and never replaced it. Nancy told them it was because some of the doctors from Hawkins lab moved to Hawkins General, after the closure, and did what they could to cover up the Upside Down within local medicine. So now, Eddie isn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019s been sitting here, but it feels like hours. He can\u2019t usually read the numbers on his watch face, and now he can\u2019t even focus enough to try. Far in the distance, past the waiting room and the doors and the security detail, he can hear chanting and yelling. He knows, despite the intangible nature of it all, that it\u2019s because of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two officers sit in the seats on either side of him. He recognizes one as the new interim sheriff, only from Newspaper photos and War-On-Drugs local newscasts. The other, rocking what Eddie thinks is an awesome mustache, seems to be his right-hand man. Robin sits across the aisle from him: only Nancy was allowed back, after she begged a few former Hawkins Lab doctors to let her come.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The cops keep asking questions, but, strangely enough, neither of Hawkins\u2019 finest particularly seem convinced Eddie was involved.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m getting coffee,\u201d The sheriff says. \u201cDo any of you want some? Actually, I\u2019ll just get four cups.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He heads off down the hall, and leaves Eddie, Robin, and the other cop in silence. Eddie squints to read the guy\u2019s name tag, like he always has to squint to read the blackboard: Callahan. Then, he takes a piece of his hair and runs it past his cheek.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I go check on Steve?\u201d Robin asks suddenly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you tell us the truth?\u201d Callahan snaps back. Robin curls in on herself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously, dude?\u201d Eddie says. His stomach twists at the sight of Robin\u2019s face. She already struggles with eye contact, but now she won\u2019t even look at either of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018dude\u2019 me.\u201d Callahan crosses his arms. \u201cI know all about you, Munson. We\u2019ve got a file three inches thick on you back at the station.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen you know he didn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>do any of this</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Robin cuts in. She glances up at them for just a moment, and then looks away. Eddie can\u2019t help but smile at her little display of bravery.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Callahan hinges towards her as he speaks. It\u2019s definitely not as intimidating as he thinks it is. \u201cThen who did?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAn evil wizard from an alternate dimension?\u201d Eddie offers. He raises his eyebrows at Robin, and sticks out one of his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will cuff you,\u201d Callahan threatens. He\u2019s a real Bonnie Fife.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll probably be turned on, just warning you in advance.\u201d Callahan turns red, and looks down at his feet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just then the Sheriff \u2013 Powell, from his name tag \u2013 comes back with hands full of coffee. He hands one to Callahan, first, and then hands off two to Robin and Eddie. \u201cYou guys seem like the kind of kids who like a lot of sugar in your coffee,\u201d He says as he drops them in their hands. Robin holds it with two hands, and takes a sip. She smiles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you,\u201d She says. Eddie just sets his on the floor. There\u2019s a dull empty ache in his stomach.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, what\u2019d I miss?\u201d Powell asks. Callahan glances over at Eddie quickly, and then back at Powell.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were talking about how, uh,\u201d Callahan blinks quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow a dark wizard from an Upside Down world did this,\u201d Eddie finishes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Powell says, but there\u2019s hesitance behind his sarcasm. He blinks a few times, regaining his composure, and then looks over at Callahan. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t cuff him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow else do you explain what happened?\u201d Eddie says suddenly. \u201cSteve\u2019s side is turning black! And\u2026 And someone killed Chrissy fucking Cunningham, who, unlike her boyfriend, was everything good and pure and </span>\n<em>\n<span>right</span>\n</em>\n<span> in this world.\u201d Her smile flashes through his mind and he gulps. All of the sarcasm he normally welds disappears. \u201cAnd I saw Patrick float out over the water,\u201d Eddie continues. Callahan and Powell instantly look to him. His heart skips a beat. \u201cLike, he was ten feet up in the air. And I couldn\u2019t do anything to help him or\u2026\u201d He starts to lose his composure. \u201cOr stop him from\u2026\u201d Eddie squeezes his eyes shut, trying not to think about Chrissy and Patrick\u2019s bodies snapping out of place.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFrom what?\u201d Callahan says lightly. Robin soundlessly slips to the floor of the hallway, so she can take Eddie\u2019s hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe just\u2026 his jaw\u2026\u201d And now Eddie\u2019s sheet white and shaking. \u201cIt was like he was getting, like, vacuumed in. Or sucked dry. Or\u2026 fuck\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then the door at the end of the hallway bursts open. Two people shove through, despite the security detail at the front door. Eddie recognizes both of them for two vastly different and not particularly positive reasons. The first is the woman that he saw on TV all too often his first senior year. The second used to come around the trailer park to see him sometimes and tell Eddie to get better about containing the whole drug-selling business.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Callahan stands up suddenly, his and Powell\u2019s eyes wide as saucers. Because Jim Hopper is very much supposed to be dead, but instead he\u2019s standing next to Joyce Byers and staring down his former employees with a look of intense disappointment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou detained fucking Eddie Munson?\u201d Hopper asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joyce puts a hand on Eddie\u2019s shoulder, and he instinctively leans into it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re alive?\u201d Robin asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere\u2019s Will?\u201d Joyce asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Right when Eddie decides he\u2019s had enough questions, Powell responds, \u201cNot here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hopper and Joyce share a look. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan we just back up and address the fact that he\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>still alive</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Robin says in her typical loud way. Eddie\u2019s breath hitches. Everything is too loud, too bright, too much; his vision\u2019s turning white and his ears are buzzing and he just wants to run again. Joyce\u2019s hand tightens lightly in his shoulders, grounding him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to find our kids,\u201d Hopper says. Then, he adds to Robin, \u201cIt was the Russians, kid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joyce glances between the two officers. \u201cWe borrowed a walkie talkie to pick up Will\u2019s radio, but Dustin said something about him, and the hospital, and\u2014\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s Steve,\u201d Robin cuts in. \u201cNot Will.\u201d Joyce visibly exhales. \u201cWill\u2019s supposed to get here from California tonight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow\u2019d you even get in?\u201d Callahan asks suddenly. Every eye in the room whips towards him, except for Eddie\u2019s. His stay glued to the floor in front of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe door?\u201d Hopper offers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin tilts her head. \u201cDid you guys just walk past the angry mob or\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMob?\u201d Joyce asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of murder,\u201d Eddie speaks up for the first time, his breathing shaky. \u201cSo there\u2019s that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou accused fucking </span>\n<em>\n<span>Eddie Munson</span>\n</em>\n<span> of murder?\u201d Hopper says. \u201cJesus, Powell.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Callahan adjusts his glasses and leans back on one leg. \u201cWe found a mutilated body in his uncle\u2019s trailer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Jane\u2019s kid, here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about </span>\n<em>\n<span>Hawkins, Indiana</span>\n</em>\n<span>, here,\u201d Joyce cuts in. \u201cYou know what\u2019s happened here over the last four years, and your first course of action is to arrest a </span>\n<em>\n<span>kid</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Powell sighs. \u201cHe ran from the cops, Joyce.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s a mob outside demanding his </span>\n<em>\n<span>head</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was not our fault,\u201d Callahan says. Joyce glares at him. \u201cJason Carver went around tellin\u2019 everyone Munson had demonic powers, or something, because of that fucking board game.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait,\u201d Joyce says, \u201cIs this about D&amp;D?\u201d There\u2019s a telling silence. \u201cYou really accused a boy of murder because he plays D&amp;D?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, not </span>\n<em>\n<span>just</span>\n</em>\n<span> because of that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChrist!\u201d Joyce yells. \u201cYou both knew Janey\u2014we all used to smoke the same cigarettes under the bleachers. And Phil, I </span>\n<em>\n<span>know</span>\n</em>\n<span> she used to patch you up after soccer practice. So why in hell would you arrest her </span>\n<em>\n<span>son</span>\n</em>\n<span> because of\u2014of a harmless board game! My kids play D&amp;D! My son, Will, when he was bullied mercilessly, when you </span>\n<em>\n<span>did nothing about it</span>\n</em>\n<span>, had nowhere to go but to his D&amp;D friends!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t really do anything\u2014\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was </span>\n<em>\n<span>vandalism</span>\n</em>\n<span>. And you did nothing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJoyce\u2014\u201d Powell starts. The look on her face shuts him up pretty quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChrissy and Patrick\u2026\u201d Eddie speaks up suddenly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just D&amp;D. Like, they both </span>\n<em>\n<span>died </span>\n</em>\n<span>in front of me.\u201d He looks up, heart pounding in his chest. \u201cNot because of me. Like, I watched them float up in the air and\u2026 And their bones just\u2026 God, I don\u2019t even know. It just\u2026 they were </span>\n<em>\n<span>twisted</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s what Jason said,\u201d Callahan offers. \u201cBut he blamed your demonic cult powers, if I recall correctly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie snorts. \u201cI wish.\u201d Then he looks up. \u201cFuck, sorry, I just\u2026 trust me, if D&amp;D gave me magical powers or something, </span>\n<em>\n<span>you\u2019d know</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s this town, and that goddamn lab,\u201d Hopper says. \u201cWhy do you think there are doctors here who know how to treat this kind of thing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve\u2019s veins were black,\u201d Robin points out. \u201cNancy just brought us here on a whim.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs she back there with him?\u201d Hopper asks. Robin nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHas she talked to Jonathan recently?\u201d Joyce jumps in. Robin\u2019s eyes go a bit wider as she nods again, and Eddie can\u2019t help but wonder if Robin was a bit more successful with her crush than she might\u2019ve anticipated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEveryone was meeting up at my uncle\u2019s,\u201d Eddie offers. \u201cWe just, uh, had to make a pit stop. Obviously.\u201d He waves his arm around, gesturing to the corridor. Joyce\u2019s still rubbing soft circles on his shoulder, just the way his mom used to. He feels far more alive, now. Far more like Eddie \u201cThe Freak\u201d Munson.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing back there?\u201d Hopper waits for a response, and when none comes, he adds, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Jesus</span>\n</em>\n<span>, people. I guess I\u2019ll go check on him.\u201d Callahan and Powell share a look, and then quickly follow after him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then, it\u2019s just Eddie, Robin, and Joyce. Robin keeps her spot on the floor, but Joyce paces to the other side of the hall to lean against the wall. Eddie pulls his legs into his chest and looks up at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you. For defending me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joyce smiles softly, and looks down. \u201cMy son, Will, told me once about this really cool guy who used to scare off anyone who tried to put Zombie Boy posters up in the high school.\u201d Eddie blushes. \"I kind of suspected that it was you, from how long I knew your mom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJaney was the best of us. We all thought her and Henry were gonna get out of this place. Only we all forgot one thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHenry.\u201d Eddie laughs for what feels like the first time in a long time. It\u2019s a weird sensation, to no longer miss your father, but it\u2019s a welcome one. \u201cI wish we\u2019d been closer in the end,\u201d Joyce continues, \u201cBut Lonnie and Henry were still so close\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd still such assholes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joyce smiles, and instead of answering, she just says, \u201cThat\u2019s what Janey always said.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I remember. I think when she got sick she just kind of\u2026 Gave up on leaving him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, Eds, is your mom </span>\n<em>\n<span>dead</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Robin blurts out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, I literally live with my uncle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, well, I lived with my grandma for two years when my dad didn\u2019t have a job, </span>\n<em>\n<span>so</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Once again, Eddie\u2019s somewhat shocked by how much Robin can comfortably overshare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe didn\u2019t give up, ya know,\u201d Joyce cuts in. \u201cShe was saving up to move you guys out of this hell hole before\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe started AZT trials.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin blinks up at Eddie. \u201cOh,\u201d she whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d They all said his mom was lucky, getting AZT during the earliest drug trials. But she paid a steep price to do it; and so did he.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the distance, a hospital door slams, and Hopper comes back into the hallway. He\u2019s smiling lightly. Eddie notices the patchy buzzcut he has, which is ever apparent under the fluorescents. Then, he says, \u201cThey got it out of him.\u201d Joyce is the only person who looks relieved; Eddie and Robin just stare at Hopper in utter confusion. \u201cSteve\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d Eddie can feel his entire body relax. And to add to the relief, Hopper says, \u201cI convinced those idiots to let you two go in there, if you want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie and Robin are shooting down the hall before Hopper can stop them. Until they feel the impending heat in the hall. Slowly, both kids slow, and swap a look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, I am the king of broken air conditioning, but what the </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me! I joined this whole program while it was way in progress. Like, we already had a good trilogy under our belts.\u201d They stop in front of the room from which the heat seems to be radiating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, fingers crossed, then.\u201d And Eddie pushes open the door, to find a perfectly normal hospital room, and Steve slumped in the bed. Nancy stands by an open window, smiling at the door. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Smiling at me</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Eddie realizes. There\u2019re no nurses or doctors around right now, so Eddie smirks up at her and says, \u201cEither someone has a crush on me, or Nancy Wheeler has put two and two together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can hold his hand if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, Munson,\u201d She snaps back with a smirk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, so we\u2019re finally acknowledging how fucking fruity we all are?\u201d Robin asks. She wraps her arms around Nancy\u2019s waist, and Nancy leans into her. Eddie blinks. Robin really </span>\n<em>\n<span>was</span>\n</em>\n<span> successful, shit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve moans quietly in the bed, his eyes still glued shut. Eddie smiles at him, and watches him from a distance. Eddie slowly slips his leather jacket out from under his battle vest, and drops it on the floor next to the bed.Then, after a moment, he also slips his shirt off from under the battle vest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMiss Nancy,\u201d He turns around, arms crossed to cover his bare chest, \u201cWhy exactly am I sweating my ass off in here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She waves towards Steve, and breaks away from Robin. Even by the window, they\u2019re still both sweating. \u201cYou have to sweat Upside Down infections out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, of course. Obviously.\u201d He curls his fingers into a fist, and holds it near his chest. \u201cIs there any way we can cool this off now that he\u2019s, uh, magically cured?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy glances at the window, and then back at Eddie. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She slips out the door and, with a quick glance at Steve, Robin scampers after her. Eddie watches them go, then turns his attention to the hospital bed. The room is impossibly too hot to cuddle with Steve, so Eddie just moves to awkwardly hover at his side. He runs a hand through Steve\u2019s sweat-drenched hair, and watches the IV slowly drip into Steve\u2019s arm. Eddie hates hospitals, and has since his mom passed. Every visit reminds him of her last days, and the few times he saw her fail to help the kids she knew.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s chart pokes straight up by his bed, and Eddie squints to read it. There\u2019s two infections noted on there, and Eddie frowns just a bit. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have tried to get you drunk,\u201d Eddie mumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were trying?\u201d Steve whispers. Eddie legitimately jumps.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck, Stevie!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve cracks a small, wounded smile. \u201cStevie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s hot as fuck in here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugs. \u201cYeah, well, you literally had to sweat the devil out. And I think you\u2019re already running a fever\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause you got me drunk?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie just wants to punch him and tell him </span>\n<em>\n<span>no, you just fucking suck at caring for infections</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Instead, he leans down and gives Steve a quick kiss. \u201cYeah, Stevie. Because I got you drunk.\u201d And then the air conditioning kicks on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>Steve spends the next day in and out of consciousness, and Eddie never leaves his side. His body still feels weird, and it can easily be written off as the antibiotic drip making him woozy. But part of him knows it\u2019s his brain is readjusting to the amount of real-estate it can take up in Steve\u2019s body. Every stolen touch from Eddie helps \u2013 everywhere his hands roam when no one\u2019s looking makes Steve want every inch of his skin back for himself.</p>\n<p>His physical healing is uncannily quick, and the hospital offers to discharge him once he spends more time awake than he does asleep. The cops offer to drop Eddie\u2019s charges, too\u2014Hopper\u2019s reinstatement takes only as long as it does for Joyce to find the rules on special elections for sheriff at the library. Steve thinks they\u2019ve pumped too much morphine into his body when he first sees Jim, but everyone gets him up to speed.</p>\n<p>And then he ends the night again in Eddie Munson\u2019s bed, while they prepare for the impending battle. Steve sleeps a lot, lulled by the rustle of his friends breezing through the trailer every once in a while. His arms ache for Eddie\u2019s figure, but only Nancy and Robin know about them. He isn\u2019t quite prepared for this secret to get out there just yet.</p>\n<p>Finally, the next morning, Robin wakes him up softly before the sun comes up. \u201cHow you feeling, cowboy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCowboy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYa know, because you\u2019re into leather now?\u201d Steve punches her arm. She grins. \u201cAttaboy. You think you\u2019re down for the fight today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I need to get dressed.\u201d Steve doesn\u2019t get dressed. He doesn\u2019t move. Instead, he wakes up hours later to Dustin at the end of his bed\u2014Eddie\u2019s bed. Dustin\u2019s hair and clothes are a mess of dirt and blood and torn armor, and when he finally speaks, Steve thinks he might still be dreaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and Eddie. We lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>And its Dustin\u2019s words now that leave Steve in a freefall, send him spinning headfirst into the little time the last few days provided. \u201cHe stopped running.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because they both know what he means. Because otherwise Eddie would be there himself. Because the world is still cold and cruel and set up to ruin everything Steve could ever try to build for himself.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t move for another day. Robin has to force food down his throat, and even then, he can tell she wants to curl into herself and give up, too. There\u2019re tears cried until there aren\u2019t tears left to cry, and water chugged so that there\u2019re more tears to cry. Mike asks Steve how he and Eddie knew each other, and Steve thinks his chest might just cave in.</p>\n<p>\u201cVecna got away,\u201d Steve says suddenly. Robin\u2019\u2019s curled into his side, and she startles when he speaks. Looking back on it, he isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s done that in a day. \u201cEddie\u2019s fucking gone, and Vecna\u2019s still fucking out there, and we couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin pulls him into her chest, and he\u2019s sobbing again. Big huge screaming sobs that shake both of them and pull at everything Steve has left. He wants to die. He wants to swap places with Eddie. He wants to have woken up and gotten dressed and won the goddamn battle by his boyfriend\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>Because of course they\u2019d be boyfriends now, wouldn\u2019t they? Steve would pop the question just as easily as he did with Nancy and they\u2019d live happily ever after. And Eddie would get his diploma. And they\u2019d leave this cursed town for ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did I apply to Scoops,\u201d Robin whispers, as Steve starts to regain his composure. \u201cI could\u2019ve gone my whole life not knowing about alternate dimensions or brain suckers\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe worst burden of them all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin kisses his forehead, and mumbles, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to stop working at Family Video.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the second day, Nancy joins them in Eddie\u2019s comically small bed, curled up between Steve and Robin. It\u2019s a bit strange at first, thinking that he\u2019s third-wheeling with his ex-girlfriend and her new S.O., but it\u2019s also one that he\u2019s used to. And it doesn\u2019t change their dynamic one bit: they all hold onto each other like there\u2019s no hope outside of that room alone.</p>\n<p>On the third day, Steve sees his second ghost in the last week.</p>\n<p>He wakes up before the girls, all of them still intertwined in Eddie\u2019s sheets. Steve can\u2019t help but reminisce on how Freshman him would give him now a high-five. The thought alone makes him nauseous.</p>\n<p>Slowly, Steve extracts himself from the situation, and sneaks out into the kitchen. His feet feel weird pacing on solid ground after so much time spent in the bed.</p>\n<p>He digs through the limited supplies in the kitchen, managing to extract some coffee grounds from their groceries. He sets to work, putting together Wayne\u2019s old Mr. Coffee and filling it up. He leans against the counter and hits start, and then his sobs once again shoot through his body.</p>\n<p>Someone wraps their arms around his waist, and pulls him in. For a minute, Steve can\u2019t help but think about how much they all smell like Eddie\u2019s smoke and soap after all their days in his house. And he\u2019s pleasantly reminded of the comfort Eddie\u2019s arms used to offer, even if they sent him reeling at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Steve whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Eddie whispers back.</p>\n<p>On instinct, Steve spins around and punches Eddie right in the nose. He watches Eddie stumble back, waiting for him to melt into the zombies all of his friends have struggled with in Vecna\u2019s mind palace.</p>\n<p>Only, he doesn\u2019t. Instead, he just clutches his bloody, broken nose, and swears softly under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell, Harrington,\u201d He mumbles. \u201cWhen I said I liked it rough, I didn\u2019t mean like <em>that</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve goes dead still. \u201cHoly fuck. Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured.\u201d Eddie grabs a dishrag off the counter and presses it to his face. Then, he smiles at Steve. \u201cDo you know how many bats I had to fight off to get here? This hero shit <em>sucks</em> man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Within seconds, Steve pulls him into the biggest hug Steve Harrington might be capable of. Because its <em>Eddie</em> and he\u2019s <em>okay</em> and Steve\u2019s just <em>a little bit in love with him</em> already. And he can\u2019t stop himself from saying all these things, because this is it. Vecna hasn\u2019t won. Eddie\u2019s home safe and sound and in Steve\u2019s arms again and they can always just turn up the heat if he\u2019s hurt.</p>\n<p>Eventually, they have to wake Robin and Nancy. They have to call the rest of the party. They have to tell Wayne, who isn\u2019t at all surprised \u2013 \u201cEddie, son, I have known you your whole life, and you\u2019ve never been anything but a survivor,\u201d \u2013 and Joyce and Hopper, who are. And everyone knows the battle must go on another day, til they can close the gates and take down Vecna for good, but there\u2019s something about it. About Eddie and Steve and Hopper <em>surviving </em>it all that makes it so much more manageable in everyone\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>It also means, though, that everyone must get ready. Spring break\u2019s coming to a close. The kids \u2013 Everyone but Steve \u2013 have classes to prepare for and chores to do. And after a light celebration, everyone has to go home and face the right-side-up world.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you wanna stay?\u201d Eddie asks Steve. He stands at the front door, watching everyone leave. Steve wonders if he\u2019ll ever tell any of them about him and Eddie. He hopes they last long enough that he can.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He loops an arm around Eddie\u2019s waist, and he\u2019s impossibly smitten with how well they fit together. He\u2019s impossibly smitten with Eddie, too, and maybe that\u2019s why he loves this so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you mean it, earlier?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve looks over at Eddie, but for all the studying he\u2019s done of the boy, he can\u2019t make out his expression. \u201cMean what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you were a little bit in love with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Of course that\u2019s what he meant. Because Steve fucked up. Because Steve moved too fast. Because Eddie wasn\u2019t in love with Steve and now it\u2019s going to ruin everything. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t, like, wanna push you or anything, it was just a comment and you were alive and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, it\u2019s okay!\u201d Eddie glances over at Steve, and, for a brief moment, Steve feels somehow as if he\u2019s looking in a mirror. The logical side of his brain wins over and tells him he most definitely isn\u2019t. Then, Eddie nuzzles his face into Steve\u2019s neck. \u201cI fought killer bats to get to you,\u201d He whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I am ridiculously, stupidly, in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too, prison boy.\u201d Eddie laughs against Steve\u2019s skin, and Steve instantly knows how much he means it.</p>"
