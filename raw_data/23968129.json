  "text": "<p>Lan Zhan pauses at the entrance to his walk-in wardrobe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It should be just another part of his day, another one of the motions he goes through without having to put any thought to it. Just like waking up every morning at exactly thirty seconds to five, exercising on his balcony, taking a shower and sitting down to practise the qin by six.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not an ordinary day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks around the shelves lining the walls on all four sides. All his clothes are arranged methodically, each category with its own section. Button-up shirts, turtlenecks, jumpers and cardigans, coats, slacks in varying shades of white, light blue and tan, and so forth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDo you have a catalogue? You have to! There\u2019s no way you don\u2019t have an actual catalogue.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales. Thinking about Wei Ying every time he gets ready to go to his best friend\u2019s house is a pointless exercise, but he\u2019s given up trying to fight it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like the jolt of heat that will always rise to his ears at the thought of Wei Ying. He waits patiently with his hand on the doorknob for it to pass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is only because Lan Zhan hasn\u2019t been to Jiang Yanli\u2019s flat in weeks. Or, as a consequence, seen <em>him</em> in weeks. He only needs to see Wei Ying once, remind himself how annoying he is and everything will be just fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(It won\u2019t.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan takes out a blue turtleneck sweater and a cream cardigan to wear over it. He pairs it with tan slacks and steps in front of his mirror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had tried to branch out a bit the last time he\u2019d placed an order on Secoo. He really had. Pictured a certain insufferable boy with cheeky eyes, tongue poking through his mouth as he bent over Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder, scrolling down his app and loudly commenting on each of the clothes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite imaginary Wei Ying\u2019s best efforts, Lan Zhan\u2019s order had ended up fitting just right in his wardrobe. Full-sleeved, high-collared and heavy on the powder blue and white tones as always.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is a little known fact that Lan Zhan does, in fact, care quite a lot about how he dresses. Jiang Yanli knows this, of course. After all, she\u2019s his usual shopping partner whenever they meet for brunch at Nanjing Road. Responsibly sourced, ethically produced fashion as far as possible, but luxurious and painstakingly selected nonetheless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So all things considered, it makes sense that Wei Ying still thinks his outfits are fuddy-duddy, his colour scheme drab. They\u2019ve never had anything in common, so it\u2019s just as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second person who knows just how particular Lan Zhan can be about his wardrobe is his brother. If he\u2019s noticed the time Lan Zhan takes to get ready spike every time he heads over to Jiang Yanli\u2019s house, at least he has the good grace not to mention it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s not enough to stop him from smiling at him over his cup of coffee when Lan Zhan emerges from his room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, brother,\u201d says Lan Huan. He\u2019s smiling so widely his eyes look like half-moons. Lan Zhan bristles. \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods. He makes a beeline for the shoes rack, eager to leave before\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes every shred of discipline Lan Zhan has to stop to give his brother a curt nod in acknowledgement. Even when every instinct in his body is telling him to walk away at once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought out the Santal Blush, too,\u201d continues Lan Huan, after a deep inhale. \u201cMust be somewhere really special.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am going to Yanli-jie\u2019s,\u201d Lan Zhan grits out. \u201cTo film,\u201d he adds pointedly, hitching his bag full of filming equipment a little higher on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt her flat?\u201d says Lan Huan, eyes twinkling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Lan Zhan resignedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d says Lan Huan. \u201cAlthough, those sandalwood notes of your cologne - while <em>very</em> lovely and intense - good choice, brother... I don\u2019t think they\u2019re quite strong enough for your channel\u2019s viewers to catch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales. Here it comes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless,\u201d says Lan Huan, \u201cThe reason for all this is at your friend\u2019s flat instead? A person, perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turns fully towards him. He resists the urge to glare at him, but only just. \u201cI don\u2019t know, brother,\u201d he says. \u201cYou seem perfectly capable of drawing your own conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Huan smiles. \u201cI\u2019m sure A-Ying will appreciate the effort,\u201d he says. \u201cIf he was aware he is the target audience, that is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tries to ignore the way his stomach turns. Appreciate the effort? He\u2019s already made a massive fool of himself once before. He isn\u2019t about to repeat that mistake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>That</em> had all started after one particular movie night last year at Jiang Yanli\u2019s flat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan has no recollection of the actual movie, of course. Because midway through the movie, Wei Ying had walked in out of nowhere and sank right next to him on the couch. Like it was <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like he hadn\u2019t just made Lan Zhan undergo the 21st century equivalent of qi deviation in the space of three seconds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking back, he had to wonder if he ever thought while growing up that he would end up this way. Twenty years old and <em>grateful</em> for Wei Ying\u2019s terrible posture, because this way his foot was on his thigh. He even kept bursting into that easy, carefree laughter that had made Lan Zhan feel like there were flowers blooming in his chest, or some such ludicrous metaphor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no way Lan Zhan would have caught even a word of the whole movie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That is, till Wei Ying had clutched his arm and whispered, \u201cOh my god, he looks so cool in that jacket!\u201d Lan Zhan had finally torn his attention away from him, and really looked at the television. Equal parts to burn a hole into the actor\u2019s face on the screen with his glare, and also to take pointers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One week later, he\u2019d showed up to Jiang Yanli\u2019s flat in a light washed denim jacket over a white turtleneck and white jeans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan!\u201d she\u2019d said as she\u2019d looked him up and down, slightly bemused. \u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The jacket had been rather stiff and the jeans were too tight. But it was a small price to pay if Wei Ying would look at him with a fraction of the admiration he\u2019d had on his face for the actor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There had been a loud crash behind him at that moment, and Lan Zhan had turned around to find Wei Ying standing at the foot of the stairs. Frozen in place and staring at him, with half of a watermelon on the floor in front of him, splattered messily everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d started to cough, then. Still looking at Lan Zhan. Red in the face from his coughing fit, he had turned right around and flown up the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ridiculous. That\u2019s what Lan Zhan must have looked like, trying to mimic the actor on screen who\u2019d caught Wei Ying\u2019s eye. Of course, Wei Ying wasn\u2019t cruel enough to have laughed outright.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Callous, perhaps, but still considerate towards things that really mattered, empathetic, wonderful, <em>perfect</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it was fine. He\u2019d mourned the watermelon instead. If it weren\u2019t for him and his pathetic attempts at trying to look like someone Wei Ying should give his time of day, Wei Ying would still be eating that watermelon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had always loved watermelons.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks himself back to the present. His brother could smile knowingly all he liked. Wei Ying is happy this way. Living his life the way he is meant to, bright and carefree with no spilt watermelon to ruin his day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan puts on his shoes quickly, back carefully turned to his brother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His brother\u2019s voice comes from right behind him. There\u2019s a different edge to it, and it makes Lan Zhan pause with his shoelaces between his fingers to listen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His brother is still smiling, but there\u2019s a crease between his brows. \u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan knows what he\u2019s talking about, of course.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you, brother,\u201d he says, and gets up to leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan waits outside the door to the Jiang\u2019s flat. As usual, he\u2019s prepared for the worst.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first time Wei Ying had answered the door in tiny shorts and a massive T-shirt that barely skimmed the bottom of them, they were sixteen years old. He\u2019d started to dress particularly shamelessly around the house by that time, although Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t entirely sure if he noticed it then because his own feelings about it had changed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan starts. Jiang Yanli is standing in front of him, holding the door open. She steps aside with a smile to let him enter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Jiang siblings\u2019 flat is large and airy, with three bedrooms on the upper floor leading down by a staircase the living room and kitchen area. They live minutes away from the university campus, unlike the flat Lan Zhan shares with his brother. It takes the Lans a good twenty minutes to come to class in the morning, while from here it\u2019s a five minute walk even if you were being leisurely about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s just as well. At least this way Wei Ying ends up attending <em>some</em> of his early morning classes, even if he enters at least fifteen minutes too late.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweating,\u201d Jiang Yanli chides gently, when she gets a good look at Lan Zhan. She takes out a piece of cloth from a drawer and dabs at his forehead with it. \u201cDid you really need to wear all these layers? It\u2019s April, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The turtleneck Lan Zhan is wearing under his cardigan is far too form-fitting. Of course he needed it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He makes a huff in protest as Jiang Yanli pulls it off his shoulders, but he is pretty warm. It\u2019s a relief to be rid of it. His turtleneck still shows his torso off in too much definition for his liking, but it\u2019s only him and Yanli-jie here. She\u2019s always made him feel comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes the glass of icy cold water that she presses into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, you can help me make lunch and we can film it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said the show is at four, right? The gallery is in Chaoyang, so taking the traffic into account - we should be okay if we leave by three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCool, come with me for a second then - I have something to show you. You\u2019re not too hungry, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, brother made pancakes for breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a coincidence - so did I,\u201d says Jiang Yanli, as Lan Zhan follows her up the stairs to her bedroom. \u201cI also ended up eating all three servings of it, since A-Cheng and A-Ying for some reason decided to wake up at four in the morning today, of all days, and go swimming at the university pool. They fell right back asleep afterwards, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is open at that time?\u201d asks Lan Zhan, a pang of something ugly shooting through him. How many years has it been since he\u2019s swum in the same pool as Wei Ying? How many times has Jiang Cheng gone swimming with Wei Ying in that time?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s being ridiculous again, of course. Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng are flatmates. <em>Brothers</em>, too. If anything, Lan Zhan should be happy that Wei Ying has started to swim again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he is. Wei Ying was born to swim, of course. Just not with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d says Jiang Yanli. They\u2019ve entered her room, and she motions him over to sit on her bed. She bends over her desk, rummaging for something. \u201cI think A-Cheng planned to, then he must have knocked something over while getting ready and woke A-Ying up. A-Ying probably complained, and A-Cheng must have told him it was his fault he\u2019s too delicate to deal with being up so early and of course, A-Ying saw it as some sort of challenge. Or something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods. That does sound a likely chain of events.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have called me,\u201d he says. Jiang Yanli\u2019s magic fingers could make even pancakes taste like they belonged on the menu of a Michelin star restaurant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli turns around, beaming as she pinches Lan Zhan\u2019s cheek. \u201cI know, I know. You would have come, too, even if it was only to help me finish my pancakes,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan lets her squeeze his cheek between her fingers longer than he\u2019d ever have allowed his brother to. Firstly, because she\u2019s Jiang Yanli and not his brother. And secondly, because he\u2019s still thinking how it would be to run into Wei Ying over breakfast again. Clingy and whiny-voiced as he always is right after he wakes up, complete with bedhead and his too-large pyjamas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d says Jiang Yanli triumphantly at last. She has a small diary in her hand. Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes grow wide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat diary...\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s our\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Jiang Yanli. She gets on the bed facing Lan Zhan, and places the diary between them. They both stare down at it for a while. \u201cWell, are you ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods, and she opens the diary to the first page.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the yellowed page in fading ink, they\u2019d written their names. <em>Jiang Yanli</em> in her big, loopy hand and<em> Lan Zhan </em>below it in his spindly, microscopic lettering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli had pasted dried lotus petals around their names but they\u2019d crumbled to dust to some point. The tape and light stains on the paper remain, and Lan Zhan runs his fingers over them absently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was ten years old at the time, and she was twelve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Best</em> friends, Lan Zhan used to secretly think. But he\u2019d never tell her that, of course. He was just the kid she\u2019d started talking to at swimming camp two years ago and occasionally hung out with on weekends. It was only convenient, since they lived on the same street.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli was friendly and kind, loved by everyone who knew her. She was gentle, well-read and quiet too, nothing like the kids in his class who had never read Cao Wenxuan or would probably gag if they tasted tieguanyin tea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then one weekend, when they were browsing through a book store in their neighbourhood, she\u2019d said \u201cA-Zhan, guess what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had glanced up at her from the book he was flipping through. She was still a full three inches taller than him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She\u2019d shown him a diary. It wasn\u2019t like the others, with written directions and places for you to fill. Lan Zhan didn\u2019t understand why those were so popular. He was always being taught what to do. Why would you choose that even for a personal diary for your thoughts? A blank space was what you needed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And this one had been perfect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan, do you want to make a best friend memory journal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t been sure how to react to that. \u201cBest friend?\u201d he\u2019d repeated quietly, after a while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re best friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she\u2019d said, squeezing his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had a lot of questions. <em>How</em>. <em>Why</em>. <em>Out of all her friends </em>- every one of them more interesting than he was - whom she could choose to be best friends with?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d nodded eagerly, not willing to let the opportunity go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the diary between them on Jiang Yanli\u2019s bed thirteen years later, Lan Zhan finds himself half hoping they had never found it. He treasures his best friend, of course. So many of his fond memories of growing up have happened thanks to her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, there are things that he\u2019d much rather forget.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But this may be good. Possibly cathartic. Perhaps revisiting the memories would be a good way to remind himself how ridiculous and embarrassing certain aspects of his childhood were.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reaches forward and turns the page.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As they pore through the first few pages together, he almost forgets why he was wary of looking at the diary. The corners of his lips turn upwards in a small smile as he flips through pages filled with items pasted on them, a reminder of the times they\u2019d spent together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They find a pair of ticket stubs to the first movie they\u2019d seen at the cinema hall together. \u201c<em>Cinderella Moon,</em>\u201d Jiang Yanli says with a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, A-Zhan, no one will ever know you cried at the ending. I don\u2019t think anybody would believe me even if I told them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s ears go pink. \u201cI was ten,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes you were,\u201d Jiang Yanli says with another laugh, and they move to the next pages.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They find a checklist they\u2019d made of things to do over the summer: books to read, films to watch and cafes to try. Then Lan Zhan skips a section of the journal by accident, and a page opens up with handwritten notes pasted on it. Notes they\u2019d passed during a particularly long guqin lesson at the music school they went to on weekends, years ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers freeze over the frayed, yellow paper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembers how startled he\u2019d been to find quick fingers slip the note between his sheet music. He\u2019d turned to find Jiang Yanli giving him a sheepish, yet pointed look. Perhaps the Jiang siblings were not quite so different after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s A-Ying\u2019s fourteenth birthday this weekend. You\u2019re coming, aren\u2019t you?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan would up end up going, of course. He always did. For no reason other than it would upset Jiang Yanli if her best friend didn\u2019t turn up for her beloved little brother\u2019s birthday.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, well - if you were being technical about it, he had already spent weeks choosing an appropriate present. Wei Ying was loud and annoying, and his favourite pastime seemed to be teasing Lan Zhan at every chance he got. If he was going to have to attend his party, Lan Zhan would make sure his present was good enough to shut him up for the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he\u2019d done his recon, blithely steering conversations with Jiang Yanli till she\u2019d disclosed Wei Ying\u2019s deepest desire at the time. It was a new dizi after he\u2019d broken his last one, and Madam Yu had refused to get him a new one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you really... is that\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And for once, it had worked. Voice trailing off into speechlessness, Wei Ying had stared at the beautifully crafted bamboo dizi - painted black, with a dark red knot. Then he\u2019d looked up at him. Eyes sparkling, a lovely blush on his cheeks (<em>Lan Zhan did that!</em>), and a smile that most definitely had not made Lan Zhan feel like heart was close to bursting right out of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except - that had not been all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan jolts back to the present. Jiang Yanli is looking at him with an unreadable expression on her face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head, and moves his hand to turn the page. To his surprise, her hand falls on his.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she says softly. \u201cMaybe you could take it home, and go through it on your own time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan searches Jiang Yanli\u2019s face swiftly. She\u2019s never mentioned anything to make him think she suspects his less than appropriate feelings for Wei Ying. Still, older siblings had a way of unnerving you. Like they could see right through you, maybe even down to the particularly shameful thoughts he\u2019d had about bending her beloved baby brother over every surface in this house.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eager to change the subject, he nods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli pushes the notebook towards him and gets to her feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we head to the kitchen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan rolls up his sleeves. Next to him, Jiang Yanli takes off her bracelet and places it to the side along with Lan Zhan\u2019s watch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan steps around the counter to the camera, bending over it to check that the counter is in view. When he\u2019s satisfied with the angle, he comes around next to Jiang Yanli again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe spring onions are washed,\u201d she tells him. Lan Zhan takes a pair of scissors from the stand and starts to snip at the stalks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They settle into an easy rhythm. Jiang Yanli washes the vegetables and divides them between them to chop up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did your uncle have to say about your latest piece?\u201d she asks after a few minutes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe seemed to like the tracking shots for the scene I filmed at Zhongshan park,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cBut he said that some more low-angle shots would have made the climax better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHigh praise, coming from him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan knows this. Award-winning documentary filmmaker turned professor Lan Qiren is an impossible man to please. So when he doesn\u2019t have twenty critical things to say about a three minute scene, Lan Zhan knows he\u2019s impressed him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t so sure his uncle would appreciate how he\u2019s been practising, though.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan glances at the viewfinder of the camera pointed at their hands working on the counter. To this day, he isn\u2019t sure why 2.6 million people follow his channel and religiously watch his content when all he does is film himself going about his day. He never shows his face or speaks a single word and ignores all emails from companies trying to sponsor his videos. Those were the things that made you famous on social media platforms, weren\u2019t they?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yet - here he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d really only made his channel to serve as an archive for personal reference. The first video he\u2019d uploaded was a year back - something he\u2019d filmed for an assignment. An ordinary Saturday in his life starting with guqin practice, playing with his bunnies, spending the afternoon at a bookstore, studying at a coffee shop and then coming home to make dinner. He hadn\u2019t bothered to tag the video, so it had taken a few weeks for people to notice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few shout-outs from famous \u201caesthetic lifestyle channels\u201d later - whatever that meant - he\u2019d found himself with twenty three thousand followers and two thousand new comments overnight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d told no one but Jiang Yanli about it, and she\u2019d promised not to let out his secret. Not even to her brothers. So his channel had grown and grown, his subscribers coming in by the thousands every week to watch Hanguang-jun film his everyday life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A year has passed and he still doesn\u2019t quite understand it, but at least it\u2019s decent filming practice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan,\u201d says Jiang Yanli, \u201cThe soup looks almost done, would you mind calling A-Ying to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan splutters. He blames it on the smoke from her stir frying. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you mind calling A-Ying?\u201d she repeats, louder. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely still asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying...\u201d says Lan Zhan carefully, \u201cIs home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes - I told you, didn\u2019t I? He came home from swimming and fell right back asleep without breakfast. A-Cheng napped a bit too, but he woke up a while back to meet Huaisang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is home. He\u2019s here. Sleeping. In his pyjamas. In his bed. Where Lan Zhan is supposed to wake him up from.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind the closed door,\u201d Jiang Yanli tells him as he sets down the knife. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably have to go inside. He usually needs an extra push to wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tries very hard to act like his brain hasn\u2019t just blown a fuse at the thought of going inside Wei Ying\u2019s room and waking him up. It\u2019s not even the first time he\u2019s been in Wei Ying\u2019s room, which makes it worse. He should definitely not be this affected by the mere suggestion, but it\u2019s not like his brain has ever cooperated when it came to Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He holds up quite well till he\u2019s out through the doorway and taken a few steps down the corridor. Once he\u2019s sure Jiang Yanli can\u2019t see him, he stops dead and lets out a shuddering exhale.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, this is happening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a few steps further and stops in front of Wei Ying\u2019s door. He recognises the stickers, but that\u2019s only because he had looked them up on Baidu using search strings he\u2019d rather not remember.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(<em>animated human-pig hybrid character. maroon cartoon boar. five member idol group spiked hair leather</em>\u2014)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan focuses on the problem at hand. He needs to wake Wei Ying. A sleeping Wei Ying, which means he\u2019s at his most whiny, clingy and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014<em>Cute</em>, he thinks. Lan Zhan passes a hand over his burning face. He hasn\u2019t even walked inside yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He raises his hand to the door in preparation to knock. He runs through what he\u2019ll say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHello, Wei Ying.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re not on the phone. Besides, he can\u2019t even see him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWei Ying, lunch is ready.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That just makes him sound like he\u2019s his mother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWei Ying. It\u2019s me.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No - too casual.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWei Ying, it is I.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That sounds like an invitation for Wei Ying to call him stuffy or fuddy-duddy. Although, if he\u2019d say it in his soft, sleepy, petulant voice, Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d even mind too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a clatter from the kitchen, and Lan Zhan starts and knocks on the door in a knee-jerk reaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, it is I,\u201d he calls out automatically, and winces inside. \u201cYour sister wants you for lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>As do I,</em> he thinks before he can help himself. Breakfast and dinner too, and possibly every other meal for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fact that he\u2019d even had that thought is so mortifying that he has to do <em>something</em>, so he pushes the door open. The first thing he sees is Wei Ying sprawled diagonally across his bed on his front, fast asleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turns his face to the side as he walks to the side of the bed. Wei Ying\u2019s shirt has ridden high enough up his torso to bunch up nearly around his armpits. It feels wrong to look at him now that he\u2019s here,</p>\n<p>especially when not a single thought in his head right now is appropriate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He glances around the room instead. Maybe it\u2019s not quite what Jiang Yanli had in mind when she\u2019d sent him to wake her brother up, but he\u2019ll probably never get the chance again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan has always been used to pristine, sparse places. Everything Wei Ying\u2019s room isn\u2019t. Every inch of his room is lived in, unquestionably <em>Wei Ying</em>, with the piles of clothes lying around, his dizi on the table and stickers and pictures on every surface.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes linger a moment on the dizi. It\u2019s the same one Lan Zhan had handed over to him on his fourteenth birthday. Wei Ying used to have a terrible track record before, breaking them on an average of once a year. He\u2019d probably just grown up after that, but still - it was Lan Zhan\u2019s gift that had survived.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan allows himself a self-indulgent moment watching it lie in the middle of Wei Ying\u2019s everyday mess.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He runs his gaze then over the pictures on the walls. Wei Ying had brought most of them from his old room in the Jiang\u2019s house: pictures of his favourite punk rock bands, comic book and cartoon characters, photos of him with his friends, his siblings and his pets. Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes roam, subconsciously searching till he stops at that one picture of himself with Wei Ying after a tournament.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His fifteen year old self is glancing sideways at Wei Ying in it, as he grins widely back. Lan Zhan can\u2019t help the wave of relief that washes over him to find it still pasted right in front of his desk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A soft snore reminds him of his task at hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, still trying his hardest not to look at him. There\u2019s no response at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, it is one thirty in the afternoon,\u201d he tries again, louder. Still no response</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He exhales. He really had been hoping it wouldn\u2019t come to this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Face averted, he reaches out in Wei Ying\u2019s general direction and gives him a gingerly prod.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A split second later, he realises to his horror that what he\u2019s touching is bare skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Out of the corner of his eye, he finds his fingers skimming Wei Ying\u2019s bare hip, just above the waistband of his low-slung pyjamas. He pulls his hand away as if it\u2019s on fire, but he\u2019s too late.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stretches - his lean, lithe swimmer\u2019s body arching off the bed as he groans softly into the mattress. Then he rolls over lazily and blinks directly up at Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turns a full hundred and eighty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d says Wei Ying. His voice is just like Lan Zhan remembered from the few times he\u2019d run into a sleepy Wei Ying when he\u2019d come over for breakfast with Jiang Yanli. Soft, raspy and cracking slightly around the edges.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also solid and <em>real</em>, inches behind him, complete with the image of his bare torso that had forever been seared into his brain even in that split second. His shirt had ridden up so high that if he skimmed the edge of it with his fingers he\u2019d probably brush his nipples\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBreakfast,\u201d he says stiffly, before that mental picture can progress any further. \u201cReady.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perfect. He sounds like a caveman. Exactly the way you\u2019d like to sound addressing the love of your life when he\u2019s half naked and squirming in his bed barely a foot away from you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs again. \u201cLan Zhaaan.\u201d His voice is soft and whiny as he says his name, and Lan Zhan is only human.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns around. Wei Ying smiles lazily, stretching again. His body rolls and twists and arches off the bed shamelessly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well - maybe that\u2019s not entirely true. Maybe it would have been a perfectly innocent series of body movements on anyone else. People stretched when they woke up, didn\u2019t they?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome for breakfast,\u201d he says shortly, before he can project any more of his own shameless feelings onto Wei Ying. Then he turns to leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He freezes, halfway to the door. \u201cLan Zhan ah Lan Zhan, you never look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The statement is so ludicrous, it sends a prickle of irritation under Lan Zhan\u2019s skin. It\u2019s almost two in the afternoon, just how asleep is Wei Ying still?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop wasting your sister\u2019s time,\u201d he says before he steps towards the door, more harshly than he\u2019d intended. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019ve been looking at you since we were eight years old</em>, he doesn\u2019t say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli doesn\u2019t like eating before everyone\u2019s at the table, so they wait. When Wei Ying enters, he\u2019s still in his pyjamas. His hair sticks out in every direction, but at least he\u2019s washed his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is the first to reach for the spoon and dip it into the soup, with perhaps a fraction more force than was necessary. He\u2019s aware of Jiang Yanli giving him a look, but he doesn\u2019t make eye contact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was practice today, A-Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is grateful for the way his best friend never presses him, waiting instead for him to tell her whatever\u2019s on his mind in his own time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, good. Jiang Cheng really improved his butterfly, you know! He beat me on one of our laps, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sounds far too happy and proud for someone talking about how they\u2019d been beaten in a race. It\u2019s absolutely, definitively, devastatingly <em>Wei Ying.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan realises with a start that there\u2019s soup dripping from the spoon he\u2019s forgotten on the way to his mouth, hovering above his bowl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Cheng went out a few hours ago,\u201d continues Jiang Yanli, and Lan Zhan is thankful for it because maybe no one noticed. \u201cWhat are you up to after this, A-Ying? <em>This</em> includes a bath, by the way,\u201d she says with a dimpled smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-jie, what can I say? You know how I am when I just wake up. It\u2019s just so hard to move, especially after all those laps... Lan Zhan didn\u2019t even wait long enough to carry me to the bathroom. He didn\u2019t even wait to listen to me.\u201d Wei Ying crosses his arm, pursing his lips like a petulant child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The whole universe shrinks to two entities: the blood rushing in Lan Zhan\u2019s ears, and Wei Ying\u2019s voice saying, <em>carry me to the bathroom.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, Wei Ying is just trying to get a rise out of him as usual. As usual, it works. Lan Zhan feels the tips of ears grow hotter at each replay of his voice, completing with an image of carrying a sleepy, half-naked Wei Ying in his arms. This isn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he does what seems the next most appropriate step. He pops a whole chilli in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli reaches out to touch his back in alarm. Lan Zhan splutters, holding a hand to his mouth. It was a perfect plan. Absolutely foolproof. You\u2019d never be able to tell if the flush spreading down to his toes was thanks to the chilli, or something else entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except what he hadn\u2019t factored in is that his tongue is on fire, his eyes are watering and his whole throat right up to his chest is burning. He\u2019s decidedly <em>not</em> having a good time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli presses a glass of ice cold water in his hand. With some effort, he raises it to his lips and gulps it down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The haze before his eyes clears, and the first thing he sees is Wei Ying. He\u2019s staring directly at him with an unreadable expression on his face, chopsticks clenched tightly in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d says Jiang Yanli.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods stiffly, back to looking anywhere but at Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the meal passes in relative peace. Or as much as Lan Zhan could ever expect with Wei Ying across the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Yes, yes, I did that yesterday - only needed one pair of non-ripped jeans because that I\u2019m on thin ice with that one professor. Not everyone takes half a day to select a single button-up shirt! In Lan Zhan\u2019s case, you literally have two colour options to choose from!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014So it\u2019s extra cool, A-jie, because Jiang Cheng hasn\u2019t beaten me at butterfly ever! Lan Zhan here is the only who\u2019s ever beaten me before, this poor weakling body of mine just doesn\u2019t stand a chance against those big, rippling muscles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Ah - sorry, sorry, won\u2019t happen again <em>- if only</em> I had a friend like you have to drive me to places in his nice, big, sensible car, maybe it wouldn\u2019t matter if I kept forgetting my subway card!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan focuses on his meal, trying to recall the notes he\u2019d been studying earlier in his head. It\u2019s better this way. Nothing good could come from rising to Wei Ying\u2019s bait again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re done, Jiang Yanli gently wheedles Wei Ying back to his room for a bath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you had just carried me into the tub after I woke up, Lan Zhan, I would have been bathed by now,\u201d he sighs as he leaves the kitchen, with a lingering glance at Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan focus very intently on replaying in his head the notes he\u2019d been revising that morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Aspect ratio is the size of the screen image measured by its width and its height.

He\u2019s relieved to find that Wei Ying has left the room, leaving only Jiang Yanli with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think we should head out now?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods, and gets to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>They sit side by side on the train. Through the window opposite, the city flies by as they make their way to M50 district. The route takes them past the French Concession, one of Lan Zhan\u2019s favourite parts of the city, and he films the passing scenes for several minutes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy with the footage?\u201d Jiang Yanli asks as he puts the camera back into his bag.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cThink so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They settle into a comfortable silence again. For Lan Zhan, that doesn\u2019t last long. His brain seems particularly loud today. Memories he\u2019d pushed back earlier when they\u2019d been going through the journal start to resurface.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014So the rest of us will hide, and the first one that the blindfolded person finds and can correctly recognise will be the next to get blindfolded, and that\u2019s how it continues!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been a few hours after he\u2019d placed the dizi in Wei Ying\u2019s hands at his fourteenth birthday party. Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d ended up hiding in a corner of a dark room in the Jiang\u2019s house. The game had sounded pointless, he\u2019d been hot and sweaty and it had been fifteen minutes to his usual bedtime. He couldn\u2019t wait to leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Wei Ying had been excited about the game. And he\u2019d volunteered to be blindfolded first. The thought of him stumbling across somebody in the dark and feeling up their face had made Lan Zhan\u2019s stomach start to coil unpleasantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been stewing in the jumble of thoughts in his head, when the floorboards had creaked. It was Wei Ying. Wei Ying, about to enter the room he\u2019d been hiding in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had frozen in place, heart hammering in his chest so loudly he was sure Wei Ying would be able to hear him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know someone\u2019s here,\u201d Wei Ying had said, grinning. His arms had reached out as he\u2019d walked further inside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the moonlight filtering through the window, Wei Ying had looked lovely. Messy hair tied in a short ponytail, loose strands framing his face and lips stretched into a blinding smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Wei Ying had come too close. Close enough to touch him. If he recognised Lan Zhan - which he would,\u00a0 he\u2019d be stuck playing this stupid game. It was close to his bedtime already, even if it was mortifying to admit to a party full of teenagers. Lan Zhan needed to get home. He had to go to bed by nine so he could wake at five to practise qin at six\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Wei Ying\u2019s lips had looked very, very soft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had lunged forward, grabbing Wei Ying\u2019s face in his hands and pressed his mouth to his. Hard, clumsy and furious, till he was sure he\u2019d never be able to dream about anything else other than how sweet and soft he felt against his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was also enough to leave Wei Ying flushed, breathless and dazed, and for Lan Zhan to slip away unnoticed and out of the house.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d Jiang Yanli\u2019s soft voice next to him on the seat of the train to M50 district makes him start. \u201cYou spaced out for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shakes his head. Jiang Yanli gives him a gentle smile and doesn\u2019t question any further.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>When Lan Zhan returns home that evening, he films himself playing with his bunnies for a while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His viewers love his bunnies. Of course, they also enjoy his arms, his hands, or the outfit details he shoots in the mirror from his neck down once in a while. They\u2019re extremely vocal about it, too. But the appreciation for his bunnies pleases Lan Zhan, and that\u2019s the only thing he\u2019ll include gratuitous footage of in each of his vlogs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s one part of that train of thought that isn\u2019t completely accurate, of course. There is one commenter he actually does pay a significant amount of attention to. Even the <em>arm</em> comments, even if nobody else knows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hours into his first video going viral a year ago, Lan Zhan had turned off email notifications for his channel. The last thing he was interested in was what hordes of strangers on the internet had to say about him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>A few weeks and a couple more vlogs later, he\u2019d opened his latest video to check the formatting and caught an accidental glimpse of the most upvoted comment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had simply been: <em>arms</em>, followed by an eyeball emoji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The name of the user had been <em>yilinglaozu</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing Lan Zhan had done after that was to slam his laptop shut. He\u2019d got to his feet, paced three times around his room and then sat down at his desk again. He\u2019d turned his laptop on, opened up his browser window to his vlog and checked the comment right on top of the page.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu (4 hours ago):</strong> <em>arms</em>, and the eyeball emoji,</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d taken a deep breath, put on his coat and shoes, gathered one of his bunnies in his arms and walked out of the house. He\u2019d walked for a good five minutes gripping the squirming bunny to his chest till his heart had calmed down enough, then opened his phone and chanced a glance at his comments.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thing is, Lan Zhan had done a lot of things in his life so far that he wasn\u2019t proud of.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You could take your pick. From kissing Wei Ying in a dark room during a party game to Baidu searching descriptive phrases to identify the stickers in his bedroom to buying a denim jacket because Wei Ying thought a movie star looked cool in it. Each more mortifying than the last.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, a strong contender for first place would have to be the new email account he\u2019d made after the death of Wei Ying\u2019s first pet. They were eleven years old, and it was a rat Wei Ying had found in their schoolyard. He wouldn\u2019t come out of his room for days, Jiang Yanli was stressed and even Jiang Cheng was concerned, which was most unsettling of all.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"eb9b8e9f838e8a9d8e85848d8d8288828a87ab9a9ac5888486\">[email\u00a0protected]</a>: </strong> <em>Hello.

Please do not worry. Be well, Yiling Laozu.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>That night, Lan Zhan had casually brought up the name Yiling Laozu in conversation with Jiang Yanli over the phone. He\u2019d seen it in a sticker on Wei Ying\u2019s locker at swimming camp, he\u2019d said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s the name A-Ying used when he used to play with his rat. Said it was his fierce necromancer persona that would protect his rat from our mother, since she was not a fan. A-Ying is very into fantasy role-playing games these days, if you couldn\u2019t already tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walking around his neighbourhood years later with his comfort bunny in his arms, Lan Zhan had half-wished he\u2019d never learnt the name. He could have been blissfully unaware, not having to cope with the surreal, terrifying awareness that it was Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had commented on his video. <em>arms</em>, followed the eyeball emoji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, Lan Zhan could put it into perspective. He was addressing the enigmatic Hanguang-jun, to whom people proposed marriage daily after watching twenty minute videos of him cooking his everyday meals and playing with his bunnies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d paused that train of thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What had just come into his head was selfish, and awful and most certainly shameless. Perhaps more shameless than something even Wei Ying would do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But what if... no one had to know?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like he\u2019d done with the rest of his viewers, Lan Zhan must have tricked Wei Ying into thinking he\u2019s a handsome, suave man with his life together. Hanguang-jun would certainly not talk like a caveman in front of his crush or have a miniature crisis while attempting to wake him up in his bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still. If he replied as Hanguang-jun, just once - just to pretend, would it really be so wrong?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he could talk himself out of it, he\u2019d opened yilinglaozu\u2019s private message page, and sent:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hanguang-Jun: </strong> <em>What are you looking at?</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Minutes later, his phone had dinged with a reply.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em>\u00a0</em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu<em>:</em></strong> <em> Your bunnies, of course. Have you seen how ripped they are? What have you been feeding them? I wonder if they work out.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the year since then, yilinglaozu has left several comments on his videos. Lan Zhan has replied privately to all of them. Of course, he can pretend all he likes that it\u2019s his hands that Wei Ying finds pretty, or his day he\u2019s been tuning in to see for twenty minutes each week, or his smoothly worded messages he\u2019s sending flirtatious replies to, but the reality is this:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll never be that effortlessly cool actor in the denim jacket, making Wei Ying gasp in awe. He\u2019ll never even be charming, confident Hanguang-jun as hard as he pretends, not really.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yet, because this is his life, Lan Zhan has somehow been catfishing the love of his life into being enamoured with his own nameless, faceless social media persona.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His brother walks into their kitchen at around seven thirty, just home from the library.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks around from the counter. At the same time, Lan Huan spots the camera pointed at Lan Zhan\u2019s hands as he chops the vegetables.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWent to M50 art district,\u201d Lan Zhan replies. \u201cWith Yanli-jie. They always have something new there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, did you go there directly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks down at the vegetables. He knows where his brother is going with this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I took her from her flat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Huan\u2019s smile widens. \u201cDid you meet anyone there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales. Then he turns to give his brother a look. \u201cI do not understand how that is relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on now, can\u2019t I hope for the possibility of my little brother expanding his social circle? You\u2019ve been friends with Yanli for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to make friends with Jiang Cheng?\u201d he says, his nose wrinkling very slightly in distaste.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Yanli has two brothers, does she not?\u201d says Lan Huan, tapping his chin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had walked right into that one. He looks down at his work, his knife striking the chopping board a little harder than the spring onions deserved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a long moment he quietly says, \u201cWei Ying and I cannot be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mere suggestion is laughable. Wei Ying deserves friends who could laugh easily as him, fill the room with their presence and smile as bright as the sun. Everything Lan Zhan isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Huan\u2019s smile softens. \u201cYou cannot be anything with him if you don\u2019t make the least bit of effort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t answer, moving on to pour his feelings onto the garlic instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, I must correct myself,\u201d continues Lan Huan. \u201cYou have made the effort. I\u2019m sure our neighbours have heard enough of your efforts, from your balcony at five fifteen in the morning. But will Wei Ying ever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tosses the garlic into the hot oil, followed by the vegetables. They sizzle angrily as if in response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Huan sighs, and watches his brother stir-fry with a vengeance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After dinner, Lan Zhan goes to his room and sits at his desk. He goes over the footage from the day critically, slicing away parts that weren\u2019t right. He watches his and Jiang Yanli\u2019s hands chopping vegetables for lunch, the view from the train which they\u2019d taken to M50 district, then him cooking his dinner of steamed vegetables and rice. He mutes the audio on it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, after his brother had left the kitchen, he\u2019d brought his two bunnies on camera, making them sniff at the prepared food. He watches the footage of them squirming around excitedly in his arms at the sight and smell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>My dinner has their stamp of approval</em>, he types in the subtitles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s done, he gets into his bed. He reaches over for his backpack to and pulls out the diary he\u2019s been thinking about all day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Straightening up, he starts to go through the diary again from the very beginning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d been fairly regular with it for all of middle school and Lan Zhan\u2019s first year of high school, after which Jiang Yanli had moved on to university. Jiang Yanli had always been better at it, of course.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan spends long moments looking at the pasted ticket stubs, polaroid photos and receipts from their favourite cafes with their usual order. A green tea for him and an iced latte for her. Only Jiang Yanli could have known at the age of twelve that looking on things like that later would make them smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few pages in, Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers freeze over a photograph. It\u2019s of himself, Jiang Yanli and her two brothers at swimming camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s ten years old in the picture, and Jiang Yanli is twelve. Lan Zhan had been going to the swimming camp for two years now, and it was here that he\u2019d met Jiang Yanli.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was also where he\u2019d met Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan in the picture has his brows furrowed, eyes directed away from the source of his irritation. There is a beaming Jiang Yanli and an exasperated Jiang Cheng between them, but Wei Ying is craning his neck to the side to say something to Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Elbows on his knees, Lan Zhan leans over to stare at the journal placed on his crossed legs as thirteen year old memories begin to play in his head in vivid colour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Zhan had turned eight, his uncle had enrolled him for a summer swimming camp. He\u2019d been given the option of horse-riding or swimming, the two sports the Lan family traditionally took part in. His brother was a keen horse-rider but Lan Zhan had ended up choosing swimming: a more valuable life skill to learn, with much less sweating involved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been doing his laps at the shallow end of the pool, when a skinny boy with hair sticking out from under a red cap had swum up to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, do you wanna go to the deeper side?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had whipped around in shock. The deeper side was off limits till you\u2019d crossed into the advanced level. You weren\u2019t even allowed to compete for advanced level till you turned ten years old. Lan Zhan was eight, and this boy looked even younger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is off limits,\u201d he\u2019d answered stiffly. \u201cYour cap isn\u2019t even on properly,\u201d he\u2019d added, to emphasise how far-fetched his statement was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy had stuck out his bottom lip. Then he\u2019d reached out and tugged Lan Zhan\u2019s white cap right off. \u201cYours isn\u2019t either!\u201d he\u2019d said, his laughter ringing in Lan Zhan\u2019s ears as he turned around and shot through the water directly towards the deep end.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had bristled, something about the boy\u2019s laughter and his messy hair and his loud, annoying voice making his skin prickle. He\u2019d scissored through the water in pursuit, his swimming cap forgotten where the boy had tossed it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan was one of the best in their age group, taller and stronger than most of his peers. But this boy was swifter. He\u2019d slow down every so often, turn back with a grin and speed away just when Lan Zhan had almost caught up to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dimly, Lan Zhan had been aware he was breaking rules. Several, in fact. But this stupid boy\u2019s laughter and his loud, annoying voice had fast drowned out every other thought in his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019d caught up finally, the boy had grinned sideways at him. Then he\u2019d stopped altogether, kicking his feet to say afloat.\u00a0 \u201cHi, I\u2019m Wei Ying,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he\u2019d said, coming to a stop as well. They\u2019d reached the middle of the pool. It had been quiet and peaceful somehow, like they were the only two people in the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It hadn\u2019t felt as unpleasant as it should have.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI go to Yunmeng Primary,\u201d Wei Ying had said. \u201cYou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGusu Academy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy had made a face at that. \u201cOh, that\u2019s why you know all the rules by heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had found himself reaching out for the boy\u2019s hair. How irresponsible of him, he\u2019d thought. He\u2019d tucked the hair under the boy\u2019s cap. Then he\u2019d caught his eye, and quickly pulled his hand away and turned his face to the side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A while later, the boy had said with a cheeky grin, \u201cGuess you don\u2019t mind breaking rules as much you want people to think, huh, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had turned around in surprise, finding in the process a small crowd gathered at the opposite end of the pool. They\u2019d looked worried, waving and calling out to them to come back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had flushed, immediately disappearing underwater and cutting through the water to speed to the end. He hadn\u2019t realised till he\u2019d reached the end that his heart had been racing with excitement the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thirteen years later, Lan Zhan flips the pages of his memory journal with Jiang Yanli.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the beginning, Lan Zhan had been too embarrassed to use the journal at all. Luckily, Jiang Yanli had taken over for him. She always did have a head for things like this, and she\u2019d pasted items most would never even have dreamt of preserving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan must be a little bit sentimental too, because a pair of ice-cream sticks tacked onto a page fills his head with more memories from that first day at swimming camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHello, I\u2019m A-Ying\u2019s big sister!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She\u2019d come over to talk to him after the incident with Wei Ying at the pool. He\u2019d been mortified at having broken rules and furious with Wei Ying, and she\u2019d offered him ice cream in apology. It had taken a lot of coaxing and cajoling, but she was patient and his stomach had been starting to growl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t laughed when he\u2019d told her he\u2019d prefer vanilla over the rest of the array of flavours available.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d started talking after that, and every day for the rest of that month at swimming camp. It was mostly initiated by Jiang Yanli, but Lan Zhan had somehow found it easier to answer her than anyone he\u2019d ever met. The exact opposite of her foster brother, who unsettled Lan Zhan like no one else ever had.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They learnt that they both read Wei Menghua\u2019s series, took qin lessons and lived close by as well, even if they went to different schools. Yunmeng Primary was a lot more lax with rules than Gusu Academy, but unlike her obnoxious brothers, Jiang Yanli was gentle and well-behaved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d started running into each other at their favourite libraries and book stores after that. Then they\u2019d start to plan these run-ins. Lan Zhan had taken a while to get over his embarrassment, but he did eventually begin to add a few things of his own to their journal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he was eleven years old, his uncle had given him his first camera. It was a big deal to be given such a meaningful gift by the stern, perfectionist Lan Qiren.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to prove anything to him,\u201d his brother had told him gently. \u201cUncle sees something in you, but in his own way he really just wants what\u2019s best for you. Just remember to have fun, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had started with photography. He\u2019d taken to the art of composition, the power of telling a story with a scene, and the impact you could create with something as subtle as a play on colour or lighting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Quickly, he\u2019d discovered that he was very, very good at it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sitting on his bed all these years later, Lan Zhan leafs through the printouts of his shots he\u2019d pasted onto the journal. First photographs, then stills from the short sequences he\u2019d start to film. Turning the pages feels like watching the textbooks he\u2019d read in his spare time come to life. With every chapter he\u2019d cover, his shots would get a little more refined.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then a few weeks after his twelfth birthday, he\u2019d abruptly stopped adding anything to the journal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Jiang Yanli had persisted. Page after page, she\u2019d continued to paste small notes with cheerful messages and lines from her favourite poems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan thinks of her helplessly pouring her feelings into the journal, because she didn\u2019t know what else to do for her best friend. His heart swells till it feels too large for his chest to contain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, one month after he\u2019d stopped, Lan Zhan had starting adding to the journal again. He\u2019d marked his reappearance with a scrap of paper with his bunnies\u2019 paw prints imprinted on them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twelve year old Lan Zhan had followed his brother out of his room in no small amount of confusion. Lan Huan had been very mysterious when he\u2019d come to inform Lan Zhan there was someone here for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ever since his mother\u2019s death a month ago, even Jiang Yanli had been cautious about approaching him. She wouldn\u2019t call on him without messaging him beforehand. No one else ever called on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yet, right in the middle of the drawing room had been Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying, with two excitable bunnies in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI found A-Ying outside, trying to squeeze the bunnies in through the flap. He brought them for you but didn\u2019t want to meet you at all\u2014is that right?\u201d Wei Ying had looked to the side, lips pursed in a pout and a light flush over his cheekbones. \u201cWell, I thought you both should talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a blinding smile, Lan Huan had walked back into his own room. Left in silence, the two boys had faced each other in the middle of the drawing room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Ying had muttered. He never had been able to stay quiet for long. He\u2019d walked up to Lan Zhan and deposited the bunnies in his arms. \u201cI know you don\u2019t exactly wanna see me right now. But I found these bunnies in the woods behind our house and Auntie Yu didn\u2019t let me keep them, so I was wondering if you, uh, wanted them and\u2014wait, are you... Lan Zhan, is that a <em>smile</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bunnies were adorable. They\u2019d nuzzled at his fingers and blinked beadily up at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Lan Zhan had asked stiffly, turning around towards his room as he\u2019d tried his hardest to straighten his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah, I mean - A-Jie brought me a bit of last night\u2019s noodles? I was late for breakfast so Auntie, uh, didn\u2019t let me - Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Lan Zhan had gritted out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d sat side by side on Lan Zhan\u2019s balcony, eating congee with apple and beet salad as the bunnies nibbled at the steamed bok choy Lan Zhan had offered them. Wei Ying had kept talking about this and that all afternoon till their shadows grew longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His chatter was loud and incessant, and would perhaps have given anyone else a headache. Curiously enough, it was midway through this that the cacophony in Lan Zhan\u2019s head had started to quiet down for the first time that month.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan falls asleep with the journal under his arm, and wakes at three thirty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a quick shower, he dresses himself and places a towel and swim trunks in his backpack. He reaches the campus swimming pool just before four. There isn\u2019t a soul in sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Zhan lowers himself into the water, his first thought is that he should really be doing this more often. The water laps gently around him as he wades into a lane in the centre. It\u2019s calming, and the gentle, almost unconscious effort he has to take to keep himself afloat is tethering. Slowly, the knot in his stomach he\u2019d felt ever since he awoke starts to unravel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he settles into his laps, he grows aware of his times. He never actually times himself, but a point of reference is always satisfying. And his always been Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thought of him has him accelerating in the water, a familiar rush of blood coursing through his veins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he\u2019s towelling his hair dry later, he thinks maybe this wasn\u2019t so bad. Yes, he\u2019d definitely only come here this early hoping to run into Wei Ying. Yes, he\u2019s crushed at not running into Wei Ying despite all the effort. No, it isn\u2019t the proudest moment in his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t deny that it had felt good, once he manages to get past the abject mortification.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It becomes something of a routine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always enjoyed swimming, even if it had been hard to shed the clinical mindset towards it that had been driven into him since he was a child. To the Lans, swimming was about winning. Just another item to cross off the list of achievements they were expected to have under their belt. But what Lan Zhan has always loved is this - the calm that the water brings, the steady thrum of his racing heart even from the thought of a boy in a red swimming cap in the lane next to his.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some days, he\u2019ll see other students from the swim team. He knows they stare at him as he swims, the questions obvious on the tips of their tongues. <em>Why the hell aren\u2019t you on the team? </em>But he has enough of a reputation around campus that they know not to ask him directly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It goes pretty well for around a week. Then one day, Jiang Cheng shows up just as he\u2019s emerging from the pool.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan glances up at the source of the voice. He straightens up on the wet tiles and turns towards the changing room, ignoring him entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands of his retreating back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales. He\u2019d really been hoping to avoid this. He continues to walk, hoping Jiang Cheng will tire himself out eventually.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of nerve showing up just like this when my brother has been whining about wanting to race you again for ages,\u201d Jiang Cheng says loudly. Lan Zhan freezes mid-step.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying? Did he hear that right? Wei Ying wanted to race him again?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns around. \u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng gives him an almost sadistically satisfied grin, ignoring him in turn as he dives into the pool.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In all fairness, Lan Zhan probably deserved that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spends the rest of the day replaying Jiang Cheng\u2019s words in his head.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>My brother has been whining about wanting to race you for ages.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last time they\u2019d properly raced each other was six years ago. Lan Zhan wouldn\u2019t say he missed racing, but he missed racing Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll miss anything with Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he gets home and into his bed, he opens his phone to the vlog he\u2019d posted last night and finds the comment he\u2019s been hoping to see all day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu: </strong> <em>Could watch you playing with your bunnies all day &lt;3</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan fights down the painful clench of his heart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Hanguang-jun. Wei Ying thinks he\u2019s talking to Hanguang-jun. Wei Ying is sending hearts to Hanguang-jun. Mysterious, suave, charming Hanguang-jun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking a deep inhale, he opens his private messages thread with <em>yilinglaozu</em> and types out his response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hanguang-jun:</strong> <em>Is the heart for my bunnies, or me?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu: </strong> <em>aiyo hanguang-jun... you cant play with my heart like that... you must be a heartbreaker irl </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hanguang-jun: </strong> <em>I am not playing.

He really is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he knows there isn\u2019t a chance Wei Ying could know that the channel he\u2019s been commenting on is really Lan Zhan\u2019s. It\u2019s ridiculous to even think of him leaving comments like that if he did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The person Wei Ying wishes he could watch all day is Hanguang-jun. Faceless, mysterious Hanguang-jun with his perfect, aesthetically pleasing life. Suave Hanguang-jun, who doesn\u2019t talk like a caveman or dress like he\u2019s heading to a funeral.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of all the dreams he had of the future as child, he\u2019s pretty sure being jealous over his own social media persona at the age of twenty-one wasn\u2019t one of them. But he\u2019s realised long ago that things often turn out the way you least expect them to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, he\u2019s midway through a lap when he senses someone approaching him from the lane next to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Someone swift as an arrow, slicing effortlessly through the water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan picks up his pace without even realising it, his heartbeat ringing in his ears. Of course it\u2019s him. He\u2019d know his presence in the water next to him even if he forgot his own name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They swim side by side, as perfectly matched as ever. Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s swum quite as fast ever before and he can tell from the force of the splashes in the neighbouring lane that Wei Ying is stretching himself too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they reach the other end at exactly the same moment, he\u2019s gasping for breath. He glances to the side, and finds Wei Ying grinning at him, face flushed from the race.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says breathlessly, and it\u2019s all Lan Zhan can do to stop himself from lunging at him, slamming him against the wall and kissing his beautiful, beautiful face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns around immediately without a word and launches himself back down the pool. A split second later, Wei Ying follows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s felt this alive in a while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll come tomorrow around eight in the evening,\u201d says Wei Ying, as they towel themselves dry. \u201cEarly mornings just doesn\u2019t agree with someone like me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou came here with Jiang Cheng this time last week,\u201d Lan Zhan can\u2019t help saying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh - that was only because he was being an asshole,\u201d Wei Ying says, matter-of-factly. \u201cHmm, can\u2019t believe I woke up this early twice in two weeks. Must be some kind of record.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy today?\u201d Lan Zhan asks, before he can stop himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying colours at that, for some reason. \u201cAh! Well, it\u2019s just that Jiang Cheng said - I mean, I couldn\u2019t sleep, so...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, Lan Zhan gets into bed after dinner and takes the journal out from his drawer again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pasted scraps of memories with Jiang Yanli begin to change the further Lan Zhan goes. Their weekend dates involve rarer teas at more niche, obscure tea houses now, with tickets to live classical music performances and art galleries, and photos of them trying out clothes at their favourite boutiques.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some time later, Lan Zhan comes across a photo of fifteen year old Wei Ying that he\u2019d taken after one of their races at the swim camp. He\u2019d debated if he should add it here, but he\u2019d figured it was okay if he did just once. After all, in recent years he\u2019d been seen with his camera so often around the camp that it\u2019d be more suspicious if he didn\u2019t include at least something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Especially since most of his footage had just been of Wei Ying and his different moods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, take a picture when I\u2019m actually posing for once?\u201d Wei Ying had whined. \u201cYou take candids all the time and you never let me look at them and I\u2019m sure I look like shit\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do not,\u201d Lan Zhan had replied immediately. If anything, he was more beautiful like that, unselfconscious and free.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d held his camera at the ready, waiting for Wei Ying to pose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After taking a few shots<em>,</em> he\u2019d looked down at the photos again. He\u2019d lingered too long on Wei Ying\u2019s face, and in that time Wei Ying had bounded over next to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had placed his head on his shoulder - his <em>shoulder</em> - and peered at the viewfinder with Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGot you,\u201d he\u2019d said with a grin, and pressed on the back button to go through his gallery.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s heart had been in his throat, both from Wei Ying being so close to him and from the fact that he was looking at his gallery.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the four years since his uncle had gifted him his first camera, Lan Zhan had realised quickly that filming was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. He\u2019d studied textbooks, done online tutorials and even plucked up enough courage to seek help from his uncle. With Wei Ying looking at his work, Lan Zhan had felt like his soul was just laid bare for him to see.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so... Lan Zhan, wow. You\u2019re so talented.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s heart had begun to race, a warm feeling spreading all the way to his toes at the look of admiration on Wei Ying\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m almost jealous,\u201d Wei Ying had said with a sudden laugh. \u201cMy whole life is swimming, and I thought it was yours too but now I feel like there\u2019s this whole other life you have\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSwimming is my life, too,\u201d Lan Zhan had answered quickly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Swimming with Wei Ying, that is. Lan Zhan\u2019s uncle had started to inquire about his times at the dinner table lately. Applications for high school swimming teams would be opening soon. The forms had been sitting on Lan Zhan\u2019s desk for weeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had looked up at him in surprise. Then his face had relaxed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty cool, isn\u2019t it? You know, Lan Zhan, I always used to wonder what it\u2019d be like if you went pro too, winning Olympics gold for China with me. But you\u2019re really good at filming, and I don\u2019t know - I feel like it really makes you happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t known how to respond. It was probably the first conversation they\u2019d had in the years they\u2019d known each other that didn\u2019t consist of Wei Ying teasing him in some way. Wei Ying was being insightful, telling him things about himself that he\u2019d hardly even realised, and it had made his head spin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo make sure to take good footage of me! You\u2019ll be auctioning them for millions when I win gold at the Olympics!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d sprung away with a laugh, diving back into the pool. Lan Zhan had sighed, as the world turned upright again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shows up at the pool the next day, at eight in the evening like he\u2019d mentioned. Lan Zhan is already there, for no particular reason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The day after, he shows up as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the next.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the next.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t stop showing up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll usually arrive a few minutes after Lan Zhan has started. They\u2019ll race non-stop for forty five minutes, after which Wei Ying will follow him to the changing room, talking a mile a minute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, when did you start coming here?\u201d he asks one day, after a few particularly furious laps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA few days ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh - you don\u2019t look totally out of practice, though. Have you been swimming somewhere else all this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan glances at him. He\u2019s towelling his hair dry, carefully avoiding Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Lanling Hotel pool, sometimes,\u201d Lan Zhan says. Generations of friendly business relations between his family and the Jins had made them all lifetime members of their exclusive chain of sporting clubs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t far from his flat so he\u2019d end up going occasionally, for exercise and a change of pace. But it\u2019s nothing like swimming right here, with Wei Ying next to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks at him, waiting to catch his eye. Wei Ying closes the door of his locker and steps to the side, and his eyes meet Lan Zhan\u2019s. There\u2019s a hollow look in his eyes, all of a sudden.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was... boring,\u201d Lan Zhan says stiffly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales, still looking at him. <em>Because you weren\u2019t there</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever he sees on Lan Zhan\u2019s face makes Wei Ying look away, his face bright red for some reason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, whatever the reason - I hope you\u2019re ready to remember just badly I used to kick your ass!\u201d Wei Ying says, his voice too loud in the small changing room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is not how I recall it,\u201d says Lan Zhan, raising his brow as he closes his own locker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine - so you kicked my ass the remaining half of the time,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cAnd Lan Zhan, I... I missed it,\u201d he adds, much more quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan freezes in place. His heart races so fast it couldn\u2019t possibly be healthy. After a long moment, he says, \u201cI missed it too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he walks into the changing cubicle before he can say any of the other things that are bubbling up to his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Friday, Lan Zhan brings his camera to the pool. He films the still waters for a few moments.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afterwards, he sits side by side with Wei Ying on the bench in the changing room as they towel dry their hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour bag looks pretty well packed today, are you planning to go directly to class?\u201d Wei Ying laughs lightly. \u201cReaching the lecture hall at five in the morning is kinda a lot, even for you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan slows the motions of the towel on his hair. \u201cI brought some filming equipment,\u201d he says shortly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cWhat - What did you film today?\u201d he says. His cheeks are pink. They\u2019re always pink after they swim. It makes Lan Zhan\u2019s chest swell just a little bit, knowing that racing him made that happen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It also makes Lan Zhan want to touch his cheeks, to see if they\u2019re as warm as they are pink. To kiss him, undress him again right here, lick his whole body till he\u2019s mindless with pleasure and his skin is this particular shade of pink right down to his toes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome shots of the pool,\u201d he says instead, and pulls the towel lower to rub circles all over his burning face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying hums in response. \u201cAre you enjoying this term?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan replies. \u201cWe have a new visual storytelling class. It is interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It hits him just then that this is really happening. He\u2019s having a conversation with Wei Ying. Wei Ying isn\u2019t teasing him, or trying to rile him up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d he asks, not wanting this to end just yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s not bad...\u201d Wei Ying shrugs. \u201cI mean - it\u2019s chemistry, you know? It\u2019s cool. Um, not sure what else to say about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan watches him. Wei Ying is still smiling, but it doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you ever compete again?\u201d Lan Zhan asks, unable to help himself. Perhaps he isn\u2019t allowed to ask something so personal, but he needs to know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying starts. For a moment, he stares at his hands with a faraway look in his eyes. Then he says, \u201cAh, I\u2019m too old for that now, aren\u2019t I? Had such childish dreams when I was younger, god I was embarrassing\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying can still apply,\u201d says Lan Zhan quickly. \u201cThe swim team tryouts\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Wei Ying cuts in loudly, grinning wider, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about <em>you</em> and why you\u2019re suddenly being so regular with swimming? Wanna get back in shape? Lan Zhan, didn\u2019t you know you\u2019re in perfect shape already? You should tell me who the girl you wanna impress is, I\u2019ll introduce you, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll say no - ah, why are you looking me like\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gives him a withering glance before getting to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look happy, though,\u201d says Wei Ying. Lan Zhan turns just enough to see him smiling. This time, he\u2019s brimming with it, right up to his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The truth is, swimming always had made Lan Zhan happy. Stripped of everything else, he\u2019d always found the water calming, the rush of a race invigorating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Perhaps only with Wei Ying, but still.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like swimming,\u201d he\u2019d told Wei Ying once, when they were fifteen years old and days away from applying to high school swimming teams. \u201cHaving to swim... I do not like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had stared at him for several moments, the swing of his feet in the water coming to a halt. His eyes had softened. He\u2019s looked proud, for some reason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I kinda get that?\u201d he\u2019d said. He\u2019d smiled gently, looking at the still waters of the pool in front of them. \u201cCan\u2019t lie, I\u2019ll really miss competing with you, ha...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan still race you,\u201d Lan Zhan had said at once. He\u2019d like to race Wei Ying. He thinks there\u2019s nothing he wouldn\u2019t want, as long as it was with Wei Ying. \u201cIf - If you ever want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes had widened at that. He\u2019d torn his gaze away to look at his feet, the back of his neck pink. \u201cThat... That\u2019d be cool. I mean, I don\u2019t think I would have improved this much\u2014I mean, the whole reason I already have times that\u2019ll qualify me for a uni team us because I had to keep up with you, so... But I also don\u2019t think you should ever feel like it\u2019s something you have to do because you\u2019re expected to, you know? Especially if it\u2019s something that makes you happy just the way it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A week later, Lan Zhan had faced his uncle in his office and told him he wouldn\u2019t be competing in swimming tournaments anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been six years since then, and Lan Zhan has never looked back. After lingering a few moments in the changing room to watch Wei Ying tie his hair up in his usual high ponytail, he turns to the door again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, Wei Ying,\u201d he says quietly before he steps outside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s half past eight when Lan Zhan reaches home. He\u2019ll start feeling sleepy by nine, and he needs to put his vlog up tonight. For the first time in his life, he opens up his laptop on the dinner table to edit his video while he eats dinner.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has a schedule to stick to, even though he\u2019s not sure he knows what that means anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s almost finished, he glances over the top of his laptop and finds his brother eyeing him with a smile. Lan Zhan has always made it a point to never do anything else during a meal, deeming it disrespectful to both the meal and everyone else at the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says shortly. \u201cReturned late. Have to post tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His brother nods, his smile widening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSwam at the campus pool again?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Zhan answers tightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAny reason for the sudden change? You know you can just tell Jin Zixuan if there\u2019s anything about the Lanling pool that\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Lan Zhan grits out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, sure. The university pool must have a very different crowd from Lanling, especially this near closing time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am going to my room now,\u201d Lan Zhan informs his brother. He drives a last, too-large spoonful of rice into his mouth before getting to his feet with his plate and laptop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s back in his room, he sits at his desk to lay the final finishing touches to his video and hits <em>post</em>. He crosses over to his bed, settles in and reaches for the journal on his nightstand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost nine again, so he doesn\u2019t have a lot of time. He\u2019s been getting through the pages slowly but surely since he\u2019s been returning so late these days, and perhaps it\u2019s for the best. As the years pass, the entries become few and far between, each making Lan Zhan lie back in bed lost in his thoughts for several moments.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s aware he\u2019s acting like a lovesick romance novel protagonist. It\u2019s mortifying, but it\u2019s also an inevitable side-effect of replaying your teenage years when you\u2019d spent most of it being in love with Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The simplest way out is probably to just power through.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first page Lan Zhan opens today has a photo pasted on it. It\u2019s from the last tournament they\u2019d ever played at that summer camp, weeks before they started high school.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After graduating from summer camp, most kids ended up competing for a spot on their high school swimming teams. Most had no choice, with parents desperate for something to brag about at dinner parties. Lan Zhan\u2019s uncle hadn\u2019t been pleased with his decision to quit competitive swimming, but he would live with it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For some - like Wei Ying - high school swim teams would lead to university teams, which were hopefully a stepping stone to being scouted by professional teams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first summer after Jiang Yanli graduated, she\u2019d given Lan Zhan a talk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan, I know you don\u2019t get along really well with my brothers, but you\u2019ll keep an eye out for them, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had considered it. He\u2019d always had a possibly irrational distaste for Jiang Cheng, which may or may not have multiplied exponentially every time Wei Ying slung an arm around his shoulder. As for Wei Ying himself, well\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had come to realise a long time ago that the pounding of his heart when he raced Wei Ying in the pool wasn\u2019t simply because of the exertion. Wei Ying wasn\u2019t like anyone he\u2019d ever met. His sister was gentle, shared his interests and understood him. She was the best friend he could have ever asked for, and possibly didn\u2019t deserve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Wei Ying made his blood race, had been talking about winning the Olympics at the age of eight, tried to smuggle in pet bunnies to cheer him up after his mother died, and was clever and brilliant and bright and <em>perfect</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d he\u2019d grunted in agreement in response to Jiang Yanli\u2019s question. If he\u2019d been picturing himself swooping Wei Ying to safety in his arms from some imaginary horror just happening to strike at a children\u2019s swimming camp - well, she didn\u2019t have to know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan focuses his attention back to the photograph in the journal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fifteen year old Lan Zhan stands at second position, with Jiang Cheng in third place. Jiang Cheng looks down at his feet. Wei Ying is in first place, looking at his brother with his forehead creased in worry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Back then, nearly every tournament would end with Lan Zhan and Wei Ying vying for first and second. Lan Zhan usually ended up first for backstroke, and Wei Ying for freestyle. So it hadn\u2019t been the first time Jiang Cheng had come third.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been the first time his parents had come to watch, though.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had watched the Jiang parents glare at their younger son from the crowd. Jiang Cheng had cowered, and Wei Ying had climbed off his place on the podium to stand next to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had only angered them more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan remembers Jiang Cheng being dragged off by his mother in a vice-like grip the moment the photo session was over. They hadn\u2019t even spared a glance back at Wei Ying. Wei Ying had glanced around uncertainly before following them to the car. Suddenly, he\u2019d looked very, very small.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few days later, Lan Zhan had got a call from a tearful Jiang Yanli. \u201cA-Zhan,\u201d she\u2019d sobbed, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do... Mother and father won\u2019t stop yelling at Jiang Cheng for not doing better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis times are good, though,\u201d Lan Zhan had told her. \u201cThey are still enough to let him easily qualify for any of the high school teams.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but they just wouldn\u2019t listen, and kept comparing him to - god, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but the deadline just passed and we found out A-Ying withdrew his applications for the high school teams. He says he\u2019s never going to swim again at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan couldn\u2019t remember feeling as helpless as he had in that moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next morning, Lan Zhan reaches for his phone before he heads for the bathroom and opens the video he\u2019d posted last night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>shineefucker420</strong>: <em>you guys are a bunch of mosquitoes, thirsting over veins like that </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu</strong>: <em>not his blood i\u2019m trying to drink tho</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>xxxLordOfDarknessxxx</strong>: <em>Excuse you, we are vampires, not mosquitoes!</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan opens his message thread with yilinglaozu.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hanguang-Jun: </strong> <em>What do you wish to drink? You mentioned that it\u2019s not my blood you wish to drink. Is there a particular recipe you want me to try?</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>He gets up after that, brushes his teeth, exercises, showers and practises his qin with his head full of the conversation he\u2019d just had despite his best efforts to concentrate. The moment it strikes seven, he heads to his desk where he\u2019d left his phone. He opens the message thread again.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu:</strong> <em>what</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu:</strong> <em>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu:</strong> <em>omg you\u2019re too pure i swear i\u2019m in tears</em></p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hanguang-jun:</strong> <em>Why are you in tears? Did I say something wrong?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu:</strong> <em>NO... no omg you\u2019re fine... you\u2019re perfect </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu:</strong> <em>also uh... sure i want you to do a drink next time</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu:</strong> <em>would you mix me up a cocktail or two?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hanguang-jun: </strong> <em>Shameless...</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He places his phone on his bed. Then he turns on his side and presses his burning face into the pillow, the words <em>you\u2019re perfect</em> playing over and over in his head like a broken film reel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That evening, he heads to the pool after a session at the library.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Session</em> sounds good. <em>Session</em> is a catch-all term. <em>Session</em> does not necessarily imply he\u2019d been sitting in his corner in the library, researching mixology and ordering items from Taobao at breakneck speed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He arrives at the pool a few minutes before eight. It\u2019s empty. He takes his camera out and begins to film the water, walking slowly along the edge. He\u2019s looking intently at his viewfinder, so he\u2019s understandably flustered when someone pops his head into view.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying holds him around his waist to steady him, but it\u2019s too late. He crashes into the water, bringing Wei Ying down with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He breaks the surface, pulling his camera up with him. He can\u2019t see Wei Ying around him and the water looks quiet, so he goes under again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hovering just beneath the surface, Wei Ying smiles at him through the water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is eight years old again, and time has stopped in the middle of the pool with Wei Ying next to him. Almost without thinking, he points his camera and starts to film him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He watches Wei Ying smile wider through the viewfinder, then kick his heels and start to swim away from him. Lan Zhan follows, filming him all the while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is beautiful. He\u2019s beautiful when he wakes up, frowning and messy-haired. He\u2019s beautiful when he answers the door in his too-large shirt and tiny shorts. Lan Zhan can\u2019t think of a Wei Ying in any form, in any universe, that wouldn\u2019t be beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But like this - darting through the water like he was born to, smiling at him through the water that he loves so much, Lan Zhan thinks he may be most beautiful of all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he gasps as he breaks the surface, moments before Lan Zhan comes up next to him. \u201cSorry this is probably a bit late to ask, but - your camera is waterproof, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan opens his camera to the gallery and starts to play the footage. Wei Ying wades closer to him, and peers over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hey, that\u2019s me,\u201d he says sheepishly, as his grinning face comes into view before they\u2019d fallen into the water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next footage starts at him smiling in the water, still fully clothed. He looks like he\u2019s glowing softly in the light from the floodlights above the pool. He spins in the water gracefully, launching himself through the water. Lan Zhan glances around at Wei Ying, watching the viewfinder intently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twelve centimetres. Maybe twelve point five.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Studying film for so many years has helped him get pretty accurate at estimating distance. He\u2019s fairly certain that\u2019s the distance he\u2019d have to lean to kiss Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s also studied perspective distortion. So he knows that really, he could be about twelve million miles away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A week goes by before he knows it, each day flying by with the anticipation of seeing Wei Ying in the evening. When Friday comes around, he gets a message from Jiang Yanli after his morning lecture.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang Yanli (12:03): </strong> <em>A-Zhan, what\u2019s up? Feel like we haven\u2019t talked in ages. Are you free for tea?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan meets her at Heyuan Tea House. It\u2019s been one of their favourite haunts at university, close enough from campus that they could get back in time for post-lunch classes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re friends with Jin Zixuan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d says Jiang Yanli suddenly, some minutes into a conversation about the potted plants she\u2019d been considering for their flat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a friend,\u201d says Lan Zhan hurriedly. Because they\u2019re not. They\u2019re really not. \u201cFamily acquaintances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d says Jiang Yanli, knitting her brows. \u201cI seem to recall him being at all your birthday par\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly as a formality,\u201d says Lan Zhan. He rarely cuts in, but the concept of being friends with Jin Zixuan is too humiliating to even allow an extra moment floating around in the universe. \u201cI was also made to attend his birthdays.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli takes a sip of tea. \u201cWell, I\u2019m asking because I need his help on an assignment. Do you have his number?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c... Yes,\u201d Lan Zhan admits. He opens his phone to the contact page and hands it over to Jiang Yanli. He should probably be a bit more curious about what kind of assignment would necessitate his help since she\u2019s studying architecture, and he\u2019s in business. But Lan Zhan mostly just wants to go back to pretending he doesn\u2019t have Jin Zixuan\u2019s number on his phone, so he lets it slide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHeard you\u2019ve been swimming at the university pool lately,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, handing back his phone after she\u2019d keyed in his number.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho told you?\u201d says Lan Zhan. He answers a beat too quickly, suddenly wondering if it was possible Wei Ying ever spoke about him to her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Cheng, of course,\u201d she says. Her voice is light and teasing. \u201cWhy, is there anyone else I know you\u2019ve been swimming with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan keeps walking into these traps. Were all older siblings trained somewhere for this?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying comes there sometimes,\u201d he answers briefly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA whole week went by, and I didn\u2019t even get my usual message about filming help. Have you been getting enough footage elsewhere, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s ears go warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had asked him to film them swimming the day after they\u2019d fallen into the pool together. So Lan Zhan had chosen three spots around the pool to place his cameras for the best possible angles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like I should have worn new trunks for this,\u201d Wei Ying had said, looking around at the elaborate setup with wide eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Wei Ying had asked, and he\u2019d get nothing but the best.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So the days had passed, and by the end of the week Lan Zhan had collected enough footage to make a whole mini-series. The two of them racing, Wei Ying flipping his head up as he hit the finish line, Wei Ying turning to smile at him, Wei Ying laughing, Wei Ying stopping midway through a race to tackle Lan Zhan in the middle of the pool, Wei Ying starting a water fight with him\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust some here and there,\u201d Lan Zhan tells Jiang Yanli, before taking a long sip of his tea to bury his face behind the cup for a bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Monday, Lan Zhan is just leaving his last lecture for the day when someone barrels into him in the corridor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks down in horror as Wei Ying grasps his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time and space shrink to the singular act of Wei Ying taking his hand in his own. His <em>hand. Wei Ying\u2019s </em>hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sudden momentum has him tipping forward, and with Wei Ying whirling around to pull him in the opposite direction, he gets a face full of his short, messy ponytail. Lan Zhan inhales, time and space expanding a little to make room for the smell of apples and cinnamon, some sweat, and oddly, sandalwood -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sneezes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying turns around. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Lan Zhan. He\u2019s still dizzy from the thought of Wei Ying smelling even slightly like himself. It\u2019s not the same products he uses, and he\u2019s afraid to sniff any more in case he actually <em>is</em> allergic. But it makes his heart clench painfully tight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I - uh, tried a new shampoo recently,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, looking ahead as he tugs Lan Zhan into an empty room. The nape of his neck is faintly pink again. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s not the point, damn it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns to face Lan Zhan, letting go of his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you tell my sister about that asshole Jin Zixuan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan frowns. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJin Zixuan!\u201d Wei Ying cries. \u201cImagine having to hear from my sister that she\u2019s going on a date with that posh, arrogant prick? And that <em>you</em> had something to do with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI - I merely gave her his number, since she needed it for a project. She asked me for it. Wei Ying, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many more friends do you have?\u201d Wei Ying bursts out. He goes instantly red, as if he\u2019s just realised what he\u2019s said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan searches his face. For one wild moment he\u2019d thought Wei Ying sounded <em>jealous</em>. But that couldn\u2019t be true. There\u2019s no way Wei Ying - bright, carefree, brilliant Wei Ying - would be jealous of who he\u2019s friends with\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI - I mean, you\u2019re lucky your friends with A-jie, or I\u2019d really start to doubt your taste in friends, hah...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There it was. He was right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJin Zixuan and I are not... friends,\u201d Lan Zhan says. He tries to ignore the way Wei Ying seems to perk up instantly. \u201cWe are... acquaintances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a rel\u2014 I mean, he\u2019s an asshole, and he definitely doesn\u2019t deserve A-jie! Lan Zhan, we need to put an end to this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYanli-jie is a grown adult,\u201d Lan Zhan reminds him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister! I\u2019ve got to protect her honour,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cAnd you - since you\u2019re responsible for them exchanging numbers, you\u2019re now morally obliged to help me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMorally obliged?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Wei Ying, with more conviction. \u201cYou created this mess. You\u2019re going to help me fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales. \u201cAnd just what is your great plan of action?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe give Jin Zixuan the talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe talk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Lan Zhan, the talk! You know how it goes. You, the intimidating best friend. Me, the scary brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks. \u201cScary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Wei Ying says. He puts his hands on his hips and frowns, cheeks filling with air. Lan Zhan wants to kiss him really, really badly. \u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Ying demands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying looks...\u201d He stops himself. He\u2019d almost called him cute. But he isn\u2019t allowed to, as much as he deludes himself into thinking that one day he\u2019d tell Wei Ying about how he feels. Wei Ying deserves to know he\u2019s loved, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that from him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying twists his lips into a pout, then frowns. He draws his brows together, clenching his jaw. He looks furious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very, very attractive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan swallows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying breaks the expression, and grins. It all happens so quickly it gives Lan Zhan whiplash. \u201cAh, I was good - wasn\u2019t I?\u201d he crows. \u201cI knew it! I intimidated you so well. Should have know that I\u2019d pull it off best if I just pictured that asshole Jin Zixuan being friends with y\u2014um, being friendly with A-jie. A-Anyway, it\u2019s your turn now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He beams at Lan Zhan, waiting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighs. He frowns at Wei Ying. It\u2019s hard to feel actually angry at him. He\u2019s been annoyed at him for the greater part of their lives, of course. But if he\u2019s being honest, he\u2019d really only been annoyed with himself for all the uncomfortable feelings Wei Ying made him feel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always easier to be angry at himself, so he thinks of Hanguang-jun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang-jun, with his stupid hands that Wei Ying likes, the stupid messages he sends that Wei Ying sends blatantly flirtatious replies to, the stupid things he does all day that Wei Ying says he\u2019ll never tire of watching.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All things that Wei Ying would be put off by if he ever figures out it had been Lan Zhan all along. Lan Zhan with his fuddy-duddy clothes, who has to Baidu search his favourite spiky-haired punk rock band members and looks ridiculous in a denim jacket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan relaxes. Belatedly, he realises he had worked himself into quite a mood. His heart is still thudding in his chest as he lets out a breath he wasn\u2019t aware he\u2019d been holding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is avoiding his gaze, face bright red for some reason. \u201cTh-That works, I guess,\u201d he says. He turns around towards the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Wei Ying turns. \u201cSorry. Uh, that was a bit - Anyway, shall we meet Jin Zixuan this weekend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turns outside the entrance to the cafe where he\u2019d been waiting. Wei Ying skids to a halt next to him. \u201cSorry, sorry, had you been waiting long? Forgot my subway card... again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twenty three minutes, to be precise. But most of that was his own fault, arriving too early in the anticipation of seeing Wei Ying again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying reaches over to touch his arm as they make to enter, momentarily freezing every thought in his brain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you have to be the one to open the conversation,\u201d says Wei Ying, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gives him a small frown. \u201cThis was your idea,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know, but Lan Zhan - you promised to help!\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cWe have to have the upper hand from the start. You know, take control of the conversation. It can\u2019t be me, because I\u2019ll have the fucker running back to his shitty yellow Ferrari in two seconds flat and fleeing the country in his stupid private jet. And then A-jie will never get an explanation, and she\u2019ll be sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a lot of faith in your powers of intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was good yesterday, admit it! I saw you. You know. Gulping. You were terrified!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not <em>gulp</em>,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cI do not gulp.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(In fright, that is. In the crushing awareness that angry Wei Ying is yet another one of his moods that he finds attractive? ... Possibly.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want a replay?\u201d Wei Ying says, cocking his head to the side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan balks, turning quickly to enter the cafe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMake sure to do your moody, disappointed thing!\u201d Wei Ying calls behind him as he follows. \u201cYou know, for a gentle buildup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They find Jin Zixuan already waiting at a table for them, and make their way over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Lan Zhan will eventually say something. At some point. After he gets over the fact that Wei Ying\u2019s thigh is flush against his own from how close they\u2019re sitting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan gives them an exasperated look, and breaks the deadlock. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He looks at Lan Zhan. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m too curious to know. Didn\u2019t take you for someone who\u2019d willingly hang out with <em>him</em>.\u201d He tilts his head towards Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan clenches his fists. Before he can answer, Wei Ying explodes next to him. \u201cWith <em>me</em>?\u201d he exclaims. \u201cHere I was wondering why my sister would willingly hang out with <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, too bad she already agreed to go out with me,\u201d says Jin Zixuan smugly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re lucky punching people is illegal. Lan Zhan, there must be a loophole - will you find a loophole for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d Lan Zhan places a hand on Wei Ying\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying turns to him in surprise, but he unclenches his fists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, I am not unwilling,\u201d he says. He looks at Wei Ying, hoping he\u2019ll be able to convey even a fraction of what he wants to say without putting it into words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan...?\u201d Wei Ying breathes. Lan Zhan is aware more than ever of just how close they\u2019re sitting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHanging out with Wei Ying,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cIt is - not unpleasant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, am I necessary here?\u201d says Jin Zixuan. He gets to his feet before Lan Zhan even realises he\u2019s said something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he looks up at him. \u201cApologise to Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan crosses his arms and looks patiently up at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really standing up for him?\u201d Jin Zixuan scoffs, as though he\u2019d been waiting for the punch line. It doesn\u2019t come, which shouldn\u2019t surprise him since it\u2019s Lan Zhan he\u2019d been expecting it from. \u201cIs it weed? Did you finally decide you\u2019re not above smoking a little weed sometimes? We tried so hard to get you to, at that party last year but - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou went to a party with him?\u201d says Wei Ying, whirling around to face him. \u201cYou go to parties with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust one time,\u201d Lan Zhan tells him quickly. He sounds like he\u2019s reassuring Wei Ying, which doesn\u2019t make sense to him at all. But something in the way Wei Ying is looking at him with his brows creased and his lips twisted into a pout makes him feel like he should. \u201cIt was my brother\u2019s friend\u2019s birthday, and our families are old acquaintances,\u201d he says, with a dismissive motion in Jin Zixuan\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Ying. He nods, and gives Lan Zhan a small smile. Colour blooms on his cheeks again. \u201cI, uh. I just thought\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan waits breathlessly for him to finish. He\u2019s probably being completely ridiculous, too deep into the illusion to know what\u2019s real anymore, but he needs to know why Wei Ying cares who he\u2019s friends with, which parties he goes to\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo reiterate,\u201d snaps Jin Zixuan from the other end of the table. \u201cIs my presence fucking necessary here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment breaks. A shadow of something seems to pass across Wei Ying\u2019s face. \u201cI was just wondering if A-jie was going to those parties too,\u201d he says. He\u2019s smiling, but it sounds hollow. He doesn\u2019t meet Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know, just watching out for my big sis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jin Zixuan says. He turns to leave, then pauses with a hand on his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll see your sister this weekend,\u201d he says gruffly to Wei Ying, like it\u2019s causing him physical pain. \u201cI\u2019ll take her to Shintori, will bring her home by eleven. And don\u2019t ever fucking insinuate again I\u2019ll treat her any less than she deserves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He walks away before Wei Ying can retort. Lan Zhan glances to the side to find Wei Ying looking distracted, like he hadn\u2019t even been trying to find a way to retort. It\u2019s not an opportunity he\u2019d normally miss.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sit in silence for a while. Wei Ying seems like he doesn\u2019t have much to say after Jin Zixuan\u2019s parting rejoinder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As much as it pains him to admit it, Lan Zhan can\u2019t find fault with his intentions either. He\u2019s tolerated Jin Zixuan over the years mostly for the sake of their families, but he\u2019s never actively liked the guy. But he has to admit that his little speech had almost, after all these years, made Lan Zhan feel like the guy might actually have a soul buried deep underneath his flashy cars and nauseatingly expensive cologne.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s true, though - Lan Zhan digs his nails into his palm. He\u2019s starting to get a sinking feeling that this operative may soon become redundant, and he isn\u2019t ready just yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJin Zixuan did not seem outwardly ill-intentioned,\u201d he begins. \u201cHowever\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying turns quickly to look at him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe always has been hard to read. Poker. He is quite good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d says Wei Ying. He nods vigorously. \u201cTold you. Knew there was something off about him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods solemnly. \u201cThe investigation cannot stop here,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight!\u201d says Wei Ying. He straightens up from the slump he\u2019d fallen into at some point. \u201cSo, we\u2019re on for the date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan picks a glass of water and tips it bottoms up into his mouth till he coughs, hoping it\u2019ll hide the way his face burns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan finds himself in front of his wardrobe again. He\u2019s spent so long trying to choose an outfit it\u2019s starting to feel like he\u2019s the one going on a date with Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except: if you were technical about it, he will be going to a romantic restaurant with Wei Ying. Wei Ying had insisted they\u2019d order enough food as well, to ensure they don\u2019t get kicked out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be paying, since you\u2019ve still got to make up for dragging everyone into this mess,\u201d Wei Ying had told him cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if Wei Ying had to ask.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tries to remember if Jiang Yanli had ever mentioned what Wei Ying\u2019s favourite desserts were. Either way, whatever Wei Ying would want, he\u2019d get. He\u2019d placed the emergency credit card he shares with his brother in his wallet too, just in case.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan finally settles on a white button up shirt and light blue jeans. He is decidedly not a jeans person, but it doesn\u2019t feel as ridiculous without the denim jacket. He\u2019s also a bit less of a scrawny teen than he was, so the way his legs fill out the jeans he right now isn\u2019t terribly unpleasant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he\u2019s watched one too many douyins about good outfit ideas for a first date, that\u2019s between him and his search history.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a reckless moment, he\u2019d offered to pick Wei Ying up from the Jiang\u2019s flat. It\u2019s definitely selfish of him. But it\u2019s probably the first and last time he\u2019s ever be able to live out the illusion of being on an actual date with Wei Ying. And it\u2019s all just in his head, so could it really be that wrong?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, Jiang Yanli is always worrying about how Wei Ying keeps forgetting his subway card. Maybe Lan Zhan is just saving the delay he\u2019d experience if he realises he\u2019d forgotten his card once he\u2019s already at the station. And, consequently, be late to begin their mission. Lan Zhan could be doing him a favour. All for the greater good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>... Probably?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He drives to the Jiang\u2019s building. He pauses at the door, heart thundering in his chest. There\u2019s a brief moment of panic at the fact that he didn\u2019t bring flowers, and he has to remind himself that it isn\u2019t actually a date. Before he can think of anything else as ridiculous as that, he rings the bell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door opens almost immediately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cH\u2014\u201d Wei Ying freezes in the doorway. He looks wonderfully soft, in a fuzzy cropped black cardigan over wide-legged burgundy jeans. His eyes go wide as he looks at Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blinking several times, he glances at his feet and says, \u201cUh, can I get you - uh, anything? Water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Lan Zhan. Wei Ying looks as flushed and distressed as Lan Zhan feels. Perhaps there is something wrong with the air conditioning in their flat?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should... We should head out,\u201d croaks Wei Ying, after what feels like an eternity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They walk downstairs in silence and get into the car. The drive is a short one. Lan Zhan is so distracted by the fact that he\u2019s alone in a car with Wei Ying on the way to a romantic restaurant that he nearly misses a stop sign.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Ying cries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The car screeches to a halt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, relax,\u201d says Wei Ying with a laugh. He reaches out for Lan Zhan\u2019s hands, white on the steering wheel from how hard he\u2019s gripping it. \u201cI know I\u2019m a bad influence, but running stop signs for me? Lan Zhan, I\u2019m impress\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan draws his hands away like he\u2019s been burnt. Wei Ying\u2019s fingers hover in mid-air, just over the wheel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cMy hands... sweaty.\u201d <em>Caveman</em>. \u201cYou are not a bad influence.\u201d\u00a0 Not even one of the cultured cavemen drawing pictures on walls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud snort. Lan Zhan watches in dismay as Wei Ying slumps over, laughing maniacally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah Lan Zhan,\u201d he manages to say, his words punctuated by helpless huffs of laughter, \u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d He looks up, shoulders still shaking, and reaches for Lan Zhan\u2019s hand again. \u201cI can\u2019t believe <em>you</em> get sweaty hands? That\u2019s so - sorry, I\u2019ve got to see for myself... ah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His voice trails off as his fingers make contact with Lan Zhan\u2019s palms. He traces it lightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan watches their joined hands till there\u2019s nothing but the sensation of Wei Ying\u2019s fingers tracing circles on his damp palm. Wei Ying isn\u2019t laughing anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d he says eventually, from a million miles away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you should start driving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks up with a start. The signal is green, and there\u2019s someone honking behind him. Ears growing hot, he tears his hand away from Wei Ying and starts up the car.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shintori isn\u2019t far, a nice Japanese restaurant that seems more Jiang Yanli\u2019s style than Jin Zixuan\u2019s. It\u2019s unexpected, but Lan Zhan has to grudgingly respect it. His best friend deserves nothing less than the best, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And if Lan Zhan is being honest, he\u2019d do a lot worse than dress in Wei Ying\u2019s favourite movie character\u2019s outfits if ever given the chance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They end up choosing a table in the corner, separated from the rest of the restaurant by a screen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better if we, uh, both sit on that side,\u201d says Wei Ying, pointing to the mats lined against the wall. \u201cSince we\u2019ll both be able to see through the other tables from there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees, maybe a beat too quickly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sit cross-legged on the mats. Lan Zhan sits on the outer side, his knee touching Wei Ying as he lowers himself next to him. Wei Ying doesn\u2019t move away, and neither does he.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a waiter brings them menus, Wei Ying pores over his with a wide grin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, this is a <em>fancy</em> restaurant. I\u2019m halfway through and I haven\u2019t seen a single item under a thousand yuan. I hope you\u2019re prepared to go home significantly poorer than you are right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying whips his head up to give him a look of bemusement. Lan Zhan wonders if he hadn\u2019t been plain enough. \u201cWei Ying can choose whatever he likes,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cPlease do not hesitate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To say it\u2019s probably not what Wei Ying had expected him to say would be an understatement. He stares at him for a long moment. When he buries his face in the menu card again, the back of his neck is pink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They order till Lan Zhan is satisfied they\u2019ve got every single item that had made Wei Ying\u2019s eyes sparkle with interest, and then they wait. They have a pretty good view of the restaurant including the entrance, and they soon spot Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan entering and taking their table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d whispers Wei Ying. He leans closer to Lan Zhan. Jiang Yanli looks stunning in a violet slip dress and her hair up in a bun. \u201cUgh, look at him pulling out a chair for A-jie. Patronising piece of shit - A-jie, if you don\u2019t break that chair on his face by the end of this date\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales, and gives him a look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, whatever, maybe he\u2019s trying to act like a decent human being. He could still be - No, he still <em>is</em> fake, an asshole, crass, pretentious, an asshole\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pouts, settling against his side. \u201cI\u2019ll catch him in the act by the end of the night. Just you wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d is all Lan Zhan can manage, with the warm weight of Wei Ying leaning into his side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They wait.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And wait.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And wait.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli takes a sip of water. Jin Zixuan rubs his palms on his trousers. Jiang Yanli calls the waiter over. She reaches over to point something out on the menu in front of Jin Zixuan, the top of her head nearly touching Jin Zixuan\u2019s forehead. Jin Zixuan rubs his palms on his trousers again. They order, and make conversation. Jiang Yanli laughs occasionally, and Jin Zixuan nods a lot and talks less than he normally does and looks horribly earnest the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s... sweet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Granted, Lan Zhan spends most of the time trying to memorise the way Wei Ying feels next to him. Arm to arm, thigh to thigh. But Wei Ying continues to pout as he watched the scene, so Jin Zixuan must be pretty good at the upstanding gentleman act.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan glances down at him. It\u2019s a mistake. This close, he could count Wei Ying\u2019s eyelashes if he tried. His lips look very soft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembers in excruciating detail just how soft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, what\u2019ll you treat me with if I\u2019m right and Jin Zixuan actually turns out to be the piece of shit I know he is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything you want,\u201d Lan Zhan says, without thinking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His ears feel warm again. Next to him, Wei Ying shifts</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019ve messed this up</em>, Lan Zhan thinks as his stomach drops.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Wei Ying smiles softly down at his lap. \u201cYou know... I\u2019d like to keep swimming with you, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s heart springs to his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, I just...\u201d Wei Ying looks up at him, and Lan Zhan is thankful he\u2019s sitting down because it\u2019d be pretty hard to stay upright with Wei Ying smiling at him so brilliantly. \u201cThese past few days, swimming with you... really reminded me of when we were kids, at that summer camp... I know you hated me, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid not hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Wei Ying, breathless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever hated you,\u201d says Lan Zhan, firmly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be nice, I know I was annoying, trying to get my big sister\u2019s best friend to look at me all the time\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were not annoying,\u201d says Lan Zhan. Perhaps a little, but it was nothing compared to his own shameless feeling for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Wei Ying flushes. \u201cWell, what I was saying is that... I know I only started swimming again a year ago, but these past few days... I remember how it used to feel, winning those races back when we were kids. Of course, couldn\u2019t ever stand a chance in the backstroke ones because of you, but...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c2012,\u201d says Lan Zhan at once. \u201cIt was the qualifiers, but you did beat me at backstroke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying looks at him wide-eyed for a moment, then burst into laughter. \u201cWe were thirteen, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you remember that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou swam well that time,\u201d says Lan Zhan simply. \u201cYou helped me improve for the next races.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cWell, I - I remember because I was super annoying to Jiang Cheng about it. You actually looked at me for once that day. I remember, at the finish line.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d <em>I\u2019ve</em> <em>been looking at you since we were eight years old.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I - ah, keep getting distracted,\u201d says Wei Ying, sounding flustered again. \u201cYou\u2019re distracting, Lan Zhan! It\u2019s just that.. these last few days, I\u2019ve been thinking of how it felt. Competing. I\u2019m a lot more rusty than I used to be, and I\u2019m almost halfway through my degree, but I - I think I want to try out for the university swim team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes go wide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Ying had started swimming again, Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t hoped he\u2019d ever compete again. Just the thought of Wei Ying starting what he\u2019d loved so much again was enough. But this, and knowing that in some small way he had a hand in it\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm?\u201d Wei Ying blinks up at him. He waits as Lan Zhan tries to gather his thoughts to formulate a response that would sound slightly less caveman-like.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI - \u201d Out of the corner of eye, something approaches. Something clothed in violet, making a beeline towards the bathroom that would take them right past Lan Zhan and Wei Ying\u2019s table. Oh. <em>Oh</em>.\u00a0 \u201cI see your sister coming,\u201d he says, and turns to face Wei Ying completely, in an attempt to hide his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Wei Ying, frowning. He cranes his neck, peering over Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder. Then he hisses, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He curls into himself, trying to make himself as small as possible and hide from view against Lan Zhan\u2019s front.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, they\u2019re very close. Too close. So close that Lan Zhan can almost feel Wei Ying\u2019s soft exhales against his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think - I think we should kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s - not what Lan Zhan expected to hear. Ever. In any plane of existence. So he stares back at him, stunned into silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI...\u201d Wei Ying grips the front of his shirt. He licks his lips, his eyes fixed on the sliver of skin just above the topmost button. \u201cShe\u2019ll see me. I think... you should kiss me. Then, maybe she\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan never hears the rest of that sentence, because he\u2019s weak, and the boy he\u2019s been in love with for all these years is asking him for a kiss.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lunging forward, he presses his mouth against Wei Ying\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a soft noise of surprise. Lan Zhan isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s him or Wei Ying. It doesn\u2019t matter. Suddenly, nothing matters other than the reality of Wei Ying\u2019s lips pressed against his. The same mouth - <em>Wei Ying\u2019s</em> mouth - that he\u2019d clumsily kissed in a dark room when they were fourteen. Heart hammering till he\u2019s sure the whole city could hear him, he studies the shape of them again. Soft, closed-mouth kisses first. How is it that they feel even softer and sweeter than the dreams he\u2019d had about them? He brings one hand to cradle the back of his neck. He rests the other at his waist. Wei Ying arches against his hand, tightening his fingers in his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan breaks, tugging Wei Ying desperately closer and into his lap and he whimpers in surprise, his lips falling open. Lan Zhan holds him in place and licks his way into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opens his eyes at some point, as if to make sure this is real. It\u2019s a mistake. The sight of Wei Ying in his arms, cheekbones flushed pink as he pants into his mouth is enough to make his brain melt to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He squeezes his eyes shut, continuing to kiss Wei Ying with everything he has, touching him everywhere, the hand on his hip travelling southwards, biting gently at Wei Ying\u2019s lower lip\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying moans into his mouth, and the moment shatters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tears himself apart and pushes away from Wei Ying. Wei Ying throws a hand out to stop himself from tipping over. He doesn\u2019t look up at him, and something breaks inside Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI - I will take care of the bill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gets to his feet, stumbling as he does. His legs feel like jelly. Wei Ying is frozen in place, a faraway look in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan tears himself away, walking to the front desk with his head lowered. He has no idea how long they\u2019d been kissing, if Jiang Yanli had returned to their table or if Jin Zixuan could see him. He places a wad of notes at the front desk and pushes through the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is halfway home when he realises he\u2019d forgotten the car at the restaurant. He turns and begins to retrace his steps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The busy traffic of downtown Shanghai at nine in the evening has nothing on the jumble of half-formed thoughts in his head. He\u2019d kissed Wei Ying. Really kissed him, with no blindfold to hide the reality of what he\u2019d done.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d be lying if he said he hadn\u2019t pictured this before. His first time kissing Wei Ying - at least, his first time with Wei Ying knowing it was him he was kissing. He\u2019d cup Wei Ying\u2019s face, gentle and careful. Kiss him soft and slow, maybe touch his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except - he\u2019d had to go and put his tongue in his mouth, touch him everywhere with his sweaty palms, <em>bite</em> him, and ruin everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not that there was anything to ruin in the first place, of course. It was supposed to be a distraction. Wei Ying had <em>said</em> that. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s any other conceivable reason he\u2019d ask Lan Zhan to kiss him, after all. Funny how things turn out - the first time Lan Zhan had kissed him, he\u2019d convinced himself it was a distraction. The second time, Wei Ying had meant for it to be only a distraction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d also been in his lap, flushed and breathless and <em>perfect</em>, and Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t been strong enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cold terror grips his insides suddenly as he wonders if Wei Ying may not even have expected a real kiss. Perhaps he\u2019d meant for them to pretend they were kissing, so that people wouldn\u2019t recognise them. Lan Zhan tries to recall the exact words he\u2019d said, but his brain had gone too cloudy right about the moment Wei Ying had said <em>kiss</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Standing in the middle of the bustling pavement, it happens all over again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying on his lap, his fingers gripping his shirt. Wei Ying\u2019s mouth, sweet and hot against his. The firm muscles of Wei Ying\u2019s sides, built from years of swimming. The way his spine had arched against his hand. The way his waist had fit in his palms, the unexpected softness of his hips\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, watch it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He starts as someone pushes past him, his stomach churning even harder at the stench of alcohol. He feels exhausted all of a sudden, his legs unbearably heavy, but he keeps walking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he reaches Shintori, he pauses at the entrance for a long moment with his heart in his throat. There\u2019s a wild moment when he wants to run inside and see if Wei Ying is still there, waiting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a ridiculous thought, of course. Wei Ying must have moved on a long time ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan has lost track of time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes up every day at thirty seconds to 5 in the morning, brushes his teeth, exercises, takes a shower and sits down to practise the qin on his balcony at a quarter past five. He eats breakfast, reaches his first lecture by eight, leaves campus by five, and studies in his room till dinner time. Then he goes to sleep by nine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything\u2019s right back to how it was. Just as it should be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s understandably surprised when his brother knocks at his door and informs him someone\u2019s at the door for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He makes his way to the door and finds quite possibly the last person he\u2019s expecting to see at his doorstep. Now or ever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll keep this short,\u201d says Jiang Cheng.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d says Lan Zhan. He can\u2019t help it, Jiang Cheng always has been his least favourite Jiang sibling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave much better things to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs do I.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng clenches his jaw. \u201cMy brother. He isn\u2019t taking part in the fucking swim team tryouts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Lan Zhan. In the moment he replays Jiang Cheng\u2019s words in his head as if to make sense of them, his head starts to feel extremely light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck happened to him, but. You. Need to fucking fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut... Wei Ying said he would take part. He told me, only last\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know what you guys talk about!\u201d Jiang Cheng says loudly, making a face. \u201cI checked the applications after practice today, and saw that he\u2019d cancelled his.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. Why?\u201d He replays the conversation they\u2019d had in the restaurant three days ago, just before he had gone and ruined everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think I am, a fucking fortune teller? I don\u2019t know what goes on in that idiot\u2019s head. I even asked him a couple times the last few days if he wanted to do some practice laps, but the dramatic little shit would just go all mopey at the mention of swimming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan remembers the colour in Wei Ying\u2019s cheeks as he told him how he\u2019d remembered what swimming used to feel like when he was younger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d continues Jiang Cheng. \u201cYou need to fucking do something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, the fucking rabbit behind you. Yes, you, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d he yells, when Lan Zhan actually looks behind him at the cage he keeps his bunnies in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t... Wei Ying and I, we\u2014\u201d <em>Nothing\u2019s changed</em>. \u201cWe are not friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng snorts. \u201cNo shit, you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng assesses him. \u201cYou don\u2019t lie. You really are that dense, huh...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan bristles at that, coming from Jiang Cheng of all people. \u201cYou drank swimming pool water because Wei Ying told you it would make you grow taller.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng clenches his fists. \u201cYou waited in the water to catch my brother when he jumped from the highest diving platform because he told you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBoys, is everything okay?\u201d a voice calls out pleasantly from behind them. Lan Huan is holding his door open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, brother, everything is fine,\u201d Lan Zhan says, turning to address him. Looking back at Jiang Cheng, he mutters, \u201cHe could have... hurt himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a kid\u2019s swimming pool,\u201d Jiang Cheng snorts. \u201cPretty sure his ass ended up hurting <em>you</em> more when he fell on top of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have been visiting a dog therapy cafe in secret for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck did you\u2014\u201d begins Jiang Cheng, turning purple. \u201cYou - You left A-jie\u2019s twentieth birthday party midway and came back with a bag full of stolen chicken skewers because my brother had cravings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat cafe is owned by the Jins. And <em>that</em>... That was never confirmed. To be acquired. By the process of theft.\u201d<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take your wallet and we never found a receipt on you. That\u2019s fucking confirmation, friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was... drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking idiot, is what you are,\u201d says Jiang Cheng. He lets out a deep exhale. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason my brother started swimming again, a year back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan goes very still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, his quiet voice a stark contrast to the utter chaos in his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d he says. \u201cFor his twentieth birthday party, that sappy video montage thing of him growing up that A-jie asked you to make? That - That was it. He told me, when he came crying to my room in the middle of the night and asked me if he could start swimming again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t make sense. Yes, he\u2019d poured his heart into that little video that Jiang Yanli had requested him to make. Had chosen clips he\u2019d filmed over the years at swimming camp - of Wei Ying laughing, swimming, fighting with Jiang Cheng in the water, and just being as happy as the water always made him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But to think that <em>that</em> was the reason Wei Ying wanted to start to swim again, after so many reasons of thinking he shouldn\u2019t, giving up his big dreams so Jiang Cheng\u2019s parents would stop being so cruel\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t start crying,\u201d Jiang Cheng warns, with a shudder. \u201cOr expect me to give you a hug.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns to leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lan Zhan says quietly, just before he\u2019s out the door. \u201cFor telling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng nods curtly, and closes the door behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later in his room, Lan Zhan thumbs through the pages of his journal. He\u2019s been through all of it by now, but this time he\u2019s looking for the scraps of sheet music he\u2019d pasted over the years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli was the only one from the Jiang family who took those weekend qin lessons at the music school in their neighbourhood. It was a good thing, because the amount of concentration the qin demanded would have been impossible with Wei Ying in the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the years, Lan Zhan had built together a piece. Something to give a shape to the feelings he\u2019d never put into words. Something he\u2019d finally finished a year before, and would never share with the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Except perhaps his brother, who he lived with, and the neighbours, who\u2019d probably had enough of his qin playing every morning at six from his balcony. But besides that - no one.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not until now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three hours later, Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers pause over the keyboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The video he\u2019s just finished editing plays before him. He\u2019s woven in footage from their childhood at the swimming camp together with everything he\u2019s filmed at the university swimming pool the past week.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swims like he was born to, laughs as he hits the finish line, splashes around with his friends and siblings with a sparkle in his eyes and smiles when he\u2019s underwater as if he\u2019s finally home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s heart squeezes in his chest every time he watches it, even if he\u2019s made it himself and watched the individual clips hundreds of times before. Finally, he adds in the song he\u2019d composed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>for yilinglaozu</em>, he titles it and hits post.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the morning, he plays his qin for a full three hours. He expects the neighbours to complain about him playing the same song over and over any day now, but there\u2019s nothing else he wants to play. When he finally checks his phone, there are messages waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang</strong> <strong>Yanli (07:33):</strong> <em>Hey... What was that about? Call me? </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang Yanli (07:38): </strong> <em>That made me cry... I can only imagine what A-Ying must have felt watching it. I don\u2019t know what happened suddenly, but it\u2019s so thoughtful and sweet. I\u2019m proud of you.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[unknown number] (07:51)</strong> <em> This is Jiang Cheng...

It\u2019s a comment on the video he\u2019d posted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>yilinglaozu (04:33)</strong> <em> lan zhan?</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli seems a little too cheerful about the fact that her brother has been missing since last night. She\u2019s baking, and humming through it when Lan Zhan reaches their flat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYanli-jie,\u201d says Lan Zhan, standing in the doorway to her kitchen. The utter insanity of the scene hits him. He\u2019s posted what is essentially a love letter to Wei Ying for all the world to see, Wei Ying knows that he\u2019s Hanguang-jun, Wei Ying is missing on the morning of the swim team tryouts, and Jiang Yanli is baking. \u201cWhy are you baking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, cupcakes,\u201d she says, turning around to beam at him. \u201cHi, didn\u2019t hear you come in. Want to try the batter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked why you are baking,\u201d says Lan Zhan. This makes no sense at all. Jiang Yanli is acting like someone just got engaged. \u201cWei Ying is missing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, he is. It\u2019s fine,\u201d she says, waving a hand as Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes widen at the confirmation. \u201cHe\u2019ll show up. Here, try some of the batter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan thinks quickly. There\u2019s a thought simmering at the back of his mind, but he hasn\u2019t allowed himself to even think it fully yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen are the tryouts for the swim team?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry the batter first,\u201d Jiang Yanli pleads.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looks so happy holding out the spoon towards him, that Lan Zhan leans in for a taste. Besides, he needs answers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s today,\u201d she tells him. She\u2019s still smiling, but the look in her eyes is suddenly sharp and full of meaning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cI should... check.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Yanli tells him. \u201cYou should.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turns on his heels like he\u2019s in a daze, and walks towards the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The white noise that\u2019s been buzzing in Lan Zhan\u2019s head all this while is drowned out by splashes of water and cries as he approaches the main university pool that\u2019s reserved for tournaments. As he walks down the damp tiles, a quick cursory look over everyone crowding around the pool leads him to what he\u2019s been looking for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is third at the starting platform. Even with his goggles over his eyes, he\u2019s unmistakeable as he leans forward in black swim trunks, waiting for the whistle. There\u2019s an errant lock of hair that peeks out from under his dark red cap. Every muscle in his body is wound tight as he waits, frozen in place like a spring ready to uncoil.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the whistle goes off, and Wei Ying dives in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no way Lan Zhan could look away from Wei Ying. He shoots down his lane with immaculate form. Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t need to look at anyone else to know they could never compare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s heart thuds against his chest, faster and faster as Wei Ying leaves the others far behind - to hit the finish line in what is surely record time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He breaks the surface with a deep inhale and lifts his goggles to his forehead. He turns his head to the other lanes where the others are just reaching the finish line. Realising he\u2019s won, his face breaks into a wide grin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan turns and walks swiftly towards the exit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan walks home, enters his room and sits on his straight-backed chair at his desk. He opens his iPad to the last slide set he\u2019d been revising.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had messaged him on the way back. It was probably minutes after he\u2019d come out of the water. Why wasn\u2019t he celebrating with his friends?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Wei Ying (11:44): </strong> <em>hi</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Wei Ying (11:45): </strong> <em>i won... i\u2019m going to be on the uni team lan zhan</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Lan Zhan (11:46): </strong> <em>That is wonderful.

He\u2019ll start competing again, maybe even get scouted soon. Within the year, Lan Zhan guesses. He\u2019s had a late start but he\u2019s talented enough that it won\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying must be happy. It\u2019s everything he deserves, and Lan Zhan is happy for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing\u2019s changed. Lan Zhan tightens his grip around his stylus and continues to read.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is still bright and beautiful, and he still doesn\u2019t need spilt watermelon to ruin his day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An uncertain length of time later, Lan Zhan\u2019s phone buzzes by his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang Yanli (14:44): </strong> <em>Hey, just found a new recipe to try. Would be nice to film for your next vlog!</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lan Zhan (14:46):</strong> <em>I am studying for an exam next week. Can we schedule this later?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang Yanli (14:47): </strong> <em>Noooo I already thawed the meat :( Please please! I know you\u2019re already over prepared anyway.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lan Zhan (14:49):</strong> <em>I will be there soon.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan knocks at the door. When it opens, he finds Wei Ying in the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s brain is immediately wiped clean of every single thought he has had since the day he was born.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying opens the door wider to let Lan Zhan enter. It\u2019s probably a decent indicator of how fried his brain is that it takes a moment for him to register that Wei Ying is dressed only in a loose black tank top and obscenely tiny red shorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shuts the door behind him and faces him. Lan Zhan looks around the flat. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any noise at all, any indication that there\u2019s anyone else besides the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-jie isn\u2019t here,\u201d says Wei Ying. There\u2019s a rueful sort of smile playing at his lips. \u201cSorry. I told her to send those texts. I was right, at least now you\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers tighten over the strap of his backpack. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI - \u201d Wei Ying makes a frustrated noise, and steps closer towards him. \u201cLan Zhan, isn\u2019t there something you want to say to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI already did,\u201d says Lan Zhan shortly. \u201cI messaged you. Congratulations on making the team. It is quite an achievement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cI - Lan Zhan, you really helped me see how happy I was in the water again. And when I saw what you titled the video, and realised that you <em>knew</em>, and still wanted to - Lan Zhan, isn\u2019t there anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan think it\u2019s quite unfair of Wei Ying to seek a response from him as he steps closer and closer. His brain is growing foggier by the minute. Is there really no ventilation in this house? Do the Jiangs really live like this? Lan Zhan must remind Jiang Yanli sometime to get the air conditioning fixed. It wouldn\u2019t do for Wei Ying to keeps strutting shamelessly around like this, what if someone dropped by, what if someone else saw him looking like\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah Lan Zhan, you can look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Zhan, his voice strained. \u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what that really meant,\u201d says Wei Ying. He sounds breathless. He rarely sounds breathless, even after their most intense races. \u201cThe video you posted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>It means you\u2019re incredible, you\u2019re perfect, you should never doubt it, and I love you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I think Wei Ying is talented and should continue competitive swimming,\u201d he says instead. \u201cIt is... only right, and I am glad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying watches him for a moment, lips parted. \u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Ying. He sounds like he\u2019d been waiting. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s good to know. I think you are very talented too, at - you know, filming. Brought out all the - the emotions, and everything.\u201d He glances at his feet, lips falling close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d says Lan Zhan, because he feels like he needs to do something to change that look on Wei Ying\u2019s face. \u201cI knew who you were - your account, I mean. <em>yilinglaozu</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying glances up at that. Then he walks even closer, till his toes touch Lan Zhan\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he asks. \u201cLan Zhan, how long did you know it was me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan swallows thickly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it before you said... you cherish me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s ears burn. \u201cBefore,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Wei Ying\u2019s turn to colour. His whole face burns red, down to his chest. Lan Zhan wonders just how low that flush goes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I guess I should tell you then that I... I knew all this time, too,\u201d says Wei Ying. He shrugs like it means nothing, but the way he pinches fitfully at his nose suggests it might. \u201cThat you - You know... That you were Hanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s head spins. \u201cHow long?\u201d he asks quietly, when he can bring himself to speak again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cYou have this mole on your left third knuckle\u2014\u201d He huffs out a laugh. \u201cSorry,\u201d he adds, when Lan Zhan\u2019s face crumbles. \u201cI start laughing when I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are nervous?\u201d says Lan Zhan. Nothing makes sense anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying squeezes his eyes shut for a moment. \u201cYou just found out that I sent you all those messages, knowing it was you,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat other emotion could I possibly be feeling right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Could watch you playing with your bunnies all day.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Of course you\u2019re husband material, that\u2019s not the point!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You\u2019re perfect.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan replays those comments and messages he\u2019d told himself a hundred times over were for Hanguang-jun. Not Lan Zhan in real life, not ever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except Wei Ying had <em>known</em> all this time, and still told him all those things. To <em>Lan Zhan</em>, not Hanguang-jun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just - I couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d Wei Ying says, \u201cYour followers are just so thirsty, and I had to take matters into my own hands... Lan Zhan, some of them are really out of control! And I thought you wouldn\u2019t recognise me but then you started to respond to my flirting, and I - I was so jealous it drove me insane but I couldn\u2019t stop because at least as<em> yilinglaozu</em> you\u2019d talk to me and I just... Lan Zhan, why would you keep replying to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pauses for a moment. He\u2019s too light-headed from everything Wei Ying has just said to make up an excuse. Besides, he\u2019s already embarrassed himself enough - what\u2019s the worst that could happen anymore?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he says, \u201cI thought it was the only way I could keep talking to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a long pause. Wei Ying looks like he\u2019d just been punched in the face. \u201cWhat?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, I know I am not the kind of person you would want to be friends with. I understand. But I - I thought I could keep talking to you if you did not know who I was. I deceived you, and I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Wei Ying\u2019s voice is strained. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me all this while?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Lan Zhan. Something Wei Ying had said a minute back hits him just then. \u201cYou were jealous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had me thinking you\u2019d flirt with any random commenter on your channel while I couldn\u2019t get you to talk to me after everything I tried!\u201d Wei Ying says, turning his face to the side. \u201cBut I thought if I - if I kept talking to you it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, because there\u2019s no way you\u2019d know it was me, and I could pretend it was me you were talking to, not <em>yilinglaozu</em>\u2014\u201d He says the name with a petulant twist of his mouth that Lan Zhan wants to kiss away at once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that you would only talk like - like that to someone like Hanguang-jun. That you would not anymore if you knew it was me,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cI was afraid what I would end up telling you if I - if I was truthful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying licks his lips, and steps even closer. \u201cThe truth?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan exhales. The boy he\u2019s been in love with for as long as he can remember is standing in front of him, asking for the truth. \u201cI like Wei Ying,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a beat. And another. And a third.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan likes me?\u201d repeats Wei Ying, flushing harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Once he\u2019s told him, he can\u2019t stop. He\u2019s so, so in love. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh...\u201d Wei Ying looks flustered, his face bright red now. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right, Lan Zhan is Lan Zhan, and I\u2019m only your best friend\u2019s annoying brother! And - you never even looked at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan has always thought that Wei Ying deserves to be loved desperately and wholeheartedly. He thought Wei Ying should be reminded of it too, thoroughly and often. Only he\u2019s always thought Wei Ying is better off not knowing this from <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Wei Ying is looking at him in disbelief now, as if he can\u2019t wrap his head around the fact that Lan Zhan had ever looked at him. It would be laughable, if Wei Ying didn\u2019t actually look so confused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighs, and finally says the words he\u2019s held back all this time. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at you since we were eight years old,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the kiss,\u201d presses Wei Ying, \u201cIt grossed you out, didn\u2019t it... That\u2019s why you left...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I thought I took advantage of Wei Ying that time,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cYou only wished me to pretend to kiss you so it would look\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He never finishes that sentence because Wei Ying moves the final few inches that separate them to kiss him, his hands coming up to wrap around his neck. After a long, glorious moment, he tears apart to press his face into Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable! You\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d he wails. \u201cThe nerve of you to say I only wanted to pretend to kiss you... I can\u2019t believe I spent all these years of my youth liking someone who could be so <em>dense</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Years?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pries him off his shoulder to look at him. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says sternly. \u201cYou are no better. You thought I never looked at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swallows. \u201cYeah, well, you kept glaring and looking off into the distance when I caught your eye? I, on the other hand, was practically throwing myself at you at every opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought you were... trying to get a rise out of me,\u201d Lan Zhan admits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had me get jealous of myself!\u201d Wei Ying cries. \u201cYou were fine flirting with <em>yilinglaozu</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had me... feel the same about Hanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a noise of frustration and leans in to kiss him again. But Lan Zhan places a hand on his shoulder and holds him back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, like it\u2019s a warning. \u201cI am in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives a tiny shake of his head, like he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s hearing. Perhaps Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t clear enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn your fourteenth birthday,\u201d he presses. \u201cDuring the blindfolded game...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was you?\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe kiss in my bedroom... Lan Zhan, was it you?\u201d says Wei Ying urgently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan feels his ears burn. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was wrong, I know. I was too\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my first kiss, Lan Zhan. I - I wanted it to be you so badly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Lan Zhan,\u201d says Wei Ying in exasperation. \u201cDo I need to tattoo it on my forehead? Because I will, don\u2019t test me. You\u2019re just so great, Lan Zhan, and I like you so much. I always have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Lan Zhan can\u2019t help asking. \u201cI am not the actor in the denim jacket. I am not Hanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It strikes him just how ludicrous that statement is for the first time as he says it out loud.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you on about?\u201d says Wei Ying. He curls his fingers in Lan Zhan\u2019s hair, shaking his head absently. \u201cDo you know how hard it is to survive when your big sister\u2019s best friend looks like you? Just chilling in the next room with her, looking like <em>that</em>, sweet and intelligent and kind and sexily intellectual while being so, so hot...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying thinks he\u2019s hot?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t finished either. \u201c... Of course I like you, I love you, it\u2019s never been anyone else, not since you got mad at me for not having my swimming cap on properly. Want you so much, want to swim with you every day, kiss you, tear those turtlenecks you wear off your body because they drive me insane with how fucking ripped\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan kisses him then, pulling him into his arms. Wei Ying likes him. Loves him, even. And he thinks he\u2019s <em>hot</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all too much, so he decides it\u2019s best to stop trying to think altogether.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kiss turns furious fast, and Wei Ying tightens his arms around his neck. If it was hard to hold back at the restaurant, it\u2019s impossible now. Knowing they\u2019re alone here, with Wei Ying pliant and willing in his arms, <em>thinking he\u2019s hot</em>, is almost more than Lan Zhan can bear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With an arm around Wei Ying\u2019s back and another at his waist, he steers Wei Ying over to the wall without breaking the kiss. Pushing him against it, he breaks away to kiss a trail down his jaw and the soft skin of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a flash of frustration at the narrow strap of Wei Ying\u2019s tank top, he yanks it off till it falls somewhere around his arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan - I can\u2019t...\u201d Wei Ying says, unable to stop talking again once his mouth is free. \u201cYou want me - I can\u2019t... Lan Zhan really wants me... Lan Zhan could have taken me whenever he wanted, but he left me waiting so long, and now he\u2019d better make it up\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heartbeat thudding in his ears at the shameless words, Lan Zhan grinds their hips together and bites at his shoulder. Holding Wei Ying so close, Lan Zhan is suddenly all too aware how little he\u2019s wearing. He takes both of Wei Ying\u2019s hands in his own and presses them against the wall over his head. Then he pins his wrists together with one hand over Wei Ying\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s so much Lan Zhan wants to do, he doesn\u2019t know where to start. He runs his tongue across Wei Ying\u2019s collarbones and shoulders, digging his teeth into the soft, lightly tanned skin on the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan - You\u2019re really killing me here... Those are going to leave a mark. That\u2019s so hot, please don\u2019t leave an inch of my skin unmarked, ever, for the rest of my life...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan rucks Wei Ying\u2019s top up under his arms and palms his lean, muscled torso. Panting, Wei Ying lifts a leg around Lan Zhan\u2019s waist for purchase. Lan Zhan lifts his other thigh around him till Wei Ying is suspended in mid-air. Then he lets go of Wei Ying\u2019s wrists so he can wrap his arms around his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a good look at Wei Ying, at the way he\u2019s splayed against the wall, flushed and panting and beautiful as locks of hair slip loose from his ponytail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says. Saying it loud makes it feel like it isn\u2019t a dream. No, it really is Wei Ying. Wei Ying really wants this. With him. And he likes him. Loves him. Looking thoroughly kissed - by <em>him.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a look Lan Zhan is going to make sure he wears as much as possible from now on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He runs his palm down Wei Ying\u2019s side, down his ass to the bottom of his shorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShameless,\u201d he murmurs into Wei Ying\u2019s neck, as he lightly skims his fingers over the skin of his thighs. The tips of his fingers slip under the fabric of his shorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying gasps breathlessly. \u201cMy bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cVery far,\u201d Lan Zhan says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so hot,\u201d Wei Ying babbles. \u201cRemind me next time, I\u2019ll - ah, I\u2019ll let you take me wherever you want in the house... or anywhere, but like - oh, ah - it\u2019s just been a fantasy of mine to just hold your hand and bring you into my bedroom and - and make out with you in my bed, so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t know which part of that string of words to focus on first. Wei Ying letting him take him? Wei Ying fantasising about him? A next time?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They make their way to Wei Ying\u2019s bedroom somehow - Lan Zhan carrying him half the way till he stops to press him up against the wall again to kiss some more. They stumble the rest of the way in each other\u2019s arms till Wei Ying is pushing him onto his mattress.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It hits him then that he\u2019s really in Wei Ying\u2019s bedroom. Whether in their big house back home or here, Lan Zhan has passed his bedroom door too often with his heart racing at the thought that Wei Ying was behind it. Later, after one too many fantasies set in it, it had started to a trigger a knee-jerk response in him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lying here now on Wei Ying\u2019s bed and staring at the ceiling, Lan Zhan thinks he\u2019s never going to be able to cross his door ever again without thinking of this. Wei Ying crawling over his body. Wei Ying unbuttoning his shirt. Wei Ying mouthing at his chest with his eyes fixed on his. He tightens his fingers in the sheets as Wei Ying enthusiastically licks his abs, then comes up to kiss him again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As they kiss, Lan Zhan\u2019s hand wanders down his almost bare back and reaches his ass. He palms it, wondering if it\u2019s possible to <em>die</em> from being too turned on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His brother would busy himself with finding a more palatable way to break the news to the rest of the family, suppressing his own feelings as always. His uncle would certainly pass out. Jiang Yanli would cry a lot. And Wei Ying - well, he wouldn\u2019t get to fuck Wei Ying and eat his ass, so that simply wouldn\u2019t do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slips his fingers under those demonically tiny shorts and rubs circles into his bare skin. Wei Ying bucks in surprise, the motion make him grind against Lan Zhan abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying gasps, his breath hitching as his toes curl and scramble at the sheets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rolling them over till he\u2019s on top, Lan Zhan tugs Wei Ying\u2019s shorts down in one swift motion. They kiss messily as Wei Ying fumbles with the fly of his trousers and finally takes him in hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan wants so many things his head spins. He wants to mark every inch of Wei Ying\u2019s skin like he\u2019d asked, finger him open, fuck him with his tongue for hours, then with his cock for days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it can wait. Because Wei Ying <em>loves</em> him for some reason he still cannot quite fathom, and they have all the time in the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes only a few quick strokes before they\u2019re both coming all over each other, exhaling against each other\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan has never laid in bed for a moment longer after he awakens. He has a routine, and it demands for him to be on his feet the moment he opens his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t always fall asleep in the middle of the day, and certainly not with Wei Ying curled against his side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not an ordinary day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan watches Wei Ying, till the elbow he\u2019s propped himself on falls asleep. He shifts then, but not before pressing a gentle kiss by the side of Wei Ying\u2019s brow. Maybe another, into his hair. A third, on his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone has been buzzing by his ear, so he reaches for it eventually.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang Yanli: (18:42)</strong> <em>Good evening, A-Zhan!</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang Yanli: (18:43)</strong> <em>No hurry, but let us know when we can come home!\u00a0 </em>(o\u00b4\u25bd`o) <em>I\u2019m at the library with Zixuan and A-Cheng is with Huaisang, so we\u2019re set as long as you need us to be!</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hurriedly responds.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Lan Zhan (18:45): </strong> <em>Please come home whenever you wish.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jiang Yanli (18:47): </strong><em>Really?
