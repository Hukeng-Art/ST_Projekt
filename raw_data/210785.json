I am numb.</p>\n<p><i>Inoperable. Deep. Intracranial pressure. Terribly sorry. Options. Arrangements.</i></p>\n<p>Sherlock sits next to me, legs crossed. He is calm. \u201cHow long do I have?\u201d is all he asks.</p>\n<p>The neurosurgeon is a classmate of mine from Bart\u2019s. He\u2019s a good man. He is looking at me with sympathy, presuming what they all do. I don\u2019t mind so much. \u201cA month. At the outside.\u201d</p>\n<p>I have more questions but Sherlock is on his feet. \u201cThank you, Doctor. Come, John.\u201d And he is out of the room. I start to follow.</p>\n<p>\u201cJohn \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d says my old friend. \u201cWe can make him comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>I laugh. I\u2019m surprised to hear it come out of my mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s never been comfortable in his life. No need to start now.\u201d</p>\n<p>We say nothing on the cab ride home. I am staring out the window. <i>Look at that. Look at the world, still turning. I feel like I\u2019ve fallen off.</i> Sherlock\u2019s fingers drum on his knee. He is out of the cab before it\u2019s hardly stopped and into the flat, running up the stairs. Then he\u2019s into his files. Looking, tossing, stacking. I have no idea what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>I just stand there. \u201cSherlock.\u201d He doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cSherlock!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in examining my emotional state right now, John, which is clearly your object.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen how about your physical state?\u201d</p>\n<p>He snorts. \u201cGiven what I\u2019ve just been told, what could possibly matter now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d He tossed down a folder and turns to face me. \u201cThat I have a month to live?\u201d The words strike me like the deep thump of heavy gunfire, at the base of my spine. \u201cI suspect that it\u2019s you who needs to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, all right, I do. Sherlock\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy only concern is how long I\u2019ll be able to continue my work before I am incapacitated.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m incredulous. \u201cYour <i>work?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops, finally, and faces me. \u201cI depend on you for truth, John. So give me truth now.\u201d</p>\n<p>I take a deep breath. <i>Detach. Float it away like a balloon. Tether it to you so you can draw it back later.</i> \u201cYour headaches will get worse. You\u2019ll begin to experience aphasia and difficulty speaking. Your balance will be affected, soon you won\u2019t be able to walk or stand. Your cognitive processes will be impaired and your vision will begin to go. You\u2019ll experience nausea, vertigo, pain and muscle weakness. Eventually you will lose consciousness.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cYou are no doubt aware that the balance problems and aphasia have already started.\u201d I nod back. \u201cI have no desire to go through all that, John.\u201d He meets my eyes. He looks calm, but I know him as no one else does, perhaps as no one ever has. And I can see right now that Sherlock is scared.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t watch you go through that.\u201d Worse than the thought of losing him is the idea of watching his mind deteriorate, vaguely aware that it once was special and amazing but unable to remember how or why. Seeing his boundless energy trapped in a body that will no longer obey his commands, laid low in misery by the foreign growth deep inside his brain.</p>\n<p>I know what he wants. God help me, it\u2019s a relief. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His face softens minutely. \u201cI know you will.\u201d Then his granite composure is back. \u201cNo injections.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m momentarily puzzled. \u201cThat\u2019d be the simplest way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t have any suspicion cast upon you. It must be believable that I did it myself. Are there pills?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. They\u2019ll take a bit longer. Half an hour. But it\u2019ll be painless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Lay in the pills and we\u2019ll take it one day at a time. I will continue to work and you\u2019ll tell no one of my condition, understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>I understand. I understand that I can\u2019t obey this request and he knows that I can\u2019t, but that everyone will preserve the gentle fiction that no one knows. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll decide when it\u2019s time. Whoever wishes to see me, I suppose I ought to allow it, but I will spend the last day alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>My throat tightens. \u201cAlone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. So I hope you\u2019ll be able to beg off the surgery that day. It\u2019ll be short notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Relief swamps me. \u201cAh. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears something in my voice and takes a step closer. \u201cJohn. When I said \u2018alone\u2019 what I meant was\u2026\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cWell. I hope that\u2019s acceptable to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Acceptable. My best friend has just informed me that he\u2019d like to spend his last day on earth alone with me. There is no part of that which is acceptable.</p>\n<p>My mind has not yet touched the reality that he is leaving. I can barely remember life without him in it. He\u2019s slyly inserted himself into all my memories, as if he\u2019d been there all along. He\u2019s there in Afghanistan, sitting on the next cot, commenting on the other men, bothering me when I\u2019m trying to stitch someone up. He\u2019s at Bart\u2019s, interrupting my study time to drag me over to the morgue, stealing my textbooks and marking them up in red pen when he finds errors. He\u2019s at school with me, at home, in the park I played in as a child.</p>\n<p>I stand in our living room and watch him go back to his files. At some point over the past two years he and I have become a hybrid. Sherlock-and-John. The graft has been so complete that even when we\u2019re separated, for days or weeks as has occasionally occurred, I still feel the invisible seam that joins me to him. For a moment, I\u2019m angry. Because he won\u2019t be the one who\u2019ll have to cut away half of himself and go back to being a singular entity. John-and-[redacted]. The seam will remain, though. I will bear the scar down my center to remind me of what I\u2019ve lost.</p>\n<p>We introduce each other as flatmates. What we really mean is that we\u2019re friends. People sometimes assume that we\u2019re lovers. None are accurate descriptions. I\u2019m not sure the English language has a word for what we are. Harry once called us \u201chetero life partners.\u201d Sherlock liked that. It made him laugh. I don\u2019t know if that covers it, either. We\u2019re just \u2013 well, we\u2019re just us.</p>\n<p>All I know is that there is a deep pit in my chest and it\u2019s yawning wide and hollow and in a minute it\u2019s going to swallow me and I can\u2019t let him see that. \u201cI need to go out for awhile,\u201d I say. My guilt at leaving him alone given the news he\u2019s just been given is mitigated by the knowledge that he\u2019d rather be alone than have to deal with me expressing any emotion.</p>\n<p>He just gives me a terse nod. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>I turn and clatter down the stairs. My stomach is cramping. I have to hold onto the wall for a moment. I make it outside and hail a cab.</p>\n<p>I keep it together until I get to Sarah\u2019s. Yet another relationship in my life that defies categorization. Girlfriend? No. Friend? Yes, but more. Shag buddy? On occasion. These terms might apply, except she\u2019s been more privy to what I go through with Sherlock than anyone. She knows about the seam. It\u2019s made us unable to have what we started out hoping for, but yet unable to retreat into a safe zone of friendship. So we hover here in the land of undefined. She dates other people. I just have Sherlock.</p>\n<p>She sees my face and pulls me inside. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m shaking. \u201cSherlock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he done now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone and gotten himself a bloody brain tumor.\u201d</p>\n<p>She holds me while I have an honest-to-God sobbing breakdown of the sort that I probably ought to be embarrassed about, but somehow living with Sherlock\u2019s perpetual detachment has left me remarkably unselfconscious about whatever it is that I feel myself. I\u2019ve become an avatar for his humanity. I must express all the emotion that he suppresses, so I end up doing double duty.</p>\n<p>I tell her about the pills I need, and about Sherlock\u2019s plan. I half-expect her to object, but she just nods and offers her assistance.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll be before he\u2019s \u2013 had enough?\u201d she asks, quietly.</p>\n<p>I am holding a cold washcloth over my swollen face. I can\u2019t go home looking like this. \u201cI don\u2019t think more than a couple of weeks. It\u2019s going so bloody fast, Sarah. I first noticed he was having headaches just last week, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d I hear my voice cracking.</p>\n<p>Sarah smooths the hair back from my temple. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, John.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t fair. Why him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019s \u2013 we need him. People don\u2019t know what he does, how <i>much</i> he does.\u201d I scrub at my face with the damp cloth and let my head fall back to the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back. I need time off work. He shouldn\u2019t be alone. He may need medical help at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shakes her head. \u201cOf course. But that isn\u2019t why.\u201d I just look at her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to admit it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you want to spend as much time with him as possible before the end.\u201d</p>\n<p>My lip trembles again. <i>The end. The end of him. God, it can\u2019t be true.</i> \u201cI thought there was all the time in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah hugs me again and I cry some more. I feel silly but it\u2019s best to get it out now. I can\u2019t do this in front of Sherlock.</p>\n<p>And she\u2019s right. As soon as I\u2019m back home, I won\u2019t be leaving his side again.</p>\n<p>He works. I don\u2019t go to the surgery. We take case after case. He doesn\u2019t sleep, so neither do I. I catch quick naps when he\u2019s taking a bath, or when he\u2019s busy with something I can\u2019t help him with.</p>\n<p>I take Lestrade aside and quietly explain the situation. He looks stricken, but he pulls it together quickly. I promise to let him know when the decision is made. I do the same for Angelo. I know that he\u2019ll spread the word.</p>\n<p>Sherlock is adamant that we not tell Mrs. Hudson. For once, I agree. If we do, we\u2019ll never keep her out from underfoot. We\u2019ll wait until it can\u2019t be put off any longer.</p>\n<p>Sarah brings me the pills. Two pills, white and smooth. I keep them on me at all times. He will not take them without my assistance, and it\u2019d be like him to grow frustrated and just say to hell with it, swallow them down in a fit of pique, and the notion of coming back from the shops and finding him \u2013 well. I keep the pills on my person.</p>\n<p>For a few days he seems no worse. Then, that tightness in his face that signals a headache stops going away with the painkillers I give him. He stumbles now and then. I stand closer to him when we\u2019re out at crime scenes.</p>\n<p>One week after his diagnosis, I find him throwing up in the bathroom. He is pale and sweaty. I give him some compazine and it seems to help.</p>\n<p>That day he has his first significant aphasia episode. He stands there ready to lay it out, and suddenly the words won\u2019t come. I see his jaw working, his eyes, his mind ready to show us how the clues fit together, and words won\u2019t come to him. He looks up at me with panic behind his eyes, just barely visible behind the veil that always cloaks Sherlock\u2019s emotional state, the veil that normally only I see behind, and then only rarely. \u201cJohn,\u201d he stammers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I say, pointing to something, anything not related to what he was about to say.</p>\n<p>He looks away. \u201cIt\u2019s a late-model Citroen.\u201d And he takes a deep breath, comes back and is able to lay out his deduction for us. Sally is frowning. Lestrade sighs and we exchange a quick glance.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s starting.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m coming home from the shops and I meet Mycroft coming down. He looks pale and worn. \u201cOh, John,\u201d he says, mildly. \u201cSorry I missed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have waited until I went out to come by,\u201d I say, irritable. If Mycroft thinks I\u2019m that stupid then he hasn\u2019t been paying attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cSherlock had some business matters to discuss with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019d better get upstairs.\u201d I don\u2019t have time for him right now.</p>\n<p>Sherlock is sitting in the leather chair, his legs folded under him. He motions me into the other chair. \u201cSit down, John. There\u2019s business. I dislike wasting time on such things, but it seems to be necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>I sit down. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He holds out some paperwork. I recognize it. It\u2019s a durable power of attorney agreement. \u201cIn the event that our plans go awry,\u201d he said. \u201cShould I collapse or have a dramatic downturn, you\u2019ll be empowered to make medical decisions for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I would have thought that I\u2019d have some feeling about this, but I don\u2019t. It\u2019s as he says. Just business. The business of dying. I sign the papers. \u201cThere.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s frowning. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so \u2013 equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t need it. You\u2019ll do this on your terms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve updated my will. You get everything, except a few items of family sentiment that will go to Mycroft. Feel free to distribute anything of mine to any acquaintances as you see fit.\u201d</p>\n<p>I sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t want what was yours, Sherlock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen burn it all,\u201d he says, an edge coming into his voice. \u201cWhat difference does it make? Everything of mine is yours anyway, none of it matters, and I won\u2019t know what\u2019s done with my possessions either way, so take what you like of me and put out the rest for the dustmen.\u201d</p>\n<p>I just look at him. He looks back. I am deafened by the noise of all that we\u2019re not saying.</p>\n<p>Two days later Sherlock stumbles twice and nearly falls. The second time I guide him to a nearby bench and sit him down. He has been very quiet this day.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t see out of my right eye, John,\u201d he whispers. I can hear a tremor in his voice. \u201cIt went away about half an hour ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>I just nod. \u201cWe should go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case is almost done. Let\u2019s finish it.\u201d He looks at me, pleading.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I could stop this,\u201d I whisper.</p>\n<p>He reaches out and grabs my hand. I grip it tightly. I profoundly do not care if anyone gets the wrong idea.</p>\n<p>We finish the case. Sherlock hangs on to me as we climb the stairs to our flat. His balance has gotten alarmingly worse just in the last day.</p>\n<p>I sit him down and take his blood pressure. It\u2019s high. His pulse is racing. He has a temperature. His pupil response is uneven. He can read the results on my face. I start to get up and he holds me back. \u201cJohn,\u201d he says, and I know what\u2019s coming.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I murmur.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>I meet his eyes. \u201cPlease, Sherlock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs. \u201cFriday night, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is the plan. Two days\u2019 notice. The first day will be for the people in his life to just happen to drop by to ask him a question or give him something. The second day is for us.</p>\n<p>The pills feel very heavy in my pocket.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Sherlock\u2019s headache is so bad he can barely withstand light. I\u2019ve laid in some stronger analgesics for this, and they help. He insists on wearing his normal clothes. He pretends that he isn\u2019t planning on seeing anyone today, but he knows what\u2019s coming.</p>\n<p>Our first order of business is the one we dread the most. It\u2019s time to tell Mrs. Hudson. We go downstairs to her flat and sit her down.</p>\n<p>She weeps and clings to him. Sherlock hugs her back and assures her that he isn\u2019t in pain, that it\u2019ll all be very peaceful. She hugs me, too. She wants to come upstairs with us and look after us but Sherlock is insistent. We promise to call on her again tomorrow. She deserves an exception to Sherlock\u2019s \u201calone\u201d stipulation.</p>\n<p>Molly is our first visitor. She\u2019s making an extra-special effort to be cheerful and pretend that she\u2019s totally ignorant of everything she\u2019s not supposed to know. \u201cI\u2019ve been collecting some more tattoos for you,\u201d she says, handing him a stack of photographs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve made notes on the back with the information you always take, so you can file them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow thoughtful. I\u2019m sure these will come in handy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Molly is biting her lip. \u201cSo \u2013 I\u2019ve got a John Doe in. If he isn\u2019t claimed, you can come do that experiment with the kneecaps if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGrand. When will that be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to wait a week.\u201d She knows what she\u2019s saying.</p>\n<p>Sherlock smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her face crumples a bit, but she recovers quickly. \u201cI must be off,\u201d she says, jumping up. She looks down at him for a moment, then bends and kisses his cheek. \u201cGoodbye, Sherlock,\u201d she manages.</p>\n<p>He seems a little touched. \u201cBest of luck, Molly.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns and flees with barely a look at me. I hear her start to cry as she reaches the door. Sherlock fetches a deep sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope the others put up a better front,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Sally Donovan is our next visitor, and she\u2019s a terrible actress. She\u2019s far too cheerful and can\u2019t seem to bring herself to insult him as she normally would. It\u2019s unnerving. She leaves after only a few minutes, looking disgusted with herself. I corner her at the door. \u201cYou could have made an effort,\u201d I say, under my breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve this,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the more reason. I made it very clear that you all were to treat him normally. That wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019m I supposed to call him \u2018freak\u2019 and insult him when I know that tomorrow night\u2026\u201d She trails off. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorts. \u201cSome things don\u2019t change. Goodbye, John.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anderson shows up just after lunch. \u201cHere,\u201d he snarls, tossing a paper bag at Sherlock. \u201cThe fiber samples you wanted. You\u2019d better work some kind of miracle of deduction on them, too, because it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sherlock smirks. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be more than enough evidence even for you, Anderson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt boggles the mind that you\u2019re allowed anywhere near an official inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took the words right out of my mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll not stand here and be insulted by you!\u201d Anderson snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen take a seat, you\u2019ll be more comfortable!\u201d Sherlock snaps back, looking almost gleeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d He stabs his hands back into his gloves. \u201cYou are an insufferable bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a walking redefinition of ignorance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a nice life.\u201d Anderson stalks out of the room. I follow him to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I murmur.</p>\n<p>He looks at me and I swear he looks almost regretful. \u201cTake care of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p>\n<p>We barely have a moment\u2019s peace that day. Sherlock is glad for it. I\u2019m less so. I\u2019m jealous of the time he has left, every precious minute that goes by is one I don\u2019t get to spend with him, not as long as there are other people trooping through, one right after another. Some people he\u2019s helped stop by, just to bring him some pastries, no reason, just thought you might like these, oh I was just passing a florist and saw this bouquet and thought it might brighten things up in here, oh, these silly chocolates, I was taking them to my sister, you don\u2019t happen to want them, do you?</p>\n<p>Night falls. Sherlock hasn\u2019t been out of the chair much today. I need to see how his balance is, so during an intermission I get him up and watch him walk about. He seems more or less steady. I make him tea.</p>\n<p>Lestrade shows up just past eight. With him, we can\u2019t keep up the front, because there is some level of official business we must attend to.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can to make sure there isn\u2019t an inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the pills myself, of my own free will. But John could still be blamed for not stopping me. He\u2019s a medical professional, he has an affirmative obligation to prevent others from doing themselves harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll he has to do is say that he was out of the room and didn\u2019t know you\u2019d taken anything until it was too late.</p>\n<p>Sherlock nods. \u201cI suppose that\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the risk, Sherlock.\u201d Good Lord, I\u2019ve thrown myself in front of bombs and bullets and rampaging Vikings for this man, now he\u2019s worried about the risk to me?</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, sharply. \u201cI won\u2019t have you risk anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Lestrade says, \u201cI\u2019m about 98% that I can quash any kind of investigation. It\u2019s illegal, yeah, but in cases like this \u2013 most of us would just as soon look the other way, anyhow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sherlock doesn\u2019t look satisfied by this. \u201cI want your assurance that John won\u2019t come under any suspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lestrade nods. \u201cYou have it, to the best of my ability.\u201d He gives us a slantwise smile. \u201cMind if I run a few things by you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sherlock perks up. \u201cBy all means.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lestrade spends the next half hour outlining clues, circumstances, situations, and taking down Sherlock\u2019s thoughts. I sit on the arm of Sherlock\u2019s chair, interjecting when warranted, mostly just listening to the sound of his voice. At one point I look down to see that Sherlock is holding onto my jumper, just a slight pinch of my sleeve between two fingers on his right hand, as if he\u2019s just reassuring himself that I\u2019m there \u2013 or perhaps that he\u2019s still here.</p>\n<p>I pick up from contextual clues that many of the cases Lestrade is mentioning are very cold ones. Years back, even decades. I realize that it\u2019s his last chance. It\u2019s Sherlock\u2019s, too. I wonder if it\u2019s going to be harder for him to leave life, or leave his work. Is there any distinction between the two in his mind?</p>\n<p>We\u2019re expecting Mycroft at ten. Sarah slips in at nine thirty. I\u2019m surprised to see her. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d she says. \u201cHe texted me. Asked me to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m puzzled. She and Sherlock haven\u2019t had the most amicable of associations. I\u2019ve had moments when I felt like the flag at the center of the tug-of-war rope. My few male acquaintances always ragged on me because Sherlock inevitably won. They didn\u2019t understand. Sherlock always wins. He\u2019s like a celestial body with his own gravity well, trapping me in orbit.</p>\n<p>Sarah comes upstairs with me. Sherlock brightens to see her, and beckons her to come sit with him. He looks at me pointedly. \u201cJohn, could I have some tea, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod. He wants to talk to her alone.</p>\n<p>I linger in the kitchen, peeking out at them, their heads close together, talking intently. They don\u2019t talk for long, though. She stands up and I see her squeeze his hand. I pass Sherlock his tea and walk her to the door.</p>\n<p>When she turns around there are tears in her eyes. She hugs me tightly. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She pulls back. \u201cHe wanted me to look after you. He said, \u2018John will take it hard.\u2019 Wanted me to see that you eat and sleep. Right after, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. Someone\u2019s certainly sure of his importance.\u201d I go for levity and it falls extremely flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more that someone\u2019s got no more time for pretenses,\u201d she said. She meets my eyes. \u201cJohn, you must do what you think is right. I can\u2019t tell you how to feel. I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s true. I can tell you that he\u2019s dying and you\u2019re all he\u2019s thinking of.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m speechless.</p>\n<p>Sarah leaves and for a few minutes, we\u2019re alone. \u201cAre you tired?\u201d I ask, sitting across from him, our knees almost touching.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p>\n<p>I take a deep breath. \u201cSherlock, I have to ask one more time. Are you sure about your mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>He meets my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>He and Mycroft have decided that she isn\u2019t to be told until it\u2019s over. Sherlock\u2019s thinking is that it will be less cruel, less painful to her not to know anything until it\u2019s done. I think it\u2019s more cruel to deny her the chance to say goodbye. But on this point they are firm and in agreement as they rarely are about anything. I make one last-ditch effort. I\u2019m rather fond of Sherlock\u2019s mother, and I have a feeling she\u2019ll never forgive me for this. Not just for not telling her, but for having a whole day with him when she got nothing. \u201cShe ought to have the chance that all these other people are getting,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cMummy despises goodbyes, she\u2019s crap at them. She wouldn\u2019t know what to do. No, it\u2019s better this way. And it isn\u2019t just for her,\u201d Sherlock says now. His head is weaving a bit. Painkillers. He meets my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t, John. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t look in her eyes and do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>On impulse I reach out and grasp his hands. His long fingers twine around mine tightly, gratefully. \u201cI understand.\u201d I do, in a way. Sherlock has two equally horrible options. I suppose he has the right to choose the one that\u2019ll cause him the least anguish in his last hours.</p>\n<p>Then Mycroft is there, and I move aside to make room for him. Sherlock asks me to stay with his eyes, so I resume my perch on the arm of his chair.</p>\n<p>I feel that small tug at my jumper again. Hanging on by his fingertips.</p>\n<p>Mycroft seems a bit broken as he leaves. I\u2019m not sure Sherlock sees. He actually embraces his brother before he departs. He\u2019s not totally phobic about contact like that. He hugs Mrs. Hudson all the time, and he hugs me on a fairly regular basis. But he and Mycroft just aren\u2019t like that.</p>\n<p>Mycroft pulls me into the hall. \u201cI hope you know what I\u2019m trusting you with,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>I nod. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOddly, I never have. Not where you\u2019re concerned. Hmm. Interesting, that.\u201d</p>\n<p>When I come back upstairs, Sherlock is on his feet. He looks relatively steady. \u201cI think I ought to sleep,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>I grin. \u201cThere\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d hear you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles a little. \u201cWhat else does a man do when his work is finished?\u201d</p>\n<p>My grin falls away. Finished.</p>\n<p>I help him into bed once he\u2019s changed. \u201cJohn, I\u2026\u201d He stops, his mouth open, then waves it off.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, what is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs. \u201cI think I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, all right?\u201d He just looks up at me with large eyes. His illness and medications are stripping off some of his defenses. It\u2019s impressive he\u2019s retained as much of himself as he has. What he\u2019s been through, most people are reduced to blubbering shadows of their former selves.</p>\n<p>I change into pajamas and go back down to his room. I climb into bed with him. It does not feel strange to do so. He scoots closer to my side, just so he can rest his temple against my shoulder. We lie there for awhile, not sleeping. Eventually, Sherlock drifts off. I stare down at his slack face. I can\u2019t seem to look away. I can\u2019t think about the fact that in twenty-four hours I will never see this face again. It is all strange angles and hollows and unearthly pallor, made worse by his condition.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t sleep. I just watch him. I watch the rise and fall of his chest with his breath and I can\u2019t stop imagining the moment that I am soon to witness, and I catch the merest glimpse of the pain that is in store for me later. I can\u2019t allow myself to feel it now. I have to be present for him, for these last hours, I have to push it far from me until it\u2019s over, but I know. I know what I am in for.</p>\n<p>I hate the universe. I hate whatever forces govern it, be they deities or fates or the tides of randomness. Whoever or whatever they are, I hate them for bringing me into his orbit. I hate Mike Stamford for introducing us. I hate whoever it was who shot me and brought me home from Afghanistan. I hate Britain for the size of my pension that made me need a flatshare. I hate this flat for being charming enough that I didn\u2019t turn round and leave the first I saw it. I hate him for being interesting and drawing me in so thoroughly that I didn\u2019t say to hell with you, and find a boring flatmate.</p>\n<p>A boring flatmate. Do such things exist? Could I have had one? What would my life have looked like these past two years if I had? I don\u2019t know if I would trade life with Sherlock for anything.</p>\n<p>Even if it meant that my heart wouldn\u2019t be breaking now.</p>\n<p>He seems better in the morning. A temporary reprieve, but well-timed. We don\u2019t rush. Today is the day. His last day.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d I ask. The idea of choosing how to spend one\u2019s last day on earth is so horrifyingly complex that I\u2019m sure it would paralyze me, but I\u2019m equally sure that he has a plan.</p>\n<p>He is looking out the window, fully dressed, and for just a moment, it\u2019s as if nothing\u2019s happened. All is well.</p>\n<p>I hate everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go out,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOut? Where?\u201d I feel that jealous pull again. I need this time, damn it all. Where does he want to go?</p>\n<p>\u201cOut. Into the city.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. That might be all right. \u201cTake a tour around? Your favorite spots?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust so.\u201d He turns from the window. \u201cThere are three things in the world I really care about, so I\u2019d like to use this time to say goodbye to each. The first is my work. I took care of that last night. The second is this city. So let\u2019s do that now.\u201d</p>\n<p>I know the answer but I have to ask. Damn my insecurity. \u201cWhat\u2019s the third?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at me, vaguely scolding. \u201cJohn. Surely you don\u2019t need me to tell you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>We head out. We take cabs so as not to tire him. We go to Trafalgar Square. Hyde Park. We walk in silence. Sherlock\u2019s balance is tolerable, but he holds onto my arm. He looks around, taking everything in.</p>\n<p>We stop to rest on a bench by the river. I go to the railing and look down at the water. \u201cAre we going to talk about it?\u201d I finally say.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>I laugh, derisive. As if there\u2019s another topic on hand. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re going to die tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA great deal! Sherlock \u2013 I\u2019m\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He grabs my sleeve and pulls me back to sit on the bench. \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with it.\u201d He meets my eyes. \u201cI never expected to live a long life, John. Always thought I\u2019d meet my end at an early age. Never thought it\u2019d be like this, though. Thought I\u2019d be shot, or blown up. Thought at the very least I\u2019d take someone with me, someone the world needed gone. The idea never troubled me. It\u2019s only of late that the idea of leaving this life began to be \u2013 distressing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never had anyone to leave behind. Anyone who\u2019d miss me.\u201d He looks at me again and there is something raw behind his eyes. \u201cWill you miss me, John?\u201d</p>\n<p>My throat feels pinhole-thin. I swallow hard. \u201cTill the end of my days, Sherlock.\u201d</p>\n<p>The flat is quiet. We stop in to see Mrs. Hudson. She\u2019s keeping her composure. She hugs Sherlock again, then me.</p>\n<p>We go upstairs. I shut the door behind us. Night has fallen and I\u2019m adrift. I don\u2019t know what to do, or if there\u2019s a plan. He sits in his chair. I hover nearby. He looks up at me. \u201cWill you get the pills, John?\u201d</p>\n<p>My heart turns to ice and my stomach drops. \u201cNow? But\u2026now?\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is gentle. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of delay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point? I don\u2019t know, I just \u2013 does it have to be now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get the pills. So we\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>I go into the kitchen on numb feet and draw a glass of water. The pills are in my pocket. I put them in a small dish and go back into the living room. He is watching me. I sink to the floor in front of his chair, kneeling between his feet. I am holding the glass and the dish but I make no move to hand them to him.</p>\n<p>He reaches down and takes them from me, but he sets them on the table at his side. He leans forward, hands folded before him. \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t mind dying, John. It\u2019s what we all owe. And I\u2019m glad to be able to choose my terms.\u201d He pauses and waits until I look up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, except\u2026\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cExcept for you. I regret whatever pain this will cause you. I don\u2019t claim to know its nature. I only know that I have spent some time imagining how I would feel if our places were reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p>I am trying to memorize his face. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say until I hear it emerge. \u201cI really thought I\u2019d be spending the rest of my life with you,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>He smirks a little. \u201cThat\u2019s all you planned? Rather limited, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I mean \u2013 no matter what else happened, who else I met, or what else I was, before anything else I\u2019d be \u2013 this,\u201d I say, making a vague motion in the air between us.</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cI suppose in some sense, I am fortunate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFortunate? How?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do get to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>I am undone.</p>\n<p>I feel his hands on my hair as I weep, my forehead resting on his knees. I\u2019m helpless. I have failed. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to keep you safe,\u201d I say through my tears. \u201cI can\u2019t stop this. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t fix this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have fixed it, John. It\u2019s because of you that I can go out this way, the way I want.\u201d He slips a hand beneath my chin and tips my head up. He holds my face between his hands and rests his forehead against mine. I hang onto his wrists because I have to hang on to something. \u201cI am not a man to make pronouncements or confessions,\u201d he says, quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. I trust my actions speak well enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod. He releases me and backs off. He reaches for the dish and the glass. I get out my mobile and send two texts. One to Lestrade, one to Sarah. This is the arrangement. I send the texts when he takes the pills. They will each come to the flat in one hour. Lestrade will come for Sherlock. Sarah will come for me.</p>\n<p>Sherlock meets my eyes once more, then he swallows the pills with a drink of water. He sets the dishes aside with an air of finality.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s done. Over the next thirty minutes he will drift away.</p>\n<p>I stand up and his eyes follow me. I reach out for his hand and pull him to his feet. He is looking at me, puzzled. I lead him over to the couch and sit down in the corner. He gets the idea and sits next to me. I keep hold of his hand.</p>\n<p>He is breathing slowly, deliberately. I want to talk but I don\u2019t know what to say, or if it will help either of us. He looks at me. \u201cJohn\u2026\u201d he begins, and I see the fear in his eyes. \u201cI thought I was ready for this.\u201d His voice shakes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Sherlock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, John.\u201d I have never heard his voice so small.</p>\n<p>Nothing I ever do will ever be this important again.</p>\n<p>I pull him into my arms and tuck his head down to my shoulder. He is so thin. He folds into an unbelievably small space, fitted into my lap; my arms can encircle him completely. He grasps a handful of my jumper and lets out a shaky breath. \u201cJust relax,\u201d I whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>We are skating near the edge. Dull horror floods me. I desperately don\u2019t want to hear it. Just as desperately, I don\u2019t want to say it. Right now, I am losing my best friend, and that is bad enough. I don\u2019t know if I could stand to lose more. I cannot look at the future that we\u2019re now being denied and admit that we could have had anything other than the friendship I already know. If I look down that road which is now closed and see something else there, always glimpsed but never reached for, never acknowledged, it might really break me for good.</p>\n<p>But this isn\u2019t about me. If he needs it, then it\u2019ll be said. And God help me.</p>\n<p>I feel his limbs loosening. \u201cJohn,\u201d he says, and the word is slurred. \u201cNeed to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>I shift him around in my arms until we\u2019re face to face. His eyelids are slack. He is shaking. \u201cSherlock, just look at me. Don\u2019t think. Don\u2019t try to hang on. You just look at me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He does. His eyes flick over my face like he\u2019s trying to do what I was doing earlier, and memorize me. I know that I won\u2019t be spared, because he hasn\u2019t been.</p>\n<p>I kiss his lips, gently. I feel the tension sag away from him and his hand on my face. I hold him close, our foreheads together again. His eyelids are flickering now. He kisses me back, straining like it\u2019s taking the last of his strength. His hands clench in my jumper and his eyes blaze as he looks at me. \u201cI want you to be the last thing I see,\u201d he rasps.</p>\n<p>I hold his gaze. I feel every second like a blade against my skin but I hold it. I won\u2019t look away because this is sacred and I\u2019m long past the point of salvage anyway. He takes a few deep breaths and sags. His eyes close.</p>\n<p>He is sleeping now. It won\u2019t be long.</p>\n<p>I gather him close, wrap myself around him. I kiss his face over and over. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m talking to him but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. I may be telling him I love him. I may be telling him I\u2019ve never loved anyone else and never will. I may be cursing him for leaving me. I really have no idea. It doesn\u2019t matter. Those things are all true, whether I am telling him or not.</p>\n<p>He takes his last breath a few minutes later. Exhale, and then \u2013 nothing.</p>\n<p>I stare down at his face. It is not real.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t hear me now. So I say it all again and this time I know I\u2019m doing it. I talk to him until my voice gives out.</p>\n<p>Lestrade and Sarah are there. When did they arrive? They are leaning over us, their faces sad. Sarah is crying. Lestrade has come with the men from the funeral home who\u2019ll take him away. I won\u2019t let them. Sarah has her arm around me and finally she and Lestrade coax me into releasing him. I can\u2019t watch. I go to the window and Sarah hugs me from behind. I hear the rustlings and the wheels on the stairs and the clanking of the gurney and they\u2019re nearly gone before I stop them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. One moment.\u201d I must sound calm enough for them to stop when I say so. He is covered with a sheet. I go to the gurney and peel the sheet back.</p>\n<p>I just look. Perhaps I had something to say but it\u2019s gone now. It\u2019s too late. The man I\u2019ve lost wasn\u2019t just my best friend, not now.</p>\n<p>They take him away. Lestrade hugs me, and it\u2019s a bit alarming, but I need it. He leaves, and Sarah watches me like a hawk.</p>\n<p>I walk across the living room toward the couch. I make it halfway there. My legs slowly buckle and I am sitting on the floor, staring into space. She joins me there and holds my hand.</p>\n<p>I feel nothing.</p>\n<p>His funeral is well attended. This does not surprise me. Many people admired Sherlock. Many more couldn\u2019t stand him. But nobody who ever came in contact with him ever forgot it, and it seems as if all of them are compelled to be here.</p>\n<p>I am being treated as the grieving widower. Mourner in Chief. It really ought to be his mother, but everyone seems to think this arrangement entirely appropriate, including the woman herself.</p>\n<p>Despite my fears, she doesn\u2019t blame me. Mycroft says that she hates goodbyes and wouldn\u2019t have known how to handle Sherlock\u2019s, so it\u2019s just as well. She seems to understand this. She hugs me and tells me she\u2019s so glad that he had me with him in his final hours.</p>\n<p>I stand up to give his eulogy. I only do it because I can\u2019t imagine anyone else doing it. I talk about his brilliance, his dedication to his work. I talk about the people he helped and the criminals he brought to justice. I don\u2019t talk about how he made me feel alive, or the way his eyes glowed when the sunlight slid behind them from the side.</p>\n<p>I tell the mourners that he was my friend, and I am honored to have known and worked with him. I don\u2019t tell them that I loved him, and that I love him still, and that if I had one wish in the world it would be that I could make it stop.</p>\n<p>Sherlock\u2019s left me everything. He had more money than I suspected. He certainly had never needed a flatmate. But I\u2019d known for some time that my presence served many purposes, the very smallest of which was financial. I find myself well off for the time being. I take some time off from the surgery. I spend it reorganizing the flat.</p>\n<p>One night I open up one of his scrapbooks. Collections of crimes, deductions, examples. His notes scrawled everywhere in his spidery handwriting. I sit with it and I hear him taking me through it. I read the whole thing. Then I read the next, and the next.</p>\n<p>Within a month I have read everything of his in the flat. I\u2019ve brought in filing cabinets to organize his messy clippings. I can put my hand to any piece of reference I need within seconds. I don\u2019t know why I feel I must have that ability, but I have it, nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Lestrade calls me about six weeks after the funeral. \u201cStrange case,\u201d he says. \u201cMan found dead, not a mark on him. Locked room, no windows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I say, puzzled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you come?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re the next best thing, John.\u201d</p>\n<p>So I go. Everyone stares. I must look terribly out of place without a tall, black-clad figure by my side. I shut my eyes before I enter the room, and when I open them again, he is there with me.</p>\n<p>I look, and I see things I would not have seen before. I don\u2019t fool myself that I see all that he would have seen. But I see a great deal. It turns out that I see enough.</p>\n<p>I turn to Lestrade as I leave. \u201cI\u2019m not like him, Greg. I\u2019m glad to help if I can. But I\u2019ll be charging for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins. \u201cAs you like, Doctor Watson.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next time, I am faster. The time after that, I am more thorough.</p>\n<p>I sit at home with casefiles, and we talk it out. \u201cWhat do you make of the wallet?\u201d he asks me.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was at the gym the night before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d He\u2019s dubious. Sherlock never set much store by traditional routes of inquiry. Wallets, diaries, phone calls. Too obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a thick stack of cards in here. Credit cards, membership cards, bank cards. His cheque card is second from the back. That\u2019s the card most people use the most frequently, so he must have been in the habit of using his cards and then sliding them to the back of the stack. The gym card is at the very back, so he must have used it after he used his cheque card the last time. Most people don\u2019t go very long without using their cheque card, so he probably was at the gym the night before he died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>I smile. \u201cYou\u2019d never say that if you were really here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am wounded by that accusation, John.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sometimes I can almost see him. I shut my eyes and picture him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t answer. He never does when I say that.</p>\n<p>Six months out, I resign from the surgery. I have new business cards. John Watson, M.D. Consulting detective.</p>\n<p>Still the only one in the world.</p>"
