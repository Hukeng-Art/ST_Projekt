  "text": "<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s hardly a secret that Victor Nikiforov is a massive player. Yuuri\u2019s not blind, nor is he an idiot. God knows he spent enough years of his life obsessively following the man through the media; he knows Victor goes through his relationships - conquests - with startling frequency.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hell, Victor had once sent some starlet who was proving reticent to his charms twelve dozen roses, whisked her off to Cyprus for a week, and then promptly ended the relationship two weeks after in an impassioned shouting match at Kafe Pushkin. Media sensationalist reporting aside, Phichit had actually texted him to verify this one - he\u2019d been in Moscow at the time for some physio and had witnessed the tail end of it himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s relationships are like dynamite: sizzling to the explosive, dangerous finish.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, to reiterate: Yuuri\u2019s not an idiot. He knows how the game goes, even if he hasn\u2019t played it himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which is why, when Victor saunters up to him post-Grand Prix Finals, gold medal still looped and glinting around the elegant line of his neck, he\u2019s dumbstruck. Victor reaches out with one long finger and casually flicks the medal around Yuuri\u2019s neck, making a soft <em>clink.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGreat performance out there,\u201d he says in accented English. \u201cYour triple axel really is impressive.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri scrambles for the words, Detroit - and English - feeling ages away, even if he\u2019d flown straight to Russia for the Grand Prix Finals from the States. \u201cThanks,\u201d he manages to sputter. \u201cCongratulations to you too.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor studies him for a long moment, and Yuuri\u2019s all too aware that his cheeks are still unattractively flushed from the exertion of his Free Skate, and that he probably reeks of sweat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHave dinner with me,\u201d Victor says, breaking into a charming grin. \u201cUs medallists should stick together, no?\u201d He eyes Yuuri\u2019s medal again, expression sly. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019ve already got silver, there\u2019s only gold to go for next, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The man is <em>lethal.</em> It\u2019s also short-circuiting Yuuri\u2019s brain, just being in such close proximity to his idol scant minutes after being on the same ice as him. Everything feels surreal.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Celestino walks up to them before Yuuri can stammer out a reply.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAh, Nikiforov!\u201d he greets, clasping Victor on the shoulder. \u201cAnother feather in your cap, great job.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCelestino,\u201d Victor smiles, accepting the praise with a gracious tilt of his head. He gestures to Yuuri with a slight wave of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m just offering to show Yuuri here around Moscow.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBrilliant idea!\u201d Celestino claps Yuuri on the back, pride in his eyes. \u201cTake the night off, Yuuri, you deserve it. Good work on the quad salchow, I\u2019ll see you back at the hotel.\u201d He wanders off into the throng after bidding them both farewell.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI - I have an early flight tomorrow,\u201d Yuuri manages to say, all while maintaining the barest minimum of eye contact. God, Victor\u2019s <em>eyes.</em> They\u2019re even bluer in person. He hoists his gym bag further up his shoulder, ready to beat a hasty retreat. Yuuri takes a tentative step forward, but Victor, clearly not ready to give up the chase that easily, refuses to budge. All his attempt at fleeing has achieved is him standing far too close to Victor for comfort.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd I promise I\u2019ll have you back to your room by eleven,\u201d Victor says, his grin pure magnetism.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s never been the best at social interaction. He\u2019s anxious, easily flustered, and all too prone to bouts of intense moodiness. What friends he has are because of his figure skating, and they don\u2019t always hang out outside of training, Phichit as his roommate notwithstanding. To sum it up, he\u2019s spectacularly bad at saying no, especially when faced with the full force of his idol in the flesh, megawatt smile and all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI gu-<em>ess</em>,\u201d Yuuri reluctantly agrees, the words drawn out even as he continues to search for a way out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFantastic!\u201d Victor exclaims, a lone finger coming up to trail softly along his jaw. Yuuri swallows hard, and Victor pulls away, smile just <em>this</em> side of wicked. \u201cWhich hotel are you staying at? I\u2019ll come by to get you at seven.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri stammers out the address all while the nails of his free hand dig into his palm, pressing deep crescent moons into his skin. Victor keys his number into his phone and is gone with a wink and a flick of his quicksilver hair, stepping out to bask in the lights of camera flashes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri stands in the lobby of the rink for several minutes, disbelief running hot through his veins. He thinks back to his room in Hasetsu, with his collection of posters and memorabilia, and the actual man, larger-than-life. Yu-topia feels worlds away. He eyes the silver medal resting against his chest, and hears the din of the news crews beyond the entrance doors, just out of sight. He thinks of Detroit, and Vicchan, and his <em>okaa-san</em> and <em>otou-san</em> and Mari and Yuuko and Minako.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He thinks of home.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today - this Grand Prix - tonight - he\u2019s <em>earned</em> this. Years spent away from his family, anxious and crying into his pillow when the homesickness became unbearable; days and days spent at the rink and on the ice, falling and getting up and falling and getting up; hours spent at the gym, beating and working his body into submission - he\u2019s spent his whole life building up to this, and today is the first time it\u2019s really felt like it\u2019s <em>finally</em> paid off.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And if Victor Nikiforov wants to take him out to dinner and wine and dine him? Yuuri\u2019s going to let him, and he\u2019s going do his best to blow him away.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The closer it gets to seven, Yuuri feels his resolve flag in increasing amounts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He hadn\u2019t thought to pack a suit, what with the Grand Prix Finals weighing on his mind and the anxiety in his gut at the time, so all he has on hand are a couple of dress shirts and one pair of trousers which are slightly loose. It\u2019s six-fifty, so there\u2019s nothing to be done for it but to hitch it up with his belt, slick his hair back with some gel, and to fidget with the cuffs of his freshly-pressed white shirt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At six-fifty-seven, he slips on his black leather loafers, grabs his phone, wallet, and room keycard, and slips out the door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s tense on the elevator ride down, stiff but twitchy with nervousness.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The lobby of the Moscow Marriott Grand is smooth marble and warm lighting, his footsteps loud enough on the tile to cause him to wince as he makes his way through the lift bank.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s reclining against a pillar right by the floral centrepiece in the middle of the lobby, a bouquet of red roses in his hand. He\u2019s in a three-piece ensemble, black overcoat dark against the charcoal grey of his suit and waistcoat, the white of his dress shirt a stark contrast.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s so attractive that Yuuri can almost feel himself having panic attack. Steeling his nerves does little to stop the way his heart pounds when Victor spots him and does a slow once-over as he approaches. This feels almost exactly like the way he feels right before it\u2019s his turn to step out onto the ice, the spotlights and attention of thousands on him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor greets, smile blooming and spreading slow and appreciative across his face. He presents the bouquet with a flourish. \u201cThese are for you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAh - thank you,\u201d he replies, holding the flowers awkwardly. He\u2019s unsure what he\u2019s supposed to do with them. Does Victor expect him to keep holding them for the duration of this evening? He feels wrong-footed from the get-go, and his resolve dips. Yuuri mentally shakes himself, and rallies. \u201cGive me a moment, I\u2019m going to leave this with the concierge to send up to my room. I don\u2019t want to lose them over dinner,\u201d he says, and his smile is far more confident than he feels.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A quick, stilted exchange with the concierge in the little Russian he knows has the issue of the roses settled, and Victor leads him to the main entrance and out, pausing to hand the valet his ticket for his car to be brought round. Snow whirls around them, and the streets are bathed in white.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo, Yuuri,\u201d Victor says as they wait, eyes alight with interest. \u201cIs this your first time in Moscow?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He can\u2019t help the disappointment that unfurls fast and vicious in his chest, even as he tries to ruthlessly quash it. Victor wouldn\u2019t be the first professional skater he knows of not to take too avid an interest in his competitors - Leo\u2019d always said there wasn\u2019t any point in knowing how many medals or cups someone\u2019d won, since it wouldn\u2019t help you skate any better anyway. It\u2019s a sobering reminder that however tonight might end, there\u2019s nothing long-term about this to look forward to.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo,\u201d he says, and is proud that his voice doesn\u2019t waver. \u201cI was actually here for the Rostelecom Cup last month.\u201d Recalling his resolution to make the most of tonight, he quirks a small smile and tries his hand at being as charming as he can manage. \u201cWhat about you? Have you always lived in Moscow?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He knows the answer, of course - Victor only moved here when he was eleven, when it became apparent to everyone he was going to be <em>huge</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNot always,\u201d Victor answers, and Yuuri notes the way he doesn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cBut it\u2019s such a gorgeous city to fall in love with, is it not?\u201d He gestures to the snow-covered street in front of them, the streetlights casting an amber glow. \u201cOh, there we go,\u201d he says, spotting his car.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s car is sleek and beautiful, its clean and tasteful lines an echo of its owner. Yuuri doesn\u2019t know anything about cars, but even <em>he</em> knows an Aston Martin when he sees one. Victor tips and thanks the valet in Russian, motioning at Yuuri to get in.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Yuuri buckles in, curious.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNot far,\u201d he replies. \u201cAbout ten minutes from here if traffic is good.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Bon</em> is stylish, edgy, and devastatingly hip. The maitre \u2018d ushers them to a small, intimate table at the back, set into a wall and partially concealed from the rest of the establishment by heavy velvet curtains.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri is led, wide-eyed, past the Kalashnikov lamps, the dark, flocked wallpaper, and intricately dizzying<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>glass windows. Not for the first time, he wonders what he\u2019s gotten himself into.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor draws his chair out for him, Yuuri blushing as he pushes it in before rounding the table to take his own seat. With a happy glance around, Victor beams. \u201cSo? What do you think? It was <em>so</em> difficult to get a table here on such short notice, but I\u2019ve been promised it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri feels painfully out of his element. The glossy tableware and fine linen all serve to remind him that he is, at heart, a country bumpkin with little polish, silver medal or no. The restaurant is clearly expensive and exclusive, an enclave for the glitterati and who\u2019s who to gather and mingle, see and be seen. Yuuri would rather be in his hotel room, curled up in layers of jumpers and marathoning Netflix.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s very classy,\u201d he says, toying with his salad fork, almost wincing at the smudge he leaves behind before he catches himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor grins, satisfied, and leans back in his chair to launch into a discussion of the day\u2019s Grand Prix performances, easily and effortlessly drawing Yuuri into the conversation. The food is ordered and arrives - excellent as promised - and the whole affair is incredibly enjoyable. He feels like his heart could burst with disbelief.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri does his best to be convivial and engaging, and it seems to work, if the laughter he draws from Victor is any indication. The anxiety at being in a setting as fashionable as this even abates a little, and he can almost forget he\u2019s not a fish out of water here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ball of nervousness returns in force as dinner draws to a close, and all they are left with are glasses of dessert wine, sweet and heady. He\u2019s had two glasses of wine now, not counting the current one he\u2019s nursing, and he can feel the alcohol go to his head and loosen his limbs, even as the tension builds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri eyes Victor over the rim of his glass, a small voice in his head wondering at how many others Victor\u2019s showered this treatment on, and how naive he\u2019d have to be to believe he\u2019d be the last. He pushes that voice aside with more violence than necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ve had a very good time,\u201d he says, his attempt to pitch his voice to a more seductive timbre failing spectacularly, even to his own ears. Victor\u2019s ice-chip blue eyes are a hot brand on him, one corner of his lips quirked slightly upward, his chin resting on a downturned hand.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo have I,\u201d Victor says, his voice a low purr. Yuuri can feel his face burn, and knows from experience that an ungainly blush is spreading. The heat behind Victor\u2019s eyes is heavy, and he lifts his head from his hand. \u201cI\u2019m ready to leave if you are, but I\u2019m not ready to end the night yet.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s blush is out in full force now. He swallows hard, and knows that Victor tracks the movement of his throat as his Adam\u2019s apple bobs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNeither am I,\u201d he replies, and Victor smiles slowly, the blue of his eyes darkening with promise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sex is fantastic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s with <em>Victor fucking Nikiforov,</em> Yuuri doesn\u2019t think it could be anything but.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They barely make it back to his hotel room, stumbling into the doorway a tangle of limbs and clothes half-shed, lips pressing and gasping and impatient.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri wrangles his shirt and trousers off, nearly tripping in his haste, Victor tugging and touching and insistent at his back, naked and hard, and <em>oh god is he actually going to be doing this?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor nips at his ear, then his neck, and all hesitation evaporates at the feel of warm, large hands on his skin, stroking and coming up to tease his peaked nipples. Yuuri can\u2019t help the moan that escapes, and bites his lip at the warm huff of laughter this draws from Victor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAh, <em>moi sladki,</em>\u201d he hums, hands dipping lower, coming to cup at Yuuri through his boxers. \u201cSo ready for me. So gorgeous.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He can feel his flush deepen, spreading over his pale skin. Yuuri isn\u2019t ashamed of his body - not when he\u2019s put so much effort into keeping it in shape - but he\u2019s aware that he\u2019s never been considered particularly attractive. He turns in the circle of Victor\u2019s arms, and with an assertiveness that surprises himself, guides and pushes him down onto the bed, leaning over to kiss him long and wet as he disposes of his boxers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s hands come up to cup at his hips, tugging him down to grind their lengths together, their mouths and tongues still tangled and battling. His hands continue to trail down to the curve of his ass, fingers venturing further down, nudging and prodding, a silent question. Yuuri nods, and prays his uncertainty doesn\u2019t bleed through.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou have lube, <em>pryanichek?\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Russian sends a shiver down his spine, the foreign word guttural and exotic and a klaxon that yes, oh my god, he <em>really</em> is doing this with Victor Nikiforov.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>Bedside drawer,\u201d</em> he grits out. Victor moans between his thighs, their cocks still sliding over each other, the friction delicious and not nearly enough. It takes him a long moment to realise he hadn\u2019t said that in English, so he switches and repeats.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor is far too put-together for someone who\u2019s managed to unravel Yuuri to such a degree, the long line of his body stretching up to the bedside table in a graceful arch. Disgruntled, and the wine making him bold, he bends to nuzzle at the divot between his thigh and torso, inhaling the masculine musk and clean sweat. Victor pauses in his quest, eyes hooded, pupils blown.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Emboldened by the response, Yuuri traces little licks, moving further inward, stopping to nose at the base of his cock before rearing back to take him in his mouth, tugging his foreskin down.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s - okay, it\u2019s his first time doing this, so he\u2019s working off what he\u2019s seen in porn, but Victor seems to be enjoying it. He curls his tongue over the head, flicking over the ridge of his frenulum, then slides his tongue down along the base as far as he can go, taking him into his throat. Victor makes a short, aborted thrust, one hand curling lightly into his hair, and Yuuri presses on, laving his cock. When he flicks his eyes up to look at Victor, his face is faintly flushed, his eyes heavy with lust.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>Kotyenok,</em> if you keep doing that, I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be able to fuck you,\u201d he huffs, gently pulling Yuuri off his cock. Guiding him into his lap, thighs spread to either side of his body, Victor steadies him with his left hand on his hip, the right coming to close tight around Yuuri\u2019s cock. He tugs at him steadily before switching hands, the left coming back coated with lube, teasing at his entrance and then stretching him slowly, steadily, incredibly. He produces a condom and rolls it on.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCome on, on your back, there we go,\u201d he nudges, and Yuuri\u2019s thighs are spread, his arms at his sides and gripping the sheets, and Victor brushes a hand across his inner thigh, cock pressing gently at his hole. He pushes in in increments, swooping down to catch his lips as he bottoms out, and he\u2019s so <em>full.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri can\u2019t contain the small gasps that fall from his lips, gasps that turn into soft moans, then louder at Victor wraps a hand around his cock and <em>tugs</em> just as his cock nails his prostate, and then Yuuri abandons all pretence of attempting to remain silent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGod, yes, <em>yes</em>,\u201d Victor groans above him, his hips snapping, pounding into him, and the crescendo is <em>so</em> near, <em>so</em> close -</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri whites out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he comes to, Victor\u2019s pulling gently out of him, then getting up to dispose of the condom. His legs feel like jelly, and his muscles ache with pleasant soreness, the adrenaline of the day slowly leaving him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri pushes himself up on his elbows, tracking Victor\u2019s progress around the room. The condom goes in the bin under the desk, then boxers and trousers are pulled on.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Neither have said a word.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This wasn\u2019t unexpected, Yuuri reminds himself. He knew to expect this. Of course he wasn\u2019t going for anything more, and he did get a wonderful night out of it, didn\u2019t he? It\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted. If anything, he can at least say that for one night, he captivated the great and untouchable Victor Nikiforov, and that\u2019s more than most can say.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor finishes with the last of his shirt buttons, tucking the tails into his trousers as he finally turns to Yuuri. The smile on his face is gentle and sweet, but rueful.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI really had a lovely evening,\u201d he begins, and Yuuri just holds up a hand. He slides off the bed, the sheets pooling onto the floor, and pads over the Victor stark naked, bending to pick up and shake off his suit jacket.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He presses a kiss to his cheek, offering the jacket to him. \u201cSo did I,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor bends his head and seals their lips together, and it\u2019s still hot and electrifying and tangible. He breaks away to swing his jacket on.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The moment is strange, fragile yet unbreakable. It feels like a moment of turning and change. It feel like if Yuuri speaks out or does something, the whole course of his life could alter because of this one moment. He can almost see the threads of different futures spreading out from this single minute in time. The moment crystallises, and in an unexpected burst of confidence, just as Victor reaches the door of the room, he calls out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou know, if we\u2019re ever in the same city again, you\u2019re welcome to look me up. You have my number.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor throws a glance over his shoulder, face barely lit in the darkness of the room. He catches the edge of a lightning-sharp smile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI do, don\u2019t I? I\u2019ll see you around, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The door shuts behind him, the light of the hallway briefly illuminating the dim room, then fading back to grey.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri trains hard in the upcoming months, throwing himself into training with an abandon that surprises Celestino and is met with raised eyebrows by Phichit. He works on landing his quad salchow, and when he\u2019s landing that a <em>lot</em> more often than not in practice, asks to have the quad flip put on his roster.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To say that shocks Celestino is putting it mildly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou can win the Grand Prix without it, you know,\u201d he advises.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not enough if I don\u2019t,\u201d Yuuri pushes back, insistent. \u201cI need to get better. Improve. I can\u2019t keep doing triple axels.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His first tries at the quad flip go dismally. He lands on his ass, then on his front, then on his side in a particularly bad fall that requires icing and a week off practice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI can do it,\u201d he still insists. \u201cI need to.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Celestino sighs, unused to but pleasantly surprised at his recalcitrance. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it another go.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He spends so much time on the ice that he skates even in his dreams, and sometimes he forgets he <em>isn\u2019t</em> in the rink and stumbles on normal ground.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It pays off, though.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Yuuri, gifted but without the shining talent that comes with the territory for the true stars like Victor and Jean Jacques, hard work has been his only recourse. Can\u2019t do it on the first, second, or tenth try like they can? It\u2019s alright, he\u2019ll get it on his hundredth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first time he lands a quad flip, he whoops so loudly that Phichit, who\u2019d been on his way into the rink, told him he\u2019d startled a flock of birds on a tree into flight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then he lands his second, then third, then fourth, and the figure keeps climbing until the competitive season dawns on them, fast and daunting, and he\u2019s confident enough - and Celestino\u2019s confident enough - to add it to his roster.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When it\u2019s announced in a press bulletin, he wonders what Victor\u2019s expression might be, if he could see it. If Victor would have even noticed.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When Celestino approaches him to talk about his routine for his programmes, he\u2019s struck with a sudden burst of inspiration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ve picked out a few songs for your Free Skate here, so you should go through these and let me know which one sounds good by Thursday.\u201d Celestino hands him a memory stick.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He musters his courage. \u201cIs it - is it okay if I pick my own music, this year?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Celestino blinks several times, clearly taken aback, but he recovers quickly. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s always been an option for you. We don\u2019t have much time left, so can you get a selection together by Thursday? And think about your Short Programme, too.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s putting through a call to Phichit as soon as practice ends, and after several rapid-fire emails and brazen begging, by the time Thursday rolls around, he thinks he\u2019s got it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He waits anxiously as Celestino listens to the piece, earbuds in either ear. He can see the music winding down on the CD player, and when Celestino removes the buds and doesn\u2019t say a word for several seconds, Yuuri fears the worst.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Celestino looks at him, and his eyes are searching, measured. \u201cSomething\u2019s different about you, Yuuri.\u201d He waves at the Walkman in his left hand. \u201cThis is good. <em>Really</em> good. I\u2019m expecting a lot from you this season. We\u2019ll begin work on choreography.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Relieved, Yuuri sags. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll, uh, keep looking for something for the Short.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He clasps him on the shoulder. \u201cKeep it up. Any idea what you might want to title this?\u201d He holds up the disc in one hand, a Sharpie in the other.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Blushing down to his roots, Yuuri takes the pen, and with a mounting sense of determination, inks the title that\u2019s been floating around in his mind since he heard the piece.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Celestino peers at it when it\u2019s done. \u201c\u2018Yuuri on Ice\u2019,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI like it. Great work. Whatever you\u2019ve been doing, you keep doing it. This season\u2019s going to be yours. I can feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The choreography is demanding, the hours on the ice exhausting. But the first time he completes the whole routine flawlessly, nailing his final quad toe loop, he <em>knows</em> it\u2019s all worth it. The muscle aches and bone-deep tiredness fade under the smooth slide of his blades on the ice, the quiet moments in the air ripe with anticipation as he takes off for his jumps and hangs, suspended for a brief second, and lands in perfect balance.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And when he turns on the radio one morning, eyes bleary as he shuffles into his en suite to brush his teeth, and he hears <em>the</em> piece, his body snaps to instant wakefulness.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Celestino\u2019s no longer shocked when he brings the music to him, but he\u2019s still slightly astonished, which means Yuuri knows he\u2019s on the right track. He\u2019s going down a different path this season.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Celestino asks, eyebrows raised.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ve never been surer,\u201d he reassures, and he can feel the rightness of it settle in his bones.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The assignments are published in June, and Yuuri\u2019s going to Paris for the Troph\u00e9e de France, and then back home to Japan for the NHK Trophy, assuming he makes it through the first competition - which he\u2019s going to. He <em>will</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As much as he tries to stop himself, he can\u2019t help but search for Victor\u2019s name among the assignments, eyes moving of their own volition.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He nearly starts when he sees that Victor\u2019s been assigned to the Troph\u00e9e de France as well, after Skate America. There\u2019s never been any doubt that Victor wouldn\u2019t make it through the first round, after all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Paris dawns bright, fast, and unforgiving on the heels of his training and practices. He can\u2019t help but follow Victor\u2019s progress through Skate America<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>- gold, of course<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>- his routines flowing and fluid, graceful and effortless.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s equal parts inspiring and demoralising. So Yuuri keeps his head down, pushes himself on the ice and off, and runs through his choreography so many times that he catches himself doing it subconsciously off practice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And when Yuuri finally steps off the plane and into the overcast Parisian morning, he can almost feel a shift in the air, a whisper of promise that beckons to greater heights.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s pushing six in the evening before the Troph\u00e9e when his mobile buzzes with a text.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>I hear we\u2019re both in town,</em> it reads. It\u2019s from an unknown - foreign - number, and Yuuri almost drops his phone in shock. He recognises the +7 Russian dialling code.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s - there wouldn\u2019t - it <em>couldn\u2019t</em> be anyone else.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>I\u2019m at the Hilton Opera,</em> he types out, and forces himself to hit <em>send</em> before he can overthink it. He presses a hand to his flushed face, and regulates his breaths. Before he can question his decisions further, he picks up his phone again, and types <em>Room 157. I\u2019ll have the front desk leave a key for you. </em>He sends it, and places a call down to the reception to ask for a key to be side aside.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Struck by his sudden bravery, he catches sight of himself in his lumpy hoodie and track bottoms in the mirror by the desk. Keenly aware that <em>Victor Nikiforov</em> would soon be making an appearance - at least, he hopes - he leaps into the shower.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he emerges, bathroom billowing steam, there\u2019s a text waiting for him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>;) ,</em> it reads.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They don\u2019t actually have sex again - blowjobs before don\u2019t count - until after the Troph\u00e9e de France, when the silver medal once again hangs low on Yuuri\u2019s chest, the gold adorning Victor\u2019s.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019d been little on his mind since but the look on Victor\u2019s face when Yuuri\u2019d glided out onto the ice, head tilted, hip cocked, arms loose at his sides, and <em>On Love: Eros</em> started playing. He\u2019d shot Victor the cocky smirk he spent hours perfecting in the mirror, and then there hadn\u2019t been anything but the long glide of his blades and the exertion of his body, fluid with the music.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And the next day, when Yuuri\u2019d nailed the quad toe loop at the end of his Free Skate, the lust in Victor\u2019s expression was full-blown.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The press went - is still going - wild. <em>New Katsuki Yuuri!!!</em>, headlines proclaim. <em>Has he found a secret passion???</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But that - all that -</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s nothing on his mind now but the slow burn of Victor in him, pushing and pulling and thrusting in the sweetest, slowest friction.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cGod, <em>tigryenok,</em> you\u2019re perfect, so good, so tight for me,\u201d Victor moans, and his words are a jumble of endearments and praise and Russian that mixes together into a heady combination in his low, smooth voice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They relearn each other\u2019s bodies long into the night, a montage of limbs woven together in embrace, of lips pressing and searching and sucking, of hands stroking and teasing and scratching.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor fucks him on his back, then on his front, and then with Yuuri straddled across his lap, bouncing and sweaty and unravelled.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s gone by morning, and all traces left of him are pressed into Yuuri\u2019s skin in a collection of bruises that would perfectly fit the curve of his long fingers and match the bow of his mouth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s fine, Yuuri never expected anything else.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri blazes through the NHK Trophy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He breaks the 100-point barrier in the Short Programme, and comes so close to breaking the 200 in the Free Skate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The media is going crazy, whipped into a frenzy by his performances, the underdog from out of nowhere.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He stands high on the podium - the highest for once in his life - and forces himself not to flinch under the scrutiny. Phichit waves at the crowd next to him, silver medal looped around his neck.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Yuuri!\u201d he yells, struggling to be heard over the din of the rink and the shouting of the press. \u201cI knew you could do it!\u201d Phichit\u2019s grin is beatific and infectious, and Yuuri can feel an answering smile break out on his face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They go out for celebratory drinks that night, him and Phichit, Leo, and Guang Hong. They sing shitty karaoke at a bar in Shibuya and go for late night <em>okonomiyaki</em>, drunk on sake and beer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the privacy of the lift at their hotel, Leo and Guang Hong begging off to their own, Phichit presses a kiss to his lips. Yuuri, stunned, kisses back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s nice and pleasant, but it doesn\u2019t make him <em>feel</em> anything.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Phichit breaks the kiss, leaning back to smile sweetly at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAh, that\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he says, shaking his head slightly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri apologises, wrong-footed and not wanting to lose one of his best friends.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Phichit waves him off. \u201cNo, no, I expected it. Can\u2019t blame a man for trying, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The lift <em>dings</em> as it arrives at his floor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Yuuri - and I mean it. You\u2019re my best friend, nothing\u2019s going to change that. I\u2019m so proud of you today.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Phichit steps out, sending a smile his way as the doors shut behind him. As he ascends to his floor, Yuuri feels conflicted.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He stumbles to bed in a haze. He fishes his phone from his pocket to charge when he notices he has a new message - a trophy emoji and <em>!!!!!</em> - from Victor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shrugging off his clothes and changing into a comfy sleep shirt, he can\u2019t help the small smile that tugs at his lips.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019ll deal with everything tomorrow. It\u2019ll all work out.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he wakes up, it\u2019s to the insistent <em>buzz</em> of his mobile, vibrating a racket and lighting up the dimness of his hotel room.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He has eleven missed calls and twenty-one texts from Mari, Minako, Yuuko, and - oddly - one from Phichit that reads <em>I\u2019m so sorry!!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Confused, he unlocks his phone to scroll through the mountain of messages, all variations of <em>OMG!</em> and <em>Is this for real??!?? Yuuri!!!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dread curdles at the back of his throat, and he pulls up a gossip site on his mobile browser.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>LOVE BLOOMS ON ICE AND OFF!</em>, the headline on the front page all but yells. The surveillance photo is grainy, but it\u2019s unmistakably of him and Phichit in the low light of the lift, kissing. Instagram photos of their night out follow: a selfie with Phichit, Leo, and Guang Hong at the <em>izakaya,</em> arms slung around shoulders, then a photo of him and Phichit singing some stupid song at the karaoke bar.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Flopping back onto the bed, Yuuri lets out a low groan of frustration. There\u2019s a voicemail from Celestino instructing him to lay low to avoid the press camped in the lobby, and that he\u2019s in talks with the hotel about the privacy violation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor doesn\u2019t text.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It dies down, as it always does, and the news cycle moves on. There\u2019s some gossip on the grapevine that Victor\u2019s been seen about with Christophe Giacometti.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s not - Yuuri\u2019s not going to say that it doesn\u2019t <em>hurt,</em> because it does, but he knew what he was getting himself into.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He gives himself a day to mope, curled up under the blankets of his room and binging on ice cream. He knows how it goes: Victor loses interest as quickly as the tide shifts, and he moves on to someone else. Victor\u2019d probably seen that photo of him and Phichit and figured it was time to cut his losses. There were bigger and more beautiful fish to fry.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019d made him feel like the centre of his world for two nights, desirable and something to covet. He\u2019d shown him what pleasure <em>truly</em> felt like beyond his own two hands and a dildo. He\u2019d made him feel wanted. He\u2019d made him feel - not on <em>top</em> of the world, not yet, but rocketing there at supersonic speeds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri throws himself back into practice, honing his routine into perfection. He lands his jumps with precision, arches his fingers to exact angles, and works out the flourishes that breathe <em>life</em> into his performances.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Grand Prix Finals are only two weeks away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even now, heart slightly bruised and feeling like crap, he can taste victory.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor still doesn\u2019t text.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">(Not that Yuuri\u2019s waiting.)</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Palais Omnisports in Marseille is a massive building, gleaming glass reflecting the glinting sunlight that peers out from behind clouds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s a day to the Final.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s muscles aching from practice, sweat dripping uncomfortably down the hollow of his shoulder blades, Celestino finally gives him leave to take off for the day.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He runs into Victor in the locker room by the rink, because it\u2019s just his luck that he would.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s expression is congenial enough, a polite smile gracing his lips.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHello, Yuuri, it\u2019s good to see you,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s no warmth behind it, no spark in his glacier-blue eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cVictor,\u201d he stammers, \u201cI -,\u201d he\u2019s cut off by the sound of approaching footsteps, and they both turn to face the newcomer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri recognises Yuri Plisetsky immediately. It would be hard not to, with the sheer amount of animal prints the youth seems set on wearing at any given opportunity.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis him?\u201d Yuri says, eyes on Victor and a sharp jerk of his chin in Yuuri\u2019s direction. Whatever Yuri sees on Victor\u2019s face must satisfy him, because he breaks his gaze off to direct it at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d he spits, and there\u2019s far too much venom in his voice for someone who\u2019s only just met Yuuri.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bewildered, Yuuri takes an unconscious step back, hands coming up to clutch at his chest in a nervous gesture. \u201cEx-ex<em>cuse</em> me?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor snaps something at Yuri in Russian that makes the teen huff and stalk away, but not before sending a glare Yuuri\u2019s way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHe\u2019s still young,\u201d Victor says, and it\u2019s not really an apology for whatever the <em>hell</em> just happened, but Yuuri nods along.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">More footsteps sound from behind them, echoing off the walls of the locker room, and Phichit comes into view, cheerful grin on his face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHey, Yuuri, Leo was just texting me about - \u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whatever Phichit meant to say dies when he spots Victor, standing a few feet from Yuuri, the tension in the air a palpable thing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor is the first to break the silence, bending to grab his duffel and slinging it over a shoulder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYuuri, Chulanont,\u201d he bids, tone frosty, and makes his exit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri and Phichit are left behind, the former baffled and the latter bemused, to stare wide-eyed at each other. After a good few seconds, Phichit speaks, eyebrows raised high into his hairline.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI have <em>no</em> idea what just happened.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That night, Yuuri\u2019s phone <em>beeps</em> with a text that nearly sends him into a fit of histrionics.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>The Four Seasons, Room 697. There\u2019s a key at the front desk.</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The +7 number mocks him. Sighing, he finally thumbs at his phone to add it to his contacts, biting his lip as he saves it under \u2018Victor\u2019.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Still. There\u2019s the elephant in the room, and Yuuri\u2019s moving to tug a coat on over his t-shirt and jeans before his mind catches up to the fact that he\u2019s already arrived at a decision.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He doesn\u2019t know what this means, that it\u2019s the first text in weeks after their run-in this morning and that it\u2019s the first time Yuuri\u2019s going to Victor instead of the other way around.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His palms are sweaty and his pulse rabbits the whole cab ride over.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor fucks him hard and fast that night, hands and lips bruising, careful to mark only below the collar and under any sleeve lines.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s rough and brutal, a harsh slide inside him that leaves Yuuri gasping and moaning low, drunk on pleasure and Victor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s so close to coming, pushing that final, vicious edge of orgasm when Victor deliberately slows his thrusts, barely rocking at all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cPlease,\u201d Yuuri whines, scrabbling at his shoulders, canting his hips to get at that maddening friction. He\u2019s <em>so close.</em> \u201cFaster, please,\u201d he pleads.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s something almost cruel in Victor\u2019s eyes when he bends to nose at Yuuri\u2019s jaw, tongue darting out to lap at the tender skin of his neck.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFaster, please, <em>Victor,\u201d</em> he demands, unforgiving, still keeping his hips rocking at an unsatisfyingly slow pace.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For several seconds, Yuuri\u2019s brain is too caught on the pleasure and the building insistence of his orgasm to understand what Victor wants.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When his mind catches up, he\u2019s nodding furiously, gasping out the words.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFaster, please, Vic-<em>tor</em>,\u201d he moans, and chokes out his name again when the hard rush of his release overwhelms him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Clean up is quiet and slow, Yuuri lethargic and feeling oddly disconnected. When he\u2019s dressed to leave, Victor catches him by the chin, pressing their mouths together in a bruising kiss. His eyes are dark and demanding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he says, voice rough, \u201cWhen you skate <em>On Love: Eros,</em> don\u2019t you <em>dare</em> think of anyone but me.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Orgasmic night aside, Yuuri\u2019s nerves are back in full force.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s in a chair in the holding room by the back, eyes fixed on the far wall. He can\u2019t stop his knee from bouncing up and down, and his palms are damp and clammy with sweat. His heart is pounding, and his stomach is in knots.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Two performances to go until it\u2019s his turn.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s <em>here,</em> at the Grand Prix Finals again for the second year running, and the collective weight of the expectations of his family and country rests on his shoulders. His nails burrow deep welts into his palms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s on screen, gliding and soaring and glorious under the lights and adoration of millions. Yuuri\u2019s not watching, but he can hear the TV behind him and the cheering crowds beyond the doors of the holding room.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s sensational. He always is.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When Yuuri steps out onto the ice, his pulse hasn\u2019t calmed, and the butterflies haven\u2019t left. But he spots Victor standing rinkside, just off the Kiss &amp; Cry, gaze intent, and Yuuri thinks that he can do this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Image of Victor seared into his mind\u2019s eye, he cocks his hip and angles his head.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The music starts, notes high and insistent. He runs his hands down his body in undulating movements, tongue darting out to swipe at his lower lip. He flicks his chin and smiles, weighty and seductive.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>Don\u2019t you dare think of anyone but me. </em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He doesn\u2019t see Victor that night, at the end of the first day, and Victor doesn\u2019t text. But there\u2019s a tangible sense that something\u2019s shifted between them, a change in their dynamic negotiated in lines on the ice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri leads in the rankings, putting up a personal best of 107.61 on his Short Programme, just edging out Victor\u2019s 106.92.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever led Victor on the leaderboard.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s an exhilarating feeling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019d never thought he could be here. For most of his life, his one goal had been to skate on the same ice as Victor Nikiforov. There was never any thought of beating him, of even <em>thinking</em> that he - someone as plain and boring and <em>ordinary</em> as Yuuri - ever could.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are texts on his phone from Yuuko and Minako, telling him that they, and all of Japan, are behind him. He calls his parents, and there\u2019s a lot of screaming from Mari in the background, but the message is the same: they\u2019re all so very proud of him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Celestino drops by for a quick follow-up before the next day, a bolstering pep talk that\u2019s meant to buoy his spirits and keep his eye on the prize.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The din as he exits the hotel the next morning is deafening, reporters shoving their microphones and recorders at him, a million flash bulbs going off at the same time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYuuri!\u201d one yells. \u201cHow does it feel, knowing that all of Japan is watching?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s been strangely calm since waking up this morning, a sense of purpose settled into him. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he demurs, and smiles for the cameras as Celestino ushers him away from the press.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Later, in the locker room, Celestino clasps him by the shoulders.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019ve come so far, Yuuri. You can do this.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri clears his throat. It\u2019d been a cathartic night.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI know,\u201d he responds, and the pleased grin on Celestino\u2019s face is all the boost he needs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the holding room, he makes sure to watch Victor\u2019s performance. It\u2019s technically perfect and presentationally beautiful. His jumps are high, hands posed <em>just</em> so, landings steady and sure. Victor is a star sure of his place in the spotlight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One performance later, it\u2019s his turn.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Yuuri glides out onto the ice and takes his place, the noise of the crowd fades.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He looks up into the stands, the lights bright, and thinks: <em>I was made to be here.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The music starts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s body <em>flows, </em>whirling and soaring with grace. Every move is exact, every muscle tuned and held under his fine control. As he enters the second half, the notes swelling and rising, his jumps are flawlessly balanced, the sweeps of his arms elegance personified. He faintly registers the commentary in the background - <em>And for his final jump, a quadruple toe loop!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He takes the leap, he places all his faith, and -</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He nails the quadruple flip.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As he draws to an end, the paradigm shift is perceptible. The cheers around him welcome and beckon, signalling to everyone: <em>there\u2019s someone new out to make history.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri is poised, chest heaving, arm still outstretched, fingers posed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The crowd roars, surging to their feet, and flowers rain from the stands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rinkside, the commentators go wild, yelling about how unprecedented this was, how remarkable, how game-changing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He breaks the 200-point barrier.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Combined, he breaks 300.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wins the Grand Prix Finals.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Later, when he finally manages to extricate himself from the media and fans, he finds Victor waiting in his hotel room, sitting on the bed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe housekeeping staff recognised me and let me in,\u201d Victor explains, slight smile on his face. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s the first time in five years that Victor hasn\u2019t taken home the gold in the Grand Prix Finals - or, in fact, <em>any</em> gold.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s not - Yuuri wouldn\u2019t call it the end of an era <em>per se</em>, but he\u2019s sure he can give Victor a run for his money in the upcoming years, if this isn\u2019t his last competitive season.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Yuuri says. \u201cCongratulations, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor huffs a laugh. \u201cI should be the one saying that.\u201d He stands, almost leonine, and prowls over to Yuuri, intent dark in his eyes. Not for the first time, he\u2019s struck by how much taller Victor is. \u201cYou were brilliant out there. I\u2019d thought - I\u2019ve gone so long thinking nothing could surprise me. That quad flip - \u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s pushed backed against the door, mouth pressed to his.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s tongue is skilful, teasing and stroking in equal parts, and he can feel himself getting hard. Victor slides a thigh between his legs, and the sudden pressure is glorious against the line of his hardening cock.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They fuck long and slow, round one bleeding into two, then three, and then exhausted sleep for the both of them, a tangle of their bodies on the bed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the light of the morning, soft sunlight dappling in through the windows, the two of them showered and rounds four and five over with, Victor turns to him, expression pensive.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCome with me to Russia.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Perhaps the most surprising thing is that Yuuri doesn\u2019t immediately say no. Instead, he turns away, head bowed in thought.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The thought of Russia eats at him, even as he returns to Detroit and figures out what to do for the two months before his training starts in earnest again.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s won the Grand Prix. He has serious hardware to his name now. There\u2019s next season, sure, but he feels a restlessness in his bones, a yearning to reach for even greater heights.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He feels strangely discontent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri talks to Celestino, then his parents, and then Phichit. All of them are in agreement, even if some are more reluctant than others. He\u2019s entering a new phase of his professional figure skating career, and Russia is a good idea.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Celestino is, of course, loathe to lose his star pupil, but he understands that Yuuri thinks he\u2019s come as far as he can with him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His parents want what\u2019s best for him, and if he thinks that whatever\u2019s best is waiting in Moscow, they\u2019ll support him completely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Minako yells at him over the phone and asks if this is because Victor trains there too, and it\u2019s testament to how much he\u2019s grown that he tells her that it isn\u2019t - at least, not entirely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Phichit just hugs him tightly and tells him he\u2019ll miss him, and not to be an idiot and to stay in touch. They then microwave a shit ton of popcorn and marathon House of Cards on Netflix, the both of them throwing popcorn at the screen when Frank is particularly Machiavellian and making incredulous comments at the ridiculousness of the American political system.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He gets in touch with Yakov, which is something he\u2019s incredibly proud of himself for being able to do without chickening out, because the gruff man terrifies him. Yakov agrees to take him on, and they talk terms and fees, and within days he\u2019s emailed a contract. Yuuri signs off on it and couriers it back, and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s a new phase of his life he\u2019s put in motion with his own two hands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So he packs up his things from his half of the room in Detroit, fitting five years of his life onto three A4 pages of a shipping manifest and twenty-two cardboard boxes bound for Moscow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In a moment of weakness, he sends Victor a text: <em>See you in three weeks.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s no response, but a couple of days after he gets a voicemail from Victor that\u2019s nothing but the background noise of what sounds to be a club, bass thumping and glasses clinking. The message goes on for ten seconds or so without any sound from Victor before it\u2019s cut off.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s disappointed, and it eats at him, but he tells himself not be stupid. What happened after the Grand Prix Finals was an anomaly. They were high on adrenaline and victory and the rush of endorphins. It didn\u2019t <em>mean</em> anything.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They have a going-away party the night before he\u2019s set to depart, and Phichit invites Leo, Guang Hong and Seung-Gil. They get roaringly drunk and chased off the campus quad for being too noisy. Phichit sobs into Yuuri\u2019s favourite Mizuno hoodie and Guang Hong pats him on the back, while Seung-Gil hangs out on the periphery and tries not to die of embarrassment from the sheer ruckus they\u2019re making.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the Detroit Metro Airport, he buys a coffee and a copy of the new Murakami book, forcing himself to ignore the bright and lurid headlines of the gossip magazines. He catches sight of Victor\u2019s silver hair on the cover of one of them, and manages to suppress the urge to pick it up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Just as he\u2019s by the boarding gate to his flight, laptop stowed away in his backpack and phone about to be put on flight safe mode, he receives a text.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s simple enough, and Yuuri has to tell himself not to read too much into it, but it makes his heart skip a beat all the same.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>See you soon,</em> it reads, and there\u2019s secret smile on Yuuri\u2019s face for the duration of the twelve-hour flight.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he lands at Sheremetyevo International Airport, he turns on his mobile to a text from Yakov informing him that he\u2019s sent someone to pick him up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s sweaty and harried from attempting to wrangle his luggage around the crowds when he finally makes it out the arrival lounge, backpack on his shoulders, duffel bag looped around his arm, and large suitcase painstakingly towed along behind him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sea of Cyrillic letters is overwhelming and terrifying - he\u2019d tried brushing up on his Russian, but he\u2019d been so caught up packing and sorting out visas and sending his belongings by sea freight - so he\u2019s left craning his neck and tiptoeing to see if he can spot anyone by the doors bearing a sign that even slightly resembles his name.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s not hard to spot Victor. For one, he\u2019s in the middle of a huge mob of fans, taking photos, smiling, and signing posters and whatever else they thrust at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s not going to admit that he spots his hair first, the unique glint of silver haunting his dreams and catching his eye enough to turn his head.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s pretty sure Yakov would\u2019ve mentioned if Victor\u2019d been sent to pick him up. It\u2019s not the sort of menial task he\u2019d make Victor do, anyway.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Determined to make his way through the throng, he hefts all his bags, secures his grip on his suitcase, and lurches towards what he <em>thinks</em> might be the passenger pick-up area.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He makes it a good hundred feet before Victor somehow spots him, swooping in to relieve him of his suitcase.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYuuri!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cThere you are. I\u2019m glad I spotted you before you vanished, didn\u2019t Yakov tell you he was sending someone?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHe-he did,\u201d Yuuri stammers, caught off guard, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be you, though. You must be busy.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor waves a dismissive hand. \u201cNo, no, the season\u2019s over, so I have some time off before training really picks up again, same as you. Is this all you brought?\u201d He gives Yuuri\u2019s three bags a skeptical eye.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Blushing furiously and unsure why, Yuuri scrambles to explain, \u201cNo, I sent most of it ahead, it\u2019ll be here in a week. These are just my skates and some clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAh, good call,\u201d Victor agrees, nodding, a twinkle in his eye. Yuuri finds himself wondering what has Victor in such a radiant mood.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wary of the awkwardness of silence setting in, Yuuri rushes to ask, \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They draw up to the lift bank that serves the carpark, Victor sending a group of fangirls huddled nearby a charming grin. \u201cEh, mostly just relaxing, spending time with Maccachin,\u201d he replies. The lift arrives, and they pile in along with an elderly lady and her son, who both also get beaming smiles from Victor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor lights up, as if suddenly struck by a thought, and whips his phone out of his coat. \u201cOh! Maccachin - that\u2019s right, you\u2019ve not met him. He\u2019s my poodle, he\u2019s <em>so</em> adorable, you\u2019re going to love him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s no way Yuuri can mention that he knows all about Maccachin without it sounding weird. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he responds, smiling up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved dogs. I had one too.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI want to see your dog! Do you have any photos?\u201d Victor\u2019s far too excited about this, and Yuuri squirms with the knowledge that he <em>can\u2019t</em> show Victor a photo of Vicchan for obvious reasons. There\u2019s little creepier than telling someone you owned a dog nearly identical to theirs and named it after them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The lift <em>dings,</em> and the doors draw open. They trundle out, his three bags less cumbersome when spread between the two of them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo, sorry, I don\u2019t have any photos on my phone,\u201d Yuuri apologises, internally breathing a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Victor reassures, \u201cYou can show me photos next time.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They leave the lift bank and enter the carpark, and Victor\u2019s Aston Martin sticks out like a very sleek, very expensive sore thumb.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHere we go,\u201d Victor says, and loads his baggage into the back, waving Yuuri away when he tries to help.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They depart the airport and slide onto the highway, joining the hundreds of others journeying into Moscow proper. The quiet in the car isn\u2019t <em>awkward,</em> but it\u2019s not entirely comfortable.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fidgeting with the door rest, Yuuri takes in the expensive pair of sunglasses that sit on the dashboard, and the tiny figure of a skater hanging from the rearview mirror.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI think I\u2019ll be rooming in the same complex as Yuri Plisetsky,\u201d he says, finally settling on a topic. \u201cAre you two friends?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYuri?\u201d Victor repeats, laughter in his voice. \u201cSort of, I guess. He\u2019s more like a really annoying younger brother. He\u2019s relatively harmless. Don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From Yuuri\u2019s interaction with Yuri in the locker room, \u2018relatively harmless\u2019 is <em>not</em> how he would choose to describe the youth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAlso, about that - I know Yakov was going to see about settling this, but I thought I\u2019d let you know first - Georgi had a really bad breakup with his girlfriend last week and was kicked out of his flat, so he\u2019s moved into what\u2019s supposed to to be your studio.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh,\u201d Yuuri says, lost, all the doubt at the back of his mind about his move to Russia threatening to rear its ugly head. \u201cI could get a hotel?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor flicks a quick glance at him and clears his throat, and Yuuri could swear he almost looks <em>nervous. </em>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take to sort this out,\u201d he says, \u201cBut if you like, you\u2019re welcome to stay at my place.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s stunned into silence.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not very big,\u201d Victor continues, tone apologetic, \u201cAlthough I do have a sofa that pulls out into a bed, and you\u2019re welcome to that. I just thought it\u2019d be a waste to get something so big when I\u2019m away most of the season and travelling a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it sounds great,\u201d Yuuri hurries to reply, not wanting to sound ungrateful. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re sure it won\u2019t be a huge pain. It\u2019s really fine, though, I can stay at a hotel.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019d rather not, and it\u2019d put a hole in his pocket that he won\u2019t make his parents pay for. His winnings from the competitive season didn\u2019t add up to much, once you took away all his coaching fees, equipment costs, and travel expenses.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNot at all!\u201d Victor reassures. \u201cAnd you can meet Maccachin, I know he\u2019ll love you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The conversation peters off, and Yuuri relaxes into the idea. After that, it\u2019s embarrassing how quickly the monotony of the scenery and movements of a car in motion lull him into sleep.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he wakes, it\u2019s to the gentle weight of a hand on his knee and a warm voice in his ear.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>Kotyenok,</em> we\u2019re here,\u201d Victor says, voice low.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri opens his eyes in bleary blinks, the fluorescent light from the underground garage harsh and unforgiving on his tired eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor unloads all his luggage from the car, once again waving off any attempts by Yuuri to help. He concedes to Yuuri carrying his backpack, but hoists the duffel on his own shoulder and wheels the suitcase along himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s flat may not be huge, but it\u2019s an understatement to say it\u2019s small. The living room is large and airy, the furnishing clearly designer and expensive, and the kitchen appliances are all gleaming and top-of-the-line. Yuuri would know, his family <em>does</em> run a restaurant in the bathhouse.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s clear the neighbourhood\u2019s exclusive and liable to induce no small sense of postcode envy. Victor has a doorman, for crying out loud.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The flat itself is cosy and well-loved, but it doesn\u2019t stop Yuuri from feeling out of place. He\u2019d grown up in a sturdy but aged bathhouse, their furniture all worn but painstakingly restored and cared for. Their clothes were never designer, and while they never wore rags, his parents were always frugal. He\u2019s not used to any of this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The dog that comes bounding out of what he presumes to be the bedroom, however, does help. Tail wagging and tongue lolling, Maccachin takes to him as quickly as Victor\u2019d promised, the easy acceptance going far towards putting Yuuri at ease.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hugging his backpack to his chest, Yuuri ventures towards the sofa. \u201cCan I put my bag here?\u201d he asks, teeth biting uncertainly at his lower lip. The sofa is genuine suede, and there\u2019s a worry that his bag might dirty it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The question seems to spur Victor into motion, jumping to straighten a pile of magazines on a table and bending to scoop a pair of shoes up from their haphazard position on the floor. If Yuuri didn\u2019t find the idea so absurd, he\u2019d say Victor look flustered.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOf course!\u201d he responds, \u201cMake yourself comfortable, I want you to feel at home.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri sets his bag gingerly on the sofa, pulling out his phone to send a quick text to his parents and Phichit to let them know he\u2019s arrived safely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sky is black beyond the full-length windows, the lights of the city glowing softly amber. A glance at the clock on the kitchen wall tells him it\u2019s nearly ten at night.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He asks if he can grab a quick shower, and escapes to the en suite off the master bedroom to rally and gather his thoughts. The water is searing against his back, turning his skin rosy with the heat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s surreal. Two years ago, if you told him that he\u2019d lose his virginity to Victor Nikiforov, win the Grand Prix championship, move to Russia, and then somehow end up invited to live with Victor, he\u2019d have laughed in your face, slapped you for making fun of his dreams, and then probably broken down crying.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He shuts off the water, and steps out of the shower to stand by the bathroom sink. Yuuri studies himself in the mirror as he brushes his teeth, wondering what the hell Victor sees (saw?) in him that made him so desirable. His nose is too flat, his eyes a dull brown, his cheekbones non-existent. He exhales, a resigned puff of breath, and pulls on a comfy shirt and some pyjama pants.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he exits the bathroom, it\u2019s to the sight of Victor reclining on the king bed in the master bedroom, book in hand and held aloft. The low lamplight throws dusty shadows around the room, casting Victor in a gentle, muted glow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s struck by how much he <em>wants.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He must stand there too long for it not to be weird, because Victor looks up, expression concerned.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asks, and Yuuri gulps, nodding furiously and blushing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYes! Sorry, I\u2019m just very tired, and I wasn\u2019t thinking straight, I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel awkward.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I was worried about you for a second. Do you need anything?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo, but thank you. I think I\u2019ll turn in for the night.\u201d Yuuri turns to leave, damp bath towel clutched to his chest. He\u2019s nearly out the door when Victor speaks, something in his tone that Yuuri can\u2019t quite put his finger on.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cMy bed\u2019s big enough for the two of us.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri freezes, shocked into silence. He turns back to face Victor, finding him watching with careful eyes. Sensing his indecision, Victor presses his advantage.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe had fun at the Finals and Troph\u00e9e, didn\u2019t we, Yuuri?\u201d he draws down the duvet and sits up slowly, almost as if he\u2019s wary of startling him. Victor\u2019s voice is husky and ripe with promise. \u201cNow that we\u2019re going to be training together, don\u2019t you think we should get to know each other better?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It takes Yuuri two tries to find his voice again. \u201cI - I don\u2019t want to impose,\u201d he says, and his protest is weak even to his own ears.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u2018Never,\u201d Victor insists.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They don\u2019t fall asleep until past midnight, Victor teasing him with his talented hands and mouth, tongue showering his cock with attention and bringing him to that climactic, final peak. When Yuuri comes, Victor swallows all of it and presses feathery kisses to the skin of his hip, hand stroking gently as he comes down from the high of pleasure. Yuuri tucks a hand between them to find Victor hard and wanting, and teeth set to his lower lip, tries to replicate everything he remembers he likes, deft touches down his long length and teasing swipes of his thumb and just the <em>barest</em> hint of nails. Victor moans loud and low when he comes, catching his mouth in a deep kiss as his does so, murmuring endearments as they rearrange themselves for sleep.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wrapped up in Victor, body lax with release and cocooned in the warmth of a body and the duvet around them, Yuuri falls into asleep like a pebble sinking to the bottom of a placid, cool lake.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the intervening two months before training starts for the new competitive season, they fall into a comfortable routine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri rises first, used to the bathhouse opening hours and early preparation times. He makes himself a cup of green tea, grabs a fruit from the bowl on the kitchen counter, and gets a pot of coffee going.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green tea in hand, he wanders over to the sofa to flip the TV on, usually Russian children\u2019s cartoons, and he follows along, repeating the Russian words as best he can, Japanese-Russian dictionary on the coffee table to look up anything unfamiliar.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By then, it\u2019s usually pushing nine in the morning, and Victor meanders out, yawning and stretching. He pours himself a cup of coffee from the pot that Yuuri\u2019s made, adding far too much sugar and just a splash of milk, and then joins him on the sofa.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They watch cartoons until nine-thirty, Victor helpfully correcting his pronunciation or explaining some Russian cultural reference he doesn\u2019t get, and by then Victor\u2019s hungry and demanding a proper breakfast. He takes them to the local bakery just down the street, dwarfed by the array of trendy shops and run by a sweet elderly couple. They buy a mountain of freshly-baked <em>vatrushka</em> and <em>syrniki</em>, returning to the flat to eat their spoils slathered in jam and cream.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By eleven, Victor\u2019s insisting he <em>has</em> to show Yuuri some attraction or another, so they\u2019re out the door and wandering the Red Square or Kremlin or Gorky Park, Victor taking a million photos like a tourist and making Yuuri pose for a few that all end up on Instagram. Or, if they\u2019re feeling lazy, they skip going out and lounge around at the flat, reading or watch terrible daytime TV with plots Yuuri can\u2019t keep track of, curled up together on the bed or sofa. (He doesn\u2019t tell Victor, but he thinks <em>those</em> are the best days.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dinner\u2019s usually around six or seven, and for all his shiny kitchen appliances, Victor can\u2019t actually cook for shit, so Yuuri will throw something together, or they\u2019ll head to the myriad of cafes in their neighbourhood, or if they\u2019re <em>really</em> lazy, they\u2019ll order in.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a special treat a week after he arrives, Yuuri tries his hand at replicating his family\u2019s famous <em>katsudon,</em> and it goes so well that Victor\u2019s swooning and exclaiming <em>vkusno!</em> with every bite.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They\u2019ll take Maccachin for his evening walk, and by the time they return it\u2019s nearly ten and Yuuri will begin winding down for bed, and most nights Victor will sidle up behind him, breath hot on his ear, and suggest they do <em>something else</em> instead.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s all terrifyingly domestic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s not that Yuuri <em>minds,</em> it\u2019s that he\u2019s certain that this play at domesticity won\u2019t last, and Victor will soon return to his fast and dazzling lifestyle in the limelight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So he clings to it as hard as he can and ignores the voice at the back of his mind whispering that hope is for fools, and when Victor fucks him at night he gives himself over completely, throwing himself into the pleasure with abandon.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If anything, it\u2019s a consolation that the sex never stops being mind-blowing.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He first runs into Yuri Plisetsky again a week before their training is due to begin. He\u2019s wandering around the rink, familiarising himself with the place, when he spots Yuri lacing up his skates on one of the benches.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s wandered off to chat with some of the skaters he spotted on their way in, so Yuuri\u2019s been left to his own devices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Summoning up his courage, and determined mend bridges now that they\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of each other, he takes a deep breath and approaches him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHi,\u201d he greets, the nervousness slightly colouring his tone. \u201cYuri Plisetsky, right? I think we got off on the wrong foot back in Marseille, so I wanted to reintroduce myself.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuri looks up, expression partially concealed by his hood and fringe. \u201cWhat are you playing at?\u201d he asks, tone hostile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Yuuri sputters, taken aback.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cVictor may be too far gone, but I\u2019m not an idiot. Fucking him isn\u2019t going to make <em>you</em> a better skater, you know.\u201d His voice is snide, words vicious.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>Yuri, hvatit,\u201d </em>Victor snaps, drawing up behind them, voice raised.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s hands are trembling, and he laces them together to steady himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Yuuri says, trying to intervene to diffuse the situation. \u201cLet\u2019s just go. Can we head back now?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuri\u2019s eyes widen, and his expression grows even stormier. \u201cYou\u2019re <em>living</em> with him?\u201d he bites out, tone incredulous, gaze hard on Victor.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s a heated exchange between them in Russian, too fast for Yuuri to follow or catch, and it ends with Yuri fuming, throwing his hands up in defeat, and stomping off.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor takes his hands, gently unfurling them from where they\u2019re tightly clenched together. Lacing their fingers together, he leads them out of the rink to the car.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to see that,\u201d he sighs at length. \u201cYuri can be - he cares, in his own way, even about affairs that don\u2019t concern him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri tries for a smile. \u201cYuuko\u2019s a little like that, too. When she interferes, that\u2019s how I know she\u2019s looking out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At Victor\u2019s look of relief, he continues, growing bold. \u201cI get it. I know Yuri means well. I just don\u2019t understand why he dislikes me so much.\u201d Flicking a glance at Victor yields little information, his expression shuttered.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Victor says, and the reassuring beam he directs Yuuri\u2019s way isn\u2019t as convincing as he thinks it is.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s not a sense of\u00a0<em>foreboding,</em> exactly, that churns low in his gut, but it\u2019s something dangerously close.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri tries his best to follow the light chatter Victor peppers their ride back to the flat with, but his heart isn\u2019t in it, and in that moment, hurtling along a Moscow motorway, the sky creeping into dark, he thinks he\u2019s never felt so lost.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Training begins challenging and demanding, the pace Yakov sets barely letting up by the time the third week rolls around.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He has a morning run at eight, skating practice from eight-thirty, ballet with Madam Baranovskaya after lunch, and gym from four in the afternoon - six days a week, Monday through to Saturday. It\u2019s a brutal regime that has him stumbling back to the flat most evenings feeling like he\u2019s just gone rounds with a raging bull and lost.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri makes a few friends in the scant breaks in his intensive training regime. Georgi Popovich mostly hangs around the rink, alternating between being dramatically heartbroken and vowing to have his revenge on his ex, but Mila Babicheva takes an instant liking to him and pretty much adopts him, despite Yuuri being five years her senior.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Their busy schedules keep Yuuri and Victor apart most days, only skating together when Yakov calls for it, and the distance between them - and daily banality of living together - begin to take its toll.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s barely noticeable at first, just small things that niggle at Yuuri, like the way Victor leaves his coffee mugs all over the place once he\u2019s done drinking, mugs half-full with days-old coffee sometimes revealing themselves under the sofa, on random shelves, or once, in the bathroom. And Yuuri, for all his neatness and attempt to keep himself as contained as possible, still living out of his bags and suitcase, twenty-two boxes of his belongings safely stored in a facility somewhere, can\u2019t always keep up with Victor\u2019s quirks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor, for example, can\u2019t stand it when food in the fridge isn\u2019t arranged <em>just</em> so, and the first time he snaps at Yuuri for placing the butter on the wrong shelf, it\u2019s in March, five weeks since training began.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri apologises, of course, and resolves to be more careful, but the cracks are appearing faster than he anticipated, and when he offers to make his <em>katsudon</em> for dinner one Saturday night and Victor turns him down, saying he\u2019s going out with some friends, Yuuri can only nod mutely and think, <em>I thought I had more time.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When Victor staggers back to the flat at four in the morning, he reeks of alcohol and general club funk. Unsteady on his feet, Yuuri has to loop a hand over his shoulder to guide him, the two of them shuffling awkwardly to the bedroom.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tugging off his shoes and jeans, knowing that Victor hates to sleep in restrictive clothing, Yuuri\u2019s about to turn the light off when Victor turns, cheek pressed onto the pillow, to look at him with lidded eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cChristophe?\u201d he says, voice slurred, words blurring together. Yuuri freezes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Blood turned to ice in his veins, Yuuri can\u2019t stop his heart from pounding, the rush of blood loud in his ears. He pulls away from the bed to sit on the sofa, hands balled into fists on his lap.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>It\u2019s nothing</em>, he tells himself. <em>It could mean a million different things.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s a sombre reminder that he\u2019s not beautiful or gorgeous or naturally charismatic like the multitude of people who\u2019ve captured and held Victor\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019s just plain. Plain, anxious, introverted, boring Katsuki Yuuri.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He refuses to cry.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It takes Yuuri another week to muster the courage to move out of Victor\u2019s flat, Georgi finally waking up from his fugue state to get a new flat and move out of Yuuri\u2019s intended studio.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor disappears to parts unknown on the morning of his move, expression stony, and Mila stops by to give Yuuri a lift to his new place so he won\u2019t have to catch a cab.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s not much by way of belongings to move, given that his twenty-two boxes will be delivered the next day, so once Yuuri stows away all the clothes and toiletries from his suitcase, duffel, and backpack, Mila whips out a bottle of vodka and insists it\u2019s Russian tradition to drink in honour of a new flat. She reminds him so much of Minako sometimes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He\u2019d usually refuse, but Yuuri\u2019s heartsore and broken and figures it can\u2019t hurt things.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They\u2019re halfway through the bottle, Yuuri beyond tipsy and Mila looking none the worse for wear, when she brings it up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSoooo,\u201d she begins, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pry, but Yuri mentioned you and Victor have a thing, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if this sudden move is related to that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri sighs loudly, drunkenly waving a hand around. \u201cVictor\u2019s stupid,\u201d he declares, \u201cAnd everything sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She takes it as admission, and wriggles closer to hug him, patting him on the back. \u201cMen are stupid,\u201d she agrees, nodding sagely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHey!\u201d he whines, and then, in a haze of inebriated reason, nods along. \u201cThey really are.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs that why you broke up with Victor?\u201d she asks, voice gentle.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>I </em> didn\u2019t break up with him,\u201d he corrects, tone petulant. Struck by a thought, he whips around to face her, overbalancing and nearly face planting on the floor. \u201cIs <em>that</em> what he\u2019s been telling people about why I left?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Voice modulated to be careful, she says, \u201cWell, <em>you</em> were the one who moved out. It does look that way.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>Ugh,\u201d</em> Yuuri huffs, indignant. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, finger jabbing into the air in emphasis, \u201cHe was the one who - who <em>did</em> this, with his supermodels and perfect everything and <em>Christophe</em> and my <em>katsudon. </em>He never wanted to <em>date</em> me, we went to <em>Bon</em>.<em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It sounded way more eloquent in his head.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mila parses the ramble of information, nodding slowly along. After several seconds, she clears her throat and prods him into an upright position. \u201cNow, you\u2019re going to listen to me, and I know you\u2019re not sober right now, but you\u2019re going to remember this or I will kick your butt, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri querulously agrees, hugging his knees to his chest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cRight,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019ve trained with Victor since I was fourteen, and in the four years I\u2019ve known him I\u2019ve never seen him act the way he does with you. He\u2019s never let anyone move in, never <em>wanted</em> anyone to move in, and whatever happened never, ever ended up at his place. I don\u2019t know him as well as Yuri does, but it\u2019s no secret that Victor\u2019s a selfish person, even if he doesn\u2019t mean to be.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mila hugs him tightly, and he\u2019s so incredibly grateful to have her with him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI know how you feel totally sucks right now, but I\u2019m on your side. You don\u2019t need Victor to achieve great things.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His smile is tremulous and shaky through the tears, and Mila lets him cry on her shoulder, only leaving when he promises to text her the next day.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As she leaves, she makes sure he gets to bed alright and places two aspirin and a glass of water on the bedside table, shutting the light off as she goes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers, right before she gets to the door, and she turns to give him a soft smile before she\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Curled under the duvet in another unfamiliar room, he tries to ignore all thoughts of Victor, and of how foolish he was to think he could meet him on the same playing field.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When he finally manages to fall asleep, his dreams are unsettling and hazy, and he can\u2019t recall any of it in the morning.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By seven in the evening, the rink is deserted, leaving Yuuri alone to skate slow, lazy laps on the ice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His talk with Mila weighs on his mind, her words clear even through the fog of alcohol and tears: <em>I\u2019ve never seen him act the way he does with you.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He does a few jumps, a triple Lutz-triple flip combination, and then a quad toe-double toe. He lands them all, but it doesn\u2019t give him the sense of satisfaction it normally does, his thoughts heavy and troubled.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mila finds him just as he nails a quad flip, and he skates to a stop as she draws up to him on the edge of the rink.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She claps at his landing, letting out a low whistle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you do that on TV, but it\u2019s far more impressive in person,\u201d she compliments. Hand shifting to her cocked hip, eerily reminiscent of Yuuko when she\u2019s chiding, Mila frowns. \u201cDon\u2019t just disappear like that. I was getting worried.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri blushes and apologises, chastened.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With her arrival, he\u2019s struck by a sudden thought. \u201cMila,\u201d he says, \u201cThere\u2019s something I was working on back in Detroit before I moved here, would you like to - can you - \u201d he stops, at a loss for words.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s best if you just watched, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mila nods, curious, and Yuuri glides back to the centre of the ice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The music starts loud in his mind, the drifting notes plaintive and true. He slides into the steps, echoing and trailing Victor in his mind\u2019s eye.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The melody rises and falls, and he soars and leaps and chases after him, every step lifted from his mind and rendered to reality through the medium of <em>Yuuri</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor\u2019s jumps, glides, landings - even the arch of his fingers and curve of his arms - are perfectly replicated with his body.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When it ends, the crescendo and notes of the music linger plangent and ringing in his ears, the rink silent but for his heaving breaths.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mila has a hand pressed to her mouth, the other holding up her mobile, camera aimed at him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYuuri,\u201d she whispers, awed. \u201cThat was <em>beautiful.\u201d</em> She beckons him towards her, and he complies, the sound of his skates loud as he slides over to where she\u2019s standing. Mila holds up her phone, pressing the playback button on the video. \u201cLook. Your routine - everything - was flawless. I don\u2019t think Victor could\u2019ve performed a better skate of <em>Stay Close to Me</em> himself.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unsure how to deal with the praise, Yuuri ducks his head and rubs at the nape of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I was doing in my spare time,\u201d he says, downplaying it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She holds her phone up, the recording of him continuing to play on the small screen. \u201cCan I post this online? People will love it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Figuring it won\u2019t garner much attention, Yuuri shrugs, and says, \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He heads back to his studio, and runs into Yuri on the stairwell.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s a relief that all he gets is a glare and <em>get out of the way, loser,</em> and when he showers that night, under the scalding hot spray, he can\u2019t stop seeing Victor performing <em>Stay Close to Me </em>in his head, his body commanding and graceful and every inch the consummate, perfect figure skater.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri awakens to persistent knocking on his door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Scrambling for his glasses, he shoves them on and rushes to get it open, taking a disorientated step back when he sees Victor just outside his tiny studio, looking as dishevelled as he\u2019s ever seen him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor says, voice hoarse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I had to come to see you as soon as I saw the video. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Confused, only half-awake, and too undressed for this conversation, Yuuri gestures him into his flat, shutting the door behind him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat video?\u201d he asks, rubbing at his drowsy eyes and grabbing for a hoodie to pull over his ratty t-shirt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis!\u201d Victor exclaims, brandishing his mobile, and Yuuri spots the tiny figure of himself onscreen, gliding to the Victor\u2019s steps of <em>Stay Close to Me. </em>The music playing over the recording must\u2019ve been added by Mila.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Overnight, the view count has jumped to over six million.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh my god,\u201d Yuuri says, dumbfounded.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Coming close, almost toe\u00a0to toe, Victor\u2019s hand comes up to tuck under his chin, nudging it up to meet his gaze. When he speaks, his breath ghosts minty fresh.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTell me you <em>felt</em> every second of that performance.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Still reeling and shaken, pulse rabbiting, Yuuri can\u2019t hold his gaze, not when Victor\u2019s looking him like that. He glances away, and Victor makes a frustrated sound, hand applying more pressure to bring Yuuri\u2019s eyes back to his.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhy would you say something like that?\u201d Yuuri asks, distraught. \u201cIs this a test? Are you trying to test me?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>Tell me,\u201d</em> Victor repeats, voice riding the edge of dangerous.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Yuuri says, trying to step away. Victor steps after him, face alight with an emotion Yuuri can\u2019t name.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c<em>Don\u2019t</em> run away from me now, not again,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a year and half of you being distant and skittish, I deserve a straight answer.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bewildered by the confession and turn of events, Yuuri smacks his hand away. \u201c<em>I\u2019ve</em> been running away? You\u2019re the one with the - \u201d he waves his hand at Victor, \u201c - the fast car, and the designer flat, and the celebrity exes, and the fancy restaurants.\u201d He gestures at himself. \u201cI\u2019m just <em>me,</em> don\u2019t you see? <em>You</em> were the one who kept leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor runs a frustrated hand through his hair. He turns away from Yuuri, mouth opening, the closing, then opening again. Yuuri's\u00a0never seen the man at a loss for a smooth line, a press-friendly quip. He whirls back to Yuuri, eyes alight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOnly because you never ask me to <em>stay!\u201d</em> Victor jabs a finger at the door. \u201cYou think any of that <em>matters</em> to me? I\u2019ve spent over a year trying to make you see that I think you\u2019re special. I think you\u2019re <em>perfect.\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A hot tear runs down his face, and Yuuri angrily brushes it away with the back of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to change - I never - I want you to stay who you are. If I seemed distant, or if I ignored you - I didn\u2019t want you to see my shortcomings.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor comes up to him, hands cupping his face. He brushes away Yuuri\u2019s tears with his thumb, expression softened. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out. Open up to me, <em>hold</em> on to me, and I promise I\u2019ll meet you where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri\u2019s hand comes up to rest over Victor\u2019s own, and he smiles through the haze of his tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve - This is all so stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Swooping down to catch his lips in a devastating kiss, Victor pulls back just enough to say, \u201cNo, <em>tigryenok,</em> this is what love is.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Stunned, Yuuri blinks up at him, wide-eyed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks, voice quivery.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ve never been surer,\u201d Victor answers, and presses their lips together, warm and firm and <em>right.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">_____</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Victor goes on to compete in his final competitive season, ending with gold medals in\u00a0the World Championships, the European Championships, the Olympics, <em>and</em> the Grand Prix Finals. He blazes through records, personal and world, and drives the media wild. When he announces his retirement from professional figure skating, he simultaneously announces that he will begin a career a coaching, starting by taking on Katsuki Yuuri.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yuuri retires three years after Victor does, two more Grand Prix gold medals to his name and numerous titles in the World and Four Continents Championships\u00a0under his belt. Between the two of them, they have more medals than they know what to do with.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They have a small civil ceremony on a beach in Hawaii, and they honeymoon in Japan, stopping by Yu-topia so Victor can try the original Katsuki <em>katsudon</em> for himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Their life isn\u2019t <em>perfect,</em> not by a long shot, but it\u2019s wonderful and happy and they\u2019re both in love, and they\u2019re both doing what they do best: staying close to each other.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<em>Fin.</em>\n</p>"
