  "text": "<p>It was right there, taunting him, tempting him into picking it up if only for the convenience of the location.<br>\n<br>\nBucky had watched Sam open his phone a billion times. He could have swiped in the right direction of the security code with his eyes closed and the phone behind his back. His own phone was so far away. He\u2019d have to make an effort to get it and there were at least twenty steps from Sam\u2019s bathroom to the front hallway where Bucky\u2019s jacket was, and for some reason Sam kept his phone charger next to his electric razor charger.<br>\n<br>\nConvenient. Location.<br>\n<br>\nIt wasn\u2019t like Bucky was going to use Sam\u2019s phone for nefarious means. He just needed to text Natasha for a second opinion. He\u2019d felt confident when he left his apartment less than an hour ago, but Sam\u2019s bathroom mirror was showing a slightly varied reflection than his own, maybe because the counter was shorter or the mirror was taller, or the lights were harsher, or <em>something</em>. Whatever it was, Bucky was looking at himself in it and frowning.<br>\n<br>\nNat would know if these jeans were too One Direction for him to pull off.<br>\n<br>\nNay, they might be worse than One Direction. They might be Jonas Brothers circa two thousand and whatever the fuck year the Jonas Brothers were big in.<br>\n<br>\nBucky squinted and stared at his thighs. God, maybe he should skip thigh day at the gym sometimes. He wasn\u2019t used to actually being able to see anything bulging in that general area, unless is was up a few inches and a bit more centralized. Skinny jeans always looked <em>fantastic</em> on him.<br>\n<br>\nMaybe he should have stuck to black instead of trying different colours.<br>\n<br>\nEspecially bright red.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Bright red.</em> What was he thinking?? He was a side-seam away from appearing like some kind of superhero in tights.<br>\n<br>\nNat didn\u2019t answer his text. More specifically, Nat ignored the text from Sam that was actually from him, which either meant she had nothing good to say about the pants and wanted him to wear them anyway, or she wasn\u2019t close to her phone.<br>\n<br>\nBucky panicked slightly and looked at Sam\u2019s most recent text list.<br>\n<br>\nThe person beneath Nat on Sam\u2019s friend list was Steve. Bucky had never met Steve, though he\u2019d heard about him a few times, and he thought that Sam might have a reason to keep his friend groups separate \u2013 like maybe when he needed to catch a quiet moment, he\u2019d have Steve.<br>\n<br>\nBucky would resent that if he wasn\u2019t halfway through attaching a selfie to the end of the string of messages between Sam and this Steve person. That wasn\u2019t exactly making his case as a responsible individual.<br>\n<br>\nSteve. <em>Steve.</em><br>\n<br>\nThe name alone was enough to make Bucky assume that he was a member of Sam\u2019s grown up friend group. With a name like Steve he was probably born a responsible adult. The kind of person with 401Ks and mortgages, and no problems paying both. Bucky couldn\u2019t even afford to make minimum payments on his credit card this month, especially not after treating himself to the jeans he was currently obsessing over. They\u2019d seemed like such a great idea in the store.<br>\n<br>\nSteve was probably the kind of person who wouldn\u2019t grab his friend\u2019s phone and start texting strangers to find out if a pair of jeans made his thigh muscles look like ham hocks.<br>\n<br>\nWell, Bucky loved nothing more than horrifying uptight people.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Hey friend of Sam\u2019s can I get an opinion on this outfit?</em> Bucky texted, attaching the selfie taken in Sam\u2019s bathroom mirror.<br>\n<br>\nHe received an answer almost immediately. Bucky was almost expecting a lecture, or at least a concerned question about who had stolen Sam\u2019s phone.<br>\n<br>\nHe got neither.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>New text from Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>What do you want it to say?</em><br>\n<br>\nWell then. Bucky immediately reassessed this Steve person. If he was willing to play along with Bucky, then Bucky was going to use that to get what he wanted.<br>\n<br>\n<em>I\u2019m young enough to wear these pants but old enough to know how to blow your mind at sex. General \u2018your\u2019. Not you specifically.</em><br>\n<br>\nThe answering selfie was of a guy giving him a thumbs up. Bucky hadn\u2019t known that selfies could be that sarcastic without there being a single word attached to the message. It was kind of impressive, so impressive that the second thing Bucky realized was that the man was really attractive. Like, really cataclysmically attractive.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Aww hell Steve you sure know how to reassure a guy, </em>Bucky texted back.<br>\n<br>\n<em>I\u2019d do you,</em> Steve answered, but now that Bucky had seen the expression on Steve\u2019s face, he read the text in an equally deadpanned and unimpressed tone.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d he said to his reflection in the mirror. \u201cIf you can pull off leather, you can pull off red skinnies,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cYou are not a Jonas Brother. You are a hot and young and adventurous enough to try new things.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou do not have a promise ring.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cAre you talking to yourself in there?\u201d Sam asked, rapping on the door with his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go. Can you grab my phone, <em>Mr. Hot, Young and Adventurous</em>? Whenever you\u2019re done staring at yourself, that is.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky rolled his eyes and watched his reflection look equally as unimpressed and sarcastic as the selfie Steve had sent him. He should have known better than to think Sam could make friends who didn\u2019t have some brand of acerbic wit.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cAre you really wearing those pants?\u201d Sam asked, giving him the eyebrows of judgement.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSteve thinks they\u2019re fine,\u201d Bucky responded, tossing Sam his phone.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cOh,\u201d Sam answered sarcastically, rolling his eyes. \u201cWell, if Steve thinks they\u2019re fine.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cAw hell no,\u201d Sam exclaimed halfway through the evening. The two of them were standing on opposite sides of the chrome bar table, and Bucky had both his elbows braced on the top as he played Nerf Hoops on his phone and tried not to allow anyone to see his game choice. \u201cYou actually texted Steve.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI said I did,\u201d Bucky pointed out, completely unconcerned. His pants were completely wasted on this place. His ass was practically on display and not a single person had approached him because of it. Bucky wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to pick someone up, his stance more of a by-product of his boredom than a deliberate choice, but it was pretty telling that a place was lame if there wasn\u2019t at least one person watching him from across the room.<br>\n<br>\nThese pants? Wasted.<br>\n<br>\nBucky? Not wasted enough to deal with this.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d Sam said, showing Bucky his phone.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>How do I know this is actually Sam?</em><br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>I\u2019m not telling a stranger how to get into <u>La porte vert</u></em><u>.</u><br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>No pic no proof.</em><br>\n<br>\nBucky was so delighted he almost dropped his phone on the table. \u201cDoes Steve know you can\u2019t take a selfie until 2016?\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam answered miserably. \u201cHe\u2019s been trying to make me lose the bet ever since.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky totally liked this Steve guy.<br>\n<br>\nSam continued, \u201cSteve\u2019s an asshole. I don\u2019t know why you look so pleased with yourself, he was our IN to better places.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nLa porte vert wasn\u2019t necessarily a better place, but it was new and hot and gaining traction in certain Brooklyn circles. Bucky had first heard of it the week before, and it was vaguely impressive that Steve knew how to find it before Bucky. He was definitely curious about a lot of Steve related things, but his most pressing concern was making the most out of his night out. Bucky let Sam stare miserably at his phone for a few moments. \u201cYou could just call him,\u201d he pointed out, the need to go somewhere that didn\u2019t end with him draining his phone battery playing app games pressed as a greater need than tipping Sam over the edge of losing his bet.<br>\n<br>\n<em>\u201cI could call him,\u201d</em> Sam repeated, sounding far more enthusiastic than the suggestion warranted. Damn. Sam had probably been really close to caving on taking a selfie. Nat wasn\u2019t going to be happy with him if she found out that Bucky was the reason that Sam was still in the running for their bet/New Year\u2019s pact.<br>\n<br>\nSam dialed, pressing the phone to one ear and blocking the other with a finger.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cMe, that\u2019s who!\u201d Sam said into the phone. \u201cI call people! Deal with it.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky could only imagine that Steve had picked up the phone and immediately gave Sam grief for making a phone call. No one made phone calls these days.<br>\n<br>\nBucky was liking Steve more and more.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an asshat,\u201d Sam then said. For a moment Bucky thought it was directed at him for smiling at the one sided convo. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou know it\u2019s me. You recognize my voice.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe him, Steve!\u201d Bucky yelled, leaning across the table towards the phone. \u201cThis could be a body snatching scenario.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSam gave him the dirtiest look he\u2019d ever directed at Bucky. It was kind of awesome, because Sam was typically cool and collect. The last time Bucky had seen that expression on his face, Bucky had accidentally stepped on his airplane model of an F-16 and broke the wing part. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s Bucky.\u201d Sam\u2019s face then morphed from anger to one of frozen misery as he stared at Bucky. \u201cSame guy, but please don\u2019t ever call him that again.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bucky asked curiously. \u201cWhat did he call me? STEVE! WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m not sending you a selfie! You should be on my side. Both of you suck.\u201d Sam ended the call and stared at Bucky for a moment. \u201cI hate you, you know.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky allowed Sam to stew in his misery for a moment, but not too long because if Steve had the key to somewhere less lame than this, Bucky was going to try to unlock it. It was pretty bad that Sam was even able to hold a conversation on his phone in the middle of the club. Sam shouldn\u2019t even be able to feel his phone vibrate, let alone talk to someone on it. \u201cHold up your phone so Steve can see it,\u201d he finally told Sam, opening up his picture app. \u201cIt\u2019s not a selfie if I take it.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSo long as you were the one to suggest it,\u201d Sam answered, which told Bucky that he\u2019d already considered the possibility, but it went against one of Nat\u2019s rules in the bet. Bucky was actually kind of bored these days without Sam\u2019s selfies and Nat\u2019s emojis, but he was betting it would take a few more months before the whole bet collapsed on itself. He could probably last a few months.<br>\n<br>\nPossibly sooner, if Sam ever gave in. Nat wasn\u2019t the one who was going to slip up.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously, who made a bet that lasted a full year? Nat and Sam, that\u2019s who. Ridiculously stubborn, evil people.<br>\n<br>\nBucky snapped a picture of Sam. \u201cWhat\u2019s Steve\u2019s number?\u201d he asked, copying it from Sam\u2019s phone and attaching the picture to the text.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Thanks, Sex Pants,</em> Steve answered.<br>\n<br>\nBucky found himself laughing. \u201cSex Pants,\u201d he said out loud, completely delighted.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Sam held up his hand. \u201cJust don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSteve\u2019s next text was an address and instructions on how to knock on the door. <em>The thing about <u>La porte vert</u> is the door is purple</em>, Steve texted. Immediately afterwards he added: <em><u>La porte vert</u> also is not a gateway to other green things, like environmental consciousness or marijuana.</em><br>\n<br>\n<em>So it\u2019s just another bar with a door themed gimmick that gains flash popularity?</em> Bucky questioned.<br>\n<br>\n<em>I suspect it\u2019ll disappear in three months and reappear in the fall as <u>La porta viola</u> and have an orange door. No one will remember that it\u2019s the same location as <u>La porte vert</u> and we will all spend months searching for a purple door only to ultimately be let down.</em><br>\n<br>\nWho the hell was this guy? And why hadn\u2019t Sam introduced them already? That kind of caustic outlook was exactly the type of thing Bucky responded to, and Steve seemed to be thinking in the same way Bucky did. <em>Welcome to Brooklyn</em>, Bucky finished with, grinning down at his phone as he retrieved his jacket from the coat check.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nFor some reason, Bucky just assumed that he and Sam would be meeting Steve at La porte vert, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case as they slid into an empty booth. Five minutes later, Natasha sat next to Bucky. \u201cIt took you boys long enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m done here.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhy do we fall for this every time?\u201d Bucky questioned, looking around the bar. It was a laid back environment, a mash-up of speakeasy themes, old New York charm, with a modern techno beat and refinished wooden dance floor that had more than one encroaching table so they could fit as many people into the room as possible. It was analogous to almost every other bar in the area, only less established into a single theme. Bucky knew where to get the best drinks, the strongest drinks, the most authentic experience, the least authentic experience, and all within a subway stop or two. Walking distance, really, if it wasn\u2019t the beginning of January and so cold he was sure his legs were the same color as his pants if he spent more than a minute outside.<br>\n<br>\nSam\u2019s allowed his head to fall against the wooden table top. \u201cIt used to be fun.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cPeople used to be more creative,\u201d Bucky complained.<br>\n<br>\nNatasha observed both of them. \u201cThey were never more creative, you were just younger and more impressionable to the novelty of secrecy.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m not old,\u201d Bucky whined. \u201cLook at my pants. These do not say old.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nNatasha gave him a deadpanned, sarcastic expression, her face almost entirely blank but her eyes saying she was passing judgement on him and his pants.<br>\n<br>\nYeah. No one did that expression as well as Natasha did.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nBucky probably should have deleted Steve\u2019s number from his phone.<br>\n<br>\nHe didn\u2019t.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nHis relationship with Steve was a bit strange. Unconventional.<br>\n<br>\nBucky was mostly convinced they were flirting, even if they knew nothing about each other.<br>\n<br>\nMostly, he thought that they should both just get Snapchat. That was pretty much exactly what they were doing: sending each other pictures, some text. But they weren\u2019t actually talking to each other, unless Bucky really ascribed to the \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words\u2019 idiom, and he didn\u2019t. What was worth a thousand words was the fact that Steve\u2019s pictures didn\u2019t just disappear, and Bucky sometimes spent a few minutes looking at them and sussing out details about Steve from the background.<br>\n<br>\nFor a while, he thought that Steve was in another city and that was why Sam had never introduced them, but there was a picture of him with Brooklyn Bridge in the background, his face giving commentary on the people behind him who seemed to be doing yoga in the park during the start of the snowstorm.<br>\n<br>\nIt was the same expression Steve had given him about the pants.<br>\n<br>\nBucky responded with a picture of himself on the subway, showing the way he was standing during the busy rush hour crowd, his hand resting on the railing by his head. His face was discontent, but it was caused by people in general rather than something specific.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Yeah, I hate that</em>, Steve responded.<br>\n<br>\nBucky sent Steve a picture of his favourite coffee shop and a few moments later Steve sent back a picture of a disposable cup with the same logo on it. There were only three locations in and around Brooklyn, so even if it wasn\u2019t from the same caf\u00e9 Bucky was standing in, it was still local enough that it felt like Steve was within reach.<br>\n<br>\nReally, there was no excuse to why the two of them hadn\u2019t met yet.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSteve says to remind you that the pizza place you treat yourself to and horde away in secret after your monthly basketball game had five cases of food poisoning last week.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSam waved Bucky aside. \u201cTell Steve I do what I want.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky gave Sam an unimpressed expression. \u201cYou can tell him yourself.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhy? You seem to text him more than I do.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever introduced us?\u201d Bucky finally caved, simultaneously feeling ridiculous for asking and indignant that Sam\u2019s circle of friends seemed to be a venn diagram with Sam in the middle, and the Steve circle and the Bucky circle weren\u2019t overlapping.<br>\n<br>\nSam frowned at him. \u201cYou two haven\u2019t met yet? Man, all I hear from you is Steve this, Steve that. I thought for sure the two of you had pulled your heads out of your asses and met up.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou know him!\u201d Bucky pointed out. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you introduce us before, then?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSam just shrugged. \u201cNever really thought about the fact you didn\u2019t know each other. Do you actually want me to?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nYes. Yes, Bucky wanted him to. He also kind of wanted to throttle Sam and demand to know if Steve had ever asked to meet him. Did Steve talk about him? Did all Sam hear from Steve was Bucky this, Bucky that?<br>\n<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not important,\u201d Bucky shrugged, playing it as cool as possible. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen sometime.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSee, that right there is a blatant lie. The two of you need to get your shit together on your own. I don\u2019t want to be the intermediary\u2026 that sounds awkward as all hell. Do you really want me to invite both of you for coffee and then sit there as you discover the joys of flirting with each other in person? That sounds like the worst waste of my time. Just get yourself together and ask him yourself.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDo you think Steve liiiikes me?\u201d Bucky whined, just to be an asshole and watch the way Sam threw up his hands and stalked away.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nIt was foolish, but he was just tipsy enough to be riding a high between feeling completely sober and just a little looser than usual, and his hand was on his cock when Steve\u2019s message came in. It was a picture of a beer, Steve\u2019s fingers loosely encircling the neck, and Bucky couldn\u2019t see it as anything other than an innuendo. He knew he shouldn\u2019t do it, that it was gross at best, and invasive at worst, but it felt good to take a picture of his hand reaching beneath his pants, his legs splayed wide and the obvious shape of his erection standing stark against the thin material of his pajama bottoms.<br>\n<br>\nIt took a while before Steve answered, long enough that Bucky had stopped moving his hand along his cock and was now actively concerned that he\u2019d overstepped. It was impossible to feel good with that kind of worry invading his brain, and he was sitting up and hunched over his phone, trying to compose an apology when Steve responded.<br>\n<br>\nSteve sent back a picture of his lap. He was very clearly out in public, and very clearly hard against the front of his jeans. <em>Menace,</em> the text said.<br>\n<br>\n<em>If I was really a menace, I\u2019d take a picture of myself NOW,</em> Bucky answered in return, flopping back on his bed. He was prepared to keep flirting with Steve, even while masturbating.<br>\n<br>\nBucky had a lot of practice with one handed texting.<br>\n<br>\nDon\u2019t tell his friends.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Why don\u2019t you? You\u2019ve already made me hard in public,</em> Steve answered. <em>Make me have to get up to finish in the bathroom.</em><br>\n<br>\nWell then.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cIntroduce me to Steve,\u201d Bucky said, not even bothering to greet Sam. \u201cOr I\u2019ll start oversharing the details of our sexting.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSteve wouldn\u2019t sext,\u201d Sam scoffed. \u201cSteve doesn\u2019t even know what that is.\u201d He paused for a moment, his face taking on this expression of regret. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know about your sexting. Look, I invite Steve out with us sometimes. He doesn\u2019t usually say yes, and the few times he has, he said no at the last minute.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSam shrugged. \u201cI like the guy, but I don\u2019t know much about him. He has a government job, so maybe that. It\u2019s not like we do things together outside of exercising and he doesn\u2019t jog around the park so much as he runs like he\u2019s being chased by his job, so maybe he is.\u201d Sam just shook his head and shrugged like he was entirely disinterested in why Steve hadn\u2019t ended up out with them, though Bucky knew better. If he and Steve texted as often as it looked like they did, then Sam definitely had thought about it and wondered.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s a spy?\u201d Bucky questioned, just to be a little shit. Sam was adamant that Nat\u2019s job managing a copy store was code for something else. He said, quote: have you heard her walk up behind you? No! That\u2019s not because she\u2019s concerned about people shoplifting paper.</p>\n<p>Bucky had his own New Year\u2019s pact. He was going to get to the bottom of Nat\u2019s job if it killed him. He\u2019d already tried to prove she worked in a copy store the year before and ended up going to every single one of them within travelling distance of her apartment with no luck, but he was convinced that Sam\u2019s theory was wrong.</p>\n<p>Nat as a spy? Ahahahahah ha ha ha</p>\n<p>Ha.</p>\n<p>(Wow he supremely hoped not).<br>\n<br>\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sam answered with the type of honest \u2018who me? Why would I think that?\u2019 indignancy that told Bucky he was lying. Sam had definitely thought about it.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWow, ok,\u201d Bucky answered, laughing. There was no way Steve was a spy and still managed to send him pictures all the time. That was probably against spy code.<br>\n<br>\nHe looked through them again just to check. None of them looked like Steve was a spy, but a good spy would be able to hide it.<br>\n<br>\nHuh.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nBucky wasn\u2019t so much of a casual around-the-park jogger as he was the kind of person who found his way to the running track at his local gym twice a week after his workout was done and stayed on it until he had to get home for The Voice (or whatever came on television that night that worked as a good excuse for him to stop running hard around a track).<br>\n<br>\nSam had been trying to convince him to go with him on his morning jogs for ages, but Bucky always had the good sense to say no and sleep in for an extra hour.<br>\n<br>\nNot today, though. Today saw him bundled up in layers of spandex to stay warm in the frigid winter air, because Sam was a monster. Sam was the jogging equivalent to the yoga people Steve had sent him a picture of.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cAww hell,\u201d Sam said when he saw Bucky. Bucky had literally needed to take the subway to get there, an earlier one than he strictly needed because he wasn\u2019t sure what time Sam usually started and he knew there was a huge margin of error if he incorrectly assumed Sam\u2019s starting point was the entrance closest to his apartment. This was in no way convenient for him, and he saluted Sam with his disposable coffee cup and grimaced at the sun rising on the horizon. He hadn\u2019t felt this haggard in the morning since his hung-over and still going to work days.<br>\n<br>\nGod, he <em>was</em> old.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cHey Sam,\u201d Bucky greeted, trying for cheerful and accomplishing something more along the lines of resentful.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sam answered. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask him to meet? This is pathetic.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWell I would,\u201d Bucky answered, tossing his coffee and making sure his sunglasses were in place. \u201cBut then I\u2019d miss the look on your face.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSam rolled his eyes like someone long aggrieved by his friend choices. \u201cCome on, Indoor Runner, let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSam wasn\u2019t exactly a slow jogger. He had a pace and he stuck to it, and Bucky could respect the endurance that took. Bucky was the kind of guy who liked sprinting, expelling all his energy in one go, and not wasting any more time than he had to. Jogging around a park was good for the kind of thing Sam did. He could take in the scenery, enjoy checking out the woman with the Pomeranian who greeted him by name, and just meander along at his own pace.<br>\n<br>\nSlow and steady and all that.<br>\n<br>\nBucky was bored. Bucky was bored and there was no sign of Steve Rogers.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Sam asked, his breath a steady inhale-exhale after Bucky had just finished running around one of the side trails, meeting back up with him. \u201cIf I wanted an over-exuberant running partner with a low attention span, I\u2019d get a puppy.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cMy grandma is faster than you,\u201d Bucky sniped back. \u201cWith her walker.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I mention?\u201d Sam continued with a smile that was too much teeth. \u201cSteve takes Mondays off.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky stopped dead. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d he told Sam, who was jogging away at his steady pace. \u201cI\u2019m going home!\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSam waved his hand.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou could have started with that!\u201d Bucky was outright yelling now, partially because he felt a little like this deserved yelling, but mostly because Sam was actually pulling away from him. \u201cWould have saved yourself the annoyance!\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d last a mile, Indoor Runner.\u201d Sam yelled back. \u201cI was looking for a good laugh.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cFuck you, Sam Wilson.\u201d Bucky walked backwards with his middle fingers thrust in the air.<br>\n<br>\nBy the time Bucky reached the subway, he was aware of his mistake. His thigh and calf muscles were burning, and his feet had tender spots that made him think he was a few steps away from a blister. Fuck running on pavement, there was no way he could complain about this to anyone. It would get back to Sam and then he\u2019d lord it over Bucky for ages.<br>\n<br>\nThe only good thing that came from the entire morning was the picture he\u2019d taken of Sam plodding along in front of him, stepping up his pace to pass a man with a stroller. He sent it to Steve.<br>\n<br>\n<em>You jog with Sam?</em> Steve texted back almost immediately, no picture attached.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Sometimes on Sunday night I think that this will be the week I start exercising in nature. Usually by Monday morning I\u2019m 100% done with that idea,</em> Bucky responded. It wasn\u2019t exactly a lie, but it also hinted at Bucky going out more than just this once and told a story far different from the truth. The truth was that Bucky hated exercising in nature, hated waking up at 5:30 in the morning, and would not do it again, not even for Steve.<br>\n<br>\n<em>It\u2019s not for everyone</em>, Steve agreed. <em>Sorry I missed it this morning, though. I would have tried to be there if I\u2019d known.</em><br>\n<br>\nThat was something, at least. Even if Steve hadn\u2019t sent a picture of himself as was their habit. Maybe he really was a spy.<br>\n<br>\nThen the image came through of Steve in bed, his face creased from his pillow and his eyes still heavy.<br>\n<br>\nUsually Bucky would enjoy a picture like that, but mostly he just felt jealous that at least Steve was smart enough not to wake up early on a Monday morning.</p>\n<p>By noon, he was fed up with not seeing Steve in person. If it was their \u2018thing\u2019 then their \u2018thing\u2019 was lamer than <em>La porte vert.</em><br>\n<br>\n<em>Let\u2019s meet</em>, he texted Steve, taking a deep breath as he thumbed the send button on his phone. He exhaled and checked to see if Steve responded before he set his phone to the lock screen and tried his best not to check it every five minutes.<br>\n<br>\nTwo hours later and Bucky still hadn\u2019t heard back. He had opened his phone twice to make sure that somehow he hadn\u2019t missed the text coming through in the second it took between staring at the message history and turning on the lock screen. He hadn\u2019t. His last text sat there mocking him and he had visions of it being the final text in their string of messages until Steve\u2019s conversation moved to the bottom of his contacts and eventually Bucky ended up deleting him.<br>\n<br>\nHe wanted to berate himself, but a part of him, the part not freaking out over not hearing from Steve in a few hours, was actually glad he\u2019d done it. If Steve didn\u2019t want to meet, and didn\u2019t even text him to explain why, then Bucky didn\u2019t want to invest any more of himself in that relationship.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>Sure!!</em><br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>You sent this hours ago, I\u2019m so sorry. Let\u2019s meet.</em><br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>The Bean Grind on Saturday at 3?</em><br>\n<br>\nBucky watched as his phone lit up, one text after the other.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>But why don\u2019t we make this fun? Standing date next Sat, but earlier if you can find me first?</em><br>\n<br>\nBucky stared at the text for a moment. Seriously? He responded. Because seriously? Steve was giving him permission to track him down? <em>Are you sure you want to go there?</em><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>I like clever men.</em><br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>Besides, Saturday is Valentine\u2019s Day and that\u2019s a clich\u00e9 too obvious for two Brooklynites.</em><br>\n<br>\nWell hell.<br>\n<br>\n<em>No using Sam,</em> Steve sent as a final edict.<br>\n<br>\nChallenge accepted.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nTuesday after work found Bucky loitering about three subway stops away from his apartment.<br>\n<br>\nHe vaguely knew the area Steve lived in because of the amount of recognisable landmarks in his selfies, and yet he wasn\u2019t sure if it was creepy to be walking around the stop that was his best educated guess to be the one Steve used. It was based on a picture Steve had sent once of the morning fog, heavy on the street. Bucky also considered the times Steve usually worked, which was a more difficult thing to get a grasp on. Steve didn\u2019t seem to follow traditional 9-5 hours, or if he did, he put in a lot of overtime.<br>\n<br>\nBucky was walking around the block, checking in stores to see if he could spot anyone who looked like Steve. He really needed to narrow down a point in Steve\u2019s schedule, because this was disastrously stalky.</p>\n<p>Emphasis on disaster.<br>\n<br>\nBut it was possibly the best thing that ever happened to him when he passed one of the intersections and almost dropped his phone into a grate when he was fumbling to quickly retrieve it from his pocket of his tight jeans.<br>\n<br>\nHoly shit, this was the best day ever. He didn\u2019t even know if he could convey this in a text without just sending a string of exclamation points.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cA phone call? Really?\u201d Sam sounded like he was throwing shade, for someone who had to make phone calls to verify his identity about once a week now that Steve set a standard that Bucky was only happy to keep up.<br>\n<br>\n\"So you know how your girlfriend works at a <em>FedEx Office store</em>?\" Bucky questioned, the moment Sam picked up, putting specific emphasis on the place where Nat worked. His voice sounded calmer than he felt.<br>\n<br>\n\"I'm pretty sure that's code for the fact she can't tell me what her actual job is.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Not everyone is a spy,\" Bucky answered with a barely covered laugh. \"Sometimes people really do work for FedEx.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"What?\" Sam asked.<br>\n<br>\n\"I mean, sometimes you search every single copy shop in the tri-state area just to prove a point, and sometimes you hit pay dirt when you\u2019re trying to track down your sexting partner on a dare.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"What?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"I found Natasha, FedEx Office employee,\" Bucky finished with glee.<br>\n<br>\n\"That's bullshit.\" Sam sounded uncertain.<br>\n<br>\n\"Sure, Sam,\u201d Bucky said in a placating, condescending tone. \u201cHold on, I'm going to get a picture.\"<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWait! Don\u2019t do it. She\u2019ll kill you.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nGood point. But then, Bucky had said he was going to find Natasha if it killed him. \u201cGonna do it anyway.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky knew he had to be quick about it, walking up fast to Natasha's cash before she noticed him and aiming his phone in her face. He forgot his flash was on, so he probably deserved the attempted black eye.<br>\n<br>\nIt was definitely worth it. Even Natasha texting him that she would kill him five minutes after he left the store was worth it. There were a lot of things Bucky regretted in his life, but that was not one of them.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nIt wasn\u2019t like Bucky had a driving need to prove himself to Steve, it was just\u2026 Steve had dared him to come find him.<br>\n<br>\nOk, so Bucky had a driving need to prove himself to Steve.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, he had trouble resisting dares.<br>\n<br>\nPlus, Steve was kind of a huge enabler. On Monday night he sent Bucky a picture of his television. He was watching Elementary \u2013 that was a taunt, right?<br>\n<br>\nBucky wasn\u2019t sure until Steve also texted: <em>Sherlock would have found me by now.</em><br>\n<br>\nBucky was kind of frighteningly into how much of a jerk Steve could be. <em>You wouldn\u2019t be able to put up with Sherlock for long, Watson,</em> he texted back. <em>You\u2019d eventually need to put him in his place.</em><br>\n<br>\n<em>Have you even seen the show?</em> Steve questioned.<br>\n<br>\nGreat, now that was something else Bucky was going to have to add to his list.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>We should watch it together. Once you find me.</em><br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>Imagine spending hours pressed together on my couch.</em><br>\n<strong>Steve:</strong><br>\n<em>Seems like a waste of time that you\u2019re not here next to me.</em><br>\n<br>\nBecause Steve was a taunting little shit, he texted Bucky where he was having lunch, the location familiar to Bucky. There wasn\u2019t a thing he could do about it because he was heading into a meeting it was mandatory he attend. He sent back a picture of the boardroom.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Whoops.</em> Steve texted him with a smiley emoji.<br>\n<br>\nBy Wednesday, Bucky was standing with a clear view of Steve Rogers. Steve was sitting in a subway car, absorbed with his phone. He was in the middle of lifting it up to take a picture of himself when it hit Bucky exactly what was happening and instead of approaching Steve, he took a picture of Steve taking a selfie he was probably sending to Bucky.<br>\n<br>\nMeta as fuck.<br>\n<br>\nIt would be so easy for Bucky to get on the train after sending the picture. He had time, but instead he found himself watching Steve stare at his phone. He looked\u2026 lonely.<br>\n<br>\nIt was obvious when Steve received the picture because his head jerked up, eyes searching until they rested on Bucky. Bucky smiled and waved as the doors slid shut. He kept waving as Steve stood, looking out the door and as the train moved away from the platform. <em>Tag, you\u2019re it,</em> Bucky texted Steve.<br>\n<br>\nx.x.x.<br>\n<br>\nBucky looked up from his club sandwich when his phone lit up with a message. The image was of him cramming the last bite and a half of one of the sandwich corners into his mouth and was so unflatteringly ridiculous that he had to stare at it for a moment, impressed. It seemed to be originating from the booth next to the one he was sitting in and Bucky looked towards the divider between them. Steve probably would have had to walk in a low crouch to get there without Bucky noticing. \u201cWow. That is kind of creepy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, hoping Steve was still next to him.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI regret coming up with the challenge in the first place,\u201d Steve admitted. His voice was deeper than Bucky would have placed it, and yet seemed right. His head appeared over the partition, looking at Bucky with his clear blue eyes crinkling at the corners in mirth.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou should join me for lunch,\u201d Bucky offered. \u201cI feel a little like Deep Throat talking like this.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhile I appreciate the reference,\u201d Steve responded, smirking at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think it evokes the meaning you intended.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWho says?\u201d Bucky knew exactly what the reference should have made Steve think about. Bucky knew how to flirt with someone using his brain.<br>\n<br>\nSteve slid into the booth across from him. \u201cHi,\u201d Bucky said with a smile. \u201cWelcome to our first date.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDate?\u201d Steve questioned, but there was a teasing lilt to his tone, and a smirk on his face. Bucky might not know him in person, but he knew enough about Steve to understand that he wasn\u2019t being entirely serious. \u201cYou asked to meet, so I thought we were just arranging a meeting. No one said anything about dating.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky was actually pretty sure that Steve had mentioned the word date when he brought up the fact that Saturday was Valentine\u2019s Day, but Bucky also knew how to play along. \u201cDo you really think that either of us would have put so much effort into the chase we just led each other on if we weren\u2019t interested in dating.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWell there\u2019s that,\u201d Steve mused, actually rubbing his chin like he was thinking about it. \u201cI think the sexting was more of a clue that I\u2019m interested in you.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nBucky grinned, slow and dirty. \u201cBaby,\u201d he drawled in a low tone, not entirely serious about the pet name but hoping to make Steve flustered. \u201cI can think of at least one picture that proves <em>how interested</em> I am in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve seemed flustered, but he grinned at Bucky, soft and shy as he ducked his head and looked directly at Bucky through his eyelashes. \"I'm glad we found each other,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheesy, Steve,\u201d Bucky pointed out, but he couldn\u2019t help but grin back.</p>\n<p>x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Bucky slurred, reaching for Steve with his bare arm. It felt overly heavy from exertion, so he dropped in back on the warm, empty space beside him and squinted up at Steve standing over him with his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking a picture to show Sam why I\u2019m skipping our run this morning,\u201d Steve responded.</p>\n<p>Bucky grinned, delighted. \u201cWell in that case,\u201d he answered, pulling the sheet down to expose more of his torso. \u201cMake it worthwhile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping that one,\u201d Steve answered, slipping back beneath the covers. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about our selfie problem, and I think if we really\u2026 oh, Sam sent back a pukey face emoji.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRude,\u201d Bucky huffed, settling closer to Steve and enjoying his warmth. \u201cHold on, keep that face,\u201d he said, groping for his own phone. \u201cExcellent,\u201d he considered, sending Steve\u2019s sarcastic expression as he looked at his phone to Sam. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t want this to happen, he should have introduced us when I asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d Steve pressed his mouth against Bucky\u2019s and took another picture of the two of them kissing. \u201cI agree on that one. Putting up with us flirting for an hour is probably better than receiving pictures of every moment we have from now on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course Sam had given Steve the same reason for not introducing them. Of course. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d Bucky decided. \u201cAnd evil.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve smirked at him. \u201cI answer to Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Perfect. \u201cYeah? Let\u2019s see if you can make me call it out.\u201d Bucky was already aroused, pressed against all of Steve\u2019s bare skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that being a challenge,\u201d Steve answered, peeling back the blanket and putting his mouth against Bucky\u2019s navel. He continued to move downwards, his hand stroking Bucky\u2019s cock before he shifted slightly, licking his lips as he fit his mouth over the tip of Bucky\u2019s erection.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I send a picture of this?\u201d Bucky questioned, voice strained and only half joking.</p>\n<p>Steve looked up at him through his eyelashes, considering, before he pulled back enough to give Bucky an answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
