  "text": "<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first daughter of King Agdar and Queen Idun is born in the middle of a snowstorm, with huge blue eyes, wisps of white hair, and cold fingertips, but all her parents can see are the thin, criss-crossing lines that span her tiny palm, meaningless chicken scratch where there should have been letters.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Idun cries when she sees them, rubbing restlessly over the marks. Her own fingers go blue with the cold that seems to seep from her beautiful child\u2019s perfectly five-fingered little hand, but she can\u2019t stop until Agdar, his face still and quiet, reaches out to cover her hand with his own. Idun looks at her name, there in her own graceful handwriting on his flesh, and shakes her head quietly. \u201cMy love, what do we do?\u201d she murmurs quietly, so the midwife and servants don\u2019t hear, propping her head tiredly against his shoulder.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Agdar, normally so sure and decisive, only closes his eyes and pulls them both tightly to him. Neither of them knows what to do with a child who doesn\u2019t have a true love.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The three month old Princess Elsa of Arendelle is presented to the people of Arendelle in a traditional baptismal ceremony, already wearing perfectly miniature kidskin gloves. The peerage is hushed and leery; she is too beautiful to suspect, but her eyes are so quiet and solemn, and she doesn\u2019t even flinch when the priest sprinkles the cold water on her brow.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Idun and Agdar hold her together, but are also holding each other.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa\u2019s nursemaid falls asleep on a blanket underneath the almond tree in the royal gardens, and by the time Elsa\u2019s screaming cries penetrate her midsummer sleep, every rose in the garden is frozen into solid, glittering ice.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The nursemaid doesn\u2019t stop shaking even as Agdar counts out a double handful of gold into her purse. They do not hire another one; Idun tends Elsa by herself, as she would have had her hand held the name of a common merchant or shepherd, rather than the crown prince of Arendelle. Agdar, unable to bear the lines of exhaustion on her face, shuts the door of their chambers and relieves her of her tiny, beloved burden as soon as his duties are over.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In public, together, he carries Elsa in his arms, his grave little heir, her gloved fingers fisted up in his shirtsleeves.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They very nearly won\u2019t risk having another child, but the veins in Elsa\u2019s thin wrists and throat are so stark and blue against her alabaster skin, and Idun bites all the skin off her lips rather than risk wondering aloud if her daughter\u2019s lack of a true love is because she won\u2019t live long enough to meet one.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna is born with Adgar\u2019s red hair and a warm palm that Idun presses her lips to, over and over, murmuring the name written on it. She holds her breath when the door creaks open and Adgar appears, leading Elsa towards the bed. Idun watches Elsa\u2019s still-unsteady steps through her tears.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Agdar\u2019s urging, and with his assistance, Elsa climbs up next to them and looks down into her sister\u2019s hale little face with a crease between her brows. She stares, for a long time, until Anna hiccups and stirs, blinking her eyes open and peering blearily up at Elsa.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is the first time they have ever seen Elsa smile.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Idun feels hope flutter up in her chest. After all, there are many kinds of love.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Idun doesn\u2019t want to favor one child over the other, but Anna is so easy to love, all kisses and sweet laughter and wild imagination, and ever since the accident Elsa is closed like all of the palace doors and windows behind her, eyes wide and old like the days before Anna was born.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe\u2019re killing her, Agdar,\u201d Idun ventures once, early on, listening to the wind howling outside their window and knowing her daughter\u2019s sobs are drowning in it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adgar leans both hands against the mantlepiece and stares down into the fire. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose them both,\u201d he says finally, unable to look at her as he does. \u201cWe must keep Anna safe.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Idun rubs his name on her palm and understands. For the good of Arendelle, and the promise in the name on Anna\u2019s palm, her heart breaks.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa knows to never ask about the black scratches on her hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before she even knows about words, and true loves, she knows to zealously guard against anyone who might remove her gloves, and once her father teaches her to read, she reads her mother\u2019s name in his hand, and his name in hers, and she waits until the entire castle is asleep before carefully peeling off the kidskin glove in the dim light of the banked fire and staring, aghast, at the meaningless lines there.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fire freezes over and Elsa runs back to bed with tears in her eyes, yanking her glove back on so hard that her fingertips hurt.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She knows it\u2019s because she\u2019s a witch, and witches don\u2019t get true loves.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her father never says the word, but Elsa hears whispers on the wind, and remembers the look on the troll king\u2019s mossy face when he took her hands. She remembers the way her father\u2019s voice broke when he asked, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d and she thinks, privately and often, that it perhaps would have been better if she had been left with the trolls.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That was what happened to witches in stories. They stayed in the dark forests, far from people, and killed any who came too close, because they needed to take their true love.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa listened to Anna singing through the door and bit at her gloved fingers to stifle her sobs. <em>We must keep Anna safe</em>, her father had said. Elsa knew it was because she was a witch, and Anna had a true love to steal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Conceal, don\u2019t feel.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the days after the funeral, Elsa wakes every night in a bedchamber full of ice, until she begins to fear sleep as much as she fears waking, and all she can do is throw herself miserably into the business of becoming the best successor to her father she can be.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She has regents, of course, and will until she comes of age, but she has been at the king\u2019s elbow since she was old enough to stand there, and they are not surprised at her firm, decisive rule. The loss of King Agdar is scarcely noticed outside the realm. The economy prospers. The navy grows, though Elsa will never step foot upon a single ship.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Those few neighboring kingdoms who think to test Arendelle\u2019s fortitude return whispering tales of the fierce, implacable teenaged queen whose hair shines like diamonds from the parapet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Witch-queen she may be, and cursed, but Elsa will do her duty.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On coronation day, Elsa is most anxious about removing her glove, for the ceremony.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She knows the anxiety makes the ice worse, but she doesn\u2019t have her father there to stare into her eyes and remind her, so she stays up all the night before, peeling off the glove and scooping up a makeshift orb, over and over in the mirror until she can almost do it without revealing her palm.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She can\u2019t stop shaking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She hides in her father\u2019s - <em>her</em> - office, with the door closed and her coronation gown already cinched into place, rubbing her gloves together and listening to Anna\u2019s cheerful singing on the wind. Panic making her mean, she thinks about sending a guard to shush her sister, and perhaps a regent to give a stern speech on appearances and family pride, but instead she only hugs herself with both arms and imagines a world where there is no such thing as true love.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a few blessed moments, everything is okay.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Later, in the quiet of her ice fortress, Elsa will laugh at the realization that only a person with the luxury of a true love would be so foolish as to say it didn\u2019t matter. If she had only said - if Anna had known what Elsa had done for the sake of her chance at true love - then she would not have agreed to marry Hans without even asking him to remove his glove, would not have accepted his blithe, too-quick, \u2018Right, that\u2019s my given name, but everyone calls me Hans,\u2019 would not have labeled the first flush of attraction as a destiny born and written.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She will replay the look of shocked pity on Anna\u2019s face at the sight of her meaningless palm over and over, perhaps for the rest of her life.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her entire life has been one single, grave miscalculation: witches live alone in the forest because there\u2019s no one in the human world who loves them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And there are many kinds of love.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna loves her, with a surety and lack of guile that Elsa can\u2019t even respond to some days, overwhelmed that Anna doesn\u2019t need her to beg forgiveness, and Olaf loves her with a queer sort of enthusiastic understanding and devotion that Elsa needs as much as she needs air.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She and Kristoff - the real Kristoff, who is exactly the Kristoff she might have imagined for Anna had she thought to imagine him - even come to a kind of affection, bound together by their mutual adoration of Anna. (She certainly sees no point in disliking the man who was quite literally born with Anna written into his body.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most surprising, to her, is the way Arendelle loves her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa weeps openly when they cheer at her return, pressing her bare palms to her chest and leaning against the parapet, overwhelmed in a way that should have been frightening but instead felt only wondrous. <em>Long live the Queen!</em> the cheer ripples back through the crowd, and Elsa feels it through to her bones, and almost believes it possible.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A week before Anna comes of age, half the kindgom plunged into preparation for her birthday nuptials, a ship with four, oddly affixed sails appears in the fjord, bringing with it sailors with faces the likes of which Arendelle has never seen, and a cargo of exotic wares the like of which Arendelle has never seen.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna nearly eats her own tongue at the feel of the fabric in her hands, repeating the strange word - <em>silk</em> - over and over until it sounds meaningless again, begging Elsa to purchase it so that her wedding gown might be fashioned from it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa is about to remind Anna that her wedding gown was finished weeks ago, when she sees the markings on the elegantly scrolled trade proposal from the emperor she is given, and forgets to breathe.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She buys Anna all the silk she wants, and waits for a moment when she can speak to the head merchant alone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They can barely understand each other, and have been relying on a jumpy interpreter whose eyes are sly and remind Elsa of Hans, but when Elsa turns her back to hide her actions, and peels the glove from her hand, his face opens up in understanding and he takes her hand in his own, tilting his head to regard it thoughtfully.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He smiles gently, and traces at the lines there. \u201c<em>Mulan</em>,\u201d he reads gravely. Then he frowns, as if reminded suddenly of something important.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Still with her hand held in his own, he tugs her over to the scroll and releases her to turn the wooden handles past several lines of characters. Elsa sees a picture of an old man - she assumes the emperor, for the grave look on his face and the attention the artist paid to the delicate embroidery in his robes - and several other people and places, until he reaches a small pictograph. He grins toothily, and taps the picture. \u201c<em>Fa Mulan</em>,\u201d he says proudly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa reaches with both hands to turn the painting rightside up. She shakes like a leaf and wishes Anna would stop fawning over the silk and come hold her upright. In one hand, the woman holds a long, curving sword. Her other hand is open, and written across it, in a hand unused to the shape of the letters, is Elsa\u2019s name.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She does faint, after all.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By the time she begins to regain her bearings, there is a cup of floral, green-tinted tea being poured in front of her nose and Anna has invited the entire merchant vessel to her wedding.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa is too overwhelmed, so she forgets to tell Anna to be circumspect, and she watches the rumor that she\u2019s found her true love after all spread through the castle and kingdom, until she finds herself the still, slightly anxious eye in the center of a hurricane of joy.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAren\u2019t you happy, Elsa?!\u201d Anna blurts finally, standing up on a pedestal for her final wedding dress pinning. The seamstress\u2019 compromise on the fabric was a closely tailored mantle of goldshot ivory. Anna glows in it, even while she\u2019s trying to be angry.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa sighs and dismisses the seamstress and her assistant for a moment. \u201cYes, Anna,\u201d she admits quietly. \u201cBut... there\u2019s a lot to think about.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cLike what?\u201d Anna scoffs. \u201cShe\u2019s your true love!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYes,\u201d Elsa agrees quickly, gesturing for her sister to keep her voice down. \u201cAnd she\u2019s more than a year\u2019s journey away, and a <em>woman</em>.\u201d The last thing really isn\u2019t much of a point; true love is true love, and Elsa is far from the first destined to be with one of the same sex.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That Elsa is the queen regnant changes things only slightly; after all, Anna is as much the blood of Arendelle as she, and Elsa had been planning to name her children as heirs from the moment she took the throne.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna steps down awkwardly and grips Elsa\u2019s hands in both her own. \u201cElsa,\u201d she murmurs, and Elsa has heard her name in that tone before. It\u2019s how she knows she\u2019s begun to cry.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh, Anna,\u201d she sighs, tilting her head back to keep her tears from staining the wedding dress. Unexpectedly, her anxiety bubbles all the way over into mirth, and she finds she cannot stop laughing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve ruined your wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna hugs her so quickly and so hard that all of the air is forced from Elsa\u2019s lungs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin my wedding, Elsa. This is the only way you could possibly have made it even more wonderful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa had never known that Anna felt guilty for finding true love, when she knew Elsa couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After seeing Anna and Kristoff away on their honeymoon, the two of them bundled thick as thieves in Kristoff\u2019s sleigh, Sven prancing so that the bells on his harness chime proudly, Elsa locks herself in her office and frets all night over the contents of a letter she never thought she would need to compose.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the sun comes up, Olaf pads quietly into the room, a warm pastry balanced carefully on a tray, just outside the circle of his snowcloud. \u201cGood morning, your majesty!\u201d he chirps, and Elsa groans with both hands rubbing at her eyes, wondering silently at her life\u2019s luck, to be surrounded by people who love her immeasurably but have no concept of an inside tone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cGood morning, Olaf,\u201d she says, knowing he wouldn\u2019t understand if she shushed him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHere,\u201d he pushes the tray onto a mostly empty corner of her desk. \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat very much last night, you know. You\u2019re supposed to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa almost cries at his thoughtful concern, she\u2019s so ragged, but instead she simply picks up the pastry and crams an exaggeratedly large bite into her mouth. Olaf lights up and wiggles a bit, humming happily. \u201cI\u2019m very glad you\u2019re here, Olaf,\u201d she tells him once she\u2019s swallowed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He grins and puffs up proudly. \u201cI\u2019m very glad you\u2019re here, too, your majesty.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She reaches down with her powers and gently lifts him onto the desk, so that she can stand and look him in the eye. \u201cDo you know what happened, Olaf?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He clasps his twig hands together in front of him and nods. \u201cDo you think they have snow in China?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa laughs. \u201cI\u2019m certain they do. Look, there is a drawing of it here!\u201d She unrolls the emperor\u2019s scroll, and shows him the heavy-limbed tree, with the little birds scratching below it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOhhhhhh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Olaf breathes, leaning close. \u201cAt least there will be snow for us, when we get there.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa breathes out quickly, pained by his usual ability to cut right to the heart. \u201cOlaf, we can\u2019t go to China. I\u2019m the Queen of Arendelle.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Olaf frowns with his whole body. \u201cBut that\u2019s where your true love is.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the interpreter realizes what she\u2019s saying, Elsa has to pay him double for his discretion, and then breathe the same air as him for three days while he goes between her and Yin, the merchant captain, who promises with kind eyes that he writes a fair hand and will be able to get the letter to Fa Mulan.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As she bids him farewell, he places a slim volume in her hands. \u201cThe Song of Fa Mulan,\u201d he tells her slowly. \u201cI will... return.\u201d There is a dragon on the cover of the book. Elsa hugs it to her chest as watches the ship disappear over the horizon.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A year\u2019s journey, in one direction.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another year, to return.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna and Kristoff return from their honeymoon with flushed cheeks and a hundred new jokes they\u2019re anxious to share with her, and Elsa laughs when she\u2019s meant to. But she\u2019s thinking about ships, and how they sometimes don\u2019t come back.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She reads the Song of Fa Mulan a hundred times.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is written in Chinese, but tucked between each page is a careful translation, and the pictures are beautiful.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It doesn\u2019t occur to Elsa what a gift it is until she\u2019s devoted the entire translated song to memory. By the first natural frost, she can read the whole original, and has begun, haltingly, to translate the emperor\u2019s scroll.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cTell me about her,\u201d Anna requests on Christmas Eve.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kristoff and Sven have fallen asleep in front of the fire in the great hall and Elsa is distracted, covering Arendelle in the gentlest of Christmas snows, enough to muffle the rooftops and glitter the morning sun, so she hums obligingly and drops her head onto Anna\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cShe\u2019s an only child,\u201d she begins dreamily. \u201cAnd when the Huns threatened China, the emperor called for one male from every family. Her father was old and ill, and for the sake of her family\u2019s honor, she disguised herself as a boy, and went in his name...\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She knows something of what Mulan looks like, from the pictures, and she imagines the rest, waving her fingers idly as she spins the scenes from the song in delicate moving ice crystals.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna and Olaf listen to stories with the bated-breath enthusiasm of children. In the middle of the final battle scene at the palace, Anna has her hands over her eyes, fingers splayed as Elsa sends the icy dragon flying across the sky. \u201cElsa,\u201d she breathes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa pauses, tiny ice Mulan frozen, armed with nothing but a fan, facing off against a barbarian the book\u2019s illustrators gave demonic, pointed teeth and shoulders like mountains, and feels her breath catch in her throat as she realizes what Anna means. \u201cI... I know, Anna,\u201d she admits. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Elsa,\u201d Olaf reminds her sleepily.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa likes the little dragon, the way she can make the ice flow and shimmer in some places and go sharp and opaque in others, the way his ears flop and the funny little whiskers that hang from his nose, so she keeps practicing on him.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The wind brings her:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Dragons aren\u2019t real, Princess Anna. It's just a story.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>You mean like the ice queen isn\u2019t real, my lord?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On her birthday, Anna comes to her and asks, very cautiously, if becoming an aunt would be a welcome present. Elsa by now has learned to close her eyes and smile against things that make her want to scream, so instead of telling Anna she\u2019s still too much a child to have children (and it's done, after all, isn't it, no use being hurtful), she wraps Anna up in her arms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Arendelle is happy to stop staring wistfully at the horizon for their good news, and start singing songs and making gifts for the promise of a little heir presumptive. Elsa has to explain babies to Olaf three times before she can look into his agog face without giggling.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa tells herself that with Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf loving so unflinchingly, a child can take one anxiety-ridden aunt that frets about socks and safety, and sometimes takes dinner alone in her office.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It becomes a chore, getting Anna to stay off her feet. Elsa and Kristoff take it in shifts. If it wasn\u2019t so close to Christmas Elsa would be far more cross about her sister\u2019s disregard for her health. As it is, she curls up happily against Anna\u2019s headboard and uses the fire to make icy shadow puppets. Anna is close to sleeping when she finally manages to work up the courage to ask.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow is true love different from other kinds of love?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna shifts gracelessly, one eye cracking open. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa chuckles soundlessly and shoves aside the lock of white hair that Anna can\u2019t ever seem to make stay in a braid. \u201cHow is it different, with Kristoff?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna shifts almost to her knees, quickly, and only with a look of censure from Elsa does she ease back down. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Elsa.\u201d She looks down at her own palm, running her fingers along the letters of Kristoff\u2019s name. \u201cIt\u2019s like - my whole life I\u2019ve dreamed about him, but now he has a face, and he talks, and sometimes I just can\u2019t breathe when I look at him because he\u2019s whole and real and I\u2019m awake and he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cBut, how do you know he\u2019s different from any other lover? How is he different from Hans?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna starts when Elsa says the name; it\u2019s a verboten thing, between them, but Elsa has been steeling herself for this conversation for weeks now. \u201cI can feel it. Here,\u201d she touches her fingertips gently to Elsa\u2019s heart. \u201cWhen he\u2019s near me it\u2019s like every part of me wakes up and reaches for him.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa doesn\u2019t tell her that she thinks that sounds unpleasant and terrifying.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If Elsa was anyone else, she\u2019d have died of exposure long ago, the number of times she\u2019s fallen asleep on the parapet, watching the horizon.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She is loud, and red, and wrinkly, with wisps of downy blond hair frizzing out in all directions and a nose much more suited to her father\u2019s face. Elsa had no idea it was possible for something so ugly to be so beautiful.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna wants to name her after Elsa, but Elsa asks for Brynhilde, instead, for the only woman in their hall of ancestral portraits to pose in armor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first time Elsa feels brave enough to hold her, it takes some coaxing, her fingers tickling at chubby fingers and knuckles, before the tiny fist will open and let Elsa see the name in it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She presses her lips to the tiny palm and catches her tears with her smile.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMerry Christmas, Hilde,\u201d she whispers, swaying back and forth carefully, like Anna showed her.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>So loud</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Olaf smacks into her legs the second she pulls the door open, and Elsa can barely hear his apologies as he scrambles down the hallway. \u201cAnna?!\u201d She balks at shouting in the nursery, but she has to nearly scream to hear herself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna is collapsed on the settee with her fingers pressed hard into her face, pulling open eyes bloodshot with exhaustion. \u201cShe won\u2019t stop crying,\u201d she groans. \u201cIt's like she\u2019s cursed or something, she won\u2019t stop crying, I don\u2019t know what to do. She's not hungry, she's not wet, she's just <em>crying</em>.\u00a0I\u2019ve tried everything, and Kristoff went -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa bends over the bassinet and scoops Hilde up. She wails into Elsa\u2019s chest and the sound rattles all the way through her bones to her teeth; anxious and discomfited, she feels the tendril of magic escape, and only then realizes that in her haste to get to them, she\u2019d forgotten to replace her gloves. And Hilde has gone silent.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kristoff skids into the room with a sprig of mint clutched in his fist. \u201cGrandpappy said maybe this for her stomach will -\u201d He stares at Elsa, who stares back at him. She knows her eyes are wide with fear.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A tug on her scalp breaks the frozen stillness. She looks down into wide, blinking eyes as Hilde chomps contentedly on the end of her braid.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the morning of her birthday, Elsa creeps into the nursery just before Hilde wakes and carries her to the ballroom. Anna finds them there, Hilde chortling happily on Elsa\u2019s lap while Elsa directs the madcap movements of her ice dragon with gentle twitches of her fingers against her niece\u2019s tummy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cElsa!\u201d Anna yells, running through the door at full speed. Her feet hit an errant patch of ice and she\u2019s so accustomed to slipping at this point that she doesn\u2019t even break stride. \u201cElsa! There\u2019s a ship on the horizon!\u201d</p>\n<p>Elsa\u2019s control on her magic slips and the dragon shakes awake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the top of the keep, Elsa can see all four red sails. Her little dragon climbs up on her shoulder and wraps a frozen claw around the shell of her ear. She runs her fingers along the slick-smooth scales of his underbelly and tries to remember how to breathe.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIs it China?!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa looks down at Olaf, trying ridiculously to scurry up her hastily created spiral stairs. \u201cYes!\u201d she shouts back, grinning as he celebrates so quickly he falls over. She wraps both arms around her waist and reminds herself that she\u2019s been waiting for this. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The skies are very clear and the ship is still a long ways away. Elsa stands on the keep and watches for hours. The cold wind against her cheeks is a balm and Elsa begins to wonder if it\u2019s very important that she ever come down. The dragon curls up around her shoulders and falls asleep, purring softly.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A figure on the bow of the ship points a spyglass in her direction; with a hand gesture from him, a flag runs up the highest mast. Elsa makes herself focus enough to catch it in the wind, a red dragon\u2019s face snapping at her. She blesses Yin\u2019s thoughtfulness, to answer her question before even gaining port, and keeps repeating to herself, over and over, that this is what she wants.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYour majesty?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Conceal, don\u2019t feel.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c...Elsa?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHi, Olaf.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh, <em>good</em>. Will you help me get down? It\u2019s very high up here.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Olaf slips his fingers into hers and she looks down to meet his eyes. \u201cOf course, Olaf. We\u2019ll go down together.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna meets her at the barbican, changed from her sleep clothes into clothes more appropriate for the season. Elsa spares a tight smile for the sight of Hilde in her winter outfit, the rabbit fur lining so thick she can barely bend her arms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come,\u201d Elsa mutters. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a letter.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMaybe I came to see Captain Yin,\u201d she rebukes playfully. \u201cDid you ever think of that? Not everything is about you, Elsa.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(But what Elsa was really saying was<em> thank you</em>, and what Anna really said back was <em>you\u2019re welcome</em>.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As they step onto the docks, Elsa stops so abruptly that Olaf\u2019s arm comes off. She barely notices as he pulls it out of her fingers, complaining. Her eyes are glued to the woman Yin is shoving off the ship onto the dock with a gleeful expression.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not just a letter, then.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u201cElsa, if you faint right now I swear I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa means to open her mouth and say <em>hello</em>. What happens instead is, \u201cYou\u2019re shorter than I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d Anna giggles, covering her mouth with her hand. Elsa closes her eyes and counts slowly, hoping she wasn\u2019t understood. \u201cElsa,\u201d she tries again, touching her fingertips to her breastbone. \u201cI\u2019m Elsa.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYes,\u201d the woman agrees, and Elsa knows what she means because even without seeing her hand Elsa can feel it, the way her body hums forward, skin pricking with preternatural awareness. \u201cI am Fa Mulan.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She tips forward, bowing slightly. Elsa dips her head in acknowledgement, and shoves her tongue against her front teeth, wondering what she\u2019s supposed to do now. She doesn\u2019t like being so unprepared and with nothing to fall back on, all she can do is stare helplessly down at Mulan, and all Mulan does in return is stare back.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa wonders, in a part of her mind completely outside of the situation, if her pupils are as wide-blown as the ones she\u2019s staring into.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHi! I\u2019m Olaf, and I like warm hugs!\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan blinks, breaking the gaze to look down at Olaf\u2019s outstretched arms with her mouth hanging open. Her eyebrows creased, she takes one deep breath, begins to speak, and stops, huffing, bending slightly to peer more closely into Olaf\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou are made out of snow.\u201d Her voice is low and even, enough space between the words that Elsa suspects she\u2019s working hard to restrain an accent.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI am! Elsa made me!\u201d Olaf waggles his arms, still waiting for a hug. Mulan glances at Elsa and her eyes get stuck again. Elsa shrugs helplessly, not certain she remembers how to move her arms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yin rescues her, coming forward with sparkling eyes and hands pressed together. \u201cYour majesty,\u201d he bows. \u201cIt is very nice to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cCaptain Yin.\u201d She reaches out with both hands, relieved to have something other than Mulan\u2019s sundark skin, her salt-stained cambric shirt and the way it pulls against muscular arms as she bends to hug Olaf. Elsa inhales sharply and forces herself to look into Yin\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou learned English.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He smiles and squeezes her fingers. \u201cYes. It is better to talk like this. I do not like Stefano.\u201d (It takes Elsa a beat to remember that Stefano was the name of the translator, and by then Yin is speaking again.) \u201cI bring you good news, as I... promised.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa laughs faintly as Yin breaks eye contact to glance at Mulan, leaving her with nowhere for her eyes to fix except back on Mulan\u2019s face. \u201cNews. Yes, yes you...\u201d Elsa has to stop and take a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan smiles. The expression starts on one side of her face and crawls to the other and Elsa\u2019s heart is a hummingbird thrashing forward and she clenches her jaw and her fists. Mulan unfurls her palm and holds it out; if she speaks Elsa can\u2019t hear it over the roaring of blood in her ears.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, Anna steps in, reaching out and taking Mulan\u2019s hand, turning it to look at the name there. \u201cElsa, she\u2019s real,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa lifts her hand and looks at the glove, not sure she trusts herself enough to remove it. She must, though, and so she reaches and peels slowly, counting. She works it down to her fingers, just enough to tip her palm out and show Mulan the mark. When Mulan reaches for her hand, reflexively, Elsa snaps the glove back up and stumbles backwards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unseated, the dragon squeaks indignantly, and Mulan takes a step back herself. \u201cA dragon!\u201d she blurts, and a red, familiarly shaped head snaps out from the loose neck of her shirt, twin plumes of smoke erupting from his nostrils.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cA dragon!\u201d Anna points, and Hilde laughs, clapping and reaching.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI need to sit down,\u201d Elsa realizes quietly, two seconds before her body makes the decision for her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Elsa opens her eyes, Mulan is still there, perched on the arm at the other end of the settee. Elsa covers her eyes with her hand and peeks through two fingers. \u201cI fainted.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan nods, her chin propped on one hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI carried you.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa\u2019s eyes stray to Mulan\u2019s arms and she waits patiently for her brain to start working again. Mulan catches her and smirks, subtly flexing. Elsa scowls and kicks out with one foot, knocking Mulan\u2019s arm away from her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re intolerable.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI do not know what that means.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYes, you do.\u201d Elsa laughs and pushes herself upright, curling her legs up underneath her. She inhales slowly and makes herself meet Mulan\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you came.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan tips her head to the side, frowning. \u201cAre you not happy?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa looks at her, at the way she\u2019s clenched together, one knee shaking up and down slightly, and she wonders who told her to try and be still, as if Elsa is an easily spooked pony. She realizes what Mulan asked a beat too late for her answer to sound anything but awkward. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that. It\u2019s... I never thought you\u2019d leave China.\u201d She wants Mulan to be closer, but doesn\u2019t know how to articulate it, and can\u2019t imagine moving herself without looking awkward. Elsa is keenly aware of every inch of her body, all the terrible angles and clumsy bits of it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan slides down from the arm of the settee to the cushion, the fractional gain enough for Elsa to smile gratefully at her. She blinks, eyes flaring, and Elsa wonders if something about the expression isn\u2019t working. Her hand begins to reach out, and then stops.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI won\u2019t bite you,\u201d Elsa grumbles, but she tucks both hands up against her rib cage, elbows in tight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan smiles briefly. \u201cYour sister told me to be careful.\u201d She pauses and shifts. \u201cYin told me to be careful, too. Also Olaf. Well, really, Olaf said you were a little shy, but I think that he also meant -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa isn\u2019t aware of moving until Mulan abruptly stops talking and Elsa realizes her gloved fingertips are right against Mulan\u2019s lips. She freezes in place and breathes tight against the spur of magic that wants to escape at the feel of Mulan\u2019s breath on her fingers. \u201cUm,\u201d she says. Carefully she eases back and presses her shoulder blades into the furniture. \u201cI thought you were a general?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan frowns, repeating the unfamiliar word. Elsa bites her lip and takes a chance, drawing the character from the <em>Song</em> in the air in delicate strokes of ice. She\u2019s so worried that she\u2019ll look stupid that when Mulan\u2019s eyebrows shoot up she clenches her fist down on it immediately.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou can read?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI... well, maybe. A little bit? I only have this -\u201d Elsa stands abruptly and retrieves the <em>Song</em> from her desk. Mulan takes it from her and blushes, leafing through the pages while Elsa paces over to the window, tipping it open and pulling a cold wind onto her face. \u201cYin gave me a translation but I took it out a while ago. I\u2019ve been working on the other scroll I have, the one the emperor sent, and there are a lot of words I don\u2019t recognize but sometimes I can figure out the base character and sort of... um. Work it out.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan leans her chin on the back of the settee and blinks at her with an expression Elsa isn\u2019t sure how to interpret. Nervous, she wrings her hands and steals glances out of the corner of her eyes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI do not understand everything you just said,\u201d she says finally. \u201cBut I want to know if there is a book about you. Pictures, like this one.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Elsa feels herself blush. \u201cSome tavern songs, I think. Kristoff could be making those up to terrorize me, but -\u201d She realizes Mulan\u2019s point, and smiles apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re older than me, I think. And you... I mean, you weren\u2019t very old. When you went to war.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She wants to beg Mulan not to be mad at her, even though she isn\u2019t altogether sure that Mulan <em>is</em> mad at her. She doesn\u2019t know Mulan\u2019s face, not like she knows Anna\u2019s or even, to a less extent, Kristoff\u2019s. She waits and tries to watch without committing to eye contact, as Mulan\u2019s eyebrows cycle through a series of emotions before appearing to consciously smooth. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d she asks tightly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019m twenty-three.\u201d Elsa draws the Chinese number in the frost on the window. She likes the numbers. The numbers make sense to her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan\u2019s mouth shrugs down as her brow smooths. \u201cOlder than I imagined. Thank ancestors for that.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa huffs in mock-indignation. \u201cYou thought I was a child?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan laughs, tipping her head back and standing. \u201cI can\u2019t tell, with your face.\u201d She gestures vaguely at Elsa. \u201cBut you are correct. I was fifteen when I failed the matchmaker, and I am fifteen again since.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It takes Elsa a moment to puzzle out what she means, but she doesn\u2019t fully understand. \u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018failed the matchmaker?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan comes to lean against the windowsill, the wind catching and blowing at the ends of her hair, and Elsa can see her fighting the need to shiver. \u201cIn China, when you are fifteen, the matchmaker registers your name, and finds your match.\u201d She tries to smile, but the expression flickers and fails. \u201cShe laughed at my mine.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa wants to tell Mulan that there are worse things than someone laughing at your soulmark, but her jaw closes up and makes her eyes burn with tears, and the only thing she can think to do is reach out and close the window, to stop Mulan shivering.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And then because Mulan is so close, and Elsa is so useless, she pretends that she needs to go and speak to Yin about trade agreements.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u201cYin, what happens when you fail the matchmaker?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u201cWait for matchmaker to come back for you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u201cUntil... three tens.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u201cThirty.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\u201cYes. Then you are married to someone else who also fails.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa watches Mulan chasing Sven around the bailey from the window of her office, her wide-brimmed sailor\u2019s hat flopping around in his teeth, and she smothers her grin with a fist against her lips.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She waits until Mulan victoriously plunks the slobbery hat back on her head, and then knocks it off with a snowball, lifting both hands innocently when Mulan glares up at her. She\u2019s okay with the way Mulan\u2019s laughter lights her up inside as long as it\u2019s from very far away.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan would have been twenty-nine when Yin delivered Elsa\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa tries to imagine a life with a sword like that dangling over her head, and instead can only panic at the idea that Mulan is here for the rest of her life.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat are you doing, Elsa?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa is grooming her ice dragon with gentle wisps of frost - he won\u2019t leave Mulan\u2019s actual dragon alone, and occasionally she finds him curled up in Hilde\u2019s cradle, licking at various melted spots - and she uses that as an excuse to keep her voice mild and her back to Anna.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She knows what Anna means, and Anna knows that. She spent too many years keeping secrets from her, and it\u2019s lost its effectiveness.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat happens to people who don\u2019t find their true loves?\u201d she asks finally. \u201cDo you know? I\u2019ve never... asked anyone.\u201d Her entire life, talking about true love was forbidden in the castle, first by her father\u2019s edict, and then her own.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna sinks down next to her on the rug and touches her knee softly. \u201cWhy are you asking? You found her. She\u2019s downstairs right now, trying to teach Kristoff this horrible game that looks like chess that I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be really good at if you would just <em>talk to her</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa has finished grooming the dragon - she really should name him - but she still needs something to do with her hands, so she pets absently along his scales. \u201cIn China, if you don\u2019t find your true love before your thirtieth birthday, you marry someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cPeople get married without true love all the time, Elsa.\u201d She frowns. \u201cWell, common people do. It\u2019s different for us. We have a duty.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat if you -\u201d <em>Had died</em>. The words, even so many years and so many apologies later, fizzle and die in her throat. \u201cI would have had to get married. To a man. For Arendelle.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna smiles and looks somehow much older than Elsa is accustomed to seeing. \u201cThat\u2019s why we call these things <em>destiny</em> and don\u2019t sit alone in our niece\u2019s room fretting about them.\u201d She heaves herself to her feet and swoops fearlessly down to grab Elsa\u2019s hands, pulling. \u201cStop being an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Stop being an idiot.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Right.</p>\n<p><span></span><br><br>But she leaves an icy rose in Mulan\u2019s room, and Mulan comes to find her before the points on the thorns soften and melt. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou are afraid of me,\u201d Mulan accuses, water dripping on the floor between her fingers, her shoulders hunching as she shrinks, looking small and sheepish. \u201cI know I am...\u201d She takes a steeling breath and Elsa can\u2019t keep her eyes off of the veins and tendons in her throat. \u201cI am a soldier. I fought in two wars. I have scars and I\u2019m not... soft.\u201d Her chin is trembling and Elsa feels her lungs go tight with shame.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you,\u201d she says quietly, holding onto her own braid with both hands. Ice is crackling up to her scalp, delicate, razor sharp feathers of it that she can hear in lieu of the pounding in her own heart. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of myself.\u201d When Mulan meets her eyes, her hands flex and the ice races down her neck and scallops her clothing, freezes in deadly patterns on the wall behind her. \u201cYou should be afraid of me, too.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan shakes her head and lifts the rose, letting the stem slip through her fingers until she\u2019s cupping the bloom in her palm, running her thumb across the razor sharp petals so gently they neither melt nor cut. \u201cI am Fa Mulan.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The quiet confidence and solemn half-smile makes Elsa shiver all the way down to the pit of her stomach and she turns away before it shows on her face. \u201cDamn you,\u201d she says quietly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan laughs and steps forward, slipping the rose into Elsa\u2019s hair and touching her cold fingertips, briefly, to her chin. Elsa stares into her dark eyes and, paralyzed, feels herself tipping forward.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is only after Mulan leaves, still chuckling, that Elsa\u2019s brain catches up to the fact that she wanted Mulan to kiss her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Kiss her</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Oh</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa has always known, in an academic way, that Anna and Kristoff have a physical relationship, in much the same way she presumed that her parents had one. There\u2019s evidence, after all. Contrary to childhood deflection, Hilde was not delivered by stork.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa knows about attraction, but only insofar as it\u2019s something other people feel.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She thinks perhaps everyone else in the world is insane, because that\u2019s the only reason she can see for liking something that makes her feel completely nauseous and pricks hotly at her skin like the beginnings of a panic attack.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Attraction</em>. How completely mortifying.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the plus side, Admiral Dahl interrupts dinner that night to inform Elsa that there is a fleet of ships just outside of port, flying pirate colors and lining up their cannons. Anna whoops and Hilde takes advantage of the opportunity to fling the spoon she\u2019d been playing with at Kristoff\u2019s head. Even Elsa has to grin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan follows her up to the tower that affords the best view of the fjord, her face drawn in confusion and her hand loosely curled at her waist, as if seeking a sword. \u201cI may be misunderstanding,\u201d she ventures slowly, not at all winded as she keeps up with Elsa\u2019s longer stride. \u201cBut your general did say you were under attack by pirates, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe haven\u2019t had pirates in ages,\u201d Elsa enthuses (slightly winded by the stairs).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYes, but - \u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They reach the top of the tower and Elsa leans both hands on the edge, breathing deeply as the salty wind reaches her and fills her nose with the smell of gunpowder. Mulan sucks in a sharp breath and mutters a curse; Elsa will own that the formation is somewhat impressive and she lets Mulan linger in fear for a moment, beginning to smirk.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cForeign ships,\u201d she realizes in the silence, eying the odd angles of the sails and the unfamiliar colors. \u201cFriends of yours?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI will surrender to them,\u201d Mulan blurts, and Elsa blinks in surprise, gaping at her. \u201cI did not mean to endanger your people. I will -\u201d She begins to stumble down the stairs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201d Elsa says, her eyes pinned to Mulan\u2019s as she lifts her hand behind her, gathering her strength. \u201cI won\u2019t have you spoiling my fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa will never know the words for her powers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Words exist, painfully, for human emotions, clumsily traded back and forth since the invention of language, an oscillating lexicon that expands and contracts as needed, but there\u2019s never been anyone else to feel the way that Elsa does, never anyone to talk to about the way the ice exists in the air and reaches for her as she reaches for it. The wind and the water and how she breathes and <em>is</em>, and then <em>becomes</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa exhales <em>herself</em> down the curtain wall, the moisture in the air above the fjord lifting up to meet her like the beginning of a glorious piece of music, gathering up from a cacophony into a harmony, and high singing note, held for a breathless second before she spirals out in a fractalling wave of the purest cold.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ships freeze in the water, and the water freezes against the ships, and she pulls up the tarred, wooden sides and over the ports and cannons, the sails snapping wildly in her winds until she overwhelms them.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Elsa laughs, high and loose in her throat, her arms outstretched and her fingers spread, everything inside of her cold and still and perfect.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost a full seven years after defeating Shan Yu, Mulan accepts a post on the Great Wall.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She gives many reasons for this: honor, duty to the aging emperor, setting an example for the troops who regard the Wall as a high and cold punishment. She tells Mushu that she just wants a break, and that the relative calm in the aftermath of Shan Yu\u2019s invasion might give her that. <em>I want time to think,</em> she tells him, and threatens to kick him into Mongolia if he keeps complaining.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The truth is that Mulan doesn\u2019t need any more time to think.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan is tired of thinking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All she thinks about is the future, and the only place that\u2019s as bleak as her future is the top of a stone wall, surrounded by the whitecaps of the mountains and the windswept plains of a barbarous land.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan doesn\u2019t mind the cold because she can wear gloves all day, and not look at the marking scrawled across her palm, a single unbroken line that looks like a child was playing with an inked brush. She knows it says something - the shape is too deliberate, with dips and peaks that couldn\u2019t be accidental - but she also knows that her chances of ever knowing what are diminishing every day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hope is exhausting, and Mulan wants to give up on it for a little while.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She\u2019s been on the wall for a year when Shang comes to inspect her troops.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She\u2019s not worried because she knows they\u2019re the best she can muster; months of inaction on the wall have been turned into months of rigorous drills and training. Mulan pushes them hard and hopes a few will push back, protest her leadership, so she can fight them. Few of them do. The<em> Song of Fa Mulan</em> precedes her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan is uncomfortable without an adversary. When news of Shang\u2019s arrival reaches her, she orders her second to ready the soldiers, and climbs up to the outer brim of the wall, perching on a battlement.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>Nei ho</em>, Mulan.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>Ho</em>, Shang,\u201d she sighs, dropping her chin, caught.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shang sticks his legs through the gap next to her, dropping down on the wall easily and kicking his heels against the stone. Mulan inspects him out of the corner of her eye. \u201cYour men are fit,\u201d he informs her solemnly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shang coughs, discomfitted by her lack of pleasure in his compliment. \u201cI may advise the emperor to send more recruits here. You\u2019ve trained them better than the training camps.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He means this to be a joke, but Mulan only nods. \u201cI am at the emperor\u2019s instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He is silent, for a long time. Almost long enough that Mulan forgets him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIn two years I\u2019ll be thirty.\u201d Mulan inhales sharply, his meaning invading her lungs like a blast of cold wind. Shang, looking down at his hands, rubs his right thumb hard across his left palm, his soulmarked palm.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan knows what it says; she was with him when he found out his match had been killed in the mountains by Shan Yu. He\u2019d fallen to his knees in the sooty snow and cried the way a man was only permitted to cry once, the stiff, cold hand with his name written across it pressed to his forehead. It wasn\u2019t something a person could witness and forget.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIf...\u201d Shang\u2019s voice falters and he shakes his head, his breathing ragged. Mulan wants to reach for him, to steady him, but knows the gesture would be misunderstood within the conversation. Shang\u2019s social awkwardness has always been the best thing about him, to her way of thinking. But she doesn\u2019t want to answer him, and perhaps if he can\u2019t get the question out, then she won\u2019t have to. \u201cIf you wanted me to, I would wait.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are things Mulan should say.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Seven years is a long time,</em> she should tell him. <em>Your debt was repaid long ago</em>, is something else. She should find some way to admit to him that though she can discern nothing about her match from her mark, she\u2019s spent almost half her life in close quarters with men and never once felt attracted to one. She could just say,<em> No, thank you, sir.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan doesn\u2019t say any of those things. \u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She sighs, closes her eyes on the vast empty reaches of Mongolia, and nods.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She stays on the wall for five years, with the spectre of Shang\u2019s proposal hanging over her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A village forms around her barracks, small but not so small that it lacks a brothel. For her twenty-sixth birthday, as a joke, some of the men buy Mulan a bed and a companion. Mulan doesn\u2019t laugh.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hsui-mei has kind eyes and a woman\u2019s name tickled across her palm, and <em>she</em> laughs delightedly at Mulan\u2019s clumsy attempts to express her gratitude. Effortlessly sliding her sweaty, reed-thin limbs into a tangle with Mulan\u2019s, she swoops down for a glowing kiss.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan kisses back and realizes that kissing Shang will never, ever feel so good. A knot of cold dread forms in the pit of her stomach and stays there. She doesn\u2019t go back to the brothel, but sometimes, sitting on the wall with the stars over her head, she aches to.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A promise is a promise, and Shang has already waited three years past his time. It would dishonor them both, to renege.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A month shy of her twenty-eighth year, Mulan goes home to bury her father.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her mother greets her stoically, with a sniff and a weary glance over her body. Mulan feels some part of her collapse, as if she can make her muscles any smaller or her hands any daintier. Two years from an unmatched marriage, and a single glance from a grief-stricken old woman makes her feel like a child being primped for the matchmaker.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She remembers Shang crying in the snow, and some of her anger thaws.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her arms are solid and she knows her mother is grateful for them as she shakes with the sorrow of losing her match.</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the funeral, Mulan goes alone to light a stick of incense for her father.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry Shang,\u201d she murmurs to him softly. \u201cBaba, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Mulan settles into the rhythm of her childhood home - old but new, a familiar place and a familiar body but unfamiliar to each other, ill-matched and unwieldy - a kind of resignation settles over her. She\u2019s the last of the Fa family, and this is her home.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The house is huge and empty, and Mulan paces the edges of it restlessly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In two years, she\u2019ll have to leave it behind and live in the house of the Li family.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s never mentioned, but both occupants of the house are tense with it. Mother cries and moves things, from room to room, she fusses over a place in the outer wall that shows signs of crumbling. When some chickens are killed by a wild dog, she only sighs and shrugs both shoulders down. \u201cDon\u2019t need so many, with only two of us.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulans knows that if she has two sons, maybe, she\u2019ll be able to let her second son inherit it. Her stomach turns over and sours at the idea of even one son, one time in bed with Shang. But she loves her home, and can\u2019t stand the idea of it moldering away, her ancestors weathering and disintegrating. So she might. Might try.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She writes a letter to Shang and hides her concerns amid all the usual generalities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In hindsight she should have expected him to have a solution.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her mother complains about \u2018the boys,\u2019 grumbling about the noise of the drills in the courtyard, the smell of them stumbling past her after they run, but Mulan catches her sneaking them extra pork buns.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She should scold her for coddling them, but truthfully the recruits Shang sent her are too young, too thin, and too unused to kindness. <em>General Fa</em> cannot sneak hardboiled eggs into the folds of their shenyi, or dab strong-smelling salve onto the developing calluses in their palms, or patch holes in their sleeves with quick, secret stitches, however much she might wish to.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The smallest of them can\u2019t be older than twelve, though he lies himself fourteen with conviction, with huge mooncalf eyes in a lantern-like face, and Mulan wants to weep every time she watches him fumble with his g\u00f9n, the fingers of his left hand fighting for the strength to grip the bamboo. The rest of the boys call him Little Brother, and not one unkind word is spoken to him, not even when he fumbles with the laces of his too-big practice armor and it slides off his thin shoulders the first chance it gets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One night, a noise in the courtyard draws her from sleep and she creeps out with a knife in hand to catch the intruder, only to see Little Brother hunched down on the steps with his ruined hand pressed to his chest, biting his other wrist to muffle sobs. Mulan watches her mother settle a blanket and then her arms around him, and presses her own useless mark to her lips, tears welling.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Time passes too quickly. The boys grow tall and strong, sleek and smiling with good cheer and health, and Mother Fa, as they call her, seems to grow taller herself, her shoulders lifted as though the burden of four ill-marked orphan soldier boys is lighter than the air itself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan smiles reflexively through it all, but when she is alone she feels her shoulders drop and her stomach collapse. Bone by bone, she tries to shrink herself down to fit the word \u2018wife.\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Brother is the fastest runner, and even so, when he returns from their morning run to the river before the sun has even fully cleared the horizon Mulan frowns and jogs to meet him at the gate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMessage at the docks,\u201d he gasps, shoving a covered scroll in her direction as he leans over his own knees and coughs with exertion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It isn\u2019t a military message, or a letter from Shang, who uses the military\u2019s couriers for even his personal correspondence, so Mulan takes her time easing the wax seals at the corners. As the rest of the boys pelt into the courtyard behind Little Brother, all of them equally red in the face, she thinks about giving a mild lecture about patience and how the mail is delivered every afternoon by someone whose duty it is to deliver the mail. With four sets of expectant eyes on her, she unrolls the first lines of the missive.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She takes two numb steps backwards and sinks down to sit on the ground, mouth agape.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt\u2019s true! You\u2019re matched!\u201d Deshi blurts, too eager to wait, his wide palms pressed together so hard his arms shake.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mushu snatches the scroll from her and Mulan can\u2019t see through the tears in her eyes to get it back. And then four sets of arms are wrapped around her, and five soldiers are crying with the joy of the impossible.</p>\n<p>\n<span>There are so many things that matter, so many ways this is going to hurt before it heals, but Mulan can\u2019t make herself care over the songbird-beating of her own heart, all of her blood rushing around and singing the news to the rest of her body: we don\u2019t have to be alone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And of course she\u2019s going - Mulan is caught by the need to flee, to run towards her mark with all the urgency of galloping down a mountain ridge ahead of an avalanche. She has to send for the merchant rather than go to him herself, as is proper, afraid that she would simply cut the ship\u2019s ties and order him out to sea.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mother makes tea; Little Brother runs back to the river with a message for Shang, sealed in bright red army wax.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mother shrieks and drops a teapot when Captain Yin points gravely to the name on her palm and says aloud that the name is Elsa, and it belongs to a woman.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan curls her fingers protectively over her palm and avoids eye contact with her mother, jaw tight with the guilt of not telling her the contents of the letter before Yin did. She knows her mother has never imagined anything other than a son-in-law and grandsons, never imagined anything but Shang once Shang was in place.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan knows this because she was so very, very careful to make it seem so.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A mark is a mark, and aware of Little Brother eavesdropping breathlessly from the corridor, Mulan feels her shoulders ease in relief with Mother only sighs and mutters briefly over the hairline fracture in the teapot.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She isn\u2019t at all surprised that Elsa is a woman, but she hangs on the fact that Elsa is a <em>queen</em>. The few times she\u2019d allowed herself the luxury of hope, she\u2019d imagined someone common, and quiet, with a reticent, careful smile that Mulan could spend her entire life trying to earn.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Elsa.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the darkness of her room that night, Mulan says the name quietly, over and over, forcing the difficult sounds out of her teeth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mushu taps the syllables against her forehead: <em>Elllll</em>. <em>Suh</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He himself never quite manages to say it right, but then, it isn\u2019t his soulmate, and there\u2019s a part of Mulan, a very realistic part that speaks with Shang\u2019s baritone logic, that shares his unsubtle reluctance to go so far from what is known. What is even <em>pronounceable</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Elsa</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan\u2019s heart skips beats at nothing more than the <em>possibility</em> of her, and she falls asleep with a kind of thin, grey notion that she\u2019s too old to feel so alive, but also with her hand wrapped around the scroll underneath her pillow.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Restless, she wakes well before dawn and creeps out to the kitchen, stirring the coals until she produces enough heat to make tea. She tucks herself against her father\u2019s favorite cherry tree and watches as the boys stumble sleepily out of the courtyard towards the river.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>I\u2019ve been staring at your name my entire life, but I never knew you existed</em>, is how Elsa\u2019s letter begins, and then apologizes. Mulan smiles and runs her fingers down the words. She knows it isn\u2019t Elsa\u2019s hand - Yin explained how he\u2019d written for her - but she can feel Elsa in them just the same.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe\u2019re going, then.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan glances over at Mushu\u2019s dejected, typically over-dramatic posture and nods, thinning her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to -\u201d She stops and grins when he straightens and pulls a rucksack out from behind the tree and drops a floppy traveler\u2019s hat down on his head.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI know you weren\u2019t about to leave me behind!\u201d he grins toothily.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>No, of course not.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan doesn\u2019t actually tell anyone that she\u2019s going with Yin, but the next thing she knows, her bags are packed and even her ceremonial armor is carefully tucked into its fitted case. Mulan stands in her suddenly emptied room with her hands propped on her hips and panics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cGeneral Fa.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She tugs the corners of her mouth up into a smile before she turns. Little Brother hovers in the door frame, a distinctly greenish cast to his skin. Mulan bites the inside of her mouth against a knee-jerk joke, and waits until his nerves settle and he squares his shoulders, adjusting the bag he has slung across his back.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s a little easier to think about going, when instead of herself, Mulan has to think about if Little Brother remembered to pack both sets of clothing, summer and winter, and if he\u2019s likely to get seasick.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s a little easier to think about Elsa, too, when Little Brother touches her palm tentatively and whispers, \u201cDo you think mine will still recognize me if we find him?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan looks at his beautiful, hopeful little face and presses his ruined palm to hers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is so much easier to believe in another person\u2019s happy ending than her own.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She half expects Shang to ignore her. She doesn\u2019t know where she got that idea, because when has Shang ever been the type to avoid a confrontation, but when his swift little red-sailed riverboat appears down the mountain, Mulan glares at it from the roof and mutters all of the words that she\u2019s not allowed to say on the ground, for fear of her mother overhearing.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cDamn it, Ping.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She expects the angry scowl, and the haunted, oblique eyebrows, and even the use of her snot-nosed, inept-teenager name. What she doesn\u2019t expect is the sudden, roguish grin and the startlingly tight grip around her shoulders.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThis is the last thing in the world you should apologize for,\u201d he murmurs gravely into her hair, and Mulan presses closer into his chest, a sob bubbling up her throat and turning into a laugh.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shang stays for dinner, and calls Mulan\u2019s mother his own, and the boys his men, and the tight, snapping band around her ribcage lets go, and there aren\u2019t as many tears as she expects, when she and Mushu and Little Brother tramp onto the deck of Yin\u2019s ship.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deshi holds Mother up with a strong arm around her waist, his face a careful study in stoicism as he refuses to wave. Little Brother\u2019s pockets are stuffed full of sweetbuns and preserved eggs and his smile is brighter and more fragile than Mulan has ever seen. She holds her breath but he doesn\u2019t start crying until they\u2019ve rounded the bend, and then it\u2019s okay that she joins him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After all her concern for Little Brother, of course it\u2019s Mulan who is so seasick she can barely move for two weeks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By the time she manages to stand at the rail (and not bend over it with her stomach roiling), the mainland is a dark line between the sea and the sky, and on the other side, faint blue-green wisps of island flit like mirages.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThose are the Nansha,\u201d Little Brother nods out at the horizon. \u201cThey\u2019re easier to see from the top of the mast. Maybe Xiao Tai will let you borrow his looking glass.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wary of moving her head too quickly, Mulan studies her young charge out of the corner of her eye. In two weeks, he\u2019s shed his shenyi and begun acquiring a dark tan. His bare toes splay confidently on the boards. She cants her head up and eyes the main mast, a long, straight span of wood so familiar it makes her grin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Brother grins back, miming the wristlock necessary to climb. \u201cXiao Tai says I\u2019m the fastest climber he\u2019s ever seen. I said that\u2019s cause he\u2019s never seen you climb.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>Challenge accepted.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every time she thinks about asking, her seasickness threatens to return. To distract herself, Mulan learns rigging, and knots, and starts teaching Little Brother how to shoot a recurve bow by tying a string to his arrows and pointing him towards the water.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He proves surprisingly adept, his injured hand able to lock in place around the bow and hold steady for hours. The sailors take to calling him Little Hook, for the shape of his hand, and for the first time Mulan sees the shadow of his deformity lift away. He scrambles over every inch of the ship without falter, his grin as wide as the crescent moon.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cDid you know most of the men are lost marks, like me?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan shifts her weight, testing the strength of the rope wrapped around her foot before she turns to face him. He\u2019s crouched easily on the top of the mast, as relaxed as Mulan would be on the ground.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She hadn\u2019t known, but it didn\u2019t surprise her. Those without good marks tended to be pushed to the edges, and the daring, windswept freedom of the sea, months and years away from China, was about as far from center as possible.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Brother lets his words sit for a long time, a little bone knife whittling away at his fingernails. \u201cExcept Xiao Tai and the captain, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan nods, <em>of course</em>, and only later when she looks at Yin\u2019s mark does she realize what she\u2019s agreeing about.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIs she pretty?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The question is blurted and artless and Mulan wants to snatch it back out of the air, but she\u2019s been trying to ask what Elsa looks like for almost a month now, and she and Yin have been standing alone at the helm for hours, Yin steering idly with one hand and pointing out the important stars with the other.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yin\u2019s eyebrows lift, but he smiles knowingly before considering her question. \u201cThin,\u201d he replies after a moment. \u201cShe is thin and pale, and her eyes are very large.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan squints and tries to decide if his tone is positive or negative.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not that it matters what Elsa looks like, Mulan tells herself firmly. Marks always know.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Besides, she isn\u2019t exactly a prize catch herself.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Singapore, amid the flurry of trade and the sudden influx of exotic fruits (one of which smells so foul that Mulan for the first time ever asserts her imperial rank and forbids the sailors from bringing it below deck), a man with large eyes and a thin black mustache joins them. He looks Mulan up and down and laughs. \u201cSo you are the little queen\u2019s mark.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan scowls at his tone and is seconds away from pitching him over the side into the impossibly clean waters of Singapore\u2019s port when he sweeps his feathered hat off his head and bows deeply.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI am Stefano. I am your translator.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>What. An. Idiot.</em>\u201d Mulan stifles her laughter in her hand and shoves Mushu\u2019s head back into her collar.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the waters between Singapore and Yindu, Mulan learns how to say hello to Elsa, how to talk pleasantly about nothing, and how to ask her about the weather. Stefano thinks this is hilarious.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan doesn\u2019t want to ask too many questions about Elsa. She wants to learn her for herself, puzzle out all the pieces of her life, discover bit by bit why this woman, out of all possible women in the world, is the one she\u2019s made for.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But she hears things.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most of the crew has seen her, after all, and from the fairy tales they spin Mulan begins to wonder if she\u2019s real. She says as much to Little Brother, who laughs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHonored Fa,\u201d he chortles. \u201cYou have a <em>dragon</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She supposes he has a point.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They sail around the tip of Yindu without stopping. Mulan asks why - the hold is keening with trade goods, and they are close enough that she catches glimpses of buildings from the top of the mast - and the men go strangely silent.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThere\u2019s a religion,\u201d Stefano finally answers, speaking in slow English so Mulan can understand him and the sailors can ignore him. \u201cPoor bastards believe that they\u2019re supposed to refuse their soulmates.\u201d He shivers and gestured over himself. Mulan squints at his gloved hand, wondering.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s ever heard of someone refusing their mark. But there\u2019s something especially chilling about the idea of a whole group of people doing it. She swallows her discomfort, not wanting to judge something she doesn\u2019t understand. The men have no such qualms and speak loudly. She watches the pleasant-looking people through the looking glass, and wonders if their lives are like the one she would be living if she had stayed in China.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their water supplies have dwindled to only the foulest rotgut alcohol by the time they reach Goa, and Mulan feels her nausea threatening at the choppy seas. Six of the sailors they began the journey with leave for another vessel, returning to China, and they hire on replacements. Mulan stares at their skin and faces as surreptitiously as she can.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She wonders, again, what Elsa looks like.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>Feizhou</em>.\u201d Yin joins her at the helm - he\u2019s trusted her to pilot since she lashed herself to the wheel during a storm and by all accounts kept them from capsizing - and gestures out at the distant, approaching coast.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan frowns, not overly fond of the name. Two of the sailors they hired in Goa are so dark they make the sunbaked Chinese sailors look wan, and she understands that they call the landmass\u00a0<em>Alkebulan</em>. The word Stefano teaches her is <em>Africa</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As they wend their way all the way around the continent, Mulan stops thinking of the new crew as at all different in appearance, and she can speak comfortably to all of them in English.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They\u2019ve been chasing the rumors of pirates since Cape Town. Little Brother catches onto the romance of the tales and won\u2019t let go, fashioning a sash out of a red shenyi with a tear in it and begging the sailors (some of whom, Mulan suspects, have first hand knowledge) for pirate tales. His English broadens, becomes a swaggery accented pidgin with scatterings of other languages, and he pesters Mulan until she agrees to resume combat training with him on the deck, adapting duandao techniques to the short, curved blade an indulgent sailor named Smee loses on purpose in a game of cards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Still, she isn\u2019t prepared to actually meet them.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Brother speaks first, after looking through the glass for almost a full minute.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh,\u201d he says quietly. Mulan watches as he works the disappointment off his face and his shoulders lift with purpose. He pulls his fishing bow from his back sheath and strings it calmly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan nods to Yin, and Xiao Tai adjusts the sails.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cReady, Mushu?\u201d she murmurs, one hand braced against the mast and the other clutching a rope. Mushu rumbles with anticipation, wrapped tightly around the sash of firepots across Mulan\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan might have never seen anything like the women the pirates had tangled in their nets, but the pirates had certainly never seen anything like Mulan, soaring down on their ship raining bombs. They\u2019re cowering by the time the rest of the crew boards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan tells Little Brother to supervise their surrender, which he does with a nocked arrow and an iron voice years older than he is, and she climbs over the side to make sure the women all managed to get free of the nets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One with dark hair still has her tail impossibly tangled, and a fretting red-head tugging ineffectually with her bare hands, heedless of Mulan\u2019s approach. \u201cHere, let me,\u201d she offers, wrapping her wrist in the net for stability and drawing her boot knife.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their eyes are wide with fear but Mulan moves slowly and takes great pains to avoid nicking the... well, so it feels exactly like an ordinary fish\u2019s tail and Mulan isn\u2019t going to think too hard about it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She is nearly finished when the red-head swims closer and tugs her left hand open with a squeak, shoving her own palm forward so quickly she bumps Mulan\u2019s nose. Mulan looks as soon as her eyes stop watering and blinks in recognition. Their marks share the first letter of their names. She sounds out the name on the girl\u2019s hand for her, slowly, and finishes cutting the net open to a chorus of it, the waters rolling as she swims in an excited circle.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The darker girl rolls her eyes in aggravation and swims closer to Mulan, looping her arm around Mulan\u2019s neck and planting a kiss on her lips before Mulan can rally a defense. \u201cThank you, human,\u201d she lilts gravely, and then pulls the younger one behind her, under the surface.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan shakes off her shock before she sinks, and uses the net to climb back onto the pirate ship.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the hold of the ship, they find a scrawny boy with hair the color of sand and a bruise purpling his eye, and when he reaches out to take a flask of water from Smee, Little Brother goes absolutely still, staring at his hand.</p>\n<p>His name is Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan sleeps that night with her back to the fore mast, her head tipped back so that every time she blinks her eyes awake she can see the stars. A whisper of sound next to her startles Mushu awake with a hiss and a hiccup of fire; Little Brother murmurs quietly to him and pinches out the ember spot on Mulan\u2019s sleeve.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan considers pretending to sleep, but Little Brother knows her better than that.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAll right?\u201d she asks, quietly enough that he can ignore her, if he wishes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He settles with his back to the mast, his shoulder bumped into hers and his cutlass across his lap, and Mulan waits. He opens his mouth to speak and his voice cracks. Mulan shifts, then, poking Mushu to get him to stop making faces, and looks down at Little Brother\u2019s hand, crooked fingers running back and forth along the nicked edge. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d A hard swallow.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eyes misting, Mulan hesitates before gently smoothing down his salty, flyaway hair. He stiffens but leans imperceptibly into the touch. She presses her palm into his shoulder and breathes in time with him, wishing that Little Brother needed her to explain the ways that the world could be damaging. Everything about the set of his jaw is entirely too old.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan watches the horizon behind them with a mouthful of cotton, waiting to regret her decision to scuttle the pirates on a sandbar instead of killing them, but after days of strong winds and no signs of pursuit, even Xiao Tai stops glaring at her from his periphery.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She waits for Little Brother to ask for help without knowing at all what to do, only that she sleeps sitting upright on the deck with her arm around him, and they listen to the sound of Peter\u2019s night terrors echoing from her surrendered cabin like a particularly brutal lullaby.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes she wakes up shaken with the force of Little Brother\u2019s tears.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the daylight, everything in his face begs her not to say anything.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt was all supposed to get easier once I found him.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Brother loses arrow after arrow with fouled shots at canny, circling seabirds, but they aren\u2019t at war, and there\u2019s no enemy to point him to instead, and Mulan can\u2019t think of a thing to say.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cGeneral Fa.\u201d Yin speaks quietly and won\u2019t make eye contact. \u201cThe men are not sleeping.\u201d Mulan feels her own sleep-starved eyes aching in the bright sun, and thins her lips against an uncharacteristically sharp retort. Undeterred by her silence, Yin continues. \u201cSomething must be done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For all that Little Brother\u2019s name stands out in bold, sure brushstrokes on his hand, Peter\u2019s huge blue eyes and serious dark eyebrows unnerve her, the quick, flitting changes of expression on his face and how hard she has to work to keep from remembering the sound of his wailing, choking nightmares as he stands defiantly in the cabin, a green shenyi belted incorrectly around his too thin torso. \u201cYou don\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cGood.\u201d All the same, she hangs in the doorway and tries to think herself quiet and unthreatening. \u201cI promise you, no one here is trying to scare you.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sneer on his face is harsh and ugly and Mulan tries to remember that it isn\u2019t for her. She feels lead-footed and inept, and is painfully aware of Little Brother, leaning his back against the wall just outside the door, biting down on the meat of his thumb to keep from making noise. Mushu leaves her shirtsleeve to wrap around him like a scarf, an uncharacteristically kind emotion in the gesture.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, Peter has begun shouting for her, for everyone, to go away. Mulan blinks at him and waits. That\u2019s when she knows it will feel different, when it\u2019s her soulmark, because in his lifetime Little Brother has been rejected far more harshly, and with far more finality, and he jerks like arrows are smashing into his ribs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She waits for Peter to stop yelling, and leaves him standing there with his fists creaking around his pain. Little Brother peers around the doorway with one eye, and Mulan glances back just in time to see something in Peter\u2019s face crack, just for a second, and then the boy wails and throws the door shut.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Outside the wind is howling with the approach of a storm. Mulan wraps her arms around Little Brother\u2019s thin waist to keep him anchored to the deck as he screams his pain into the tempestuous sky and she thinks, selfishly, what if Elsa doesn\u2019t want her?</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The storm rages for long enough that Mulan loses track of night and day under the dark clouds, and she lashes herself to the rail and gives up the fight with her stomach. In a brief moment of clarity, she decides that the next time she hears a song about the glory of the sea, she\u2019ll start a fight so epic they\u2019ll sing songs about it, instead.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>Cabo Verde</em>,\u201d Stefano pronounces the unfamiliar words with more flourish than she\u2019s used to, and greets the docksmen in a string of words she recognizes as some of the argot used in every port since they began sailing north.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stefano melts into the crowded port the second he steps off the dock, but luckily Little Brother has gleaned enough of the language to remember the word <em>medico</em>, and they follow pointing vendors along sandy streets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Peter is different on shore. Little Brother watches with wide eyes as he smiles for the first time at the antics of a street performer\u2019s monkey, a bold, rakhish arc that even he seems startled by. Mulan buys three of the brightest fruits she sees, and every part of her mouth seems to spring to life at the crunch and sweetness. Peter has eaten his down to pips by the time she takes her second bite. Little Brother offers his and when their fingers brush, Peter doesn\u2019t flinch.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She expects it, when Little Brother brings it up while Peter is with the elderly doctor, but it doesn\u2019t make her any less nauseous.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMother would kill me,\u201d she says shortly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mother is oceans away, and Little Brother\u2019s spine is straight and his eyes so clear with purpose that Mulan feels brave just looking at him. That night Mulan volunteers for watch and sits atop a pylon on the dock. When the sun rises, a rucksack thumps onto the dock.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan edges her toe down against the saltlocked rope and leans down to meet Smee\u2019s bespectacled gaze. He seems about to speak, but balks at the last minute, pulling his glasses off and wiping at his sleep-crusted eyes to buy time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan\u2019s frustration is an inert, silent thing, like a too-large mouthful of wine her body is fighting to spit out. At length, Smee unwraps the dirty linen around his left hand and holds his palm up for inspection. And it\u2019s not that she really cares who his mark is, but she understands it\u2019s a sign of trust, showing someone, so Mulan swallows her growing ire to lean down and look closely.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Only two lines, crossing in the middle. A bad mark, people back home would say. Smee sighs away the look of pity Mulan doesn\u2019t work hard enough to hide, and rewraps his hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou\u2019ll - \u201d Mulan chokes and stops, closes her eyes against tears. So, so grateful. So, so angry.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cLike he\u2019s me own son,\u201d Smee answers gruffly, clearing his throat and looking away.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She can\u2019t bring herself to give Little Brother her blessing, but she does give him enough coin to gain his footing.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s two days before she notices that Stefano never got back on the ship at Cabo Verde, and only because Yin brings it up while she watches a set of distant ships through the looking glass.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the course of the day, the shape of the sails come into focus, until Xiao Tai shouts out his recognition and the crew springs into action. Their ship is lighter and swifter, and soon the pirates shrink below the horizon again. Mulan protests, but Yin for once pulls rank and tells her to stick to land strategy.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It gets cold as they push north, no longer at leisure, and the one morning Mulan wakes up to a view of a distant shore that carves in and out like the teeth of a monster, and Yin points her to a whitecapped mountain and says, \u201cArendelle.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan\u2019s stomach heaves once before she can force herself to stillness, Yin\u2019s hand resting lightly on her shoulder. He squeezes comfortingly and Mulan breathes until she knows for sure she\u2019s trembling from the cold.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Xiao Tai runs a flag up the mast as they edge closer, a white with a red dragon\u2019s face stitched onto it. Mushu preens. \u201cThank you,\u201d Mulan says as Xiao Tai lands lightly on the deck, but he only nods.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHonored Fa,\u201d he begins gravely, and Mulan frowns, trying to recall if he\u2019d ever addressed her as such. \u201cLittle Hook asked me to remind you that you defeated Shan Yu, and he was much larger than Queen Elsa.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan laughs in spite of herself.</p>\n<p>\n<br><br><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She sees Elsa from the deck, as the sailors are tying off the pylons, and she <em>feels</em> it, in the pit of her stomach, before Yin points her out, before anyone else, she looks at the woman sweeping imperiously towards the dock and she <em>knows</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Only Mushu hears her quiet curse, and for once he doesn\u2019t laugh.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Yin shoves her lead-footed self off the ship, she stumbles, unable to take her eyes off of Elsa as the same recognition dawns on her, her body stiffening and stalling, her mouth dropping open.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are other people in the world. There are other people looking at her right now.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan sees none of them, hears none of them beyond the rushing of blood through her ears. She misses the first words her soulmark says.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cElsa,\u201d the woman says, her voice light and edged, \u201cI\u2019m Elsa.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan can only agree, of course you are, looking at the faint blush spreading across pale cheeks, at the wide-blown pupils dominating incredibly blue eyes. Her hands buzz with a need they\u2019ve never encountered before, and she holds herself still against it, struggles for composure and manners. Elsa is so pale, and she trembles like a leaf, and Mulan knows better, she does. \u201cI am Fa Mulan.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s so hard to break eye contact with Elsa, but she has to or risk... something, Mulan doesn\u2019t know what to do and isn\u2019t altogether sure Elsa is even happy to see her, and there\u2019s a little figure made out of snow that chirps at her cheerfully. Mulan can\u2019t help but look back at Elsa, realizing the men really weren\u2019t just talk, and Elsa seems to forget the situation for a moment, shrugging sheepishly with a little bit of a proud smile on her lips. She doesn\u2019t look real, any more than the snowman - <em>Olaf</em> - looks real, but he is solid in her arms as Mulan obediently hugs him and so Elsa must be as well.</p>\n<p>\n<span>All of the color seems to have drained out of Elsa\u2019s face, save for a flush creeping up her slim throat, and Mulan so expects her to faint that she springs forward to catch her even with Mushu\u2019s claws digging into her shoulder at the sight of the other dragon. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone around her seems to think she needs an apology, for Elsa, but Mulan has never felt more grounded or necessary as she does when she has Elsa in her arms, because <em>of course</em> she needed to be this strong, so that she can cradle her soulmate without any effort.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The woman with red hair - <em>Anna</em>, she's Elsa\u2019s sister, Mulan knows she should remember this - calls for assistance, but Mulan shakes her head and tightens her grip. Elsa\u2019s head lolls against her collarbones, her eyelashes fluttering against Mulan\u2019s bare skin so that she almost does drop her, after all.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou just - you have to be careful,\u201d Anna frets, and the way she moves Elsa\u2019s hands away from Mulan\u2019s chest makes her wonder, briefly, if Anna doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s afraid Mulan with drop the queen.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anna wants to stay until Elsa wakes, but the bundle of blankets in her arms starts crying and once she\u2019s gone, Olaf grins and squeezes Mulan\u2019s hand. The little sticks that make up his fingers are pliable and almost warm.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cShe\u2019s shy,\u201d he whispers to her conspiratorially. \u201cBut she\u2019s not very hard to love.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He\u2019s not wrong. Elsa is bright and skittish and fleeting and awkward and stubborn and somehow the most wonderful creature Mulan has ever seen. Mulan loves her helplessly, a ship caught in a reckless and swift current, and she holds her breath and runs aground again and again on the rocks of Elsa\u2019s fragile, tenuous grasp on social interaction.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She meets Kristoff, and discovers that the baby is Hilde, Elsa\u2019s niece and heir, and this little soulbound family is so overwhelmingly warm and easy to interact with that Mulan finds herself thinking <em>well, no wonder Elsa is hiding.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Mulan knows how to be patient but Kristoff is terrible at w\u00e9iq\u00ed, and Anna refuses to even attempt to play. \u201cElsa would understand this,\u201d she grouses, unpeeling a stone from Hilde\u2019s hand and placing it back on the board. \u201cShe\u2019s great at chess.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She realizes what she\u2019s said, and scrambles to apologize, but Mulan isn\u2019t quite able to keep the stricken look off her face.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She is alone in her room, restlessly polishing her ceremonial armor - there are pocks in it where the salt air crept through the seals, and she\u2019ll have to have it repaired - when the temperature dips, and she looks over at her dressing table in time to watch a thin band of white-cold air creep up and begin to twist around itself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her armor clatters to the floor and she crosses the distance blindly, watching as the frost collects into a single, achingly perfect rose. Mulan has never understood romance, but her heart thrashes in her chest and she feels as weak as she\u2019s ever been and when she picks it up it doesn\u2019t even feel cold.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Elsa still flinches at the sight of her, Mulan clenches her jaw and assumes it\u2019s the same reason her mother always flinched. Too big, too frightening, too like a man. It takes all of her courage to say something, but she looks up at Elsa\u2019s response and watches as Elsa\u2019s hands fidget with fear and the ice crackles the sound of her anxiety into the room.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>I am Fa Mulan.</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She watches as, like lightning, a flash of <em>want</em> passes through Elsa\u2019s eyes. Suddenly she understands so much, and she wants to laugh at herself, at Elsa, at the world, and especially at the way Elsa trembles and tips forward to be kissed without even meaning to, because all this time she\u2019s been thinking Elsa didn\u2019t want her.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At dinner Elsa has a shy smile for her, and because Mulan is watching she sees the way her eyes flit down to her lips and then linger on her hands; Mulan feels her breath catch as a blush creeps across her pale cheeks because this means Elsa <em>knows</em>, now. Little spiderwebs of frost cover her cutlery when she lifts it, and Mulan feels like jumping out of her skin with happiness.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It seems only natural that the pirates would choose that moment to arrive in force. Mulan looks at their formation, their cannons all facing the castle, and feels shame burn at her face. She shouldn\u2019t have let Yin talk her out of engaging them. Elsa and Arendelle are in danger, now, and it\u2019s her fault. Mulan squares her shoulders and prepares to to the right thing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Elsa who stops her is a revelation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly she understands all of the rumors, all of the things she\u2019d dismissed as legend.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa is tall and imposing and impossibly beautiful, all of the lines of her face sharp and proud and vengeful and Mulan can only gape as with a high, triumphant laugh all of Arendelle goes white and still. The freezing, breaking pirate fleet ceases to matter as all of Mulan\u2019s focus centers on Elsa, who closes her palms and <em>smirks</em> at Mulan, an expression of canny, reckless lust that hits Mulan right in the pit of her stomach</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mulan\u2019s knees actually give out, for the first time in her entire life, and she kneels on the cold flagstones. Elsa strides forward, limbs lax with confidence, and reaches down to cup Mulan\u2019s jaw with both hands, pulling her up easily.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>I am the Snow Queen</em>,\u201d she says proudly, her breath a sharp puff of frost against Mulan\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And even though she\u2019s come so close, she hesitates, and Mulan knows, and she breaks out of her slack-jawed paralysis to grin and circle Elsa\u2019s waist with one arm, threading her free hand through frost-covered hair, thumb brushing into the hollow behind Elsa\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsa the Snow Queen shivers all the way to her toes, and Mulan can barely stop grinning in time to match the press of cold lips with her own. Ice crackles down her spine and against her eyelashes, but Mulan only presses closer and Elsa sinks down with a quiet groan, her slim fingers tightening against Mulan\u2019s collar.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span></span><br>\n<br>\n</p>"
