  "summary": "<p>Vecna is dead. It's the summer after the party's freshman year. Steve Harrington spends it in the Family Video Store, and Eddie Munson is spending post-graduate life bothering him. And maybe Steve isn't as bothered as he used to be.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>note: i'm notorious for not finishing fics, so no promises about this one.</p>\n<p>btw, if the duffer brothers kill either of my boys i will be living in this universe i created and there's nothing anyone can do to stop me</p>\n<p>btw wanted to say thank u to the person who reminded me Steve actually did admit to smoking weed in season 3! for the purposes of the story we're gonna pretend he didn't say that lmao, and that this is his first time. </p>\n<p>also thank u for all the kind comments! if i don't respond know that i still read them all and appreciate every one! and even if ur not commenting, i appreciate u taking the time to read! </p>\n<p>also, also-- i've written essentially all of this to basically the same Wallows EP on repeat (except for the first chapter, which i wrote to my oldie's playlist lol.) Wallows obviously isn't a band from the 80's, but their Remote EP really captures the ~vibes~ of this fic. or at least, it does to me, and maybe u! figured i'd throw it out there. </p>\n<p>anyway, hope u enjoy! little bit longer of a chapter than usual :)</p>\n<p>heyyy. so first off, i know the 'see something say something' campaign didn't happen until 2001, but lets pretend it existed before then in this universe, bc it was funny-ish and i said so. </p>\n<p>secondly, i have good news and bad news. the good news? this will be my first ever finished fic! the bad news? There's only two more chapters left, and one is an epilogue. im actually rlly sad to be drawing this fic to a close, i feel like i could write in it forever, but i love this fic a lot and wanna do it the justice of giving it a proper ending. as of right now, and maybe im biased bc it's my first ever finished fic, it's my favorite fic ever written, and im honestly not sure if i'll do better than this. but thats ok! to create something that not only i enjoy so much, but that a lot of yall did too is something pretty spectacular! </p>\n<p>thirdly, i have the inkling of an idea for another steddie fic. probably shorter than this, similar concept but not set in the same universe as this fic. it would be from eddie's pov, and while their dynamic would be similar, it would be tweaked just a bit to explore different sides of their characters that i didn't really lean into in this one. (ie, eddie's shyer side, and steve's more confident jock one.) and there would probably be more angst. honestly this is the first fic i've written with barely-- if any-- angst.<br>so if that sounds like somethin ur interested in, keep an eye out after this fic is done :D</p>\n<p>thank u again for all the wonderful comments and support! as of right now we're at roughly 800 kudos with a bit over 6000 hits, which is absolutely insane to think that many people laid eyes on something i made-- and a good amount liked it! thats crazy, even tho it might not be a lot to some ppl, actually trying to fathom that many ppl reading something i wrote is... practically not possible haha. so thank u again!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>this was the final chapter, but don't worry! there's an epilogue coming probably tomorrow. it will likely be a little shorter than the other chapters, however.</p>\n<p>i'll say more on the actual final update on this fic, but for now, thank yall so much for supporting, no matter what way u did! the day of posting this we broke a little over a thousand kudos, and thats pretty wild! and ofc, thank u all for the super nice comments, yall are too sweet. seriously, some of u really supersized my ego haha. even if i didn't respond i read all of them, and they meant a lot!<br>i hope u enjoyed the last full length update!</p>\n<p>main edit: the angsty Eddie POV fic is out btw! it's called 'Keep it Steady, Eddie.' Once more for clarification; it is NOT a continuation of this fic, or an alternate POV to this fic</p>\n<p>little edit: i've gotten a few ppl asking if they can draw fanart so i just wanted to say absolutely! pls give credit to the fic if u dont mind, but other than that draw to ur hearts content! and if ur comfortable, drop a comment with where to find it so I-- and anyone else who enjoyed the fic-- can see it! i'd love to see what yall come up with :D</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>and that's the end! thank yall so much for all of your support and sharing your thoughts on the story so far. i wrote the first few chapters of this as a character study just to see if i could match their vibes, and didn't think i was gonna post it at all. but im so glad i did! yall have made writing this story somethin really special, &amp; i cant thank you enough! </p>\n<p>if you're interested in a slightly angsty eddie-pov fic, i'll likely be starting it soon after this one. to be clear: it wont be a continuation of this fic, and will be completely unconnected to this one. a fresh start so i can explore different sides of their characters, basically.<br>but until then, i hope you enjoyed this fic, and a little epilogue where we got some wholesome group-dynamic content.<br>thanks again :) &lt;3</p>",
  "text": "<p>The bell above the door to the Family Video Store jingled, catching Steve\u2019s attention from where he leaned over the register counter, flipping through a magazine. His eyes flicked up, an unamused scowl twitching his lips as his eyes rested on Eddie Munson.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin\u2019s home sick, Munson,\u201d He supplied dully, turning his attention back to the magazine. Eddie had been coming in more and more recently, mostly to hang out with Robin, but Steve swore he was also doing it just to annoy him.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, because I\u2019m only allowed in here under her supervision,\u201d Eddie said humorously, and another glance up at him revealed that irritating smirk paired with those deep brown eyes that always seemed to bore holes right through you. Steve gave a small shake of his head, once again busying himself with the magazine. \u201cOh, c\u2019mon Harrington,\u201d Eddie scoffed, leisurely walking around the store, fingertips grazing the tapes as he walked by. \u201cWe helped save the world together, and you still act like you barely know me.\u201d Steve didn\u2019t need to look up this time to see the ever-present smirk, instead he let out a huff. </p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>do</em> barely know you.\u201d Another glance up, Eddie no longer looking at Steve but inspecting some of the horror movies. \u201cI\u2019ve seen more of you these past months than I did when we were saving the world. And ya know, at first I thought it was just because you and Robin are friends, but now I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s because you like bothering me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Eddie turned to catch Steve\u2019s eyes, an infuriating smile twitching his lips. \u201cWhat if I do? If you don\u2019t want me coming around, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be so fun to bother.\u201d Eddie gave a quick raise of his eyebrows, before turning back to the tapes. \u201cBesides. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re ever busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em>frequently</em> in here when we\u2019re busy. And that doesn\u2019t stop you from pretending like you need to ask me a million questions while I\u2019m trying to help actual paying customers. Speaking of which,\u201d Steve fixed him with a look. \u201cIf you don\u2019t plan on being one, why don\u2019t you go bother Dustin instead. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d appreciate it a lot more than me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie turned to Steve and put a hand over his heart, face and tone feigning offense. \u201cI am <em>browsing</em> this fine establishment. How am I to know if any of your wares will catch my eye?\u201d Steve stared flatly back at him, Eddie\u2019s smile widening briefly. \u201cBesides, Dustin and the rest of the little gremlins are busy. He\u2019s got some broadcast date with Suzie, Lucas and Max are doing whatever soon-to-be-sophomores call a date, and the Wheeler kid\u2013 well, I\u2019m sure you know the Wheeler kids are in California helping the Byers move back.\u201d Eddie waggled his eyebrows at Steve, who groaned and rolled his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cWill you let that go? I told you, me and Nance just got a little caught up in the whole\u2026\u201d Steve flapped a hand around dismissively. \u201cSaving the world. She\u2019s still very much in love with Jonathan, hence why she\u2019s in California right now.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie shrugged. \u201cWhatever you say, man,\u201d he didn\u2019t sound convinced. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, your only friends besides Robin are\u2026 a bunch of sophomores? Aren\u2019t you like, twenty dude?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking, Harrington, who last time I checked <em>also</em> only had kids as friends. Besides Robin, of course,\u201d Eddie glanced him up and down. \u201cAnd Ms. California-Boyfriend.\u201d Steve made a face, unable to come up with a retort as it was, much to his chagrin, a fair point. \u201cPlus, I do have other friends.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right. The band,\u201d Steve said disinterestedly, flipping the page of his magazine and trying to get distracted enough in whatever pointless celebrity gossip was in it to ignore Eddie. \u201cGo bother them, then.\u201d Two leather-clad forearms folded onto the counter in front of him, and looking up revealed Eddie leaning on the counter, chin in hand as he regarded Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cYa know, Stevie,\u201d Steve grimaced at the nickname. \u201cRobin is quite fond of both of us, and it would behoove us\u2013\u201d Steve mouthed the word \u2018behoove\u2019 with furrowed brows, but Eddie continued. \u201cTo get along. Neither of us are going anywhere.\u201d Eddie looked around the Family Video Store, muttering more to himself than Steve \u201cClearly.\u201d Steve watched as an unknown thought seemed to occupy Eddie\u2019s mind, before just as quickly as it came it snapped away, the goofy demeanor back in firm place as his eyes fell onto Steve again. \u201cBesides. We saved each other\u2019s lives more than once, afterall.\u201d With that, he knocked twice on the counter and pushed himself off, meandering his way to the door. \u201cSee ya, Harrington.\u201d And with a lazy wave over his shoulder, the bell dinged once more as Eddie exited the video store. Steve\u2019s eyes lingered where the boy had just stood for a moment before snapping out of whatever stupor he had fallen into. </p>\n<p>+ + +</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so important that I come with you to some stupid party.\u201d Steve groaned as he walked next to Robin. The party was miraculously within walking distance from Robin\u2019s house, so Steve was leaving his car parked in her driveway, determined to at least not be stuck as designated driver. Especially since he didn\u2019t even wanna go to this thing in the first place. \u201cYou said Munson was going, so you don\u2019t even need me there anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize how weird it is that <em>I</em> am convincing you, Steve Harrington, the value of partying and being social.\u201d Robin lolled her head to one side, giving Steve an almost reprimansive look.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. I\u2019ve done enough partying to justify staying in for the rest of my life. So can I go home now?\u201d Robin sighed, a surprisingly serious demeanor washing over her as she turned her attention forward, puzzling Steve. He furrowed his brows at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Steve, have you, though?\u201d She looked back at Steve. \u201cSince Will went missing and you got caught up in all that\u2026 shit? You definitely haven\u2019t partied since I\u2019ve known you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well. Partying doesn\u2019t seem so important in light of other things.\u201d Steve spoke quietly, focusing more on his shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point exactly. I mean\u2026 Vecna\u2019s been dead for a while. It\u2019s time to loosen up just a little.\u201d Robin clapped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou can take a break from being a babysitter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve let out a long exhale, shaking his head a bit. \u201cI dunno, Robin. You couldn\u2019t believe it was back after Starcourt, meanwhile I\u2019ve been consistently surprised it\u2019s been coming back since we killed the first round of demogorgons. I don\u2019t think I know how to loosen up anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou being on edge isn\u2019t going to make it any less likely to come back, Steve,\u201d Robin grabbed his sleeve and tugged him to a gentle stop. \u201cIt\u2019s just gonna leave you more burnt out in the event it <em>does</em> come back. Keep your mind open to the possibility so you don\u2019t overlook signs, sure, but going to <em>one party</em> isn\u2019t going to determine whether or not some interdimensional demon tries to destroy Hawkins.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve gave Robin a long, debating look. He knew she was right, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier. He worried his bottom lip beneath his teeth, looking down the road where he could see people gathering around a house.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said finally, resuming the walk once more, Robin in quick tow, a smile stretched onto her face. \u201cBut I\u2019m leaving early and making Munson drive you home if it\u2019s lame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>As they reached the end of the driveway, synthy pop music warbled out from inside the multi-storied house, people milling about or filing in and out. It was already in full swing, the two arriving later due to having to convince Steve. </p>\n<p>They were immediately met with a wall of muggy heat, the combined temperature of people dancing and drinking leaving the air thick and humid compared to the light chill on the summer night outside. Steve led them past the room where the music was loudest, filled with people dancing, and straight to the kitchen, brushing past other partygoers as they went. He\u2019d never been to this house before, but it was easy enough to find all the alcohol, bottles and cans piled high on the large island in the middle of the kitchen. </p>\n<p>Steve grabbed two solo cups, passing one to Robin as he began mixing them two drinks. He didn\u2019t know much about drink making besides pouring alcohol in the bottom and enough soda or punch to make it tolerable, but Robin didn\u2019t yack immediately upon sipping it, so he called it a win. Robin led them to the dance room, filing to the side where there was seating.</p>\n<p>He and Robin took a seat on one of the couches, Steve starting on his drink. \u201cSee? Not so bad.\u201d Robin commented, Steve shrugging. A party was a party. He wasn\u2019t miserable, but he certainly didn\u2019t have the same enthusiasm he used to about the things. Now just to get drunk enough to make Eddie Munson tolerable. </p>\n<p>And, almost as if on cue, a figure walked up next to Steve. He looked up at Eddie, raising his eyebrows in the faintest motion of acknowledgement as he took a long sip of his drink. </p>\n<p>\u201cEddie! You came.\u201d Robin stood up to hug her friend, who returned it gladly, both of them careful not to spill their drinks. \u201cGood. Maybe you can get Steve to loosen up.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie scoffed. \u201cNot likely. I tend to have the opposite effect on him,\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyes fell to Steve. \u201cDon\u2019t I, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s not your intention.\u201d Steve said back flatly. Eddie smiled amusedly down at him, a teasing waggle of his eyebrows as he took a sip of his own drink. Steve took in his appearance, slightly different from usual. He ditched his leather jacket, but kept his usual denim vest, a tight band tee underneath. He still wore his usual chains and accessories, which Steve thought pointless functionally, but supposed it did make him look\u2026 decent. This wardrobe change showed off his unexpectedly sculpted arms, which had shocked Steve the first time he noticed; sometime during their time fighting Vecna. Eddie didn\u2019t strike Steve as the kind of guy to care about working out, but evidently he did enough for his shirt to stretch tightly over his biceps and chest. <em>Probably the kind of guy to buy shirts a size smaller.</em> Steve thought bitterly as he drank more. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this grouch is gonna dance with me,\u201d Robin commented, turning to Eddie. \u201cDo me the honors?\u201d Eddie smiled deeply, eyes beaming with that mischievous undertone Steve noticed was nearly ever-present.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, <em>I\u2019d</em> be honored.\u201d Eddie took her hand and led her to the dance floor, Steve watching over the brim of his cup as the two danced to the synthy beat that pounded through the speakers. He wasn\u2019t really surprised Eddie could dance, considering he was a musician, but he was surprised he was good at dancing to things that weren\u2019t heavy metal, or whatever it was he listened to. His long hair bounced around his face, which switched between goofy contortions to make Robin laugh, and a genuine smile when he would accomplish his goal of doing so. He even knew the words of the song, singing along gleefully with Robin as they bounced around on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>One song died down, being replaced by one Steve actually recognized, though he wouldn\u2019t readily admit just how well. <em>Lay All Your Love On Me</em> by ABBA began pouring through the speaker, Steve absent-mindedly tapping his foot to the beat as he sipped and continued to watch the two dance. Eddie\u2019s eyes drifted over to him then, Steve feeling the urge to look like he wasn\u2019t watching them for some reason, promptly glancing around the room to attempt to convey that. But Eddie clearly had the goal of pestering Steve in mind, as he shot him a coyish look. </p>\n<p>He danced the few steps needed to close the gap between him and where Steve sat, not giving Steve time to react as Eddie grabbed his free hand with his and tugged him off the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cMunson, what are you doing? Let go of me,\u201d Steve protested as he allowed himself to be yanked forward, as not to spill his drink. Robin smiled as he (forcibly) joined them on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cGiving Mr. Serious an excuse to dance,\u201d Eddie beamed, still swaying in time to the music. He started singing the lyrics pointedly at Steve, Robin joining his attempt to get Steve to dance. Steve rolled his eyes with a sigh, but began swaying in a noncommittal way that could, technically, be considered dancing. This seemed to satisfy the two in front of him as they finally turned their attention from him, Eddie doing so with an encouraging wink that made Steve pause. He blinked a few times, not sure if he imagined the flip in his stomach, or simply misinterpreted the cause of it. Steve peered into his drink, nearly empty. He must have poured more than he thought.</p>\n<p>As the song ended, Vickie, who Robin had a hopeless crush on when they were still in high school, came up and tapped her on the shoulder. Steve watched as excitement and fear flooded his best friend\u2019s face, hiding his amusement in his drink, which he finished.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin! I didn\u2019t think you were gonna be here.\u201d Vickie smiled, Robin sort of just staring at her for a moment. Steve not-so-covertly gave her a shove on the shoulder, kickstarting her to blutter out a few sounds before eventually finding a sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, parties weren\u2019t really my thing in high school. Thought I\u2019d try some out before I\u2026 die.\u201d She cleared her throat, Steve and Eddie sharing a confused look at her odd choice of words. Vickie didn\u2019t seem to find it too weird, however, laughing a bit. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, me too actually. Well, I mean, we were both in band.\u201d Vickie breathed a laugh. \u201cYou get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you look at that, Munson,\u201d Steve turned to Eddie, who raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cI\u2019m all out of alcohol. We should go fix that.\u201d He clapped a hand on Eddie\u2019s shoulder, ignoring Robin\u2019s scared, pleading look. <em>Sometimes you gotta throw a kid in the pool to teach \u2018em how to swim.</em> Steve thought smugly, reveling just a little bit in his friend\u2019s panic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, Harrington. Vickie, good seeing you,\u201d Eddie gave a little half-bow to Vickie, the two boys immediately walking away and ignoring their friend\u2019s sounds of protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprised you know how to be a wingman,\u201d he commented as they made their way back into the kitchen. Eddie also began making himself another drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Steve gave a snort. \u201cI didn\u2019t even date that much in high school. I don\u2019t know why I have the reputation I do.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You don\u2019t know why\u2013</em>\u201d Eddie shook his head, dismissing his obvious contradiction to Steve\u2019s words. \u201cNevermind that. Don\u2019t act like it was by choice. I\u2019m like, ninety-nine percent certain if you hadn\u2019t been fighting monsters and Russians for most of your high school career, you would not be the little church boy you\u2019re claiming yourself as.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what about you, huh?\u201d Steve said after sipping his new mixture, which he had made a tad too strong. \u201cBet you had the freaky chicks hangin\u2019 off you.\u201d A look Steve couldn\u2019t quite place flashed over Eddie\u2019s eyes. Almost a mixture of amusement and confusion and\u2026 analyzing? As if he were trying to figure something out about Steve just by looking at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy experience in the ways of the heart are limited, Harrington. I\u2019m surprised that wasn\u2019t\u2026 glaringly obvious.\u201d He had the intense stare in his eyes he always had, like he\u2019s giving you a hundred percent of his attention even while you talk about something mundane. If there was one thing about Munson, Steve thought, it was that he always made you feel interesting. \u201cI was head of the D&amp;D club, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve shrugged. \u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d He leaned back against the counter behind him, crossing one arm and gesturing vaguely with his drink as his eyes fell absently on the other people talking in the kitchen. \u201cYou have a van, you smoke weed, you\u2019re attractive, and a guitar player in a band\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRewind, did you, Steve Harrington, just call me attractive?\u201d Eddie\u2019s smirk was more infuriating than ever, Steve\u2019s face falling as he felt his face erupt into flames. He rolled his eyes, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t make it a thing. You annoy the shit out of me but I\u2019m not oblivious to what people find attractive. And obviously you know you\u2019re good looking\u2026 so shut up.\u201d He muttered that last part into his cup before taking a long sip.</p>\n<p>The smirk on Eddie\u2019s face had stretched into a smug grin. \u201cWell, I actually didn\u2019t know. But thank you for voicing <em>your</em> opinion of me,\u201d he teased, earning a death glare from Steve. Eddie seemed to look around the kitchen, eyes falling on an open backdoor that led to a backyard, where more people could be seen hanging around. \u201cI\u2019m gonna smoke a cig, wanna join?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don't have any on me.\u201d Steve supplied, Eddie rolling his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, let me rephrase. I\u2019m asking if you\u2019d rather stand awkwardly alone here, or awkwardly next to me while <em>I</em> smoke, and give you one <em>if you\u2019re nice.</em>\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not standing awkwardly,\u201d Steve grumbled defensively. Eddie raised his eyebrows expectantly. \u201cFine. After you, Munson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie led the way outside, and immediately Steve welcomed the cool breeze that pricked up the hairs on his arms and chilled the mugginess from inside right off. There were less people out here, most of whom were smoking, and by the smell it was a mixture of cigarette smokers and weed smokers. The music could still be heard from inside, but muffled, allowing for conversation to flow easier. Eddie leaned against the house, holding out his cup to Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201cBe a dear and hold that for a sec.\u201d As Steve obliged Eddie took out a carton of Marlboro reds, plucking one from the middle and perching it between his lips. He raised an eyebrow at Steve. \u201cWant one?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve looked at the cigarettes in Eddie\u2019s hand, contemplating. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d Eddie held the cigarette up, filter end first, toward Steve. His hands still full holding their drinks, he took it between his lips, quirking his eyebrows up in a gesture of thanks. Eddie lit Steve\u2019s cigarette first before getting his own, then tucked the lighter and carton away in his pocket. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re here, honestly.\u201d Steve said idly through the corner of his mouth, passing off Eddie\u2019s drink and pulling the cig away from his lips. He blew out a puff of smoke. \u201cDidn\u2019t peg you as someone who had a good time singing pop songs in a room full of drunken strangers.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? Because I was a nerd in high school?\u201d Eddie quipped, letting out a puff of his own. Steve seemed to debate this. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah, actually,\u201d he said honestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNerds party too, as our dearest Robin has proven.\u201d He took a long pull from the cigarette, a plume billowing out into the air in front of them. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no. I thought you partied. I just thought they were\u2026 different parties. Ya know, trailer parks and grunge music instead of graduated cheerleaders and ABBA,\u201d Steve clarified. </p>\n<p>\u201cThose are, admittedly, most of the parties I\u2019ve been to. But not because I didn\u2019t think these would be fun. <em>Your kind</em> just never invited me to these.\u201d Eddie raised his eyebrows pointedly at Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My kind,</em>\u201d Steve repeated with a light hearted roll of his eyes. \u201cGuess it doesn\u2019t matter so much now that we\u2019re graduated? Considering you got an invite to this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently so,\u201d Eddie punctuated this with another puff of smoke. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Steve furrowed his brows.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d said with an exhale of smoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis scene is the kind of place I expected you to be thriving. Natural habitat,\u201d Eddie smirked. \u201cSo, why so gloomy?\u201d Steve inspected Eddie, trying to discern if he was actually asking or just trying to annoy Steve. But Eddie\u2019s eyes were earnest as he waited for a reply, smoking through more of his cigarette. Steve sighed, looking out upon the backyard and watching the groups of people laughing and conversing amongst themselves. He smoked more before answering.</p>\n<p>\u201cPartying has sort of\u2026 lost its charm, I guess. All things considered,\u201d Steve took a long sip of his drink, hyper aware of Eddie\u2019s endless eyes bored into the side of his face. For some reason it made him squirm. He\u2019d never found Eddie intimidating before, and even now that wasn\u2019t the right word, but over their time killing Vecna Steve learned he\u2019s the kind of guy who <em>really sees</em> what\u2019s going on. He pays attention. And Steve wasn\u2019t used to someone paying so close attention to him. Not in any <em>real</em> way. </p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I can understand that.\u201d Eddie said, surprisingly serious for once. \u201cSuppose for me, being a recluse lost its charm.\u201d There was a small pause, Eddie no longer looking at Steve but somewhere in the distance ahead, before he added \u201cThere were\u2026 a lot of times I thought I was going to die. Times I thought most of us were going to die. Guess I realized life\u2019s not really worth it without people, and I didn\u2019t want mine to end before I got some people in it that I cared about. <em>Really</em> cared about. Not just high school bandmates, or whatever. As great as they are, besides our shared interest we don\u2019t have much tying us together, ya know?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve did know. He knew plenty of people, sure. Teammates, other \u201cpopular\u201d students from school that he associated with because\u2026 well, because he felt like it was the thing to do. But it wasn\u2019t until Nancy, Robin, and the kids that he <em>really</em> cared about people and whether or not they stayed in his life. That he wanted to do things <em>for people,</em> and not because of what he got out of it. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d They smoked in silence for a moment, Steve watching Eddie from the corner of his eye, and he had to admit to himself that over the group\u2019s time killing Vecna, he\u2019d come to consider Eddie someone he, at the very least, detested the idea of him dying. In fact, one of the scariest moments throughout the entire ordeal was when he thought they\u2019d lost Eddie. Vecna had him in his grasp, tentacles strangling him as Eddie hovered high above the ground. Steve had sworn Eddie had been right next to him, and then the next second he was hoisted in the air, clawing feebially at the vines as his face contorted, choked noises scraping to escape his mouth.</p>\n<p>Steve hadn\u2019t known he was running until he was at Vecna, chopping the tentacles off in one swift motion, Eddie\u2019s body dropping to the ground. Vecna had tried to get Steve in that moment of course, but Robin, Nancy, and Lucas had successfully fought him off enough for Steve to pull Eddie behind some cover.</p>\n<p><em>\u201dMunson? Eddie, look at me,\u201d Steve lightly patted Eddie\u2019s cheek, tugging the long haired boy\u2019s attention to him as he crouched over his slouched form. Fear was the only thing in his wide, brown eyes, and it was jarring to see a guy who carried himself with such confidence look so </em>small. <em>\u201dYou\u2019re okay, hey\u2013\u201d Steve put his hands on Eddie\u2019s shoulders, forcing him to hold his gaze as panicked, scratchy breaths poured out of the boy below him. \u201cYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019re here.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Eddie hadn\u2019t said anything right away. Just tugged Steve down into a crushing hug, hands fisting in Steve\u2019s clothes. And Steve had hugged him back just as tightly. He had thanked him properly later, when it was all said and done and it was just the two of them awake in the Wheeler\u2019s basement.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez, you really do think I\u2019m attractive,\u201d Eddie\u2019s words dragged Steve back to the moment, and he realized he had been staring at Eddie for a considerable time now, a smirk on his face and cigarette discarded in a nearby ashtray on the porch railing. Heat flooded Steve\u2019s face for the second time that night as he snapped his eyes away, a scowl crossing his face in an attempt to hide his embarrassment. </p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. I was just lost in thought,\u201d he muttered as he took a long drink. He\u2019d drunk enough now for his head to feel fuzzy and body warm, but not enough to numb his self consciousness entirely. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, lost in thoughts about how hot I am,\u201d Eddie teased, a satisfied grin crossing his face as Steve shot him a look. </p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re insufferable,\u201d Steve sighed out smoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. You secretly love it,\u201d Eddie bumped his shoulder against Steve, then looked into Steve\u2019s nearly empty cup, then his own. \u201cHere, finish mine. I should start sobering up to drive.\u201d Steve threw back the rest of his drink before stacking Eddie\u2019s cup in his, and taking a sip.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to get me drunk, Munson?\u201d Steve arched a brow at the accused, who was watching him with an odd smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cThink you\u2019re doing a good enough job of that yourself, Harrington,\u201d Eddie retorted smoothly, and the silence that followed lingered just a bit thicker than usual as they regarded each other, Steve finding himself momentarily distracted by the look in the other\u2019s eyes. A feeling Steve couldn\u2019t pinpoint flooded him, as if he were suddenly a million times drunker, and then confusion. For a second, he even considered his drink being spiked, but he\u2019d pourn his own drinks and knew Eddie wouldn\u2019t do that. Plus, he watched Eddie mix the drink he was now drinking. He cleared his throat and shook his head again, breaking the abnormally long eye contact they had been holding and putting the rest of the cigarette out in the ashtray.</p>\n<p>The two of them joined Robin and Vickie again, Steve getting considerably drunker throughout the rest of the party than he had intended, but by the end of it he was thoroughly enjoying himself. So much so he didn\u2019t think twice about how close he was sitting to Eddie on the couch, or the fact that Eddie\u2019s arm was slung over the back of it and all he\u2019d have to do is tip his head back to be\u2013 for all intents and purposes\u2013 in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>seriously</em> telling me that you think Mike Myers would beat Freddy Krueger in a fight?\u201d Eddie looked at Steve in disbelief, Steve laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat guy is <em>tenacious,</em> man. Give me one reason why he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Steve challenged, looking hazily at Eddie through lidded eyes. He smiled wider at the way Eddie was watching him intently, big brown eyes only focused on him as an amused smile hung on his lips. Steve didn\u2019t realize until this moment how close they really were, knees brushing and heads tilted toward one another so they could be heard over the music. He blamed the buzzing inside him on the copious amount of booze that he\u2019d consumed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can give you, like, a million,\u201d Eddie chuckled, as if the argument was too easy. \u201cFor one, Mike Myers is just some dude. Freddy lives in <em>your fuckin\u2019 nightmares.</em> All he\u2019d have to do is wait for Myers to sleep and he\u2019d have no chance! Plus, you can\u2019t hurt Freddy unless you drag him into the real world, which is incredibly hard to do.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2013 but consider this\u2026\u201d Steve held up a pointer finger, leaning a fraction of an inch closer and twisting his torso to face Eddie more. \u201cMike has a scarier mask.\u201d Eddie furrowed his brows at Steve before bursting out into laughter. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026 putting <em>aside</em> the fact Freddy doesn\u2019t need a mask to be scary\u2026 how does that mean Mike can kill him?\u201d Steve looked away, considering Eddie\u2019s words before laughing almost groggily to himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t. You win, Munson,\u201d Steve patted Eddie\u2019s knee, leaving his hand to rest there without really taking much notice that he did so. \u201cLet\u2019s revisit this argument when I\u2019m sober. Then I\u2019ll get ya.\u201d Eddie didn\u2019t respond right away, looking at Steve as if he said something wildly confusing, which puzzled Steve because he didn\u2019t think he had. Though it was getting harder to remember what they were talking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of which, I think it\u2019s time I get you kids home,\u201d Eddie leaned around Steve to interject into Robin and Vickie\u2019s conversation. \u201cHey, Vickie, you need a ride? I was gonna take Robin and Steve home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah actually. I came here with someone, but I saw him go upstairs with some girl a while ago and haven\u2019t seen him since,\u201d she gave him a genuine smile. \u201cThanks, Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still wanna spend the night at mine?\u201d Robin asked, and even in Steve\u2019s deeply inebriated state he saw the blush rush to Vickie\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, y-yeah. If that\u2019s still\u2013 I mean if you\u2019re still cool with it?\u201d Steve and Eddie shared a knowing look at this.</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yeah! I\u2019m cool with it!\u201d Robin said eagerly, her face lighting up before she seemingly realized how she sounded and cleared her throat.</p>\n<p>Steve leaned in close to Eddie, whispering \u201cIt\u2019s like watching two science experiments learning to hold a conversation.\u201d Eddie chuckled at this, playfully hitting Steve on the arm before standing up. He caught Steve off guard by pulling him up quickly by the wrists, letting go too fast for Steve to get his bearings and causing him to stumble forward into Eddie\u2019s chest, his forearms the only thing in between them.</p>\n<p>Eddie chuckled. \u201cEasy there, Harrington. I know we\u2019ve established you think I\u2019m irresistible, but we\u2019re in public.\u201d His voice was low and resonated between them, their noses barely an inch apart, and it pulled a <em>giggle</em> from Steve, of all things.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wish, Munson,\u201d he pushed himself off of Eddie with a roll of his eyes. He noticed Robin giving him an odd look, but whatever she was thinking she decided not to voice it as the four made their way through the house and to Eddie\u2019s van on the street.</p>\n<p>They dropped the girls off first, saying their goodbyes as they filed out of the back of the van, and leaned on each other as they walked up Robin\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d Eddie cooed, clasping his hands over his chest like a dramatic mother. Steve smiled as he watched to make sure his friends got in. Once they disappeared inside, Eddie began to pull out of the driveway and Steve began giving him directions to his house. </p>\n<p>The drive wasn\u2019t long, the cool night air filling the van from the open windows, a peaceful silence blanketing the boys besides one of Eddie\u2019s cassettes playing on low volume.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour humble abode, Harrington,\u201d Eddie gestured to the not-so-humble two-story house that Steve called home. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the ride, man. And for <em>somehow</em> making the party more tolerable,\u201d Steve gave Eddie a teasing look. Eddie pulled a face of mock offense, but his face quickly crumbled into that familiar fun-loving smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry not to miss me too much,\u201d he grinned, earning an eye roll from Steve, but this time a smile was unable to leave his own face. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I regret this night already,\u201d Steve opened his door and hopped out, stopping briefly to put a hand on the driver side door, peering in the window slightly. \u201cNight, Munson.\u201d He gave the van two pats before making his way up his driveway, swaying slightly as he was still reasonably drunk. When he got his door opened he turned over his shoulder to see Eddie still in the driveway, presumably waiting until he got in as well. He gave a small wave before disappearing into his house, and making his way as quietly as he could to his room.</p>\n<p>When he flopped back onto his bed he found himself replaying a lot of the night in his head, which consisted entirely of Eddie as they had been nearly glued to each other\u2019s side the whole night. He drifted off to sleep with a faint smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why I\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Steve stated, doing a final hair-check in his rearview mirror.</p>\n<p>Robin groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I have to talk you into another thing. I used all my big ammo last time.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m driving us there aren\u2019t I?\u201d Steve pointed out, starting his car. \u201cI just don\u2019t see why my presence is necessary. In fact,\u201d he glanced over at Robin as they began the drive. \u201cWhy are you going over to Munson\u2019s at all? You and Vickie should just go on a date.\u201d </p>\n<p>Robin scoffed. \u201cSure. Let me just, <em>ask her on a date,</em>\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cLike that\u2019s not presumptuous. Just because I know she likes girls now doesn\u2019t mean she likes <em>me.</em>\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShe slept over the night of the party,\u201d Steve reminded, but Robin gave a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s different when you\u2019re gay. Girls have sleepovers all the time. Makes it hard to know when you\u2019re sleeping over, or <em>sleeping over.</em>\u201d Admittedly, he realized now she was right and it didn\u2019t really narrow anything down. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so what did you two do when you got inside?\u201d He realized if he didn\u2019t outright tell his friend what was romantic and what wasn\u2019t, Vickie would have a wife and kids by the time Robin made a move. </p>\n<p>\u201cWent upstairs and got ready for bed. I let her borrow some sleep clothes, but again, that\u2019s\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Normal for friends. Guys have sleepovers, too, Rob,\u201d Steve glanced over at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to remind me what\u2019s normal sleepover behavior. Did you share a bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2026 yeah. I wasn\u2019t gonna make her sleep on the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEhhh\u2026\u201d Steve debated, pursing his lips together. \u201cI dunno. Could go either way, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, were you gonna try and tell me you\u2019ve never shared a bed with a guy friend?\u201d Robin countered.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue, but that\u2019s usually reserved for close guy friends and only if I\u2019m too tired to get them shit to sleep with.\u201d Steve held up his index finger, as if telling her to slow down. \u201cYou went from talking a few times at school\u2013 if you could call it that\u2013 to talking all night at a party, to sharing a bed the first time she comes to your house. Not to mention she totally could\u2019ve gone home, Munson was down to drive her.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but that\u2019s practically what you did with Eddie.\u201d Robin pointed out, and for some reason Steve found his face heating. \u201cBarely knew each other, then talked all night at a party. You just didn\u2019t sleep over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously different,\u201d Steve rolled his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cEddie\u2019s not gay,\u201d he said with a breathy laugh, as if it were obvious. There was a pause, causing Steve to glance over at Robin, who to his surprise seemed to be studying him closely, eyes narrowed like they do when she thinks deeply.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI find it interesting you didn\u2019t say because <em>you\u2019re</em> not gay. And two: did he tell you that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve opened his mouth to answer, but shut it before doing so. \u201cNo\u2026? I guess not. I just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAssumed?\u201d Robin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah. I don\u2019t really spend my time wondering who\u2019s gay or not gay, Rob,\u201d He glanced over at Robin again. \u201cIs he gay?-- No, nevermind. Pretend I didn\u2019t ask. I probably shouldn\u2019t be asking you that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou could always ask him.\u201d Robin supplied, gave a lopsided smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels like something I shouldn\u2019t just be asking people,\u201d Steve responded, gesturing with one hand to himself. \u201cMight come off like a hate crime.\u201d Robin let out a laugh at this, earning a chuckle from Steve himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever. You and Eddie are just here so I don\u2019t freak out and ramble about something totally freakish,\u201d Robin finally answered his question, though Steve still didn\u2019t see much of the point. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a miracle worker, Robbie,\u201d he teased, Robin playfully swatting his shoulder. They picked up Vickie on the way to the trailer park, Steve greeting her and doing the best to keep conversation flowing on the ride over when he saw Robin struggling with what to say next. He supposed he saw what she meant, now, plus a horror movie is a perfect excuse to get a little friendlier-than-friends with someone. Either way, if this is what his friend needed to get a grip on her confidence, he was more than willing to help.</p>\n<p>They pulled up outside Eddie\u2019s trailer not long after, the three filing out of the car and Robin knocking on the door first. Considering it was a trailer, it didn\u2019t take long for Eddie to open the door. He smiled warmly at Robin, pulling her into a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome back, Rob,\u201d Eddie said as he pulled away, turning to address Vickie and Steve. \u201cVickie, Harrington, try not to lose your minds over the estate, hard as it may be.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for having us, Eddie,\u201d Vickie smiled encouragingly, Eddie opening the door wider and gesturing for them to come in. Steve filed in last and kicked his shoes off next to the others\u2019, Eddie closing the door behind him and moving to the kitchenette.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys can have a seat. Can I get you anything? Water? Beer?\u201d He looked between the three of them. \u201cSoda? Weed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not corrupt them just yet, maybe.\u201d Robin smiled, as if sharing a private joke with Eddie. He chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably for the best. Robin doesn\u2019t shut up when she\u2019s high,\u201d Eddie stage whispered the last part to Steve and Vickie. Steve bit back a comment about how that wasn\u2019t much different to Robin sober. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d She interjected. \u201cYou said you thought I was interesting!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I did!\u201d Eddie shouted in defense. He grabbed a beer from the fridge, holding the door open and gesturing questioningly to Vickie and Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeer, please. If we\u2019re watching <em> Poltergeist</em> I\u2019m gonna need to calm my nerves,\u201d Vickie chuckled, Robin smiling downright fondly at her. Eddie pointed at Steve, looking at him expectantly. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure. With one beer I\u2019ll still be good to drive after the movie,\u201d Steve shrugged, taking a seat on the couch next to Robin and Vickie. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah. By the way, my uncle\u2019s gonna be gone all weekend so if you guys wanna stay the night feel free.\u201d Eddie nodded at the couch. \u201cThat pulls out and can fit two people. And Harrington, you could crash in my room.\u201d He got beer for all of them and popped in the VHS, also taking it upon himself to turn out all the lights and draw the curtains before he took a seat on the other side of Steve. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s a tight squeeze on the couch y\u2019all.\u201d Everyone made various noises expressing they didn\u2019t mind, settling in for the movie. </p>\n<p>Eddie got up about twenty minutes in and brought over two blankets, passing one over to Vickie and Robin before he began covering himself with the blanket. He held up a corner, raising his brows at Steve. \u201cBlanket or no?\u201d Eddie asked softly. Steve looked over, debating for only a second before agreeing and pulling it over the both of them and muttering a thanks. </p>\n<p>It was weird seeing Eddie in such a casual light. No denim vest or leather jacket, just a faded band tee and tucked under a blanket. Still wore his ridiculous amount of rings, which admittedly made his fingers look nice. Steve noticed now, the light of the tv glinting off them as he took a sip of his beer, that he had really long fingers. Very suited for playing guitar, he thought. It was then that Steve realized he had been staring at Munson\u2019s fingers for way too long, and his gaze jerked back to the screen. </p>\n<p>The couch was a tight squeeze, Eddie was right, but Steve found he didn\u2019t mind as the movie pressed on, the eerie atmosphere building. Eventually Eddie moved his arm to rest on the back of the couch, giving Steve slightly more arm room but somehow, at the same time, making the space feel more intimate. Steve took a sip of his beer and tried to focus more on the movie. He\u2019d never seen it before, and while it wasn\u2019t the scariest movie he\u2019d seen\u2013 and certainly not the scariest thing he\u2019d <em>actually</em> seen\u2013 a jumpscare with a clown doll managed to get him. </p>\n<p>Steve jolted with a loud yell, hands shooting out to grip Eddie\u2019s shoulder and chest, his shirt balling slightly in his fists. \u201cJesus fucking christ,\u201d Steve breathed out, head slumping and grip loosening on Eddie, but not fully releasing just yet. </p>\n<p>\u201cJeez, Harrington,\u201d He turned to see Eddie smirking at him, and their proximity almost gave Steve deja vu. Eddie clapped the hand resting on the couch on the base of Steve\u2019s neck, causing all of the hairs to suddenly stand on end as his thumb brushed over the bare skin quickly. \u201cWho knew you were so scared of clowns? Or was it the fact it was a doll?\u201d Eddie teased, removing his hand and placing it back on the couch. Steve shot him an unimpressed look, not dignifying him with a response as his body relaxed again and his attention was back on the tv. Or, at least, he tried to turn it back to the tv. He found himself thinking about Eddie\u2019s thumb brushing over the back of his neck for the next few minutes. </p>\n<p>When he realized how fixated he had become, he shifted uncomfortably and finished his beer. \u201cIs it cool if I get another one?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBe my guest,\u201d Eddie nodded with a shrug, gesturing to the kitchenette beside them. When Steve sat back down it was a bit closer to Eddie than he intended, but he simply opened the beer and followed Eddie\u2019s lead in putting his feet up on the table in front of them, leaning back a bit. As he did this, his throat tightened at the realization he was practically leaning his head against Eddie\u2019s shoulder. What if Eddie got weirded out? What if Robin and Vickie thought it was weird? Should he move over, or is that drawing more attention to it then just staying where he is? Steve\u2019s whole body felt tense, like all of his muscles were flexed in an attempt to not invade Eddie\u2019s space too much. Like relaxing would be the last straw that made Eddie flip out on him for being so weird when he invited Steve to his home. </p>\n<p>Steve had never been this worried about what a person thought of his actions, and these thoughts whirled around his head but he still wasn\u2019t sure if moving would be the right decision. He was frozen with indecision, not even paying attention to the movie anymore when something fell over his shoulder. Steve glanced to see Eddie had shifted a bit, his hand having fallen lightly over Steve\u2019s shoulder. Sparing another glance at Eddie\u2019s face, Steve saw he was simply taking a sip of his beer, unphased by any possible weirdness Steve had been stressing over.</p>\n<p>All at once Steve felt himself unclench, a soft breath he hadn\u2019t realized he was holding left his mouth all at once as he deflated into the couch. If Eddie was so unbothered by his hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder, then he was fine with the proximity, and probably didn\u2019t even notice what he\u2019d been stressing about. At least, that was Steve\u2019s logic, and it allowed him to relax against Eddie without worry. </p>\n<p>During a tense scene where the wife falls into a sunken crypt, a bunch of muddy skeletons popping up around her as she struggles to get out, he even found himself leaning closer to Eddie. Subconsciously at first, but he became aware when he realized his shoulder was leaning against Eddie\u2019s chest, Steve tucked into his side and Eddie\u2019s hand still loosely hanging over his other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYa know,\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice was soft and quiet in Steve\u2019s ear. \u201cThey used real skeletons in this scene.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s face scrunched in skepticism. He tilted his head a bit, still keeping his eyes on the screen as he whispered back. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not that gullible, Munson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie chuckled in his ear, deep and rumbling in his chest against Steve. Steve\u2019s hair stood on end again. He blamed the movie.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, It\u2019s true. My uncle has a friend who worked on the set,\u201d Eddie said. </p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, \u2018cause it\u2019s impossible for you to lie about that, too,\u201d he said sarcastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me or not, Harrington,\u201d and Eddie saying his last name in his ear shouldn\u2019t be making his stomach feel <em>like that.</em> \u201cI\u2019m just trying to share a fun fact to keep you from jumping out of your skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour logic was to tell me those are <em>real dead people</em> in order to calm me down?\u201d Steve breathed a laugh. He wanted to look over at Eddie, the urge almost winning out, but for some reason he was also fearful. The fear won out. \u201cI thought you were supposed to be smart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow who told you that? I graduated high school at 20, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve shrugged. \u201cNo one had to,\u201d he answered honestly. \u201cYour ideas saved our asses more than once. Hasn\u2019t anyone ever told you high school isn\u2019t everything, Munson?\u201d His curiosity won out in the end, head turning to face the boy beside him. Eddie was already looking at him, large eyes picking him apart like he was a puzzle. It caught Steve off guard, the air of cockiness yanked away as soon as they made eye contact, and for the second time now Steve found his face inches away from Eddie\u2019s. Steve\u2019s eyes darted between Eddie\u2019s before\u2013 and he doesn\u2019t know why he did this\u2013 falling on Eddie\u2019s lips for a fraction of a second. Blink and you\u2019ll miss it, or at least Steve hoped so.</p>\n<p>Heat sprung to his face and he snapped his head back to the screen. Robin stood up then, also asking Eddie if she could grab another beer.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, that we always manage to have an endless supply of. Go nuts,\u201d Eddie gestured with the hand that wasn\u2019t on Steve. As Robin stood up she seemed to almost do a double take at Steve, no doubt confused that they were tolerating each other so easily. </p>\n<p>\u201cGrab me one too?\u201d Steve asked as she walked over. Robin waved her hand to indicate she got it, passing the can to him as she took her seat next to him again. She gave him that odd look again, one she\u2019d been giving more and more, but Steve never really knew what she was thinking and she never elaborated. He brushed it off, cracking his third beer while relaxing further into Eddie. </p>\n<p>The first movie ended and everyone agreed they wanted to watch another, Eddie giving the girls free reign of his horror movie collection. Robin and Vickie sat on the floor in front of the television, Eddie and Steve still on the couch sipping their beers, of which Vickie got Eddie a fresh one. </p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d be the kind of guy to get spooked by horror movies, Harrington,\u201d Eddie teased. Steve gave him a look and knocked his knee against Eddie\u2019s under the blanket, having to draw it back first as his side was now completely pressed against Eddie\u2019s. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe only reason you didn\u2019t jump is because you\u2019ve seen it before,\u201d Steve defended. \u201cI\u2019m not even the only one here who jumped, either!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re the one who gets most riled up over it,\u201d Eddie was the one to knock his knee against Steve\u2019s, this time. Steve buried his face in his beer, grumbling out a \u201cwhatever.\u201d </p>\n<p>The girls ended up choosing <em>The Exorcist</em>, a movie that had so far shown to be mostly without jumpscares. Robin and Eddie had already seen the film, and they both seemed to enjoy teasing Vickie and Steve over their lack of culture. </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until halfway through the movie that Steve realized Eddie\u2019s arm had long been off the back of the couch, now directly slung around Steve\u2019s shoulders. And the only reason this came to his attention was the maddeningly distracting patterns Eddie was softly tracing with his thumb over Steve\u2019s shirt. A little girl was spider-walking and spewing blood on screen, and all Steve could focus on was how Eddie seemed to enjoy tracing Steve\u2019s collar bone through his shirt, electricity shooting up his spine when the thumb would brush over skin and ever-so-slightly dip under his collar before popping back out. </p>\n<p>Steve would find himself glancing over at Eddie, wondering if the latter knew the effect of what he was doing, but every time he seemed to intently be watching the screen. Eventually Steve gave up trying to discern if this was some weird way to fuck with him, and just enjoyed the feeling. If it was an attempt to annoy Steve, he felt triumphant in the fact that it was having the opposite effect. He didn\u2019t know what to think if it wasn\u2019t with the intention to annoy him, so he didn\u2019t entertain that possibility, dismissing the question as soon as he asked himself it. </p>\n<p>The end of the movie came much quicker than Steve expected, especially since they said it was a long movie. To Steve\u2019s surprising dismay, Eddie unwrapped his arm from him and stretched, Robin stifling a yawn as well. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get the couch pulled out for y\u2019all,\u201d the four stood up at Eddie\u2019s words, the girls pulling back the coffee table while Steve and Eddie pulled out the couch. \u201cYou two can keep these blankets, and there\u2019s some pillows underneath the couch for you. If you need anything my room is the furthest down the hall.\u201d Steve grabbed all the empty beer cans in his arms and tossed them in the waste bin before they all said their goodnights. </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s room was pretty much exactly what Steve expected. There were D&amp;D books, a guitar and an amp, a reasonably filled ashtray, a bong, some clothes strewn about, and the walls were littered with various posters of movies and bands. Tucked into the corner was a full bed with dark red spreading. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can sleep on the floor if you got a pillow,\u201d Steve supplied groggily, wiping the sleep out of his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not making you sleep on the floor, man. What kind of host do you think I am?\u201d Eddie rummaged through his dresser before turning around and throwing clothes at Steve\u2019s. He did not catch them in time, them hitting him smack in the face. He grabbed them off of his face and looked at a pair of sweatpants and a stretched out t-shirt. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to sleep in jeans and a crewneck.\u201d Eddie closed his door and began unbuckling his belt, Steve immediately whipping around so he wouldn\u2019t see. </p>\n<p>He took a second before he took off his shirt and slid on Eddie\u2019s. It smelled overwhelmingly like him, his whole room did, which wasn\u2019t a bad thing, just\u2026 noteworthy to Steve. Once Steve had changed into Eddie\u2019s clothes he turned around, his brain buffering as it slowly registered that Eddie was shirtless, wearing nothing but sweatpants. His long hair fell over his bare shoulders, his upper body just as toned as his arms would imply.</p>\n<p>Steve felt himself staring as Eddie moved for the door, and he quickly blinked himself back into reality, tearing his gaze away. \u201cI don\u2019t have an extra toothbrush, but you can rub toothpaste on your teeth if you want.\u201d Steve took this as a cue to follow him to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than nothin\u2019.\u201d Steve commented as he entered, Eddie leaving him to get ready for bed. Once Steve was done Eddie dipped out to presumably do the same, chuckling when he returned to see Steve just standing awkwardly in the middle of his room. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can get in the bed, Harrington,\u201d he flopped onto his bed, scooting over to make room and relaxing back, his arms stretching behind him to prop up his head. It was impossible for Steve not to take in the way they flexed, and his toned chest rising and falling with a single necklace atop it. With his messy waves of hair, Steve couldn\u2019t believe he was saying it, but Eddie looked downright <em>pretty.</em> \u201cYou walk around my place like you\u2019re scared of breaking it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve made a noncommittal scoff of dismissal, instead climbing tentatively under the covers, Eddie following suit. \u201cCan you get the light?\u201d Eddie pointed to the bedside lamp next to Steve's side of the bed. Steve began fiddling with the little knob on the side, but the light never turned off. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can never get these on the first go,\u201d he grunted to himself, slightly embarrassed that he was struggling to turn a damned lamp off. </p>\n<p>\u201cNah, here. It\u2019s kinda broken,\u201d and without warning Eddie was leaning over him, bare chest and dangling necklace inches from Steve\u2019s face as the man above him tried his hand at turning the light off. He paused for a moment, looking down at Steve with something the latter couldn\u2019t understand. Eddie breathed a short laugh, a small smile, shaking his head as he returned his attention back to the light. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cLike what?\u201d He asked genuinely.</p>\n<p>Eddie glanced back with an almost reprimanding look in his eyes, then they were plunged into darkness, but the pale moonlight filtering through Eddie\u2019s window illuminated him just enough for Steve to see him still smirking down at him. \u201cSee? Just needed a little finesse,\u201d he wiggled his fingers in front of Steve\u2019s face before rolling off of him and back onto his side of the bed. Steve let out yet another held breath he hadn't been aware of. \u201cNighty-night, Harrington,\u201d Eddie sighed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight, Munson,\u201d and if it hadn\u2019t been for the light amount of alcohol in his system, Steve might\u2019ve found himself awake all night trying to decipher what Eddie was talking about. But not long after Eddie\u2019s breaths slowed, Steve found himself slipping into one of the most peaceful sleeps of his life. </p>\n<p>He was thinking more about the conversation he had with Robin on the way to Eddie\u2019s. A week or so had passed since, and Robin and Vickie had kissed after the boys went to bed that night. But while Robin had Vickie\u2019s feelings confirmed, Steve found himself unable to confirm his own thoughts and feelings.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, you good?\u201d Robin asked with raised eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve looked up. \u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been pushing around the same sausage on your plate for like, five minutes,\u201d Robin supplied, and he realized she was right. They were getting breakfast before work, something they did when they opened together.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah I just\u2026 Did you ever figure it out?\u201d Steve asked, knowing obviously that wasn\u2019t enough for Robin to know what he was talking about, but feeling too silly for asking what he was really asking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I\u2019m a lesbian? Yeah, we\u2019ve talked about it in detail, Stevie,\u201d Steve rolled his eyes at her sarcasm.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d He sighed, pursing his lips as he debated actually asking. She\u2019d know immediately, and then it would be a whole <em>thing.</em> Instead of what it was. Which was a question. <em>Just a question,</em> Steve thought. \u201cHow to tell if sharing the bed is platonic or not. Ya know, when you\u2019re both the same gender.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin hit him with that scrutinizing gaze, and her delayed answer made it feel like ants were crawling up Steve\u2019s spine. \u201cI mean, obviously in the case of Vickie it wasn\u2019t. But I think you\u2019re asking for like, concrete evidence that it\u2019s one way or the other, and in that case no. I haven\u2019t. I think it varies from situation to situation.\u201d There was a long pause, and Steve knew there was no avoiding what she was going to ask next. \u201cWhy?\u201d She said it almost as if she already had an idea to the answer, her eyes narrowing curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Steve shrugged with a shake of his head, finally eating the sausage on his plate. She gave him an unconvinced look.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this about the movie night at Eddie\u2019s trailer?\u201d She leaned in closer, voice soft and no hint of teasing in it, which almost made it worse. It made Steve feel like it was <em>a thing,</em> something she couldn\u2019t joke about. \u201cDid something happen between you two?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No,\u201d Steve denied, still opting to stare at his plate rather than her. He wasn\u2019t lying, but for some reason he felt like he was. \u201cObviously not. I was just\u2026 wondering.\u201d Robin nodded in that way she did when Steve\u2019s answer gave her more of one than he intended, and he sighed heavily. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Obviously\u2026\u201d She treaded carefully. \u201cBut in the event it\u2019s\u2026 not so obvious\u2026 I\u2019d say if you have to think about it too hard, it might not be just platonic.\u201d </p>\n<p><em>\u201dI find it interesting you didn\u2019t say because </em>you\u2019re<em> not gay.\u201d</em> Steve shook his head in an attempt to shake off his thoughts. </p>\n<p>\u201cOr, you could always just ask,\u201d Robin supplied unhelpfully. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid <em>you</em> \u2018just ask\u2019?\u201d Steve asked accusingly. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Robin said simply. \u201cBut I kissed her and that\u2019s sorta like asking. You could always kiss him. You\u2019ll definitely get your answer that way.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to have a helpful friend like you,\u201d Steve muttered sarcastically into his coffee mug. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, you know if you\u2019re\u2026 struggling with that, I\u2019m here for you, right?\u201d Her serious tone was back, and Steve was starting to hate this whole ordeal. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not struggling with anything, Robbie,\u201d he put his silverware down with a clank, finally finishing his breakfast. \u201cAfter you pointed out I had just assumed he was straight, I started getting worried I was sending him mixed signals. That\u2019s all.\u201d And Steve could almost believe it himself. Because it was at least partially true, wasn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Robin said after a far too long silence, and Steve knew she was less than convinced and just doing him the gracious favor of not pushing it. \u201cStill. What I said stands.\u201d Thankfully, there was no more Eddie talk, or discussion of anyone\u2019s sexuality besides Robin rambling affectionately about Vickie, which Steve was grateful for.</p>\n<p>Work was uneventful for most of the day, until Eddie came in about twenty minutes before closing, and Steve suppressed a groan, instead opting for a roll of his eyes as he restocked the candy they kept at the checkout counter. He was already unhappy about getting stuck working opening to closing, their coworkers having called in sick at the last minute, and the last thing he needed to deal with was the whirlwind that was Eddie Munson. </p>\n<p>\u201cRob, Harrington. I\u2019m in crisis,\u201d Eddie said dramatically as he flopped his upper body onto the counter. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, watch it!\u201d Steve swatted Eddie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna crush the candy bars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your crisis?\u201d Robin asked as she swept the floor. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna have a party for my twenty-first, but my uncle\u2019s gonna be here for a while. He\u2019s cool or whatever, but not cool enough to party around, ya know?\u201d Eddie explained, his attention mostly directed to Robin. \u201cAny ideas where I should have it instead? I was thinking the woods but that just spells shitty-teen-slasher-movie. Especially in this town.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201d Steve asked, neatly stacking Snickers bars.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Friday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about a bowling alley?\u201d Robin offered, Eddie giving her a disappointed look.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my twenty first. I wanna get drunk, not throw a heavy ball around a bunch of middle schoolers and geriatrics,\u201d Eddie retorted, Robin putting her hands up in mock defense.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could always have it at mine,\u201d Steve\u2019s sentence didn\u2019t only catch Robin and Eddie off guard, who were now staring at him like he turned into a demogorgon, but himself. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> wanna host <em>my</em> birthday party?\u201d Eddie clarified, Steve shrugging as there was no use taking it back now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? My parents are gone this weekend visiting family, and I have a pool. It just can\u2019t be a huge thing,\u201d Steve pointed his finger at Eddie like he was a dad setting the house rules to his teenage son. \u201cNo more than ten people besides us, no smoking inside, no glass by the pool, and upstairs is off limits to anyone but you two and Vickie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington, I could kiss you,\u201d Eddie clapped Steve on the shoulder, who pointedly ignored the blush working to his face as he busied himself with the candy once more. \u201cWhat\u2019d\u2019ya say, Robin? Call up Vickie and tell her to bring a friend or two? I\u2019m only gonna invite the guys from the band, anyway.\u201d Steve rolled his eyes again at this. He didn\u2019t think Eddie\u2019s bandmates were very fond of him, but it was Eddie\u2019s birthday party and they were tolerable enough. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s down,\u201d Robin shrugged. </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019m gonna go tell the guys,\u201d Eddie turned over his shoulder as he began to leave the Family Video Store. \u201cThanks Harrington!\u201d He called as the bell jingled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey\u2013 tell your friends it\u2019s BYOB!\u201d Steve yelled after him, Eddie giving a flippant wave as he disappeared into the night. </p>\n<p>There was a silence only accompanied by the sounds of sweeping and crinkling candy wrappers. Finally, Robin was the one to break it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was awfully nice of you\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut it,\u201d Steve shut down, before disappearing into the back to get more Crunch bars. Great. Now he was <em>hosting</em> a party. Objectively way less fun than simply attending one, which Steve barely wanted to do. <em>Stupid Eddie fuckin\u2019 Munson.</em> </p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>He knew the party wasn\u2019t gonna be fun, but it was Eddie\u2019s birthday and it wasn\u2019t like Steve could take back his offer. That\u2019d be pretty fuckin\u2019 rude, he thought, but he certainly wished he did. The only people he knew were Robin, Vickie, and Eddie, and he was pretty sure everyone else there hated his guts. Sure, they\u2019ll swim in his pool, but god forbid they greet him with the slightest smile. Or at the very least, not scowl when they make awkward eye contact across the pool. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you <em>like</em> being miserable at parties, Harrington,\u201d he looked up to see Eddie sitting down next to him, his feet joining his in the pool, two unopened beers in his hand. He offered one to Steve, who took it with an appreciative nod. \u201cOr were you just moping around \u2018cause you hoped I would come over to cheer you up?\u201d And just like that Steve\u2019s moment of gratefulness washed away. </p>\n<p>\u201cI think your friends are trying to explode me with their minds,\u201d Steve said, looking over at Eddie\u2019s bandmates staring daggers at Steve over their cups, not bothering to hide the fact they were talking about him. It made his skin prickle, but he just took a long swig of his beer. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just jealous that a jock is my new BFF. Don\u2019t pay attention to them, Harrington,\u201d Eddie knocked his bare shoulder into Steve\u2019s, giving him a smile that could almost be described as encouraging. \u201cThanks for throwing me this party.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve made a face of protest. \u201cI didn\u2019t <em>throw you a party,</em> Munson. I said you could throw yourself one at my house,\u201d he corrected into his beer can. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you say, Stevie,\u201d Eddie smirked, taking a sip of his own drink. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you let me play my tapes, though.\u201d Steve nodded, the sound of some rock band blaring through the boombox he\u2019d brought down. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, figured it\u2019s not much of a birthday party if the birthday boy doesn\u2019t even get to listen to music he likes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Harrington. I won\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re secretly thoughtful to the freaks,\u201d he clinked his can against Steve\u2019s, the backs of their hands brushing together as he did so. His rings were discarded today, probably not wanting to lose them in the pool, and Steve found himself examining the boniness of Eddie\u2019s hands. They seemed somehow even bigger without the jewelry, and a part of Steve wondered if his own hands were smaller. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t invite a girl or something. No post-grad-cheerleader to warm your troubled heart?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve looked at Eddie\u2019s face now, teasing at always but a part of him was still staring at Steve so intently it made his head swim a bit. He sighed, looking out across the pool where Robin, Vickie, and two of Vickie\u2019s friends talked in the deep end.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Fraid not. What about you? Any freaky Elvira types knocking at your door?\u201d Steve paused then, remembering his conversation with Robin. He glanced over at Eddie unsuredly before adding \u201cOr Draculas, maybe. Don\u2019t wanna assume.\u201d He hurriedly brought the can to his lips and took a long drink. Steve was looking at the water again, but he didn\u2019t miss the way Eddie\u2019s head snapped to look at him at this. The curiosity was eating him alive but he didn\u2019t dare turn to see what look was on Eddie\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>When the silence trudged on just a little longer than Steve anticipated, he began to panic. Had he said the wrong thing? Did Eddie take offense to him implying he might like guys? Shit, he should\u2019ve just asked Robin so he didn\u2019t stick his foot in his mouth.</p>\n<p>Eddie chuckled, snapping him out of his imminent spiral. Steve looked at him out of the corner of his eye as he took another sip. \u201cNo, unfortunately not. Well, a few girls have hit on me at the bar where the band plays.\u201d He chuckled again. \u201cBut I\u2019m not really looking for Elviras.\u201d <em>But I\u2019m not really looking for Elviras.</em> The words rang out in Steve\u2019s head, and he found himself smiling at Eddie, who had busied himself with a loose string on his swim trunks. If Steve didn\u2019t know better he\u2019d say Eddie looked downright nervous. A sudden urgency for Steve to show he was cool with what was said flooded him. </p>\n<p>\u201cGuess that limits your options quite a bit,\u201d Steve stated in a way that he hoped was sympathetic. Eddie scoffed, eyes widening a bit as he nodded, staring out across the pool.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite,\u201d he huffed a noncommittal laugh. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. Gives me more time to annoy you and Robin,\u201d Eddie grinned at Steve, shoving him hardily with his shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd thank god for that,\u201d Steve muttered sarcastically, but he could feel the smile on his face as looked back at Eddie, who was watching his own feet kick lazily in the pool. The lights reflected and danced in his ebony eyes, making the usual mischief in them appear to bounce with an intensity that almost supplied it a personality of its own. It was\u2026 entrancing, Steve thought, and he had never really met someone he wanted to use that word for.</p>\n<p>He heard snickering, and looked up to see the bandmates laughing and whispering like a group of school girls as they observed Steve and Eddie. Anger and embarrassment fought for first place inside Steve, jaw clenching as he forced himself to look down at his beer can, but he didn\u2019t miss the bothered look on Eddie\u2019s face as he looked between Steve and the band. </p>\n<p>He hated them being there, not because of them personally, but because it made Steve feel so watched. Like they were critiquing his every breath and there was nothing he could do to win. And because of that, he felt like he couldn\u2019t be his usual self around his friends, which was getting him down more than anything. He briefly wondered if this was how he made people feel in high school, whether intentionally or not, and it made him wanna crawl inside himself. </p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s Eddie\u2019s birthday party. Don\u2019t make a scene.</em> He repeated to himself silently, head shaking in an attempt to brush off the anger. </p>\n<p> Eddie had been looking at him for a moment, then something like determination washed over him as his eyes settled on his bandmates, and before Steve knew it he was standing up and walking over to them, water dripping from his lower legs. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d His voice was more authoritative than Steve had ever heard it, and it took him by complete surprise. It also caught the attention of Robin, Vickie, and their friends, who paused their conversation to observe what was happening. Robin looked at Steve, raising an eyebrow. Steve just shrugged off her worry from across the pool.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington was nice enough to give us a place to party, drink, and use a fuckin\u2019 pool of all things\u2013 and you repay him by gossiping like bitter high schoolers?\u201d Eddie addressed his bandmates, who were all silent. Steve couldn\u2019t do anything but watch. \u201cEither shape up or go home, boys. Maybe if you weren\u2019t such killjoys we\u2019d get invited to more parties, yeah?\u201d The guys looked among each other, as if having a silent debate, before all muttering out defeated apologies.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re apologizing to me,\u201d Eddie said before looking over his shoulder and pointing at Steve, who\u2019s face heated as he embodied a deer caught in headlights. \u201cApologize to <em>him.</em>\u201d </p>\n<p> They all chorused, albeit begrudgingly, their various \u201cSorry\u2019s.\u201d But Eddie wasn\u2019t satisfied, shaking his head. </p>\n<p> \u201cNo, no, no. Like you mean it. C\u2019mon, after me,\u201d Steve had to bite back a smile he deemed inappropriate as Eddie scolded them like school children. \u201c<em>I\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Harrington.</em>\u201d They all looked between each other again, before looking at Eddie to see if he was serious. Eddie must have made a face at them because, with almost a collective sigh, they called over to Steve, louder but just as dejected in tone. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Harrington,\u201d he had to admit, their clear humiliation was making it hard not to enjoy this little performance Eddie orchestrated. Eddie, seemingly satisfied, walked back over to Steve, who was doing his best to contain his laughter behind his beer can, but clearly failing if the amusement on Eddie\u2019s face was any indicator. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to defend my honor, Munson,\u201d Steve grinned. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy, I can handle myself.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a big boy,\u201d and even though they were his own words repeated back to him, it managed to heat Steve\u2019s face all the same. \u201cBut I wanted to. They were being assholes just because they finally had the chance to be. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Steve looked over at Eddie, who returned his gaze intently. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie tucked his chin into the palm of his hand, batting his eyelashes dramatically, as if to mimic a gossiping school girl. Steve gave a snort, but continued. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere is <em>one</em> perk to hosting, and it is that I don\u2019t have to drive,\u201d Steve stood up from the pool. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get myself something stronger to drink. Want one?\u201d And for a fraction of a second\u2013 so brief he couldn\u2019t be sure if he actually saw it\u2013 he thought disappointment flashed in Eddie\u2019s eyes. What Eddie could be disappointed over, he had no idea, so he let it go, deciding he must have been mistaken. Eddie\u2019s smile was back on his face too quick to second guess, anyway. </p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Eddie scoffed. \u201cYou can\u2019t mix drinks worth a shit. I\u2019ll make us something actually stomachable.\u201d Steve rolled his eyes at this, but stuck out his hand for Eddie to take, which he did, their beer cans forgotten by the pool. They dried what they could of their legs and Steve led the way to his kitchen, large and pristine. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw the drinks everyone else brought out there, right?\u201d Eddie questioned, gesturing behind his shoulder to the direction of the pool. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you seemed eager to prove you know your way around a bottle,\u201d Steve pointed at Eddie before opening a set of cabinets next to him, revealing an expansive array of expensive alcohol. \u201cI\u2019m just giving you some better shit to work with. No blaming cheap liquor.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cA man after my own heart,\u201d Eddie fanned himself exaggeratedly as he sidled up next to Steve, inspecting his supply. And soon, he got to work, taking the two red cups Steve passed him. He was even using some of the fancy stuff that wasn\u2019t alcohol, so Steve never bothered to touch it. </p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, I figured it\u2019s not really a birthday if you can\u2019t get reasonably plastered, so\u2026\u201d Steve crossed his arms, leaning against the island behind him as he watched Eddie make his concoctions. \u201cFeel free to stay the night. We got a guest bedroom,\u201d Steve\u2019s offer earned a curious look from Eddie. \u201cPlus, I owe you for letting me crash after the movie.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie gave a dismissive wave, turning back to his drink making. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me for anything, Harrington. But I will take you up on the offer,\u201d he turned to look at Steve for a brief, but genuine moment as he said \u201cThank you.\u201d It was then that they heard a shrill giggle, which they both recognized as Robin\u2019s, one that rarely occurs when she\u2019s sober. </p>\n<p>They shared a look, chuckling amongst themselves at this. \u201cMaybe Robin and Vickie need that guest bedroom more than me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you can always crash in my room. And anyway,\u201d Steve gestured between himself and Eddie. \u201cIf <em>you\u2019re</em> not driving them, and <em>I\u2019m</em> certainly not driving them, they\u2019re kinda stranded here whether they like it or not.\u201d Steve gave a shrug, Eddie giving an agreeing smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m no genius but I do believe that math adds up,\u201d he grinned, pressing a full cup into Steve\u2019s hand. \u201cGive me a taste, sugar,\u201d he did a little shoulder shimmy with his request, Steve giving him a weird look that he couldn't help but accompany with a smile. He obliged, sampling the masterpiece. Eddie was excitedly tapping the tips of his fingers together in a sort of quite clap, clearly eager for Steve\u2019s thoughts. </p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit, Munson,\u201d Steve\u2019s head lolled in minor shock. He had to give it to the guy. \u201cI didn\u2019t know alcohol could taste this good.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAhhh?\u201d Eddie gestured to the air as if to say \u201cSee?\u201d He picked up his own drink, giving it a sip. \u201cTold you I was good.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Steve admitted, taking a long sip of his drink and nodding in approval. \u201cWe should probably go back out, but don\u2019t tell them about the good alcohol. Our little secret,\u201d Steve sent Eddie a wink before striding back towards the door leading to the pool. He paused momentarily, looking back at Eddie when he noticed he wasn\u2019t following. \u201cYou comin\u2019, Munson?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah, yeah,\u201d Eddie picked up the pace, following Steve back to the pool. The sight waiting for them was certainly not one Steve expected, and from the stunned look on Eddie\u2019s face, he didn\u2019t either. </p>\n<p>Vickie was on top of Robin\u2019s shoulders in the pool, chicken fighting with the tiniest member of Eddie\u2019s band, who was on the shoulders of one of the guys Vickie brought. And Vickie was winning. </p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Vickie, kill \u2018em!\u201d Robin yelled, sounding blood thirsty below Vickie. Steve cocked his head in mild concern, but decided it was probably a pretty healthy way to let off some steam.</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s bandmate was pushed into the water, Vickie letting out a triumphant scream and raising her hands in victory. A surprisingly\u2026 primal side, that Steve had not expected her to have. \u201cMaybe she can handle Robin afterall,\u201d Steve commented, finding he was both newly impressed by and fearful of Vickie. </p>\n<p>\u201cVickie, Robin!\u201d Steve called out as he and Eddie approached the pool. \u201cYou\u2019re staying in the guest bedroom.\u201d He turned to Eddie before saying, quieter, \u201cExecutive decision.\u201d Eddie nodded in agreement, sipping his drink. </p>\n<p>\u201cAw, man,\u201d Eddie said, disappointment clear in his voice. \u201cI forgot the most important ingredient for our drinks.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d Steve asked, looking down at his drink before returning his eyes to Eddie. \u201cIt\u2019s already so good, though. Do we really need it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, man, it\u2019s a total game changer. Here,\u201d Eddie held out his free hand. \u201cI\u2019ll go put it in real quick.\u201d Steve shrugged, handing him his drink before turning back to the pool.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you guys know Munson\u2019s really good at making dri\u2013\u201d but he never got to finish his sentence, as two firm hands plowed into his back and suddenly water was crashing around him. He quickly breached the surface, shaking his head and wiping the water out of his eyes. \u201cWhat the hell, Munson?!\u201d He blinked up at Eddie, who was laughing to himself in accomplishment. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. It\u2019s a pool party. Someone\u2019s gotta get pushed in once or it basically didn\u2019t even happen,\u201d Eddie justified, grin still plastered to his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it had to be me? The guy who just offered you my bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>what?</em>\u201d Robin piped up from where she was treading water next to him, eyes wide. </p>\n<p>Steve gave a small shake of his head, waving dismissively at her, \u201cNot like that.\u201d He turned back to Eddie. \u201cAt least help me out. I didn\u2019t even get a buzz going from your stupidly good drink.\u201d Steve swam closer and reached out his hand, Eddie still smiling smugly as he took it. But now a smug smirk crossed Steve\u2019s face, Eddie\u2019s instantly falling in turn as Steve now had a firm grasp on his calloused hands. Steve tutted at Eddie. \u201cEddie, Eddie, Eddie,\u201d He chastised playfully. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a very foolish boy,\u201d and with that Steve kicked off the side of the wall, yanking Eddie in practically on top of him, but he managed to move mostly out of the way at the last second. Eddie surfaced a few moments later, flicking back his long hair so he could see Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou fight dirty, Harrington,\u201d he said, slightly out of breath as they treaded water.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shoved me in the pool first, <em>sugar,</em>\u201d Steve teased, triumphant smile still not quite off his face.</p>\n<p>The night went on, the bandmates even intermingling with Vickie and her friends. Those staying over continued to drink without care, and before they knew it, it was just the four of them drying off by the pool, all reasonably drunk and tired. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, we got plenty of bathrooms for everyone to rinse off in. I say we turn in,\u201d Steve offered, his eyelids heavy with sleep. He wasn\u2019t sure he was gonna even be able to make it through the shower. The group rallied their agreement, and shuffled inside, Steve leading the way upstairs. </p>\n<p>\u201cLadies, this is your room. That\u2019s a bathroom, there\u2019s another shower downstairs,\u201d Steve gestured to the respective doors down the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll bring some clothes you can sleep in, but they\u2019ll probably be baggy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as I don\u2019t have to sleep in my jeans, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Robin said groggily. Steve opened his door, motioning for Eddie to follow. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you something to sleep in, too. You can use my shower. The towel hung up is mine but there are folded ones in there that are clean,\u201d Steve explained, voice quiet with tiredness as he plucked out enough clothes for his three friends. He gave Eddie his before dipping out of the room to say goodnight to the girls. \u201cLet me know if you guys need anything,\u201d he gave them some of his older shirts and sweatpants with good drawstrings. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get pregnant,\u201d Robin said seriously, her eyes so heavy they almost looked closed. The clock on the wall showed it was nearly four AM. They\u2019d certainly be having a late morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo promises,\u201d Steve deadpanned before patting Robin on the shoulder and disappearing back into his room. He heard the shower running from behind the bathroom door, which was connected to his room. He grabbed a pair of gym shorts and took this time to shower in his parents\u2019 bathroom, and when he returned Eddie was already out. </p>\n<p>He sat on the foot of Steve\u2019s queen-sized, towel hanging around his shoulders and hair hanging in curly strings around his head. Steve was the shirtless one this time, and he couldn\u2019t help but think the green of his shirt looked nice on Eddie. It was a shame he didn\u2019t wear more color. \u201cYou kept it,\u201d was all he said, looking over at Steve as he closed his bedroom door. Steve furrowed his brows. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I keep?\u201d he asked, sitting beside Eddie on the bed and following his gaze. Immediately he realized what he was talking about. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy vest,\u201d a smile that wasn\u2019t out of jest or Steve\u2019s expense tugged on Eddie\u2019s lips. Genuine instead of joking, for once. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. You can have it back,\u201d Steve said, realizing he probably should\u2019ve returned it awhile ago. Was it weird that he didn\u2019t? He couldn\u2019t exactly say he forgot. He\u2019d in fact thought about it ad nauseam, but after a while of debating if he should give it back, it had been so long he decided just to hold onto it. </p>\n<p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s cool. You can keep it. I have a backup,\u201d Eddie said, and Steve couldn\u2019t believe he was friends with someone who owned a <em>backup denim vest.</em> \u201cYou looked hot in it, anyway.\u201d The words reverberated around Steve's brain, rattling around in his head which had now become devoid of other thoughts. He dealt with it the only way he knew how; teasing Eddie, who had a mortified look on his face, as if he hadn\u2019t meant to reveal what he did. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you just admit I looked hot in it?\u201d Steve smirked, Eddie hiding his face in his hands but not before Steve could see how red it was. \u201cOh, Munson, how the tables have turned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what? Plenty of people look good in denim vests,\u201d Eddie defended. \u201cThey\u2019re a staple for any fashion-forward individual.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Steve wagged his pointer finger at Eddie, reveling in a rare moment where he could get the infuriatingly self-assured Eddie Munson embarrassed. \u201cYou said I looked <em>hot</em> in it. That is <em>distinguishably better</em> than just looking good.\u201d He had honestly forgotten what it was like to be the teaser rather than the teased since Eddie started hanging around more. It was nice to be back on top, Steve thought. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, Harrington! So you wear a vest well\u2013 we should be getting to sleep anyway,\u201d Eddie tried to change the subject, Steve grinning before he could even get out his next sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wow!</em>\u201d He said with exaggerated shock. \u201cAnd now you just can\u2019t wait to get me into bed\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright\u2013\u201d Eddie pulled his hands away and gave Steve a look like that was a stretch, but the latter continued anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable. You know, you men only want one thing and it is disgusting,\u201d Steve deadpanned, satisfied with himself when he saw Eddie having to bite back a smile while trying to maintain his annoyance. </p>\n<p>\u201cUhuh. We\u2019re a bunch of dogs,\u201d Eddie agreed with a shake of his head, as if he couldn\u2019t believe it. Neither of them could seem to wipe the smile off their faces as they crawled into bed, Steve turning off the light. This left both of them lying on their backs in silence, staring up at the ceiling for quite awhile. Steve had been seconds away from falling asleep, but now he was wide awake. Eddie\u2019s breathing never slowed, either, so it seemed he was having the same issue as Steve. When Eddie spoke, it was almost too soft to properly break the silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d Steve searched for what Eddie could be talking about, but for the life of him couldn\u2019t figure out what he was referencing. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Neither of them seemed keen to break the calm in the room, Steve\u2019s voice barely above a whisper. They both had a tone one only found in those dark hours of dawn, when everything was softer around the edges. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem so\u2026 well-put together,\u201d Steve could almost hear Eddie swallow. \u201cAfter everything. I wish I could bounce back like you.\u201d This stunned Steve into a brief silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve quite come back yet,\u201d Steve said honestly, his voice almost croaking to admit it. \u201cIf anything, I thought you were the one handling everything absurdly well,\u201d Eddie scoffed at this, but Steve doubled down. \u201cNo, it\u2019s true. You\u2019re certainly handling it better than I did after the first time around. Those were the worst nightmares I had in my life.\u201d </p>\n<p> There was a long pause before Eddie spoke again, voice even smaller than before. \u201cDid the nightmares ever get better?\u201d Steve turned his head to see Eddie looking at him, big brown eyes full of hope even visible in the sliver of moonlight shining through Steve\u2019s curtains. It felt like a punch in the heart that Steve didn\u2019t have a better answer. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor a little bit. But then\u2026 something would happen again\u2026 or, I\u2019d just get worse for seemingly no reason,\u201d Steve didn\u2019t know why he was being so honest. He never found himself talking about it much, even with Robin. It felt like he had to be the one to put on a brave face, even though none of them ever did anything to suggest such a thing. But sometimes it\u2019s all Steve felt he knew how to do. \u201cSorry. That\u2019s probably not what you wanted to hear.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it is,\u201d Eddie said, to Steve\u2019s confusion. \u201cI wanted the truth. I\u2019m tired of hearing <em>\u2019it\u2019ll be okay,\u2019</em> and all that bullshit,\u201d Eddie gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cBecause clearly it might not. All of you say it\u2019s come back more than once now\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Saying it\u2019s gonna be okay like any of us have any fucking idea what could happen doesn\u2019t help. It just makes me feel\u2026\u201d Eddie shook his head lightly, brows furrowing as he looked somewhere far off. \u201cCrazy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve supplied, gaining the attention of Eddie\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Eddie gave him a small smile then. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot a very fun house guest, am I?\u201d Eddie chuckled, earning a sympathetic snort from Steve.</p>\n<p> \u201cIf you, uh,\u201d Steve swallowed thickly, not quite able to meet Eddie\u2019s eyes as he spoke now. \u201cIf you ever need to feel less crazy. I\u2019m here.\u201d He chanced a glance at Eddie, and it was a mistake because he was smiling at him with <em>so much</em> in his eyes Steve felt like he was going to be crushed under the weight of it. </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s pleasant smile cracked into a deeper grin. \u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for me to feel less crazy, but I\u2019ll keep that in mind, Harrington. Thank you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone to join you in insanity then, maybe,\u201d Stever offered, realizing that was a much more doable request for him to fill. </p>\n<p> Eddie gave a low, quiet whistle. \u201cWatch out, world. Steve Harrington looks good in a vest <em>and</em> he\u2019s a <em>poet.</em>\u201d Steve rolled his eyes, a smile on his face as he looked back up at the ceiling. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, Munson. Goodnight,\u201d and with that, Steve shut his own eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cNight, Stevie.\u201d </p>\n<p>\"Oh, one more thing,\" Steve said, Eddie humming in question. \"Happy birthday, Eddie.\" </p>\n<p>Birds chirping and sun shining in Steve\u2019s eyes awoke him the next morning, pulling an annoyed groan from his throat as he squeezed his eyes tight, hand fisting in the bedspread next to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s grumpy,\u201d he heard from beside him. Steve opened one eye, and was met with the sight of Eddie smiling\u2013 smugly\u2013 at him. It was then that Steve realized he wasn\u2019t grabbing sheets, but rather his own shirt, which was attached to Eddie. Both eyes opened as embarrassment flooded him, sleep making his brain lag to catch up with reality. </p>\n<p>Eddie, who seemed like he might\u2019ve been awake for a little, saw this and gave a warm smile. Then, he did something that effectively shut down Steve\u2019s barely functioning brain. He took the top of Steve\u2019s hand gingerly in one of his, then Steve\u2019s thumb in the other, and proceeded to make it look like Steve\u2019s hand was talking while Eddie said, in a weird, scratchy demon voice: \u201cMornin\u2019, Stevie.\u201d He let Steve\u2019s hand fall back on his chest, still smiling that goofy smile as Steve tried to form words, but it currently felt like his stomach was taking off from JFK.</p>\n<p>Miraculously, he managed to snap out of it, rolling further onto his back and taking his hand with him as he rubbed sleep out of his eyes. He looked at the clock next to his side of the bed, and as he predicted, they had slept late, the numbers showing it was half past noon.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard the girls talking downstairs not too long ago. We should probably go before they burn your house down,\u201d Eddie pointed out, Steve letting out a quiet sigh. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlways the babysitter,\u201d he grumbled out, throat scratchy from the morning. When he looked back over Eddie was staring at him, more intensely than usual, and <em>god</em> if Steve wouldn\u2019t give everything in the world to be a mind reader right now, because <em>what is that look?</em> \u201cWhat?\u201d He asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d his eyes glanced up at Steve\u2019s hair. \u201cJust nice to know that isn\u2019t always perfect.\u201d And then, he <em>ruffled Steve\u2019s hair.</em> Steve groaned in protest, shooting him a look as Eddie rolled off the bed, dressed in Steve\u2019s shirt and shorts. The golden light illuminated his hair from behind, and it made the guy look downright angelic. Steve shook his head, blinking a few times before getting out of bed and quickly throwing on a shirt and leading them downstairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that them?\u201d Steve heard Robin say from the kitchen. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think they\u2026?\u201d Vickie trailed off, and a blush rushed straight to Steve\u2019s face. He was just glad he wasn\u2019t facing Eddie. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think we what?\u201d Steve loudly announced before they entered the kitchen. The girls stiffened slightly, as if caught doing something they shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 yacked,\u201d Robin supplied, looking at Vickie to back her up, which Vickie nodded enthusiastically. <em>Dangerous, those two,</em> Steve thought to himself as he gave Robin a scolding look. He began moving around the kitchen, pulling out things to make breakfast. </p>\n<p>\u201cNope. Too much experience to throw up that easy,\u201d Steve said over his shoulder. \u201cScrambled eggs and bacon fine, or am I gonna have to learn to make an omelet on the spot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Robin confirmed, his three friends sliding into the barstools pulled up to one side of the island. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Because I wasn\u2019t gonna do anything else, anyway,\u201d Steve shot her a sickly sweet smile before getting started on their breakfast. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, when did you say the Wheelers and the Byers get back?\u201d Robin asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cUhhh\u2026 last day of July. Why?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 today?\u201d Eddie said, causing Steve to whip around. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No,\u201d he challenged, walking over to a calendar on his wall and studying it. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy birthday\u2019s the thirtieth. That makes today the thirty-first, Harrington,\u201d Eddie commented, and Steve realized he was right. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder how long before Johnathan and Nancy have to go to college,\u201d Robin wondered aloud. </p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not till late August, at least,\u201d Vickie said, and Steve would wager she was right. It would be nice to see them a little before they left, Steve thought. He hadn\u2019t given much thought to Nancy after everything. As much as he brushed off Eddie\u2019s teasing, they definitely had a few weird moments during their time killing Vecna. But that was done. She was back with Johnathan, and when lives weren\u2019t at stake, Steve wasn\u2019t sure he was all too upset about that. They\u2019d dated when they were young, and honestly, Steve didn\u2019t want the drama of fighting for someone already in a relationship. </p>\n<p>The four of them ate their breakfast, talking about random things, or funny moments from last night, and before he knew it they were getting their things together, Eddie ready to take them home. Steve was walking them to Eddie\u2019s van when he realized something. </p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d he grabbed Eddie\u2019s jacket sleeve, everyone having changed into the clothes they wore over. Eddie stopped, giving him a quizzical look. \u201cI forgot something, wait right here.\u201d Steve ran back inside and bounded up his stairs, cursing himself for forgetting until now. <em>It\u2019s not even his birthday anymore,</em> he thought guiltily. He pulled open a drawer in his bedside table, retrieving the little green box tied with a simple black ribbon, and ran back downstairs.</p>\n<p>Eddie was leaning against his van, swinging his keys around idly, the girls inside already. He stood up a bit when Steve came back, a curious look on his face. Steve pulled the box out from behind his back, Eddie\u2019s eyes lighting up in clear surprise. </p>\n<p>\u201cI totally fuckin\u2019 spaced and didn\u2019t even give you your present. Sorry, Munson,\u201d Steve said genuinely, apologetically wincing at his own forgetfulness as he placed the box in Eddie\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got me a present?\u201d Eddie asked, voice more sheepish than Steve was used to. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to, ya know.\u201d Eddie began untying the ribbon and suddenly Steve felt nerves flood him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, I didn\u2019t know your size\u2026 so if it doesn\u2019t fit I have the receipt\u2013 or if you don\u2019t like it. You\u2013you don\u2019t have to like it,\u201d Steve was rambling. Something he had, as far as he could remember, essentially never done. \u201cI just didn\u2019t wanna get you nothing. Ya know, twenty one is a big birthday and all\u2013\u201d he cut himself off when Eddie opened the box, revealing a large, silver ring with a shield on it. Directly down the middle of the shield was a longsword. When Eddie looked back at him, it was the biggest smile Steve had ever seen the boy wear, and the anxiety he was feeling fell away all at once. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d and he didn\u2019t realize Eddie saying his first name would catch him so off guard. He shifted his feet, placing his arm up on the side of the van so he could lean against it. Steve was no expert, but this seemed like the good kind of speechless. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Steve asked, trying not to sound too eager, but admittedly he had spent a decent amount of time deciding on the right ring. No point in getting someone a gift they\u2019re gonna hate, after all. Eddie had been inspecting the jewelry, but he looked back up at Steve then. And <em>god,</em> Steve didn\u2019t know how one person could fit so much emotion in one set of eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Eddie chuckled, beaming as he slid on the ring. Steve let out a breath of relief when he saw it fit. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking sick, Stevie.\u201d And before Steve could prepare himself, Eddie was throwing his arms around his neck, tugging him into a tight hug. Steve\u2019s arm slid off the van and he stood there for a moment, stunned, before he wrapped his own arms around Eddie\u2019s waist. Eddie was warm and smelled like he usually did, sweet musk and a faint smell of smoke. Steve tucked his nose into Eddie\u2019s shoulder, surprised by the smell of vanilla that hung in his hair. He squeezed just a bit tighter, and then the hug came to an end. He couldn\u2019t tell if it lasted a second or thirty, but he found himself thinking it ended too soon regardless. </p>\n<p>Neither of them said anything for a second, Eddie just biting on his lip but unable to contain a smile. He shook his head slightly, chuckling to himself. About what, Steve didn\u2019t know. Eddie took the small box in his hand and tapped it to Steve\u2019s chest twice, muttering out \u201cSteve Harrington,\u201d in a way that could almost be awe. With that, he pulled open the driver\u2019s door and slid into his van. </p>\n<p>Steve stepped back from the van as it started up, a grin never leaving Eddie\u2019s face as he pulled out of the driveway. He saw a flash of a look from Robin, but they were gone before he really had a chance to figure out what she was trying to convey. He couldn't wipe the stupid smile off his face for quite some time after his friends\u2019 departure. </p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>If it wasn\u2019t Eddie coming in to annoy Steve on his shift, it was most certainly Dustin Henderson. Lucas and Max were there sometimes, but more often than not he could count on the short curly-haired boy to be talking rapidly about whatever topic he was zeroed in on. </p>\n<p>As was the case today, apparently. The bell jingled, and as soon as Steve saw that determined look in his eye, he knew he wasn\u2019t leaving this conversation without doing some child a favor. \u201cSteve,\u201d Dustin said, beelining for the checkout counter. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Steve sighed. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He asked flatly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel about carnivals?\u201d At this question, Robin came out from the back, an eyebrow raised at Dustin. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I feel about carnivals\u2013 Dustin, just get to the point,\u201d Steve said earnestly. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a whole,\u201d he gestured dismissively in the air, \u201cthing to try and get me on board.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need you to take us to the carnival. It\u2019s in town and Mike and Will just got back,\u201d Dustin smacked his hands on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect timing.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo? Ride your bikes,\u201d Steve countered. <em>First the babysitter, now the chaperone.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, it\u2019s on the edge of town. Plus, all of our parents are still pretty\u2026\u201d Dustin sighed. \u201cI guess they\u2019re still freaked out because, ya know, us almost dying again. For like. The millionth time. We wanna go at night for the haunted corn maze, but they won\u2019t let us unless we <em>specifically</em> have more than one adult with us.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, even if I say yes, I\u2019m only one person. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Steve deadpanned. </p>\n<p>\u201cJohnathan and Nancy agreed, too,\u201d Dustin added impatiently, as if Steve was getting hung up on the details.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d Steve steepled his fingers and pointed them at Dustin. \u201cYou want me to\u2013 once again\u2013 babysit you little goblins, but this time I have to <em>also</em> third-wheel with my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend?\u201d He raised his eyebrows at Dustin, trying to convey in his tone that this was ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Steve!\u201d Dustin clasped his hands together and held them up to him in desperation. \u201cThis whole strict parents thing is <em>really</em> getting in the way of a plan I got goin\u2019 on, and I need you to work with me here!\u201d His eyes lit up as they fell on Robin. \u201cLook! Bring Robin! Bring Eddie\u2013 I don\u2019t <em>care,</em> okay? I just need you there, my mom thinks you\u2019re an angel.\u201d </p>\n<p> Steve looked at Dustin with crossed arms and pursed lips as he debated. He took a glance at Robin, who was simply watching the interaction. She raised her eyebrows at him. He let out a sigh that slowly turned into a groan as he laid his attention back on Dustin. \u201cFine.\u201d Dustin fist pumped in triumph. \u201cOnly if Robin goes,\u201d Steve looked to his friend. </p>\n<p>\u201cCan I bring Vickie?\u201d She asked, Dustin furrowing his brows in curiosity. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you start hanging out with Vickie?\u201d He asked Robin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have lives outside of being your babysitter, Henderson,\u201d Steve swooped in. Dustin was a good kid, but he was, bless his excitable heart, a loud mouth. Steve understood why Robin didn\u2019t feel the need to tell the others. As far as he was aware, he and Eddie were the only ones who knew. Well, and Vickie, Steve supposed. </p>\n<p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Dustin rolled his eyes, giving. \u201cEddie won\u2019t stop blowing me off to hang out with you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not just me! Robin\u2019s there, too. Why aren\u2019t you blaming her?\u201d Steve defended. Dustin gave another roll of his eyes, shaking his head. </p>\n<p>He muttered something Steve couldn\u2019t quite make out, but he thought it sounded something along the lines of \u201cGod, another Mike and Will,\u201d before he started making his way to the door. \u201cI gotta go, but thanks! Pick us up at 7:30 tomorrow night\u2013 <em>sharp,</em>\u201d Dustin emphasized, one hand on the door. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get off until 8:30\u2013 aaand he\u2019s gone,\u201d Steve lolled his head in defeat, turning to Robin with a shake of his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Cory and scare him into taking your shift,\u201d Robin said, hopping up on the counter and beginning to flip through the employee contact info. </p>\n<p>\u201cGod, if you\u2019re taking Vickie I just went from third wheel to fifth wheel,\u201d Steve whined. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust invite Eddie,\u201d Robin shrugged, punching in what Steve assumed was Cory\u2019s number. </p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno\u2026 Does the carnival really seem like something he\u2019d wanna do?\u201d Steve asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Robin glanced around briefly. \u201cEddie acts like he was born in a carnival. Besides,\u201d she shrugged again. \u201cYou\u2019re asking.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve furrowed his brows before asking \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Cory?\u201d Robin\u2019s tone changed to one of customer service as Cory apparently picked up. She continued in a perfectly polite tone, a wide smile on her face. \u201cHey, it\u2019s Robin, from work. Remember when I said it\u2019d be awfully hard for you to be a famous keyboardist if I broke all your fingers? Yeah? Well, it\u2019s time we revisit that conversation.\u201d Steve watched with deep concern, but also an equal amount of fascination. He allowed her to continue. \u201cI need you to take Steve Harrington\u2019s closing shift tomorrow.\u201d </p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>\n<em>Steve shouldn\u2019t be here. The Starcourt Mall had been burned down for quite some time now. Yet, Steve found himself standing in the middle of the mall, staring up at the Mind Flayer, standing tall and very much alive. It was holding someone high in the air, tearing into them with its multiple limbs. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Right, it\u2019s tearing into Billy Hargrove. Steve knew this. He remembered feeling bad for Max. How does he remember feeling bad if it\u2019s only just now happening? His eyes focused in on the limp form. Something isn\u2019t right. The long, curly hair that hung in the air was not the dirty blond of Billy Hargrove. It was brown, and there was a sickeningly familiar denim vest and leather jacket.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Horror sunk deep in Steve\u2019s stomach, his knees buckling underneath him as he realized what he was witnessing was Eddie Munson\u2019s agonizing death. A scream ripped through his throat; \u201cNO!\u201d</em> </p>\n<p><em>He\u2019d never meant something with so much of his being, the only thought that his entire body could muster being \u2018no.\u2019 This couldn\u2019t be happening. Steve doubled over onto the ground, wanting nothing more but to run forward and do</em> something. Anything. <em>But his legs were lead, as if he were a figurine fixed to the spot. Motionless. Useless.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Steve watched in abject horror as the Mind Flayer released Eddie, and his body dropped through the air, sinking like a rock into a lake. He hit the ground with a sickening crack.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201dEDDIE!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Steve shot bolt upright, gasping for air, chest heaving and heart pounding with no sign of stopping. He wiped his forehead, looking frantically around his room. <em>Good,</em> he thought. He was in his room. A cold sweat covered every inch of his body, and his throat felt raw and scratchy. </p>\n<p>Struggling to catch his breath, his body was still shaking with adrenaline as he tried to convince himself none of that was real. His eyes rested on a denim vest hanging off the back of his chair. Relief flooded him in that moment, panicked breaths slowing into deep, languid inhales. <em>Eddie\u2019s,</em> was all his brain could supply, but it was enough.</p>\n<p>Steve ran a hand over his face, taking one final deep breath. His body moved before his brain even made the decision, grabbing the vest off the chair and flopping back onto the bed with it clutched to his chest. After a moment of debating if he could live with the shame, he slowly brought the tough material to his face, and took a long inhale. </p>\n<p>A sense of calm spread through Steve as Eddie\u2019s now familiar scent filled his senses. He could smell the sweet, earthy cologne he used, and the vanilla that clung to his hair. At this, Steve couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, endlessly thankful that it had all just been a nightmare. And then, all at once it hit him what he was doing, and he lowered the fabric. <em>A little pathetic, Harrington,</em> he scolded himself, then shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said aloud to his empty room. \u201cA lot pathetic.\u201d </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t return Eddie\u2019s vest to the chair until morning.</p>\n<p>Steve stared at himself in the mirror, running his hands through his hair for the millionth time in an attempt to get it to fall <em>ever so slightly</em> different. He let out a frustrated sigh, unsatisfied and deciding to give up on his hair, he turned his attention to his outfit. It felt too\u2026 plain. Just a white t-shirt with blue stripes tucked into dark blue jeans and some white trainers. It was a warm summer night, as well, so no jacket would be needed.</p>\n<p>As his eyes glanced around his room, they settled on the vest he had found comfort in the previous night. His eyebrows perked up in debate. <em>Munson did say you looked hot in it\u2026</em> Surely, if it could get Eddie to pay him a compliment, he looked decent enough to wear it out.</p>\n<p>He shrugged on the denim vest, taking a moment to appraise himself in the mirror. Steve had to admit, he did like how it made his shoulders look. Giving a final tug on the lapel, he grabbed his wallet and car keys and headed out to pick up the children. </p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>Steve pulled into the dirt parking lot of the pop-up carnival, Dustin, Lucas, and Max in his backseat. Jonathan and Nancy were bringing Will, Mike, and El. He got out of the car, the kids following suit, and saw that everyone else had already arrived and was waiting in the parking lot for them. Including Eddie, Robin, and Vickie.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you 7:30 <em>sharp,</em> Harrington,\u201d Dustin scolded, looking him up and down. His brows furrowed for a moment. \u201cIs that Eddie\u2019s vest?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re welcome by the way,\u201d Steve deflected, giving Dustin a soft shove forward as they met up with everyone else. There was a guy Steve didn\u2019t recognize standing beside Jonathan, with just about the longest hair he\u2019d ever seen and an outfit made up of loud, mix-matched patterns. </p>\n<p>\u201cLong-time no-see, Wheelers, Byers, and\u2026\u201d Steve landed on the long haired guy, pointing. \u201cNope, definitely don\u2019t know you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m Argyle, man,\u201d the guy smiled, lids looking so heavy that if he stood still enough he might have looked asleep. He held out his hand, which Steve took with a smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying with me until we head to college,\u201d Jonathan explained, Steve nodding as it made more sense. </p>\n<p>\u201cArgyle actually helped with the whole Vecna thing,\u201d Mike piped up. \u201cYou guys just didn\u2019t get to meet.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well, welcome to freak city,\u201d Steve nodded, Argyle chuckling with a lazy smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood to see you, Steve,\u201d it was Nancy who spoke this time, giving Steve a small smile, which he returned. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou too, Nance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this lovely,\u201d Dustin clapped his hands together, as if they were failing to stick to a schedule. \u201cNow can we please go in?\u201d Everyone started heading towards the ticket booth, the older kids leading the back. </p>\n<p>\u201cNice vest, Steve,\u201d Robin commented in that pointed way she did. \u201cNow, where have I seen that before?\u201d Steve rolled his eyes at her. </p>\n<p>\u201cRobin, Vickie,\u201d Steve greeted, smiling more genuinely at Vickie, while giving Robin a look that said to shut it. A smug smile remained on her face. </p>\n<p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Eddie said, sidling up beside Steve and slinging an arm around his shoulder. A trill ran up Steve\u2019s spine. \u201cGive the guy a vest and don\u2019t even get a hello.\u201d Eddie looked at Robin and Vickie with mock disbelief, gesturing to Steve. \u201cCan you believe him?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes, hoping it didn\u2019t show how much their proximity was throwing him off. \u201cHello, Munson.\u201d He also couldn\u2019t wipe the smile twitching at his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington,\u201d Eddie grinned widely, glancing him up and down. \u201cLovely as ever,\u201d and with that he slid his leather-clad arm off of Steve\u2019s shoulders. Steve simply shook his head, still smiling to himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are closer than I remember,\u201d Nancy commented, her arm hooked on Johnathan\u2019s elbow. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well. Munson is\u2026 persistent,\u201d Steve supplied. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you didn\u2019t say \u2018annoying\u2019!\u201d Eddie said with mock enthusiasm before turning to Nancy and stage-whispering \u201cThat\u2019s a big step in our friendship.\u201d Nancy and Johnathan chuckled at this. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe night\u2019s still young,\u201d Steve teased, all of them buying some tickets. The kids began running off, Steve\u2019s hands on his hips as he shouted, feebly, \u201cBe back here by eleven\u2013 Hey! I\u2019m too young for this hair to be graying!\u2013 Nope. There they go.\u201d Steve sighed, letting his hands flop by his sides in defeat. He turned to Eddie, shaking his head. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna kill me, Munson. Survive demons from another dimension\u2013 multiple times\u2013 and some kids are gonna kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll you can do is embrace the chaos, Harrington,\u201d he gave a reassuring pat to Steve\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you think they got, like, food here?\u201d Argyle asked, looking around aimlessly.</p>\n<p>Steve raised his eyebrows. \u201cAt a carnival? Yeah, I think you\u2019re in luck, dude,\u201d Steve pointed over to a line of food booths. </p>\n<p>Argyle\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cAlright, funnel cake,\u201d and he started walking off. </p>\n<p>Jonathan turned to Steve, nodding at Argyle. \u201cThat\u2019s who I\u2019m really babysitting. Will and El will be fine.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet up with you guys at the games,\u201d Nancy said, she and Jonathan following after Argyle. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard the lady,\u201d Robin said, gesturing to some games nearby with a bunch of assorted stuffed animals as prizes. \u201cI wanna play some games!\u201d Robin grabbed Vickie by the hand and tugged her along, Eddie simply shrugging at Steve before following, leaving Steve to do the same lest he be alone. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat Argyle guy seems cool,\u201d Eddie mused as they walked up to a skee-ball esque game, but without the ramp. A no doubt underpaid teen with a dead look in their eyes leaned against the side, chewing gum. Robin and Vickie were throwing darts at a booth next to them. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow how did I know immediately he\u2019d be your kind of company,\u201d Steve teased, sliding the teen a ticket and getting a ball in return. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have three tries,\u201d the teen said in a bored tone. Steve lined up his shot. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou just know me so well,\u201d Eddie smirked, watching as Steve made it into one of the harder to reach holes, biting his lip in small victory. \u201cSeriously, though. I\u2019ll have to invite that guy to the trailer.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Steve said, taking his second shot. It sunk into a middle hole. \u201cThat\u2019s code for \u2018smoke so much weed our legs don\u2019t work,\u2019 right?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not every day I meet someone who can keep up with me,\u201d Eddie raised his hands in defense.</p>\n<p>Steve snorted. \u201cHow do you know I can\u2019t keep up with you?\u201d He glanced at Eddie before taking his final shot, getting it in the middle again. He didn't know if it was in his head, but Eddie seemed to be watching him a little extra tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your pick of these,\u201d the teen gestured to some medium sized stuffed animals hanging above him. </p>\n<p>Steve spotted a frog. \u201cThat one,\u201d he pointed to the stuffed frog, before saying to Eddie \u201cRobin loves frogs.\u201d He took the frog from the teen, thanking him briefly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever even smoked before, Harrington?\u201d Eddie questioned as they walked over to Robin and Vickie. </p>\n<p>\u201cRobin, look,\u201d he held up the frog when he got her attention. \u201cIt\u2019s a frog,\u201d he said simply, handing it to her. A smile lit up her face as she accepted the gift.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Steve. I\u2019ll call him Eugene,\u201d she mused to herself, Vickie smiling widely at her as she examined the stuffed frog. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, no, Munson,\u201d he turned his attention back to Eddie. \u201cI haven\u2019t smoked weed before. I just didn\u2019t like you <em>assuming</em> I hadn\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie raised his eyebrows, chuckling a bit in disbelief. \u201cBut\u2026 I was right,\u201d he pointed out, Steve waving his hand dismissively. </p>\n<p>\u201cBesides the point,\u201d Steve said, before continuing matter-of-factly. \u201cYou\u2019ve deeply offended me on this day. How will you atone for your sins?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Eddie hummed, making a show of thinking before his eyes fell back on Steve. \u201cI could always offer to break your weed-virginity?\u201d Eddie suggested, Steve\u2019s face half way between a smile and a grimace at his wording. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you promise not to call it that again, deal,\u201d Steve chuckled, holding out his hand. Eddie looked at it for a second before shaking it. </p>\n<p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Eddie chuckled. As his grasp loosened on Steve\u2019s hand, Steve spotted the ring he gave him glinting up at him from Eddie\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>Excitement got the better of Steve as he grabbed Eddie\u2019s hand back to get a better look. \u201cHey, you\u2019re wearing it,\u201d Steve said with genuine surprise, a small smile on his face. \u201cYou actually liked it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie gave him a questioning look. \u201cWas that up for debate until now?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve shrugged, letting Eddie\u2019s hand fall. \u201cI dunno. I\u2019ve told people I liked plenty of gifts that I didn't.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen, in case it wasn\u2019t clear,\u201d Eddie held up his hand, wiggling his fingers. \u201cI <em>actually</em> like it, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, c\u2019mon!\u201d Robin interrupted, grabbing both of them by the wrists and leading them towards one of those games with a bunch of mounted water guns where you race against each other. Jonathan, Nancy, and Argyle were already waiting for them by the game, Argyle shoveling funnel cake into his mouth like he hadn\u2019t seen food in days. </p>\n<p>Steve took a seat next to Jonathan, Eddie on the other side of him as they all got ready to shoot. The game started and so did the yelling. Eddie started shoving Steve to throw him off, earning a cry of exaggerated disgust from the latter. </p>\n<p>\u201cCheater!\u201d He accused, shoving him back. </p>\n<p>\u201cGotta fight dirty!\u201d Eddie laughed, but despite his attempts, he was losing miserably in comparison to Steve, who was neck and neck with Johnathan. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust like old times, Byers,\u201d he teased, grateful when Jonathan laughed, as he was briefly worried it wouldn\u2019t be taken as a joke. </p>\n<p>In the end, Jonathan won a stuffed giraffe for Nancy, earning him a hug and kiss on the cheek from the latter. The group collectively moved further down the lane of games, the couples, as expected, falling into their own conversations. This was why Steve hadn\u2019t wanted to come without another friend, and he was grateful to have Eddie as a distraction. He didn\u2019t blame his coupled friends for getting wrapped up in each other, obviously, but a night of Steve sitting around in silence while slightly-too-intimate conversations were had around him sounded horrible. </p>\n<p>They came to a pause so Robin could try and knock down some milk jars for a giant octopus. Steve wandered to a basketball booth across from it, a simple hoop-shooting game, and his eyes fell on one of the prizes. A tiny, palm-sized stuffed bat with floppy wings. \u201cMunson, don\u2019t you like bats?\u201d Steve pointed, raising his eyebrows. Eddie walked over, face lighting up at the small, toy creature. </p>\n<p>\u201cAdorable,\u201d Eddie commented, looking at Steve with big eyes. \u201cI\u2019m unfortunately shit at basketball. Plus, they make these things impossible by making the hoops smaller,\u201d he nodded at the hoop, which was actually noticeably smaller than a normal one. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well I\u2019m <em>not</em> shit at basketball,\u201d Steve said, already giving the worker his ticket. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t make it impossible, just harder.\u201d Eddie put up his hands, as if to say \u2018excuse me.\u2019 </p>\n<p>Steve lined up the shot, and managed to sink the first two, meaning he only needed one more. He missed the next two, but on his final chance made his final shot, twirling around with a smug smile. \u201cStill got it, baby!\u201d He preened, getting the bat from the attendant and presenting it to Eddie triumphantly. </p>\n<p>Eddie beamed as he took the bat from Steve. \u201cYou spoil me, Harrington,\u201d he said with a dramatic gesture. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you gonna name it?\u201d Steve asked as they joined up with the others, Vickie quickly gaining quite the collection of stuffed animals. </p>\n<p>\u201cOzzy, obviously,\u201d Eddie said matter of factly, like Steve shouldn\u2019t have had to ask. </p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he smiled, the group walking slowly. They ended up migrating to some tables, everyone else finally gaining an appetite. Argyle voiced that he was, miraculously despite eating multiple funnel cakes, still hungry. </p>\n<p>When they arrived at these tables, they actually spotted two of the kids, and instantly Steve\u2019s babysitter instincts went into overdrive. He scanned the area, including all the visible food lines, and saw none of the other kids. </p>\n<p>\u201cWheeler! Byers!\u201d Steve scolded from where he was holding a container of large fries. He marched his way over, the two boys looking at him with wide, fearful eyes. Steve furrowed his brows a bit, used to never being taken seriously when trying to keep everyone safe. \u201cWhy are you two alone? Did all of you really split up? Safety in numbers\u2013\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Mike rolled his eyes. \u201cThe others just totally ditched us in the corn maze.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it was really weird,\u201d Will chimed in. \u201cOne second they were there and then, poof. All four of them were gone.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>They\u2019re missing?!</em>\u201d Steve all but crawled out of his skin, but Mike\u2019s hands shot up, indicating to wait. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no. Don\u2019t freak,\u201d he said, letting his hands fall. \u201cWe saw them on the ferris wheel when we got out. We just decided to get food while we waited for them.\u201d Steve let out a huge sigh of relief. </p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Steve muttered. \u201cI can literally <em>feel</em> the gray hairs growing,\u201d Will and Mike shared a look at this. \u201cAnyway, fine. Just, <em>please</em> stick together. Move as a group, for my sake?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, Harrington,\u201d Eddie came up then, slinging his arm around Steve\u2019s shoulders. At first his whole body tensed up, but he quickly relaxed into the touch. It took some getting used to, but it wasn\u2019t unpleasant. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna drive yourself into an early grave.\u201d Eddie turned so he could smirk at Steve, leaving their faces all too close for Steve\u2019s comfort. So he turned back to face the kids. </p>\n<p>\u201cTell them to stop running around like little demons,\u201d Steve gestured to Mike and Will, who made faces of confusion and slight offense. </p>\n<p>Eddie placed his hand on his own chest, taking on a serious tone. \u201cI would <em>never</em> smother their passion,\u201d he turned to Mike and Will as well. \u201cGo. Cause problems,\u201d with this he pulled out a lighter and began handing it to them, but Steve\u2019s eyes widened and he snatched it away just in time. </p>\n<p>\u201cGive me that,\u201d he turned a scolding gaze on Eddie. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie just laughed, sliding his arm off of Steve\u2019s shoulders and instead grabbing him by the wrist, tugging him away. He called over his shoulder \u201cSee ya at eleven, boys!\u201d before forcing Steve to join the rest of the group. Eddie pushed on Steve\u2019s shoulders until he sat down before releasing and taking a seat next to him on the bench, stealing some fries out of his container in the process. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow are they?\u201d Jonathan asked as they sat down. </p>\n<p>\u201cAggravating, but fine,\u201d Steve supplied, finally starting on his fries. He noticed Eddie glancing over his shoulder, and followed his eyes to see he was watching Mike and Will, a curious expression on his face. \u201cWhatcha thinkin\u2019 about, Munson?\u201d Steve bumped his shoulder against Eddie\u2019s, drawing his attention back to the table. </p>\n<p>He seemed to hesitate a second, looking around the table before saying \u201cNah, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No, c\u2019mon,\u201d Steve said, disappointed. </p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 if it\u2019s about Will and Mike,\u201d Jonathan chimed in, Eddie looking at him with raised brows. \u201cYes.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAh, see I thought maybe so,\u201d Eddie nodded, and Steve looked between the two of them, clearly talking about something Steve did not get. \u201cMike talked about him nonstop in the Hellfire Club, so I always wondered.\" </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, \u2018cause I was wondering too,\u201d Vickie piped up, Steve\u2019s brows furrowing in further confusion. \u201cBut I\u2019m new, so I didn\u2019t know if it was like\u2013 an \u2018everyone knows\u2019 kind of thing,\u201d she gestured circularly to the group. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, trust me,\u201d Robin chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018everyone knows\u2019 kind of thing.\u201d Nancy nodded enthusiastically in agreement, and that was when Steve decided he needed to break his silence. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry\u2013\u201d he cut in, holding up a finger. \u201cEveryone knows what? Because I\u2019m lost.\u201d There was a momentary silence around the group as they all looked among each other, Steve looking between them in an effort to decipher what they were silently talking about. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat Will and Mike are into each other,\u201d Robin said, keeping her voice low and glancing in the boys\u2019 direction. It was at this moment that <em>everyone</em> at the table turned to observe the two boys, staring intently into each other\u2019s eyes as Mike talked animatedly about something, and Will watched on in abject adoration. Steve took note of how close they were sitting, and though he couldn\u2019t tell from his angle, it looked like they might\u2019ve even been holding hands. </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s jaw fell open. Had he really missed this? The entire time? Seeing it now, it made a <em>lot</em> of things make sense. Like, an absurd amount of things he thought were weird until this very moment. </p>\n<p>Then, the two boys turned their heads and made direct eye contact with the group. Immediately the six adults rotated to face their own table, all muttering out random, mix-matched excuses of a conversation in an attempt to cover their very obvious spying. A glance in the boys' direction showed looks of <em>deep</em> confusion on both of their faces as they got up and made their way towards the ferris wheel, stealing a few more confused glances over their shoulder. </p>\n<p>Eddie chuckling next to him got Steve\u2019s attention. He looked at Eddie curiously, raising his eyebrows. \u201cWhat are you giggling to yourself about?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just,\u201d Eddie chuckled once more, taking a sip of the soda he had gotten. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d When he spoke, it was almost more to himself. And while Steve didn\u2019t know what he meant by Eddie\u2019s words, Robin must have, because she laughed. </p>\n<p>Steve was about to ask what he meant, but Nancy ended up asking if the group was down for the haunted corn maze after they ate. Then the subject was changed, and despite Steve not being able to get the words out of his head, he didn\u2019t get a chance to bring it up again. </p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>The haunted corn maze was completely idiotic, Steve had decided. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d He proclaimed as he and Eddie continued their way through the corn stalk labyrinth. A cheaply painted, cartoon ghost on a wooden paddle had swung out of the corn maze, scaring Steve so hard he had screamed, bumping into Eddie and nearly toppling him. \u201cAnyone would have jumped, it popped out right in front of me!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t jump,\u201d Eddie countered, his laughter still not entirely exhausted as he watched Steve with clear amusement on his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou were further away,\u201d Steve said defensively. Eddie gave him a patronizing look. \u201cI\u2019ve fought literal monsters. You\u2019ve <em>seen me</em> fight literal monsters,\u201d he wasn\u2019t sure why he felt the need to keep defending himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie said simply, Steve giving him an intense look. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can handle myself,\u201d Steve kept going. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026 I believe that,\u201d Eddie replied in the same tone, and Steve couldn\u2019t even tell if he was still unconvinced. Steve gave him a long, scrutinizing look, but immediately jumped back as another wooden cutout sprung out from the stalks. </p>\n<p>\u201cSon of a\u2013\u201d Steve sucked in a long, loud breath through his nose, pursing his lips together. He could hear Eddie poorly trying to stifle a laugh behind his fist before he even turned to see it. Steve slowly turned his gaze to Eddie, ears still ringing from fear but fading. </p>\n<p>Eddie slowly lowered his fist, a poorly bitten back smile on his face as he said, voice strained and quiet in an attempt to hold back laughter: \u201cIt could happen to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve\u2019s voice came out higher than it usually was. \u201cAnyone,\u201d he repeated back before starting their walk again. He cleared his throat and said \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of this stupid maze and find the others. Where did they go, anyway? I swear I didn\u2019t even hear them turn different ways.\u201d Steve looked around, raising onto his tippy toes in a failed attempt to see over the corn stalks. </p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, Stevie,\u201d Eddie was leaning in close to Steve, his hand coming to rest where Steve\u2019s neck met his shoulders. Steve felt a chill shoot up his spine and carry down all the way to his fingertips. \u201cThis is supposed to be fun.\u201d Eddie\u2019s fingers and thumb began working at the tension in Steve\u2019s muscles, and he felt himself relax a bit. </p>\n<p>They got out of the maze not much later, much to Steve\u2019s relief, but saw no sign of their friends. \u201cWell, guess we\u2019re on our own, Munson,\u201d Steve said with a sigh as they moved through the carnival. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, try not to sound <em>too</em> excited,\u201d Eddie said sarcastically, filling Steve with fear he offended him, but when he saw that usual goofy smile he knew he was fine. \u201cSeriously, we still have,\u201d Eddie grabbed Steve\u2019s hand, the latter\u2019s face heating in the slightest, and checked his watch before dropping him. \u201cTwenty minutes \u2018til we have to take the ankle biters home. Wanna ride the ferris wheel?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve looked up at the ferris wheel beside them, then back to Eddie. \u201cWhy not?\u201d He gestured for Eddie to lead the way. The line wasn\u2019t long, and soon they were having a bar lowered over their lap, the ferris wheel starting its slow ascent. </p>\n<p>It was a nice night, a light breeze present but not so strong that it was unbearably cold. There were a decent amount of stars out as well, even with the light pollution of the carnival. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived kind of strange lives, huh Munson?\u201d Steve wondered aloud as they rose higher and higher above the ground. He could feel Eddie looking at him. He breathed a short laugh, turning to look at him as well. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not even twenty one yet.\u201d Steve leaned back, putting his arm across the back of the seat. He could just drop it around Eddie so easily\u2026 </p>\n<p>\u201cGuess we have. Maybe that means the rest is easy, though,\u201d Eddie offered, and Steve thought about this. He often found that he didn\u2019t know what to do with himself anymore. Obviously, he was grateful it was all over as he hardly found worrying for the lives of his loved ones enjoyable, but it did leave him feeling sort of\u2026 directionless. </p>\n<p>\u201cEver wonder if it\u2019ll be too easy?\u201d He looked over at Eddie and felt himself get lost in the sight. Big brown eyes lit up by the carnival lights, hair blowing in the light wind, cheeks and the tip of his nose tinged pink from cold. Steve almost wished he could paint so he could try and recreate it, but he didn\u2019t think even the best artist in the world could capture Eddie in his entirety. \u201cLike, if we did all that\u2026 what else is there to do?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie met Steve\u2019s eyes, and Eddie searched them as if they held the answer for him. \u201cNah. Life finds a way to fuck with you just when you start getting comfortable,\u201d he spoke the words with so much weight behind them, but Steve wasn\u2019t sure he knew all the meanings. Instead, he hummed in response, looking out across the horizon. They were at the peak of the first rotation now, the wheel stalled for viewing, and Steve looked out into the darkness of the wilderness that stretched out beyond the ferris wheel. He could see the tops of trees, and their cars in the parking lot. He even thought he spotted Max\u2019s bright red hair bobbing along next to Lucas from here. </p>\n<p>\u201cFeel like I have such a long way to comfortable,\u201d Steve said softly. He felt Eddie looking at him again, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look. Like Eddie\u2019s big, too-keen eyes would be too much and he\u2019d just\u2026 die on the spot. Or worse, be seen right through. The seat shifted a bit as Eddie moved just a fragment closer to Steve, his arm so close now but not nearly as close as Steve wanted. </p>\n<p> <em>Just do it, Steve. What\u2019s the big deal?</em> he thought to himself, and he had never become more aware of his limbs than in that moment. Their knees were so close, all Steve would have to do\u2013 </p>\n<p>As if Eddie read his mind, he widened his legs, pressing their knees together. They had just hit the bottom and were on their final rotation, but Steve felt like he was a kite floating up into the stratosphere. <em>Do it, Harrington. Who says it means anything?</em> he reasoned with himself. <em>You\u2019re physically affectionate with Robin all the time.</em> But this felt like a bigger deal than that. Frankly, he hadn\u2019t been this nervous since his first date with a girl freshman year. And that was the realization that made it click that he was being ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Eddie Munson was his friend, and if he wanted to put his arm around his friend\u2019s shoulder, then he fuckin\u2019 would, damn it.</p>\n<p>He sucked in a breath of courage and didn\u2019t release until he dropped his hand onto Eddie, wrapping his arm around his shoulders fully. Steve didn\u2019t dare look at the boy, keeping his gaze carefully trained ahead of them as Eddie studied him from the side. </p>\n<p>Whatever Eddie thought of Steve\u2019s action, he didn\u2019t share, and instead also turned his gaze to the view. He did, however, scoot a fraction even closer to Steve, his own arm snaking behind Steve\u2019s lower back and his hand on the seat, bracketing him that much closer. They were nearly at the peak again when Eddie let his head fall onto Steve\u2019s shoulder just a bit. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strange man, Steve Harrington,\u201d Eddie said softly, almost as if he was speaking to himself. A small smile twitched onto Steve\u2019s lips, the carriage halting at the top once more. </p>\n<p>Steve hummed in consideration before saying \u201cComing from you, Munson,\u201d he fiddled with a strand of Eddie\u2019s hair. \u201cThat is quite the proclamation.\u201d</p>\n<p>With his free hand he plucked the bat, Ozzy, from Eddie\u2019s hands and held it so it was looking at Eddie. In a high pitched, goofy voice that instantly made Eddie laugh, Steve made the bat say \u201cBecause you\u2019re veeeery straaange, Mr. Munson!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yes,\u201d Eddie said once his laughter died down, but not entirely. \u201cI got the implication, thank you.\u201d He kept laughing as he looked over at Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201cJuuust checking!\u201d Steve moved the bat\u2019s head dramatically, still holding the ridiculous voice. Steve didn\u2019t unwrap his arm from Eddie until their carriage stopped to let them out, the two of them walking shoulder to shoulder once they exited the ferris wheel. </p>\n<p>Steve held up his watch, and his eyes widened at the time. </p>\n<p> \u201cShit, we\u2019re ten minutes late to meet the kids!\u201d Without hesitation Steve grabbed Eddie\u2019s hand and began tugging him through the carnival, beelining for the parking lot. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington! Would you slow down, they\u2019re not gonna starve and wither away in ten minutes!\u201d Eddie called, but it was no use, Steve didn\u2019t stop yanking him through the crowd.</p>\n<p>When they reached the parking lot, Steve let out a sigh of relief to see everyone standing next to their cars.</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, look who decided to show up!\u201d Dustin scolded as Steve and Eddie reached the group, Steve finally releasing the other boy. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor someone who\u2019s always hounding us about not being where we\u2019re supposed to be, this is pretty rich, don\u2019t you think Harrington?\u201d Lucas teased, his arms crossed in a way that almost reminded Steve of himself. When Max started chuckling, he realized that was the point. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe ferris wheel took longer than we expected,\u201d Steve explained pointedly, rolling his eyes because of <em>course</em> the kids wouldn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to scold him. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds like a load of excuses to me, Steve,\u201d Mike said sternly, pitching his voice deeper and furrowing his brows. Nancy failed miserably to hide her laughter, whereas Robin didn\u2019t even try. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he gestured to Max, Lucas, and Dustin. \u201cIf you three don\u2019t wanna be walking behind the car the whole way home, I suggest you cut the lip and get in the car.\u201d The three of them rolled their eyes, but started saying their goodbyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cJonathan, Nancy. Good to see you guys,\u201d Steve nodded at them, turning his attention to Mike, Will, and El before saying \u201cYou too.\u201d His eyes couldn\u2019t help but linger between Mike and Will for a fraction of a second longer, his brain still processing what he\u2019d been told. Mike gave Steve a strange look, which snapped him back to reality as he hugged Vickie and Robin goodbye. He turned to Argyle, giving a sheepish wave. \"Nice meeting you, dude.\"</p>\n<p>Argyle gave a wide smile. \"Yeah, man, you too.\"</p>\n<p>Eddie looked almost conflicted about approaching Steve to say goodbye, so Steve took it upon himself to stride up and pull him into a hug. It took a beat before Eddie wrapped his arms around Steve\u2019s middle, squeezing tightly. </p>\n<p>\u201dYou should wear the vest more often, Stevie,\u201d Eddie murmured into Steve\u2019s ear, making his hair stand on end. They pulled apart, Eddie giving him a slow look up and down before giving a tug on Steve\u2019s vest lapels. He held agonizingly intense eye contact as he said \u201cI meant what I said about it.\u201d Steve felt stunned into silence, his mouth hanging slightly open as all he could do was just stare at Eddie, who was backing up to his van with an accomplished smile on his face.</p>\n<p>He held up the stuffed bat, moving it\u2019s head while in a garbly, high-pitched demon voice said \u201cThanks for winning me, Mr. Harrington.\u201d A smile stretched across Steve\u2019s face as he chuckled, shaking his head at Eddie\u2019s goofy behavior. Eddie smiled back, sending Steve a wink before finally disappearing to the driver\u2019s side of his van. Steve was frozen in place. </p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve Harrington!\u201d Dustin yelling snapped Steve back to reality, and from the annoyed look in his tone and on his face, he had tried more than once to get Steve\u2019s attention. He snapped his fingers in front of Steve\u2019s face and waved, Steve blinking and tucking his head back to create distance from the action. \u201cWanna take us home anytime soon?\u201d Dustin shook his head, turning away to follow Lucas and Max to the car. Quietly, Steve could hear him say \u201cI swear, first I deal with Will and Mike all night\u2026\u201d Whatever else was said was lost to the wind, Lucas merely sympathetically patting Dustin on the shoulder. </p>\n<p>When Steve pulled into the driveway of his house, all the kids dropped off, he turned off the car and let out a long sigh, head thumping against the headrest. He sat like that, in the dark silence of his car, for an hour before finally going inside. </p>\n<p>Steve stood in front of Eddie\u2019s door to his trailer, anxiously bouncing on his toes and running nervous hands through his hair. He looked around, as if surveying the environment for the nerve he needed to finally knock. He was trying to pretend like he didn\u2019t know why he was nervous, but that was beyond far from true. </p>\n<p>Eddie was around a little less the following week of the carnival, which meant Steve had a lot of uninterrupted hours at the Family Video Store to work out his\u2026 problem.</p>\n<p>Not that Steve thought being gay was a problem, but that\u2019s the thing. Was he gay? He genuinely liked Nancy\u2013 or at least, he thought so. But now he was starting to question everything he thought he knew about himself. Because if that felt <em>so real</em> in the moment, and <em>this</em> feels so real, how can he tell which one is true?</p>\n<p>If he liked Nancy, he was straight, and if he liked Eddie, he was gay. It was that simple in his mind. Now if he could just figure out which one it fuckin\u2019 was\u2026</p>\n<p>Which was why he was here in the first place. Eddie had offered to smoke with him for his first time, and he figured some one on one time with the boy would help him sort himself out. But that required actually <em>knocking on the fucking door.</em> He shook his head, forcing himself to get a grip. <em>This is stupid. Seriously, what have you become?</em></p>\n<p>Steve was about to finally knock when he heard\u2026 laughter? And not Eddie\u2019s. Were they not going to be alone? Curiosity outweighed his previous anxiety, and he finally gave a soft knock.</p>\n<p>The door opened to reveal a smiling Eddie, and behind him on the couch were none other than Argyle and Jonathan. Steve tried not to let his face fall. He didn\u2019t have any problems with the guys, but he had been anticipating he and Eddie being alone. Where Steve wouldn\u2019t feel the judgment of others, making him too scared to be a little more free around Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington,\u201d Eddie greeted. \u201cYou actually came. Figured I\u2019d invite Argyle and Jonathan, considering it\u2019s also their area of expertise,\u201d He smirked, giving a little bow to the two, Argyle returning it. </p>\n<p>Right, why would they have been alone? The only time Eddie hung out with him alone was at the carnival, and that\u2019s because they were forced to. Now that Steve thought about it, it was probably weird to assume Eddie <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> invite them. He silently thanked Steve-From-The-Past for deciding against wearing the damn vest again. It had been a heavy debate, one that almost made him late. </p>\n<p>\u201cI brought beer,\u201d Steve held up the case he had grabbed from his house. \u201cYa know, as thanks.\u201d He was initially going to only bring a six pack, but then he remembered how much he and Robin drank of Eddie\u2019s the last time they were over, and felt bad not giving him more. But, considering the newly added guests, it worked out moreso. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a gentleman,\u201d Eddie mused, clapping Steve on the back and lightly ushering him into the trailer. \u201cThough, maybe don\u2019t drink if it\u2019s gonna be your first time smoking,\u201d Eddie offered, closing the door before taking the case from Steve and putting it in his fridge. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is your <em>first time</em> smoking?\u201d Jonathan asked, clearly surprised. \u201cBut you\u2019re\u2026 Steve Harrington. I would\u2019ve thought at some point\u2026\u201d Jonathan ended his sentence with a shrug. </p>\n<p>\u201cNah, both my coaches drilled into us the importance of lung health,\u201d Steve said, pulling a face as he did so. \u201cApparently your liver\u2019s not important, though. Stuck to drinking for high school,\u201d Steve joked, taking a seat next to Jonathan. Argyle, despite there being room on the couch, chose to move to the floor. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, tell your lungs to lube up, Stevie,\u201d Eddie had disappeared into his room, but emerged now with a clear bong and a plastic baggie of weed, grinning as he held the two items up. \u201cBecause they\u2019re about to lose their virginity.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve grimaced while Argyle laughed. \u201cWe made a deal that you wouldn\u2019t call it that again,\u201d he pointed an accusing finger at Eddie as he leaned back against the couch. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now I won\u2019t,\u201d Eddie said simply as he sat down next to Steve on the couch, Jonathan scooting over to leave more room. \u201cGot it out of my system.\u201d Eddie set the bong and baggie of weed on the table, instead picking up a small, circular object from it. He opened it and placed the two halves on either of his knees, revealing jagged points inside. Eddie began placing broken up pieces of weed in between the spikes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat looks like a torture device for very tiny people,\u201d Steve commented as Eddie closed the halves and began twisting them in opposing directions. </p>\n<p>Eddie gave a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a grinder,\u201d he informed, giving it a few more twists. Steve couldn\u2019t help but watch the way his arms flexed in his t-shirt as he did so. He opened a third compartment that Steve didn\u2019t know the object contained, and there was a bunch of grinded bits of weed that almost looked like moss. It smelled\u2026 somehow like sweet coffee, but\u2026 grimier? He knew it smelled like a skunk when it was burned, but he learned it didn\u2019t have an off putting aroma beforehand. </p>\n<p>\u201cMakes it smoke easier, and you don\u2019t waste as much,\u201d Eddie continued to educate as he took small pinches of the plant and tucked it into the bowl of the bong. He dug a lighter out of his pocket, closing the grinder and placing it on the table. He turned to Steve, holding the bong and lighter before giving a thoughtful look. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t know how to use this?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Steve supplied, popping the \u2018p.\u2019 </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s easy. I\u2019m not gonna do it first because I want you to get the green, but you just put your mouth in like this,\u201d Eddie paused to demonstrate before pulling back out. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna suck in while you burn the weed here,\u201d he moved the unlit lighter over the bowl, though Steve didn\u2019t really need a visual to understand that part. \u201cAnd once this whole area gets white with smoke,\u201d Eddie ran long fingers over the tube part of the bong, Steve\u2019s birthday present winking back at him. He felt his stomach tighten. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna pull this out, like so,\u201d Eddie pulled the bowl piece out. \u201cAnd suck in <em>again,</em> but like a little bit harder.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d Steve asked sarcastically, feeling like that was a lot of steps to remember. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot really, actually,\u201d Jonathan chimed in, gaining Steve\u2019s attention. \u201cWhen you suck it into your mouth basically, that\u2019s not inhaling it into your lungs. So you have to inhale <em>again</em> and then hold your breath for as long as you can before exhaling.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, before coughing,\u201d Eddie corrected. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely gonna cough your first time. It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of verbal instructions you just gave me, and I\u2019m gonna be honest I\u2019ve already forgotten some,\u201d Steve said blankly, earning a chuckle from Eddie. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just focus that pretty little head of yours on sucking,\u201d Eddie pushed the bong into Steve\u2019s hands, the latter hoping the lighting was dim enough in the trailer to hide his blush. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do the hard parts,\u201d he held up a lighter, readying it over the bowl. </p>\n<p>Steve gave him a final look of hesitation before putting his mouth to the piece, and following Eddie\u2019s instructions. The bong began to bubble as Eddie lit the bowl, milky white filling the entire piece faster than Steve had expected. Eddie pulled the bowl out and Steve felt the tension inside snap as he quickly sucked in all the smoke he could, Jonathan taking the bong from him and clearing it as Steve did his best to inhale again.</p>\n<p>Steve held his breath, face scrunching in effort as he looked at Eddie, who watched him intently. He held it one, two, three whole seconds before a plume of smoke erupted out of him, accompanied by a coughing fit. </p>\n<p>Jonathan gave him sympathetic pats on the back as Eddie got up and, though Steve could only tell from the sound of running water as his eyes were currently squeezed tight, filled up a cup of water. The glass was being pushed into his hand and he quickly gulped it back, his cough having subsided to something much smaller by the time he was done. </p>\n<p>\u201cJesus fucking christ,\u201d Steve croaked out, accompanied by a few more coughs that he washed back with more water. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Eddie asked. </p>\n<p>Steve lowered his glass before rasping out, \u201cCherry definitely popped.\u201d Argyle laughed at this, Eddie grinning. \u201cThis what being high is?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou tell me, Harrington,\u201d Eddie chuckled. \u201cSome people don\u2019t even feel it their first time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s eyes bulged at this. \u201cYou mean I could\u2019ve just done all of that for nothing?\u201d Eddie and Jonathan chuckled at this, the bong bubbling from its place in Argyle\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe. Take a second,\u201d Eddie coaxed, slinging his arm around Steve\u2019s shoulders. Steve felt chills erupt across his skin, his stomach floaty like the anxiety one has as a roller coaster slowly climbs upwards. \u201cFeel any different?\u201d </p>\n<p>This was hard to do, because he was pretty sure the only thing he felt was Eddie\u2019s arm around him, and big eyes staring intently at his face. He forced himself to look forward, letting out a deep breath. The light inside the van was dim, the curtains drawn, save for a few streaks of afternoon sunlight filtering through. Steve watched the dust particles dance in the glow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel\u2026\u201d Steve searched for the right word. \u201cFuzzy.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jonathan and Eddie chuckled at this. \u201cSounds about right,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cBut that\u2019s only really the beginning.\u201d The bong was passed around to Eddie, who, to Steve\u2019s dismay, had to unwind his arm to accept it. Steve watched, a bit fascinated, as Eddie lit his bowl and took his own hit, barely coughing as he finished. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou were more graceful than I was,\u201d Steve commented, narrowing his eyes as if Eddie did it on purpose. Eddie gave a small laugh. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there Harrington,\u201d he assured, packing another bowl before passing the bong to Steve. \u201cWanna do it yourself?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Steve said, unsure of himself as he took the lighter and bong from Eddie.</p>\n<p>Seeming to sense Steve\u2019s hesitation, Eddie reminded him of the steps. \u201cPull,\u201d he tapped the top of the bong, then the lighter. \u201cLight,\u201d his finger then trailed up the tube once more, \u201cMilk,\u201d he tapped the bowl. \u201cRemove, then you clear the bong and it\u2019s the double inhale.\u201d Steve nodded, getting it when it was more straight to the point. </p>\n<p>And surprisingly, it wasn\u2019t a total disaster. He still coughed a lot, but he was able to do it himself. After he passed the bong to Jonathan he collapsed back into the couch\u2013 or rather, Eddie\u2019s arm again\u2013 a few coughs working their way out of his system. </p>\n<p>Steve just took in the room, a smile permanently plastered to his face as he looked at nothing in particular. \u201cYa did it, Stevie,\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice close to his ear brought him back from wherever he had floated off to. He turned to face him, his eyes feeling heavy as he took in Eddie\u2019s face. And then he <em>giggled,</em> for the love of god. Yup. He was definitely high now. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Eddie questioned, a lopsided smile on his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have\u2026 no idea,\u201d Steve said honestly before a mostly silent laugh wracked his body, Eddie also laughing. Whether Eddie was laughing at Steve\u2019s ridiculousness or something also unknown to him, Steve didn\u2019t know, but he didn\u2019t particularly care. He did care, however, when Eddie had to once again remove his arm in order to take another hit. </p>\n<p>When Eddie passed the bong to him this time, Steve just passed it along to Jonathan. \u201cThink I\u2019m\u2026 already there,\u201d He informed Eddie who nodded, and put his arm across the back of the couch once more. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d and then Eddie was ruffling Steve\u2019s hair and Steve felt like he might melt into the couch right then and there, his head tipping back into the touch subconsciously. \u201cYou know your limits.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you have <em>The Shining</em>?\u201d Argyle held up a movie from Eddie\u2019s collection. \u201cThis movie rules. Can we watch it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cArgyle, dude. You\u2019ve seen that movie like a million times,\u201d Jonathan chuckled. \u201cEddie\u2019s got a fuck ton of horror movies, you really wanna watch one you\u2019ve seen so many times?\u201d </p>\n<p>Argyle seemed to think about this for a second. \u201cIf I already know I like it, why wouldn\u2019t I enjoy watching it?\u201d Jonathan opened his mouth to answer, but stopped, seeming to think harder about Argyle\u2019s response. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Jonathan conceded. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019d\u2019ya say, Harrington?\u201d Eddie looked at him, smirking. \u201cOr are you still reliving your time in the haunted corn maze?\u201d Normally, Steve would\u2019ve rolled his eyes or grumbled out how he wasn\u2019t that scared, but Eddie\u2019s hand was still in his hair, massaging slow movements into the back of his head, and frankly Steve couldn\u2019t find it in him to even pretend to be bothered. </p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Never seen it,\u201d he shrugged, tilting his head back further into Eddie\u2019s touch, not even fully aware of his own eyes falling shut. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen <em>The Shining</em>?\u201d Jonathan asked in disbelief. Steve shrugged again. \u201cDidn\u2019t see it when it came out, and got a little busy when monsters from another dimension started invading Hawkins.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Jonathan chuckled as Argyle began to put in the movie. Eddie\u2019s hand fell from Steve\u2019s hair, falling instead over his shoulder. Steve tried not to let his disappointment show.</p>\n<p>It was roughly thirty minutes into the movie, and Steve\u2019s mind would not focus on it for the life of him. He was frankly less than impressed so far, considering how highly spoken of the movie was. In its defense, though, not much was scary to Steve after spending his teen years fighting demogorgons, and the Mind Flayer\u2026 and whatever the hell Vecna was. </p>\n<p>Instead, he found his mind was only able to focus on Eddie. His wide eyes reflected the oddities on the screen, bottom lip ever so slightly bit. His arm was still around Steve, and maybe if he\u2019d have been sober he would\u2019ve cared about what Jonathan or Argyle thought, but as it were he couldn\u2019t find it in him to worry. And if either of them thought anything weird, neither said something or indicated otherwise. Steve imagined they were also too high to think anything of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch the movie, Stevie,\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice was a low purr, probably soft enough the other boys didn\u2019t hear. Steve wasn\u2019t sure when Eddie had started looking at him instead of the screen, a coy smile on his face. </p>\n<p>Steve made a disinterested face. \u201cWhen does it get scary?\u201d He let his attention fall begrudgingly back onto the screen, very aware of Eddie still looking at the side of his face. </p>\n<p>He felt two gentle tugs on the hair at the nape of his neck, and Steve almost exploded out of his seat due to the excitement that burst through him. \u201cImpatient,\u201d Eddie cooed. \u201cIt\u2019s not in-your-face scary, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve made a confused face. \u201cThen what kind of scary is it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be\u2026 unsettling.\u201d Eddie explained. \u201cIf you put yourself in Wendy\u2019s shoes, it\u2019s a terrifying situation.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cPlus, you\u2019re tellin\u2019 me that kid and his freaky little imaginary friend doesn\u2019t skeeve you out?\u201d Argyle chimed in, their efforts of trying to remain quiet apparently having failed. </p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I guess\u2026 but we know a fifteen year old who can literally kill people in the blink of an eye,\u201d Steve countered, shrugging. Jonathan nodded, as if to concede to Steve. </p>\n<p>The movie continued, but Steve was so hyper aware of all the points of contact with Eddie he still couldn\u2019t focus. The side of Eddie\u2019s thigh pressed against Steve\u2019s, his thumb tracing slow patterns on his shoulder, his other shoulder tucked into Eddie\u2019s side. It was so much, but somehow not enough. He let his head fall onto Eddie\u2019s shoulder, noting the other boy stiffen for a moment, his thumb pausing its movements for just a second. Steve felt something akin to pride flutter through him. </p>\n<p>Eddie gave a squeeze to Steve\u2019s shoulder before continuing his tracing, his fingertips stretching their reach so he lightly strummed up and down Steve\u2019s bicep in slow, languid movements. </p>\n<p>Argyle got up, pulling a bag of popcorn out of a backpack next to him and making his way to the kitchenette. \u201cHey, man. Can I use your microwave?\u201d Argyle asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d Eddie called over, not pausing his movements on Steve, who felt like his brain was nothing but pure static at this point. </p>\n<p>When Argyle was on his way back to the seat on the floor, he paused for a moment, looking at Eddie and Steve with a thoughtful look on his face. Steve felt his entire body tense. <em>Was he gonna say something?</em></p>\n<p>Argyle looked at Jonathan then, sheer disappointment on his face. \u201cMan, why don\u2019t you ever hold me like that?\u201d He gestured to Eddie and Steve, confusion replacing all the fear he had felt moments before. Jonathan glanced over at the two, then back at Argyle, also confused. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 never asked me to?\u201d It was more of a question than an answer. Argyle sucked his teeth in disapproval, shaking his head as he took his seat on the floor again, digging through his popcorn bag. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s cool. You just don\u2019t value our friendship enough to show your affection through physical touch,\u201d Argyle brushed him off. \u201cI get it.\u201d </p>\n<p>There was a silence, Jonathan looking to Eddie and Steve for an answer, but they just shook their heads. \u201cArgyle?\u201d Jonathan asked timidly. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you\u2026 Want me to hold you sometimes?\u201d Jonathan still looked extremely confused by his friend\u2019s apparently neglected needs. </p>\n<p>Argyle looked up, that thoughtful expression returned as he seemed to really consider his answer. Finally, he looked at Jonathan and said \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d And went back to eating his popcorn, eyes on the screen.\n</p>\n<p>Jonathan looked at Steve and Eddie again, who just shrugged in tandem. Jonathan turned back to Argyle. \u201cArgyle?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Argyle looked back at his friend. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to hold you <em>now,</em> or\u2026?\u201d Argyle thought about Jonathan\u2019s question again, pausing his eating as he did so. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Maybe later,\u201d he smiled before returning to the movie and his popcorn. Honestly, Steve kinda admired his direct communication. Lord knew he could certainly take a page out of his book. </p>\n<p>At some point Eddie\u2019s hand slowed to a stop. And then his arm was smoothly maneuvered to wrap around Steve\u2019s lower back. And now his hand was on Steve\u2019s waist, his thumb making slow strokes over the shirt there. Steve\u2019s heart was in his throat, and he could feel his stomach floating away from him. He was pretty sure if Eddie\u2019s arm wasn\u2019t anchoring him down, he\u2019d be hitting the ceiling. </p>\n<p>To give some indication that, <em>yes, he wanted this,</em> he angled his body so he was leaning more on Eddie, sinking down in his seat slightly so he could rest his head more comfortably on Eddie\u2019s chest. </p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t get his mind off the hand on his side for the rest of the movie, every little movement of Eddie\u2019s fingers sending trills up his spine. As the credits rolled, Jonathan stretched beside Steve, standing up. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe should probably head out. Gotta pick up Will from Mike\u2019s,\u201d Jonathan explained, Argyle getting up and slinging his backpack over one shoulder. This, to Steve\u2019s dismay, prompted Eddie to stand up to say goodbye. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood seein\u2019 ya, Byers,\u201d Eddie gave Jonathan a hug before turning and doing the same to Argyle. \u201cPleasure getting acquainted,\u201d he said in a posh British accent. </p>\n<p>\u201cTotally, man,\u201d Argyle smiled as he and Jonathan shuffled out the door, giving their final waves. Eddie closed the door and turned back to face Steve, who was trying to rub the sleep out of his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI should probably get going, too, but honestly I\u2019m not good to drive yet,\u201d Steve blinked a few times as he pulled his hands away from his eyes. \u201cIs it cool if I stay here for like, an hour or something?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, whatever you need, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said with a wave, picking up his paraphernalia and disappearing for a second. He grabbed a beer from the fridge on the way back, cracking it open as he took a seat next to Steve. \u201cSo. What were your thoughts on the movie?\u201d Eddie asked, raising the can to his lips. He and Steve weren\u2019t pressed right against each other, but rather facing one another, knees turned toward the other as each of their arms propped them up against the back of the couch. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt was\u2026 alright. Had some cool shots, I guess,\u201d He said as he tried to recall the movie. </p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, you didn\u2019t really seem to be paying much attention,\u201d Eddie said with a smirk, and Steve felt his face heat. He did the only thing he knew how to do when Eddie got to him in such a way; rolled his eyes. But he was biting back a smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cBeing high is distracting,\u201d Steve supplied the weak defense knowing neither of them really believed it. They debated certain parts of the movie for a little while, and admittedly Steve realized he retained less than he thought. Then, Eddie changed the subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Byers seem to get along well, considering you used to date his girlfriend,\u201d Eddie commented, taking a sip of his beer. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well. We didn\u2019t always,\u201d Steve shrugged. \u201cMostly my fault. Though, in my defense, he kinda acted like a creep.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t anymore?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t anymore,\u201d Steve confirmed, Eddie nodding with a smile. It all sort of hit Steve then that they were alone, and if there was any time to try something that could be embarrassing, it\u2019d be right now. His eyes fell on one of Eddie\u2019s knees. It would be so easy to make some charming joke and reach his hand over\u2026 he\u2019d done it a million times with girls. It was a hit! So why can\u2019t he just get his arm to move?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wear the vest,\u201d Eddie said with a pout, ripping him out of his internal struggle. Steve blinked, realizing he didn\u2019t quite process what Eddie had said. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s mischievous smirk deepened a little. \u201cThe vest,\u201d he reached out and gave the collar of Steve\u2019s polo shirt a quick tug, before letting his hand fall on Steve\u2019s knee. </p>\n<p><em>Rat bastard,</em> Steve thought, his face heating. <em>He beat me to it.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wear it,\u201d he repeated, cocking his head and sticking his bottom lip out briefly before devolving back into that signature smile. </p>\n<p>Steve felt himself lean a little closer, moving Eddie\u2019s hand up his leg just a <em>fraction</em> but it felt like miles to Steve. \u201cNo, uh,\u201d he dipped his head for a second, trying to get a miniscule break from Eddie\u2019s all-seeing gaze. \u201cI was going to, but then, uh. Thought better not, \u2018cause of the smell,\u201d he gestured to the atmosphere around them, which held no visible smoke, but likely smelled heavy to whoever would walk in. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize it was <em>my</em> vest before, right?\u201d Eddie chuckled. \u201cProbably already smells like weed, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve shook his head with a shrug. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d and then his face stalled, eyes widening slightly and cheeks heating at his words. \u201cI-I mean\u2026 not that I\u2019ve noticed, at least.\u201d He gave an only slightly nervous sniff. <em>Nice save, Harrington,</em> he internally praised himself. </p>\n<p>Eddie was staring at him, observing him, not saying a word. Just the hint of a fond smile on his face as he looked at Steve. It made Steve crinkle a bit under the scrutiny, but it also made him want to be bold.</p>\n<p>He nudged the knee Eddie had his hand on closer, pressing it into the inside of Eddie\u2019s knee as he sat a little more forward, eyes focusing nervously on one of Eddie\u2019s necklaces. He took in a deep breath, and on the exhale said \u201cEddie, I\u2013\u201d </p>\n<p>But he was cut off by a rapid pounding on the door. They both jumped at this, turning to face the door. A moment of silence before the rapping was back. Eddie looked back at Steve, clear annoyance at the interruption written on his face. Another round of knocking came and he pushed himself up with an exasperated sigh. </p>\n<p>\u201cMildred, for the last time I\u2019m not feeding your cat tomatoes!\u201d Eddie called as he yanked open his door, but instead of whoever Mildred was, there was Mike Wheeler, breathing heavy with his bike discarded behind him. Steve\u2019s brows furrowed. </p>\n<p>\u201cWheeler, now\u2019s not the best time to talk campaigns\u2013\u201d Eddie pressed, but Mike cut him off. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about D&amp;D, Eddie!\u201d Mike said frantically, eyes wide with fear. Steve stood up, anxiety flooding him. <em>No\u2026 please don\u2019t be back,</em> he pleaded silently. It couldn\u2019t be back. He just got\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cOut with it Wheeler! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eddie snapped his fingers a few times. </p>\n<p>\u201cI kissed Will!\u201d Mike\u2019s voice cracked as he said this, eyes growing watery as silence fell around them. Eddie looked back over to Steve with his mouth in the form of an \u2018o\u2019, and Steve just stared wide-eyed back. This was when Mike seemed to notice Steve\u2019s presence. His eyes widened and cheeks turned bright red. \u201cSteve? W-what are you doing here?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe were, uh\u2026\u201d Steve glanced at Eddie, then back to Mike. \u201cJust hangin\u2019 out. But back to your thing\u2013\u201d Mike furrowed his brows, sniffing the air a few times. </p>\n<p>\u201cSmells like weed,\u201d Mike commented, looking at Steve with raised eyebrows. \u201cSteve, you smoke weed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said at the same time Eddie said \u201cNow he does!\u201d Steve shot him a glare, Eddie shrugging defensively.</p>\n<p>Eddie sighed, looking at Mike and likely realizing he and Steve would be douchebags to turn him away right now. \u201cInside, Wheeler,\u201d Eddie stepped aside, allowing Mike in before closing the door. Mike took a seat on the couch, Eddie and Steve following suit. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you kissed Will. That\u2019s a catastrophe because\u2026?\u201d Eddie gestured for Mike to explain. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s my best friend and now he probably hates me,\u201d Mike said as if it were obvious. Mike\u2019s face fell a little bit before he added, more quietly \u201cAnd\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I was gay.\u201d The smallness in Mike\u2019s voice made something inside Steve break. He sounded so\u2026 lost.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Let\u2019s address that first part first, shall we?\u201d Eddie held up a finger. \u201cHow did he react when you kissed him? Did he kiss you back?\u201d </p>\n<p>Mike seemed to think back before saying \u201cWell\u2026 yeah.\u201d Eddie let out a sigh, shaking his head slightly. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen <em>why</em> would you think he hates you now?\u201d Eddie asked. </p>\n<p>Mike looked caught off guard by that question, but shook his head in a rush to explain. \u201cBecause we got interrupted. Will took too long leaving so Jonathan came pounding on the basement door. Will sort of just looked at me all bug-eyed before grabbing his things and leaving with Jonathan. We didn\u2019t get to\u2026 talk about it at all. And he looked scared leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ya think he\u2019s just scared for the same reasons you are?\u201d Steve supplied, his arms crossed as he watched the high-strung mess that was Mike. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington\u2019s right, Wheeler,\u201d Eddie agreed. \u201cHe probably just got all twitchy \u2018cause his brother showed up, and he probably left in a panic thinking you hated him too.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mike furrowed his brows again. \u201cWhy would I hate him? I kissed him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie rolled his eyes dramatically. \u201cAnd he kissed you back, yet here you are whining to us because you think he hates you.\u201d Eddie threw up his hands in defeat, shaking his head as he looked over at Steve. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he gestured in disbelief to their troubled younger friend. Steve shrugged to show he sympathized. </p>\n<p>Eddie turned back to Mike, speaking softer than Steve had ever really heard him speak to the kids. \u201cBut we should get to that second part\u2026 Do you still not think you\u2019re gay?\u201d </p>\n<p>Mike covered his face in his hands as he flopped back on the couch, letting out a muffled groan. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so confusing,\u201d he took his hands away from his face, talking more to the ceiling than Eddie or Steve. \u201cI really liked El, ya know? We dated and I didn\u2019t feel like I was faking it but\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m faking it with Will. And if I\u2019m not\u2026 I was basically just leading El on the entire time.\u201d And in that moment, Steve realized he had never related more to Mike Wheeler. He wanted to jump up and yell <em>\u201dYes! Exactly!\u201d</em> but somehow managed to contain himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Mikey,\u201d Eddie sighed. \u201cThings aren\u2019t always so black and white.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mike pulled another confused face. \u201cWhat do you mean? You don\u2019t think kissing Will means I\u2019m gay?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie let out a hardy snort at this. \u201cNo, I definitely think it means you like guys.\u201d This earned an exasperated gesture from Mike, clearly not finding Eddie\u2019s words helpful. \u201cYou don\u2019t just kiss your long-term childhood best friend because you\u2019re <em>not</em> into him, what I\u2019m saying is it doesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t into El.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The question came from both Steve and Mike. Eddie looked over at Steve, brows knitted tightly together as his eyes narrowed. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you not\u2013\u201d Eddie shook his head, holding up a single finger to Steve. \u201cPay attention,\u201d he swiveled back to Mike and gave a sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s more than just being \u2018gay\u2019 or \u2018straight,\u2019 Mike\u2026\u201d He glanced at Steve. \u201cAnd audience. You can like guys and girls, it\u2019s called being bisexual.\u201d <em>Bisexual.</em> The word echoed around Steve\u2019s brain, and it was as if something unknown clicked into place. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a thing?\u201d Mike asked, taking the words right out of Steve\u2019s mouth. </p>\n<p>Eddie chuckled. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a thing. So you can stop worrying about being some sort of imposter, and start thinking about what you need to talk to Will about. But Mike,\u201d Eddie added when he saw stress wash over Mike\u2019s face at that advice. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate you. Trust me. There\u2019s no use making up how he feels about you in your head, positive or negative.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mike nodded slowly, staring off somewhere distant. Steve felt like he was in the same place, but realized he should probably get the kid off the streets while he\u2019s having a crisis. With a sigh, Steve stood up. \u201cC\u2019mon, Wheeler. Put your bike in my trunk and I\u2019ll take you home,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good to drive?\u201d Eddie double checked. </p>\n<p>Steve breathed a short laugh. \u201cYeah, that was, uh\u2026 a sobering experience.\u201d This earned a harder laugh from Eddie than Steve had expected, but he just gave him a weird look as he followed Mike to the door. </p>\n<p>As Mike grabbed his bike off the lawn and walked it over to Steve\u2019s car, Steve stopped in the doorway and turned to Eddie. He kept his voice low when he spoke, \u201cYou, uh, handled that really well. I think you actually helped the kid.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well\u2026 Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve also been the\u2026\u201d Eddie shook his head as he looked for the right phrasing. \u201cGay idiot who kissed their best friend. Only\u2026 he didn\u2019t kiss me back.\u201d Eddie gave a halfhearted smile as he tapped his right cheekbone. \u201cGave me a right hook instead. So\u2026 I\u2019m pretty knowledgeable on the subject.\u201d </p>\n<p>It was one of the most heartbreaking things Steve had ever heard. To do that to anybody he couldn\u2019t imagine, but especially to do it to someone as sweet as Eddie\u2026 It was too cruel for words. So instead Steve wrapped his arms around Eddie\u2019s shoulders, pulling him into a crushing hug. Eddie seemed taken off guard by this, as it took a second or two for him to wrap his arms around Steve\u2019s middle. </p>\n<p>He knew he held the hug for too long, but he didn\u2019t care. He was wrapped up in Eddie\u2019s vanilla (and weed) smelling hair, burying his face into the crook of his neck and clutching his back tight enough to just barely bunch up the fabric there. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re good to drive, Harrington?\u201d Eddie chuckled into his ear, the sound rumbling against Steve\u2019s chest. Steve breathed a laugh of his own, pulling back and finally letting go of Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Steve said with a sigh as he backed down the steps to Eddie\u2019s trailer. Steve could see Eddie watching them drive off in his rearview mirror, a faint smile rising to his lips at the sight. </p>\n<p>There was a small silence, neither he nor Mike speaking, until the younger finally broke it. \u201cSo\u2026 You and Eddie hang out a lot one on one, or\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSay, Wheeler,\u201d Steve cut him off. \u201cDid you or did you not use tongue when you kissed Will?\u201d This earned him a punch in the arm from Mike, but it got the younger boy to shut up. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s like\u2013\u201d Steve scoffed, swinging his feet from where he sat on the checkout counter, Robin sweeping around underneath him. It was a slow day at the Family Video Store, and Steve was taking full advantage of it to rant to Robin about his predicament. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that was a <em>thing</em>! Did you know it was a thing?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, bisexuality?\u201d Robin glanced up at Steve with a chuckle. \u201cYeah, Steve. Vickie\u2019s bi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, thanks for tellin\u2019 me! Jeez\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t think you were <em>that</em> in the dark,\u201d Robin defended. \u201cI would\u2019ve told you what it was sooner. I thought you were just\u2026 oblivious to yourself.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCould\u2019ve told me that, too,\u201d Steve said with raised eyebrows. \u201cSee somethin\u2019, say somethin\u2019, Robbie.\u201d </p>\n<p>Robin laughed at this. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 first of all, about bullying. Second of all, think it could\u2019ve been considered bullying if I was constantly pointing out every time you did something gay.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWas it that often?\u201d Steve asked, brows knitted together. </p>\n<p>Robin made a show of rolling her eyes. \u201c<em>Painfully</em> often.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve felt heat rise to his face at this, his eyes falling to his lap to avoid looking at her. He thought he had managed to keep this mostly to himself, and that Robin just enjoyed teasing him. But when he burst through the back room at the start of his shift, frantically crying out \u201cI think I\u2019m bisexual,\u201d Robin had barely glanced up from her magazine, simply saying \u201cFinally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2013 it\u2019s not fair, Rob,\u201d Steve started again, ignoring the amused look on her face. \u201cIf I like guys, I should be able to flirt like I do with girls. But then I\u2019m in the moment and I just\u2013 freeze up\u2013 I <em>don\u2019t</em> freeze up, Robin.\u201d He looked at her with a severe expression in his eyes. </p>\n<p>Robin chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ve said it a million times, and I\u2019ll say it again; welcome to what it\u2019s like being everyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve groaned. \u201cI hate being like everyone else. I like being me! Steve Good-At-Flirting Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYa know, I\u2019m actually glad this is happening. You were in desperate need of an ego check,\u201d Robin teased, Steve rolling his eyes in response. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow do other people deal with being all\u2026\u201d Steve flapped his hand absently in the air. \u201cSqueamish and squirmy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when Vickie makes me feel like that now, I just kiss her,\u201d Robin shrugs. \u201cBefore I could freely do that, I kinda just felt like I was dying whenever I was around her. But ya know, in a good way.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely unhelpful, thank you,\u201d Steve said as the phone next to him rang. She stuck her tongue out at him before starting to sweep the rest of the store, Steve picking up. \u201cFamily Video Store, this is Steve.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cStevie,\u201d Steve straightened at the familiar voice, a tingling sensation spreading in the pit of his stomach. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey Munson,\u201d this earned Robin\u2019s attention. She started making kissy faces at Steve, who glared at her and gave her a wave to tell her to get lost. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing this Saturday?\u201d Eddie asked through the phone. It was rare for him to call instead of showing up to ask whatever he wanted in person. Steve tried not to get disappointed over this. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot working, for once,\u201d Steve inspected a candy bar next to him in an attempt to calm his fluttery nerves. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCome to my show,\u201d Eddie said, and Steve could practically hear the signature smile etched into his face. His stomach did a flip. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to come see your band?\u201d Steve repeated for clarity, but also so Robin could hear. A look in her direction showed her grinning and giving Steve an aggressive thumbs up. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we play at a restaurant in town sometimes. Not a lot of people show up, but it\u2019d be cool if you did,\u201d Steve felt the need to punch the air, but restrained himself, instead crossing his arms and clearing his throat. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, yeah, sounds fun,\u201d Steve smiled to himself widely. </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat! Pass the word onto Robin and Vickie, if you want,\u201d Eddie said before giving Steve the address and start-time. A part of Steve just wanted to go by himself, but then he thought he should probably bring as many people as he could think of to show out. Which, admittedly, was only Nancy, Jonathan, and Argyle in addition to Robin and Vickie, but he figured it was better than nothing. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, Munson. Me and the rest of the groupies will be there,\u201d Steve teased, Eddie chuckling on the other end. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou gonna throw your bra on stage, Harrington?\u201d He hated how the question made him light in the stomach and red in the face. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that depends how good you play, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He countered, biting his lip in a failed attempt to stop the smile threatening to split his face in half.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose are high stakes, Stevie,\u201d Eddie tutted through the phone. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go whip the boys into shape. Every time they mess up they\u2019ll get the hose.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve barked a laugh, earning a raised eyebrow from Robin. \u201cThe hose?\u201d He asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I mean it\u2019s not high pressure or anything. It\u2019s just the garden hose,\u201d Eddie supplied, before adding \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty cold!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll leave you to it, then,\u201d Steve chuckled. \u201cBye, Munson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee ya Saturday, Stevie,\u201d Eddie said before the line went dead. Steve hung up the phone, smiling to himself quietly. He looked up to see Robin smiling at him. She waggled her eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>It was a fairly warm night, likely one of the last few as they moved through August. But even if the breeze were stronger, Steve was pretty sure his nerves would keep him perfectly warm. He was practically bouncing in line to the bar Eddie was playing at, The Hideout, his friends chatting amongst themselves while he worried about how he looked. </p>\n<p>He bent down so he could check his hair in the window of a car parked next to where they waited, running his fingers through it, not satisfied with his abilities. Steve stood back up, straightening the vest as he did so. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou look fine, Steve,\u201d Robin gave him a small shove back into line. \u201cStop stressing.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re too close. Of course you would say I look fine,\u201d Steve turned to Vickie, who came up to hook her arm in Robin\u2019s. \u201cVickie, be honest,\u201d he pointed up at his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as usual, right? Too,\u201d he gestured around his head vaguely. \u201cMuch?\u201d </p>\n<p>Vickie furrowed her brows, tilting her head a bit as she scrutinized him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s what it normally looks like.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s good, right?\u201d He clarified. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, you are frequently referred to as \u2018Steve \u2018the Hair\u2019 Harrington,\u2019\u201d Robin cut in flatly. \u201cClearly whatever you got goin\u2019 on is working for you.\u201d </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t long before Steve was giving his ID to the bouncer, getting a big \u2018X\u2019 on the back of his hand. The bar was small, but it was surprisingly decently filled. There were some tables pushed to the back, leaving a bit of open space in front of the small stage, only elevated a step or two, on the farthest side of the room. On this stage, was Eddie and his band setting up. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 kind of a crowd,\u201d Jonathan said with surprise as they all shuffled in. </p>\n<p>\u201cEddie way undersells them,\u201d Robin agreed. \u201cThis is more than \u2018a couple of drunks.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>The bar wasn\u2019t packed, but Robin was right. All the barstools were taken, and a fair amount of the tables, but Steve was already leading the group to where a few people were standing, waiting for the show to start. </p>\n<p>\u201cMunson,\u201d Steve called as he walked up to the stage. Eddie turned from where he was adjusting some of their equipment, a wide smile spreading his face as he saw Steve. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you actually get a crowd going.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington, you actually came,\u201d Eddie jumped down from the stage and immediately wrapped Steve into a quick hug, the sudden impact making Steve stagger back a bit as he reciprocated.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised, I\u2019m good for it occasionally,\u201d Steve smirked, but was finding it hard to keep his composure when Eddie looked <em>so good.</em></p>\n<p>Big brown eyes lined with smudged black eyeliner, hair teased up, and wearing his trademark leather jacket/denim vest duo. And, of course, Steve noticed his gift on his hand.</p>\n<p>Eddie arched an eyebrow, giving Steve a look up and down. He cocked his head to the side a bit, a smug smirk on his face when his eyes lingered on Steve\u2019s vest. He reached out and gave the lapels a tug, holding painfully piercing eye contact with Steve while doing so. </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s head swam, almost like he was drunk, but he just stared at Eddie like a smiling fool. Until Robin cleared her throat, stepping up with Vickie. This snapped Steve out of whatever trance he fell into, subsequently making his face burn red hot. He scratched the back of his head nervously, giving an awkward sniff. </p>\n<p>\u201cEr, yeah. I said I would bring groupies,\u201d Steve gestured to first Robin and Vickie, then Jonathan, Nancy, and Argyle. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Argyle smiled. \u201cCan you teach me some guitar before we go back to California?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Eddie seemed caught off guard by the question. \u201cYeah, sure, man. Come by\u2026 whenever,\u201d he shrugged, Argyle smiling and nodding. \u201cWell, I gotta get back to setting up. Thanks for comin\u2019 guys,\u201d Eddie smiled at them all before lingering on Steve, clapped his shoulder, and then hopped back on stage. Steve forced himself to face the group so he couldn\u2019t stare. </p>\n<p>When he noticed Robin and Vickie staring at him, he cleared his throat. \u201cIm uh\u2026 gonna get a Coke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Nancy, to his surprise, was the one who spoke. Steve gave a small smile and led her to the bar, a slightly awkward silence settling around them as they waited for the busy bartender.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Steve said, desperate to break the quiet. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before you guys head to school, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Nancy nodded. \u201cYup. Little over two weeks.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Steve breathed. \u201cFeel like you guys just got back from California.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nancy gave a halfhearted chuckle. \u201cMe too.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAbout college? Not at all,\u201d Nancy shook her head. \u201cAbout leaving Mike,\u201d she glanced at him. \u201cEveryone else\u2026 about long-distance with Jonathan\u2026 I\u2019m terrified about all of that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve nodded sympathetically. Hell, he was worried <em>for</em> her. What if it came back and they were scattered across the country? What if he needed her help to keep everyone safe? </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be alright, though,\u201d he was saying it for the both of them, because he needed to believe it just as desperately. Steve gave a small smile. \u201cI got Eddie to help keep the little monsters in line. Never thought I\u2019d say it, but I actually think he\u2019s a good influence on them.\u201d </p>\n<p>They both chuckled at this, Nancy observing Steve with an almost curious smile. \u201cI think he\u2019s a good influence on you, too.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve pulled a face of mock offense. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was so bad before.\u201d </p>\n<p>Nancy chuckled.\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t, but\u2026\u201d she bit her lip, staring at a spot on the bar as she thought for a moment. \u201cSometimes, especially after the Mind Flayer\u2026 it felt like you were kinda\u2026 checked out. And around him\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never seen you,\u201d she shook her head, briefly searching for the words. \u201cMore engaged with life, than you are when you\u2019re with Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve took a second, trying to digest the words. <em>Damn,</em> he thought, <em>And she wasn\u2019t even supposed to know.</em> Steve laughed, Nancy giving him an odd look. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothin,\u2019\u201d Steve said simply, a small shake of his head. \u201cThank you, Nance. Do me a favor and don\u2019t spend all your time at college worrying about the rest of us.\u201d The bartender came up not long after, Nancy and Steve returning to the group with their sodas. </p>\n<p>And as the lights dimmed before flashing bright onto the band, Steve never felt more sure of himself. The group cheered loudly as the lead singer introduced themselves as Corroded Coffin. The music started up, and then it was a blur from there.</p>\n<p>Eddie was amazing, not only playing guitar but singing backup. And maybe Steve was biased, but he brought more stage presence and energy than even the lead singer, often getting some of the crowd riled up by doing funny or downright impressive moves. </p>\n<p>One of the times he caught Steve\u2019s eye, he sent him a wink, and Steve thought he could shoot through the roof. The whole ordeal made him feel like a schoolgirl seeing her favorite boy band, and while it was embarrassing he found himself too wrapped up in Eddie\u2019s performance to care. It wasn\u2019t the sort of music he usually listened to, but Steve knew he\u2019d want to come to as many shows as Eddie would allow. Or, as many as he could attend without looking like a stalker, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould\u2019ve brought a bra,\u201d Steve thought aloud, earning a confused look from Robin beside him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he brushed off. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, this is our final song,\u201d Eddie was grabbing the mic, tilting it closer and all Steve could do was watch, mesmerized by the smallest things. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to dedicate it to\u2026\u201d he turned his gaze to Steve, gesturing to him. \u201cSteve Harrington, the best monster-killer in Hawkins!\u201d A few people clapped or hollered despite having no idea what Eddie was talking about, but it was mostly his group of friends hooting around him, Robin giving him a light jostle. Steve ignored the fact that he definitely was not the best monster-killer in Hawkins, as that was almost definitely Eleven or Hopper, and took the surge of pride that rushed through him.</p>\n<p>His face was no doubt fire engine red, but he couldn\u2019t stop staring up at Eddie, who was beaming at him from the spotlight. \u201cSeriously, that man will turn anything into a weapon,\u201d Eddie added, earning laughter only from his group of friends. Steve just shook his head at him with a stupid smile he couldn\u2019t get off his face. \u201cThis song\u2019s called; Ozzy\u2019s Prodigy,\u201d and then Eddie started a fast-pace guitar riff. </p>\n<p>The song was great; an amalgamation of bouncy drumlines and a plucky bass, plus a wildly impressive guitar solo from Eddie, the singer belting energetically about the end of the world. Honestly, it could\u2019ve been the worst song in the world and Steve couldn\u2019t care less, because Eddie actually took the fucking time to write him a song. And that was insane to him. The idea that someone would sit down and get inspired enough to make something about him was nearly unfathomable. For fuck\u2019s sake, just the confirmation that Eddie <em>thought about Steve in his downtime</em> was enough to make his head explode.</p>\n<p>The final chord rang out and despite the entire small venue offering up rowdy applause, Steve was determined to be the loudest in the crowd. He let out a long, loud whistle before yelling a deep \u201cYeah, Eddie!\u201d accompanied by violent applause. The band did a bow, and as they began packing up their equipment a few people began to filter out of the bar. </p>\n<p>Steve led the group up to the edge of the stage, all of them talking over each other in order to praise Eddie as he came over. \u201cPlease, please,\u201d Eddie said, smirking. \u201cI am but a man.\u201d He crouched down so he would be eye level with everyone, but was directly in front of Steve. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d he looked at everyone before his eyes fell on Steve. \u201cDid I impress?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201dUh, yeah,\u201d Argyle laughed. \u201cObviously, man. It was like, your guitar was making love to my ears.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve gave him a puzzled look before turning back to Eddie. \u201cYeah, what he said,\u201d Steve gave Eddie a lopsided smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, listen, I gotta help pack up\u2013 but! One of the guys is having a little after party at his house if you guys wanna come,\u201d Eddie raised his eyebrows at the group. \u201cHe lives right down the street from Robin.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and can I say?\u201d Robin chimed in. \u201cSometimes I see him mowing the lawn in nothing but tidey-wideys, drinking milk straight from the gallon.\u201d </p>\n<p>Everyone made various faces of disgust or confusion, except for Argyle, who said \u201cHey, dude. What a man does on his own property is his business.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jonathan was the one to move on, sharing a look with Nancy, her nodding, before he said \u201cWe\u2019re in. Thanks, Eddie.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cPossible milk fetish aside, I\u2019m down,\u201d she looked at Vickie, who was nodding in agreement. All eyes turned to Steve at that moment, and he gave a strained laugh. \u201cJeez, yeah, I\u2019ll come,\u201d he side eyed everyone, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cNow quit lookin\u2019 at me in unison, it\u2019s creepy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat, sounds like Robin knows where it is then,\u201d Eddie stood, looking down at everyone, but mostly Steve, as he said \u201cSee ya there.\u201d </p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>The band needed a little extra time to get everything loaded up, so Steve, Nancy, Robin, and Vickie had decided to get food while Jonathan and Argyle went home to grab\u2026 party favors. Stomach full and buzzing with excitement, Steve pulled his car next to a decently sized one-story house. </p>\n<p>Faint music and laughter could be heard coming from inside the house as Steve followed the girls to the front door. A guy Steve recognized as the drummer of Eddie\u2019s band opened the door, giving a hesitant, but nice enough, greeting to the group. </p>\n<p>It was more of a kickback than a party, really, Steve seeing mostly bandmates and only a few people that were standing for the show. Argyle and Jonathan were on the couch, two slices of pizza on each of their plates. </p>\n<p>Jonathan spotted them first, neither making any move to get up, but smiling widely at the group as they entered. \u201cHey, it\u2019s Nancy,\u201d Jonathan said happily, waving again at his girlfriend. Nancy chuckled. </p>\n<p>\u201cHaving fun, Jonathan?\u201d She smiled, taking a seat beside him. Steve felt an arm snake around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoo,\u201d Eddie said simply into Steve\u2019s ear, and it was amazing how many shivers one word could cause. Steve looked over at Eddie, smiling as always. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve breathed, a smile tugging at his own lips. \u201cYou were really good.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie made a show of looking like he was thinking, \u201cHmmm\u2026 Was I? Because if I recall correctly, that would mean I\u2019d have your bra right now.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve shook his head, unable to shake the grin from his face. He had no choice but to look at his shoes to get away from those <em>fucking eyes.</em> \u201cShut up,\u201d was all he could supply. At some point, and he didn\u2019t know when, Eddie\u2019s joke-flirting had become real-flirting, and Steve never found himself able to get used to it. Or maybe, Steve considered, he just never saw it before. But for some reason now he could see it so clearly; Eddie Munson was flirting with him. And it was driving him absolutely fucking crazy. </p>\n<p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d Eddie asked. </p>\n<p>Steve thought about it for a second before saying \u201cJust one beer. I\u2019m driving.\u201d Not a lie, but he was also enjoying\u2026 this. Whatever it was. And he wanted to remember as much of it\u2013 as it truly was\u2013 as he could. </p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Eddie said as he slid off Steve, grabbing him by the shoulders and turning to face him towards the kitchen, giving him the slightest of shoves forward. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re mostly-sober-buddies for the night.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMostly-sober-buddies,\u201d Steve repeated as he was led into the kitchen, which was small and empty. Eddie popped open the fridge and pulled out two beers a moment later, passing one to Steve. </p>\n<p>Steve nodded in thanks before opening it, leaning against the small, wooden kitchen island. Eddie jumped up on the counter opposite him, cracking open the beer and taking a sip. \u201cLoved the song, by the way,\u201d Steve smiled, teasing instincts kicking into full gear. \u201cWhat was that one line\u2026 \u2018Handsome\u2026 Hairy beast,\u2019 is that right?\u201d He <em>knew</em> this part. Someone liked him, and he liked them back. It didn\u2019t matter that it was Eddie Munson and not a girl, Steve knew how to charm people, and he was going to do it goddammit. </p>\n<p>And it was already working, an almost stunned look crossing Eddie\u2019s reddening face before he was shyly biting his lip and looking everywhere but Steve\u2019s eyes. \u201cShut up, it was like\u2026 a filler line. Didn\u2019t even think you\u2019d hear it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I heard it,\u201d Steve grinned as he pulled away from his beer can. \u201cNow will you tell Henderson that? I keep tellin\u2019 him the chest hair works on all the babes,\u201d he pointedly glanced Eddie up and down. </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s shock furthered as he laughed lightly, looking at Steve with morbid curiosity. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you tonight, Harrington?\u201d He smiled, face ablaze in a way that Steve didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever stop picturing. \u201cPay the bartender to slip you somethin\u2019 nice?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve pretended to think about this, \u201cNo,\u201d he said innocently, stepping forward from the island and taking a slow step toward Eddie. \u201cYou don\u2019t really use my name, Eddie,\u201d he kept his voice low and soft, the way that always drove girls crazy. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He came to stand in the space between Eddie\u2019s legs, not touching but so suffocatingly in his space Steve almost didn\u2019t know if he could keep his head screwed on enough to do this. But that <em>fucking look</em> in Eddie\u2019s eyes, pupils utterly blown out on already dark irises. They were endless, and though Steve often struggled baring the sight of such intensity right now he couldn\u2019t look away. </p>\n<p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Eddie trailed off, punctuating the sentence instead with a small shake of his head. </p>\n<p>Steve gave a languid sigh as he slid his beer can onto the counter beside Eddie, then plucked the can in Eddie\u2019s hand and did the same with his. \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d Their faces were inches apart and Steve thought his heart might hammer right out of his chest at any second. He couldn\u2019t help but drop his gaze to Eddie\u2019s lips, flicking them back up to his eyes after he was satisfied.</p>\n<p>Eddie didn\u2019t respond, looking at Steve almost like he was in a trance, big doe eyes blinking up at him. <em>Pretty.</em></p>\n<p>Steve tutted softly, inching his face a <em>fraction</em> closer, hands falling lightly on Eddie\u2019s knees as he did so. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Eddie? You\u2019re usually so talkative,\u201d Steve murmured, his lips so close to Eddie\u2019s now they brushed together as he said \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d But he wouldn\u2019t kiss him. Not yet. Instead he hovered there and began drumming his fingers lightly on the tops of Eddie\u2019s knees. He could feel Eddie\u2019s shallow breath fanning against his lips, and it nearly tore him apart holding back, but he didn\u2019t give in. \u201cWhat\u2019s my name, Eddie?\u201d Steve asked again. </p>\n<p>It was as if the air and time and everything in the world stilled around them, only leaving Steve and Eddie in motion. And then he breathed it out, barely a whisper: \u201cSteve.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could barely finish the word before Steve crashed his lips against Eddie\u2019s, his hands flying up to cup his face in tandem. Eddie barely wasted time responding, moving his lips just as hungrily as Steve moved his, Eddie\u2019s grabbing Steve\u2019s waist and pulling him impossibly closer.</p>\n<p>Steve trailed his hands down Eddie\u2019s shoulders as they kissed, then his sides. Then they hooked under Eddie\u2019s knees and gave a quick tug, pulling a startled noise out of Eddie as he yanked him to the edge of the counter, their entire fronts pressed together.</p>\n<p>It was rough and a little sloppy, but Steve didn\u2019t care as Eddie\u2019s hands came to fall around his neck, tugging at the hair there. Steve hummed gutterly into Eddie\u2019s mouth, his own hands exploring Eddie\u2019s waist under his jacket, getting mere brushes of skin from where his shirt lifted up with the friction. </p>\n<p>Nothing was enough, but damned his stupid lungs because he needed to <em>breathe</em> and how <em>dare</em> they not be able to survive off of Eddie alone? He broke the kiss, both of them gasping, noses still touching and eyes staring deeply into each other. Steve didn\u2019t lessen his tight grip on Eddie\u2019s body. He felt like he had to make up for all the times he didn\u2019t push himself, didn\u2019t go just that <em>little bit further</em> when it would\u2019ve been so easy. Like now that he could touch Eddie\u2013 <em>really</em> touch him, not just timid excuses\u2013 he never wanted to stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve Harrington,\u201d Eddie breathed out in awe, smiling into the words. </p>\n<p>Steve smiled back. \u201cNow you got it.\u201d They sat there like that for a moment, the muffled music filtering in from the living room, distant conversations being had, but all of it faded away. It was just Eddie and him.</p>\n<p>That is, until he heard Robin\u2019s voice outside of the closed door yelling \u201cNo\u2013 U-Uh, G-GARETH IS ENTERING THE KITCHEN! GARETH! ENTERING THE KITCHEN NOW!\u201d But even with her warning, Steve and Eddie only had enough time to look at each other in panic before the door swung open, revealing a very stunned Gareth and a stressed Robin standing behind him. </p>\n<p>Everyone was silent for a second, Robin, Steve, Eddie, and Gareth all looking between each other. Steve glanced between Robin and Eddie, and made an executive decision.</p>\n<p>Steve, not moving from his compromising position with Eddie, started to boo Gareth. \u201cBoooo. Boo, Gareth, Booo,\u201d With no further explanation, Eddie and Robin immediately started to heckle Gareth as well. </p>\n<p>\u201cBooo,\u201d Robin said, an uncertain look on her face as she went along with\u2026 whatever solution this was. \u201cB-bad Gareth\u2026 baaad Gareth.\u201d Gareth looked between all of them, mouth hanging open in astonished silence, clearly confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, <em>fuck you</em> Gareth,\u201d Eddie started going in, tone becoming more aggressive. Steve immediately matched the energy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck,</em> Gareth,\u201d Steve spat as he looked at Gareth like he had just done something deeply unsettling. Gareth\u2019s confusion started twisting into fear, still unable to say anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why are you being such a freak, Gareth?\u201d Robin was the last one to be heard, the room falling silent as the three of them mad-dogged Gareth, who couldn\u2019t settle who to look at to get an answer as to what he did.</p>\n<p>When he saw the stern, unbreaking looks of Steve, Eddie, and Robin, he deflated, hanging his head. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he said mopily, sulking out of the kitchen. </p>\n<p>The three stood\u2013 or in Eddie\u2019s case, sat\u2013 staring between one another for a moment after Gareth left. Robin\u2019s grinned almost creepily, and Steve knew he wouldn\u2019t hear the end of this. She didn\u2019t say a word as she backed out of the kitchen, still smiling, the door swinging closed behind her. </p>\n<p>Eddie and Steve looked at each other. They both burst into laughter, Steve letting his forehead rest against Eddie as they did so. Once their laughter died down, Eddie was the one who spoke first. \u201cAs much as I <em>very</em> badly want to continue this, we should probably head back out there. Plus I think we just emotionally damaged Gareth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Steve hummed in mock thoughtfulness. \u201cOr\u2026 what if we stay in here and barricade the door? I\u2019ve gotten really good at barricading doors.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s very good houseguest behavior, Stevie,\u201d Eddie replied, his hands playing with the hair at the nape of Steve\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat if instead we ditch this thing and you come over to mine?\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t stop the grin that split his face at Eddie\u2019s words. He didn\u2019t respond verbally, instead leaning in again for another kiss, but this time it was softer. Gentle and slow. Steve\u2019s fingers slid smoothly under Eddie\u2019s shirt and he felt the latter\u2019s breath hitch. Steve smiled into the kiss before breaking it. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to saying our goodbyes, then,\u201d with that, Steve finally unraveled himself from Eddie, the two of them leaving their barely started beers on the counter as they reentered the living room. Eddie\u2019s hand was on Steve\u2019s lower back, slipping under the vest but above his shirt as he led Steve back to their friends on the couch. Steve\u2019s stomach buzzed. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh,\u201d Steve said as he got their friends\u2019 attention. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna head out. Both kinda tired.\u201d It was an excuse he was pretty sure no one, besides maybe Argyle, believed. </p>\n<p>\u201cReal tired,\u201d Eddie echoed, a mischievous grin firmly in place. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries, I can take everyone home later,\u201d Jonathan said with a polite smile. Robin had a giant one on her own face, but to Steve\u2019s surprise she wasn\u2019t making any jokes, perhaps not wanting to delay their plans. </p>\n<p>They said their goodbyes, and as they were walking away he heard Robin yell \u201c<em>Seriously,</em> don\u2019t get pregnant!\u201d Steve chuckled as Eddie led them out of the house, the two of them stopping before they had to split to their separate cars. </p>\n<p>\u201cMeet you at mine?\u201d Eddie came around to stand in front of Steve, his hands playing with the collar of Steve\u2019s vest. </p>\n<p>\u201cTry and stop me,\u201d Steve snaked his hands around either side of Eddie\u2019s waist and gave a squeeze. He didn\u2019t know if he was being too much, and when Eddie bit his lip like that at him he didn\u2019t care. </p>\n<p>To Steve\u2019s dismay they broke apart, a fleeting look between them before Eddie finally got inside the van, Steve wasting no time getting to his own car. He didn\u2019t know what the rest of tonight would hold, but as long as it was more of Eddie Munson he didn\u2019t care. </p>\n<p>Steve barely had to wait a second after knocking on Eddie\u2019s door before he yanked it open, an excited smile on his face, eyeliner accentuating his bright eyes. Eddie gave a deep, purposely evil laugh before grabbing a fistful of Steve\u2019s shirt and tugging him inside the trailer, shutting the door behind him. Steve felt adoration bloom deep in his core, and he was sure his face showed it. Finally, he\u2019d stopped caring that it did. </p>\n<p>Eddie pushed Steve easily onto the couch, smiles plastered to both of their faces as Eddie rested one knee on the other side of Steve\u2019s leg, taking his chin in between his thumb and forefinger. Steve swam in his gaze. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Steve,\u201d he spoke softly but his words were so loud in Steve\u2019s head. He didn\u2019t think anyone had called him that before. Never knew that he would enjoy hearing it. His hand snaked up the thigh of Eddie\u2019s bent knee, the other moving up his waist as he stared up at the miraculous man above him. Steve could almost laugh at how intense this feeling was.</p>\n<p>Instead he ran his hands over Eddie, still careful of not crossing more lines than he may be allowed. God, he hoped one day he\u2019d be allowed.</p>\n<p>Eddie slowly dipped his head down lower, not releasing Steve\u2019s chin as his eyes flicked to Steve\u2019s lips before pressing them to his own. Steve pressed back hungrily, but Eddie\u2019s hold on his chin kept him slow. Eddie broke the kiss as Steve lowered him into his lap. </p>\n<p>Steve was silently pulled into another slow but deep kiss, Eddie\u2019s hands traveling over his chest and shoulders. The denim vest seemed to cause him frustration because he tugged Steve a bit by the lapels, a maddening growl rumbling from his throat. \u201cAs hot as you look in this, I\u2019d very much like it off now,\u201d he said against Steve\u2019s lips. </p>\n<p>Steve smirked, hands tugging on Eddie by his own vest. \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours,\u201d he teased, reveling in how quickly Eddie\u2019s face turned beat red, but his smile never leaving. </p>\n<p> Eddie released Steve\u2019s vest and leaned back enough to take off his jacket/vest combo, tossing it next to the couch. \u201cShow me yours,\u201d he challenged in a low voice, smirking down at Steve from where he straddled his lap. Steve, eagerly and with great urgency, removed his vest and threw it in the general area of Eddie\u2019s. This gained a laugh from Eddie. </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s hands were moving slowly up and down Eddie\u2019s sides, the older boy cupping his face with his hands. His thumbs brushed gently over the peaks of Steve\u2019s cheekbones. Steve just inspected his eyes in the pale blue light that blanketed both of them, his stomach fluttering as Eddie\u2019s thumbs trailed softly down his face, grazing his jawline. He was utterly defenseless under Eddie\u2019s stare, but no part of him was fighting back anyway. </p>\n<p>And then Eddie was pressing their lips back together, his hands more freely exploring Steve\u2019s chest and shoulders now that the vest wasn't impeding. Steve gripped at Eddie\u2019s sides, desperate to just have <em>more</em> of him, but it wasn\u2019t enough. </p>\n<p>In one fluid movement, Steve hooked his hands under Eddie\u2019s thighs, the latter letting out a small cry of surprise as Steve stood up, flipping Eddie onto his back on the couch. Eddie gave a light grunt on impact, followed by what Steve thought was the most intoxicating giggle he\u2019d ever heard. As he looked at Eddie\u2019s smiling face, he couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d gone so long without\u2026 <em>this.</em></p>\n<p>He was staring at Eddie\u2019s lips, and before he could stop himself his thumb was brushing delicately over his bottom lip. And then, Eddie was looking up at him with those big brown eyes and <em>wrapping his mouth around Steve's thumb and sucking.</em> He swore he\u2019d died right then, mouth hanging open in disbelief at the absolute pornography that was Eddie Munson\u2019s face. He more than had a problem in his jeans, now.</p>\n<p>When Eddie pulled off with a soft \u2018<em>pop</em>,\u2019 Steve hung his head a little, chuckling as he shook it. He looked back up at Eddie, his own eyes wide in an attempt to take in as much as he could of the boy below him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna fucking kill me, Munson,\u201d he groaned, collapsing on top of Eddie, who chuckled in his ear at the sudden weight. Steve rested his cheek on Eddie\u2019s chest, his arms wrapped around his sides as much as the couch would allow and legs entangled together. Eddie\u2019s hand threaded through Steve\u2019s hair, earning a deep hum from Steve as his eyes fell shut. </p>\n<p>\u201cWho knew Steve Harrington got hard just from kissing,\u201d Eddie teased below him. Steve rotated his head so his chin was resting on Eddie\u2019s chest instead, shooting him a glare that surely fell flat due to the massive smile on his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Steve said sarcastically, cocking his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s this then?\u201d He ground his hips into Eddie\u2019s, where he could tell the other was also hard, and was rewarded by Eddie\u2019s eyes fluttering shut, a suppressed hum rumbling through his body. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, okay, point made, Harrington,\u201d Eddie gave him a quick tug on his hair, Steve\u2019s own lids falling shut just a little at the gesture. \u201cBut I feel that\u2019s to be expected of the dude who was, reminding you once again, head of the D&amp;D club in high school.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I can\u2019t believe someone who used to be head of the D&amp;D club got me hard,\u201d Steve teased, but the sentiment was formed from truth. </p>\n<p>\"My point exactly!\" Eddie laughed, raising his eyebrows at Steve. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I never thought I\u2019d go for a pretty jock,\u201d Eddie's hand started slowly massaging Steve\u2019s head. </p>\n<p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m not your type?\u201d Steve asked in a mockingly offended tone, finding it hard to keep up the unbothered aura with Eddie's fingers in his hair. Eddie rolled his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, obviously you are,\u201d Eddie let his other hand rest on Steve\u2019s back. \u201cBut I always figured I\u2019d be into some\u2026 artsy musician dude. All about his art or whatever.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like a douchebag,\u201d Steve mused, turning back onto his cheek as he soaked up all of Eddie\u2019s idle touches. </p>\n<p>\u201cHuh, guess you really are my type, then,\u201d Eddie said in a puzzled tone, earning raised eyebrows from a smiling Steve, who had now lifted his head to properly scold him. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Eddie,\u201d Steve patronized as he pushed himself up onto his hands, hovering over the man below him. \u201cPoor, foolish Eddie,\u201d he braced the side of Eddie\u2019s face with one hand, lowering his lips until they spoke against Eddie\u2019s ear: \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen how mean I can be.\u201d Steve caught the other's earlobe lightly between his teeth and tugged, earning a small gasp from Eddie as his hands flew to Steve\u2019s back, as if for stability. </p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t let up, however, trailing wet, sucking kisses down Eddie\u2019s neck. When he got to the crook of his neck, Eddie let out a long hum, hands moving more desperately across Steve\u2019s back. Steve took this as his sign, and ever so lightly bit down on Eddie\u2019s sensitive spot, earning an outright <em>whine</em>. He smiled into Eddie\u2019s neck, feeling accomplished. </p>\n<p>Though, in reality he\u2019d made the situation worse for himself as well, Steve letting out a frustrated groan. He collapsed back onto Eddie. \u201cYou making noises like that is gonna make it really hard to stop, Munson,\u201d his words were muffled as they were spoken into a mixture of Eddie\u2019s neck and hair. </p>\n<p>He chuckled under Steve. \u201cPretty sure you started it, and\u2026\u201d Eddie hesitated for a moment, his movements on the back of Steve\u2019s head momentarily stalling as he pointedly caught Steve's eye. \u201cDo you <em>want</em> to stop?\u201d A tentative silence rang out, not awkward, but charged. </p>\n<p>Steve sat up then, straddling Eddie and looking down at his chest instead of his face. He slid his hands along Eddie\u2019s forearms before moving both of his hands to hold one of Eddie\u2019s, the one with the sword and shield ring on it. He inspected Eddie\u2019s hand, letting his thumb brush all over the angular joints Steve had studied so many times. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know if I\u2026 can yet.\u201d </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t feel\u2026 scared to say it, per se. Steve knew Eddie wouldn\u2019t pressure him into anything, but he didn\u2019t want him to be disappointed regardless. \u201cI want to\u2013 <em>really</em> badly,\u201d Steve emphasized, taking care to catch Eddie\u2019s eye as he did so. \u201cBut\u2026 I <em>just</em> found out I like guys not too long ago. I mean,\u201d Steve breathed a laugh. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake I didn\u2019t even know there was a <em>word</em> for what I... am.\u201d Eddie let his free hand fall at the top of Steve\u2019s thigh, toward his knee, his thumb gently stroking as he gave Steve an encouraging smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be anything to take away from\u2026 <em>that.</em> And, I dunno, I think I\u2019ll be too in my head about it.\u201d Steve looked at Eddie uncertainly. \u201cIs that stupid?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s brows knitted together for a second. \u201cNo, Steve, why would that be stupid?\u201d Eddie breathed a soft laugh, removing his hand from Steve\u2019s and placing it on the other leg, sitting up so he and Steve were barely inches apart. \u201cIt makes total sense. Plus\u2026\u201d Eddie ran his hands up Steve\u2019s thighs before bringing them back down. Steve\u2019s eyes fluttered shut at the sensation, his hips subconsciously bucking forward. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the time in the world.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve looked at Eddie timidly. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course I\u2019m sure, Stevie,\u201d Eddie gave him a lopsided smile. Steve couldn\u2019t help himself; he cupped Eddie\u2019s face again and gave him a long, hard kiss. Then, he did what he\u2019s been dying to do for fucking ages now; run his hands through that magnificent hair. Their lips moved roughly against each other as soft hair entangled his fingers, really properly <em>feeling</em> it. And <em>god</em> when he pulled on Eddie\u2019s hair his mouth fell open and he <em>moaned.</em></p>\n<p>They broke apart, leaning on each other and panting slightly. Steve let his head fall onto Eddie\u2019s shoulder with a soft laugh, already regretting his choice to stop but knowing it was the right one. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight, Stevie, I hate to cut this short, but I\u2019m afraid if we don\u2019t stop now it\u2019s gonna be a painful night for both of us,\u201d Eddie chuckled lightly in Steve\u2019s ear, giving his bicep a pat. </p>\n<p>Steve let out a frustrated groan, sitting up straight and closing his eyes in annoyance. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have figured this out sooner?\u201d He asked no one in particular, maybe the universe.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, Harrington, I\u2019ve been waiting,\u201d Eddie smirked, watching Steve's pouting with amusement. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Steve opened his eyes, raising his eyebrows at Eddie. \u201cHow long?\u201d He said it like a challenge.</p>\n<p>Eddie hummed thoughtfully, genuinely thinking back. \u201cWell, I certainly <em>wished</em> for it during the time fighting Vecna. Specifically the night we killed him. You and I ended up being the only ones awake after all of it.\u201d Eddie was looking somewhere far off, a reminiscent smile on his face. \u201cI really wanted it to be true then. But\u2026\u201d he seemed to bring himself back to the moment. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t know for sure until the carnival. Up until then it was just\u2026 a bunch of debating with myself. And occasionally Robin. I think even Henderson caught on eventually.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve smiled at this. \u201cRobin? How long has she known your thoughts, then?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie breathed a laugh. \u201cI think she knew I liked you before I did, actually. Helped me realize that, <em>'yes, you\u2019re into Steve Harrington, of all people.'</em>\u201d Steve laughed at this. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t start going to her for advice until after Vecna was dead. Basically put it off until I felt like I was going crazy and needed an outside opinion whether or not I was making it all up in my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaking what up in your head?\u201d Steve asked. </p>\n<p>Eddie looked sheepish, unable to look at Steve\u2019s face as one hand gestured vaguely to the air. \u201cLittle things that you would do. Teasing me more than others, but never actually in a rude way. Leaning into my touch. Looking at me the way that you did sometimes.\u201d Eddie gave a weak laugh. \u201cI mean, seriously, Harrington, you are hard to read. For a long time Robin couldn\u2019t tell either, constantly changing her answer every time you would interact with me again.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve smirked. \u201cWell, if it makes either of you feel better, I seemed to be the last to know out of all of you. So you clearly read me better than I read myself.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not saying much,\u201d Eddie teased, earning a glare with no real heat from Steve. </p>\n<p>He carded his fingers through Eddie\u2019s hair, just taking in the sight of his skin and sparkling eyes in the moonlight. \u201cAlright,\u201d Steve gave a long, exasperated sigh before climbing off of Eddie, pulling him off the couch by the hand. \u201cWe should go to bed before you make this more of a challenge.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt pains me to say I think you\u2019re right,\u201d Eddie said with a sigh as Steve led them to Eddie\u2019s room. Eddie dropped Steve\u2019s hand to rummage through his dresser drawers. Steve found the loss of contact intolerable, taking a few steps until he was pressed against Eddie\u2019s back, sliding his hands onto his waist. Eddie chuckled as one of Steve\u2019s hands gently pulled back his hair, allowing him access to bury his face in Eddie\u2019s neck, kissing lightly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington\u2026\u201d Eddie sang in a playfully scolding voice. Steve smiled into his neck, humming innocently. \u201cBehave,\u201d Eddie said sternly, turning around and pressing clothes into Steve\u2019s chest. Steve gave a goofy roll of his eyes, smile firmly in place as he tossed the clothes on the bed behind him. He held intense eye contact as he pulled his shirt off over his head. </p>\n<p>Eddie shook his head, also unable to wipe the smile from his face. \u201cYou\u2019re insufferable, you know that?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve arched a coy brow before he unbuttoned his pants, pushing them down so he was only in his boxers. \u201cNo!\u201d Eddie gave a dramatic gasp, his hands flying to cover his face. \u201cYour <em>modesty</em>!\u201d He exclaimed before parting his fingers, allowing him to pointedly look Steve up and down. The latter laughed at this before tugging Eddie\u2019s shirt on, opting to leave the sweatpants and remain in boxers. Eddie yanked off his own shirt, snatching the sweatpants off the bed as he muttered, almost to himself, \u201cYou\u2019re evil, Steve Harrington.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sat on the foot of Eddie\u2019s bed, leaning back onto his hands as he simply watched Eddie change into sweatpants, a ferocious blush visible on his face even in the pale glow of his room. Eddie shook his head lightly, ruffling Steve\u2019s hair as he passed by. \u201cC\u2019mon, Stevie. Dental health is important, and I got an extra toothbrush since you were here last.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWere you anticipating me, Munson?\u201d Steve grinned as he followed Eddie into the bathroom, a fresh toothbrush being pushed into his hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Eddie mumbled, the two brushing their teeth together before returning to Eddie\u2019s room and climbing into bed. </p>\n<p>Steve glanced over at Eddie and shook his head. \u201cNo, Eddie, man, you gotta wear a shirt. I won\u2019t survive this time,\u201d Steve covered his face with his hands as he spoke, letting them fall to see if Eddie would listen. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Eddie said sarcastically, rolling his eyes. \u201cAs if you in nothing but boxers and my shirt isn\u2019t torture.\u201d But he was already getting up, tugging on another shirt before flopping back beside Steve. \u201cSatisfied, Harrington?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said thoughtfully. \u201cBut that\u2019s the point.\u201d They were lying on their sides facing each other, the silence wrapping around them like a warm blanket as Steve could do nothing else but look into Eddie\u2019s eyes. </p>\n<p>But, as Steve was coming to realize, having Eddie in front of him without touching the boy was practically impossible. His hand tentatively reached out, sliding over Eddie\u2019s waist and gripping lightly, his fingers stroking softly over the cloth there. </p>\n<p>And <em>god</em> Eddie was looking at him so fondly as his own hand came up to caress Steve\u2019s face, thumb brushing over his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to end,\u201d Eddie said suddenly, voice quiet and face pensive. </p>\n<p>Steve furrowed his brows a bit, giving Eddie\u2019s side a squeeze. \u201cDoes it have to?\u201d He asked genuinely, a tinge of a smile on his face at Eddie\u2019s seemingly abrupt thoughts. </p>\n<p>Eddie gave a half shrug, his eyes falling down to somewhere around Steve\u2019s collarbone. \u201cI dunno. Good things don\u2019t usually\u2026 stick around for me,\u201d and when those big brown eyes reconnected with Steve he saw an almost longing fear. The urgency to wipe any traces of it from usually such joyful eyes overwhelmed Steve, him inching forward and pulling Eddie closer, arm wrapping around the boy fully. </p>\n<p>He gave a small smile before saying \u201cWell, Munson. Careful what you wish for. It\u2019s gonna take a lot to get rid of me. You'll be sick of me soon enough.\u201d He was rewarded by possibly the most genuine smile he\u2019d seen in his life, Eddie\u2019s face radiating so much adoration it was practically enough to light up the dark room. Steve pulled Eddie into him, holding him tightly and pressing his face into the crook of the older boy\u2019s neck. Vanilla and sweet cologne swirled around him, and Steve fell asleep with Eddie wrapped in his arms, impossibly close.</p>\n<p>\"Couldn't dream of it, Harrington.\" </p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>Steve awoke to streaks of sunlight flitting through Eddie\u2019s window, casting abstract shapes of gold around the room. A look at Eddie showed he was the first to wake, something he was incredibly thankful for.</p>\n<p>Eddie looked so peaceful, lips parted slightly and dark eyelashes dusting his cheeks. Steve was lying on his back with Eddie resting his head on his chest, Eddie's hand curling the fabric into a ball. One of Eddie\u2019s legs was thrown over Steve, the older boy pressed entirely into Steve\u2019s side. He smiled to himself, the arm around Eddie\u2019s shoulders tightening as his other hand glided over Eddie\u2019s thigh, rubbing up and down in slow, gentle motions. Steve didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get tired of Eddie being this close, even if it were for days on end. </p>\n<p>The hand around Eddie\u2019s shoulder fell to his side, just gripping and feeling the solid form underneath his palms. As if Steve were trying to convince him this was real and not a dream; the man beneath him wouldn't disappear. Eddie stirred, trying to push even closer to Steve, his face scrunching up a bit as he slowly woke, his grip on Steve\u2019s (Eddie\u2019s) shirt tightening. </p>\n<p>Steve watched fondly as Eddie\u2019s eyes blinked open, sleep glazing over his eyes as he came to consciousness. His eyes fell on his own hand on Steve\u2019s chest, and as it all seemed to click into place, Eddie looked up at Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Eddie said quietly, earning a small chuckle from Steve below him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Eddie,\u201d Steve responded in amusement, voice raspy from disuse. \u201cSleep well?\u201d He asked in a teasing tone. </p>\n<p>Eddie rolled his eyes, but his smile betrayed him. \u201cYeah, yeah. How did you sleep?\u201d <em>God</em> Eddie\u2019s morning voice was enough to make Steve want to pin him down to the bed right then and there.</p>\n<p>Steve just looked at Eddie for a second before simply saying \u201cBest sleep of my life.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie gave a scoff, but a blush was spreading over his face. \u201cYeah, sure it was, Harrington.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve had to of had a best night\u2019s sleep at some point in my life, why couldn\u2019t it have been last night?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you say, Stevie,\u201d Eddie smiled, sitting up only for Steve to quickly yank him back down on top of him. Eddie let out a yelp of surprise before laughing into Steve\u2019s chest, now lying fully on top of him. </p>\n<p>Steve idly played with Eddie\u2019s hair as the boy maneuvered his head to give Steve a playful glare. \u201cGotcha,\u201d Steve said impishly. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone ever told you that you\u2019re ridiculous?\u201d Eddie asked, Steve giving a mockingly thoughtful look. </p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone might\u2019ve mentioned it once or twice,\u201d he mused, tucking some of Eddie\u2019s hair behind his ear and letting his hand trail down his shoulder. Eddie sat up with a sigh, now effectively straddling Steve and <em>dear lord</em> the view of Eddie looking down at him from that position was about to be a problem. </p>\n<p>Steve chuckled to himself, shaking his head as Eddie looked at him curiously. \u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie asked, and he seemed genuinely unaware of his actions this time. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me, Eddie,\u201d Steve groaned, his hands brushing languidly up and down the tops of Eddie\u2019s thighs. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie said innocently. \u201cThat's all?\u201d And with that, to Steve\u2019s biggest disappointment, he rolled off of Steve and got out of bed, stretching. </p>\n<p>Steve huffed a laugh. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s all. Just my death, no biggie.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie turned over his shoulder to smile at Steve. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be the dramatic one, Harrington.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie started a pot of coffee before joining Steve in brushing his teeth, neither bothering to change out of their sleep clothes. Eddie began rummaging around to make breakfast, calling with his head inside the fridge \u201cHow do you like your eggs?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve leaned his forearms against the kitchen counter, just observing Eddie as he moved about, Steve wracking his brain but coming up short. \u201cNope. There's a joke in there somewhere, but I can't find it,\" he sighed defeatedly, before supplying \"Scrambled.\u201d The stove clicked on and Eddie placed a pan over the burner, grabbing two mugs and filling them as the coffee finished. \u201cWant help?\u201d Steve asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of host would I be?\u201d Eddie smiled, pushing a cup of coffee over to Steve. \u201cJust make your coffee how you like it,\u201d he brought out milk and sugar, leaving Steve to his fixings. </p>\n<p>\u201cYessir,\u201d Steve mumbled happily as he began mixing his coffee. They chatted idly as Eddie made breakfast, Steve feeling more than accomplished every time he managed to fluster Eddie. He felt it was only fair he got his turn, considering Eddie spent so long messing with Steve\u2019s head. Steve wondered how much Eddie had known the crisis he caused with nearly every little thing, but there was no way to tell. Though, knowing Eddie, he was far from innocent. </p>\n<p>They sat on the couch now, food finished and talking over their second cups of coffee. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never asked,\u201d Steve started, leaning against his elbow propped on the back of the couch. They were facing each other, but Steve had pulled Eddie\u2019s legs into his lap, his free hand resting over his knee. \u201cYou plan on going to college?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie barked a laugh at this. \u201cDo I seem like the college type, Steve?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve shrugged genuinely. \u201cYou could be. If you wanted to.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times I gotta remind you I graduated high school at twenty?\u201d Eddie smiled, but Steve just shook his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d He asked. \u201cYou could go to community college if you wanted. Save up. I could help,\u201d he offered genuinely, running his hand briefly up and down Eddie\u2019s thigh. Lord knew he had money to spare, and even if his parents wouldn\u2019t help he\u2019d be more than willing to put aside some of his paycheck from Family Video. </p>\n<p>\u201cAwful kind of you, Stevie, but I don\u2019t feel like going into debt when I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019d study,\u201d Eddie said, and Steve nodded. It was a fair point. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s dealing drugs and playing at shitty bars\u2013\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve scolded. \u201cYou were good, though.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cApparently so,\u201d Eddie laughed. \u201cGot you to kiss me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve gazed into Eddie\u2019s eyes, his eyes flicking to his lips for just a second before he said. \u201cNah, I would\u2019ve done that anyway.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWere certainly taking your time,\u201d Eddie smirked over the rim of his mug, taking a sip. </p>\n<p>\u201cListen, not my fault no one bothered to tell me I was bisexual,\u201d Steve grinned, earning a laugh from Eddie. It felt... weird to say it out loud. Not in a bad or good way, just... different.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuppose not,\u201d Eddie conceded. His face settled into one a little bit more serious, a flash of that fearful look he had in his eyes last night. \u201cWhat about you? Hawkins getting too small for the likes of Steve Harrington?\u201d </p>\n<p>He let out a thoughtful sigh. \u201cI dunno. Maybe one day I\u2019ll go to college, but like you said, kinda no point when you don\u2019t know what you wanna do.\u201d Steve gave a brief raise of his eyebrows, adding, \u201cThough it\u2019d certainly get my parents off my back. But for now\u2026\u201d Steve met Eddie\u2019s gaze again. \u201cHawkins has too many reasons to stick around.\u201d</p>\n<p>A smile split Eddie\u2019s face. \u201cYou already got me, Harrington, no reason to lay the charm on so thick.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I when your reaction is so entertaining?\u201d Steve questioned rhetorically. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, say Hawkins\u2026 didn\u2019t have any reason to stick around,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cWhere would you go?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Steve tilted his head back in consideration. \u201cI used to think I wanted to go to New York. Get some excitement,\u201d he gave a snort. \u201cBut after everything\u2026 I think I\u2019ve had enough excitement for a lifetime. So I guess I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d Steve shrugged. \u201cWhat about you? If you could go anywhere, where would it be?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie thought about this, staring into his coffee for a moment. \u201cI always wanted to go to California, honestly. It sounds\u2026 less cramped,\u201d he had a far off look in his eyes as he spoke. \u201cToo many people for everyone to know me\u2026 Ya know, I just <em>barely</em> beat the murder charges\u2026\u201d Eddie worked his bottom lip in between his teeth with worry. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t really think highly of me before\u2026 and now\u2026\u201d Eddie shook his head with a meek shrug. An overwhelming urge filled Steve then; the urge to walk around with Eddie like his personal bodyguard, threatening anyone who dared to look at the sweet guy in front of him the wrong way. He imagined this might get annoying to Eddie, however. And wasn't very practical, legally that is.</p>\n<p>The hand on Eddie\u2019s knee moved to grab his free hand, interlacing their fingers together. \u201cI\u2019ve been to California a few times on family vacations. It\u2019s nice. I think you\u2019d fit in there,\u201d Steve smiled softly, glad that the dejected look on Eddie\u2019s face was subsiding. \u201cMaybe I can take you someday.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie chuckled at this. \u201cThat sounds great, Steve, but if you whisked me away to California I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever come back.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s brows furrowed in the slightest. \u201cWho said we\u2019d have to come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie beamed at him, one of those full-blown grins that have nothing but fascination and genuine happiness brimming behind his eyes. Steve felt like he was walking on the moon. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sort of a fantastic person, Eddie Munson,\u201d Steve said softly. He\u2019d never thought he\u2019d enjoy looking at a human being so much, and frankly he couldn\u2019t see the wonder ever wearing off. </p>\n<p>Eddie leaned in and kissed Steve, gentle and soft as to not spill their coffees, but long and slow. Steve broke it just enough for them to rest their mugs on the table, before pulling Eddie back into the kiss by his face, hands framing either side. </p>\n<p>Steve had just pushed Eddie\u2019s back onto the couch, hands traveling up under his shirt, when a loud knock at the door broke them apart. They froze like that, Steve hovering over Eddie as they both looked at the door, then each other. </p>\n<p>\u201cUncle forget his keys or something?\u201d Steve murmured as he reluctantly climbed off Eddie, who stood up and walked to the door with a confused look on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not supposed to be back until Tuesday,\u201d Eddie informed, another loud round of knocking rapping the door before he could open it. \u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Eddie called, yanking the door open. </p>\n<p>Once again, earing a long groan from Steve, there stood Mike Wheeler. His bike was forgotten behind him and his eyes were wide, but slightly less fear than last time. \u201cWheeler,\u201d Eddie sighed. \u201cOf course it\u2019s you.\u201d Eddie stepped aside, barely able to finish his \u201cCome in,\u201d before Mike was entering the trailer.</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s eyes fell on Steve again, and he could practically see the gears clicking in his younger friend\u2019s head. Steve simply raised his eyebrows, taking a slow sip of his coffee as he waited for the other shoe to drop. Realization didn\u2019t cross Mike\u2019s face until Eddie sat down close to Steve, slinging his arm over Steve\u2019s shoulders and picking up his coffee with his free hand.</p>\n<p>Eddie smirked, clearly proud of the delighted confusion this struck the boy with. \u201cWhat\u2019s up now, Mike?\u201d Eddie asked, sipping from his own mug. </p>\n<p>\u201cWait\u2026 so you two <em>are</em> together?\u201d Mike asked, as if he had been going back and forth over that for awhile. \u201cFor how long?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Very</em> recently,\u201d Eddie emphasized, giving Mike a pointed look. </p>\n<p>\u201cGet to the point, Wheeler,\u201d Steve urged as Mike sat cross legged on the floor. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he played timidly with a thread on his pants. \u201cWill is\u2026 kinda my boyfriend.\u201d And even though Mike wore a faint, genuine smile\u2013 something Steve rarely saw on such an angsty kid\u2013 he could tell something was eating at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, you know how to bury a lead,\u201d Steve gave Mike\u2019s knee an encouraging shove with his foot. \u201cWhy\u2019s that not a good thing?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cN-no!\u201d Mike was quick to correct. \u201cIt is, I just\u2026 I\u2019m having a hard time\u2026\u201d Mike let out a frustrated groan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this without sounding like an asshole. Or like <em>Will\u2019s</em> the problem, when he\u2019s not at <em>all,</em>\u201d Mike was rambling in a way that reminded Steve a lot of Nancy, but Eddie cut in, dropping the annoyed act while keeping his tone lighthearted. </p>\n<p>\u201cWheeler, we can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell us what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Eddie breathed a laugh. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve had a lot of fucked up thoughts. I think it\u2019s inevitable, considering what we\u2019ve gone through\u2026 in multiple ways.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve gave Mike a nonchalant look, trying to convey to him that talking about this stuff wasn\u2019t a big deal. Even if Steve still found it hard to talk about himself. \u201cNo one\u2019s gonna judge you, kid.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mike took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cI know you told me\u2026 being bisexual is a thing. And I believe you\u2013 but\u2026\u201d Mike let out a sigh, continuing in a small, quiet voice as he said \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard for me to\u2026 I dunno, see myself as someone who\u2026 likes guys?\u201d He shook his head, as if he wasn\u2019t communicating what was in his head properly. \u201cLike, I know I do, because I like Will,\u201d he gave a little scoff, \u201cI <em>really</em> like Will. But it\u2019s like\u2026 I never thought <em>I</em> would be\u2026 gay. God, I don\u2019t think any of that made sense.\u201d Mike put his face in his hands. </p>\n<p>It felt like a rubber band snapped against Steve\u2019s heart. He wouldn\u2019t parade it around, but he really loved these kids, and to see one of them so broken up and lost over the <em>exact same thing</em> he had tugging at the back of his mind was really hard. Especially because he didn\u2019t have an answer for Mike. But seeing someone else so torn over his same problem\u2013 especially someone who was younger\u2013 it made all the things Steve was getting hung up on seem less relevant. </p>\n<p>\u201cListen, kid,\u201d Steve put his mug on the coffee table, sitting forward a bit and leaning his forearms on his knees. He sighed, clasping his hands and rubbing them together as he searched for what he needed to say. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest with you. I don\u2019t have the slightest fucking idea about\u2026 any of this,\u201d Steve gestured to the general company. \u201cI just came to the same realization you\u2019re coming to. And, up until somewhat recently, if you had asked me if I liked anyone other than girls, I would\u2019ve told you a strong \u2018no.\u2019 Not because I was against it, but just because I was <em>so sure</em> it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Steve took a moment again, trying to find some semi-neat way to wrap all this up. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut now here I am, caring for a guy more than I\u2019ve cared for\u2026 anyone. I think maybe ever,\u201d he winced after he said this. \u201cNo offense, ya know, to your sister. I\u2019d risk my life for her\u2013 I literally have\u2013 but as a friend.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Steve, I really don\u2019t care what you think about my sister,\u201d Mike assured, urging Steve to get to the point. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right. Point is, whether I ever thought\u2013 or even think now\u2013 that I would be someone who likes guys\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter. Because I do like a guy,\u201d Steve felt his whole face and neck go red as he said, while still looking at Mike, \u201cI like a guy <em>a fucking lot.</em> So\u2026 the way I look at it I have two options. Option one: I push this\u2026 <em>thing</em>-- that I know I feel-- down. Don\u2019t give it room to breathe,\u201d Steve\u2019s voice trembled in the slightest as he spoke again, \u201cAnd I go my whole life-- never even\u2026 <em>trying,</em>\u201d Steve cleared his throat, then gave a nervous chuckle, caught off guard by how emotional he was getting.</p>\n<p>He felt Eddie\u2019s hand rub soothing circles on his back. Steve took a breath and shook his head a bit to clear it. \u201cOr, option two: I take it day by day. I see my boyfriend,\u201d Steve didn\u2019t even notice what he\u2019d said, Eddie\u2019s hand halting its movements. \u201cWe spend time together. And\u2026 I do that over and over again, until I become the kind of guy who likes guys in my mind. And hopefully for a long time after that.\u201d Steve gave a lopsided smile, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb at Eddie. \u201cOr until Eddie stops letting me come around.\u201d </p>\n<p>Mike and Steve laughed a bit at this, Steve leaning back into Eddie\u2019s arm. \u201cSo, did any of that help or was I just talking out of my ass?\u201d Steve held his hands open to the ceiling for a second before grabbing his coffee and taking a long sip. </p>\n<p>\u201cSurprisingly\u2026\u201d Mike shrugged. \u201cYeah, I think that actually helped.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThank god,\u201d Steve breathed into his cup. Eddie gave him an encouraging pat on his shoulder, and for the first time since his little speech, Steve looked at him. His eyes looked almost glassy, still rimmed with traces of smudge eyeliner, but he had a pleasant smile on his face. There was so much intensity in Eddie\u2019s gaze Steve felt like he\u2019d fallen into a hole, and that look was the only thing tethering him to reality, preventing him from sinking into nothing. <em>Oh, you\u2019re in deep, Harrington.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 gonna go\u2026\u201d Mike finalized as he stood up, fishing both Steve and Eddie out of wherever they just fell. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey\u2013 maybe start calling before you come over, Wheeler,\u201d Eddie commented as Mike opened the door, looking over his shoulder at the older boys on the couch. His brows knitted together, first in confusion as he took in Eddie\u2019s words, then again with a disgusted face as he realized Eddie\u2019s implication. Steve laughed, deeply entertained by this reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, will definitely be doing that now,\u201d Mike said pointedly, face still contorted uncomfortably. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and,\u201d Steve said, causing Mike to turn back once more. \u201cCongratulations, Wheeler.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mike genuinely smiled at this. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to use protection,\u201d Steve added with an encouraging wink, both he and Eddie devolving into laughter as Mike pulled another disturbed face. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you listen to that,\u201d Eddie pointed at Mike, shouting out a quick \u201cSafety is sexy!\u201d As the younger boy slammed the door shut in a rush, leaving them alone, still laughing. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe death of me,\u201d Steve muttered with a fond shake of his head, finishing his coffee and placing the empty cup on the table. That was when he realized Eddie was staring at him in that way he did when he was <em>really looking.</em> \u201cWhat do those pretty brown eyes see, Munson?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie bit his lip, not answering right away as he took in whatever it was he saw. Then, a smug grin stretched his face. He raised his eyebrows, \u201cI\u2019m your boyfriend, huh?\u201d Steve\u2019s face fell, instantly blazing hotter than the sun.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, that was, uh\u2013 I guess I got caught up talkin\u2019 to the kid\u2013\u201d Steve scratched the back of his neck nervously, before looking at Eddie questioningly. \u201cI mean\u2013 Yeah, right? You\u2019re\u2026 my boyfriend?\u201d Steve asked, then winced, hiding his face in one hand and shaking his head. Not his smoothest moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d said Eddie softly. Steve slowly parted his fingers enough to look at Eddie, raising his eyebrow in intrigue. Eddie laughed at this, pride flooding Steve. Eddie gingerly wrapped his fingers around Steve\u2019s wrist, moving his hand away from his face and instead lacing their fingers together. \u201cDo you wanna be my boyfriend?\u201d </p>\n<p>Warmth exploded in Steve\u2019s chest, and he never knew a question could fill him with\u2026 so <em>much.</em> For a moment Steve didn\u2019t verbally respond, instead just giving a stunned nod, but then he realized he needed to <em>really tell</em> Eddie. Out loud. \u201cI wanna be your boyfriend,\u201d spoken quietly not because Steve wasn\u2019t proud to say it, but because it was just for them. Not even for the birds to overhear. Just him and Eddie.</p>\n<p>Eddie crashed his lips into Steve\u2019s with fervor, his hands flying to explore his neck and hair. Immediately Steve gripped at Eddie\u2019s waist, pulling him onto his lap and deepening the kiss. </p>\n<p>And in that moment, for the first time in a long time, not a single part of Steve Harrington worried about anything.</p>\n<p>Winter was finally giving way to the tender warmth of spring, the first few blooms popping up around Hawkins. Steve had spent most of his fall and winter bundled up in blankets with Eddie at his trailer, or his house on the rare occasion that his parents were out of town. He kept expecting the excitement to wash away, for something to turn sour, or even just slow the absolute <em>want</em> that Steve had for Eddie. But it hadn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>Every time Eddie looked at him, all wide-eyed and some massive, ridiculously disarming grin plastering his face, Steve felt that same wonder rush through him. He wasn\u2019t completely naive; they were young, and maybe they wouldn\u2019t last forever. But he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what if it did? </p>\n<p>And Steve didn\u2019t know when that idea stopped being an unfathomable, intimidating notion, instead turning into something he thought of with such a palpable <em>fucking want,</em> but he found himself lying awake at night thinking of what that would look like. A long life with Eddie Munson in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBabe, you know I love when you get that happy puppy-dog look in your eyes,\u201d Eddie\u2019s slightly stressed voice cut in. \u201cBut we\u2019re late to pick up our half of the ungrateful teens. And we got Henderson. So we <em>will</em> be hearing about it all day.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, god, you\u2019re right,\u201d Steve said with a halfhearted groan, starting up his car and pulling out of the trailer park. It was spring break for both Jonathan and Nancy, so they were in town, along with Argyle. Will and Nancy had been the ones to organize a game of capture the flag, and Steve thought it didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea.</p>\n<p>A part of him thought maybe, in an alternate universe where none of the bullshit with the Upside Down happened, he wouldn\u2019t find this idea fun. He was twenty-one now, and surely what should appeal to him is bar hopping with his friends, not running around playing a schoolyard game in a field with a bunch of high school sophomores.</p>\n<p>But none of them, including those that were now adults, really got to have a childhood. Hell, Steve got more of a childhood than likely any of them. So if his group of traumatized teens came to him asking to play a game of capture the flag, he was gonna play a fucking game of capture the flag. </p>\n<p>Eddie had teased him a little about being so adamant on them going. Eddie was skeptical about going purely because \u201cit sounds dangerously close to exercise.\u201d When Steve gave him the whole traumatized teen spiel, he caved pretty quickly, though. </p>\n<p>They picked up Lucas and Max first before heading for Dustin\u2019s. \u201cYou know he\u2019s gonna kill you for being late,\u201d was the first thing Lucas said as he got in the car. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the ride Steve,\u201d Steve said in a pointedly high pitched and nasally voice. \u201cFor always giving us free rides and never asking for gas money. We <em>appreciate you,</em> Steve.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like, rich,\u201d Max said flatly. \u201cWhy would we, a bunch of teenagers\u2013 and I live in a <em>trailer park</em>-- give you gas money?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve gave her a slightly apologetic look in the rearview mirror as he tried to backpedal. \u201cI-I wasn\u2019t saying that to\u2026 <em>imply</em> that you should pay me. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019,\u201d he shrugged. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, if anything you owe <em>us,</em>\u201d Lucas said, Steve\u2019s mouth falling open as he scoffed in shock. </p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot <em>fathom</em> how that\u2019s true,\u201d he stated plainly. He looked over at Eddie. \u201cYou wanna help me out here? Fighting for my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie held up his hands in surrender. \u201cHey man\u2026 I live in the same trailer park. Down with the rich,\u201d Eddie smirked. Steve shot him a glare, but there was no real malice behind it. </p>\n<p>\u201cMore like <em>going down on</em> the rich\u2013\u201d Steve muttered, but was immediately cut off by Max and Lucas exclaiming \u201cEw!\u201d in unison. Eddie swatted his arm. \u201cHey!\u201d Steve exclaimed with a laugh. \u201cIt was right there\u2013\u201d Eddie smacked his arm again, but neither were very hard, and there was a reluctant smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNasty,\u201d Lucas scolded, keeping a level disgusted glare as he added \u201cAnd that\u2019s not because I\u2019m homophobic.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s because you\u2019re like\u2026\u201d Max grimaced. \u201cOur dads.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI was <em>gonna say</em> you owe us for constantly opening Eddie\u2019s door shirtless,\u201d Lucas clarified, before gesturing in the air. \u201cYour\u2026 hairy boobies all hanging out\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Steve protested once more. \u201cI will not have my boobies slandered in my own car! That is where I draw the <em>line.</em>--\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c--But,\u201d Lucas said pointedly. \u201cYou <em>definitely</em> owe us for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve pouted, looking over at Eddie. \u201cYou like my boobies, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love your boobies,\u201d Eddie said earnestly. </p>\n<p>\u201cOwe us for that too,\u201d Max pointed in between them, lips tugging down in a frown. Lucas just shook his head, puckering his lips in distaste. </p>\n<p>They pulled up to Dustin\u2019s house not long after, Steve bracing himself for his no doubt long list of complaints. When the curly haired child slid into the backseat\u2013 surprising absolutely no one in the car\u2013 his first words were \u201cYou\u2019re late, Harrington.\u201d Steve rolled his eyes dramatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he wont stop talking about blowjobs and boobies,\u201d Lucas supplied, earning a shocked gasp from Dustin and a flat look from Steve in the rearview mirror. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve Harrington, I am <em>ashamed</em> to hear of this behavior,\u201d Dustin said, completely serious. Then he looked at Eddie. \u201cEddie, kindly keep your man on a leash.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Eddie clapped his hands together. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking him, so far it\u2019s a \u2018maybe\u2019\u2013\u201d he was cut off not only by the entire backseat yelling their protests, but Steve covering his mouth with one hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cDear god, if this is you helping please stop,\u201d Steve pleaded, sparing a glance at Eddie. Even if Steve couldn\u2019t feel the smile under his hand, which he could, he could see it in Eddie\u2019s eyes. Then, something wet pressed into Steve\u2019s palm. He yanked his hand back. \u201cDid you just <em>lick my hand</em>?\u201d He asked Eddie in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like it\u2019s\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em>begging you</em> not to finish that sentence,\u201d Max interjected, genuine desperation in her voice. </p>\n<p>Eddie held his hands up once again in surrender. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You just don\u2019t get our love.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like people should study you,\u201d Lucas said suddenly, eyes narrowing on Eddie thoughtfully. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, like to see if something\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked, glancing around a bit confused. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Lucas seemed to think about this as he said it. \u201cJust to see what\u2019s\u2026 goin\u2019 on.\u201d Eddie pursed his lips at this as if he were thinking of a response, but just shook his head and shrugged instead. </p>\n<p>They arrived at the field about twenty minutes later to see two cars already there. As Steve got out of his car, he did a double take. \u201cIs Argyle\u2026 floating?\u201d He wondered, squinting in the direction of the long haired man levitating a few feet off the ground. Had Argyle not been clearly laughing, Steve might\u2019ve panicked that Vecna had returned. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is trippy, man,\u201d Argyle commented as Steve, Eddie, and the rest of the kids walked up. El was standing a few paces in front of him, hand outstretched and face smiling. Slowly she lowered her hand, and in tandem Argyle softly landed back on the ground. </p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that tire you out?\u201d Steve asked, raising an eyebrow at El. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said simply. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhen she got her powers back, they came back a lot stronger,\u201d Will informed, sitting close to Mike on the hood of Jonathan's car. Mike\u2019s hand was not-so-inconspicuously on top of Will\u2019s behind them. </p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it gonna like, basically be cheating for whoever gets El on their team?\u201d Eddie pointed out. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>obviously,</em>\u201d Lucas said, looking pointedly at El. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna use them during the game, is she? Because that <em>would</em> be cheating, and cheating is <em>basically</em> lying.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Dustin agreed enthusiastically, pointing at El and raising his eyebrows. \u201cAnd friends don\u2019t lie, do they?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Max hummed skeptically. \u201cFriends lie sometimes. Hey, Steve,\u201d Max turned to him with an uncharacteristically sweet smile. \u201cNice shorts. They look great on you, and they definitely aren\u2019t <em>disturbingly</em> short.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve frowned, looking down at his old gym shorts from basketball. He pouted, turning to Eddie in disappointment. \u201cYou said I looked good in these shorts.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I stand by that,\u201d Eddie snaked his arm around Steve\u2019s waist, pulling him into his side. </p>\n<p>\u201cEugh,\u201d Dustin made a face. \u201cYou guys are worse than Jonathan and Nancy.\u201d The group looked over then to Nancy and Jonathan sitting in the grass, Jonathan picking up small flowers and placing them in Nancy\u2019s hair with a goofy smile. </p>\n<p>Robin appeared then and gave Dustin a light shove. \u201cShow some respect for your elders,\u201d She had her arm wrapped around Vickie\u2019s shoulders, and had just come over from where they were talking next to another car, presumably Vickie\u2019s. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, wait a minute,\u201d Argyle said, furrowing his brows. \u201cIf Vickie can drive\u2026 why\u2019d I have to ride in Jonathan\u2019s trunk?\u201d There was a pause as a few members of the group looked around at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cArgyle, you <em>volunteered</em> to ride in the trunk,\u201d Mike corrected. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Mike even offered to have me sit on his lap and you said \u2018no. I want to ride in the trunk,\u2019\u201d Will added on, Mike\u2019s face turning bright red at this information. </p>\n<p>\u201cBet that was disappointing for you, Wheeler,\u201d Steve smirked at Mike, who just made a face back. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Argyle said thoughtfully, then smiled. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCan we get started already?\u201d Dustin interjected. \u201cLosing daylight, people.\u201d At his comment, Will motioned for Jonathan and Nancy to come over. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow are we even supposed to play capture the flag here,\u201d Eddie looked around the very open field. \u201cIsn\u2019t an integral part of the game <em>hiding</em> the flag?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe play it differently,\u201d Dustin informed. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and since Steve took so long getting here,\u201d Mike gave him a pointed look. \u201cWe already set up some sticks and rocks to mark off the jails.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin, Vickie, the flags?\u201d Dustin turned to the girls. Vickie slinked away from Robin momentarily to go to her car, popping the trunk and then returning with two large sticks that had been spray painted bright orange. She handed them off to Dustin.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much is different,\u201d he began explaining as everyone gathered around. \u201cWe\u2019ll put two flags on either side of the field. Obviously, the first team to get the other flag and stick it in the ground next to their own, wins.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat pile of rocks,\u201d Will pointed to a small stack of rocks not far from them, roughly in the middle of the field. \u201cMarks the halfway point. If you cross from your side of the rocks into enemy territory, you can get tagged and taken to their jail. You only get out of jail if someone from your team can make it past enemy lines and tag you, without getting tagged themselves, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tag people if you\u2019re on the enemy\u2019s side of the rocks,\u201d Dustin continued. \u201cThe game ends when either one side has both flags, or everyone on the other team is in jail. Make sense?\u201d He looked around at everyone with raised eyebrows. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd to be extra clear, no powers, El,\u201d Lucas looked at her pointedly. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe has super cool powers and she doesn\u2019t even get to use them to win games?\u201d Vickie chimed in. \u201cKinda lame.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWait, hold on,\u201d Mike said, looking over at Vickie. \u201cWhen did you\u2026 learn about everything?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think she was awfully calm seeing a fifteen year old levitate a grown man six feet off the ground with nothing but her mind?\u201d Robin raised her eyebrows at Mike. \u201cI told her a while ago, obviously.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you believed her?\u201d Jonathan asked Vickie. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt actually made a lot more sense than the excuses she would come up with every time she accidentally mentioned something,\u201d Vickie said simply. \u201cRobin is pretty terrible at lying.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, how do we pick teams?\u201d Nancy cut in, looking around at the group. \u201cDon\u2019t we have an odd number of people.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Dustin said with a smile. \u201cCouples go against each other, and in the event that El <em>does</em> cheat,\u201d he gave her a warning glare, which she seemed to find amusing. \u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t have El on their team gets Argyle.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, why do the couples gotta split up?\u201d Mike protested. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t there will be like, three people playing, Mike,\u201d Dustin said flatly. \u201cI, unfortunately, know what all of you are like.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just bitter because you can only talk to your girlfriend over a radio,\u201d Lucas drawled, giving Dustin a disapproving look. </p>\n<p>\u201cSuzie and I\u2019s love knows no bounds and transcends time and space, Lucas,\u201d He retorted matter-of-factly. \u201cSo, no. It\u2019s not that. I just want to actually play the game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen for the love of god let\u2019s play it,\u201d Steve groaned, growing impatient. </p>\n<p>\u201cCouples: half of you go over there, the other half over there,\u201d Dustin gestured to either side of the rock pile. \u201cEl, Argyle and I will just choose sides.\u201d </p>\n<p>The group began to split off. Steve gave Eddie a confident smirk, keeping his face close to his as he spoke in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 down, Munson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie gave a show of thoughtfulness. \u201cNope. Think that\u2019s later in the evening,\u201d he grinned before leaning in and giving Steve a long kiss. <em>Never gets old,</em> Steve thought. When they separated and Steve began walking away, Eddie smacked his ass. Steve grinned over his shoulder before joining Jonathan, Argyle, Mike, Robin, Max, and Dustin. </p>\n<p>The teams had a few minutes to strategize, Steve\u2019s team deciding to go for a baiting technique. They would all get some distance from their flag, which Dustin had stuck into the ground, but Steve and Max would linger nearby, since they were the fastest. The idea was this would prompt someone from the other team to make a break for their flag, but Steve and Max would be anticipating this, able to flank and tag them easily. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if all you pot-smokers feel your lungs collapsing,\u201d Dustin stated animatedly, giving Argyle, Jonathan, and Steve pointed looks. \u201cIf that flag is at risk you don\u2019t stop running until you\u2019re unconscious.\u201d Steve shared a concerned look with Jonathan. He wondered if Henderson\u2019s intensity would ever die down, but so far it\u2019s only proven to ramp up with age. He feared for what the little monster was gonna be like in his early twenties. \u201cAm I clear?\u201d </p>\n<p>The group gave timid nods, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Dustin. \u201cAM I CLEAR?!\u201d He bellowed, making Argyle and Max jolt in surprise. </p>\n<p>\u201cSir yes sir!\u201d Argyle yelled back, standing stock straight and saluting like Dustin was his captain. </p>\n<p>\u201cBreak!\u201d Dustin initiated the group\u2019s dismissal, all of them taking their positions and leaving a few clear paths to the flag. Steve and Max were both sure to be within sprinting distance, however. </p>\n<p>Once the other team was spread out in their own formation, Dustin began the count down, and then the game was on. </p>\n<p>And just as anticipated, El and Lucas were making a break to the path closest to Max. Jonathan managed to get El but Lucas slipped past, juking out Argyle in the process. Steve got ready to intercept, but Max was on route to cut Lucas off. Lucas, likely realizing he was his team\u2019s fastest player and about to get jailed in the first few minutes of the game, pivoted and ran back to his side of the rocks.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mike was trying to taunt the other team by waiting just over the line of enemy territory, easily able to step back into the safe zone. It was enough to distract Vickie and Nancy while Robin made a break for it around them. She didn\u2019t get far, however, before Will tagged her and brought her over to their jail. So far, things were still looking better for Steve\u2019s team. </p>\n<p>The game continued on for a while without anyone getting tagged, but no one managed to steal a flag successfully. Surprisingly, Argyle had gotten the other team\u2019s stick out of the ground, but was quickly tagged on his way back. Then, Max slammed into Lucas on his second attempt at the flag. This was pretty big in their favor, but was quickly countered by losing Jonathan on his failed jailbreak. Since they had Argyle, this still left them with an equal amount of free players. It was anyone\u2019s game. </p>\n<p>\u201cScared, Munson?\u201d Steve called, staring down Eddie who hadn\u2019t crossed enemy lines once.</p>\n<p>\u201cI prefer \u2018strategic!\u2019\u201d He yelled back, earning a laugh from Steve. </p>\n<p>\u201cWill you stop flirting and make a move?\u201d Dustin chimed in, his comment directed mostly at Eddie. </p>\n<p>\u201cPatience, Henderson!\u201d Eddie retorted. </p>\n<p>Mike let out a groan when no one had moved from their side in a while. \u201cI can\u2019t take this. I\u2019m abandoning the plan!\u201d He hollered before bolting in a straight line for the other team\u2019s flag. </p>\n<p>\u201cSerpentine, Mike! Serpentine!\u201d Dustin yelled feverishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not getting shot at!\u201d Steve commented, but the boy had already started zigging and zagging, which slowed him down just enough for Will to knock him down. Steve had never seen someone hesitantly tackle someone else, but that was the only way to describe Will\u2019s movements. And just like that, Mike was jailed and the other team had the upper hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going for it!\u201d Vickie screamed as she started sprinting to the outskirts of Steve\u2019s side, where cover was bare. Steve, Max, and Dustin scrambled to her, and Max was just able to tag her before she reached the stick. But not before Nancy, who had managed to slip by in the chaos, jailbroke Lucas and El.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Dustin cried as the other team fled to the safety of their side. </p>\n<p>\u201cAt least we still got Vickie,\u201d Steve offered, Max walking her over to the jail. Dustin shot him a glare, and he took that as his cue to spread out. </p>\n<p>And in the commotion, Steve almost missed a mop of brown hair sprinting down the left side. Almost.</p>\n<p>There was nothing hesitant in the way Steve tackled Eddie, his arms wrapping around his middle as their bodies collided, slamming them both down onto the ground. Both of them groaned, Steve moving slowly as he pushed himself up onto his hands, hovering over Eddie. The impact had been a lot harder than he intended, but Eddie was laughing up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Steve smirked down at him, their legs entangled and Steve\u2019s hands bracketing Eddie\u2019s face on the ground. </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s hands were resting on Steve\u2019s sides, sliding ever-so-slowly under his shirt. \u201cOh no,\u201d Eddie said with no real regret in his voice. \u201cWhat a shame. Steve Harrington is pinning me down in the tiniest pair of shorts I\u2019ve ever seen. How will I go on?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he attempted to defend himself. \u201cThey\u2019re not even that short.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty short, Stevie,\u201d Eddie grinned. \u201cWhy do you think I wanted you to wear them so badly?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI just thought you wanted me to be able to move as fast as possible,\u201d Steve smirked. </p>\n<p>\u201cHARRINGTON!\u201d Dustin yelled, and a look up showed him running in hot pursuit of El, who was very much outrunning him with their flag in hand. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d Steve watched as El bobbed and weaved out of Max\u2019s reach. </p>\n<p>In an array of cheers from her team, and boos from Mike and Dustin, El made it back to her side, proudly sticking the make-shift flag next to their own. Dustin threw his hat on the ground, shaking his head with his hands on his hips. Steve and Eddie couldn\u2019t help but laugh at this sight, but they were sure to hide it, Steve behind his hand and Eddie by burying his face into Steve\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>Dustin turned to them, marching over with a vendetta in his eyes. Steve hurriedly shushed Eddie as the child approached, looming over them. \u201cYou will rue this day, Steve Harrington. Prepare to never forget this until the day you die.\u201d With that, he stalked off to where the rest of the group had loosely gathered, El\u2019s teammates congratulating her. </p>\n<p>Steve and Eddie shared a look before bursting into laughter, Steve letting his head fall onto Eddie\u2019s chest as he regained his composure. \u201cThink he just made us his mortal enemies.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Us?</em>\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyes bulged with a laugh. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDistracted me, obviously,\u201d Steve supplied, dipping down and pressing their lips together. When he pulled back he bit his lip, just taking a moment to observe Eddie. His long hair haloed out around him in the grass, golden sunlight making his eyes shine in a way that illuminated all the different shades of brown. Like honey and whiskey. </p>\n<p>It was moments like these when those thoughts of a life with Eddie would relentlessly flood Steve\u2019s mind. Not only staying with Eddie, but going to bed with him every night and waking up next to him every day. Maybe they\u2019d get a small place together in California. Maybe even get a dog. And maybe they\u2019d host the kids and their friends every holiday, never having anywhere near enough beds but not caring in the slightest how crowded their house would become. Learning how to make eggs a million different ways just so Eddie never got bored of having breakfast with him. Sharing coffee on their porch, Eddie tucked tightly into his side where Steve knew he\u2019d be safe.</p>\n<p>Just Steve and Eddie existing together. Every day for as long as he\u2019d have him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 at me like that again,\u201d Eddie pointed out, not tearing his own curious gaze away from Steve. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that pretty head of yours?\u201d</p>\n<p> Steve smiled fondly. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>A long life with Eddie Munson in it,</em> Steve thought. <em>That\u2019s not so bad.</em></p>"
