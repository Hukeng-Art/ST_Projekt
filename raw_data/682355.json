  "text": "<p>The longer Derek stared at the letter in hand, the more he desperately wished that he was dreaming. However, Derek was pretty sure his subconscious couldn\u2019t create the intricate coils and symbols that made up the crest of the Turner pack, nor would it be so cruel as to torture him with the words within the letter. Dread and horror settled heavier and heavier in his gut with every sentence that his eyes glossed over. He hadn\u2019t actually thought they\u2019d follow through with their claims of enacting an old treaty betrothal between the Hale and Turner pack that had been drawn up years ago, especially since he was well over the age of eighteen by now.</p>\n<p>This was over his head. Even six years of being the alpha hadn\u2019t prepared him to deal with pack politics that nobody had ever really taught him about. Derek had been taking a shot in the dark when he\u2019d responded to their initial letter (found in an old P.O. box Laura had set up a dozen years ago after the fire) stating that their delay in calling upon the treaty had rendered it void. He\u2019d even been sure to mention having already found a significant other--one that happened to not actually exist--so that they might change their minds. Derek had really been hoping they wouldn\u2019t call his bluff\u2026but all his hopes had been in vain. </p>\n<p>Not only had they called his bluff, but according to the letter, Derek had less than a week to find himself a fianc\u00e9 because the Turner pack was coming down to \u2018officially\u2019 break the treaty and give Derek and his nonexistent mate their blessing. Derek knew for a fact that turning them down could probably end in a lot of hell and maybe even bloodshed if they discovered that Derek had been lying to them.</p>\n<p>He knew for a fact that they were desperate for a born werewolf to help strengthen the pack\u2019s future bloodlines. </p>\n<p>Derek grabbed his cell phone from the coffee table and hit Scott\u2019s speed dial number. He wasn\u2019t sure Scott was going to be able to help--but Derek had learned after a good handful of years that keeping something like this to himself was a far worse decision than actually calling Scott for help.</p>\n<p>When the call went straight to voice mail, Derek sighed, hung up, and called Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cMornin\u2019, Starshine,\u201d Stiles chirped when he answered, \u201cScott not answer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek muttered, smiling a little at the grumble he got from the other end, \u201ccan you get in contact with him? I need everyone here as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles let out a nervous hissing noise as he sighed through his teeth, \u201cis this an emergency?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Judging from the thudding on the other line, Stiles had probably dropped something onto his desk in a fit of exasperated dramatics. \u201cDefine \u2018will be\u2019,\u201d he snapped, \u201cbecause the last time you said that, Erica\u2019s hair got set on fire and I needed three new tires for the jeep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wasn\u2019t going to take the bait this time--because Stiles loved baiting him and Derek maybe had a terrible habit of letting Stiles get his way sometimes. If this were any less serious, Derek was pretty sure they\u2019d be bickering about the schematics on who was to blame for the destruction of the jeep\u2019s tires and Erica\u2019s goldilock curls.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much is there about arranged marriages in that book you got from Deaton?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles released a strangled garble of noises that usually meant he was in the process of reacting to whatever question had been thrown his way. It took a second, but Derek soon heard the shifting of paper as Stiles started to flip through the book. \u201cUh,\u201d Stiles grunted, muttering to himself for a second and then going silent to blurt, \u201cwait, are you engaged?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Derek admitted wearily. </p>\n<p>Another, longer silence happened, and then Stiles let out a dramatic and pained sigh of the greatest suffering. \u201cI\u2019ll get the pack together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even if Derek was going to entertain the thought of thanking Stiles, it was pointless because he hung up right after he\u2019d finished talking. Derek and the other werewolves weren\u2019t the only ones who had changed and matured over the years. Stiles had gotten the brunt of a lot of their issues, and it made him tougher and sharper than the sixteen year old kid Derek had met in the woods so long ago. </p>\n<p>It came with a price, though, and no matter how many times Stiles claimed that his injuries were worth it, Derek still felt miserable on the few times that Stiles walked a little slower or spaced out more than usual. Despite the bad days, Stiles was resilient, adaptable, and the most stubborn and irreplaceable human that Derek had met in his entire life. </p>\n<p>Derek looked around his apartment, realizing with a pang of sorrow that he was going to have to clean before the pack showed up. Everyone had been busy for most of the week, which meant that Derek had kind of let things get out of hand with no one to impress. He started with the living room, grabbing a trash bag and getting to work. </p>\n<p>Stiles let himself in while Derek was pulling his first load of clothes out of the dryer. He was one of the few pack members with a key--other than Isaac and Scott--and was always happy to use his key even when he knew Derek was home. Derek popped his head out of the tiny laundry room, calling out so Stiles could figure out where he was.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d was the first thing Stiles asked, grinning crookedly. Derek grunted, lifting up the basket and gesturing for the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you like folding socks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles brought his cane up, giving Derek half a second to see the runes carved into the dark oak before he poked Derek harshly in the stomach, \u201csince you decided to let me call everyone instead of doing it yourself, nobody is going to be here for another hour.\u201d Derek cringed, feeling the sharp flare of pressure that came with that particular protection symbol.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey listen to you,\u201d Derek pointed out, \u201cyou\u2019re more annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wielded his cane, shaking it menacingly, \u201cwatch it, buddy,\u201d he warned, but with no actual malice in his words.</p>\n<p>They sat on the couch, Derek pressing up against Stiles\u2019 right side and making sure that his thigh was touching Stiles\u2019 bad leg as he started to pull clothes out of the basket. Stiles was loathe to admit, but having werewolves who could ease his pain a little always put him in a better mood. It had been overcast since the night before, which meant that Derek was sure Stiles\u2019 leg was bothering him more than usual. </p>\n<p>Derek put up with the dull throb in his leg that came from taking some of Stiles\u2019 pain while they folded his laundry in silence. It was one of the many ways Derek had learned to show his gratitude for all the hell that Stiles had gone through for the pack. Stiles was having one of those days where he wasn\u2019t particularly talkative either, his fingers nimble as he paired off sock after sock and hummed an old rock song under his breath. </p>\n<p>By the time everyone finally showed up, the entire apartment was starting to feel cramped. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo wait,\u201d Scott threw a hand out, looking just as confused as everyone else after Derek\u2018s explanation, \u201care you engaged or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was,\u201d Derek tried again, \u201cbefore my family died, I was supposed to marry the daughter of the alpha when I turned eighteen. After the fire, Laura and I moved away and the Turner pack lost contact with us\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pressed his fingertips together, and then brought them to his temples to rub absently. \u201cThe terms of engagement were for a born werewolf from the Hale pack of Beacon Hills. Two werewolves isn\u2019t a pack\u2026not one that\u2019s worth marrying into.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles crossed his arms, bouncing his leg in his usual fidget. \u201cSo, what? Now that you\u2019ve got this big bad pack, they think they can just be like, \u2018oh hey by the way you were supposed to marry our daughter ten years ago,\u2019 and think it will work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugged, \u201cpretty much. Only now I\u2019m the alpha, and there\u2019s enough of us that we could double the strength of their pack if they married us in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUs?\u201d Scott echoed, \u201cwhat do we have to do with it? Do you mean if you marry this chick that we have to join their pack?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles piped up, \u201cthat\u2019s lame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why tell them you\u2019re already engaged?\u201d Boyd asked from where he was lounging in the recliner. \u201cIs it some kind of loophole?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scrubbed at his face, shrugging and trying to ignore the urge to cry in frustration. \u201cThey waited ten years to enact the betrothal. By right, if I\u2019m married or going to be married in that time, the treaty is void. The problem is that now they want to come here to meet my mate and bless the marriage and <i>I have no way of stopping them.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re engaged?\u201d Stiles blurted, staring at Derek like he\u2019d eaten the very last curly fry on earth. Derek stared in disbelief and Scott let out a loud noise of understanding.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you lied!\u201d he exclaimed, face splitting into a knowing grin while Stiles made a few expressions before settling on a sheepish shrug. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Stiles asked, gesturing to the pack as a whole, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure none of us really want to join these guys if they\u2019re as power-hungry as you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac dug his hands into his pockets, \u201cwe could hire someone? Maybe get an escort to be his fianc\u00e9?\u201d Boyd twisted his head, giving Isaac the same blank-faced stare that he\u2019d somehow learned from Derek. Isaac ducked his head, \u201cright, bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Danny?\u201d Scott suggested. Derek shook his head, temporarily relieved that Jackson and Lydia were out of state for their anniversary so he didn\u2019t have to hear the two of them reprimanding Scott for volunteering their best friend to fake-marry Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t smell like pack,\u201d Derek said, \u201cjust a friend of the pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could do it?\u201d Isaac shrugged, gnawing on the corner of his lip. </p>\n<p>Derek thought about it, but the idea of being intimate with Isaac made something churn in his gut. \u201cWouldn\u2019t work. We interact too much like alpha and beta\u2026 they\u2019d be able to tell,\u201d he explained, getting nothing but looks of confusion from Isaac and Scott. \u201cWe have to pass as lovers, which means you need to be my equal; and you take orders too easily.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac nodded slowly, making a sound of understanding just as Allison and Erica slipped into the apartment after having run to the store to grab a few things to make for dinner. </p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Derek added, watching Erica plop herself in Boyd\u2019s lap, \u201cyou smell like\u2026\u201d he gestured vaguely, hand waving over to Scott and then to Allison--because it didn\u2019t take a genius to tell that the three of them had been experimenting for the past couple of months. There hadn\u2019t been a reason to bring it up before now, and Derek almost regretted it as Stiles\u2019 mouth dropped open and he gaped at Scott--who was red in the face and avoiding eye contact.</p>\n<p>Isaac, however, just nodded understandingly, \u201cfair enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somehow, everyone but Derek turned to look at Stiles at the exact same time. Derek, however, was trying to desperately ignore what was about to happen. He had not spent the past few years ignoring how hard he had fallen for Stiles, just to be forced to pretend they were in the relationship he\u2019d always wanted. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo they have to be a werewolf?\u201d Stiles asked, and Derek barely stopped himself from wincing when he added, \u201cI could be your boyfr--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFianc\u00e9,\u201d Derek interrupted. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grimacing, Derek brought a hand up to his face, mouthing the word, \u2018fuck,\u2019 into his palm so that no one could see it. This was going to end badly, there was no way it couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Stiles huffed, \u201cdon\u2019t look so offended. I\u2019m a <i>catch.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek knew that tone of voice well. It was the same indignant pitch that Stiles always took on when he was ready to put up a fight if he didn\u2019t get his way. Stiles had a habit of stubbornly doing things just for the sake of proving others wrong. \u201cYou have to smell more like me,\u201d he said, hoping that would be enough to change Stiles\u2019 mind once he realized what type of interaction this sort of \u2018job\u2019 would entail.</p>\n<p>A scoff, \u201cnot that hard. I\u2019m a cuddler anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have less than a week. How are you going to explain to your dad where you are? You need to make my apartment smell like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stared and then, very slowly, said, \u201cthis isn\u2019t high school,\u201d because of course Derek couldn\u2019t use Stiles\u2019 father as an excuse anymore. The man had known about the pack for three and a half years already. Nope. Stiles had already sunk his claws in. There was no way he was going to back out now. Derek was screwed. </p>\n<p>He must have been staring too long because Stiles clapped a hand on his good leg and grinned, \u201cwell that\u2019s that, then. Anyone hungry?\u201d he asked, pushing himself up into a stand, snatching his cane from the coffee table and heading for the kitchen. Derek got up, turning in time to see Stiles suddenly put his cane down and start to use it after he\u2019d only gotten a few feet from the living room. </p>\n<p>Everyone else resettled in the living room to discuss their weeks while Derek helped Stiles rummage around for the necessary utensils needed to make pasta. Other than needing to use the cane to get to the kitchen, Stiles seemed like he was doing better than earlier. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf we do this, you need to be on your guard,\u201d Derek warned, pulling out the pre-made sauce jars out of the grocery bags that Allison had left on the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re human, and that means that they\u2019re going to be pretty pissed when they find out they lost an alpha to what they think is a weaker race.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grinning and setting down the saucepan on the stove, Stiles turned and gave Derek\u2019s shoulder a firm pat and then squeeze, \u201cthe cane isn\u2019t just for the gimp leg, remember?\u201d he teased. Derek frowned, and Stiles made a move to poke him with the rune-etched end that had Derek jerking away out of instinct.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee? I can be scary,\u201c smugly, Stiles set the cane against the counter and went about filling a pot with water. Derek would have been more inclined to believe him, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he didn\u2019t know the Turners well enough to trust them not to do something that could end up with Stiles getting hurt or killed. He grabbed some basil and salt, sprinkling them into the pot when Stiles set it on the stove.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should probably stay tonight,\u201d he said, \u201cI still have some of your stuff from the wendigo last month; I washed them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHow sweet of you,\u201d Stiles said dryly, grabbing the half-empty bag of garlic knots from on top of Derek\u2019s toaster oven. Derek harrumphed, watching Stiles set a few on a pan so they could be heated up once the food was nearly finished.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he sniped, filching one of the rolls and ducking Stiles\u2019 karate-chop flail before escaping to the living room. </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>After the food had been completely destroyed by hungry werewolves and college students alike, everyone went their separate ways. Derek made sure before they left that they had all finished smoothing out their stories (which was really just a romantic version of how Derek and Stiles had actually met) for when the Turners arrived--as well as Derek telling them what he knew about this pack; which wasn\u2019t much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles flopped back against the couch, rubbing his stomach with a contented sigh, his good leg settling on the arm of the couch. Derek watched from the kitchen as Stiles reached for his bad leg, hauling it up onto the arm with a grunt. He went back to cleaning up the mess from dinner while Stiles used his cane to drag the controller for the play station within reach. Derek was just rinsing out the saucepan when Stiles\u2019 voice drifted from the living room.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, can you turn the TV on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have feet.\u201d Derek shot back.</p>\n<p>Stiles released a long, dramatic whine and then, \u201cbut you\u2019re my fiance! You have to provide for me!\u201d in a way that was so exaggerated Derek actually felt a little better about the entire arrangement. It meant that Stiles was going to treat this just like every other awkward situation they\u2019d ever been forced into; with humor, and the best effort he could muster. </p>\n<p>Drying his hands off with a paper towel, Derek left the dishes to be done later and wandered into the living room. Stiles was waving his cane around, trying to reach the remote on the recliner without falling. It was almost comical, but Derek knew no matter how much Stiles might have been playing it up, his leg was probably still bothering him. </p>\n<p>No matter how fast a human healed, Stiles was never happy. He\u2019d keep pushing himself until things like this happened--where he\u2019d rather ask for help than deal with the pain and aches that came from moving around. Derek grabbed the remote, flicking on the television and then heading for the couch. He lifted up both of Stiles\u2019 legs, sitting down and settling them onto his lap. </p>\n<p>Stiles spent less than a second looking at Derek oddly before he shrugged and said, \u201cif we\u2019re gonna go all domestic, you should rub my feet. You know, for practice purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek had a hard time finding an argument to that when he had spent years looking for a hundred reasons to touch Stiles. It was hard to find any reason not to comply when Derek also knew for a fact that Stiles\u2019 feet were almost always bothering him because of the way his injury forced him to walk. He fiddled with Stiles\u2019 sneakers, pulling the laces loose and then tugging both of them off. </p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Stiles gaped. Derek shrugged, grabbing his bad leg\u2019s foot, and dug his thumbs right into the sole, pushing upward at the tense, sensitive muscles there. Stiles let out a choked warble of, \u201coh God,\u201d head thudding back against the couch and his toes spasming. Derek snorted, massaging firmly in slow, outward circles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, forget buying me seat covers or something as payment\u2026 just add foot rubs to each pack meeting,\u201c Stiles whimpered, his foot arching just the tiniest bit when Derek hit a sensitive area, \u201cmaybe twice on Mondays.\u201c </p>\n<p>Derek cracked a grin, a swell of fondness overwhelming him suddenly. When Stiles had been in high school, they didn\u2019t have this familiarity. Derek had been so alone back then; relying on a barely-there bond between himself and a bunch of teenagers, and in a constant state of waiting for something to kill him. He wasn\u2019t really sure what he\u2019d done right between then and now, but whatever it was that had kept everyone together, Derek was grateful for it. He was grateful to have such a closeness with Stiles--even if it was under somewhat false pretenses-- that they could joke around and Derek was able to touch him freely while leaving all awkwardness behind.</p>\n<p> If there was one thing he\u2019d missed about his family, it was the open affection between all of them. It had taken Derek a long time to get that with this new pack--two years before Erica would curl up next to the couch, four years until Boyd would pull him into a greeting hug, and five before he could reach out and hold Stiles without worrying about the repercussions. </p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long before Stiles was a sufficient pile of goo on the couch, the controller hanging limply in his hand while Derek rubbed at his ankles. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you do your stretches?\u201d he asked. Stiles cracked an eye open, glowering at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI kind of have to if I don\u2019t want to be crippled for the rest of my life,\u201d his tone was sharp and bitter, full of frustration that Derek knew he had trouble expressing. Derek shrugged once, because--in all honesty--he had no idea how human injuries healed. The only reason he knew so much about Stiles\u2019 was because each trip he made to the hospital was met with Melissa McCall\u2019s wrath and a folder full of printouts on whatever treatment required. </p>\n<p>Derek placed his hand behind the knee of Stiles\u2019 bad leg, pushing up and bending his leg towards his stomach. Stiles let out a loud, pained whimper, his face scrunching up.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Derek reminded him, ignoring the dirty look Stiles shot his way. Stiles\u2019 leg shook in his palms, but Derek kept gently pushing until Stiles let out a long, shuddering breath, finally relaxing enough that Derek could push just a few inches more. This wasn\u2019t the first time Stiles had needed help with his physical therapy--there were days near the beginning where it had taken almost the entire pack to even get him out of bed.</p>\n<p>Counting in his head, Derek finally lowered Stiles\u2019 leg after a good minute, watching as Stiles went utterly limp again. \u201cDo you need help getting up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles sighed, pushing himself up, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I could run for a mile right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek narrowed his eyes as Stiles laughed and stood up, stretching and groaning. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Derek mocked, \u201cyou\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that was one time,\u201d Stiles sniped, standing before Derek, bouncing a little and wiggling his arms and legs to work out the kinks he\u2019d gotten while laying down. He was moving better, knees bending together and his hips rotating the way they should have been. It made Derek feel a little better knowing that he was repaying Stiles in some way for all the things he\u2019d gone through for the pack. </p>\n<p>Standing, Derek reached out to scrub a hand over Stiles\u2019 head and give it a gentle shove, \u201cgo take a shower, you\u2019re going to have to sleep with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Stiles hummed, punching Derek gently in the chest in retaliation for the noogie. Derek was grateful for small favors like Stiles being smart enough to catch onto why they needed to share the bed. This entire situation was awkward enough, but at least he didn\u2019t have to go on a massive explanation about scent marking and pack territory.</p>\n<p>While Stiles showered, Derek hurried into his room to kick the last of his dirty laundry under the bed with some of the random nick nacks that he\u2019d never put back on the shelves. He changed the sheets with a fresh pair out of his closet and threw all his trash away, carrying out some dirty cups and dishes. He was putting them in the sink just as Stiles emerged from the hallway bathroom in a burst of steam, wearing only his boxers and the spare t-shirt that Derek had gotten out for him.</p>\n<p>By the time Derek had showered and put on some sweatpants, Stiles was fast asleep on his bed with his mouth hanging open and his arms starfished across the mattress. Derek rolled him onto his side, pushing Stiles closer to the wall and then climbing in next to him so they were back to back. He drifted off to the sound of Stiles\u2019 heavy breathing and the creaking of the overhead fan.</p>\n<p>He woke up the next morning with his head on Stiles\u2019 shoulder and Stiles\u2019 snores softly filling the room. Stiles hadn\u2019t always snored, but a cracked rib that punctured his lung back in his senior year had changed things. Derek sat up, eyes dragging down to the scar on Stiles\u2019 hip that stretched all the way around from his navel. </p>\n<p>The scar itself wasn\u2019t anything gruesome; less than an inch thick and a puckered pink that deepened to red around the soft flesh of Stiles\u2019 belly. It was what had caused the scar that made Derek\u2019s chest ache with the memory. Stiles had shoved Boyd out of the way, saving him from the manticore\u2019s sting and getting enough of the poisoned tip that he\u2019d been left in a feverish state of near-death hallucination for days afterwards. </p>\n<p>Derek pressed his palm against the center of the scar--where the barb had sunken the deepest--and applied just enough pressure that he could absorb the dull throb of pain he knew would be plaguing Stiles\u2019 joints. It wasn\u2019t the most prominent of his injuries, but the poison had damaged his nerves, leaving part of his side numb and the rest of it prone to aching first thing in the morning. </p>\n<p>Stiles\u2018 breathing changed from sleeping to waking, one eye slitting open to peer down at Derek\u2018s palm on his side. He made a tired snuffling sound, muttering, \u201cdon\u2019t think that was part of the agreement,\u201d but not doing anything to stop Derek. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust a bonus,\u201d Derek pointed out, sitting for a moment longer before he pulled his hand away to climb out of bed. He headed into the kitchen, puttering around for the things needed to make the both of them some breakfast. Stiles appeared a minute later, sitting at the kitchen bar and laying out a piece of blank paper. </p>\n<p>\u201cList time,\u201d he announced, clicking his pen dutifully, \u201cso what bases do we need to cover before your bride-not-to-be gets here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek cracked an egg into the pan he\u2019d set on the stove, grabbing up the spatula to break the yolk. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to smell like mates, I need you to be near me all the time. Werewolf mates--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, why are they called mates?\u201d Stiles interrupted. Derek paused from where he\u2019d been throwing some seasoning onto the egg and frowned. He\u2019d never really thought about <i>why</i> they used the term mates, other than the fact that it was just something his family had always done.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles made an unimpressed sound in the back of his throat, pursing his lips in a frown and bobbing his head, \u201calrighty then. So let\u2019s just stick to boyfriends\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flipped the egg over, \u201cthis is a little more serious than boyfriends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHusbands? Lovers? Betrothed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are those any better?\u201d Derek asked dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell they don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to beat me over the head with a rock and drag me back to your man cave and have your wolfy way with me,\u201d Stiles pointed out, clicking his pen dramatically with the words, \u2018wolfy way\u2019. </p>\n<p>Looking over his shoulder at Stiles, Derek made sure to raise one eyebrow slowly. It was a lot easier than telling Stiles all the ways he was utterly ridiculous, at least. </p>\n<p>Stiles shrugged, eyebrows bobbing, and he slouched in his seat to scribble an angry penguin in the corner of his paper. \u201cSo, let\u2019s just stick with fiance, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Derek muttered, feeling just the tiniest bit miffed. His parents had always called one another their mates, but it made sense that the term was a little too clich\u00e9d for Stiles\u2019 taste. The more he thought about it, the less inclined Derek was to use it. \u201cSo do you want me to just list the stuff we should do before the Turner pack gets here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek slid the egg onto a slice of toast, tossing some cheese on it and adding a swipe of mayo to another slice of toast. He cracked a second egg onto the pan, heading for the coffee maker to pour himself and Stiles\u2019 a cup now that it was done brewing. Stiles hadn\u2019t always needed lists, not in the very beginning. Now, though, with all the head injuries Stiles had sustained over the years and times their plans had gone entirely fubar, a list was pretty much mandatory.</p>\n<p>\u201cTouching,\u201d Derek muttered, \u201ca lot of it. It has to be natural, what couples do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCuddling? That, I can do.\u201d Stiles scribbled it down, nodding to himself.</p>\n<p> Derek made a face, sticking the finished egg sandwich in the microwave to keep it out of the way. He handed Stiles his coffee--now with a dash of vanilla creamer. \u201cKissing; we can\u2019t just wait until they get here. I\u2019ve never kissed you before--I have no idea how you kiss and they\u2019d be able to see that right away,\u201d it didn\u2019t help that Derek <i>wanted</i> to kiss Stiles. It was going to be torture to have him and not be with him. Derek was willing to deal with it, though, because this was for the pack just as much as it was for himself. </p>\n<p>Stiles frowned, sipping his coffee and clicking his pen, \u201clike, French kissing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Derek panicked, because he actually had no clue, \u201care we going to use tongue in front of the Turner pack?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, straight up puritan style, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snorting, Derek flipped his egg over, adding some extra pepper. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll buy the puritan lifestyle of abstinence until marriage, though,\u201d he pointed out, stomach rolling with the realization that he and Stiles would have to, at some point, be sexual enough that the scent lingered heavily on their skin when the Turners showed up. </p>\n<p>\u201cSpunk exchange?\u201d Stiles blurted disbelievingly, \u201cyou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Twisting around, Derek grabbed his coffee mug and quirked an eyebrow. Stiles groaned loudly, which was only a little hurtful to Derek\u2019s self esteem, and wrote it down on the list. </p>\n<p>\u201cSharing beds, check,\u201d Stiles muttered, \u201cshould we do laundry together? That sounds pretty domestic-y.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Derek agreed, putting his egg onto some toast and warming up the one in the microwave for Stiles for a few seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it. The biggest issue is making sure we\u2019re used to being together enough that it seems natural when the Turner pack gets here,\u201d he explained, setting Stiles\u2019 plate down in front of him and grabbing his coffee.</p>\n<p>Stiles put his pen down, \u201cokay, let\u2019s get this over with. Come here, clam lips.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek froze, halfway to sitting down next to Stiles, and stared. </p>\n<p>Gesturing for Derek to come in close, Stiles grinned in amusement, \u201cwell you\u2019re not gonna open them for just anyone, are you?\u201d Stiles puckered his lips, making loud, exaggerated kissing noises. Despite his joking, Derek could hear the way Stiles\u2019 heart sped up. It didn\u2018t take a genius to realize that he was nervous. Stiles hadn\u2019t really had many successful relationships and it was likely that he had little to no experience with kissing.</p>\n<p>Even though this entire relationship was supposed to be fake, Derek decided that their first kiss would be one that neither of them would forget. Maybe in a few years, when Stiles met the love of his life, they\u2019d have to live up to Derek\u2019s skill. Setting his mug down, and feeling desperate to make this work--to make some sort of lasting impression--Derek cupped Stiles\u2019 face. Stiles\u2019 breath hitched, heart pounding as Derek leaned in. He didn\u2019t just kiss Stiles; he ducked forward, nipping at Stiles\u2019 bottom lip and then pressing their mouths together slow and firm.</p>\n<p>The sound of Stiles\u2019 pen clattering to the counter was enough encouragement for Derek to shuffle closer. He dragged one hand across the back of Stiles\u2019 head, fingers rubbing the scar at the base of his scalp, tracing where it had been stitched up after a witch had hit him with her staff. Stiles was shadowing the movement of Derek\u2019s lips, breath coming in stuttered, sharp pants through his nose. </p>\n<p>It drove Derek wild, made him want to try harder, to make Stiles love this so much that he\u2019d never kiss anyone else without thinking of Derek first. It was selfish and Derek didn\u2019t care because this felt like the most important thing in the world to him in that moment. </p>\n<p>Stiles was gasping by the time Derek finally mustered the self control to pull back. A single glance down at Stiles\u2019 dazed face had him swooping in and kissing at the red, wet corner of Stiles\u2019 mouth with a lingering press of lips. This time, Derek pulled away completely, bringing his mug up to sip at it idly--trying to hide the way his heart was thundering in his chest and his skin felt like it was on fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cOo-okay,\u201d Stiles breathed, licking his lips and turning back to his paper, \u201cso\u2026uh,\u201d he swallowed, \u201cwow. I can say we really nailed that part of the list,\u201d his voice cracked at the end and Stiles quickly cleared his throat. Derek couldn\u2019t help the smug feeling from rising up inside of him, hiding his grin behind the rim of his coffee mug.</p>\n<p>\u201cif we\u2019re going to make it realistic when the pack comes, might as well start now,\u201d he pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles stared down at the paper, finger hovering over his hasty scrawl of \u2018spunk exchange\u2019. Derek knew his imagination was going wild, and he couldn\u2019t help but tease Stiles just the tiniest bit. Standing, Derek rested his hand on the back of Stiles\u2019 neck, squeezing firmly and then heading into the kitchen to refill his coffee. </p>\n<p>While they ate, Stiles started up a game of Twenty Questions with the intention of having them learn stupid, useless information about one another that they didn\u2019t already know. By the time Derek had finished his sandwich, he was pretty sure he was in love with Stiles even more now that he knew Stiles hated left-hand turns and that his favorite animal was some extinct form of dog that could \u2018unhinge it\u2019s jaws like a snake, dude. That\u2019s insane!\u2019. It was the little things; the quirks that had never really found a chance to come out in regular conversation before. </p>\n<p>When Derek reached for Stiles\u2019 plate to bring it into the kitchen, Stiles\u2019 hand shot out like a flash of lightening. Derek barely had a second to react before he was being dragged in and the corner of his mouth kissed. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, honeybun,\u201d Stiles chirped, looking rather pleased with himself for having taken Derek by surprise. </p>\n<p>Not one to be outdone, Derek reached out, giving Stiles\u2019 nipple a tweak through the thin cotton of his t-shirt. \u201cAnything for my sugarplum,\u201d he said dryly. Stiles gaped, watching Derek take the plates and deposit them into the sink. </p>\n<p>The gaping soon turned into a wild, excited grin as Stiles sat up in his chair. \u201cCan that be a thing? The pet names? I am so down for this--I\u2019ll totally win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugged, grabbing the coffee pot to top off Stiles\u2019 mug. \u201cYou underestimate Erica\u2019s influence on me,\u201d he said seriously. </p>\n<p>\u201cBring it, baby cakes,\u201d Stiles dragged the mug towards himself, taking a long, greedy gulp of it.</p>\n<p>Derek waited until Stiles was about to swallow before grabbing the pepper shaker from nearby and holding it out, saying, \u201cif you\u2019ll be Pepper, I\u2019ll be your Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>A warble escaped from Stiles as he choked on a mouthful of coffee, slamming the mug down as much as he could without sloshing it and batting Derek\u2019s hand away. \u201cOut of bounds!\u201d he cried, \u201cTotally out of bounds!\u201d</p>\n<p>Out of bounds, Derek knew, because nothing turned Stiles on more than geek talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Derek gestured to the sink full of dishes--some from last night, \u201cif we\u2019re going to act like a couple, you should do your share of the cleaning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glowered, \u201clow blow,\u201d he said, but got up and rounded the bar to help. Derek loaded the dishwasher while Stiles wiped down the counters and started to put away the pots and pans that had been hand-washed. He was bending down to stick a pan under the oven when a loud grunt escaped him. Derek turned, surprised to see Stiles\u2019 bad leg trembling violently and Stiles resting his head on the edge of the counter. </p>\n<p>Derek shut the sink off, quickly taking the pan from Stiles. \u201cHow long did you go jogging yesterday?\u201d he asked softly--because the only time Stiles ever had issues with his leg this badly was when he pushed himself too hard and his body dealt with the consequences. </p>\n<p>Drawing in a deep, calming breath, Stiles stood up and took the pan from Derek. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just need to stretch it some more,\u201d he said dismissively, taking his time in putting the pan away--leaning heavily on the counter the entire time.</p>\n<p>He limped past Derek, using the counter for support to make his way around towards the living room. Derek came up behind him, hand reaching for Stiles\u2019 elbow to try and help him and getting his hand smacked away for his efforts. Derek frowned, resisting the urge to glower, and stormed into the bedroom to fetch Stiles\u2019 cane. </p>\n<p> Stiles was almost to the couch when he came back, and he looked furious to see the cane in Derek\u2019s hand. He snatched it from Derek, grabbing the bottom and thacking Derek hard in the thigh with the handle. Derek jerked, snatching the cane and holding it still. Stiles, pale and shaking, snarled, \u201cif if hurts too much to walk, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can barely stand,\u201d Derek pointed out. Stiles wrenched his cane back.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m having issues, doesn\u2019t mean I need you to wait on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s scowl deepened and Stiles sighed, setting the cane down and using it for support as he limped around the couch. \u201cYou know, if this pack comes, and they see you taking care of me? That\u2019s not good, dude. You <i>know</i> it isn\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what? You want me to sit and watch you be in pain? That\u2019s not what pack does, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighed, sitting down gingerly and shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll come up with some kind of code word if it\u2019s too bad or whatever, but I am not game for being a target just because you wanted to hold my hand every time I get a flare up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The worst part was that it made sense. It made so much sense that it infuriated Derek. Stiles had an annoying habit of constantly being right no matter how badly Derek wanted to prove otherwise. The Turners <i>would</i> look for weakness in Derek\u2019s mate, and Derek didn\u2019t honestly know if they were above using it against him. </p>\n<p>Huffing on a sigh, Derek clenched his teeth and turned on his heel to go and grab the muscle cream from the first aid kit under the bathroom sink. Even for werewolves, the stuff was a blessing in disguise. </p>\n<p>Stiles was stretching his leg along the length of the couch by the time Derek came back. Even though it had been a while since he\u2019d been hurt, Stiles was still supposed to do a little bit of physical therapy every day to keep the mobility. Derek knew that beneath Stiles\u2019 jeans was a thick, jagged scar from his knee up to the middle of his thigh.</p>\n<p> Given how deeply the knife had gone in, it was practically a miracle that Stiles could walk without a cane at all. His knee didn\u2019t quite bend as well as it should, and half of Stiles\u2019 pain was in his foot, hips, and thigh because of how he tried to distribute his weight to compensate for the lack of flexibility. </p>\n<p>When Stiles saw Derek standing there with the muscle cream, he sighed and flopped back against the couch to take the bottle. \u201cSorry, man. Just\u2026 ask first before you come help? Sometimes it\u2019s not that bad and I just need a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek got that, he really did. When Stiles had first gotten hurt, he was a constant ball of frustration and anger, lashing out at anyone and everything. It had gotten to a point where Derek had been terrified for months on end that Stiles was going to cut himself from the pack. Now that his leg was starting to really heal, Stiles had started to push himself more and more, always rejecting the pack\u2019s help like it was a burden more than a blessing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could let us help you,\u201c Derek muttered, walking around to sit on the arm of the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? And when you\u2019re not there to help me, I won\u2019t know how to take care of myself anymore,\u201d Stiles snapped, wrenching the cap off of the muscle cream and sucking in a sharp breath. He shook his head, handing the bottle over to Derek and then standing. Derek watched as Stiles positioned himself on the floor next to the couch, gesturing to let Derek know he was being allowed to help. Derek stepped forward as Stiles pressed a hand to his lower back, circling his hip area and the top of his rear to let Derek know where the source of his pain was located. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, can you just--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2018s fine,\u201d Derek interrupted, realizing that Stiles was probably cranky because he was in pain, and not because he didn\u2019t want help. He sat on the backs of Stiles\u2019 thighs, pulling down the elastic of his boxers enough to expose the sore part of Stiles\u2019 hip. He squirted some of the gel onto his hand first, screwing the cap back on and then placing his hands against Stiles\u2019 side. It didn\u2019t take more than a few rubs before Derek found the swollen, tense area full of knots. </p>\n<p>When Derek pushed down, Stiles let out a pained yelp, hands clawing at the ground. The more Derek massaged, the more Stiles squirmed and groaned in pain. It wasn\u2019t the good kind of pain, either. Derek could tell that he was rubbing out deep-set knots that had swollen up over time because Stiles was probably too stubborn to ask anyone to help him weeks ago when it should have first been done. </p>\n<p> It bothered Derek to hear the choked whimpers that came out of Stiles with each circle of his hands. Even so, he knew that when all was said and done, it would be worth it to see Stiles walking with a spring in his step and no pain in his eyes. </p>\n<p>Once the worst of it was over and Stiles was sagged into the ground, he grumbled, \u201cdo the rest, now I\u2019m uneven,\u201d in a tired, irritated voice. Derek laughed, pouring more of the gel onto his hands and getting started on the rest of Stiles\u2019 back. </p>\n<p>\u201cTell me more about this pack; do you know any of them?\u201d Stiles asked, his face smashed into the carpet. </p>\n<p>Derek frowned, digging his knuckle into a knot just below Stiles\u2018 right shoulder blade and earning a jerk and yelp from Stiles. \u201cI met Kylie when I was six.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026and?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe punched me in the face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughed, bouncing Derek\u2019s body with his cackling. \u201cMan, you\u2019d better hope this works out. I don\u2019t know if I could handle seeing you whipped like that,\u201d he wheezed. </p>\n<p>Derek rolled his eyes, pushing a little harder than necessary at the tense bunch of muscles on Stiles\u2019 spine. Stiles grunted as Derek said, \u201cshe\u2019s the daughter of their alpha. My mom was the alpha. We\u2019re both born werewolves. Our children would have come from great bloodlines.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence followed, broken only by the occasional huff or squeak when Derek hit a sensitive area. Finally, Stiles asked, \u201cdo you want children?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was hard to answer a question like that. Derek did want children; but it was a deep-set longing inside almost all born werewolves. It was an ache for something that was missing, a need to find the missing piece. \u201cNot with her\u2026not with someone I didn\u2019t trust and love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Stiles hummed, stretching and wiggling as Derek made one final sweep along his back. He sat up, letting Stiles roll over and impulsively ducking in to steal a quick, exhilarating kiss that was more of a peck than anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked, watching as Stiles\u2019 startled expression melted away into a grin. He nodded, reaching out to take Derek\u2019s offered hand as he got to his feet. </p>\n<p>\u201cLoads, dude. I could go wrestle a wendigo right now,\u201d Stiles chirped, beaming when Derek rolled his eyes. He reached out, clapping Derek on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get dressed before everyone shows up. You, uh, might want to put a shirt on,\u201d Stiles reached out, hands fast as ever, and pinched Derek\u2019s nipple with a violent twist. Derek hissed, swatting Stiles\u2019 hand away and snarling as Stiles took a step back and held his hands up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man, just evening the playing field. I\u2019ll have you know these perky peppers are very sensitive,\u201d he explained, cupping his palms over his chest gingerly, \u201cthey were violated. I had to return the favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo get dressed,\u201d Derek snapped, his mouth twitching not to smile a how utterly ridiculous Stiles was--and how badly he just wanted to kiss him and just beg Stiles to be with him <i>for real</i>. </p>\n<p>While Stiles headed off to get changed, Derek went to wash his hands off and check through his mail again. He read over the letter from the Turner pack again, gut twisting with increasing anxiety. It was formal and distant, but biting enough that, even on paper, Derek knew that they were coming to test Derek and his pack. </p>\n<p>There was a chance that, if they didn\u2019t pull this off, things could go to hell. The Turner pack would be within their rights to kill Stiles if found out, but more likely they\u2019d force Derek to take the betrothal to save the pack. The Turners were old blood, and the only reason they wanted Derek was probably because of his heritage and the heirs he could give them. He doubted it had anything to do with power that came from joining two packs.</p>\n<p>Folding the letter, Derek hoped that being helplessly in love with Stiles would be enough to convince the Turners and keep his pack safe. If not, he had no idea how things would turn out.</p>\n<p>When the pack stopped by later in the afternoon, Derek and Stiles were well on their way to getting accustomed to one another. Stiles had called in sick at his job, making sure to email his instructors and let them know of the same \u2018illness\u2019 so that they could email him his makeup work for the day. It had taken a good hour of coaxing for Derek to even get Stiles to agree, but it worked out in his favor in the end. </p>\n<p>Scott was the first one in the door, stopping full in the foyer so that Isaac and Allison bumped into his back. Stiles had decided to drape his legs over Derek\u2019s lap again, wiggling his toes demandingly until Derek had given in and rubbed his feet. If there was one thing Stiles was good at, it was milking a situation for all it was worth. So when Scott made a strangled noise to see Derek giving his best friend a foot massage like some kind of hand-servant, Stiles did nothing but grin lasciviously and wave his hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, buddy! Why don\u2019t you and your twosome--threesome?--take a seat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac brushed by Scott to do exactly that, his hand holding gently to Allison\u2019s fingers and guiding her towards the loveseat. Scott frowned, which turned into a disgruntled look as he glanced over at Isaac and Allison.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come nobody rubs <i>my</i> feet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Derek groaned under his breath while Stiles cackled and then yelped when Derek pushed against a sensitive part of his arch. </p>\n<p>When Boyd and Erica showed up a little while later, Scott and Stiles wasted no time in grilling Derek on anything and everything about the Turner pack. Stiles had pulled his feet out of Derek\u2019s lap at some point, and was curled up enough that he took up half the couch and left Derek squished onto the last remaining cushion. Derek didn\u2019t really mind, though, because it was better if Stiles had room to move his legs around in case they started bothering him. Not that he would admit knowing this; he\u2019d rather not be dealt with Stiles rubbing it in his face that Derek actually cared about anything other than ironing his pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo who are these guys? Obviously they\u2018re not related to Bootstrap Bill, right?\u201d Stiles asked, phone in hand as he texted away with someone. </p>\n<p>Erica snorted and Derek shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re bigger than my family ever was. They use their power to bring in other packs and make themselves bigger. They don\u2019t work on intimidation though, they kill with kindness. It\u2019s actually worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorse how?\u201d Allison asked with a frown. She was sitting between Scott and Isaac, leaning up against Scott with one leg crossed over the other. Now that their \u2018secret\u2019 was out, Isaac had no qualms about letting his palm rest on her thigh like it was an everyday occurrence. </p>\n<p>\u201cWorse like, if you deny their good will and hospitality, nobody bats an eye when they kill you in cold blood.\u201d Derek explained bitterly, jaw clenching. \u201cThey\u2019re bigger and stronger than a lot of packs around here. They have more connections than we could ever dream of having.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica cringed, \u201couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ouch was kind of an understatement, but Derek figured Erica understood the severity of the situation. Stiles made a thoughtful noise in the back of his throat, scratching a hand through his hair and then gesturing vaguely. \u201cSo are we talking old blood like the Weston Pack or the Deluna Clan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek paused, suddenly wishing he was still rubbing Stiles\u2019 feet so that he had something to distract him. It had been a long time since he\u2019d interacted with the Turners, but they were pretty hard to forget. They\u2019d practically strong-armed his parents into agreeing to the betrothal in the first place. </p>\n<p> \u201cThink nice like the Warners--\u201d Stiles made a noise of excitement; he always did like the Warners, they pampered him, \u201cbut bloodthirsty like the Deluna.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 pleased expression dropped into one of horror and Derek shrugged, feeling a mild pang of guilt for having to bring up the memory of the Delunas. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming out of good will\u2026\u201d he began, \u201cbut if they find out how we took their \u2018good offer\u2019 of merging the packs through marriage and threw it in their face with a fake engagement to a human? It\u2019s gonna be this all over again,\u201d Derek hesitated, and then reached out to press his palm wide over Stiles\u2019 thigh where they all knew sat one of his biggest scars. </p>\n<p>It was the scar that caused half of Stiles\u2019 issues. A scar that Derek could remember being a fresh, gaping wound that had nearly killed Stiles from blood loss alone. There was a reason Stiles hated to hear the name of the Deluna clan. They were a group of vampires out in Washington that were nothing like the ones from Twilight.</p>\n<p> When Stiles\u2019 father had first found out about the pack and everything it encompassed, he had sent Stiles away to live with an old family friend. No matter how badly the sheriff had tried to protect his son, it all went downhill when Stiles had started to snoop around and had stumbled upon a vampire\u2019s nest.</p>\n<p>Stiles, being nineteen and convinced that he could take care of himself, had decided he was going to perform his own investigation. Derek and the pack had barely arrived in time to stop things from going completely to hell.</p>\n<p>Derek would never forget seeing Stiles strung up to a ceiling next to four other teenagers, each of them littered in cuts that bled into buckets placed beneath their bodies. It had been Isaac who had been able to decapitate the head vampire. Derek didn\u2019t want to think about what could have happened if they had shown up even ten minutes later than they had. </p>\n<p>Stiles looked down at Derek\u2019s hand, mouth twisting into a frown. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of firepower,\u201d he whispered, sounding frustrated more than anything. Derek shook his head, unwilling to voice his agreement and instead rubbing his thumb over Stiles\u2019 scar and then pulling away. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need firepower,\u201d Isaac piped up, \u201cif you and Stiles keep acting like a couple, they won\u2019t have a reason to attack us, right? They\u2019ll think you\u2019re together.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek nodded, \u201cthey have no reason to doubt us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looked uneasily to Allison and Isaac while Stiles continued to stare at the scar on his leg. Erica, draped across Boyd\u2019s lap on the recliner, shrugged and sighed, \u201cif it gets really bad, we could always call on Jobo.\u201c</p>\n<p>Stiles perked up and Derek panicked, quickly blurting, \u201cNo Jobo,\u201d before Stiles could get any ideas in his head. Jobo was a yeti that they had run into last winter who had wandered down from Canada in search of another food source. Stiles had, for some ungodly reason, had formed some sort of odd friendship with her. The entire trip back up to Canada consisted of Derek driving behind the massive creature with Scott and Boyd in the car while it loped along with Stiles on her shoulders. </p>\n<p>Of course, that had been after they\u2019d spent two weeks tracking her by cleaning up after the sheer chaos and panic that Jobo had caused. Stiles was convinced Jobo was a distant relative of a comic book character named Lobo, but Derek didn\u2019t know DC comics enough to know if that was true or not. Stiles\u2019 explanation of, \u2018the love child of Wolverine and Gene Simmons,\u2019 didn\u2019t really help, either.</p>\n<p>Stiles sat up a little, throwing a hand out and waving it around. \u201c--but Jobo is all the power--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Huffing at Derek\u2019s interruption, Stiles flopped back on his side of the couch and crossed his arms petulantly. Derek reached out, placing a hand against Stiles\u2019 ankle in a way he hoped showed that he was somewhat apologetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre there any spells we can do?\u201d Isaac asked, \u201cMaybe ones that might help dull a werewolf\u2019s senses to keep them from noticing that your scents might be off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shook his head, \u201cI already texted Betp about it. We both figure anything that can dull the senses will mess with you guys, too, so it\u2019s kind of moot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac slumped into the couch, looking put out until Scott reached around Allison\u2019s shoulders to pet him on the back of the head.</p>\n<p> Boyd slid an arm around Erica\u2019s stomach, hooking his chin over her shoulder. \u201cI guess you won\u2019t have to complain about not getting laid anymore,\u201d he muttered to Stiles, the corner of his lip twitching. Stiles made a strangled noise in the back of his throat. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you know what. I\u2019m going to call my dad and let him know what\u2019s going on,\u201c he announced loudly, stretching and wiggling his fingers to try and reach his phone on the coffee table. Allison leaned forward, grabbing it for him and handing it over with a tiny smile hidden in the corner of her lips.</p>\n<p>While Stiles dialed his father, Derek got up to go and get some water. The pack broke off into a few different conversations with one another, talking in hushed tones as the werewolves in the group eavesdropped on Stiles and his dad. </p>\n<p>The sheriff sounded more pained than angry about it. From the mutter of his responses and the way he told Stiles that they\u2019d discuss it over dinner, Derek figured that he\u2019d just been woken up after a long shift. Stiles apologized profusely when he also realized this, promising to bring Derek and Scott over later and then hanging up.</p>\n<p>Hovering behind the couch, Derek watched as a myriad of expressions crossed over Stiles\u2019 face before he lifted his head with grave expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to go grocery shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh wow, will you look at that,\u201d Erica leapt from Boyd\u2019s lap, glancing at her watch and grabbing Boyd\u2018s hand to drag him to his feet, \u201cyou know I have a hair appointment in ten minutes so we have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison and Scott were getting up as well, pulling Isaac to his feet. \u201cSo, yeah, we should go and do some stuff before I meet you and Derek at your place,\u201d Scott explained, \u201cand you can totally let Derek help you out with the shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek felt victimized, crossing his arms and scowling. Just because he didn\u2019t openly complain about things did not mean he had any more patience standing in an aisle while Stiles compared the nutrition points in every brand variation of corn flakes. It only happened when the shopping involved food for the sheriff, but it was still wearing on one\u2019s psyche when having refried beans shoved in his face as Stiles demanded a second opinion. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, everyone leave, go on. I don\u2019t need you! See if I ever make cake balls for any of you again,\u201d Stiles grumbled, smiling despite his evident irritation. Scott, being the last one out the door, poked his head back in and smiled apologetically.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry dude, I\u2019m sure Derek will eat your cake balls.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek totally would eat Stiles\u2019 cake balls. They were delicious--and so much better than the ones at Starbucks that were more dough than anything. Not that he\u2019d admit it, because if there was one thing more frustrating than having a sweet tooth weakness to Stiles\u2019 cooking, it was letting Stiles know it and gloat about it. </p>\n<p>He ended up driving them to the store closest to Stiles\u2019 house, if only for the fact that Stiles knew the aisles and brands mostly by heart. While Derek pushed the cart, Stiles kept one hand on the side for support so that his cane could sit in the basket instead. In his other hand, Stiles held onto a crinkled list that they\u2019d compiled in the car of food they would get for dinner, and things to get for the pack. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust a dozen, or a crate?\u201d Stiles asked, peering at display upon display of eggs. \u201cThe crate is on sale--but are you gonna get sick of them like last time? Cuz, dude, finding two cartons of bad eggs was like my least favorite part of coming over last month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet a crate,\u201d Derek interrupted, frowning. The only reason he\u2019d gotten so sick of them was because the pack had been too busy to come over like they always did and he\u2019d ended up having more food than he knew what to do with. Stiles shrugged, grabbing a crate with a grunt and lowering the box of five dozen eggs into the cart. </p>\n<p>Standing up straight, Stiles scrubbed a hand over his head and hummed in thought. Derek didn\u2019t bother to ask what was going on in his head, knowing sometimes it was easier to just wait for the end result. Stiles tugged on the cart, pulling Derek back towards the ethnic foods aisle. \u201cDon\u2019t want to forget rice,\u201d he chirped.</p>\n<p>Derek stared down at the pound of rice sitting in the cart and frowning. He gave the cart a tug, \u201cI think a pound is enough,\u201d he said lightly. Stiles froze, glancing down at the cart for a long moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s good enough for now,\u201d he muttered distantly, and then looked back down at his list. Derek watched as Stiles started to mutter the foods under his breath, reminding himself what they\u2019d already gotten and what they hadn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>Sometimes, Derek almost forgets the shit they\u2019d put Stiles through; the hell and pain and torture that no human should ever have to go through. He forgets, and then Stiles has a relapse and it\u2019s like slapping Derek in the face with a huge sign reminding him of how much he\u2019s failed as an alpha already. The memory issue is never a problem until it is, until something stresses Stiles out or he\u2019s just had an eventful day and then suddenly he loses time.</p>\n<p> That lost time--that\u2019s their fault, it\u2019s Derek\u2019s fault. He started it by letting Erica hit Stiles in the head all of those years ago and never thinking to take him to a hospital when he found out. Derek should have known that one too many head injuries over time would build up. </p>\n<p>None of them had known--not until one day when Stiles had called his father in a panic, lost and confused because he didn\u2019t even remember taking a trip to look at a nearby community college in the next town over. </p>\n<p>\u201cCan I see?\u201d Derek reached out for the list, catching the familiar crease between Stiles\u2019 eyebrows that meant he was getting frustrated with himself. Stiles gave him a suspicious look, but passed the list over. Derek took it, skimming over the things he knew they\u2019d gotten that Stiles had sloppily penned out. He glanced into the cart and then said, \u201cthis is good enough for now. If you want to make dinner in time we should probably head back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah. We can get the rest later. Gotta get food for that other pack, too, anyway.\u201d Stiles took the list, shoving it into his pocket. \u201cWe have to feed them, right? Hospitality and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pushed the cart, letting Stiles take hold of part of the handle and lean against him the tiniest bit. \u201cIt would be a show of good faith if we did,\u201d he began, \u201cbut if you happen to cook them only tofu and egg whites, I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granted, Derek had nothing against tofu and egg whites--but when you had a distressingly high metabolism and a habit of shifting into an otherworldly carnivorous creature, meat became a very important part in one\u2019s diet. Usually the lack of meat in a meal would be enough to make Derek want to drop everything and go slaughter an innocent bunny just to get enough protein and iron to keep him from feeling agitated.</p>\n<p>His comment got the desired effect, though, because Stiles\u2019 frown turned into an amused cackle. \u201cOh man, don\u2019t tempt me,\u201d he moaned, elbow bumping playfully into Derek\u2019s side. Derek shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just letting you know that it\u2019s always an option.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes it scares me when you get all passive aggressive,\u201d Stiles teased as they reached the checkout, \u201cI\u2019m afraid one day I\u2019ll wake up to you putting my hand in a cup of water because I didn\u2019t wash my dishes or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s heart gave an unhealthy pull, suddenly filled with a painful longing. He knew Stiles was talking about the nights they had pack sleepovers--but that didn\u2019t stop him from wishing for something more. He would love for Stiles to leave his dirty dishes in the sink if it meant having Stiles all the time, in every way.</p>\n<p>Instead, Derek bit back a guilty grin, shrugging once to keep from agreeing or disagreeing with Stiles\u2019 claims, and started to put their food on the conveyor belt.</p>\n<p>When they got back to the apartment, Derek helped Stiles divide through the bags for which foods were meant for Derek and the pack and which bags had the food for the Stilinski men. He carried his share up to the second floor and Stiles left to go home, clean and make dinner. From what Stiles had bought, Derek figured he was going for stir fry so that he could feed everyone and not have to worry about his dad\u2019s health. </p>\n<p>After putting away the groceries, Derek gave in to the call to wander to his bedroom. He froze upon crossing the threshold, momentarily stunned by Stiles\u2019 scent that was heavy in the air. It only made his heart ache a little more and Derek decided it wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a nap before meeting with the sheriff. He crawled into bed, burying his face into the pillow Stiles had used and letting the smell lull him into a light doze. </p>\n<p>He got up with twenty minutes to spare for a shower and change of clothes. Stiles had wanted them all to be there by seven, which meant that the discussion would be during dinner. Food always did help to soften blows, in Derek\u2018s experience.</p>\n<p>Scott was already there by the time Derek showed up just two minutes past seven. Derek wasn\u2019t surprised that he was the one to open the door, especially when he caught the sound of Stiles and his father bickering in the kitchen over methods of food preparation. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Derek asked Scott softly. Scott shrugged, lips quirking down in that \u2018not bad\u2019 gesture that had become disturbingly familiar to Derek in the past few years. </p>\n<p>\u201cCould be worse. I think he\u2019s pretty much given up trying to stop Stiles from getting involved anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>That knowledge was two parts depressing and one part relieving, if only because these types of situations had happened so much that the sheriff was actually admitting defeat. Derek clapped Scott on the shoulder, nodding at him and heading for the kitchen.</p>\n<p>The bickering stopped almost immediately when Stiles and his father spotted Derek. Stiles\u2019 face lit up, gesturing wildly between his dad and Derek. \u201cThere, go bug him. Let me cook <i>in peace</i>,\u201d he demanded, sounding desperate. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing to that steak isn\u2019t called cooking,\u201d the sheriff grumbled, but stepped away to approach Derek, shaking his hand in greeting. \u201cSo, from what I hear, you two need to\u2026pretend to be married?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEngaged,\u201d Derek corrected, heading for the dining room to sit down. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. I didn\u2019t think the Turner pack would react this way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d the sheriff said dryly, scrubbing a hand over his face and sighing. \u201c--and I\u2019m guessing Stiles volunteered himself, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Scott cut in, grinning crookedly, \u201cwhen <i>doesn\u2019t</i> he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Stiles snapped from the kitchen. </p>\n<p>Shaking his head fondly, the sheriff bobbed his eyebrows, sighed, and plastered on a fake smile for Derek. \u201cSo, how\u2019s work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugged, feeling vaguely guilty that he actually should have focused at least a little bit on his work in the past couple of days. \u201cI\u2019m taking a break,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbeen having some blocks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hear that\u2019s the worst thing that can happen to writers,\u201d the sheriff agreed. This was true. In reality, Derek was just writing a cheesy teen romance novel that he hoped would get him some easy money for the time being. A lot of his writing was style regurgitation and basing the characters off of the pack. It made for a small fan base and limited stress about creating unique characters and situations.</p>\n<p>The only reason Derek had ever gotten into writing in the first place was so that he could be easily available to any pack member at any time, but still make an income without worrying about set hours. He\u2019d hated it at first, but over time it got easier.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, food\u2019s done!\u201d Stiles called out. Derek stood, letting Scott and the sheriff head in first to get their plates. He hovered next to Stiles--who always waited until everyone else had gotten their food--and bumped shoulders with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad seems to be taking this well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sucked in a sharp breath, holding it for a second and then letting it out. His heart rate was a little higher than normal, scent sharp with the acidic taste of anxiety. \u201cFor now,\u201d he uttered nervously.</p>\n<p> Even after all these years, anytime they had to explain any type of supernatural situation to the sheriff, Stiles would always worry that he\u2019d be sent away all over again. It didn\u2019t matter that his dad would never willingly put Stiles in that sort of danger by taking him from the pack. No amount of reasoning really stopped that irrational paranoia that seemed to stick with him no matter what, to follow him and tell him one day he was going to lose it all again. </p>\n<p>All of this, Derek only knew, because Stiles had confessed it to him at one point last year when they pack had ended up needing Stiles\u2019 father\u2019s help. It took three hours of arguing for Stiles to even agree to bring his father in, and even then it was like pulling teeth just to get Stiles to explain the situation. It was better now, but Stiles still had that fear deep down.</p>\n<p>Derek put his hand on the back of Stiles\u2019 neck, pushing down enough to ground him. Stiles twitched, and Derek squeezed his fingers until he felt the tension in Stiles\u2019 shoulders started go slack. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a shaking breath, Stiles nodded once, and then more firmly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed, \u201cwe\u2019re good. It\u2018s cool, no biggie. We\u2018ve got this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Derek agreed, patting Stiles\u2019 shoulder and then heading into the kitchen to get his food.</p>\n<p>In the end, it wasn\u2019t that hard to explain the situation to the sheriff. Stiles made sure to answer any and every question that came up, with Scott and Derek backing him up to he best of their ability. Derek covered what he knew of the Turners--which wasn\u2019t much. He told the sheriff about his few childhood interactions with them, and how they\u2019d practically strong-armed his family into agreeing to the betrothal. Other than that, most of the talking was still done by Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight,\u201d the sheriff pointed his fork at Derek, \u201cyou need my son to pretend to be your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFianc\u00e9,\u201d Stiles corrected. Sheriff rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that. So he needs to stay with you for how long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUntil the Turners are satisfied and leave,\u201d Derek explained. </p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stilinski, we\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s just like\u2026 political stuff,\u201d Scott added, \u201cI don\u2019t really think Stiles is in danger. They just wanna like, see the competition and then go back home or whatever.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles and Derek nodded enthusiastically, watching as the sheriff turned the words around in his head for a long moment. He speared some chicken onto his fork, grunting, \u201ccompetition,\u201d under his breath and shaking his head, \u201cfor Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowned, but Stiles was the first to jump to a response. \u201cDerek is totally competition-worthy, dad! Have you seen those pecs? That waistline?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been checking me out?\u201d Derek blurted, almost jumping in surprise when Scott choked on his soda and spit it back into his cup. Stiles and the sheriff turned to stare at him, and then Stiles gestured to Derek\u2019s body. Derek glanced down at himself, but he wasn\u2019t wearing anything out of the ordinary. It was literally the same outfit he wore almost all the time--a wife beater and jeans. It was the middle of spring, there was no way Derek was going to wear anything more than that. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour collarbone,\u201d Stiles hissed, \u201ccould collect the tears of angels.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means,\u201d Derek shot back. Scott finished wiping soda from his face and chin, clearing his throat, sighing, and giving the sheriff a weary smile. Stiles grinned, waggling his eyebrows and chomping on a mouthful of rice and vegetables. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he muttered, swallowing, \u201cwe\u2019re basically just letting these guys know that hey, Derek\u2019s taken. You can\u2019t have our alpha. No biggie. I just have to get my cuddle on with mister cranky pants over there so that nobody gets suspicious\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles trailed off, frowning at his fork and then setting it down to take a drink. \u201cI lost my train of thought,\u201d he mumbled with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were talking about cuddling Derek,\u201d his father supplied, looking less amused and more pained than anything. Stiles stared into his cup for a long time, swishing it around before he hummed. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well, yeah. I need to get my cuddle on with captain cranky over there because there\u2019s this pack of werewolves that\u2019s heading in. They had this ancient betrothal with--\u201d</p>\n<p>The sheriff stood abruptly, chair scraping across the ground. His face was grim, the age lines around his mouth and eyes looking deeper than ever. Stiles fell silent, as did Derek and Scott, all three of them watching as the sheriff walked out of the room. The sound of footsteps went all the way to the back porch, where the door opened and then slammed shut loudly.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 face was pale, hand shaking just the tiniest bit as he clutched to his glass. The more seconds that ticked by, the more distressed he started to look, until he finally turned to face Scott. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott shook his head, reaching out and putting his palm across Stiles\u2019 shoulders to squeeze and rub. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything, dude,\u201d he muttered, \u201cmaybe your dad had to go to the bathroom really really bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>The attempt at humor fell short, and Stiles stared down at his plate with a grim look. Derek hated that look. He hated the fact that it ever showed up on Stiles\u2019 face at all. It was a dark, self-loathing expression that told of a thousand emotions and none of them good. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Derek offered. He put his fork down, taking a quick sip of his water and standing. Stiles nodded, thumbing the rim of his cup and then glancing up at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to be sorry for,\u201d Derek pointed out, heading for the porch. Stiles would probably come out on his own in a few minutes, but he had a habit of avoiding confrontations if at all possible. </p>\n<p>The sheriff was sitting on one of the folding chairs placed along the patio. His elbows were on his knees, head in his hands as he scrubbed his palm continually through his hair. </p>\n<p>Derek sat down in the chair opposite him, looking up at the dark sky littered with smoky clouds and half-hidden stars. They sat in silence for a long time, broken only by the chirps of cicadas and the occasional hum of a car passing by on the street out front. </p>\n<p>\u201cCan you bring him home after this?\u201d Stiles\u2019 father croaked, lifting his head and staring at Derek. \u201cCan you keep him alive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would die for him,\u201d Derek answered, because it was true. He nearly <i>had</i> died for Stiles--more than once. Those moments had mostly been two parts stupid, one part pack, and all parts being hopelessly in love with a fragile human. </p>\n<p>The sheriff laughed, bitter and dry, looking out into the darkness of his back yard. \u201cWith the amount of times I\u2019ve heard that\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have thought he\u2019d be the way he is now,\u201d he mused, sitting back in his chair. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 father twisted his head, watching Derek with intensely focused eyes. \u201cYou know that\u2019s a load of crap,\u201d he said stiffly, angrily.</p>\n<p>Frustrated and unbearably guilty, Derek clenched his jaw and curled his fingers over his knees. \u201cIf I could go back in time and stop him from ever getting involved, I would. You know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their staring contest came to an abrupt end when Stiles\u2019 father shook his head, looking away with a sigh. \u201cI do\u2026and I wouldn\u2019t want you to,\u201d he said softly. Derek watched as he rubbed his palms over his thighs and stared up into the night sky. \u201cStiles is\u2026he\u2019s happy--happier than he has been in a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSheriff\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <i>forgets</i> things sometimes... and there are mornings that he has trouble getting out of bed\u2026but I think that doesn\u2019t matter, not when I never thought I\u2019d see him smile as much as he does. It\u2019s been a long time since he didn\u2019t need to fake it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time for me, too,\u201d Derek admitted, standing up and crossing over to settle his hand onto the sheriff\u2019s shoulder. He squeezed, in the same reassuring way he did with Stiles, and then looked up at the sound of someone approaching the patio.</p>\n<p>Stiles slid open the door, poking his head out and glancing over to Derek and his father.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad?\u201d he called out hesitantly, stepping onto the porch with the help of his cane. He hadn\u2019t been using it earlier, but it was completely possible that he\u2019d tried to rush to the door to eavesdrop and had ended up straining himself in the process. </p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 father stood, patting Derek on the back before approaching his son. \u201cIf you do this, you have to <i>swear</i> to me that you will stay near Derek or Scott, or one of the others at all times. Don't go off alone while that other pack is here, do you understand?\"</p>\n<p>Taken aback, Stiles nodded slowly and then more firmly. His dad let out the breath he\u2019d been holding, grasping Stiles\u2019 arms gently. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you hurt\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The cane clattered to the ground when Stiles lunged forward and into his father\u2019s arms. Derek stepped away, feeling out of place as Stiles clutched to his dad. He headed back inside, barely catching the sheriff muttering, \u201cyou\u2019re all I have left,\u201d before he shut the door. </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Derek woke up the next morning with Stiles draped across his back, legs akimbo and arms flopped like dead weight over his side and shoulders. He was still out cold, snuffling into the back of Derek\u2019s head like Derek was some kind of living pillow. He\u2019d been up late for a good part of the night, staying with his father for as long as possible to try and make up for the worry that he always put him through. </p>\n<p>In reality, they all knew it didn\u2019t do much more than temporarily put Stiles\u2019 guilt at ease. </p>\n<p>Derek slipped out from under Stiles, shuffling into the bathroom. </p>\n<p>Stiles was still asleep by the time Derek was out of the shower, dozing beyond the first pot of coffee being brewed. Derek was in the process of shoving some English muffins into the toaster oven when Stiles finally did join the world of the living. He meandered along, leaning heavily on his cane with eyes puffy from sleep and a mouth twisted into a tired scowl. </p>\n<p>When Stiles took his seat at the bar, Derek poured him a cup of coffee--adding a splash of milk, two ice cubes, and some sugar--and handed it over. Stiles made a pleased mumble in the back of his throat, burying his face into the mug and slurping at it. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a good fianc\u00e9,\u201d Stiles said sleepily, grinning at Derek while he attempted to put cream cheese on his muffin without making a mess. \u201cC\u2019mere, big boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looked up, staring blankly at the way Stiles was puckering his lips and gesturing for Derek to come closer. For a second, Derek had to struggle to breathe--to tell himself this wasn\u2019t real and that it was part of their routine. He swallowed, chest aching, and put the muffin down to lean over the counter and peck Stiles on the mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmh, so domestic,\u201d Stiles teased, and then returned to greedily sucking down his coffee. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to look at hotels,\u201d Derek went back to his muffin, \u201cI can\u2019t house their whole pack here and they\u2019ll probably want to stay for a few days--otherwise it\u2019s a waste of time to come all the way out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Humming incoherently into his coffee, Stiles peeked up with a wry grin, \u201cI can ask my dad where the hookers like to prowl, if you wanna show them some good ol\u2019 Beacon Hills hospitality?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorted, grabbing the second muffin and covering it in strawberry jam on one side, cream cheese on the other. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d he deadpanned, handing the completed muffin to Stiles.</p>\n<p>Looking proud, Stiles grabbed the jam-slathered half and lifted it in salute, going to take a bite and then hesitating when a thought struck him. \u201cOh--don\u2019t forget we need to go grocery shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe picked some food up earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid we get rice?\u201d Stiles chewed his muffin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek sat down next to him, sipping his coffee that was more cream than anything, \u201ctwo pounds of rice.\u201d</p>\n<p>His chewing slowed down to a stop, and then Stiles grabbed his coffee to take a quick swallow. \u201cJust wondering,\u201d he shrugged, even though they both knew that Stiles was only wondering because he couldn\u2019t remember half of the trip to the grocery store.</p>\n<p>Hotel hunting turned out to be more stressful and aggravating than Derek had anticipated. They had to find something in a good price range, but with spacious and well-maintained rooms that would make the Turner pack feel comfortable. After narrowing it down to three hotels in their area, Stiles had dragged Derek to a few thrift stores to buy some cheap photo frames and then to Stiles\u2019 place to pick up his camera and a few other things. </p>\n<p>They ended up heading back out again a half hour later after Stiles took at least a hundred selfies on his camera. Most of them consisted of their cheeks crushed together or awkward angles of them hugging and kissing. Derek\u2019s head was still reeling by the time they finally got back to his apartment. He was ready to slink off into the kitchen for some coffee when Stiles dragged him into a kiss, slipped some tongue, snapped a photo, and then meandered towards the couch to set up his laptop and print the images out. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat one should go by the front door,\u201d Stiles announced, \u201cso it\u2019s the first thing they see when they come inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek agreed faintly, mostly because he was feeling lightheaded from so much going on all at once. </p>\n<p>Stiles, after plugging in his laptop and letting his camera upload onto the images to photoshop, flopped back against the couch. \u201cMan,\u201d he sighed, \u201cI deserve all the sucked dicks for this. I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek closed the lid on the coffee maker after dumping some grinds into it, flicking the switch on. \u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d he said, trying not to think too heavily into his offer. If anything, they needed to be sexual to mix their scents together. There was no way they wouldn\u2019t raise suspicion otherwise. Most werewolves had a heightened sex drive and it was only stronger with an alpha. Just the idea of being with Stiles had his skin tingling and his chest aching with desire.</p>\n<p>A strangled noise came from the living room as Derek left the kitchen. Stiles was staring at him over the back of the couch, mouth agape. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s on your list, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Derek crossed his arms, \u201cwhat did you call it? \u2018Spunk exchange\u2019?\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 ears went red and his eyes widened. For a second, he made nothing but incoherent noises while flapping his lips. \u201cUh,\u201d he croaked, falling into a very familiar appearance of feigned confidence, \u201cI mean. Sure. Yeah. If you want to. You know. For the pack and all. Greater good. I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek went to lock the front door first, and then he approached Stiles on the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh? Oh\u2026y-yeah,\u201d Stiles breathed shakily, sliding down into a sit and watching Derek approach. Derek, internally, was a complete wreck. Stiles was just sitting there, his left leg tilted openly to the right and a flush rising up from his neck, and Derek <i>wanted</i>. He wanted more than anything--more than what he was going to be allowed to have. </p>\n<p>He knelt between Stiles\u2019 legs, bringing one hand up to rest it over the injured thigh and feeling the warmth radiating from Stiles\u2019 jeans. Stiles\u2019 pulse was racing, throat clicking as he gave an audible swallow. Derek started to rub Stiles\u2019 legs, focusing on the feel of muscle and skin shifting under his palms and not on the way Stiles\u2019 breath was growing short. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe only have to do this once,\u201d he said softly, trying not to sound pained at the knowledge that he could only <i>have</i> this once. Stiles\u2019 legs shifted under his hands, body slumping further into the couch and allowing Derek to spread his knees even further apart to make room for his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t enjoy it,\u201d Stiles pointed out, \u201cdon\u2019t look so angry about it. I can like.. I don\u2018t know--I\u2018ve got a great grip and--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Derek cut in, not even wanting to think about Stiles\u2019 hand on him. He barely had enough self control to do this--if they went any further, Derek was pretty sure he would be ruined for life. </p>\n<p>Stiles reached out, hand carding through Derek\u2019s hair before landing on his shoulder. \u201cDude, I can always jerk off in a jar or something for you, later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t smell the same,\u201d Derek muttered. In actuality, he had no idea if that was true or not\u2026but he would rather avoid finding out the hard way. </p>\n<p>Stiles nodded, shrugging. \u201cOkay well. In that case\u2026 uh\u2026mi penis es tu penis?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNevermind. Just do your thing, alpha man.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took all of his self control not to roll his eyes at Stiles. Instead, Derek started to shift his hands higher, rubbing and massaging at the crease of Stiles\u2019 thighs. Stiles shifted and the first real scent of arousal hit. It was a heady, thick smell, like smoked cloves and oranges, one that was intoxicating to Derek. He dipped his head, pressing his nose and mouth to the seam of Stiles\u2019 jeans and breathing in deeply.</p>\n<p>A tiny noise left Stiles\u2019 lips, barely louder than a whine. The hand on Derek\u2019s shoulder shifted and his fingers curled around Derek\u2019s neck instead. Derek dragged his hands up to the button of Stiles\u2019 jeans, popping it and dragging the zipper down over the curve of Stiles\u2019 crotch. Stiles\u2019 pulse sped up, his skin warming under Derek\u2019s touch. Derek took a second to stare at the way Stiles\u2019 fly was parted, showing the barest glimpse of a bulge beneath pale green boxers covered in palm trees wearing sunglasses. Derek huffed in amusement, glancing up to see Stiles shrugging.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t diss the undies, dude. These things are Egyptian cotton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek grinned, at least relieved to know that Stiles wasn\u2019t going to make this awkward. He settled both palms onto Stiles\u2019 hips, stroking up his stomach and then back down before grabbing onto his jeans and tugging them. Stiles shifted, lifting his bottom so Derek could pull his pants all the way off. It left the scar on his leg exposed--an angry, jagged marring of skin that instantly attracted Derek\u2019s eyes. </p>\n<p>He sighed, shaking his head and then frowning. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure this never happens again,\u201d he muttered, palming the scar. </p>\n<p>Stiles grabbed his hand, squeezing his fingers. \u201cDude, can we stop the self-loathing for today? I don\u2019t blame you so stop blaming yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally ruining the mood, here,\u201d Stiles pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you mentioned I was good at that one time,\u201d Derek mused, but tried to focus on Stiles\u2019 skin beneath his fingers. He stroked his palms up those thin, muscular thighs, feeling the way they jumped and tensed against his touch. Stiles\u2019 hand was still on top of the one covering his thigh, so Derek pressed his other one fully over the half-hard erection growing in Stiles\u2019 boxers. </p>\n<p>\u201cNnh, sometimes,\u201d Stiles choked, dick jumping under Derek\u2019s palm. He rocked up into the touch, hissing and squirming. \u201cJust don\u2019t make this awkward later, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek breathed, and bent forward to press his mouth where his hand had just been. </p>\n<p>He wanted to memorize this, the way Stiles\u2019 breath hitched and his heart hiccupped. There might never be another chance Derek would get to do this--to touch Stiles how he\u2019d been wanting to for years and to make him moan in all the right ways.</p>\n<p> Some part deep inside of Derek told him if he did this right, if he made it good enough, that Stiles wouldn\u2019t want anyone else. It was an almost desperate feeling to just keep him forever because nobody would love Stiles the way Derek did. Nobody would fight for him and protect him and learn with him as wholeheartedly as Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek reached up to pull down Stiles\u2019 boxers, tugging when they caught on Stiles\u2019 cock before it popped free. Stiles shifted, breathing in sharply and making an aborted motion to cover himself before he dropped his hand. Derek kept his eyes down, focused on the way Stiles\u2019 dick was resting up against the crease of his thigh, flushed and halfway erect. </p>\n<p>Ignoring the way his body throbbed with a pulse of desire--of the urge to push Stiles down and make him writhe in ecstasy--Derek reached out to curl his fingers around the base of Stiles\u2019 cock. </p>\n<p>Stiles attempted to speak, but it trailed off into a garbled, \u201cuuhnn,\u201d noise when Derek wrapped his lips around the head and started to suck. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been with anyone, but Derek did own a laptop and watching porn at some point was pretty much a given. If anything, it helped him remember to use his tongue and to cover his teeth while bobbing his head.</p>\n<p>The scent of Stiles\u2019 arousal was thick and intoxicating. It was like an aphrodisiac when coupled with the taste of his cock in Derek\u2019s mouth, salty and warm. Derek could feel himself getting hard just from the taste and smell alone. When Stiles dropped his head against the couch and let out a soft moan, it made Derek\u2019s entire body shudder with want. </p>\n<p>He tried to make it as quick as possible, sucking hard and sloppy with the sound of Stiles\u2019 panting groans as background. He was making Stiles feel good. He was the one causing those noises, and the reason that Stiles\u2019 was gasping for air and twitching under his touch. It was like a drug, one that made Derek give in to the desire to set a slower pace. He used his tongue, one hand pumping the base of Stiles\u2019 cock and the other gently massaging his balls. </p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 legs were quivering and Derek\u2019s own dick was painfully hard inside of his jeans when the hand that had been resting on the back of Derek\u2019s head went tense. Stiles choked, pants coming in sharp and fast with half-muttered curses escaping him.</p>\n<p>A thought struck Derek, just as Stiles\u2019 muscles started to tense. If there was one thing Stiles remembered, it was the people who made him laugh. He pulled off with a loud pop, voice hoarse as he said, \u201cit\u2019s mi pene es tu pene.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gaped, letting out a loud cackle that broke off into a strangled warble as he came in messy spurts all over his stomach and Derek\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>Wasting no time, Derek fumbled with his own pants to free his erection. He dropped his head against Stiles\u2019 knee, panting when he finally got a hand around himself. Stiles\u2019 cum smeared everywhere, covering Derek in his scent as he quickly stroked himself to completion. </p>\n<p>\u201cI was gonna help with that, but it looks like you\u2019ve got it under control,\u201d Stiles commented shakily, running his hands through Derek\u2019s hair and rubbing at the back of his scalp. Derek bit down on the corner of his mouth, pressing up into the touch. All he had to really do was replay the past five minutes in his head before he was spilling into his hand in a matter of seconds. Stiles was still catching his breath and Derek took that moment to bring his soiled palm up, smearing a mixture of Stiles\u2019 and his own cum all over the inside of Stiles\u2019 legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Stiles cried, \u201coh my <i>god</i>. You weren\u2019t kidding about the spunk exchange, were you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek panted, looking up at Stiles and raising an eyebrow like he wasn\u2019t on his knees and rubbing the results of their activities all over Stiles\u2019 legs. Stiles crossed his arms and rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well, first dibs on shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, all those times I said you sucked, this wasn\u2019t what I had in mind at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stood, tucking himself back into his pants and then heading for the kitchen to get something to drink. \u201cGo take your shower. Wash your legs last, but it should be enough to smell like the both of us anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhh, gotta love that werewolf love juice,\u201d Stiles hummed sarcastically, grabbing his cane after he tugged his boxers up. Standing, he scratched at his side and watched Derek drink his water. \u201cThis won\u2019t\u2026make things weird, will it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chest aching, Derek set his cup down. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do this, it\u2019s a little late for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you think it makes things weird. What do you want? Should I buy you a new radio for your car? Buy you some video games? A new cane?\u201d Derek fired off anything he could think of--anything Stiles might want. He couldn\u2019t have this going sour, not when Stiles had seemed so okay with everything until now. </p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles limped forward, looking more tired than in pain. \u201cI know this is for the pack. You don\u2019t have to keep reminding me. I don\u2019t need anything from you because it\u2019s not just for you--this is for all of us. We\u2019re in it together, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was painful and relieving all at the same time to know that Stiles didn\u2019t resent him for any of this, but that he felt it was some sort of obligation. Derek brought his glass back up to his lips and muttering, \u201cgo shower,\u201d before taking another sip--like the water could cool the burning in his chest. </p>\n<p>That night, when Derek crawled into bed and pressed their bodies as close as he dared, Stiles turned his head from where he\u2019d been staring out the opposite window.</p>\n<p>\u201cThings won\u2019t go back to the way they were before,\u201d he said quietly. Derek ducked his head down, trying to focus more on the way his knees almost touched Stiles\u2019 thighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles twisted onto his side to face Derek, mouth twisted into a scowl. Derek shook his head, wanting so badly to cup that soft cheek and to use his thumb to pull Stiles\u2019 frown into a smile. He swallowed, closing his eyes to try and hide the pain that he knew must have been showing in them. \u201cYou\u2019ll find someone else, though,\u201d he murmured, \u201cand it\u2019ll all mean something when you do this with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek practically felt Stiles\u2019 breath hitch in the stillness of the air. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said faintly. It hurt more than anything, that single word, because it joined the stammer of Stiles\u2019 heart. All because he was thinking of falling in love. </p>\n<p>With someone who wasn\u2019t Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek wasn\u2019t sure which woke him up first, the trill of Stiles\u2019 phone going off with his custom ringtone for Scott (an appropriately inappropriate midi of \u2018Werewolves in London\u2019), or his own phone vibrating on the night stand. Either way, he almost didn\u2019t want to get up when with a breath, Stiles\u2019 overwhelmingly addictive scent hit his senses.</p>\n<p>The reason was that Derek had somehow slunk down on the bed until his face was buried right in the softest part of Stiles\u2019 belly, one hand hanging limply over the front of his hips. Stiles grumbled, shifting and chuckling as Derek\u2019s tired sigh tickled him lightly. Derek pushed himself up just enough to grab their phones, answering the call on Stiles\u2019 and putting it next to his face before doing the same with his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmh?\u201d Derek mumbled to Boyd, tuning out the sound of Stiles grumpily mumbling death threats to Scott for waking him up.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurner pack is here. Came up to Scott and asked to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shot up, feeling instantly awake. \u201cWhat?\u201d he barked, \u201cthey\u2019re not supposed to be here yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, they are. Scott\u2019s taking them out for breakfast so you two have time to get out to his place. We were thinking the park on Alderwood. It\u2019s close to there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cScott says you\u2019re paying him back,\u201d Stiles piped up, \u201cand that he doesn\u2019t like the way Isaac is getting bedroom eyes from one of the betas, so we should hurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d Derek muttered to Boyd, \u201cwe\u2019ll get there as soon as we can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that like <i>I\u2019m</i> the one who comes up with bad plans,\u201d Boyd pointed out dryly. Derek snorted, muttering his goodbyes and hanging up as he climbed out of bed. He grabbed one of his shirts from where it was half hanging out of an open dresser drawer, tossing it to Stiles to let him know to wear it. Stiles caught the shirt, bickering lightly with Scott about whether the beta actually was hitting on Isaac or if he was just being paranoid.</p>\n<p>After changing into fresh clothes, Derek headed for the kitchen to brew a pot of coffee that would, hopefully, wake the both of them up enough to coherently and civilly face the day ahead. The last time they had tried to deal with anything stressful without the proper amount of caffeine, it had devolved into an intense screaming match that ended with Stiles punching Derek in the throat and pinching a nerve to temporarily paralyze his right arm. While Derek had been snarling and failing to get his arm to cooperate, Stiles had stomped off to set the kelpie on fire himself with hair spray and a lighter.</p>\n<p>Derek was contemplating what to make to eat as the coffee maker bubbled to life when Stiles shuffled into the kitchen and sat at the counter with a groan. His heart was stuttering a little faster than normal, anxiety growing thicker in the air by the second. Derek walked around to where Stiles was hiding his head in his arms, rubbing gently between his shoulder blades in slow circles. Stiles gradually started to go limp, voice barely above a mumble when he mustered the energy to talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we go over everything one last time? How did we get together and all that? Just for posterity\u2019s sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek rubbed Stiles\u2019 shoulders, thumbs digging just enough to make Stiles let out a low mumble of appreciation.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep with the rubbing, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Derek said dryly, squeezing Stiles\u2019 shoulders for emphasis.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stiles rumbled in a low, tired rasp, \u201cyou were being a stubborn alpha and I was being an even more stubborn human, and we ended up joining forces to take down a coven of witches. The clash of egos resulted in you falling for my witty charm, and I fell for your lack of emotion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have emotion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrooding and angsting don\u2019t count,\u201d Stiles grumbled. Derek\u2019s thumb ghosted over a knot and he dug in until Stiles let out a squeaking grunt and jerked his arm back to elbow Derek in the gut.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay. You have <i>some</i> humor hidden deep in that black heart of yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Derek conceded, patting Stiles on the back and then returning to the kitchen to pour them both a cup of coffee. Stiles lifted his head up, watching with eyes puffy from sleep and hair that was so disheveled it looked like it had been sent through a hurricane. He looked awful and exhausted and Derek wished he could have Stiles like that every morning for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>After dropping two ice cubes and a dash of vanilla creamer into Stiles\u2019 cup, Derek stirred it around and slid it over the counter to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to change,\u201d he pointed out after another beat of silence. \u201cThat\u2019s how it went, except for the part where we got together when we really didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles made a face, stirring the ice in his mug and then blowing on it before taking a sip. \u201cYou make it sound like we\u2019ve made horrible life choices.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Derek hedged, staring at his mug of black coffee and then peering at Stiles over the rim, \u201cyou are missing out on some pretty awesome foot rubs,\u201d he mumbled, taking a sip as Stiles snorted loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all you were going to be bringing to the table, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not missing out on much at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I have to keep some secrets in the bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God. Go, leave me--actually, no, make me food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek huffed, biting back a grin and setting his cup down to open the fridge. He snagged a container full of grapes, placing it in front of Stiles with a chaste peck on the cheek before heading into his room to get his phone and wallet. Stiles made a noise of offense from the kitchen, muttering to himself about Derek being a terrible future-spouse.</p>\n<p>By the time they were in the car and headed for the meeting spot with the Turners, Stiles had gone from prepared and organized to a ball of nervous energy. Every few seconds had him unfolding his list, checking it over, and then reaching out to touch his hand to Derek\u2019s arm or shoulder like he could lay his scent on just a little thicker. It didn\u2019t really work like that, but Derek didn\u2019t have the heart to tell Stiles to stop when it seemed to be one of the only things keeping him from jumping out of the car guns blazing to shoot the entire pack down and be done with it.</p>\n<p>The park was just in view of Scott\u2019s apartment, heavily lined with trees and nature walks leading up to a small forest area further down. There was a small group of people situated at a picnic table with Scott, Isaac, Allison, and Boyd. Derek recognized Kylie\u2019s dark red hair, but from a distance he wasn\u2019t sure who the others were. Henry Turner, their alpha, was nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>Pulling into a parking space, Derek had barely turned the car off before Stiles\u2019 hand was grabbing at his wrist in an almost punishing grip. Derek hesitated, glancing first to Stiles\u2019 hand and then up at his worried face. Stiles frowned, \u201cDid you tell them I\u2019m a dude?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even tell them you were human,\u201d Derek confessed, feeling bad for how blunt it came out when Stiles made a face like he wanted to throw up. Derek twisted his palm around until his fingers were laced with Stiles\u2019, taking a second to memorize the feel of it before he squeezed gently and said, \u201cjust breathe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m breathing. I am so breathing right now. I have all the breath in the world.\u201d Stiles chattered, staring down blankly at their clasped hands. Derek\u2019s palm felt clammy against the sweat of anxiety coming from Stiles\u2019 skin.</p>\n<p>His thumb brushed over the curve of Stiles\u2019 knuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re panicking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to punch you in the throat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorted, rolling his eyes to hide the relief that came from hearing Stiles resort to one of his normal threats of violence that came out when he was stressed. He glanced out the windshield, catching sight of everyone watching them and waiting for them to get out of the car. It was the perfect chance to steal a kiss, and Derek did just that. Cupping the back of Stiles\u2019 head, he pulled Stiles in until their foreheads were pressed together. Stiles\u2019 eyes fluttered shut, recognizing the surprisingly familiar gesture of comfort that Derek gave to pack members every now and then.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Derek murmured, \u201cWe just need them to see we\u2019re in love, and they\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d Stiles breathed. Derek pulled away, frowning at the sharp ache that came from those words. No matter how true they might have been for Stiles, they still hurt.</p>\n<p>Stiles looked up at him, confusion turning into a scowl. \u201cYou know, most werewolves have a good track record for being stubborn. I don\u2019t think a couple of kisses is going to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter make them count, then,\u201d Derek said softly. Stiles rolled his eyes dramatically, but tilted his chin forward and pursed his lips in the anticipation of a kiss. It was such a silly and natural gesture that Derek had to draw in a short breath and tell himself this wasn\u2019t the real thing before he bent forward to press their lips together. Stiles sighed against his mouth, lips parting and body rocking into Derek\u2019s like it was instinct to deepen the kiss. Derek took a second to rub the back of Stiles\u2019 head and neck, pulling whatever pain he could find (as minor as it was) to try and help Stiles relax.</p>\n<p>When they pulled away, Stiles took a long while to open his eyes. He did it gradually, tongue darting out to wet his lips and then gaze flickering down to his cane. Sucking in a breath, Stiles held it for a second, nodded, and then let it out before getting out of the car. Derek did the same, watching Stiles hesitate before he grabbed his cane as an afterthought. He didn\u2019t use it, though, instead pressing in close to Derek\u2019s side so that Derek could put a steadying hand against his lower back as they made their way towards the group.</p>\n<p>Kylie had grown a lot since Derek had seen her last, but she still looked so much like her mother that it was easy to spot Jen by her mousy brown hair when they got closer. Both women had narrow hips and equally narrow shoulders that made for a slight figure overall.</p>\n<p>Kylie was the shortest in the group, a good foot shorter than the two men of the pack. Derek didn\u2019t recognize either one of them--from the younger one with short blond hair, to the older one with glasses and a thicker build who smelled a lot like ozone and human the way that Deaton did. Other than that, there were two other women. Derek knew the older one was Kylie\u2019s aunt Amber from her bustier build and thick, dark hair, but the younger one was also unfamiliar. From what he could tell, she might have been related to Amber since they both had the same dark waves of hair and round hips.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 hand reached back, pulling Derek\u2019s palm from the base of his spine and instead clutching to his fingers like some kind of mutant crab. Derek didn\u2019t mind it, giving him a reassuring squeeze as they drew closer to see almost the entire Turner pack staring at them in horror. Derek inhaled sharply, catching the sharp scent of an alpha and trying to discreetly glance around. Henry was absent from the meeting--which could only mean...</p>\n<p>Jen stepped forward, and the scent grew thicker--like rosemary and sage into an overpowering smell that made Derek\u2019s head spin. Kylie\u2019s mouth was wide open, staring blankly at Stiles in what was likely shock at realizing he was a human male. The unnamed girl was sitting on the bench with Isaac, both of them doodling in her sketchbook like they could care less about what was happening. The human seemed interested in what was going to happen, but Derek wasn\u2019t sure if that was a good thing or not.</p>\n<p>The one who made Derek on-edge was the other werewolf; the one with a twiggy frame, blond hair and an increasingly surprised expression that bordered on hungered the more he looked at Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek was about to pull Stiles in close just to let the other werewolf know he was off-limits when Kylie let out a dramatic squeal of Derek\u2019s name. It made him jump in surprise, barely able to pull his hand out of Stiles\u2019 grasp when she lunged at him in a violent hug. Derek stumbled, grunting at how much force such a tiny woman had managed to put into her embrace. Her nails were sharp, bordering on claws as they dug into his back like she wasn\u2019t going to let go anytime soon.</p>\n<p>In fact, Derek was pretty sure if she squeezed any tighter that blood was going to be drawn. From next to them, Stiles let out an amused sound. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can think of some other things that are cute,\u201d piped up the blond werewolf as Kylie finally pulled away (not without taking a bit of Derek\u2019s shirt with her). That\u2019s when Derek realized that blond guy was watching Stiles with a quirk to his lips like he was greatly enjoying what he was seeing. It reminded Derek of all the old \u2018Little Red\u2019 jokes the pack used to make at Stiles. This guy was more of a Big Bad Wolf than Derek could ever be.</p>\n<p>A coil of possessiveness shot through Derek like bullet. He reached out instinctively, hand circling Stiles\u2019 waist and dragging him in as close as he could manage. Stiles grunted, hand coming up to pinch Derek\u2019s bottom in a way that was probably meant to be more of, \u2018don\u2019t act like a child,\u2019 than \u2018I\u2019m okay with this manhandling.\u2019</p>\n<p>Jen didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash at Derek or Kylie\u2019s behavior, instead smiling wide and gesturing to Derek. \u201cDerek, sweetie, you\u2019ve grown so much! Have you taken over your family\u2019s home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was set on fire, if you don\u2019t remember,\u201d Derek said dryly. Amber sighed, cocking her hips to the side and tilting her head as she watched Derek with dark, scrutinizing eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what your inheritance and life insurance are for, honey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tensed in Derek\u2019s arms, eyebrows bobbing as he glanced to the ground with a low breath of, \u201cWow.\u201d</p>\n<p>A strangled, tight noise came from Jen that maybe wanted to be a laugh and was slaughtered during the escape. \u201cWhen you told me you were engaged, I have to say I was expecting something a little more...female.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t actually specify,\u201d Derek\u2019s fingers tightened on Stiles\u2019 hip while Jen glossed her eyes over Stiles like he wasn\u2019t worthy of a full look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to assume. You just didn\u2019t seem the type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGay has a type?\u201d Stiles interrupted, leaning a little more into Derek\u2019s side like it was the only thing keeping him from saying something that would get them all killed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, no.\u201d Jen hurriedly tried to fix herself, head shaking and making some of her hair fall from where it was tucked behind an ear, \u201cI just meant he very much liked girls back in the day. He and Kylie got along so well when they were children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Stiles and I get along great now,\u201d Derek snapped, a little too harshly than he really should have. It was worth it, if only for the bright grin that seemed to light up Stiles\u2019 face. Amber bumped shoulders with her sister, focus sliding down to the cane Stiles was holding loosely in his free hand.</p>\n<p>She hummed thoughtfully, \u201cIt looks to me like your definition of \u2018great\u2019 involves putting your fiance in danger. You do know humans are breakable, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stiffened into Derek\u2019s side, practically tensing for a fight. Derek squeezed his hip, hand rubbing up and down his side and frowning. \u201cI know more than anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blond werewolf approached, hovering on Jen\u2019s other side and crossing his arms as he dragged his eyes all over Stiles\u2019 body and then grinned. \u201cLooks kind of stubborn to me, mom. Can\u2019t fault him for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Stiles agreed, chest puffing out proudly. Blond guy approached, reaching a hand out for Stiles to shake.</p>\n<p>\u201cDevin, but you can call me Deej.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeej?\u201d Stiles echoed.</p>\n<p>Deej quirked an eyebrow, \u201cComing from you? <i>Stiles</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...touche,\u201d Stiles mumbled. The leering smile that Deej gave Stiles was enough for Derek to tense his shoulders. Every single drop of the alpha in him was telling him to take this beta down and to physically remove him from anywhere near Stiles\u2019 vicinity. Instead, he controlled that urge into a deep scowl when Deej\u2019s fingers dragged along the inside of Stiles\u2019 palm as he pulled away. He smelled like interest, but part of it seemed like excitement--as if he was doing this to test them.</p>\n<p>Jen cleared her throat, giving her son a dark look before completely morphing it into a cheerful smile as she faced Derek and Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a walk? We\u2019re a little out in the open for this kind of conversation. Wouldn\u2019t want to attract too much attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a group of people standing around in the woods isn\u2019t suspicious,\u201d Stiles muttered under his breath. Derek nudged him with a hip, biting back a grin at the nasty look Jen shot him--like she wanted to crush him beneath her heel. Stiles was completely unaffected, pressing right back into Derek\u2019s hip check with one of his own as they made their way towards the nature trail.</p>\n<p>Derek left a steadying hand against the lowest curve of Stiles\u2019 spine--partially for support and partially to keep himself from turning around and punching Deej in the face when he realized the other werewolf was lingering to get a better view of Stiles\u2019 assets. Kylie was on Derek\u2019s other side, chattering on about how much she\u2019s matured and become a great werewolf over time, but Derek had a hard time listening to her when Stiles started listing a little in his stride. He wanted desperately to force him to use the cane, but Derek knew from experience that would only make Stiles angrier and more likely to <i>not</i> use it.</p>\n<p>Then again, listening to Kylie was only a small fraction less aggravating than what Allison was going through as she, Isaac and Scott were flanked by Amber and Jen. Isaac had been keeping to himself for the most part, hands in his pockets and shoulders hunched as he kept two steps behind Scott. Derek wasn\u2019t really sure exactly how developed his relationship had become with Scott and Allison, but he was at least a little grateful that they were being subtle enough that Jen and Amber didn\u2019t find something else to harp on. Instead, they were practically henning Allison about the possibility of childbirth and whether or not her \u2018frail human body\u2019 could survive birthing more than one cub.</p>\n<p>It was another five minutes before they reached the rest area at the center of the trail. There was a small cluster of picnic tables, which Scott led the group towards. A glance back showed Boyd talking quietly to the human of the group who had, for the most part, kept to himself. Deej and the werewolf girl Derek didn\u2019t know the name of were bickering softly about pack etiquette. At least someone had noticed Deej\u2019s inappropriate behavior towards Stiles. That made Derek feel a tiny bit better-- not that he\u2019d admit it.</p>\n<p>Stiles was leaning heavily against him as they made their way towards one of the benches. There was a sheen of sweat dotting the back of his neck, thick with the scent of pain. Deej appeared at Stiles\u2019 side, ducking in low and frowning in concern. \u201cAre you okay? You seem hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Stiles grinned, bumping shoulders with Derek, \u201cI\u2019ve had way worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of listening to Stiles, Deej grabbed at his elbow and pulled him away from Derek\u2019s side to tug him down to the nearest bench and force him to sit. Derek tensed, clenching his jaw when he had the urge to snarl and snap like some kind of aggravated teenager. If he were shifted, all of his hair would be standing on-end like a dog ready to fight.</p>\n<p>Stiles flitted his eyes over to Derek, pursing his lips and giving his head a little half-shake to let Derek know there was nothing to start a fight over. Derek realized that it was entirely likely that Deej was supposed to show interest in Derek\u2019s fiance to try and draw them away and make the relationship seem unreliable. It was the exact kind of tactic that Derek would expect from them--especially if Henry was out of the picture. If that were the case, Derek was going to have to trust Stiles\u2019 ability to handle it on his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you hurt your leg?\u201d Deej asked softly, taking a seat next to Stiles. Derek tried to listen in as Stiles told him about the Deluna clan, but that was when Jen decided it was time for her to bond with Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you so much for letting us come here,\u201d she said, setting a hand on Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAfter my husband died and I became the alpha, I knew we had to find Kylie someone to help her carry on the bloodline. She and her brother are all I have left and...well...as you can see, my son\u2019s interests lie in a \u2026 less productive orientation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stared, in a state of shock over the words coming out of Jen\u2019s mouth. She was like every bigoted old person Derek had ever been forced to deal with. When he\u2019d been a kid, Henry had done most of the negotiations with the family while his wife had quietly kept to the side. He\u2019d never really talked to her before now and he was almost glad for it--because a younger Derek wouldn\u2019t have had the control to keep from lashing out at some of the things she said.</p>\n<p>When Derek didn\u2019t say anything, Jen took it as permission to keep talking, \u201cand you know, born werewolves are such a rare breed nowadays--especially with all the hunters popping up and thinning out the selection. It\u2019s important that Kylie find a nice alpha to help carry on the bloodline...\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes strayed to where Stiles was grinning and chatting with Deej. A pang of possessiveness shot through him, his insecurity making it harder to keep from going over there and whisking Stiles away from Deej and his stupid smiles that seemed to urge Stiles into talking even more.</p>\n<p>\u201c-- know a born werewolf for an alpha is more likely to bear sons? It\u2019s all in genetics nowadays. I even read an article online about how some doctors can let you choose your child\u2019s hair color and everything. Humans are terrifying when you give them too much wiggle room.\u201d</p>\n<p>From nearby, Stiles made a soft noise--one for Derek\u2019s ears only-- that was a startled squeaking grunt of relief that meant his pain was being taken away.</p>\n<p>Whipping his head around, Derek zeroed in on where Deej was leaning into Stiles with a palm wide over his thigh as he sapped away the aches and pains there. A snarl burst from deep in his chest, loud and animalistic in a way that had Stiles and everyone else looking at him in surprise. Deej didn\u2019t pull away instantly, instead dragging his hand slowly from Stiles\u2019 leg and then giving Derek a tight, fake smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cConsidering you\u2019re engaged, you\u2019re pretty inattentive to your fiance\u2019s pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles can take care of himself,\u201d Derek said sharply, curling his hands into fists and watching the way Stiles glanced from him, to Deej, and then back to Derek before quirking an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>Deej shrugged one shoulder, \u201cTo a point,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut he\u2019s just a human. You should be making exceptions for him. Did you make him walk with you all the way out here just so he could seem strong?\u201d Scowling, Deej turned to face Stiles, eyes scanning his body for injuries he might not have seen before. \u201cIf he\u2019s hurting you in any way, you can always leave him. I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not hurting me,\u201d and that was Stiles\u2019 amused tone, the one where he was trying to be consoling but on the inside he was probably cackling in glee at Derek\u2019s pain.</p>\n<p>Derek crossed his arms, narrowing his eyes at Deej in a way he knew to be intimidating. \u201cI\u2019m not hurting him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej\u2019s fingers kneaded at Stiles\u2019 thigh, massaging over the scar. Derek tensed, upper lip curling back as he bit out, \u201cIf Stiles was in enough pain to affect his walking or movement, I would know. He\u2019s stronger than you think. Humans don\u2019t break as easily as everyone assumes. They bounce back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might be strong for a human, but he\u2019s still a human,\u201d Deej chastised gently. That was when Stiles\u2019 amused expression turned miffed, which Derek knew meant he was going to start getting annoyed soon. Might as well see if he could get Stiles to stop acting so innocent before Deej tried to whisk him off in a plastic bubble.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you think humans are fragile? That they should be treated like glass?\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej glanced over to Stiles before shaking his head. \u201cI think humans are strong willed, but they require a certain amount of care put into them,\u201d he explained lightly, standing up and holding a hand out to help Stiles to his feet. \u201cJust because he can bounce back doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be there every step of the way to give him support. You\u2019re not a very attentive fiance.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a tiny twitch in Stiles\u2019 left eyebrow that told Derek he didn\u2019t really have to say anything at all. He grunted a tiny, noncommittal noise as Stiles took Deej\u2019s hand and pulled himself up. The next second was dizzying as Stiles whipped his cane around and hooked it behind Deej\u2019s knee, wrenching forward to force it to buckle. Deej jerked, trying to shift his balance and yelping as Stiles used their clasped hands to shove at his shoulder, at the same time he used his good leg to kick Deej\u2019s foot out from under him.</p>\n<p>Deej went down in a tumble of limbs, landing on his back and staring blankly up at the sky. Stiles pulled his cane back, giving it a little twirl and humming, \u201csmothering never went over real well with me,\u201d before shooting Deej a wicked grin.</p>\n<p>The entire clearing began to reek of arousal. The beta girl who had previously been drawing quietly made a choking sound strangled on a laugh while Jen brought a hand up to rub at her temples. Derek rolled his eyes, gesturing for Stiles to come over, \u201cGet over here before he tries to take your clothes off,\u201d he snapped, biting back an amused grin despite himself. Stiles set his cane down, using it just enough to even out his gait as he came up next to Derek\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d he chirped, twisting to steal a kiss from Derek before snuggling up into his side like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>\n<p>Derek couldn\u2019t help but wrap a hand around Stiles\u2019 shoulders, turning to kiss his temple while muttering, \u201cnice one,\u201d in a voice so low that only Stiles and the closest werewolves could hear.</p>\n<p>Amber made a sound of disdain, \u201cyou might think that sort of behavior is cute, but I bet that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s gotten him all those scars. He reeks of pain. If anything, you letting him do whatever he wants is why your human is practically broken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles isn\u2019t broken!\u201d Scott roared, jumping to his feet from where he\u2019d been sitting next to Allison and Isaac on the bench. Kylie snarled, getting in between Scott and Amber and flashing her teeth. Scott shifted, baring his fangs as Isaac and Boyd crowded in on either side of him, ready to attack at a moment\u2019s notice. Allison\u2019s right hand shifted, curling in to where she usually kept a small dagger taped against her arm--hidden beneath her sleeve. Other than that, she didn\u2019t move except to grab Scott\u2019s elbow to keep him from lunging forward.</p>\n<p>The artist beta ducked her head down, peering up between her bangs at the bloodbath ready to happen and then mumbling, \u201cthis is almost as bad as Twilight,\u201d under her breath. Stiles cackled, reaching out to gesture for Scott to de-wolf or at least back down from attack mode.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, man. They\u2019re just jealous they don\u2019t have one of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, no offense, but humans aren\u2019t really useful,\u201d Amber pointed out, ignoring the way Scott\u2019s eyes flashed angrily. Jen reached out, placing a hand on her sister\u2019s shoulder and shaking her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe magic ones are useful. Look at Alex.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d the human from their pack chimed in, lifting his head from where he had been typing things on a tablet. \u201cForget you ever saw me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m totally magic,\u201d Stiles butted in, lifting his cane and wiggling it around, \u201cdid you miss the scribble art on my mojo stick?\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Jen or Amber could make any other kind of backhanded comment, Derek stepped in. \u201cOther than having come here to insult my fiance, are you satisfied?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kylie made a sad face, frowning and looking at Stiles like he was some kind of homeless kitten as Jen turned to her daughter and pet some of her hair from her face. \u201cWe were just having conversation. Anyway, I\u2019d like to see the town a little bit. We haven\u2019t been here since my husband was alive. Maybe Kylie and your...betrothed...could do with getting to know one another.\u201d</p>\n<p>The frown on Kylie\u2019s face became a grin, canines elongated as she flashed them at Stiles. Apparently she ate homeless kittens for breakfast.</p>\n<p>A dismayed sound came from Deej. \u201c<i>I</i> wanted to get to know him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d snorted the quiet beta, \u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Ivanna,\u201d Deej hissed, \u201cgo draw your butts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wish you had these butts,\u201d Ivanna muttered under her breath, glowering at her cousin and looked back down at her sketchbook just as Amber came over and wrenched it away. Ivanna tried to grab it back, but Amber swatted her daughter\u2019s hand away and tucked the sketchbook under her arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t draw while we\u2019re with guests, Ivanna. That\u2019s rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look on Ivanna\u2019s face promised a swift and unpleasant death for Amber, eyes narrowing in anger before she pulled her phone out and instead began to text someone.</p>\n<p>Boyd, hip leaning against the picnic table, gestured to Jen and Amber. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are all tired. we can show you the hotel we booked for you...it\u2019s not too far from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently, just thinking about being free from the Turner pack was enough for Stiles to sag a little into Derek\u2019s side. Derek rubbed his arm firmly, patting it and then giving Jen and Kylie the best smile he could muster--which probably made him look constipated. Stiles always liked to tell Derek when his smiles made him look constipated.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get settled at the hotel and we can catch up over dinner tomorrow? You did show up earlier than expected. We weren\u2019t exactly ready for you,\u201d he offered, taking Stiles\u2019 elbow nudge in his side as a sign to hurry up with the goodbyes. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, we have a few errands to run, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWedding stuff!\u201d Stiles piped up, looking over to Derek and smiling at him and then at Jen. \u201cYou know how it goes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sometimes Derek had a habit of forgetting how strong Stiles really was, but he was always reminded in moments like this, when Stiles reached behind him and gave his left asscheek a strong slap and squeeze that had Derek grunting and rocking forward. It was a good thing Stiles was a human, because he was the only one besides Allison who wasn\u2019t able to scent how much that playful grope had turned Derek on. Scott, looking horrified, stared between Derek and Stiles while Isaac\u2019s eyebrows shot up and Boyd pointedly turned away. Deej, on the other hand, let out a soft whimper.</p>\n<p>That might have egged Derek on to retaliate, palming Stiles\u2019 bottom through his jeans and squeezing just shy of painful. Stiles made a warbled grunt before patting Derek on the chest and saying, \u201cthat\u2019s the stuff, babycakes. Now, lets go pick out flowers.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second they were back into the car, Stiles sagged against the chair like all of the muscles in his body had left him. He groaned, sobbing out, \u201cMy God, it was like being in a pack of harpies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could have gone worse,\u201d Derek muttered, starting the car and looking behind himself to pull out of the parking space. \u201cAt least nobody got killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love your optimism,\u201d Stiles replied dryly. Derek rolled to a stop at the sign before the main road, turning to Stiles and reaching out to clasp his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re okay,\u201d he said, trying not to give into the guilt that told him that all of this stress was his fault alone. \u201cJust another day or two and they\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sucks.\u201d Stiles grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>After a quick detour to the downtown precinct to update Stiles\u2019 dad on the pack and let him know that yes, Stiles was alive and no, he hadn\u2019t been threatened with bodily harm, they made their way back to Derek\u2019s apartment for some down time.</p>\n<p>The only problem was that when Derek opened the door, Deej and Ivanna were sitting on his couch chatting with Boyd and Erica. It was instinctual for Derek to shove Stiles back, a snarl punching right out of his chest and his fangs elongating. They were intruders in his home and the fact that Derek hadn\u2019t been the ones to let them in was enough to set off all the alarms in his head. He could feel Stiles trying to peer over his shoulder, curious as to why they had visitors.</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah there, tiger,\u201d Deej stood, holding his hands out and then jutting his chin just enough to show Derek the pale column of his throat. \u201cWe come in peace.\u201d Stiles\u2019 hand was a gentle touch between his shoulder blades, and even though he was human, it was like he was sapping the anger right out of Derek.</p>\n<p>Ivanna leaned to the side around Deej\u2019s legs so she could be seen from where she still sat on the couch. \u201cOur family sucks. We want to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Erica chirped, grinning crookedly. Derek rolled his eyes, all hostility gone as he moved to let Stiles in the apartment and then shut the door. Of course Erica would like her. She liked anyone who was down for a little subterfuge.</p>\n<p>Stiles, instead of going to take a seat, wrapped his arm around Derek\u2019s waist and gave Deej a hard, contemplative look. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some plan to seduce me, right? I mean, dude, you\u2019re cute, but you\u2019re not <i>that</i> cute. Derek is my boo, you can\u2019t compete.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour boo?\u201d Derek echoed dryly. Stiles pressed a finger to Derek\u2019s lips, squishing and wiggling them back and forth as he made a shushing noise. Derek tried to glare at Stiles\u2019 finger, but all he managed to do was cross his eyes and look foolish enough that Stiles was cracking a grin and biting back an amused snort. </p>\n<p>When Stiles pulled his hand away and tugged Derek towards the loveseat, Derek didn\u2019t even think to stop him and sat down obediently next to Stiles. The second Stiles\u2019 feet were in his lap, he began to unlace his sneakers without question. Deej quirked an eyebrow, but nothing else was said on the matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why are you here, if you aren\u2019t trying to whisk me away in the dead of night?\u201d Stiles asked, wiggling around on the loveseat until he was comfortable. Ivanna snorted and Deej looked uncomfortable for a minute, like he was trying to think of the easiest way to explain the situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not pack by choice,\u201d Ivanna offered, nudging her cousin with her shoulder in support. Deej nodded, and Ivanna continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re the only ones who aren\u2019t crazy in the whole family. Half of the betas can\u2019t stand them, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have betas?\u201d Derek asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnes back home--ones that mom turned after...after dad died.\u201d Deej answered. \u201cShe doubled the size of the pack in like, a month or something. It was nuts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know how that feels,\u201d Stiles muttered, shooting Derek a pointed look that got his toe pinched in retaliation. Stiles grunted, digging his heel into Derek\u2019s thigh and then yelping and kicking out when Derek tried to tickle the sole of his foot. \u201cHey! We\u2019re trying to have a serious conversation here!\u201d he cried, reaching out to try and swat Derek\u2019s hands away. Derek snatched his wrist, using Deej and Ivanna\u2019s presence as an excuse to pull Stiles\u2019 hand forward and tap a chaste and apologetic kiss to his knuckles. Stiles\u2019 face flushed, red prickling down his throat and disappearing into the collar of his shirt.</p>\n<p>Satisfied, Derek let his wrist go and sat back, gesturing for Deej to continue. Deej was watching the two of them with a mixture of sadness and amusement--an expression Derek knew well enough.</p>\n<p>Ivanna reached out, placing a hand on her cousin\u2019s arm and giving Deej a tiny smile before looking back at Derek and Stiles. \u201cThe issue is that they\u2019re all turned werewolves. I know Derek is the only born wolf in your pack, but that\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to go. They must be desperate to find a born werewolf to bring into the pack, otherwise I don\u2019t really know why they dragged us out here if they don\u2019t plan on bringing you back with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have him,\u2019 Stiles blurted sharply, pulling his feet from Derek\u2019s lap to sit up properly. Derek\u2019s chest clenched, breath catching in his throat at the sheer <i>command</i> in Stiles\u2019 voice. Stiles must have noticed Derek\u2019s surprise, because he glanced over and scowled in confusion. \u201cWhat? They can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek surged forward, capturing Stiles\u2019 lips in a chaste, biting kiss. Stiles let out a noise of surprise, hand flying up to cup Derek\u2019s face and parting his mouth just enough that Derek could nibble on his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are happy together,\u201d Deej said quietly. Derek broke away from the kiss, startled by the longing in his voice. Deej was staring down at his clasped hands, thumbs flicking over one another and leg bouncing. \u201cI think my dad would have liked to see that if he were alive. He\u2019d hoped you had found someone by now...too bad mom killed him before he could find out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence fell over the room for a long moment as Stiles\u2019 heart skipped. Derek couldn\u2019t even find words, instead opting to reach for Stiles\u2019 hand still resting on his shoulder to lace their fingers together. Erica and Boyd glanced at one another, both uneasy.</p>\n<p>Ivanna set her pencil down, thumbing it awkwardly and then frowning. \u201cWhy do you think it took this long to call out on it? Uncle Henry didn\u2019t want to do that to you, but Kylie... She can\u2019t keep a boyfriend very long and Jen was getting desperate to marry her off just to get an heir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t she keep a boyfriend?\u201d Boyd asked softly.</p>\n<p>Ivanna snorted, \u201cshe\u2019s pretty much the devil.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles let out a strangled laugh, one that sounded more like a stifled sob than anything. Deej flopped back against the couch with a tired sigh. \u201cShe\u2019s hella controlling, man. Like, I came out a few years ago and I thought mom was gonna kill me. Kylie was spoiled before, but after that, it\u2019s pretty much been Hell. It\u2019s like they\u2019ll do anything to keep our bloodline going. The only guy who would ever marry Kylie would pretty much need to be spineless and have a high pain tolerance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, does she beat them up or something?\u201d Erica asked lightly, attempting humor. Deej pursed his lips, gesturing for Ivanna to explain.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s the alpha\u2019s daughter and a girl. She\u2019s always gotten her way; she can pretty much do anything she wants. Seriously? No one is going to believe a lawsuit saying a five two woman broke a man\u2019s collarbone and put him in the hospital. Especially not when he\u2019s covered in claw marks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss dad,\u201d Deej said faintly, kicking his legs out childishly. \u201cMom wasn\u2019t so bad when he was around. I just... do you know how fucked up that is? Your parents are fighting and then your mom just kills your dad in his sleep because she wasn\u2019t getting her way? Ivanna and I are like the only ones who can see that. Kylie and Amber think she hung the moon, and all of the betas are ones that she turned or are too afraid to do anything about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you even live with that?\u201d Derek asked. His family, when they had been alive, had been kind and loving. They were nothing like the pack Deej and Ivanna were describing--broken and ruthless and divided. It made his skin crawl just thinking about it.</p>\n<p>Smiling thinly, Ivanna turned to Deej and nudged shoulders with him. \u201cWe spend a lot of time out of the house. Mall rats don\u2019t really get noticed much in a crowd, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shifted, stretching his sore leg out and leaning against Derek for support. He let out a pained grunt and Derek instinctively reached out to rest his hand over Stiles\u2019 thigh to take some of the pain. Stiles shot him a grateful smile before looking back to the betas. \u201cWhat can we do to help?</p>\n<p>That was exactly what Derek <i>didn\u2019t</i> want to hear. Any time Stiles offered a hand to someone, it inevitably ended in bloodshed and a few more years off Derek\u2019s life (and probably some gray hairs on his temples).</p>\n<p>Not wanting to see this go down a dangerous path, Derek leaned in until his lips were brushing Stiles\u2019 ear. Softly, he murmured, \u201cthis is out of our hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shot him a look clearly stating that it was so far in their hands it might as well have been superglued.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf... if you help us--help Deej become the alpha--then you won\u2019t have to worry about marrying Kylie anymore.\u201d Ivanna said slowly. Stiles sat up straighter and Derek narrowed his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to kill an alpha to become an alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej pursed his lips, staring down at his hands. \u201cI was hoping you could help us find another way. Just something... I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s not really my mom anymore, and Kylie\u2019s fucking nuts. I know Stiles has experience at magic. Alex does too, but he doesn\u2019t really deal with the old school junk. Those runes, that means you know a lot about the old ways, right? There\u2019s got to be something we can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles said faintly, \u201cthese runes I found in a book. I know jack about werewolves and how to make an alpha without killing one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ivanna sagged back into the couch with a sigh and Deej\u2019s face fell. Derek wanted to say something to make it better, but since he had killed Peter to become the alpha, it was a little hard to offer any sort of advice to the younger werewolf.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles moved to get up, hand reaching out to use Derek\u2019s shoulder for support when he jarred his leg too much. \u201cI think I know someone who might. Well, I mean. I think I know a place where we could find that kind of stuff,\u201d he turned to face Derek, grinning wide and hopeful. \u201cYou think Gabby\u2019s shop is still open?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glanced over to the clock, frowning. \u201cShe has her apprentice running the shop now. It\u2019ll be open.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Stiles breathed, \u201cNick! He can save us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNick gave your whole body static cling for a week when he tried to fix your phone,\u201d Erica butted in, \u201cremember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles cringed, making a pinching motion with his fingers. \u201cJust a little cling. Besides, he\u2019s still new. He totally makes up for it with his mad cleaning and organizing skills. Dude, I found like, three books on kelpies when I went there last.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a good thing?\u201d Ivanna asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a <i>great</i> thing,\u201d Stiles corrected, \u201cbecause the owner is a hoarder.\u201d Stiles pushed himself into a stand, turning to grab Derek\u2019s hand and tug him up as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Deej said firmly, \u201cI want to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to help. There\u2019s no way I was gonna do this alone.\u201d Stiles laughed. Derek frowned, tightening his hold on Stiles\u2019 hand and then looking down at their clasped palms.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m coming too.\u201d Okay, so Derek was usually banned from the research portion of things, but he wasn\u2019t going to let Stiles be left alone with Deej if he could help it. Without his family around, Deej didn\u2019t seem to lay the charm on as thick, but Derek wasn\u2019t going to take any chances.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh,\u201d Stiles grinned, winking.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The White Rabbit was a decently sized bookshop hiding behind a strip mall. It sat directly on the border between Beacon Hills and a small neighboring town called Sutter Creek and attracted a variety of people--supernatural and human alike. The outside was plain and nondescript, but the inside was where the magic (literally and figuratively) happened.</p>\n<p>Stiles was the first one through the door, happy to shove it open and make the bell overhead jangle loudly. Derek stayed close behind as he marched across the ornate entry rug that hid a multitude of sigils carved into the floor. The counter was empty, and a quick sniff told Derek that whoever was manning the store had not been keeping post for at least an hour. Stiles tapped the bell on the counter and Deej kept himself busy by snooping around the books on a display that read <i>\u2019STILL A BETTER LOVE STORY THAN TWILIGHT.\u2019</i></p>\n<p>Stiles flicked the bell again, frowning. \u201cHang on. he's probably hiding in the back reading some five hundred year old journal that doubles as a romance novel.<i> Nick!</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a shuffling noise in the back before Nick popped his head out. Nick was someone that Derek had a hard time forgetting. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was the strong jawline and almost cherubic face with a \u2018smile that could light a room\u2019, or his habit of trying his hardest to outdo Stiles\u2019 spells with his own self-taught magic. Those usually ended with one of them setting things on fire or Nick fumbling to clean up any messes before Gabby found out.</p>\n<p>Still, where he was lacking in actual magic skill, he made up for with his impeccable management of the bookstore. Also, he and Derek shared a love of pastries and Derek knew exactly which ones from the shop down the road could get him an extra discount on whatever book Stiles inevitably ended up buying.</p>\n<p>Stiles called him the embodiment of Captain America, which--other than his competitive streak a mile long-- probably wasn\u2019t that far off.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, hello, sorry! I was reading!\u201d Nick called out, hurrying quickly to the counter and waving around the book in his hands for emphasis. Derek wasn\u2019t quite sure what country he originally came from--only that his accent was crisp and succinct, with a slight curl on a few words that made Derek assume it was Dutch or German. \u201cGood to see you. How are you? Are the kelpies taken care of?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah dude. They\u2019re totally roasted,\u201d Stiles grinned, peering at the book in Nick\u2019s hands and raising an eyebrow. Derek caught the title and almost choked on his spit when he realized it was pretty much the supernatural equivalent of a smutty romance novel. Nick caught on quickly and fumbled to flip the book so that the cover was facing down.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve read all the other books in the store!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Maybe you can find me a book about werewolf hierarchy and bloodlines?\u201d Stiles asked cheekily, leaning up against the counter and wiggling his fingers towards Nick\u2019s book. Nick snatched the book up, using it to swat Stiles over the knuckles, which made him yelp and draw his hand back with a pout.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay \u2018please\u2019,\u201d Nick cajoled, eyes flitting up and his entire body freezing when he caught sight of Deej. Deej brought a hand up, wiggling his fingers and leering in a way Derek was starting to grow familiar with. \u201cWho is your friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh?\u201d Stiles twisted around, glancing back at Deej and then looking over at Nick again as a sly expression flickered across his face. \u201cOh, that\u2019s our buddy Deej. He\u2019s the one who needs the book, you know. So you should totally help us out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nick fumbled with his book, quickly stuffing it under the counter. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so? Usually you just come in here and pester me for discounts. You\u2019re making me look bad.\u201d With that, Nick quickly disappeared into the back store room after one last glance over his shoulder at the three of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo does that mean he\u2019s not taken?\u201d Deej blurted. Stiles\u2019 face lit up like it was Christmas day and Derek wanted to groan. If there was one thing he loved to do more than running off into life-threatening danger, it was to try and play matchmaker. Both situations usually ended in tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d Derek answered, \u201cHe\u2019s completely single. You should talk to him and stop hitting on my fiance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww,\u201d Stiles cooed, whirling around and throwing his arms around Derek\u2019s shoulders, \u201cI knew you loved me, honey bunch!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tried to frown but it was hard when Stiles was peppering his mouth with stupid, childish little kisses that made his stomach do funny things.</p>\n<p>When Nick returned with the book, Stiles plucked it from his hands and dragged Derek off towards the reading nook to crack it open and get some reading done. Derek crammed in next to him on the massive plush armchair, settling his arm over Stiles\u2019 shoulders and peering down at the introduction page.</p>\n<p>While Stiles flipped to the index and thumbed through the book to find the right pages, Derek tuned in to the conversation happening at the front desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re an apprentice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a very good one,\u201d Nick sounded flustered--his accent growing thick on some of his vowels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to Stiles. He only uses me for discounts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorted just the tiniest bit, cheek rubbing against the side of Stiles\u2019 head and getting tickled by the soft hair there. Stiles must have heard Nick, because he called out, \u201cYour boss overcharges, anyway!\u201d before going back to reading.</p>\n<p>A soft chuckle came from Deej, followed by an awkward pause and then, \u201cso where are you from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBelgium.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Is the cream as good as they say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 body shook against Derek\u2019s chest as he bit back the laugh that wanted to break out. Nick made a tiny, confused noise. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek peered over Stiles\u2019 head to see Deej\u2019s face turning red and his hands fumbling to pick up books he\u2019d knocked over on the counter. \u201cI mean the ice cream. That\u2019s what your country is famous for, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nick reached out to pluck some books from Deej\u2019s hands, putting them back into their proper stacking order. The corner of his mouth twitched up into a shy smile, his dark blond bangs casting a shadow over the top of his eyes when he peered up at Deej. Derek tapped Stiles\u2019 shoulder with his thumb and pointed over to them. Stiles lifted his head, letting out a tiny cooing noise and elbowing Derek right back in the gut like he was the one to spot it going down.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so good in America, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej frowned, \u201cyou sure? Have you been to a Cold Stone? They\u2019re pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Nick fiddled with the corner of the book in his hands. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any in Sutter Creek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s one in Beacon Hills. I saw it on our way out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should show me sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles jerked, turning and slapping Derek frantically and violently on the leg until Derek had to reach out and grab his hand to make him stop. \u201cI know,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wiggling, Stiles grinned and wagged his eyebrows, mouthing, \u201ctotally flirting,\u201d like it wasn\u2019t obvious. Derek rolled his eyes, pulling Stiles\u2019 hand up to his mouth and kissing at his knuckles. Whatever energy had been shooting through Stiles was gone in a heartbeat as his focus flickered down to their hands and then back up to Derek\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>He looked surprised. Like he was finally understanding something.</p>\n<p>Gut sinking and anxiety twisting like a knife into his heart, Derek started to pull away. Stiles was catching on--he had gotten too close and now there was no going back. Stiles was going through a myriad of expressions, from confusion to disbelief before he frowned.</p>\n<p>There was an apology ready to burst from the tip of his tongue when Stiles lurched forward and stopped it with a kiss. </p>\n<p>It was just like every other kiss they had shared, except for one thing. Stiles tasted like desperation. His hands curled into Derek\u2019s shirt, dragging him impossibly closer and sliding his palms upward. Fingers carded through his hair before Stiles was clutching the back of his head, like he was begging Derek with his body to just return the kiss like his life depended on it. Derek was reeling, stuck on the part where Stiles had caught on to his feelings and was doing the complete opposite of rejecting him.</p>\n<p>When Stiles\u2019 thumb pressed against the back of his left ear--the one place Derek was ticklish-- it was like breaking that last bit of restraint. Stiles was the only one who knew about that spot; was the only one who would have cared to remember even if he wasn\u2019t. It was like the thousandth reminder of why he loved Stiles and the first of many reasons why Stiles might just love him back.</p>\n<p>Derek twisted his body, wrapping one hand around Stiles\u2019 back and shifting them so that they fit together more comfortably. Stiles gasped out a curse of, \u201cyou fucking <i>jackass</i>,\u201d before he was diving in and kissing Derek all over again. Derek couldn\u2019t even muster a response other than to cup Stiles\u2019 face and bite at his top lip when Stiles tried to pull back for a breath. It was intense and frenzied and they were probably making a lot of noise from the smacking of their lips, the shifting of clothes and the way Stiles was practically breathless in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you guys keep that up, I might actually have to kick you out for public indecency.\u201d Nick called out from the front of the store. Derek wrenched his head up, one hand still holding Stiles\u2019 thigh over his hip and the other around his back. Stiles\u2019 laugh was borderline hysterical, face flushed and mouth kiss-swollen. His eyes, though, were what got Derek. They were happy, brighter than Derek had ever seen.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t even realize he was grinning until Stiles reached up and pinched his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you two were together,\u201d Nick mused. Derek snatched Stiles\u2019 wrist, pulling it down and looking over to where Deej was giving Nick an odd look.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nick looked thoughtful for a second and then nodded seriously. \u201cI can see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beaming, Stiles moved to play with Derek\u2019s fingers. \u201cDid you hear that? We\u2019re predictable, sweetums.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Deej muttered, \u201cyou two are giving me tooth rot. You can keep Stiles, dude. I don\u2019t think I could handle the pet names.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t mean to, but he puffed his chest a little in pride. That is, until Stiles pinched him on the nipple and gave him a dirty look that clearly meant, \u2018I am no trophy wife, you big caveman alpha,\u2019 which had Derek deflating a little.</p>\n<p>Wiggling out of Derek\u2019s lap, Stiles grabbed his cane from where it had been sitting against the armchair. Apparently their activities had caused more of a strain than Derek had realized, which caused a sluggish, heavy feeling of guilt to sit low in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna get this book,\u201d Stiles said, setting it on the counter. Deej looked panicked for a moment, eyes darting from the book and then up to Nick.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can have Ivanna pick me up in a little while. You guys look like you want some alone time, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay,\u201d Nick began, ringing up the book, \u201cI can give you a ride home after my shift. That is, if you don\u2019t mind a couple more hours waiting around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej beamed, leaning up against the counter and gesturing vaguely. \u201cIt\u2019s not waiting at all. You kinda know a little about everything. I know a lot about nothing. I\u2019m seeing a connection here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles reached out to pull on Derek\u2019s sleeve, \u201ctake me home before I kill myself from secondhand embarrassment.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was something Derek had no problem doing. It didn\u2019t help that hearing Stiles say, \u2018take me home,\u2019 had Derek\u2019s possible caveman alpha instincts going wild with the desire to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>The car ride home was a quiet one--but that was mostly because Stiles was frantically flipping through the book he\u2019d bought. Every now and then, he would ask Derek a question or two about betas versus alphas, but he kept quiet more than anything. Derek tried to reach over to grab his hand--to see if maybe what had happened in the bookstore really was more than what they\u2019d been pretending-- but Stiles had slapped his hand away.</p>\n<p>He would have been hurt, but Stiles did it with a hiss before leaning against his door and snapping, \u201cdude, I am like ten seconds away from giving you road head. Reading this book is like the only thing saving us from like, eight traffic violations.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was pretty much all Derek needed to hear to send every single one of his worries flying out the window.</p>\n<p>Getting back to Derek\u2019s apartment didn\u2019t go exactly as planned, though. Stiles\u2019 memory must have lapsed halfway through the trip because pulling into the parking lot had him glancing around in confusion. He was still frowning when they made it up to Derek\u2019s place, to a point where Derek had to take his hand and get him to sit down on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI...\u201d Stiles trailed off, watching Derek take a seat next to him. \u201cThe bookstore, what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s heart sank, and he reached out to shakily take Stiles\u2019 hand. Just because Stiles forgot, didn\u2019t mean that his feelings were gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think what we have isn\u2019t what we originally thought,\u201d he muttered, peering up at Stiles nervously.</p>\n<p>Stiles sighed loudly in relief, sagging back against the couch. \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tensing immediately, Stiles\u2019 eyes fell to their hands. \u201cNothing... it\u2019s just... sometimes I forget, right? I forget where I am or what I was doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek agreed, unsure if he liked where this was going. He rubbed his fingers over Stiles\u2019 knuckles, trying to show him that whatever he said, Derek wouldn\u2019t hold it against him. Sometimes it worked--when Stiles\u2019 anxiety was open to affection. Other times, little touches like that could backfire. Derek didn\u2019t think this was one of those times, though.</p>\n<p>Stiles gnawed on the inside of his cheek and then shrugged one shoulder. \u201cSometimes I try to fill in the blanks...like... stuff gets made up or something. Dreams or memories or something that didn\u2019t really happen. I just... I wasn\u2019t sure, but it felt so <i>real</i> this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis time?\u201d Derek echoed, watching in awe as Stiles\u2019 neck and ears began to flush, and he looked anywhere but at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, dude. This time...\u201d Stiles finally looked over at him, grinning crookedly. \u201cMaybe there will be a next time if we can make Deej the alpha. Then you won\u2019t have to marry Kylie. You won\u2019t have to go with someone that\u2019s...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s no better than Kate?\u201d Derek supplied. Kate didn\u2019t come up much at all anymore, but Stiles had been the first person Derek had ever fully talked to about it. That had only been, initially, because Stiles had figured most of it out and then confronted Derek--but the significance was still the same.</p>\n<p>Stiles reached out until his palm was cradling Derek\u2019s jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone that\u2019s not me,\u201d he corrected.</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t even think. There were no words or thoughts that came to him other than the uncontrollable need to have Stiles in his arms. He didn\u2019t hesitate for a second to give in, reaching out and pulling Stiles against his chest until they were clutching to one another like it could somehow bolster them for the days to come.</p>\n<p>Derek wasn\u2019t sure when it happened, but one minute he\u2019d been holding tightly to Stiles, and the next they were kissing and Stiles was pushing him back against the bed with a grin, ducking down to bite gently at Derek\u2019s top lip.</p>\n<p>Derek was almost distracted entirely by having everything he wanted in his arms at that very moment, but he was, by nature, someone who got trapped in his thoughts too often. When Stiles started to pull at his shirt, Derek reached out to snag his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d he breathed into Stiles\u2019 mouth, kissing once and then saying, \u201cwait,\u201d more firmly as he dropped his head back against the pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Stiles frowned, looking at where Derek\u2019s fingers held his wrist hostage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKissing?\u201d Stiles guessed hesitantly, brows pinching together in a way that made the tiny sliver of a scar on his temple stand out in the moonlight coming in from the window. \u201cGroping? Horizontal mambo? Topless tango? Well, not topless yet... I\u2019m working on that.\u201d Stiles tugged gently on Derek\u2019s shirt for emphasis.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Derek grumbled, a coil of irritation rising up in him. Stiles\u2019 heart was skipping a little in that nervous manner that was painfully familiar. When Stiles started to twist the fabric of Derek\u2019s shirt between his fingers and lick his lips hesitantly, Derek sighed. It wasn\u2019t hard to tell when Stiles wanted to ignore confrontation--and apparently this was too new for him to really discuss what they had going on.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it have to be complicated?\u201d Stiles asked weakly. Derek didn\u2019t like the way Stiles\u2019 eyes were darting all over his face. It was like Stiles was trying to find the answers in Derek\u2019s eyes or in the line of his mouth. He didn\u2019t particularly feel like arguing or trying to pry answers out of Stiles just yet, so he reached up and hooked his hand behind Stiles\u2019 head to pull him down into a kiss.</p>\n<p>Stiles went along with it easily, dragging Derek\u2019s shirt up and over his head and wiggling so that he was sitting right on Derek\u2019s crotch instead of on his hips like before. It sent a sharp and electrifying thrill through Derek\u2019s entire body, hands groping forward and scrambling to pull at Stiles\u2019 shirt. He wrenched it up, laughing when Stiles made a strangled warble as the collar pulled on his nose. Derek was still chuckling when Stiles dove back in, chasing that laugh with kiss after kiss.</p>\n<p>At some point, Derek started to grind his hips upward in slow, systematic rocks that had Stiles gasping into his mouth. He dug his fingers into Stiles\u2019 hair, memorizing each smell and sound that came from him, wanting to make sure he never forgot the taste of Stiles\u2019 lips or how his mouth was soft when he kissed and hard when he grinned.</p>\n<p>Palms groping along Derek\u2019s stomach, Stiles gave a shallow downward thrust, hissing and tensing. It wasn\u2019t a good kind of tense, not when a tiny and pained sound broke out from deep in his chest. His thigh shook against Derek\u2019s hip, hands flying out to grasp at the mattress. \u201cFuck,\u201d he cursed, clenching his eyes shut and then dragging in a slow breath, \u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCramp? Or did you overdo it?\u201d Derek wriggled into a sitting position, helping Stiles ease himself up and to the side so he was laying down beside Derek. Stiles was so tense he was practically vibrating out of his skin, jaw clenched and a furrow in his brows. After a second, he started to relax, sagging slowly into the mattress.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I overdid it,\u201d Stiles rasped with a scowl, \u201cwhich sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Derek rolled over, throwing an arm across Stiles\u2019 chest and pulling him into a slow and lazy kiss. \u201cWe can try again later,\u201d he murmured, knowing the best way to cheer Stiles up was to give him something to look forward to down the road. Stiles, mollified, pressed back languidly, mouth open and tongue darting out every so often like he just wanted a quick taste of Derek\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>Stiles started to drift off at some point between kissing Derek and having his hair petted. He went slack, snuffling a little as his eyes fluttered sleepily. Derek ran his fingers through the short hair at the base of Stiles\u2019 skull, nuzzling against his cheek and petting a hand down his side. His chest ached, gut twisting with fondness at the way the years seemed to melt away from Stiles\u2019 face as sleep overcame him. He looked innocent and vulnerable in Derek\u2019s arms, head lolling against Derek\u2019s bicep and heartbeat evening out gradually.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long before Derek gave into sleep as well, burying his face in the curve of Stiles\u2019 throat and resting an arm over his body.</p>\n<p>Stiles was the first to wake, and by the time Derek got up, he was curled in close and using sticky notes to mark pages in the book he\u2019d bought from Nick. It took Derek a long time to get out of bed, if only because he not-so-secretly enjoyed curling up with his head on Stiles\u2019 thigh and letting Stiles absently stroke his hair.</p>\n<p>Nearly an hour went by before Stiles shut the book and dragged Derek out of bed to make coffee. A quick check on his phone let him know that Deej planned on coming over later, and so he texted the pack to see who had time to stop by around that time. While Stiles was in the shower, Derek put a pot on and attempted to tidy up his living room so it didn\u2019t look like a bunch of college kids crashed there constantly.</p>\n<p>Stiles came out dripping wet and in a tee shirt and briefs, shuffling his way towards the kitchen with a hand on the wall for support. Derek wandered into his room to grab Stiles\u2019 cane, coming out and propping it against the counter while Stiles sleepily poured himself a mug. After glancing down at his cane, Stiles peered up and gave Derek a tiny smile--grateful that Derek wasn\u2019t pressuring him into using it, but giving him the option all the same. This was only something Derek had learned over time, and he still forgot it on occasion.</p>\n<p>Shrugging, Derek leaned in for a quick kiss, licking at the taste of over-sweetened coffee on Stiles\u2019 lips before rubbing a hand down his back. \u201cDeej and the others will be here in a little while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmh,\u201d Stiles hummed, pressing into Derek\u2019s hand and twisting his head for another kiss. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t found anything yet, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Derek mumbled, nudging Stiles\u2019 temple with his nose and ignoring the urge to just grab Stiles and hug him tightly and never let go. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re coming over. We don\u2019t have much time, we need to look at other options.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d At least, Derek hoped it would be. What he had with Stiles was so new and raw that he really didn\u2019t want to mess it up any more with pack issues and all of the drama surrounding their current situation. Stiles mumbled incoherently into his mug, taking a deep gulp from it and then setting it down so he could turn in Derek\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what else is fine? <i>You</i>.\u201d Stiles leered. Derek barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes, shooting him a tiny smirk before dragging Stiles in. They had a couple hours to make out before the pack came over, anyway.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Isaac and Scott were the first to show up, raiding Derek\u2019s pantry and bickering over who would be the one to pick Allison up from work while her car was in the shop. Ivanna came next, with Deej and Nick trailing in behind her looking like two children caught stealing from the cookie jar.</p>\n<p>Or getting frisky in the car, if the stink of arousal and leather seats was something to go by.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, brainstorming?\u201d Stiles offered as the pack settled in the living room. He plopped down next to Derek, elbowing him until Derek lifted his arm and settled it over Stiles\u2019 shoulders. Stiles\u2019 lip twitched to hide a smug grin as he made himself comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you find anything in the book?\u201d Deej ventured, leaning forward so that his elbows were resting on his knees, face pensive. Ivanna peered up from her sketchbook, thumbing her pencil. They both deflated when Stiles shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cBasically, like... even <i>if</i> we could give Deej her alpha status, all Jen has to do is kill him to get it back. I mean, no offense dude, but if your mom killed your dad for it... I\u2019m not so sure there\u2019s anything stopping her from killing her son, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t even cringe at the bluntness of Stiles\u2019 words. Years of fighting and dealing with life-and-death situations had numbed all of them far too much to sugar coat the truth. Deej looked sickened and Ivanna reached out to touch his arm in a familial gesture of comfort.</p>\n<p>Nick stood, scrubbing his hands through his hair and making small noises like he wanted to speak but couldn\u2019t find the right words. Deej\u2019s eyes flickered up to watch him for a moment before they fell to the floor. Derek knew exactly what Deej was going through, the trepidation and fear that came from being powerless against family.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt all boils down to you,\u201d he said softly, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. \u201cI know she\u2019s your family, I know you love her, but she\u2019s hurting you and everyone around you. Can you live with that for the rest of your life?\u201d</p>\n<p>Met with silence, Derek continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your mom, it\u2019s your sister and your aunt. That\u2019s a lot of family to lose in one day...\u201d <i> I would know</i>, was what Derek wanted to add on, but kept himself in check. Stiles\u2019 hand curled around his knee, squeezing tight. It was such a small gesture--but it was something Derek never had after his family had died. Derek pulled Stiles in, taking comfort in the warm press of his body and the closeness of a mind that knew him more intimately than anyone else alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s more back home,\u201d Ivanna said quietly, fiddling with her pencil. \u201cSome of Jen\u2019s betas and a few pack members from before my uncle died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre they loyal to Jen?\u201d Derek asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome are,\u201d Deej frowned, \u201cenough that they wouldn\u2019t be okay with me as the alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>If things weren\u2019t complicated before, this added a whole new level of messy to the situation.</p>\n<p>Scott made a small noise in the back of his throat, sitting up from where he and Isaac had mostly been observing from the loveseat. \u201cAre there any other packs that can help you out? Maybe if you have backup when you get there, your mom\u2019s betas won\u2019t fight back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej let out a soft sigh, leaning back and then sitting up again before he rubbed at his neck and shrugged, peeking up wearily at Scott. \u201cHonestly? The only pack that would take my side would be yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles blurted, before Derek even had the chance to turn them down. He shifted under Derek\u2019s arm, sitting up with a grunt as everyone\u2019s eyes focused on him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry dude, but no. We\u2019re a <i>tiny</i> pack, with three humans and a whole town to look after. We would love to help you, but do you have any idea how much planning that would take? How much time we\u2019d need to get the resources?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut--\u201d Scott began, only to have Derek cut him off with a sharp gesture.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles is right,\u201d he agreed, remembering a few too many times where they\u2019d run into battle unprepared. \u201cTwo packs fighting is guaranteed losses on both sides. We\u2019re on even grounds with this pack, and chances are that they\u2019re going to be ready for a fight when they feel the alpha power shift to Deej anyway. If we had more time, maybe we could help...but as it is, Lydia and Jackson are out of town and that leaves us down two pack members. I can\u2019t risk it... <i>we</i> can\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...\u201d Deej\u2019s breath hitched, eyes falling to look at his hands. He squeezed his fingers together, knuckles turning white until Nick reached over to place a hand over them. \u201cI get it, man. We\u2019ll think of something.\u201d Deej took in a deep breath, nodding once and exhaling. \u201cI\u2019m gonna step outside for a minute. This is a lot to take in, you know?\u201d He stood, brushing his palm over Nick\u2019s head and then making his way towards the balcony at the back of Derek\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p>The worst part was that Derek <i>wanted</i> to help Deej and Ivanna out, but his hands were tied. It wasn\u2019t safe enough for them to run into this blind. Derek had enough near-death experiences with the pack to know when to cut his losses. It might paint his pack in a bad light, but Derek couldn\u2019t care less when it meant that Stiles and the others were alive and well because of his choices. He\u2019d learned from most of his mistakes back when the pack was still in high school.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles turned, giving Derek wiggle of his eyebrows and jerking his head towards the balcony. Derek didn\u2019t need to be a genius to realize Stiles wanted him to bond with Deej over alpha-things and losing family members.</p>\n<p>Deej was leaning against the railing, watching the traffic on the street below when Derek came out. His scent was sharp with a heavy, fear-thick anxiety. Derek didn\u2019t even have to try and force himself to be conversational because the second he stood next to Deej, the younger man was rushing his words out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m freaking <i>out</i>, dude. I don\u2019t want to be the fucking alpha! I couldn\u2019t even handle assistant manager at my old job! I... I can\u2019t let Ivanna do it either because she\u2019s got a harder time with being in charge than I do...\u201d Deej trailed off, kicking his toe gently against the railing. There was so much of himself that Derek saw in Deej, it was almost terrifying. He was what Derek might have become had Kate and the fire never happened--naive, full of hope, and afraid of the world he wanted so desperately to face head-on.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of options,\u201d he pointed out, joining Deej in leaning against the balcony rails.</p>\n<p>California was a nice place to live compared to a lot of other states. The back of Derek\u2019s apartment faced west, the road below shaded by rows of palms that rustled with the late afternoon breeze. Clouds were dotting the sky in fat puffs, rolling slowly overhead and keeping the sun half-shrouded from view. Derek came out onto the balcony a lot when he was feeling particularly overwhelmed or just melancholy. The atmosphere was relaxing, air warm and the ambiance of the road below almost drowned out by the gentle clinking of the wind chime Allison had hung up in the corner as a housewarming gift years before.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t long before Deej spoke again, absently watching two squirrels chase one another along the trunk of a cedar tree down the road. \u201cWhat am I gonna do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek had absolutely no idea what they were going to do. This was a situation that needed weeks of planning and they had less than two days to figure something out. No matter what they did, people were going to get hurt, and Deej was going to hate himself afterwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy family died when I was fifteen.\u201d Derek began, \u201cit was my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silently, Deej turned to watch him. Derek had to keep his eyes focused on some point in the distance, unable to face the expressions that might cross Deej\u2019s face as he spoke. \u201cI thought I was in love. I wasn\u2019t, and she was a hunter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t stop there; he kept going, kept talking until his voice would have gone raw if he were human. He told Deej about Peter and Laura, about becoming the alpha and the power and mistakes that resulted. They watched the sun shift from midday to late afternoon, rays warm on their skin while Derek told Deej about Jackson and Lydia\u2019s immunity, about the alpha pack and so many other things they\u2019d encountered in the past.</p>\n<p>By the time Derek ran out of words to say, Deej was staring at Derek like he was an entirely different person. He looked bewildered, one hand still holding the balcony railing and the other one hanging limply at his side. \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Derek scowled, because he was pretty sure that he just spent the past hour explaining exactly that.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you keep going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody had bothered to ask Derek that. Stiles and Scott had always accepted Derek as stubborn, and the rest of the pack had never really known him as anything other than the alpha. It was a little jarring to realize in that second that he honestly had no idea how he\u2019d made it through the first year coming back to Beacon Hills--or even before that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d he admitted, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die... to find out if I would have to face my family again after everything I had done to them. After a while, though, I had more reasons--but in the beginning, it was because I was afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently Derek\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t the one Deej was looking for, because his frown deepened until he looked just like Stiles did when he opened the fridge to find emptiness. Derek shrugged, \u201cit\u2019s okay to be scared, and it\u2019s okay to not know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said, hoping that maybe simplifying what he meant would make it easier to understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem to know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Deej pointed out softly. Derek snorted, unable to help himself from thinking about Stiles and how years of skirting around one another had gotten them stuck in this weird pseudo-relationship that Derek had no idea how to handle.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as much as you\u2019d think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej gave him a crooked, forced smile before sighing and pushing himself off of the railing and into a stand. \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he confessed.</p>\n<p>Smirking, Derek reached out to clap Deej on the back and squeeze his shoulder. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t,\u201d he pointed out, guiding Deej back inside of the apartment. Isaac, Scott and Ivanna were on the couch watching what looked like Stiles\u2019 battered copy of Balto while Stiles and Nick were at the kitchen table. Derek didn\u2019t even have to listen hard to realize they were talking quietly to one another about magic or something of the like.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This happened every time they got together. It was hard to wrap his head around the differences between Nick and Stiles\u2019 magic, but there was apparently enough of a gap that the two could spend hours brainstorming techniques and meditation versus channeling energy into items. Stiles had spent a long time explaining to the pack that, while he could write sigils and brew concoctions and utilize mountain ash and a hundred other supernatural elements, he was only a conduit for magic and not a conductor. Nick, on the other hand, was like the outlet to Stiles\u2019 light bulb when it came to magic.</p>\n<p>Seeing Stiles talk so animatedly with Nick, gesturing wildly and grinning like a madman, Derek was more than happy to give into the impulse to make his way over to them. He bent down, slinging one arm around Stiles\u2019 stomach and burying his face into his throat--just because he could.</p>\n<p>Stiles set his palm on Derek\u2019s arm, patting it insistently. \u201cDude, <i>dude</i>. Nick made up his own spell last night!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmh?\u201d Derek murmured, breathing in deeply and enjoying the way Stiles smelled.</p>\n<p>Stiles squirmed, \u201cOkay, well it was an accident...but still! Maybe I could learn how to do it?\u201d The hesitance in Stiles\u2019 voice, and the way his heartbeat kicked up a notch was enough to set off alarm bells in Derek\u2019s head. Usually when Stiles got this excited about something, it was either dangerous or generally ill-advised.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was trying to share some thoughts with Deej... I went a little overboard,\u201d Nick muttered sheepisly, peering up at Deej and giving him a timid grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow overboard?\u201d Derek frowned, picking his head up.</p>\n<p>\u201cFive years worth of shared memories.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt went both ways,\u201d Deej chirped, matching Nick\u2019s smile with one of his own. The mere idea of tampering with Stiles\u2019 mind and memories any more than what\u2019s already been done was enough to make Derek shut down against the idea entirely. There was no way he\u2019d risk something as fragile as Stiles\u2019 mind against something volatile like a spell invented by accident.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stiffened, hand settling on Derek\u2019s arm around his stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s not for anyone but me--if I could just learn enough so that the blank-outs wouldn\u2019t be an issue--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re not messing around in your head.\u201d Too much was at stake for Derek to just sit by and let that happen.</p>\n<p>For a split second, Derek felt guilty about the crestfallen expression on Stiles\u2019 face, but it was gone when Stiles turned his despair around into anger. He pushed at Derek\u2019s hand, hissing, \u201cdo you have any idea how much that could help us? How many times have I lost minutes--hours!--during something important?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any idea how many ways it could go <i>wrong</i>?\u201d Derek countered, settling one hand on the back of Stiles\u2019 chair and the other on Stiles\u2019 shoulder to keep him from getting up in a fit if pique. \u201cYou can\u2019t cast magic, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can try!\u201d Stiles protested--and that was what really set Derek off. All the times Stiles had \u2018tried\u2019 something that had resulted in injuries or deaths was too high a number for Derek to feel at all safe about any of this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to risk that!\u201d Derek cried, louder than he\u2019d intended. Stiles jerked like Derek\u2019s words had burned him and Derek had to bite the inside of his cheek not to say something he\u2019d regret. Instead, Derek stood up and gestured for Stiles to follow him out of the room. At first, it looked like Stiles was going to protest and demand they hash out the argument in front of everyone else, but he soon sighed and stood up to follow Derek to the bedroom.</p>\n<p>Derek shut the door while Stiles made himself comfortable on the bed. Someone in the living room had courteously turned up the volume on the television to give them some semblance of privacy, and Derek was grateful for it.</p>\n<p>Stiles crossed his arms, sitting on the edge of the bed and looking more and more agitated by the second. \u201cNow you\u2019re telling me we have a way around what\u2019s wrong with me and you don\u2019t want to do it? What, do you like me broken?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was typical of Stiles to hit below the belt when he was angry, and Derek wasn\u2019t going to rise to the bait. He scowled, arms crossing to mimic Stiles\u2019 pose until Stiles sagged the tiniest bit from his defiant posture. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cI know that\u2019s not what you meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a sigh, Derek strode over to the bed to sit beside Stiles. \u201cIf I could take it all back--if I could go back in time and stop you from ever taking Scott out into the woods that night,\u201d Stiles cringed and Derek continued on, \u201cI would do it. I never wanted you to go through any of this... I didn\u2019t want it to happen to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Stiles said softly, enough that Derek had to look over at him in confusion. The corner of Stiles\u2019 mouth twitched up into a smile. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do it because you\u2019d lose all of us. You wouldn\u2019t do it because you don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>It stung, because it was the truth, and Derek didn\u2019t want to admit it. Sometimes Stiles said things that were too close to home--to Derek\u2019s heart--for him to handle. He pursed his lips, teeth clenching for a moment before he quietly admitted, \u201cI\u2019d rather be alone than know it\u2019s my fault you use that cane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that was my own fault,\u201d Stiles interjected knowingly. \u201cYou know the whole \u2018I\u2019m going to hunt a vampire nest, peace out bro\u2019 ? I wasn\u2019t even in the state. how is that your fault?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek barely shrugged before Stiles was reaching for something along the side of the bed and coming back with his spare cane. Derek thought Stiles was going to get up and storm out of the room with it, but instead, Stiles just used the rune-etched end of the cane to thwack Derek in the shin. Derek jerked--mostly in surprise and a little bit in \u2018ow, that hurt\u2019, and Stiles did it again.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop with the guilt complex, dude!\u201d Stiles cried, hitting Derek right under the kneecap. \u201cStop!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grabbed the cane, wrenching on it to try and pull it away from Stiles. Even with werewolf strength, Stiles managed to hold on enough that he was jerked forward and into Derek\u2019s body. Derek dropped the cane so that he could reach out and steady Stiles, chests pressed together and Stiles\u2019 good leg half on top of Derek\u2019s. Stiles hesitated for a moment, and then let go of the cane to cup Derek\u2019s jaw. His thumb brushed the high point of Derek\u2019s cheek, tracing down into the hollow. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget things,\u201d he mumbled, nail gently scraping the swell of Derek\u2019s lower lip. Derek\u2019s heart thundered in his chest, skin tingling from that single touch.</p>\n<p>Stiles frowned, other hand running his fingers through Derek\u2019s hair in a gentle petting motion. \u201cSometimes I wake up from a lapse and I wonder if what\u2019s between us is real or if I just wanted it so bad that my head made all that crap up at the bookstore to fill in the gaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you.\u201d Derek grabbed Stiles\u2019 hand, pulling it from his face and kissing the heel of his palm. \u201cI always do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do, don\u2019t you?\u201d Stiles muttered thoughtfully, eyes bright and full of a hundred emotions Derek couldn\u2019t begin to categorize. So instead, he kissed Stiles and hoped that would be good enough.</p>\n<p>With a tiny noise coming from Stiles that was smothered between their lips, Derek pulled Stiles in, wanting to get as close as possible. They didn\u2019t kiss for very long before Stiles was wrenching back and shaking his head. \u201cWait, no. This has nothing to do with you stopping me from doing that spell,\u201d he panted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if you lose all of your memory instead? It\u2019s not exactly stable,\u201d Derek protested, \u201cand you won\u2019t be getting your memories back, will you? You\u2019ll just be sharing with me or someone else. It\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than not knowing! You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have just this blank <i>nothingness</i> where something belongs!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek knew this was an argument that would take days to resolve--days he didn\u2019t exactly have on hand at the moment. He sighed, shaking his head. \u201cCan we talk about this later? After the Turners leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah...\u201d Stiles sagged, pulling away and dragging his hands through his hair. \u201cSorry--I just--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Derek assured, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater.\u201d Stiles confirmed.</p>\n<p>They returned to the living room and a handful of expectant faces. Stiles shook his head, \u201cwe have other things to deal with... like Deej\u2019s mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to kill her, huh?\u201d Deej asked, voice cracking near the end and lips twisting into a grimace.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah... and from the sound of it,\u201d Stiles sat down on the arm of the couch, holding his foot out and stretching it, \u201cit\u2019s not just your mom that you\u2019ll have to kill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s Amber and Kylie, and then the betas back home,\u201d Derek countered, \u201cwhich means the second the alpha status changes hands to yo, they\u2019ll know. I doubt all of them would accept you as their alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll think of something,\u201d Stiles blurted vehemently. \u201cJust because we can\u2019t get involved, doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t help in other ways. We might be able to hash out a plan or something--adamantly, sometimes you have to wait for the right moment, anyway. If we can just get everyone\u2019s guard down for an attack--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat only takes care of the three of them.\u201d Derek snapped, agitation rising at the mere thought of any sort of pack dispute. \u201cAs soon as he and Ivanna go home, they\u2019re going to have at least half a pack to deal with. He\u2019ll be a new alpha still getting used to his powers-- there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be able to take on the rest of his pack.\u2019</p>\n<p>Stiles opened his mouth, no sounds escaping before he finally grunted in frustration and slid down to sit on the couch proper. \u201cWe have time to figure something out. No rush, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej looked ready to throw up all over himself, face pale as Nick rubbed his back reassuringly. He whimpered, hiding his face in his hands like a man accepting death.</p>\n<p>Isaac, squished in the recliner with Scott, crossed one leg over the other and asked, \u201cwhat if we went back with them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek crossed his arms, \u201cthey\u2019ll know the second Deej becomes the alpha. Us walking through that door would be like walking into a trap. I\u2019m not risking anyone\u2019s lives when we could be easily outnumbered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we just sit here and do nothing?!\u201d Scott cried, throwing his arm out and gesturing to the group as a whole.</p>\n<p>If there was any other option, Derek would be open to it--but there wasn\u2019t. He sighed, \u201cWe meet them for dinner tonight. Maybe we can come up with some kind of truce.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least a truce could buy them some time. It was already established that Derek was with Stiles--so it wasn\u2019t like things could get much worse.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>If things got any worse, Derek was pretty sure there was going to be bloodshed. The entire dinner was a mess of backhanded comments from Jen, Amber ignoring Stiles completely, and Kylie \u2018accidentally\u2019 spilling things or kicking Stiles under the table for the majority of the evening.</p>\n<p>The meal had started with Scott, Allison and Boyd (Isaac busy with work and Erica studying for an exam at home) but ended with just Derek and Stiles. The main reason for that was mostly Derek\u2019s judgment to send them home when half the things coming from Jen and Amber\u2019s mouths had everyone ready to lunge across the table and tear someone\u2019s face off.</p>\n<p>After dessert--which was really Stiles forcing Derek to split a sundae with him while Kylie glowered at him from across the table--they headed outside of the restaurant. Stiles was the one to suggest meeting up at the preserve, because the sheer multitude of people surrounding them at dinner made it hard to get any type of serious conversation done.</p>\n<p>The Hale house had been torn down and reconstructed into a small cottage the year prior after some serious pressuring from most of the pack. Beneath it was a small panic room that had only been used once so far, and the inside was furnished with the bare essentials. The area surrounding the land had been donated to a wildlife conservation center, which meant that very few people headed through the dense trees and underbrush anymore. Sometimes Derek would loan the cottage out for a weekend to a college student studying towards some form of nature degree, but for the moment, it was empty.</p>\n<p>Empty enough to be a neutral ground for two werewolf packs, at least.</p>\n<p>Derek let the Turners in first, hesitating when Kylie latched onto Stiles\u2019 arm and gave Derek a grin with far too many teeth. \u201cI think your hubby should show me around. It\u2019s been a while since I was here, who knows how much has changed!\u201d</p>\n<p>Considering they were in the middle of a forest nearly two miles from civilisation, it wasn\u2019t hard for Derek to see through her cheap lie He couldn\u2019t call her out on it, though, and Kylie knew it--if the smug twitch of her lips was anything to go by.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Stiles muttered, shrugging and exuding that pungent scent of anxiety that Derek knew well enough to catch onto the fact that most of it was forced. \u201cI mean, they did tear some stuff down for a nature trail. We could look at that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kylie squealed and dragged Stiles off before Derek could really stop her. He pulled his phone out, shooting Stiles a quick text.</p>\n<p>\u2018<i>don\u2019t turn ur back on her</i>\u2019</p>\n<p>Stiles answered with, \u2018<i>&lt;3</i>,\u2019 and that was satisfying enough for Derek to tuck his phone away.</p>\n<p>He sat Jen and the others down in the living room, nodding once to Deej and Ivanna before taking the chair directly across from Jen. They didn\u2019t talk about much, mostly small talk with Jen crinkling her nose at the furnishing and Amber fiddling with the throw sitting on the back of the old loveseat. It was a good ten minutes of them trying to pry into Derek\u2019s life indirectly before the ice was finally broken.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Amber began, \u201ca human? Little beneath you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour family always did seem pretty big on bloodlines. Didn\u2019t your uncle date a human woman, once? I hear that ended badly.\u201d Jen interjected, pursing her lips thoughtfully. \u201cWell, as bad as things can go when a human is weak and ends up getting themselves killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have to worry about it then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Derek said tightly, left hand curling into a fist. He counted to five, clenched, and then loosened his fingers with a soft exhale. \u201cI\u2019ve been with Stiles for years. He was there for me when I needed him. I can\u2019t say the same for you and your pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m sorry but your sister was a bitch. I couldn\u2019t exactly allow girls like that into our pack. All it would do would be to cause stress on all of us as a whole,\u201d Jen barked, covering up her insults with an instant, simpering smile. Derek could hear the sharp intake of breath from Ivanna, and knew the air was pretty much tense with the possibility of attack if he rose to the bait.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess it\u2019s understandable that having someone like my sister in your pack would have been hard on your self esteem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amber hissed through her teeth, moving like she was going to get out of her seat, but Jen reached a hand out to place it gently on her sister\u2019s knee. \u201cWell. You seem happy here with your little human. I suppose we should go and fetch Kylie, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>They filed out of the cottage, Deej lingering back to try and establish some sort of silent communication with Derek. Considering it had taken his own pack years to get simple gestures down, Derek had no idea what Deej was mouthing, or what the gesturing and eyebrow-wiggling meant. He shrugged, brushing past Deej and frowning upon realizing that Amber and Jen weren\u2019t heading anywhere. Kylie and Stiles\u2019 scent was all over the place--and, knowing Stiles, it was probably intentional.</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes, focusing as hard as he could to try and pick up the sound of any heartbeats nearby. There was a jogger a half mile away, and a family on a picnic at the edge of the nature trail, and Stiles and Kylie were almost indistinguishable from how far they must have been.</p>\n<p>When they found Stiles and Kylie, it was at the bottom of a small hill with Stiles standing in place while Kylie circled him like a predator. Derek wanted desperately to jump down there and interrupt before Kylie could sink her claws in or say something that could crack their already fragile relationship, but with Amber and Jen watching him closely, he knew they were waiting to see just how much he trusted his \u2018little human\u2019 to take care of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d Kylie laughed, \u201cyou can\u2019t even stand up on your own. You\u2019re a cripple--already broken and useless. What kind of mate could you be, looking like that? I mean, it\u2019s cute how you think you can help, but you really can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles barely flinched, leaning heavily on his cane with his thumb tapping impatiently against the curve of it while Kylie prattled on. After another minute, he sighed and shrugged. \u201cLook, lady. I\u2019m having trouble seeing the issue here. I mean, Derek loves me and here you are resorting to petty intimidation because nobody likes you and you\u2019re desperate. Gold star, you tried... but I\u2019d be an idiot to fall for that. You get me?\u201d</p>\n<p>The snarl that left Kylie was more animal than human. She lashed out, shoving Stiles so hard that he toppled over. If Derek hadn\u2019t been watching as closely as he was, he\u2019d have missed the way Stiles hesitated bracing himself before going limp and allowing Kylie to knock him over.</p>\n<p>If Stiles was good at one thing, it was the \u2018fake it \u2018til you make it\u2019 technique.</p>\n<p>Deej shifted like he was going to stand, and Derek held a hand out to stop him. Deej froze, looking at Derek like he\u2019d grown two heads, but Derek just made an aborted movement to let Deej know he needed to wait before jumping in.</p>\n<p>A strangled noise came from the clearing and Derek turned to see Stiles gasping for air as Kylie pressed her foot down against his throat. It sent off every alarm in Derek\u2019s head, but he also knew that Stiles could stop her at any moment. He was clutching his cane, hand shaking like he was waiting for something. Derek hoped desperately he was reading Stiles right after years of working with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t win points for originality,\u201d Stiles wheezed, laughing and then gurgling when Kylie pressed down even more.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think your love is so great?\u201d Kylie sneered.\u201cYou think that you\u2019re living some kind of fairytale romance?\u201d Snorting, Kylie twisted her foot a little and made Stiles groan in pain. \u201cI hate to break it to you, kid, but the Little Mermaid didn\u2019t get the prince, and neither will you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughed, wet and loud, and then wrenched his cane up. The click and clang of a hidden blade being released was so loud it was impossible to miss when Stiles drove the blade into Kylie\u2019s leg. He didn\u2019t stop when she started to scream, shoving and pushing until the limb was almost completely severed off--enough that it would take her a good while to heal.</p>\n<p>Ivanna hissed and Derek could tell that Amber and Jen were ready to leap forward and take Stiles\u2019 life if he did anything else to harm Kylie. They didn\u2019t, though, much to Derek\u2019s surprise.</p>\n<p>Stiles pushed himself up into a stand, limping to where Kylie was trying to hold her mutilated leg in place so it could heal properly. He brought the cane up, twirling it fast enough that some of the blood flecked off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was always more of a Disney guy myself.\u201d he explained, inspecting the blade and then grinning down at Kylie, \u201cwhy deal with the nitty gritty when you can have all the good stuff instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do to me?!\u201d Kylie screeched, leg smoking as it struggled to heal, blood still pumping sluggishly all over the forest floor.</p>\n<p>Stiles tilted his head a little bit, and then held the cane up so that the metal glinted in the light of the half-moon. \u201cDid you know if you use rowan as kindling for a flame, the sword you forge on it is basically the kill-all for like, half the things that go bump in the night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kylie howled and lunged forward. She was fast enough to take Stiles by surprise, fast enough that Derek could only watch in shock as her claws dug into the flesh and muscle of Stiles\u2019 shoulder. If Stiles hadn\u2019t jerked at the last moment, it would have been his heart.</p>\n<p>Derek howled, drowning out the pained wail from Stiles as he leapt forward. In four long strides, he was bodily slamming Kylie off of Stiles. Kylie yelped, claws scrambling at any part of Derek she could get to. Derek couldn\u2019t even feel it, too blinded by a sudden, encompassing rage that came from watching his pack get hurt. Hand around Kylie\u2019s throat, Derek threw her as hard as he could into the nearest tree, barking sharply and then snarling with all of his teeth showing. If she got up again, Derek wasn\u2019t going to be so merciful.</p>\n<p>\u201cKylie, that\u2019s enough!\u201d Jen\u2019s voice cut in over the haze of anger. Kylie sagged against the tree, eyes glowing blue and Stiles\u2019 blood dripping from her hand. The flesh of her leg was bubbling and hissing, struggling to heal where the blade had touched.</p>\n<p>She wasn\u2019t his priority, and that was why Derek ignored her in favor of turning and making his way back to Stiles. He reached out, one hand cupping Stiles\u2019 cheek and the other hovering near the still-bleeding wound on his shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>An answer wasn\u2019t immediate. Stiles was looking blankly past Derek\u2019s shoulder, skin pale and clammy like he was going into shock. Derek cursed, wrapping Stiles into a hug and hissing, \u201ccome on, Stiles. Stay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles jerked back, suddenly and wildly, and stumbled away from Derek like he\u2019d been burned. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek reached out for Stiles\u2019 injury with the intent to take his pain. Stiles moved out of his range.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m done. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The unbearable, ugly sensation of ice settling in the pit of Derek\u2019s stomach was enough for Derek to lose the words struggling to rise out of his throat. He floundered, reaching for Stiles again and shaking his head. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Sti--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even remember how we got here!\u201d Stiles cried hoarsely, body shaking.</p>\n<p>The memories, again. Derek should have known this would come back to bite him in the ass. Nothing ever stayed good for him. \u201cYou went for a walk with--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTelling me doesn\u2019t bring the memories back, dumbass!\u201d Stiles shrieked. Derek went utterly still, taken aback for a long moment. Stiles hadn\u2019t used petty insults on him since he was in high school.</p>\n<p>Deej came forward, holding his hands out like a peace offering. \u201cStiles, you\u2019re just running on adrenaline. It\u2019s okay, this is just a huge misunderstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowned, body tense and coiled tight like a spring about to burst. \u201cI understand pretty well, and I\u2019m done. I\u2019m tired of the pity parties, and I\u2019m tired of having to deal with all of the emotional baggage that comes from some guy who can barely wipe his own ass, let alone take care of an entire pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek croaked, \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grinned, but it was a blank, joyless smile. \u201cYou should go with them. I\u2019m sure they need you more than we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Derek pleaded, crossing over to Stiles and reaching out for him. \u201cDon\u2019t <i>say</i> that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of taking his words back, Stiles shakily stepped away from Derek. Sweat was beading along his forehead, frame swaying like he was struggling not to collapse from pain or fatigue.</p>\n<p>From behind them, Jen piped up, \u201ctired of being used as a ragdoll, honey?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 jaw twitched and derek struggled to find words but all he could think of was how this was his own fault, that he\u2019s the cause of his own heartache. He tried, softly saying, \u201cyou told me all of this was worth it. you--I thought we....\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe this was one time too many.\u201d Stiles cut in sharply, lips pursed and quivering.</p>\n<p>Derek was pretty sure the look on his own face was something akin to horrified. Stiles didn\u2019t even seem bothered by it at all as he cleared his throat and muttered, \u201cI think it would be better for all of us if you just left.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek forgot how to breathe. He forgot how to even blink, trapped staring at the cold look in Stiles\u2019 eyes. It felt like an eternity before he could break away, clearing the choked feeling out of his throat and backing up.</p>\n<p>He was already out of sight before Stiles\u2019 heartbeat changed at all--a single clench and stutter-- and Derek honestly didn\u2019t know if it was from regret ...or guilt for telling the truth.</p>\n<p>Jen and the others caught up to him quick enough, crowding in on all sides as they hustled him back towards Derek\u2019s property, where the cars were parked.</p>\n<p>With his mind whirling and his heart struggling to keep beating, Derek wasn\u2019t even listening to Jen\u2019s words until she grabbed his shoulder and forced him to stop walking.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you hear me, Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jen smiled, a pathetic, pitying one. \u201cI said it would be best if you left your things here when you came with us. It helps if you don\u2019t have any reminders of the past when joining a new pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, right.</p>\n<p>Stiles didn\u2019t just break up with him for the sake of breaking up.</p>\n<p>Stiles was <i>sending him away</i>.</p>\n<p>Kylie reached a hand out to pet Derek\u2019s back. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve you, anyway,\u201d she cooed.</p>\n<p>Derek snarled, gnashing his teeth at her. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he barked, feeling tense and on-edge enough to give into the temptation to kill her on the spot.</p>\n<p>\u201cKylie, why don\u2019t you help Deej and Ivanna pack up the hotel? I think we have a few loose ends to tie up here.\u201d Amber handed Kylie the keys to her car, motioning for Derek to come with Jen and herself towards the camaro.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave Stiles here,\u201d Derek protested, \u201cI was his ride.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amber turned, frowning. \u201cYour ex-fiance made it pretty clear that he\u2019d be perfectly happy with you leaving him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s phone chirped with an incoming text message and Derek couldn\u2019t stop himself from rushing to see it. Stiles did have a habit of speaking impulsively--there was a chance that--</p>\n<p>Amber snatched the phone from his hands, crushing it in her palm. \u201cSweetie, all the apologies in the world won\u2019t take back the things he said to you. You deserve to be with your kind, anyway. We\u2019re practically family, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jen nodded, watching as Kylie and the others drove off. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave tonight, since we got what we came for. Is there anything you need to get from your apartment? I mean, technically you\u2019re not engaged anymore... which means you have to come with us no matter what.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek thought about his clothes, about the things the pack helped him pick out for himself and for his home. He thought about his game consoles--but they were all ones that Stiles made him buy. There\u2019s also the books Lydia and Allison filled had his shelves with, and the comics from Scott and Isaac. He thinks about the posters on the walls that Erica spent two weeks covering his apartment with, and about the half-finished motorcycle that\u2019s been sitting in a storage unit. he and Boyd were fixing it up.</p>\n<p>Something was telling Derek he should stay--that he should talk to Stiles and figure out what was wrong and why Stiles had said those things. He was having a hard time trying to think of reasons to fix the situation when it would be so much easier to just give in. His head felt muddled, thoughts thick like molasses and difficult to sort through. The only real thing that felt clear to him was that Stiles didn\u2019t want him and that he should just go with the Turners.</p>\n<p>It was like a huge weight lifting off of his chest when Derek shrugged and said, \u201cno, not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Riding in a car packed full of people he didn\u2019t like should have been agonizing for each and every second. In reality, it passed like a muddled blur--broken only by Deej\u2019s disappointed looks and the occasional too-friendly touch from Kylie. For some reason, the entire situation felt surreal; like he was just watching everything happen from a distant dream. The ache in his chest felt like a dull burn, twisting and prodding occasionally, but easy enough to ignore. Every time Derek tried to think of reasons to go back, or even to think of why Stiles had acted so irrationally, it was like someone was pouring tar into his brain and gooping up his thoughts until there was nothing solid to focus on.</p>\n<p>They stopped for lunch at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Derek had a fish sandwich suggested to him by Jen, and then nearly spat it back out after remembering upon the first bite that he hated fish. He almost tried to order something else, but when Amber pointed out that it would take too long, he ended up nibbling on his fries while everyone else conversed cheerily around him. He felt like something was broken, but he had no idea what it was.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the Turner\u2019s home felt like finally reaching the prison he was sentenced to life in. There were at least five betas lounging here and there, most of them sniffing at Derek before dismissing his presence as unimportant. Deej had spent the last hour of the car ride texting with Nick, and he made a beeline for his room once they walked through the door.</p>\n<p>Jen pressed her hand against the back of Derek\u2019s shoulders, guiding him down the hall. \u201cYou\u2019ll be staying with Kylie. I mean, you\u2019re engaged, after all. No reason to keep you apart. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to get a jumpstart on some cubs, if you\u2019re feeling up to it. This has been a long day for you, so don\u2019t feel rushed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t know what to say, mostly because any time he tried to tell her how very much he did <i>not</i> want to make cubs with her daughter, his tongue became heavy and impossible to use. He ended up making a tiny noise of acknowledgement as she all but pushed him into Kylie\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>It was like a five year old had vomited rainbows all over the place. Nothing matched the way it should have, and Derek was pretty sure that some of the band posters on the wall were the same ones he\u2019d seen in the room of a pre-teen they\u2019d saved from a striga the year before. Derek had to take a second to just sit on the bed and breathe. He knew, somewhere deep inside, that this was so far out of his hands it was ridiculous. At the same time, no matter how badly Derek tried to remember why he\u2019d agreed in the first place, it was like someone kept re-directing his train of thought into stupid things like <i>why Kylie had a purple dust ruffle</i>.</p>\n<p>The more Derek tried to think of ways to reverse the situation he was in, the more nauseous he felt and the more his head began to hurt. It wasn\u2019t long before he had a crippling migraine with absolutely no progress in organizing his thoughts. He felt exhausted, enough that sleep sounded like a much better idea than trying to escape.</p>\n<p>Derek was out before his head even hit the pillow.</p>\n<p>When he woke up, it was to the weight of a body on top of his own. It wasn\u2019t Stiles\u2019 weight--Stiles always favored his injured side in everything he did--but someone else\u2019s. Derek cracked an eye open, gut burning in horror at the sight of Kylie on top of him in nothing but a sheer night gown, breasts visible through the material. She was fumbling with the fly of his jeans, one hand rubbing slowly up his hip and then down his thigh like she was trying to get his body to react the way she wanted it to.</p>\n<p>Unthinking, Derek howled and threw her off of him. She went tumbling to the ground in a heap of limbs and shrieking. Derek leapt to his feet, clarity of mind hitting him in a rush. He had no idea why he ever agreed to any of this; why he would leave Stiles and the pack behind because of a stupid argument. It was so unlike anything he\u2019d ever done before that Derek\u2019s chest ached with shame. There was no excuse for his behavior, not even if Stiles\u2019 words <i>had</i> been true. Derek knew Stiles, and he knew that Stiles said shit without thinking. He also knew that Stiles would never genuinely want anyone to leave without a good, solid reason. Hating Derek was not one of those reasons--not when they\u2019d been kissing and happy in bed just that morning.</p>\n<p>No. Derek <i>hadn\u2019t</i> been thinking. That was exactly the problem. He\u2019d felt spellbound the entire time--which was exactly what must have happened. They\u2019d been so focused on their immediate problems that they hadn\u2019t thought to watch out for something as underhanded as a spell being cast by someone in the Turner pack.</p>\n<p>Hurriedly getting his pants back on, Derek snarled when Kylie tried to shuffle back over to him. \u201cGet away,\u201d he snapped, teeth bared and eyes flashing in warning. Kylie hesitated, and that was enough for Derek to turn on his heel and march out of the room. Kylie followed, shouting obscenities and practically clawing at his arm to try and drag him back into her room. Derek shoved her, watching as she stumbled for a moment and then caught herself against the wall.</p>\n<p>Satisfied, Derek continued down the hall. He made his way through the living room, ignoring the way Jen and Amber practically leapt to their feet in shock. Derek was going home--even if he had to run the entire way there.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek?\u201d Jen asked, wary. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Derek growled, shoving one of the betas aside.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlex!\u201d Kylie howled, \u201cAlex, get out here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving!\u201d Derek repeated when two more betas tried to block his exit. \u201cGet out of my way. You did something to me, didn\u2019t you? You did something to Stiles, too!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Derek, \u201c Amber approached, hands out like she was trying to calm a skittish animal. Derek felt caged, the hair on the back of his neck rising like hackles and his nails turning to claws. Amber tried to set a hand on his arm and he gnashed his teeth at her until she backed up. He\u2019d fight his way out or die trying.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, you\u2019re just having some anxiety about being in a new place, is all,\u201d Jen assured, shaking her head. \u201cWe all get like that, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opened his mouth to protest, except the words never came out when he was hit with a rush of vertigo. He shook his head, trying to dispel the sensation. \u201cNo,\u201d he breathed, vision spotty, \u201cno I\u2019m not. I want... I want to go home.\u201d That\u2019s what he wanted. He\u2019d almost forgotten. That longing for familiar faces and scents was enough to give Derek the energy to hiss, \u201cI want my pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are your pack, honey,\u201d Jen said. Derek knew she was wrong, knew because his stomach hurt just thinking about it. He knew, but at the same time, he felt confused because part of him was saying that her words were true. Part of him was screaming at him to listen to her; that she was his alpha and that this was his new home. He glanced around, taking in the sight of Deej and Ivanna hovering, of Alex watching with Kylie holding his arm like a lifeline. These strangers were meant to be his new family, weren\u2019t they?</p>\n<p>\u201cNo... no, I have one back in Beacon Hills,\u201d Derek muttered, hand coming up to press against his temple in an attempt to dispel the headache that had started to settle right between his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey abandoned you, Derek,\u201d Jen reminded him sharply. Her words stung like a knife digging in the space right under his heart. Derek forgot how to breathe, forced to listen as she continued. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? They don\u2019t want you anymore. <i>We</i> want you, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>That seemed... right... they did say cruel things to him. Not only that, but it had been so hard to get them to be pack in the first place. They were probably happier as a pack without him to interfere. Stiles deserved so much better--someone who wouldn\u2019t cause him so much pain. He shook his head, eyes closing to try and block out the image of Alex, Deej, and the rest of the betas watching him like he was some kind of joke.</p>\n<p>A tiny, pathetic noise of defeat came from somewhere deep inside Derek. It was like an invisible hand had wrenched the sound from him. He didn\u2019t even know why he\u2019d wanted to leave in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Derek admitted quietly, rubbing his aching head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie,\u201d Jen grinned, reaching out to pat him on the shoulder, \u201cwe all get like that sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deej, from where he stood next to Ivanna, shook his head. He looked ready to lunge across the room and strangle Derek, but Derek had no idea why. They were pack, and pack loved each other.</p>\n<p>Kylie unclamped herself from Alex\u2019s side, rushing over and clinging to Derek with a happy sound. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you changed your mind!\u201d She smacked a kiss against his cheek, and it left Derek feeling like ants were crawling under his skin. He wanted to pull away, but his arm was heavy like lead in her grasp. She tugged him back towards her bedroom and Derek\u2019s feet moved on their own, following her every step. Things felt disjointed and fuzzy around the edges, like his body had officially been programmed to autopilot against his will.</p>\n<p>With a gentle push, Kylie had Derek falling back against the bed so that she could clamber on top of his body with a happy purr. Derek wanted to scream and push her away, but he couldn\u2019t find the energy or motivation to do either. She kissed him, open and wet, and it felt disgusting. Her tongue was slick when it pried Derek\u2019s lips open, wriggling inside while she pushed him harder into the mattress. Derek hated the way her claws dug into his chest, hated how much he didn\u2019t want this but couldn\u2019t stop her. He felt sick to his stomach, felt guilt that told him this was betrayal in the highest form. Derek didn\u2019t understand why, because he knew they were engaged and that meant he should be enjoying it and not hating it.</p>\n<p>Kylie\u2019s teeth bit into his mouth as she smiled, hands moving to start tugging at his pants again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re into rape now, huh, sis?\u201d Deej\u2019s voice came from the doorway. Kylie jerked her head up, hissing and curling her hands into fists. Derek wondered why his body felt like it was made entirely of immovable mass, limbs heavy when he tried to at least sit up while Kylie growled and cursed at her brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of your business, Deej. Besides, he wants it--don\u2019t you, Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t, not really, not when he could barely move his body other than to blink and breathe. He tried to say no, to tell her this, but he found himself nodding, much to Kylie\u2019s delight. She gave Deej a smug look, thumb flicking open the button to Derek\u2019s fly for emphasis.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s under a compliance spell, Kyls. What do you <i>think</i> he\u2019s going to say?\u201d Deej hissed, jaw flexing like it was taking all of his willpower not to howl and scream instead. Kylie snorted, dragging down the zipper in a slow, exaggerated manner. She shrugged, watching Derek and studiously ignoring her brother\u2019s judgmental staring.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged, so it\u2019s not like it matters.\u201d She said dismissively, palming Derek roughly through his boxers. Derek made a pained noise, feeling crowded and violated in so many ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Deej said faintly, \u201cI\u2019m seriously going to get mom in on this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom killed dad,\u201d Kylie snapped, body going tense before she forced herself to relax and resume groping Derek, fingers tracing the outline of his flaccid cock in hopes of getting some sort of reaction. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to care what happens to my <i>mate</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKylie, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Deej stepped into the room, spreading his arms out in a pleading gesture. \u201cDon\u2019t be like her, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look that crossed Kylie\u2019s face was similar to the one a person would make when smelling or seeing something particularly foul. Her nose crinkled as she sneered, but her hand blessedly drew back. She climbed off of Derek\u2019s body, adjusting her nightgown and puffing her chest out. Deej grimaced, glancing away and looking particularly sickened at the sight of his sister\u2019s nearly-exposed breasts.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t do it today, doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen eventually.\u201d Kylie said stiffly, fixing her hair and brushing her bangs from her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank, Kyls, I mean it.\u201d Deej gave her a smile, but it was answered with an annoyed eye roll from Kylie before she brushed past him and out the door.</p>\n<p>Derek struggled to push himself up, breathing labored and head roaring in pain. Deej must have noticed, because he quickly said, \u201cget up,\u201d and any resistance Derek had previously met was gone as his body hauled itself into a sitting position on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cFix your pants.\u201d Deej added, watching Derek\u2019s hands mindlessly move to button his fly. He was scowling deeply, brows pinched together and making a crinkle appear in his forehead. \u201cYou know what\u2019s wrong, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Trying to talk was difficult when his mouth felt like it had been sealed shut. Deej sighed and added, \u201canswer me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nodded. \u201cA spell--a strong one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grimacing, Deej shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans and rocked back on his heels. \u201cI wish I could stop it, dude. I\u2019m so fucking sorry. I had no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019 </i> Derek wanted to tell him, but he couldn\u2019t control his mouth enough to get the words out. Instead, he stared and hoped his face didn\u2019t look too angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, I swear,\u201d Deej promised. \u201cSeriously, things will get better. Just give it time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wanted to laugh in his face--or spit in it, he wasn\u2019t sure. Until now, Derek had been under the impression that Deej was on their side...but his confidence in the other werewolf was starting to get weaker with each passing moment. It was hard to really be sure of anything when his mind was stuck in a permanent state of slow fuzziness.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet some sleep,\u201d Deej suggested. The only problem was that, with Derek spellbound, it was more of a command than anything. Derek was helpless to stop his body laying itself across the bed, or his eyes closing, or his mind shutting off completely until he was dragged into a sense of nothingness.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Waking up was more gradual than anything, like someone had started to turn up the dimmer switch on Derek\u2019s consciousness. He felt Kylie\u2019s body pressed up against his side, her scent thick in his nostrils. To someone else, she might have smelled good, but to Derek it was more sickening than anything. He missed Stiles\u2019 scent, missed the smell of his apartment and the pack. Hell, he was even starting to miss Allison\u2019s hugs the more he was stuck settling for Kylie\u2019s embrace. Anything was better than this place--full of foreign smells and creaky rooms.</p>\n<p>They way his eyes burned, Derek knew tears were welling in them right before he blinked and forced them to trickle down his cheeks. He hadn\u2019t felt this miserable and hopeless in <i>years</i>. The only upside was that the spell had worn off enough for him to be able to wipe at his face. It took a second, but Derek managed to push himself out of bed and pad silently out of the bedroom.</p>\n<p>The first thing Derek did was find the bathroom. After taking care of business and washing his face, he went out into the living room to see that the first light of dawn was just starting to trickle in through the blinds. Deej was at the kitchen table, bags heavy under his eyes as he tapped away furiously at his laptop. He sniffed once, going utterly still before jerking his head up to stare at Derek with wide eyes.</p>\n<p>Derek opened his mouth to say <i>something</i>, but Deej quickly brought a finger to his lips and then gestured for Derek to come over. Just the tiny bit curious, Derek obeyed. Deej moved the laptop enough so Derek could see the screen, and his heart nearly stopped in his chest at the sight of Stiles\u2019 username up in a chat window.</p>\n<p>Typing, Deej wrote out for Derek, <i>too many people here. someone might wake up and hear us talking. we can type for now, they won\u2019t suspect anything. i\u2019m on the computer all the time, anyway.</i></p>\n<p>It made sense, actually. Derek felt a little impressed--mostly because it wasn\u2019t something he would have thought of so easily. He nodded and Deej erased his last line and typed again.</p>\n<p>\n<i>do you feel fully in control yet?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Derek took a second to consider leaving, just getting up and walking out the door and going back home, but as soon as he tried to actually take a step towards the front door, his head started to ache and his thoughts started to blur. He shook his head, taking a seat next to Deej and telling himself he would stay--if only to get rid of the migraine that was starting to develop.</p>\n<p>Frowning, Deej nodded at him and then started to type into the chat window.</p>\n<p>\n<b>deejadoodle:</b>\n<i>Derek\u2019s up. He\u2019s here, but the spell is still keeping him from leaving.</i>\n</p>\n<p>The reaction from Stiles was almost instantaneous. Derek had forgotten how fast he typed, but it was easy to remember when the chat window started pinging again and again as Stiles practically blew it up with messages.</p>\n<p>\n<b>thestilinsking:</b>\n<i>DEREK</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i><b>thestilinsking:</b>DEREK ARE YOU OKAY?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i><b>thestilinsking:</b>I\u2019M SO SORRY. I WASN\u2019T SAYING THOSE THINGS.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i><b>thestilinsking:</b>LIKE IM PRETTY SURE YOU KNOW THAT NOW BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT ANYWAY</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i><b>thestilinsking:</b>I DIDN\u2019T MEAN ANY OF IT. IT WASNT ME</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i><b>thestilinsking:</b>YOU\u2019RE OURS. THEY CANT HAVE YOU, REMEMBER?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Derek knew he was grinning like an idiot. His cheeks were aching and his chest was swelling with a combination of relief and elation to know that Stiles was okay, and that nothing he\u2019d said had been true. Deej cooed quietly, and then typed up a message to Stiles.</p>\n<p><b>deejadoodle:</b> he\u2019s smiling. i think he\u2019s blushing. aw that\u2019s adorable. can i keep him?</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 answering message came back immediately.</p>\n<p><b>thestilinsking:</b> NO.</p>\n<p>A window appeared, flashing <i> the stilinsking wants to video you</i> like a beacon. Deej flailed, rushing to type up a message to Stiles in the chat.</p>\n<p><b>deejadoodle:</b> can\u2019t talk, pack will hear.</p>\n<p><b>thestilinsking:</b> turn off the sound. I just want to see him, ok??</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Deej hissed, lip twitching to hide a smile as he hit the mute button and accepted the call.</p>\n<p>The second Derek saw Stiles\u2019 face, he thought his heart was going to explode into a thousand pieces. There wasn\u2019t even any reason, other than the fact that he was seeing <i>Stiles</i> and he was okay and smiling and happy to see Derek alive. Allison, Isaac and Scott were in the background, all of them hovering so they could each see the screen, and it helped fix a little bit of the broken pieces inside of Derek to know that his pack was there for him. Unthinking, he reached out to take the laptop from Deej, pulling it in close so that he could see everyone properly.</p>\n<p>Stiles waved, typing, <i>hey there big guy. miss me?</i></p>\n<p>It took Derek a second of hunt-and-peck to respond with, <i>yes</i>, because he did.</p>\n<p>Though he tried to hide it, Stiles practically preened at the knowledge--Derek could tell with the way his shoulders twitched back and his right eyebrow twitched up.</p>\n<p><b>thestilinsking:</b> can you hold on just a little longer? we\u2019ve got a way to fix all this.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the look on Derek\u2019s face was enough for Stiles to add, <i> we\u2019re coming for you. but we think that guy\u2019s magic will just send us right back home if we don\u2019t do this right.</i></p>\n<p>Derek normally wasn\u2019t a man of too many words, and it was only worse with something as slow as inexperienced typing on a keyboard. He nodded, and sent Stiles, <i>ok</i>, to let him know he understood.</p>\n<p><b>thestilinsking:</b> we miss you, man.</p>\n<p>Stiles brought his hands up, making a little heart. It was pretty childish, but so much Stiles that Derek had to frown at how badly he wished he was back home--if only to crush Stiles into a stupid, suffocating hug. It was a far better option than being forced to chat with him over a muted video.</p>\n<p>Scott wiggled his way past Stiles, typing out a message while Stiles tried to un-usurp the laptop.</p>\n<p><b>thestilinsking:</b> we have a plan dont worry</p>\n<p><i>i hope so</i>, is what Derek typed back. Stiles was staring at the screen, frowning like he wanted to say something, when a rustling noise came from somewhere in the house. Someone was waking up.</p>\n<p>Deej grabbed the laptop back, dragging it towards himself to shoot off a message to Stiles that they had to cut the call short.</p>\n<p>Derek pressed in close, trying to get a last look at Stiles and his packmates before the video closed and Deej pulled up a random blogging website. He made a shooing motion at Derek, gesturing towards the coffee maker and wiggling his eyebrows meaningfully. Derek huffed, getting up and going to make a pot of coffee, as per Deej\u2019s silent suggestion.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t long before Amber was emerging from her room in a fluffy robe, hair a complete mess and her face looking like she was ready to kill kittens if they mewled at her wrong. She hip-checked Derek away from the coffee maker to pour herself a cup, ignoring his presence entirely. He took it in stride, shuffling towards the living room with his own mug and finding a tattered old recliner in one corner to settle himself in.</p>\n<p>He stayed there for most of the morning, entertaining himself with a musty-smelling copy of Moby Dick that had been used as more of a decoration than actual reading material. The Turner pack mostly mingled, some bickering and others ignoring everyone as they went about their daily routine. It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d re-read the same sentence for the fifth time after hearing Kylie and one of the betas getting into an argument over who stole who\u2019s hair brush that Jen finally struck up conversation with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Derek, sweetie...how long has it been since you became the alpha?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek kind of wanted to throw the book at her head, but he knew that would only end with Alex putting him under another spell to the point of near-unconsciousness. He grit his teeth, muttering, \u201ca while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jen\u2019s lips thinned, cheek twitching like she was biting the inside of it. \u201cI see... well, how many children do you hope to have?\u201d</p>\n<p>When he tried to say, \u2018none\u2019, it was like his lips sealed themselves together. He glanced around the room, catching Alex sitting innocently at the kitchen table and sipping at his tea. For a second, he glanced up to give Derek a tiny smile, winking and then going back to reading whatever was on his phone. The truth pushed itself out of Derek almost immediately after.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot,\u201d he blurted, \u201cI miss having a huge family. I want that again, even if I have to adopt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jen said breezily, \u201chopefully it won\u2019t come to that, will it? How was your first night here, by the way? I hope Kylie wasn\u2019t too rough on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, if the pack was here, Derek was pretty sure Stiles or at least Erica would be going after Jen with a lead pipe. They weren\u2019t, though, and all Derek could do was keep himself from snarling. Instead, he gave her a tight, impassive smile and shrugged in a way that couldn\u2019t be taken as particularly good or bad. Luckily, Jen seemed satisfied enough with that.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man, wanna play some games?\u201d Deej popped up from behind the couch, gesturing vaguely to the hallway where most of the bedrooms were. Derek was awful at most games--his only specialty were with the older consoles--but saying no was kind of difficult when Alex was nearby and ready to zap him with another compliance spell if need be.</p>\n<p>Deej must have noticed his indecision, because he reiterated with, \u201cI think you totally want to play,\u201d so that the little part of Derek still taken under by the last spell had him shrugging and standing. If he tried hard, Derek might have been able to resist, but he knew it wouldn\u2019t be worth the hassle when he was pretty much stuck in a nest of vipers with a viperine as his only friend.</p>\n<p>Turning on the console, Deej tossed Derek a controller and flopped back on the bed, gesturing for Derek to find a place to sit and get comfortable. Derek stood there awkwardly, wanting to throw the controller at Deej\u2019s face, but then Deej sighed and said, \u201csit down and play.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek did exactly that, despite his best efforts not to.</p>\n<p>He spent most of the time accidentally dying or getting killed in some ridiculous manner while Deej cackled and kept checking his phone like it was some sort of addictive drug. Derek wanted to ask if it was Stiles, but it was pointless to do so because the pack listened in on everything that went on. It was the fifth or sixth time that Deej pulled his phone out that he actually did something, and that was only to tuck his phone back in his pocket and whine, \u201cshit, dude, it\u2019s hot as fuck in here. Mind if I open the window?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek himself didn\u2019t feel hot, or even particularly warm, but he shrugged anyway. Deej grinned, getting up and clambering over to his bedroom window. Before he opened it, he turned and pressed a finger to his lips in a shushing motion. Derek stared, disbelief striking him dumb as Erica\u2019s blonde head popped up in the window as it opened up. She waved, hoisting herself inside and being immediately followed after by Isaac.</p>\n<p>The only sound in the room was the screaming of monsters on the television from the video game as Derek\u2019s betas hurried over and practically patted him down for injuries. Derek didn\u2019t even think, practically manhandling Erica into the tightest hug he could manage while Isaac returned to the window to help Allison climb in.</p>\n<p>She was in her usual hunter\u2019s suit--black boots, leather jacket and matching pants with fat pockets stuffed full of various weapons designed specifically for supernatural extermination. With her hair tied up in a tight bun, Allison tucked a few stray curls behind her ear and came over to give Derek a gentle squeeze on the shoulder and a kiss on the cheek.</p>\n<p>Stunned couldn\u2019t even begin to describe how Derek was feeling. It was almost like he was living in some kind of dream, his pack coming to save him and showering him with fond gestures in the process. Erica pulled away, reaching out to fluff up Derek\u2019s bangs before looking over at Deej.</p>\n<p>Deej was staring at his phone, three fingers held up as they counted down. When he brought down the last finger, the entire house shook violently with the sound of a deafening boom. Splintering wood and howling came from the living room, and then a bone-rattling roar exploded from close by. It was a roar Derek hadn\u2019t heard in quite some time.</p>\n<p>Stiles had brought that stupid yeti with him.</p>\n<p>The smile on Isaac\u2019s face was threatening to split his cheeks as he wolfed out and gave Derek a thumbs-up before wrenching Deej\u2019s bedroom door open and running out with an animalistic cry. Erica gave him a friendly slap on the ass, following after Isaac. Allison cocked her crossbow, looking at Derek expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Did you think we\u2019d just give you up so easily?\u201d She asked, laughing softly at the blank look Derek gave her in response.</p>\n<p>Another crash came from the living room, this one followed by Stiles\u2019 voice bellowing, \u201cRide like the wind, Jobo!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jobo gave an answering warble of yeti jibberish and smashed something. The sound of Stiles\u2019 voice was like a lure, dragging Derek to finally follow his betas out into the throng of chaos. There was complete madness going on, Stiles sitting on Jobo\u2019s shoulders while the beast grabbed members of the Turner back left and right and threw them around like they were ragdolls. Ivanna was nowhere to be seen, Deej quickly coming to stand at Derek\u2019s side. \u201cHoly shit, they went all out, dude.\u201d Deej whispered.</p>\n<p>A flash of white came from the corner of his eye and Derek turned to stare in numb disbelief as a unicorn reared up and kicked Kylie in the face. There were spatters of blood all over it\u2019s coat, horn dripping red as it galloped towards one of the Turner betas and impaled her through the chest with a loud whinny.</p>\n<p>Derek had no idea what the hell was going on.</p>\n<p>Alex was in the corner of the room, slowly being corralled in by Isaac and Erica, the both of them snarling and flexing their claws. He threw his hands up, blurting, \u201cwould you look at that? You just killed my paycheck. I think my job here is done,\u201d and disappearing with a loud crack of smoke.</p>\n<p>Just behind them, Amber fell to the ground, skin pale and lips blue as Nick stepped closer with both hands out--twisting his palms as a small vortex of air continued to pulse around her head and suffocate her.</p>\n<p>Next to Derek, Deej sighed, \u201che\u2019s so sexy when he uses his magic to kill my oppressive family members,\u201d and hopped over one of the dead betas on his way over to the mage\u2019s side. </p>\n<p>Boyd tore the throat out of another Turner beta, eyes glowing bright as he howled in triumph before bounding over to Scott\u2019s side and tackling Jen just as she knocked Scott to the ground. Erica pounced on Amber, taking advantage of the woman\u2019s weakened state to shove her clawed hand straight through Amber\u2019s chest and into her heart. Apparently, Nick had been distracted from his spellwork by Deej\u2019s very enthusiastic greeting kiss.</p>\n<p>Stiles, still perched on Jobo\u2019s shoulders with one hand buried into the yeti\u2019s long mane of hair, waved frantically at Derek. \u201cSweetums, I\u2019m so sorry about the delay! Traffic was <i>awful</i>!\u201d</p>\n<p>With the spell that had been keeping him complaint finally broken, Derek, of all things, could only stupidly say, \u201crush hour is pretty bad this time of day,\u201d and watch as Stiles\u2019 face lit up as he released a loud and delighted cackle. It was like the life had finally been breathed back into Derek\u2019s body, chest fit to burst with suffocating affection for this foolish, stubborn human that had somehow crawled under his skin and fit himself next to Derek\u2019s heart like a permanent fixture.</p>\n<p>Kylie\u2019s bloodcurdling screech of rage caused both of them to look over and see Allison on her back, using a small staff carved from rowan to strangle her. She clawed at Allison\u2019s arms, choking as the skin of her throat smoked and bubbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Stiles cried when Allison pulled a blade from the holster on her thigh. Allison hesitated and Stiles added, \u201cthis one\u2019s mine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, dude?\u201d Scott whined from where he was wrestling around with Jen. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some cheesy action movie!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t judge me--she tried to get nookie from my man.\u201d Stiles snapped, patting Jobo on the head. Jobo made a low rumble in her chest, lumbering over and plucking Kylie up like some sort of cheap toy, pulling Allison away and setting her back down before squeezing Kylie so hard that everyone could hear the snapping and crunching of her bones.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get away with it,\u201d Stiles said, watching as Kylie\u2019s enraged expression slowly turned into one of terror. Stiles ignored it, reaching for the gun tucked into his side and pulling it out. He flicked the safety off, lining up the shot and shooting her clean in the head. The bang was deafening, jarring the last of the betas into losing their concentration. Stiles tucked the gun away as Kylie went limp in Jobo\u2019s hand, life immediately gone out of her.</p>\n<p>Derek had almost forgotten how terrifying Stiles could be when he put his mind to something.</p>\n<p>Jobo let Kylie\u2019s body drop to the ground with a thud as Jen screamed and howled in enraged distress. The sound was cut off when Deej jumped on her distracted state to run his claws through her neck, killing her almost instantly. A hush went through the room as the last few betas reacted to the change of alphas, most of them backing down quickly while one tried to keep fighting and was killed by Isaac.</p>\n<p>Deej stared down at his hands, flexing his fingers as his eyes glowed red. He looked up, taking in a deep breath and looking to the last of his pack. \u201cI\u2019m the alpha, now,\u201d he said lowly.</p>\n<p>The seriousness was broken when Stiles howled in laughter, followed quickly by Scott and Allison as they dissolved into hysterics. Derek knew exactly why they were laughing, and had to keep from crossing his arms and pouting. That was <i>years<i> ago, and it wasn\u2019t like there was much else you could say when you suddenly became the alpha, anyway.</i></i></p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>It was only a little comforting to know that Deej and everyone else looked utterly bewildered as to why the three of them were practically in tears. Stiles caught his breath first, wiping at his eyes and chuckling as he scratched Jobo behind the ear. \u201cAll right, big girl. You can let me down, now.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Making a small noise, Jobo lifted him off of her shoulders, waiting until he had his cane out before she set him properly on the ground. The unicorn that Derek still had no explanation for let out a snorfle and nosed up against Nick\u2019s elbow. Derek was only slightly distracted by it, but only because he couldn\u2019t tell if it was actually shimmering, or if that was just from the sunlight reflecting off all the blood in it\u2019s coat.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Stiles made his way over to Derek, cane clicking against the floor as he smiled. \u201cTold you we\u2019d fix this,\u201d he said, reaching out and gently cupping Derek\u2019s shoulder.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cWhere did you get the unicorn?\u201d Derek blurted--instead of saying something more important, like \u2018I love you\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you\u2019, or even \u2018thank you for saving me\u2019.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Stiles had the audacity to look sheepish, shrugging and gesturing vaguely. \u201cWe needed something to summon that could carry Nick, and, you know, I was all for Cthulu or whatever, but like...unicorns, man. How was I supposed to pass that up? Besides, Basil\u2019s a total sweetie.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>There was probably something Derek should do, like cross his arms and look menacing, or maybe to lecture them on how reckless they had all been. He didn\u2019t do either of those things, though. All he could really do was reach out and grab Stiles, pulling him in until Stiles was crushed to his chest with a soft grunt.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Stiles dropped the cane with a loud clatter, clutching to Derek and sagging in a way that spoke volumes about how scared and freaked out he must have felt about the entire situation.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cThank you,\u201d Derek muttered, because he\u2019d had a few long years to learn when to show gratitude where it was due.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>With a tiny wiggle and snuffle into Derek\u2019s throat, Stiles sighed, \u201cyou\u2019re mine. I wasn\u2019t gonna give you up that easily.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Pulling away, Derek finally did what he\u2019d been wanting to do for hours, cradling Stiles\u2019 face in his palms and kissing him. Stiles\u2019 mouth curled into a smile against his lips, words muffled as he cooed, \u201caww yeah, kisses. The hero always gets the kisses. Best.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek growled into his mouth, nipping at the corner of Stiles\u2019 top lip and kissing him again, trying to at least squish the grin right off of Stiles\u2019 face. He didn\u2019t really care, anyway, as long as he got to keep holding Stiles like this.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Nearby, Deej and Nick were talking in soft undertones. Isaac had Jobo on body-cleanup duty while Allison and Scott got their post-adrenaline cuddling on and Boyd and Erica bickered on who had the best kill. Basil the unicorn was in the pantry, munching on apples and Ivanna had appeared out of nowhere and was fawning over the fact that there was a unicorn in her kitchen--though she soon wandered over to Isaac to help him with moving the remains of her old pack. The betas who were still around seemed to be at a loss for what to do, and were mostly hovering uneasily near Deej.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cIs it any different?\u201d Nick asked Deej.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Shrugging, Deej ran his tongue over his fangs, as if seeing if they had changed at all. \u201cIt\u2019s...intense... I don\u2019t know. I just feel really in control right now. This is weird.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>It would probably be best if they kept contact for a while longer, if only so that Derek could help Deej with the transition into being a new alpha. He said as much to Stiles, mouth nuzzling agains tthe hollow of his cheek. Stiles nodded, squeezing Derek tight. \u201cMight be a good idea. We don\u2019t need him going on a turning spree like you did when you became alpha.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Derek gave in to the childish desire to pinch Stiles in the side, taking pleasure in the way he squirmed.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cI kind of miss the blue eyes,\u201d Nick said. Deej let out a tiny dismayed sound, one that had Nick quickly shaking his head and adding, \u201cbut the red is kind of sexy. unhinged. I like it, it\u2019s different, but a good kind of different.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>They kissed, slow and happily, to a point where Derek had to look away. He almost wanted to ask Stiles what he thought of the red alpha eyes, but decided not to when Stiles sighed and thunked his head into Derek\u2019s shoulder.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cYou know what I miss?\u201d Stiles muttered, sliding his palms around until they rested on Derek\u2019s lower back.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cHm?\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cButt squeezies.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Stiles\u2019 hands slipped down to cup Derek\u2019s ass, massaging for a second before squeezing with a contented sigh. That was when Derek realized that Nick might be cute and nice, and everything Deej could ever want...but Stiles was everything Derek had ever needed.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>A tiny, contented rumble came from deep in Derek\u2019s chest, fingers sliding down until he could give Stiles\u2019 bottom a return squeeze that had Stiles snorting in amusement. Stiles lifted his head and ducked in to give Derek a quick peck on the lips before he pulled away reluctantly. \u201cAs much as I love post-bloodshed snuggles, we really have to figure out what\u2019s going to happen now.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>It was true, sadly. They needed to help Deej adjust to his new power as an alpha, and straighten out what would happen to the last of the Turner pack. Not only that, but Derek had a feeling that going home would be met with a few key discussions like his relationship with Stiles and the ethics of summoning mythological creatures for the sake of bloodshed and looking cool.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>No matter what, though, Derek figured that as long as he had the pack and Stiles at his side, nothing they faced in the days to come would be much of a trial at all.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>--</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i><b>Epilogue:</b> <i>one year later</i></i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>After months arguing, sexiles, Stiles disappearing for two days in a fit of pique, and even more trial and error, the pack came to the conclusion that Stiles\u2019 loss of memory couldn\u2019t be fixed by magic because it hadn\u2019t been <i>caused</i> by magic. The permanent brain damage was exactly that. Permanent. It was a miracle that Nick and Deaton were able to join ideas with Stiles enough to come up with a spell that gave Stiles the ability to borrow memories from the pack if the situation called for it. The downside was that it became such a hassle to cast that Stiles rarely did so unless the situation called for it.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Stiles still used the cane, but he\u2019d gotten better about his physical therapy after realizing that over-taxing himself meant he and Derek had to resort to vanilla sex, which Stiles apparently had a grudge against on a good day. The added strain was enough for Stiles to settle into actually letting Derek and the others help him with far less complaint in the past months.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Deej moved to Florida, and he took Nick and most of the pack with him. They planned on visiting after they were fully settled, mostly so that Nick could catch up with Stiles and tell them stories about all of the monsters (both human and supernatural) that he\u2019d encountered in the sunshine state.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Stiles moved into Derek\u2019s apartment in the fall, and it was like he\u2019d always been there. His stuff was constantly all over the place--to a point where he and Derek had gotten into a few arguments about who\u2019s turn it was to do the dishes, or that someone had forgotten to take their clothes out of the dryer again. The fights never escalated much beyond heavy bickering, and when it did, they usually ended with someone getting fucked on the kitchen table.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>When Derek\u2019s birthday rolled around, Stiles presented him with a pair of edible underwear and a parakeet. The underwear Derek understood--because it had been an inside joke the week before. The bird, not so much. At least, not until Stiles had sheepishly admitted that Deej had told him about what Derek had said to Jen about wanting children. Derek had been shocked, and a little disheartened at the implication, until Stiles had explained that he wasn\u2019t ready for kids, and that he hoped a bird would be acceptable until he was. Of course, after a beat, Stiles had added that Derek always reminded him of a bird when he puffed out his chest in pride or anger. Derek had almost pouted about that, but was mollified by the tease when he realized that Stiles had gotten him a bird because he wasn\u2019t ready for a family <i>yet</i>.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Which is exactly why Derek\u2019s morning routine had somehow become something like, \u2018wake up, shower, make breakfast and feed bird. Feed boyfriend.\u2019</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Only today, Derek planned on changing his routine just a little. He didn\u2019t want to feed his boyfriend, he wanted to feed his <i>fiance</i>.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>His father\u2019s ring sat heavy in his pocket while Derek went about scrambling a couple eggs as Stiles snoozed on obliviously. His parent\u2019s wedding rings were one of the only things Derek still had from the fire, and while Stiles couldn\u2019t wear his mother\u2019s, his father\u2019s seemed just about right. It might sit a little loose, but Derek figured they could always get it sized to fit him later on. Derek was sure it\u2019d do just fine for now, though.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>When the eggs were done and the toast buttered, Derek poured Stiles\u2019 coffee--making it just how he liked it--and took the entire tray into the bedroom. Stiles was starfished out on the mattress with the covers half hanging off of his legs and his mouth open in a soft snore. Derek hovered in the doorway just to admire the view before he sat down in the little space between Stiles\u2019 hip and the edge of the mattress. He put the tray down on the night stand, reaching over to card his fingers through Stiles\u2019 hair. Stiles snuffled, cracking one eye open and then letting it slide shut again with a tired mumble.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Huffing on a laugh, Derek took Stiles\u2019 left hand gently between his own, grabbing the ring out of his pocket and slipping it onto Stiles\u2019 finger. It did fit a tiny bit too loose, but it looked so <i>right</i> on Stiles\u2019 hand that Derek couldn\u2019t help but run his finger over it fondly. Stiles\u2019s eyes fluttered beneath his lids, already drifting back off to sleep as Derek bent down and gave him a kiss.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Blearily, Stiles muttered into Derek\u2019s lips, \u201cm\u2019hungry,\u201d and leaned up into the kiss with a happy sigh. Derek grinned, pulling away and grabbing the food tray while Stiles sat up with a yawn. He waited, watching as Stiles muzzily nibbled on his eggs and sipped at his coffee. It wasn\u2019t until the cup was halfway gone that Stiles stilled at the clink of the ring tapping against the mug. He blinked, and then stared at the ring on his hand like he was trying to process what it was.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you proposed and I forgot,\u201d Stiles croaked tiredly. Derek\u2019s gut twisted, guilt slamming into him like a sack of bricks. He was such an idiot.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cI didn\u2019t. I just. You know, I wanted to be-- I just put it on you earlier. I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking, I just--\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>Stiles shook his head, setting the coffee down on the tray and then putting the tray back on the night stand. Derek wanted to bite his tongue off, or maybe just go back in time and redo the entire morning.</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>\u201cGet over here, you dweeb,\u201d Stiles commanded, reaching out and grabbing a fistful of Derek\u2019s shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s been like a year since I got to call you my boo. Now I can do it whenever I want.\u201d</i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<i>The grin on Stiles\u2019 face was infectious, spreading to Derek\u2019s as he let himself be reeled in and kissed stupid. What they had may not have been the typical Disney romance, but it was plenty good enough.</i>\n</i>\n</p>"
