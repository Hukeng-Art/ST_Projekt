  "text": "<p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Stiles breathes, trying to keep his voice down. He jerks his chin toward the tall guy at the other end of the hallway, who\u2019s staring down at a sheet of paper with a furrowed brow. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>He could be a teacher, honestly, with that level of facial hair\u2014more than Stiles will likely be able to grow in his lifetime, ever\u2014but considering the backpack and the stack of textbooks under his arm, he\u2019s probably a student.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the new kid,\u201d Kira whispers back. \u201cDarren. Derek. Daryl. Something like that, my dad mentioned it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he a senior, too?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cHe must be, he looks like 22.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Immediately intrigued, Stiles hums. The guy is hot as hell, sure\u2014leather jacket <em>and</em> glasses, Jesus, be still his poor, bisexual, beating heart\u2014but more importantly, it must really suck being new on the first day of senior year.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re adopting him,\u201d he decides, tugging Scott and Kira by the elbow in that direction. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles strides across the hall, narrowly dodging a terrified-looking pack of freshman girls, and walks right up to the guy, who looks up and seems surprised that someone\u2019s actually talking to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d He tries to pitch his voice as cheerful but not <em>too</em> manic. Probably a lost cause. Whatever. \u201cYou\u2019re the new kid, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d He still looks a little wide-eyed behind those glasses, and it\u2019s not a bad look. \u201cYeah, I am. I\u2019m Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you, <em>Derek</em>,\u201d Stiles says, enjoying the way the name sounds coming out of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m Stiles. This is Kira, and this is Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Derek says. He shoots them all a tight, slightly cautious smile that shows off fucking <em>bunny teeth</em>, and yeah, Stiles is done for. He shakes his head a little and tries to recalibrate. Helpful new friends, right.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is your schedule, I presume?\u201d he asks as he tugs the piece of paper out of Derek\u2019s hands. He doesn\u2019t wait for Derek\u2019s response before he starts to scan the page. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s see...ooh, look at all those AP courses. So you\u2019re smart,\u201d he says appreciatively, and Derek chuckles a little, looking down as his cheeks flush.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Awesome</em>. I could use some more competition for valedictorian. I mean, there\u2019s Lydia, of course, and a couple of the new exchange students, apparently, though I\u2019m not sure they should really count. But yeah, anyway, we need fresh blood.\u201d Derek blinks at him, clearly surprised by his tangential rambling, but Stiles just barrels on. He\u2019ll get used to it. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re in AP physics and calc with me, Spanish with Scott, and history with Kira. Plus, we all have the same lunch period. That\u2019s pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p>The warning bell rings right above their heads, signaling two minutes until first period, and Derek winces. \u201cUh, physics now, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles confirms, rocking back on his heels and jerking his chin to the left. \u201cOther wing, so let\u2019s book it. You need to go to your locker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head, and Stiles just barely manages to resist grabbing him by the elbow. He should probably let the guy get used to his presence before he starts with the constant personal space invasion.</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Derek!\u201d Kira calls out cheerfully from behind them, and Derek waves over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s aggressively nice,\u201d Stiles says, and Derek laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s almost scary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know. What about Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEqually nice, but in more of a puppy-dog, nonthreatening way. They\u2019re together, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Derek repeats dryly, and Stiles gives him a look. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a part of their relationship, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d he says, and Derek snorts.</p>\n<p>They reach their physics classroom, which is full of students milling among the long lab tables. Stiles bites his lip. It\u2019ll be a bit of a risk, but he\u2019s going for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna be lab partners?\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>Derek eyes him, a little smirk twisted on his lips. He\u2019s got very expressive eyebrows, and Stiles is quite pleased to see that he\u2019s apparently got a bit of snark to him. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re smart? What if you\u2019re just trying to take advantage of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles somehow manages to swallow down his response to <em>that</em> and instead smirks back, bumping their elbows together. \u201cWell, now, you\u2019ll just have to trust me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek mutters something under his breath that Stiles doesn\u2019t catch. He hasn\u2019t actually answered the lab partner question, Stiles realizes, but just then Derek grabs him by the shoulder and pushes him down into a chair at a lab table smack-dab in the middle of the room. Stiles resists the urge to smile as he pulls a notebook from his backpack.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know anything about the teacher?\u201d Derek asks, leaning close, and Stiles shakes his head. He tries to remember what words are. Derek smells <em>really</em> good, fuck. Is it his deodorant? His shampoo? More investigation is clearly required.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no, not really,\u201d he says lowly. \u201cI think she\u2019s supposed to be good, if somewhat of a hardass. But literally <em>anyone</em> on planet Earth would be better than Harris in chemistry last year, so...\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grimaces as he sits back in his chair, and Stiles can finally breathe. \u201cGlad I missed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The first day of school is as boring as usual\u2014here\u2019s the syllabus, keep up with the reading, watch out for pop quizzes, etc., etc.\u2014and Stiles meets back up with Derek at lunchtime to lead him to their usual table.</p>\n<p>Stiles emits a sound of envy when Derek pulls a brown paper bag from his backpack. \u201cOh, man, a packed lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns a little as he takes out what seems to be a peanut butter-banana sandwich. \u201cWhat, is that weird? Do people not do that here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, you\u2019re totally fine, I\u2019m just jealous. It\u2019s better than whatever the hell this is,\u201d he says, poking dubiously at what he\u2019s assuming are chicken nuggets. Seriously, how can the cafeteria mess up chicken nuggets? \u201cI like to bring mine, when I actually remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how was your morning, Derek?\u201d Kira asks cheerfully, and Derek gives her another one of his tight smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Even though I\u2019m not sure about my physics lab partner,\u201d he says, his tone impressively dry as he tilts his head just a touch toward Stiles.</p>\n<p>Scott and Kira laugh, and Stiles feigns a gasp. \u201cOh, you asshole. I\u2019m gonna stick you with all the shitty sections of the lab reports.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try,\u201d he says, and Stiles rolls his eyes, trying to hide how enamored he is with this guy already.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, time for your first lesson in BHHS sociology. Those are popular kids, obviously,\u201d Stiles says, jerking his chin toward the table in the middle of the cafeteria. \u201cThe redhead is Lydia. My aforementioned competition for valedictorian. Also, student body president, prom queen, etc. She and I are actually friends, somehow, but mostly only for school stuff. The unfairly handsome guy next to her is her boyfriend, Jackson. He\u2019s a <em>douche</em>, but he\u2019s our lacrosse captain, so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys play lacrosse?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll three of us!\u201d Kira says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the men\u2019s team,\u201d Scott adds, clearly proud, and Derek looks impressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKira\u2019s better than me,\u201d Stiles admits freely, and the smile Derek shoots him definitely looks fond. \u201cWhat about you? You <em>definitely</em> look like you play sports.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks down at his food. \u201cNah. I run and lift weights and stuff\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Stiles cuts in, before he can stop himself. Shit, that might have been too much. Derek doesn\u2019t really react, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut other sports aren\u2019t really my thing,\u201d he finishes.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let Finstock see you.\u201d Stiles gestures at Derek with his fork. \u201cHe\u2019ll get one look at those biceps, and suddenly you\u2019ll find a lacrosse stick in your hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeez, Stiles has <em>got</em> to get his mouth under control. Thankfully Isaac drops down across the table from them, next to Scott. \u201cWhose biceps are you talking about this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yours,\u201d Stiles shoots back, glaring at him. He\u2019s still adjusting to Isaac and Scott\u2019s sudden best-bro-ship, it\u2019s fine. \u201cDerek, this is Isaac and Boyd and Erica,\u201d he says, nodding to them as they all sit down in a line, like usual. \u201cThis is Derek, he\u2019s new.\u201d</p>\n<p>The three of them wave, grunt, and smirk, respectively. \u201cAre you talking about the game on Friday?\u201d Isaac asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d Derek asks, turning to Stiles just as he\u2019s forcing down a mouthful of something dry that\u2019s apparently masquerading as a cookie. He coughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur first lacrosse game is Friday night.\u201d He holds his hand over his mouth to avoid spraying Derek with crumbs. \u201cAgainst our biggest rival. It\u2019s kind of a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should come, Derek,\u201d Erica says suddenly. She leans forward, resting her chin in her palm and giving him one of her slow grins. \u201cYou can sit with me while we watch these guys play.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, okay,\u201d Derek says. He shifts a little in his chair but doesn\u2019t really respond to her beyond that, and Stiles feels weirdly protective. Erica\u2019s attention can be a little overwhelming to someone who doesn\u2019t know her.</p>\n<p>She winks at Stiles, and he frowns. He never really knows if she\u2019s with Boyd and/or Isaac\u2014or neither and therefore possibly interested in Derek, because who wouldn\u2019t be? But she nudges his foot under the table. <em>For you</em>, she mouths, and Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>The conversation has drifted off to something that happened in Derek and Scott\u2019s Spanish class, which they share with Isaac, and Stiles tunes out, not listening to what they\u2019re saying in favor of staring at Derek, hopefully surreptitiously.</p>\n<p>He seems to always look a little bit guarded, a little on edge, and Stiles just wants to, like\u2026wrap him in a blanket and give him a hug. Or something.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>Back when Stiles figured out that he was probably-slash-definitely bisexual at the tender age of 16, he adopted Danny as his gay Yoda\u2014Danny <em>hated</em> that nickname, it was pretty hilarious. He was helpful, though. They snuck into Jungle together, though Stiles didn\u2019t really like the scene as much as Danny did. Somewhat-anonymous sex held zero appeal to him, it turned out. He lost his hand job virginity to Danny and had fooled around a little with a couple other guys, but that was it.</p>\n<p>But one of the things Danny told him\u2014along with lessons in how to correctly apply a condom and a lecture on the importance of lube\u2014was the despair of crushing on a straight guy. <em>I mean, you\u2019ll do it</em>, Danny said at the time, clapping him on the shoulder with an earnest look in his eye. <em>But it sucks, man.</em></p>\n<p>And now it looks like Stiles has his own test case. He knows better than to assume that everyone is straight, obviously, but statistically most people <em>are</em> straight. He hasn\u2019t gotten any sort of vibe from Derek, either\u2014not that Stiles is good at that sort of thing, though, at least according to Danny.</p>\n<p>Something nudges his elbow. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says loudly, snapping to attention and blinking rapidly. Derek\u2019s frowning at him, looking a little concerned with his cute eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Wow, if Stiles is thinking cute thoughts about Derek\u2019s <em>eyebrows</em>, he really is screwed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bell just rang,\u201d Derek explains, and Stiles looks around. Sure enough, the cafeteria is a mass of humanity, with everyone bottlenecking at the three trashcans like usual\u2014seriously, why can\u2019t the school spring for more trashcans?</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d He refocuses again and draws his attention back to Derek. \u201cGive me your phone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s frown gets deeper, but he obediently shoves his hand in his pocket and drops his phone in Stiles\u2019 hand. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles taps away, entering his number and quickly taking a ridiculous selfie of himself to save as the contact photo. \u201cSo you have my number now,\u201d he explains. \u201cText me so I have yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hands it back with a blinding smile, and Derek smiles back, if a little more hesitantly. But it\u2019s fine\u2014friendship by force usually works for him. It\u2019s how he got Scott.</p>\n<p>Derek steps over the threshold and takes a greedy deep breath, inhaling the familiar, comforting smell of <em>home</em> and <em>pack</em>. It always takes a little while for him to get used to the overwhelming crush of scents at school, and the first day is the worst.</p>\n<p>Cora pushes past him with a huff and drops her backpack in the foyer before flouncing into the den, and he drifts after her. His mom is at the desk, typing at her laptop, but she smiles warmly at them and lowers the screen when they walk in.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, guys. How was the first day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora shrugs and yanks her phone out of her pocket as she falls down onto the couch. \u201cFine, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom throws Derek a commiserating, exasperated look, and he gives her a little smile. Cora wasn\u2019t talkative with him either on the drive home. \u201cJust fine? How\u2019s the new school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d she says again, messing around on Snapchat or Instagram or whatever new app the young kids are onto now. Derek <em>already</em> feels old, how is that even possible? \u201cMy history teacher seems cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear. What about you, Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClasses are good. Made a friend,\u201d he says, even though it makes him sound eight instead of 18.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d his mom asks. Her eyes light up in surprise, and Derek can\u2019t blame her, really. He\u2019s not exactly known as a people person.</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cHe\u2019s in a couple of my classes. Showed me around, introduced me to some people, stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles who?\u201d she asks, pretending to be casual, and Derek sighs. He deserves the suspicion, sure, but he\u2019s looking forward to having his parents\u2019 unconditional trust again. Someday.</p>\n<p>\u201cStilinski, I think,\u201d he says, and she hums.</p>\n<p>\u201cStilinski\u2026that\u2019s the Sheriff\u2019s name, if I\u2019m remembering right. Can\u2019t be that many Stilinskis in town.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cDunno.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their conversation is apparently scintillating enough for Cora to peel herself away from her phone. \u201cIs he tall? Brown hair, moles?\u201d she asks suddenly, her eyes glinting, and Derek hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI overheard him talking about you outside my English room,\u201d Cora says, and their mom frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cCora,\u201d she admonishes, \u201cwe\u2019ve talked about that, that\u2019s rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora rolls her eyes\u2014the perfect picture of a petulant 15-year-old\u2014but Derek freezes. His biggest fear is that Stiles was nice to him just because Derek\u2026<em>has grown into his looks</em>, as his mother likes to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014what\u2019d he say?\u201d he asks, trying not to sound like he cares. And probably failing.</p>\n<p><em>Definitely</em> failing, if Cora\u2019s smirk is anything to go by. She doesn\u2019t mention it, though, because sometimes she isn\u2019t the worst. \u201cHe just said that he bets it\u2019s hard being new for senior year. Told some girl to be nice to you, I don\u2019t know who. He said you were cool, for some reason, so <em>he\u2019s</em> obviously not cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes and Derek huffs. \u201cHe\u2019s cool,\u201d he says lamely, defending Stiles. \u201cHe plays lacrosse.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Whatever</em>, Cora mouths, and he frowns at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he sounds very nice. You should have him over sometime, Derek,\u201d his mom says, with that tone that suggests it\u2019s more of a <em>demand</em> than a suggestion. He nods dutifully. \u201cTime for chores. Who\u2019s helping me in the garden, who\u2019s helping dad in the kitchen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKitchen,\u201d Derek answers quickly, before Cora can get a word in edgewise. He can hear a lot of people outside in the yard\u2014Peter and his kids, at the very least\u2014and after a full day of having to be at least marginally social, he\u2019d rather hide out with his dad in the kitchen and avoid people for as long as possible. Cora starts to complain, but Derek doesn\u2019t stick around for that and heads to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d his dad says, without turning around as Derek steps through the arched doorway to the kitchen, and Derek snorts. His dad is human, but they all swear that after so many years together, he\u2019s absorbed some of his wife\u2019s enhanced senses.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou survive the first day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, wincing. \u201cToo many people trying too hard on the first day and wearing too much perfume and cologne.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad laughs. \u201cYeah, well, they\u2019ll probably stop making an effort by the end of the week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod willing,\u201d Derek mutters, as he washes his hands. \u201cHow many are we cooking for tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody,\u201d his dad answers, and Derek grimaces. <em>Everybody</em> means the whole pack, and that\u2019s a lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad shrugs. \u201cJust everyone\u2019s first day of school, I think. Your mom\u2019s idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says with a laugh. His mom\u2019s always up for any kind of family gathering. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinish chopping those potatoes,\u201d he says, pointing with his knife. \u201cAnd then make brownies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and gets to work. His dad is great for many reasons, one of which is that he never pushes Derek to talk. They\u2019re happy to work side-by-side in silence, and Derek works through the stack of potatoes easily. His dad is the main chef in the family, and he\u2019s been teaching Derek ever since he was tall enough to stand on a stool and see over the counter. He loves it now, likes sequestering himself in the kitchen and working with his hands to make something that the whole family will share.</p>\n<p>He dumps the potatoes onto the baking sheets, as instructed, and starts carefully flipping through their cookbook of family recipes to find the peanut butter brownies that are Cora\u2019s favorite.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just about done with the batter, stirring in the flour, when he hears the distinctive pitter-patter of light steps coming into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, squirt.\u201d He stoops to pick up Maggie when she crashes into his legs, and she clutches at his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop calling me squirt,\u201d she complains, squirming in his grip. \u201cI turned six last week, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I remember, I was there.\u201d The combined racket of two dozen five- and six-year-olds hyped up on sugar was a noise he wouldn\u2019t soon forget. \u201cWhat about Robbie, can I still call him squirt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maggie\u2019s eyes light up, as they always do when confronted with the opportunity to bug her brother. \u201cYeah! He\u2019s eight minutes younger than me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hides a smile. Yes, and she never lets any of them forget it. \u201cSo how was kindergarten?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Super</em> cool,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cMr. Lopez is really nice, and he let me lead the whole class out to recess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d he says, eyes comically wide. It\u2019s good that someone is nurturing Maggie\u2019s bossy side, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaking brownies. You wanna help?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods, wrapping her arm around his neck, and Derek shifts her to a more comfortable position on his hip as he hands her a measuring cup. \u201cChocolate chips, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He holds the big bag as she plunges the cup into it, and <em>most</em> of the chocolate chips actually make it into the bowl. He helps her stir the thick batter and then sets her back down so he can scrape it into the pan and put it in the oven.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long until we can eat them?\u201d Maggie asks, sitting down in front of the oven once it\u2019s safely closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot till after dinner,\u201d Derek says, and he laughs at the anguished noise she makes in response. He swoops her up again, making her squeal, and slings her over his shoulder. \u201cWhere\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOutside,\u201d she says, tugging on Derek\u2019s hair in an attempt to steer him in that direction. He winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt your service,\u201d he says under his breath. They run into Peter just inside the French doors, and Maggie makes a happy noise, leaning off Derek\u2019s shoulders until Peter grabs her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek and I made brownies!\u201d she crows, and Peter gives her an appropriately impressed look. With Maggie\u2019s attention now firmly fixed on her father, Derek takes the opportunity to duck away.</p>\n<p>He detours to grab his camera from the den before joining everyone in the backyard. There are various aunts and uncles and cousins out there, and he answers several rote questions about his first day of school. Once he feels satisfied with his level of interaction, he wanders further into the woods and picks up his camera, snapping random shots of the trees against the fading sky.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as soothing as it always is, and Derek slowly relaxes. He loves his family, of course, more than anything, but sometimes he feels a little bit out of place. Somehow he missed out on the loud, friendly gene and ended up quiet and somewhat gruff instead. He doesn\u2019t feel unloved or anything, far from it, but especially after the events of the past year, there\u2019s a little distance there that he doesn\u2019t know how to overcome.</p>\n<p>Stiles <em>loves</em> lacrosse. He loves being part of the team, working hard enough that it actually makes him tired at night, and of course, actually being good at something. He and Scott both started playing in middle school, and after years of hard work, making first line at the beginning of last year is one of his biggest accomplishments.</p>\n<p>\u201cStilinski!\u201d Finstock yells. \u201cGet your head in the game, don\u2019t make me bench you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles winces. Okay, he loves lacrosse as long as he isn\u2019t busy worrying about whether or not the guy he has a crush on is in the stands. God, he\u2019s such a cliche.</p>\n<p>Derek <em>said</em> he was going to come\u2014both when Erica asked him on Monday and then again when everyone was talking about it at lunch today\u2014but each time Stiles sneaks a look over his shoulder to scan the stands, he doesn\u2019t see him. And he <em>thought</em> he was being subtle about it, but clearly not, if Finstock noticed.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only a few seconds left in their timeout, so Stiles tunes out when Finstock starts discussing a play that he knows by heart. He checks again, just one more time, and\u2026<em>ah-ha</em>! He finally spots Derek, sitting near the front next to Lydia. Well, that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s definitely weird. Erica\u2019s on his other side, though, and Stiles has a few precious seconds to worry over what they\u2019re talking about before Finstock blows his whistle, making everyone jump.</p>\n<p><em>Stop thinking about Derek</em>, he scolds himself as he pulls his helmet back on and jogs out onto the field.</p>\n<p>Beacon Hills wins, and Stiles is fairly pleased with himself\u2014he played most of the game and scored two goals, got an assist on another.</p>\n<p>The field fills with students after the game, and Stiles worms through them all, accepting random congratulations and pats on the back along the way, until he spots Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, slightly breathless as he skids to a stop in front of him. \u201cYou came.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, with a little smile. \u201cNice job, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hopes his face is still flushed enough from the game to cover any possible blush. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>He staggers at the sudden heavy weight on his back, and he twists his head to see Danny, who plants a smacking kiss on his cheek. \u201cNice job, Stilinski.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stiffens a little bit, stuffing his hands in his pockets, and Stiles really hopes it isn\u2019t because of the blatant guy-on-guy action. That would be a little bit of a problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, Danny, you\u2019re heavy,\u201d he complains, wiggling in an attempt to dislodge him until he finally slides off. \u201cHey, everyone\u2019s going to Paulie\u2019s. You should invite Ethan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny snorts and jerks his chin toward the far side of the field, where the other team is sullenly packing up their bags. \u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be in the mood to celebrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you need to cheer him up!\u201d Stiles punches him lightly in the chest. \u201cIf you know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny rolls his eyes. \u201cEveryone <em>always</em> knows what you mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPart of my charm,\u201d Stiles says, with a shrug and a wide grin. \u201cHey, you know the new kid, right? Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, hey,\u201d Danny flashes the infamous dimples, and Derek looks impressed, as anyone should. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever been officially introduced, but we\u2019re in the same English class, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Derek says with a little nod. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek seems relaxed now, so if he\u2019s bothered by the whole gay thing, he does a good job at hiding it. Danny moves along, grinning at the next unsuspecting person, and Stiles runs a hand through his sweaty hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he\u2019s dating someone on the other team?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, laughing. \u201cOur biggest rival. When Jackson found out, he didn\u2019t talk to Danny for like a week, I swear. He takes lacrosse a little too seriously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, uh, dating someone on the other team, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins. \u201cNo. Good joke, though.\u201d Derek blinks at him for a second, clearly trying to parse that one out, then blushes when he realizes what he said. Stiles takes mercy on him and keeps talking. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to Paulie\u2019s, that little diner in town\u2014you should come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Derek says, with that adorable little cute smile of his, and Stiles internally fist pumps.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome. Everyone\u2019ll probably head out in 10, 15 minutes or so. Be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives Derek an awkward knock to the shoulder and sprints off to the locker room to shower as fast as possible, not wanting to keep Derek waiting a second longer than he has to. Part of him is definitely worried that he\u2019ll just disappear. He ignores everyone celebrating in the shower\u2014it is <em>so </em>homoerotic, sports are so weird\u2014and pats himself dry in a hurry, grimacing as he pulls clothes on over his still-damp body.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s panting a little by the time he finds Derek again, sitting at the edge of the bleachers and playing with his phone, and Derek frowns up at him. \u201cYou okay? Your face is really red.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he says airily, trying to surreptitiously fan himself. \u201cJust, you know, warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott jogs past him, and jostles Stiles\u2019 shoulder without stopping. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d he calls out over his shoulder, \u201cwe\u2019re taking your Jeep!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just stands there, baffled, as he watches Scott, Kira, and Isaac hop into the Jeep and speed off.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you guys share a car?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, we most certainly do not. He doesn\u2019t have a car, though, so I gave him a key for <em>emergencies</em>\u2014a decision I\u2019m quickly beginning to regret. I\u2019m gonna make that fucker pay for gas now, though,\u201d he says, and Derek laughs. He tips his head in the direction of the parking lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want a ride, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, blowing out a breath. \u201cYeah, that\u2019d be great, thanks. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott is an <em>asshole</em> who totally planned this\u2014Stiles probably shouldn\u2019t have waxed poetic about Derek\u2019s dumb pretty face over text a couple days ago\u2014and Stiles hasn\u2019t decided yet whether he\u2019s going to punch him or hug him.</p>\n<p>He decides on <em>hug</em> when he sees Derek\u2019s car.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Stiles breathes, running his hand lightly over the hood. \u201cYou have a Camaro? How did I not notice that before? This is a sick car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister and I share it, technically,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cBut since she\u2019s away at college\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice,\u201d he says as he drops into the passenger seat. \u201cWhere does she go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a junior at Berkeley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool. That\u2019s, uh, where I want to go, actually,\u201d Stiles says, stumbling a little over his words. Not many people know that.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Derek says, giving him a little sideways look. \u201cI\u2019m actually\u2014I\u2019m going to visit her in a few weeks. You could come if you want, if you want to see the campus or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 jaw drops. \u201cWow, dude, really? That would be awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and ducks his head, busying himself with turning the key in the ignition. The engine makes a glorious rumbling sound, and Stiles maybe moans a little bit.</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow at him, and Stiles flushes, trying to think of something else to talk about, besides the fact that he might be a little turned on by the combination of Derek and his car and Derek <em>in</em> his car. \u201cSo, uh, do you have other siblings?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods absently as he carefully backs out of the lot. \u201cYeah, Cora. She\u2019s a freshman. What about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. Only child. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are only children supposed to be like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndependent, high-achieving, self-motivated,\u201d he recites, grinning broadly when Derek rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d he says dryly. \u201cThen I\u2019m not sure I believe the whole birth order theory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? You seem like a typical middle child to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth, then closes it again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether I should be offended by that or not,\u201d he says finally, and Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, dude, I totally meant it as a good thing. You\u2019re like, chill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m like, chill</em>,\u201d Derek mocks, in a frankly terrible impression of Stiles\u2019 voice, and Stiles laughs again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a bit of an ass,\u201d he admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the only way to get <em>noticed</em>,\u201d Derek says, pulling an exaggerated sad face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll bet,\u201d Stiles says, mock-serious. \u201cHow was it, growing up in between two sisters?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re both evil,\u201d he says immediately. \u201cI got conned into playing a lot of dress up when I was a kid. There were a lot of tea parties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a pleased noise. \u201cAt least there\u2019s two siblings I could bribe for baby pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grimaces. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a cute kid,\u201d he says, and Stiles can\u2019t hold back his huff of surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t really believe you. Clearly, the only solution is for me to see the pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, and Stiles laughs at him for the rest of the drive to the diner.</p>\n<p>The lacrosse team has commandeered several booths in the back corner, and Stiles nods at Danny, who\u2019s sitting with Ethan, Lydia, and Jackson. Jackson attempts to trip him on his way by, and Stiles responds by kicking his shin. \u201cStilinski. You didn\u2019t <em>completely</em> suck tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore goals than <em>you</em>,\u201d he counters, and Jackson makes a face. \u201cOh by the way, do you know Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson frowns and gives Derek a little considering glance, probably pissed that he\u2019s no longer the most handsome guy at Beacon Hills High. \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Stiles interrupts, grabbing Derek by the elbow to steer him away. \u201cHe\u2019s too nice for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek chuckles as they head toward the next booth, which already has Scott, Kira, and Isaac squeezed into one side. \u201cHe\u2019s charming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of an ass, but he\u2019s harmless, really. It\u2019s mostly just habit now, the two of us bitching at each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles follows Derek into the empty side of the booth, and he shoots Scott a glare and a pointed nudge under the table for ditching him. Scott just gives him that floppy grin, though, and Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re welcome</em>, Scott mouths.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck off</em>, Stiles mouths back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, losers,\u201d Erica announces as she strides up to their table and sits next to Stiles. It\u2019s a tight fit when Boyd slides in after her, but Stiles doesn\u2019t exactly complain about being pressed up fully against Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles whispers to him, now squished up against the wall, but Derek shrugs and doesn\u2019t seem to mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>wel-come</em>,\u201d Erica sing-songs softly in his ear, but Stiles just glares at her, too, and doesn\u2019t dignify that with a response. Is his crush that obvious? Did everyone take a vote and decide to gang up on him?</p>\n<p>Not that he\u2019s complaining. Right now, at least. Derek\u2019s thigh feels <em>solid</em> where it\u2019s pressed up against Stiles\u2019, and basically his entire attention span has narrowed down to all the places that they\u2019re touching. They\u2019re about the same height, which means their shoulders line up perfectly, and Stiles has to forcibly keep himself from leaning into the heat of Derek\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what brings you to Beacon Hills, Derek?\u201d Scott asks after they order, and Stiles perks up. Somehow, that hasn\u2019t yet been a topic of conversation.</p>\n<p>Derek tugs his water glass closer and takes a long sip before shrugging carefully. \u201cI grew up in Beacon Hills, actually. We moved to the San Diego area before I started high school, for my dad\u2019s job. Then my parents decided they wanted to move back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight before senior year,\u201d Kira says with a wince. \u201cThat\u2019s rough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs again, his thigh shifting against Stiles\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. My sister is starting high school now, so it\u2019s a good time for her.\u201d</p>\n<p>The waiter stops by with their food then, interrupting Stiles before he can ask more prying questions.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Dude, this calc problem set is gonna be the death.

He always at least tries to obey the no-phones-at-the-dinner-table rule, and even when he fails, he\u2019s better than Cora.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d his mom asks, and Derek shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust texting with Stiles. Is it okay if I go over to his house after school tomorrow to work on calculus?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom frowns for a second, and Derek tries to keep his expression as neutral as possible. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d she says finally, her face softening. \u201cJust let me know if you\u2019re staying there for dinner, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to <em>casa de Stilinski</em>,\u201d Stiles announces, holding the door open with a flourish, and Derek snorts as he walks by him. It\u2019s smaller than his own house, for sure, but it\u2019s neat and homey, clearly lived-in with a relaxed feel. \u201cOr as I like to call it, the bachelor pad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cWhat about your\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts himself off awkwardly when Stiles winces. Well, shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He toys with the strap of his backpack as he carefully closes and locks the front door. \u201cMy, uh, my mom passed away, a while ago.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Double shit</em>. Derek feels like a total dick. \u201cThat really sucks,\u201d he offers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I brought it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Stiles says. He smiles, but it looks forced. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. C\u2019mon, we can spread out our stuff at the kitchen table.\u201d</p>\n<p>They work for a little while, making frustratingly incremental progress, until Stiles groans and shakes his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, pushing back from the table. \u201cI need brain fuel. Study snacks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been at it for 15 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, Mr. Smarty Pants,\u201d Stiles says, flicking an eraser at Derek that he neatly dodges. \u201cSee if I share my snacks with you now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek drops his pencil and stretches. \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hums and squats down in front of the kitchen sink, oddly. He leans forward to rustle through the cabinet, behind a stack of paper towels, and Derek tilts his head as the motion makes Stiles\u2019 shirt ride up, revealing a strip of skin and the black band of his boxers. \u201cUh, your standard plethora of unhealthy snacks that I have to hide from my dad,\u201d he says as he turns around, and Derek jerks, averting his eyes. \u201cSunchips, Pop-Tarts, Oreos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could go for a Pop-Tart,\u201d Derek admits, and Stiles nods solemnly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSolid choice, my man, solid choice,\u201d he says, then stills as he reaches back into the cabinet. \u201cUnless you\u2019re one of those heathens who only likes strawberry or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pulls a face. \u201cS\u2019mores is the only acceptable flavor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles exclaims as he shows him the box. \u201cSame, it\u2019s fate.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rips open a package and pops both pastries\u2014though that\u2019s a real stretch of the word, to be honest\u2014into the toaster. Derek spots paperwork on the counter next to him, emblazoned with the logo of Beacon County, and the dots connect in his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s the Sheriff, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. \u201cYeah. Did kids at school warn you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No,\u201d Derek says, confused. \u201cMy mom recognized your last name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d he asks, and Derek frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would that <em>bother me</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs and plucks the Pop-Tarts out of the toaster, sucking briefly at his fingertips after he drops them on a large plate. \u201cKids can be dicks about it. Think I\u2019m a narc or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cHigh school kids are dumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> a high school kid,\u201d Stiles says. He rejoins Derek at the table and sets the plate between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not dumb,\u201d he retorts. Not dumb <em>anymore</em>, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood comeback,\u201d Stiles says, with an overwrought wink, and Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cBut no, it\u2019s cool. My dad\u2019s the fuckin\u2019 best, I don\u2019t care if it makes me unpopular.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns as he takes a bite of his Pop-Tart. He doesn\u2019t yet have a full grasp of the Beacon Hills High social strata, but he knows that Stiles isn\u2019t <em>un</em>popular. He says as much, and Stiles shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess. But Scott and I were nobodies until we got good at lacrosse. And even now it\u2019s\u2014I mean, I like lacrosse and all, but it\u2019s not like my entire life revolves around who scored the most goals against Riverside and who scored the most <em>chicks</em> at Jackson\u2019s party, you know? It\u2019s like\u2026I just want to shake them all and yell <em>this doesn\u2019t matter</em>. And\u2026sorry.\u201d Stiles winces and mimes zipping his lips shut. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t need such a deep dive into my psyche, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts and gives Derek a very pointed once-over. \u201cLike you\u2019ve ever had to worry about being popular.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flushes all the way up to his hairline and ignores that part. \u201cI\u2014I agree with you, that all that shit doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tilts his head and gives him a considering look. He opens his mouth to say something, but they\u2019re interrupted by the front door. Derek didn\u2019t even hear the car pulling up, Jesus.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff walks in, in his full uniform, and drops a hand on Stiles\u2019 shoulder. He\u2019s looks stern but also kind, and he instantly reminds Derek of his mother.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, son,\u201d he says, then narrows his eyes just a bit as he looks at Derek. \u201cHello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDad, this is Derek Hale,\u201d Stiles says absently, his eyes still on the paper in front of him. \u201cThe new kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you, Sheriff,\u201d Derek says. He stands and holds out his hand, and Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god a <em>handshake</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad is going to love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flushes, and the Sheriff scowls at Stiles as they shake hands. \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with appreciating people with manners, huh?\u201d he says to his son, then turns back to Derek. \u201cNice to meet you, as well, Derek. I take it my son has forced his friendship on you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Da-aad</em>,\u201d Stiles whines, rubbing at the back of his neck as he drops his head. \u201cSeriously? Come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs. \u201cI was worried about being new for senior year, but Stiles seems to have it taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are <em>lucky</em> to be friends with me,\u201d he mutters. He looks down at his textbook again, and Derek taps his foot with his own under the table. Stiles shoots him a tiny smile, and Derek returns it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d his dad says fondly, ruffling Stiles\u2019 hair. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go nap for a little bit before dinner. I might have to go out again later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJake\u2019s on paternity leave, remember? I\u2019m gonna have some extra shifts over the next few weeks. Have fun, guys, good luck with the homework. And if you go upstairs, be sure to leave the door open,\u201d he says, and Stiles winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, Dad, seriously,\u201d he groans, but his dad just smirks at him and heads for the stairs. Stiles grumbles to himself and stares intently at their problem set. \u201cSorry \u2018bout that. Telling him I was bi was an awful idea. Now he doesn\u2019t trust me with anyone, ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has a tentative look in his eye, as if he\u2019s not sure how Derek will react, and he racks his brain for something reassuring to say that isn\u2019t <em>I might be bi, too</em>. \u201cMy sister didn\u2019t tell our parents that she was a lesbian until she was 17. She had <em>sleepovers</em>,\u201d he says, grimacing, \u201cwith her girlfriend all the time before then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles cracks up. \u201cOh, man, that is positively genius. I can\u2019t lie worth <em>shit</em>, though, so that probably wouldn\u2019t have worked for me. Plus, you know,\u201d he says, jerking his head toward the stairs, \u201cthe sheriff. Built-in lie detector.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me, Laura is a <em>very </em>good liar,\u201d Derek says with a snort. Talk about built-in lie detectors. He\u2019s actually a little terrified of her. \u201cAlarmingly good.\u201d</p>\n<p>They get back to calculus and after a couple hours, have managed to work through most of the problem set.</p>\n<p>Stiles shoves his textbook aside and drops his head, resting his cheek against the table. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can go on,\u201d he says plaintively, closing his eyes, and Derek laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t <em>that</em> bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, it was,\u201d Stiles counters. \u201cI need a break before we finish. TV?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>They move to the living room, and Derek goes to sit down on the couch when he notices a large woven basket, filled with what looks like yarn, on one of the cushions. With one eyebrow quirked, he turns to Stiles, who flushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not,\u201d Derek assures him.</p>\n<p>Stiles scratches at the back of his neck. \u201cI, uh, I knit? Sometimes? It\u2019s weird, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not weird,\u201d he says, shrugging. He\u2019s a fucking <em>werewolf</em>, it takes a lot for him to find something weird. \u201cHow\u2019d you get into it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom liked to knit,\u201d Stiles starts, and Derek winces. He opens his mouth to say that Stiles doesn\u2019t have to talk about it, but Stiles waves him off. \u201cI had to go to therapy after she died. Anxiety, ADD, the whole shebang, and the therapist recommended that I try knitting. It calms me down because it\u2019s repetitive, it gives me something to do with my hands when the ADD is bad, and it gives me a connection to my mom. Triple whammy, I guess. It really works, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Derek says, impressed. He pokes through the basket. The yarn is soft, even against his sensitive skin, and there\u2019s a lot of it. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool. What do you do with it all?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cGifts, mostly. Please expect a hat for Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d Derek says seriously. He comes across a tiny hat and snorts, holding it out to Stiles. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this one\u2019ll fit.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles. \u201cYeah, sometimes I make hats and blankets for the babies down in the NICU.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek inhales sharply and looks at the hat again. It fits neatly in the palm of his hand. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, right,\u201d Stiles says, carefully picking up the hat and spinning it on one finger. \u201cOkay, this is depressing. TV? What d\u2019you wanna watch?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flips channels until he lands on a random sitcom. He chuckles at a dumb joke along with the laugh track, idly chewing at his thumbnail, but Derek is too preoccupied with their position to pay much attention. The couch isn\u2019t small, but there\u2019s only about three inches of space between them. Who sat down last? Derek can\u2019t remember, shit.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a little\u2026<em>startled </em>about his feelings for Stiles. He was not expecting to have a crush on anyone anytime soon, but the other day he found himself staring at Stiles, thinking about how pleasant his laugh is and wondering if his lips would feel as nice as they look.</p>\n<p>And at the moment, he wants nothing more than to slide over those three inches and stick his nose in Stiles\u2019 neck\u2014he smells <em>really</em> good. Which is weird. And decidedly not friendly behavior, so Derek should probably get a handle on this whole thing before it spirals out of control. He could really use a friend right now, and he doesn\u2019t want to do anything to screw that up.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 stomach makes an audible rumble, and he winces when Derek laughs. \u201cWell, time for dinner, I guess. You wanna stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might regret that once you hear what we\u2019re having,\u201d he says, and Derek narrows his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurkey burgers, whole grain buns, broccoli, sweet potato fries,\u201d he recites, then lifts his eyebrows in challenge.</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cFine by me. Are you the chef in the house?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe take turns, with mostly easy stuff. Dad has high cholesterol, though, so I try to keep his diet under control. I\u2019d like to do more, but my abilities are pretty limited.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek clears his throat. \u201cI, uh, cook some. I could show you some stuff, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 eyes light up, and Derek swears he can feel it warming his chest. Shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, his smile soft. \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re so hot,\u201d Derek mumbles against his lips, pressing him up against the closed door in Stiles\u2019 bedroom. Stiles tries to say <em>likewise</em> in response, but it\u2019s difficult to get the words out when Derek is so thoroughly devouring his mouth, not to mention robbing him of the ability to even think.</p>\n<p>Stiles just groans instead and pushes harder against Derek, shifting his hips so that they\u2019re pressed fully together. Derek slides his hand, torturously slow, from Stiles\u2019 neck down to the waistband of his pants. He pauses there, and Stiles flails in his strong grip, biting Derek\u2019s lower lip in retaliation. Derek laughs and <em>finally</em> slips his hand down that blessed inch, squeezing, and\u2014</p>\n<p>Stiles jerks into full consciousness and muffles a whimper into his pillow, thrusting mindlessly against the mattress. Holy shit.</p>\n<p>He gasps, trying to orient himself to what\u2019s actually real. His brain is <em>pissed</em>\u2014that Derek\u2019s not here, pressing him into the wall, or at the very least that he didn\u2019t get farther in his dream\u2014but his body is hopelessly turned on. He\u2019s a healthy 18-year-old who therefore wakes up hard just about every day, but normally he can at least wait until he gets in the shower. Not today.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles hisses, worming his hand into his boxers. It should be too dry to really be comfortable, but one, he\u2019s leaking like a faucet, and two, he doesn\u2019t think this is going to take very long, anyway. His dick is almost painfully sensitive, and he shivers down to his toes when he swipes his thumb over the head.</p>\n<p>Everything is hazy and warm under the blankets, and it\u2019s easy to put himself back into the dream, so easy to imagine Derek yanking at his zipper, curving a broad hand around his dick, or maybe even dropping to his knees and\u2014</p>\n<p>Stiles groans as he comes, curling inward and managing to catch it all in his hand to avoid messing up the sheets. He shoves the comforter down with a harsh exhale, shivering when the cool air hits his overheated skin.</p>\n<p>His crush on Derek is officially overwhelming. He just <em>likes</em> the guy, so damn much, and after today, it\u2019s probably going to get so much worse. They\u2019re going to the lake, along with Scott, Kira, Lydia, and Jackson, which means that Stiles is going to see Derek shirtless.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019ll be fine</em>, he tells himself.</p>\n<p>Stiles is <em>not </em>fine.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s put a lot of brainpower over the past couple weeks into imagining what Derek looks like shirtless, but the reality is even better than his dreams, which isn\u2019t exactly supposed to happen, he doesn\u2019t think. Derek has <em>abs</em>, like a lot of them, and a very nice light layer of chest hair that Stiles just wants to rub his face against. That\u2019s probably weird.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s distracting enough that he barely even notices Lydia in her bikini\u2014his crush on her might have faded over the past few years, as they became actual friends, but he still has <em>eyes</em>\u2014and intimidating enough that he hesitates before taking off his own shirt.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s decently ripped, he thinks, thanks to lacrosse, and his shoulders are broad, but he\u2019s still a little gangly and definitely paler than Derek, with far less impressive chest hair. But Stiles finally just does it, taking a deep breath and stripping off his shirt, and at least Derek doesn\u2019t run screaming or anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice tan, Stilinski,\u201d Jackson calls out, already in the water up to his chest, and Derek sidles closer to him, doing something under the water that makes Jackson fall over with a sputter and a splash.</p>\n<p>Everyone\u2019s laughing, even Lydia under her wide-brimmed hat, and Stiles doesn\u2019t think before he\u2019s splashing through the water and plastering himself onto Derek\u2019s back. \u201cMy hero,\u201d he croons, and Derek laughs as he hooks his hands around the back of Stiles\u2019 knees.</p>\n<p>He moves to slide off, but Derek\u2019s hands spasm a little bit, as if\u2026as if he\u2019s maybe not too uncomfortable with their current position. So Stiles takes a chance and passes it off as shifting his weight, hopefully, and slumps more against Derek. He holds his breath, anxious, but Derek doesn\u2019t react at all as he continues talking with Scott. Stiles exhales carefully and tries to be still.</p>\n<p>\u201cHale!\u201d Jackson yells. \u201cRace, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tips Stiles off his back without a second thought. He sputters indignantly and resurfaces with a flailing splash, but Derek\u2019s already taken off after Jackson.</p>\n<p>\u201cJerk,\u201d Stiles mutters, wading out further. Scott and Kira are heading for the shallows, probably to make out or something, so Stiles swims to the floating dock a little farther out. Lydia watches him climb up gracelessly and gestures for him to sit next to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019s competing for your affections,\u201d she says, and Stiles grimaces.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, shut <em>up</em>,\u201d he hisses, hoping that the sun is a decent cover for his sudden flush. \u201cDon\u2019t jinx it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughs and scoots over to give him some space under the umbrella.</p>\n<p>Derek seems to enjoy needling Jackson, much to Stiles\u2019 delight, and after he\u2019s thoroughly proved that he\u2019s a faster swimmer, Derek hauls himself up and leans his weight on his forearms on the dock, his legs dangling. The movement makes the muscles in his shoulders bunch <em>very</em> nicely, and Stiles lets himself stare for just a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he warns, and Derek freezes. Stiles turns around and backs toward the edge of the dock, his heels almost bumping up against Derek\u2019s folded arms.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and flings himself up and back, back-flipping into the water and landing behind Derek with a vicious splash.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Derek admits, and Stiles grins, scrubbing his hair out of his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen practicing that move since I was 10.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, let me try,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles hangs back to enjoy the view of Derek\u2019s clingy swim trunks as he climbs up onto the dock.</p>\n<p>\u201cLydia!\u201d he calls out. \u201cTell us who has a prettier back flip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care about your courtship rituals,\u201d she says with a smirk, and Stiles rolls his eyes, ducking down under the water for a second to avoid making eye contact with Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek tries to argue that his back flips are better because he can make a bigger splash, but he loses steam after Stiles points out loftily that <em>size doesn\u2019t matter, Derek</em>. After about 10 flips, he\u2019s feeling a little dizzy and staggers over to Lydia again.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know you can show off, too,\u201d she says under her breath. \u201cYou guys are like chimps. Next thing I know, you\u2019ll just be presenting your asses to each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek trips, falling off the other side of the dock, and Stiles snorts as he crawls over to make sure he didn\u2019t hit his head or anything.</p>\n<p>Scott produces a Frisbee, and after a couple hours of a viciously competitive game, Stiles hauls himself back onto the dock with a wince. It\u2019s well past the time to reapply sunscreen, and since he can feel his skin tightening, he should probably sit under the umbrella for a little while.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s cozy, even against the rough boards of the deck, and Stiles almost dozes off, so relaxed that he shrieks\u2014he\u2019d like to pretend otherwise, but it was definitely a shriek\u2014when a wave of cold water lands on his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says, clutching at his chest as he rolls over on his side to face the water. \u201cYou are <em>quiet</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins up at him, looking weirdly proud, and Stiles\u2019 breath quite literally catches in his throat as the sun highlights all the different colors in his eyes. Goddamn, he\u2019s sappy.</p>\n<p>Derek jerks his head toward the shore, where everyone else has gathered. \u201cEveryone\u2019s hungry,\u201d he says. Stiles groans and rolls off the platform, slipping into the water.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, \u2018m tired,\u201d he mumbles, sliding both hands through his hair, and Derek drifts closer, turning around.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen hop on.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>What the fuck</em>, Stiles mouths, grateful that Derek can\u2019t see him grinning like a loon. But he obeys, hooking both arms over Derek\u2019s shoulders and loosely wrapping his legs around his waist. He dares to rest his head against Derek\u2019s hair, cool under his cheek, and just hangs on as he swims back to shore.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so <em>early</em>,\u201d Stiles whines, pressing his face against the window, and Derek rolls his eyes as he backs out of the Stilinskis\u2019 driveway. Stiles looks ridiculous, sprawled out in the passenger seat and hiding in his hoodie, and Derek is <em>screwed</em> because he thinks it\u2019s cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically the same time as we would get up for school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and today is a day <em>off</em>,\u201d Stiles retorts. \u201cWhich means I shouldn\u2019t even <em>think</em> about being awake right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take you back home,\u201d Derek says mildly, and Stiles winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cI\u2019m just tired. I didn\u2019t sleep that well last night, and then my dad drank all the coffee this morning. I\u2019m really glad you invited me, this is gonna be awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek isn\u2019t sure <em>why</em> he invited Stiles to go visit Laura with him, practically just after they met, but now that they\u2019re actually friends, he\u2019s glad that he did. Stiles is his closest friend at school, probably, and he\u2019s trying to focus on that instead of on his growing crush.</p>\n<p>But as he swings by Starbucks on the way to the highway and enjoys Stiles\u2019 noise of gratitude a little too much, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s doing a very good job.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best,\u201d Stiles says under his breath, and he perks up considerably once they\u2019ve been through the drive-through, coffee and muffins in hand.</p>\n<p>The caffeine was perhaps not the best idea for being trapped in a car with Stiles, who sings along with the radio\u2014<em>loudly</em>\u2014and flips stations every four seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh,\u201d he says delightedly as he stops on one station and starts to sing along. \u201c<em>In touch with the ground, I\u2019m on the hunt down I\u2019m after youuuuuu</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, god.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a dumb song,\u201d Derek grumbles as he reaches for the radio, but Stiles slaps his hand away before he can touch the dial.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cWhat the hell. Do you have something against Duran Duran?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a dumb song,\u201d he repeats, and Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being ridiculous. This is an awesome song. My mom loved Duran Duran,\u201d he says, humming the tune. \u201cC\u2019mon, you gotta know the song, everyone knows this song.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know the song,\u201d Derek says with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>And I\u2019m hun-gry like the wollllllf</em>,\u201d he sings, even louder than before, and despite Derek\u2019s attempts to contain it, his mouth twitches into the tiniest smile. Stiles spots it, though, and grins.</p>\n<p>They fight over the radio for the rest of the two-hour drive, and by the time they find a parking spot at Berkeley, Derek\u2019s stomach hurts from laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had fun,\u201d Stiles accuses, hooking an arm around Derek\u2019s neck as they walk to meet Laura. \u201cDon\u2019t even deny it, I saw your grumpy face smiling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he mutters, shaking his arm off. He can spot Laura wading through the crowd toward them, and she\u2019s going to give him <em>so much shit</em> about Stiles, he can tell.</p>\n<p>Laura jumps into his arms from about three feet away, confident that he\u2019s going to catch her, and he wraps his arms around her gratefully, taking in her familiar scent. It\u2019s only been about a month since he\u2019s seen her, and even though they talk just about every day, it\u2019s not the same as being with her.</p>\n<p>\u201cMissed you, bro.\u201d She plants a smacking kiss on his cheek before she lets herself down.</p>\n<p>\u201cMissed you, too. This is Stiles,\u201d Derek says, gesturing, and Stiles grins at Laura, his hands stuffed in his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. Thanks for letting me crash your brother-sister weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep us from killing each other,\u201d Laura says cheerfully, and Stiles\u2019 eyes go a little wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014you guys seem to get along pretty well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura smirks. \u201cYeah, well, the claws haven\u2019t come out yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>She winks at Derek, and he rolls his eyes as Stiles laughs. \u201cSo where are we going, oh wise one? My future is in your capable hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClasses first. Anthropology and sociology,\u201d she says, and Stiles\u2019 eyes light up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome. Those are your majors, right? That\u2019s what Derek said, anyway. How\u2019d you decide?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing Laura loves more than being an authority on something, and Derek trails behind them as they chatter away wildly about different majors and professors.</p>\n<p>Stiles is looking a little star-struck by the time they get to the lecture hall, and Derek is stupidly, irrationally jealous. He <em>cannot </em>cope with the guy he has a crush on also crushing on his sister. Just\u2026no.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to have a crush on my sister,\u201d he leans over to say under his breath, and Stiles flails.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, dude, no.\u201d Stiles makes a face. \u201cJust\u2026no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cSo she isn\u2019t good enough for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he wails, covering his face with his hands, and Derek smirks. \u201cYour sister is very attractive,\u201d he whispers, still hiding behind his hands, \u201cand is undoubtably a catch. But no crush, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>His heartbeat is steady\u2014no lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says, satisfied.</p>\n<p>Stiles has <em>way</em> too much fun in the two classes they sit in on, and Laura has to practically sit on his hands so that he doesn\u2019t contribute to the conversation.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Stiles professes a need for more caffeine, and he insists on getting drinks for all of them as a thank you. Derek stands with Laura off to the side and idly watches him worm his way through a line of people at the coffee cart.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for having both of us,\u201d Derek says to her. \u201cReally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m always happy to have you visit. Plus, I had to check out your little crush,\u201d she says, grinning widely, and Derek turns to gape at her. There\u2019s no point in denying it\u2014she\u2019s the good liar in the family, not him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d he says instead, sighing, and Laura snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>do</em> talk to Cora, you know. And Mom. They say you won\u2019t shut up about him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Derek whines, and she laughs, wrapping an arm around his waist just a little too tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t embarrass you\u2014much. He\u2019s cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs again and leans against her just a bit. \u201cI\u2019m kinda still trying to deal with it. It\u2019s surprising.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, why? Cause he\u2019s a guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cNot really. I just\u2026wasn\u2019t exactly expecting it. You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura\u2019s eyes soften. She opens her mouth to say something in response, but they\u2019re interrupted by Stiles, walking carefully as he balances three drinks in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn iced latte for the lovely lady, and a mocha for Derek. For his secret sweet tooth,\u201d he says with a wink, and Laura bursts out laughing.</p>\n<p>Derek frowns down at his drink. \u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles taps his temple, grinning. \u201cI pay attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to worry about your crush being unrequited,\u201d Laura says, too soft for Stiles to hear, and Derek flushes.</p>\n<p>Laura disappears in the afternoon to work on a group project, and Derek and Stiles wander the campus. They meet back up for a late dinner, and Laura offers to take them to a party.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a frat party?\u201d Stiles asks, and Laura wrinkles her nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, frat parties are lame. Are you interested in pledging a frat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cNah, not really. I think I\u2019m getting my fair share of lax bros in high school, that\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>are</em> a lax bro,\u201d Derek points out, and Stiles gasps, pretending to be offended.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em>not</em>, you take that back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are literally wearing a backward snapback right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pouts, his shoulders slumping as he sheepishly turns his hat around.</p>\n<p>The party\u2019s at a sprawling, somewhat-rundown house just off campus, with music and people spilling out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo <em>not </em>embarrass me,\u201d Laura says lowly, pointing at each of them in turn. \u201cAnd if anyone asks, I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo falling-down drunk, got it,\u201d Stiles says, with a mock-salute, and Laura snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, like I\u2019m gonna give the <em>Sheriff\u2019s kid</em> alcohol. No drinking allowed, I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ll know if you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks appropriately terrified. \u201cI don\u2019t know <em>how</em> she would know,\u201d he whispers, once Laura flounces away. \u201cBut I believe her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smirks. Laura could smell a drop of alcohol on Stiles from 10 yards away, and he almost wants Stiles to drink just to see what she\u2019d do. He\u2019s not <em>actually</em> that cruel, though, so he just shoves Stiles in the direction of the front door.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s overwhelming inside, loud and full of unpleasant scents. Derek can just about keep track of Stiles\u2019 familiar heartbeat, if he tries, and he tries to focus on that to keep himself steadied.</p>\n<p>The music is loudest in the living room, where there\u2019s a crush of people dancing, and Stiles stops right in the middle of them, suddenly enough that Derek runs right into his back. He starts wiggling his hips to the beat, and Derek winces.</p>\n<p>Oh, dear. He <em>definitely</em> can\u2019t do this without getting hard.</p>\n<p>He lets his hands linger on Stiles\u2019 hips for a few extra seconds as he forcibly separates them and keeps them moving toward the kitchen. He keeps a hand on Stiles\u2019 shoulder, under the guise of staying with him as they worm through the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust leaving me hanging like that? Harsh, dude,\u201d Stiles says, even though he isn\u2019t resisting.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe music sucks,\u201d he says, which isn\u2019t a lie.</p>\n<p>The drinks are in the kitchen, as he expected, and even though they aren\u2019t <em>drinking</em>, Derek would really appreciate having something to hold in his hands so he isn\u2019t tempted to do anything dumb like hold Stiles\u2019 hand. There\u2019s a row of soda bottles on the back counter, so Derek grabs two red cups and heads in that direction. Someone bumps against his side in what seems like a purposeful manner, and he looks over.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d It\u2019s a girl, blonde and very pretty with thick curly hair spilling over her shoulder. She smiles at him, her eyes bright, but Derek just gives her a tight smile in response and averts his gaze, focusing on pouring. She gets the message, he thinks, because the weight moves away after a second.</p>\n<p>Another body quickly replaces her, but Derek recognizes this one.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dude</em>,\u201d Stiles hisses, elbowing Derek right in the ribs. \u201cYou could totally hook up with a college girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek winces. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d really\u2026rather not.\u201d Do that again, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Stiles asks plainly, and Derek shrugs, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna ditch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019cool, I\u2019ll be your wingman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes and thrusts a cup of Coke into Stiles\u2019 chest, holding it there until Stiles\u2019 hand comes up to grab it, his fingers brushing against Derek\u2019s. \u201cI <em>just</em> said I didn\u2019t wanna hook up with anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head, wagging his finger at the same time. \u201cCommon misconception. Wingmen\u2014wait, that sounds weird. Wingmans?\u201d Derek lifts his eyebrows, telegraphing his utter lack of an opinion. Stiles rolls his eyes and keeps going. \u201cAnyway. <em>People who wingman</em> are just helpful in general. You don\u2019t wanna hook up with anyone, I\u2019ll keep people away from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts and searches in vain for a place to stand where they won\u2019t be pressed together by the crush of people. \u201cYou think that deserves its own job title?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t seem to mind the crowd and stops in a random hallway, leaning against the wall. \u201cHave you <em>seen you</em>?\u201d he asks, his face twisted up in a scoff. \u201cI should have brought caution tape or something. Or like, one of those <em>please don\u2019t touch the art</em> signs like in a museum.\u201d He gestures, nearly sloshing his drink onto the floor. \u201cYou know, hung around your neck on a chain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thank goodness it\u2019s dark in here because it hides Derek\u2019s blush. <em>You need your own sign</em>, is what he wants to say. \u201cStop being ridiculous,\u201d is what he says instead. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d he forces himself to say. \u201cI\u2019m sure you could find a girl. Or a guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head, gnawing on the rim of the cup. \u201cNah. Casual sex\u2019s not my thing, found that out already. I\u2014man, that makes me sound like a slut. Not that being a slut is a bad thing!\u201d he yelps. He winces and covers his eyes with his hand, slumping further against the wall. \u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs. \u201cRelax.\u201d</p>\n<p>The needy, curious part of him wants to press and ask questions about every aspect of Stiles\u2019 sexual history, but he manages to restrain himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stiles says, looking around pointedly with his eyebrows raised. \u201cThis is a college party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLots of loud, drunk people,\u201d Derek agrees. \u201cNot much different than a high school party.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d Derek asks, laughing, and Stiles shakes his head with a little grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ve so far managed to resist being swayed by pop culture telling me that college parties are the pinnacle of sexual expression and depravity. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go outside,\u201d he says, jerking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s really loud in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thank <em>god</em>. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>They end up stretched out on the grass in the backyard, and Derek wiggles his hips to slide his phone out of his pocket. The trees are different here, and he wants to capture it.</p>\n<p>As he frames the photo carefully, Stiles leans over, his chin almost resting on Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking a picture,\u201d he says dryly, and Stiles groans, the noise vibrating through Derek\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit. You like photography or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, surprised that he\u2019s never told Stiles. \u201cKind of a lot, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hums and doesn\u2019t move from where he\u2019s rolled closer. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. You must have a nicer camera, though, better than your phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He takes a couple more shots so he doesn\u2019t have to look at Stiles. \u201cBut the best camera is the one that\u2019s with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts and finally rolls back, out of Derek\u2019s space. \u201cDeep, Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura finds them a while later and stands over them, her hands on her hips. \u201cAre you guys <em>high</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head, but Stiles holds out his thumb and index finger, about an inch apart. \u201cJust a lil\u2019 bit, from those people smoking over there.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighs, but she looks fond as she steps back and jerks her head. \u201cC\u2019mon, this party is lame. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hops to his feet and stretches a hand down to Stiles, hauling him up easily. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Stiles says, crashing against Derek\u2019s chest and bracing a hand against his shoulder for balance. \u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d</p>\n<p>He winces\u2014way to keep the super-strength under wraps.</p>\n<p>They walk back to Laura\u2019s on-campus apartment, which she shares with three other girls. \u201cMy roommate is kindly spending the night with her boyfriend,\u201d she says quietly, presumably because the door to the second bedroom is already closed, \u201cso you guys can share her bed. The futon is shit, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d Stiles says with a shrug. He rifles through his duffel bag and disappears into the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Derek turns to Laura, who\u2019s grinning. \u201cSeriously?\u201d he says lowly. \u201cSharing a bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you expect? And do <em>not</em> have sex with him, Derek, I swear to god. I will never forgive you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sputters. \u201cI\u2019m classier than that,\u201d he says finally, and she rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sharing a twin bed with Stiles isn\u2019t the easiest\u2014neither of them are exactly <em>small</em>, and they keep bumping elbows and shoulders as they both flip around and try to get comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, dude,\u201d Stiles says lowly, laughter coloring his voice as they bump hips again. Derek sighs, trying to sound put-upon as he <em>accidentally </em>jabs Stiles in the ribs with his elbow. Stiles laughs again, apparently ticklish, and retaliates with a knee to Derek\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>Laura\u2019s sigh is loud from the other side of the room. \u201cCould you two please stop flirting? Just fucking <em>cuddle</em> or whatever, I don\u2019t care, just go to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face <em>burns</em> in the dark, and he breathes carefully, pointedly not looking over at Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d let you be the little spoon,\u201d Stiles whispers, still loud enough for Laura to hear, and Derek snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy shoulders are broader.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>, are you serious? No fucking way. My\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Laura yells. \u201cRight now. Go to sleep. Argue about your shoulders tomorrow, when I don\u2019t have to hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Stiles\u2019 are nicer</em>, Derek thinks idly.</p>\n<p>Said shoulders are still vibrating slightly with repressed laughter, and Derek focuses on Stiles\u2019 steady breathing as he drifts off.</p>\n<p>In the morning, Derek wakes with the startled alertness that always happens whenever he sleeps in a new place. He cranes his head, looks around\u2014Laura\u2019s bed is empty, but Stiles is still sacked out next to him, on his back with his thigh pressed against Derek\u2019s. Derek lays there for a second, enjoying the shared body heat, before he starts to feel too creepy and carefully climbs out of bed.</p>\n<p>Laura\u2019s sitting at their tiny kitchen table, flipping through a magazine and sipping a cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s <em>Stiles</em>?\u201d she says in a sing-song voice, and he glares at her half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsleep. Keep your voice down.\u201d</p>\n<p>He steals her coffee for a sip, and she pinches him, <em>hard</em>. \u201cYour crush is worse than I thought,\u201d she says frankly, making Derek wince.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse than I thought, too,\u201d he admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should tell him. About us,\u201d she says, and he snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot everyone takes it badly, Der.\u201d</p>\n<p>He scratches at his beard. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Mom won\u2019t let me tell anyone ever again,\u201d he says, and Laura smiles, a little sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to tell him <em>tomorrow</em>. Just think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says, just so she\u2019ll stop pestering him about it. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably happen by accident anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura smirks knowingly. \u201cYou think he smells good, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he moans, burying his head in his arms. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna die.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughs and runs a hand through his hair, tugging lightly. \u201cHe likes you, it is <em>so obvious</em>. So why don't you just ask him out?\u201d Derek's face must show the utter disregard he feels for that statement, and Laura rolls her eyes. \u201cWhat, you're just gonna swear off dating forever because of a couple bad eggs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA couple <em>bad eggs</em>?\u201d he repeats, incredulous, but Laura just waves her hand. \u201cAnd yes, that's exactly what I was planning to do, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I get such a good vibe from him. Don't you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't trust myself anymore,\u201d he admits, and Laura's face softens.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, trust <em>me</em>, then. He\u2019s a good guy, I think you should go for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He swallows. \u201cAnd what, just kiss him or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura rolls her eyes again, more dramatically this time. \u201cOh my <em>god</em>, you caveman. Actually ask him out on a date like a normal person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, a little dazed. \u201cI could maybe do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Friday brings another lacrosse game, and much to Stiles\u2019 delight, Derek shows up <em>again</em>. Stiles plays even harder than usual, scoring two goals while again resisting the urge to look for Derek in the stands, and tries to convince himself that he\u2019s not a cliche.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a party afterward this time, and Stiles follows Derek over to Lydia\u2019s house after he successfully convinces him to come. Lydia presses a solo cup of beer into his hand almost as soon as they walk in, and he offers it to Derek.</p>\n<p>He frowns and makes an aborted motion toward the cup. \u201cI, uh, don\u2019t really drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dude, that\u2019s totally cool,\u201d Stiles says, taking it back. \u201cI rarely have more than like, two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Sheriff?\u201d Derek says knowingly, and Stiles laughs, nodding.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. Plus, I would never drive drunk, and I usually have the Jeep, so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a <em>responsible</em> underage drinker,\u201d Derek says, in that delightfully dry way of his. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles slings a playful arm around Derek\u2019s neck and drags him further inside to make a round of the house, saying hi to a couple of people and ignoring just about everyone else. \u201cI\u2019m over high school parties,\u201d he declares, after about 10 minutes, and Derek snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe college party was pretty much the exact same as this,\u201d he points out. \u201cWith maybe more sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t go upstairs,\u201d Stiles jokes, and he laughs when Derek winces. In all honestly, the party is not that great. Stiles doesn\u2019t really care about any of these people, and there\u2019s a group of people playing spin-the-bottle\u2014seriously, what are they, 14? \u201cThis party is kinda lame,\u201d he says, and Derek looks grateful as he nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, this isn\u2019t really my thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hums as he tries to think of something else that they could do. He\u2019s not quite ready to be done with Derek\u2019s company, but there aren\u2019t a whole lot of options in Beacon Hills at this hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, have you been to The Pie Shack?\u201d he asks, and Derek shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s this 24-hour pie place in the next town over. Wanna go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not. I could go for pie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives him a mock salute and hooks a hand around the crook of his elbow, under the guise of not getting separated as they worm their way out of the party. Derek seems to relax, the tight line of his shoulders loosening, as soon as they step outside and the thrum of music fades away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a curfew?\u201d Stiles asks, and for some reason Derek looks a little embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, not really. My parents are really big on knowing what I\u2019m up to and who I\u2019m with, but other than that they\u2019re pretty cool. What about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s mostly a formality. Same thing, really\u2014if he knows where I am and who I\u2019m with, he\u2019s pretty flexible. Plus, he has spies like, all over town,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cSo I couldn\u2019t hide much from him, even if I wanted to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me drive,\u201d Derek says. He jerks his chin toward the Camaro on the other side of the street. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins\u2014he only had about half a cup of beer, he\u2019s completely fine\u2014but nods and follows Derek to the Camaro. He\u2019s not dumb enough to turn <em>that</em> opportunity down.</p>\n<p>The 20-minute drive is mostly quiet. Stiles feels oddly calm in Derek\u2019s presence, which isn\u2019t exactly something that he\u2019s ready to think about yet. He likes it, though, likes how he\u2019s equally comfortable whether he\u2019s chattering away, with Derek interjecting pointed, dry comments, or quiet, just staring out the window and tapping his fingers on his leg as Derek drives.</p>\n<p>The Pie Shack is moderately busy when they pull into the parking lot, just like it always seems to be no matter the day or time. Derek seems a little bit nervous and locks the Camaro about four times. Stiles pats him on the arm. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a little sketchy with the night crowd, but that\u2019s part of the fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grimaces when they walk in, and Stiles can\u2019t really blame him. The place is pretty dated and shabby-looking, not really more than a literal pie <em>shack</em>, but the pies are to die for. \u201cJust trust me,\u201d he says, and Derek gives him a little side-eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says simply, and it somehow feels bigger than just a word.</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows to cover his reaction and steps up to the counter. \u201cYou wanna split a slice? They\u2019re huge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek says absently, his gaze drifting over the pies in the display case. \u201cYou pick. The only thing I don\u2019t really like is key lime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe peanut butter chocolate silk pie is my favorite, that good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles slides cash across the counter while Derek\u2019s distracted by the framed write-up in the Beacon Hills Gazette from 1987, and he frowns when he notices it.\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d he complains, but Stiles just smirks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou drove here. <em>And</em> let me pick the pie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Derek says, even though he still looks grumpy about it.</p>\n<p>They sit at the counter, on a pair of unbalanced, cracked vinyl bar stools, and a bored-looking waitress slides over a plate with a giant piece of pie and two forks.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheers,\u201d Stiles says, holding up a fork, and Derek snorts as he taps it with his own. They each take a bite, and Stiles thoroughly enjoys watching Derek\u2019s eyes widen in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d he says after he swallows, licking his lips, and Stiles cackles.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So</em> good, what the hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek playfully tugs the plate closer to himself, curling one arm around it in an attempt to keep it away. Stiles groans and tugs at his arm\u2014in vain, as it turns out, because goddamn he really is strong. Stiles ends up kind of just petting his bicep, and he pulls away when he realizes it, his cheeks flushing.</p>\n<p>Their forks battle over the last bite, but Stiles manages to shoulder Derek out of the way and steal it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have whipped cream on your face,\u201d he says, and Stiles grimaces. He uses his tongue and then opens his mouth to ask if he got it, but Derek just sighs and drops off the stool, heading toward the door. Stiles quickly swipes his fingers over his mouth and jogs after him.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s in kind of a weird mood on the drive back to Beacon Hills, even quieter than usual with his eyebrows drawn low, but Stiles just chatters away about their latest physics lab and movies that are about to come out and anything else that crosses his mind.</p>\n<p>Derek pulls to a stop behind Stiles\u2019 Jeep then clears his throat when Stiles moves to unbuckle his seat belt.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he says, hesitating as he catches Derek\u2019s gaze. Derek doesn\u2019t say anything, just looks at him, but then he breaks the spell and shakes his head, scratching at his beard.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. Never mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says awkwardly, unbuckling the seat belt and getting out of the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the pie!\u201d Derek says belatedly, and Stiles lifts his hand with a grin as he jogs backward toward the Jeep.</p>\n<p>Stiles freezes, his face twisting into a grimace as he looks between Derek and the countertop. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just chopping vegetables. Stop being dramatic, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t insult me when I\u2019m holding a giant knife,\u201d Stiles mutters, and Derek presses his lips together to hide a smile.</p>\n<p>Stiles hadn\u2019t let Derek forget about his promise to help him with some cooking tips, and they finally found an open afternoon, Thursday after school, to make an easy turkey chili.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you actually know how to use a knife properly?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, sorta,\u201d he says, but his gestures with the knife are expansive enough that Derek winces and takes it away from him. Derek doesn\u2019t have to worry about knife safety too much when he\u2019s cooking, thanks to the whole healing thing, but his mom still tends to complain when there\u2019s blood in the food.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold it like this,\u201d Derek says, demonstrating, \u201cand keep your fingers curled under. Just rock the knife.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is clumsy and a little slow, but he works his way through an onion and a bell pepper without too much trouble. \u201cI thought canned vegetables were bad,\u201d he says, frowning at the can of tomatoes, and Derek shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re fine, especially tomatoes. Just check the sodium.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ground turkey is browning away with the onion and garlic when Stiles\u2019 phone vibrates on the countertop. He wipes his hands on the towel slung over Derek\u2019s shoulder before he picks it up and snorts as he reads whatever message he got.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s funny, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek goes unnaturally still and only keeps stirring on autopilot. \u201cYou\u2019re texting with Laura?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he says absently, tapping away. \u201cShe answers all my incessant questions about Berkeley.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>. He should probably steal Stiles\u2019 phone and make sure Laura isn\u2019t saying anything that she shouldn\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you still like Berkeley?\u201d he asks instead, hoping to redirect the conversation. It works, and Stiles brightens.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles puts his phone down and carefully measuring the spices into the pot at Derek\u2019s instruction. \u201cYeah, definitely still my first choice. This is probably going to put an end to Scott and I\u2019s lifelong plan to be college roommates, but\u2026oh, well, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere does he want to go, do you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not really. He\u2019ll probably go wherever Isaac goes,\u201d Stiles says, sighing with a little sneer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Isaac?\u201d Derek asks, curious. The two of them have a couple classes together and are becoming friends, Derek thinks, but he knows that he and Stiles don\u2019t exactly get along.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 face twists again before he smooths it out. \u201cNothing, I swear. He\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, but it\u2019s a weak lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're gonna think I'm a terrible person,\u201d Stiles warns, and strangely, that relaxes Derek. People who are <em>actually</em> terrible aren't quite so forthcoming about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI sincerely doubt that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cSo\u2026Scott and I are bros for life, right? Like, we bonded hard-core in kindergarten and it\u2019s been like that ever since. He was there when\u2014\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice catches, and he swallows before he keeps talking. \u201cWhen my mom died, and it\u2019s always been just the two of us. But now, as of last year, he\u2019s all buddy-buddy with Isaac, they hang out together all the time. And I\u2019m just\u2026I\u2019m just jealous, especially because Isaac doesn\u2019t even like me that much. It\u2019s <em>dumb</em> as fuck, I know, but still. It doesn\u2019t help that they live together, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Huh. Derek didn\u2019t know that. \u201cWhy does he live with Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grimaces. \u201cIsaac\u2019s dad\u2019s a piece of shit drunk who used to beat him up, like a lot. Last year he moved in with the McCalls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you feel bad about being jealous,\u201d Derek surmises, and Stiles nods, frowning as he bites his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, awful, right?\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cGod. He\u2019s had a really tough life, and I can\u2019t even share my best friend with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you wish he still lived with his dad, right?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles' responding look is horrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>, of course not. I'm not a monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cThen you\u2019re fine. It\u2019s natural to be jealous about something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says with a snort. \u201cI think it\u2019s just me. I\u2019m too possessive, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, god. Derek <em>really</em> doesn\u2019t need to think too hard about Stiles being possessive.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Look, Laura and I are close, right?\u201d he says, and Stiles nods. \u201cWell, I was <em>such</em> a dick to her when she went off to college, as if she had the audacity to go off and make friends that weren\u2019t me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Stiles says, laughing a little as he playfully pats Derek\u2019s cheek. \u201cPoor baby Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d he says. His cheeks are flushed, he can feel it, but he ignores it. \u201cNot just you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes the wooden spoon from Derek\u2019s hand and stirs. \u201cWhat about Cora? Are you guys close?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hesitates. He can't exactly tell Stiles that Cora went through an intense and not entirely unwarranted phase of hating Derek's guts, one that they're still somewhat working through the ramifications of.</p>\n<p>\u201cKinda,\u201d he says finally. \u201cWe're more similar, so I think that makes it harder.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you mean she's a grumpy nerd just like you?\" Stiles asks. He's grinning, though, and Derek can't help but smile back.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he says anyway, shouldering Stiles out of the way to check on the chili. \u201cIt looks good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek turns the burner down to the lowest level and reaches around Stiles for the pot lid. \u201cNow you cover it and let it simmer for about half an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, looking surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTold you it was easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. Well now I\u2019m far less impressed with your cooking prowess,\u201d he says, smirking, and Derek rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee if I ever help <em>you</em> again,\u201d he mutters, and Stiles bumps into him with a grin, herding him into the living room.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, thank you. This is awesome, I have one more meal to cook now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, next time you\u2019re teaching me how to knit,\u201d Derek says, jerking his chin toward the woven basket in the corner, and Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>They collapse down onto the couch, practically on the same cushion, and Stiles flips channels, finally landing on a baseball game. Derek tunes out almost immediately, once again fixated on the lack of space between the two of them. Stiles <em>could </em>have taken a seat on the other end of the couch, or hell, even in the chair. Does that mean anything?</p>\n<p>This is torture.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 arm is hooked over the back of the couch, twisting his body toward Derek and showing off the hollow of his collarbone. Derek has gotten embarrassingly good at cataloguing Stiles\u2019 heartbeat, and he\u2019s calm right now, breathing easily. Is that a good sign? Though Derek is glad that Stiles can\u2019t hear <em>his</em> heartbeat because he\u2019s pretty sure it would be giving him away.</p>\n<p>Derek is still pissed at himself for chickening out last week, when Stiles was in his car. They\u2019d been talking about that movie, the Hugh Jackman one, and it was such a natural segue, it would have been so easy for him to say <em>hey, do you wanna go out?</em> But he\u2019d just\u2026frozen. And then Stiles was out of the car before he could work up the courage.</p>\n<p>\u201cLogan!\u201d Derek blurts out, and Stiles turns to stare at him as if he\u2019s grown an extra limb.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek winces. This is not going according to plan. Again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe movie,\u201d he says with a cough, hoping it\u2019ll clear the awkwardness out of his voice. It doesn\u2019t work. \u201cWe were talking about it. Last week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Right.\u201d Stiles nods several times as he looks at Derek expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna go see it? Maybe Saturday?\u201d he asks, and Stiles nods again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a DC guy over Marvel, honestly, but I heard it was good. So yeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, that was easy.</p>\n<p>Stiles starts fiddling with something on his phone, his lower lip stuck in between his teeth, and he\u2019s not at all acting like Derek just asked him out on a\u2014</p>\n<p>Shit.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs. \u201cI meant like as a date,\u201d he says, forcing himself to keep his voice steady. Stiles freezes and slowly looks up from his phone. His mouth is open, and Derek drags his gaze away, back up to his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly\u2026shit are you <em>serious</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek has a lot of advantages at his disposal for reading people, and yet he still has <em>no </em>idea what Stiles is feeling right now. \u201cUh, yes?\u201d he tries, and Stiles\u2019 heartbeat skyrockets. Okay, that\u2019s probably a good sign.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy luck is not this good,\u201d Stiles says, shaking his head. His eyes are wide, his fingers fiddling with the hem of his shirt, and Derek relaxes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you <em>asshole</em>,\u201d Stiles says with a laugh, punching Derek in the shoulder, but whatever he was going to say next gets interrupted by the front door opening.</p>\n<p>They both turn their heads as Stiles\u2019 dad comes inside, wiping his feet on the mat and shaking the rain off his jacket. \u201cHey, Derek,\u201d he says, and Derek lifts a hand in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, it smells good in here. You staying for dinner?\u201d he asks, but Derek shakes his head as he levers himself off the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I promised my mom I\u2019d be home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles still looks a little shell-shocked, sitting there on the couch with his body curled toward the space Derek just vacated. He doesn\u2019t make a move to get up, so Derek just smirks at him and waves before he slips out the front door.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s phone buzzes in his pocket a few times on the drive home, but he forces himself not to check it until he\u2019s safely parked in front of his house.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Okay, if that was a joke, you are ACTUALLY the biggest asshole ever.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>But I\u2019m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that it wasn\u2019t.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>It wasn't.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>You still haven't given me an answer, though.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Maybe I\u2019m still thinking about it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span><span class=\"x1F641\"><span class=\"hide\">*sad face emoji*</span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Okay, fine, I guess we can go out.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Since you seem really excited about it and all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Dad!\u201d Stiles chirps as he practically skips into the kitchen. He drops two pieces of bread into the toaster and waits, drumming his fingers impatiently against the countertop. His dad is sitting at the table, reading the newspaper as he sips at a cup of coffee, and he gives Stiles a considering look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is up with you?\u201d he asks, and Stiles shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. Saturday, you know. Good day.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad hums, sounding suspicious, and Stiles keeps his gaze fixed on the toaster, willing it to work faster.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny plans for the day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Stiles grabs the toast as soon as it pops and winces as it burns his fingertips. \u201cJust going to a movie tonight. Nothing big.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah? With who? Scott and everyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows and very carefully spreads peanut butter on his toast as he avoids his dad\u2019s gaze. \u201cUh, no. Just Derek. You know\u2026casual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, a date,\u201d his dad says flatly, and Stiles sputters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he exclaims. A thick drop of peanut butter flings across the counter, and he swipes it up with his thumb. \u201cNo! No. Definitely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going to a movie? On a Saturday night? With no one else?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad stares at him, one eyebrow raised, and Stiles sighs, folding like a cheap paper plate. \u201cYes, fine. It\u2019s a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad\u2019s smirking a little, that look he gets when he successfully manages to pry something out of Stiles. \u201cAre you two dating?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d Stiles shrugs as he takes a bite of his toast. \u201cIt\u2019s our first date. But, you know, hopefully.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he seems like a nice enough kid. And your curfew stands\u201410 on school nights, 11 otherwise. But I can be flexible if you do a good job letting me know where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says quickly, nodding.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do we need to have the safe sex talk again?\u201d he asks, painfully earnest, and Stiles squeezes his eyes shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>, no,\u201d he says, choking briefly on a mouthful of toast. \u201cNo. I\u2019m good, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles got the \u201cstandard\u201d sex talk when he turned 13, and then again during sophomore year when he told his dad that he was bi. His dad gave him a big hug and said he loved him no matter what\u2014overall, a very touching father-son moment. And then he came back two days later with <em>pamphlets</em>, talking about things like lube and saying things like <em>just because you don\u2019t have to worry about pregnancy, son, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s automatically safe</em>, and Stiles would honestly just like to forget that it ever happened. \u201cNo,\u201d he says again, wincing at the memory. \u201cJust\u2026no.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad grins, as if making his son uncomfortable is his greatest joy in life. Hell, it probably is.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>So\u2026what time for that movie tonight?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>We are still going out, right?

He throws on his favorite jeans and the shirt Lydia recommended, all the while trying to ignore how naked he feels without a hoodie or plaid overshirt. He thinks about doing something with his hair, but honestly, it\u2019ll probably be better if he doesn\u2019t even go down that road.</p>\n<p>He attempts to tip-toe past where his dad\u2019s watching a baseball game from the couch, but he calls out without even moving his head. \u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>He bites his lip with a silent curse and backtracks, hanging onto the door jamb. \u201cYep?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad twists around to look at him, and Stiles freezes. \u201cYou look nice, have fun,\u201d he says finally, and Stiles relaxes. \u201cTell Derek I say hello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, will do, thanks Dad!\u201d he calls out, darting out the front door before his dad can demand that Derek come inside. He checks his phone, shivering as the breeze brushes over his bare arms, and doesn\u2019t see a last-minute \u201cjust kidding, I would never date you\u201d text from Derek. Thank god.</p>\n<p>At 7:28, Stiles spots the Camaro turning onto his street and hesitates for a second, wondering if this is going to be weird. But then he shakes his head and makes himself step forward. It\u2019s just <em>Derek</em>, they hang out all the time.</p>\n<p>Derek glides to a stop in the driveway and looks like he\u2019s making to get out of the car, but Stiles motions for him to stay put as he jogs over. What the hell is Derek going to do if he gets out of the car? Hug him? Open the door for him? Any and all options are awkward as fuck.</p>\n<p>So Stiles opens his <em>own </em>door, thanks very much, and plops down in the passenger seat, just like usual. He\u2019s just going to pretend that this is one of their normal hangouts. No need to get nervous.</p>\n<p>But then he twists, gets a full view of Derek, and promptly freaks out.</p>\n<p>Derek looks <em>good</em>, even better than usual\u2014which is saying a lot, let\u2019s be real\u2014in a tight purple Henley, with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows. (And one more button open than normal, Stiles thinks. He\u2019s pretty sure he doesn\u2019t usually see that much chest hair.) He also smells amazing, and something about his gaze is different, too\u2014more serious, maybe. <em>Sexier</em>, definitely.</p>\n<p>Stiles attempts to swallow. Why is mouth suddenly so <em>dry</em>? \u201cUh, hello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d Derek\u2019s gaze skates over him, pausing at his shoulders, and Stiles flushes. What the fuck is wrong with him, he usually doesn\u2019t <em>blush</em> when Derek looks at him. He groans and covers his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d he says, from behind his hands, and Derek snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. So do you. Obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says defiantly, dropping his hands back down into his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cLie,\u201d Derek says easily as he backs out of the driveway. Something so routine shouldn\u2019t look so sexy, and Stiles curses him in his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, he curses him out loud, too, but Derek just laughs.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels safe in the dark, quiet shadows of Derek\u2019s car, especially now that he has free rein to stare freely at Derek, at the sharp lines of his face as the streetlights flash past. He wishes the drive were longer, but soon enough Derek\u2019s pulling into the movie theater parking lot and leading them inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already bought the tickets,\u201d Derek says gruffly, and Stiles grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome, thanks,\u201d he says, backing toward the concession line. \u201cThen I\u2019m getting the snacks because I don\u2019t know about you, but I need popcorn. You want anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek trails after him and scans the candy behind the counter. \u201cJunior Mints.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJunior Mints, really?\u201d He tugs his wallet out of his back pocket. \u201cHow old <em>are</em> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek says, frowning at him, and Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>Derek is surprisingly picky about where they sit in the theater, and he considers and rejects several spots before finally settling in the middle of a row near the back. Stiles promptly props his feet up on the empty seat in front of him and starts in on the popcorn.</p>\n<p>He whispers through the previews, offering pointed commentary on which movies he wants to see and which look dumb, and even though Derek doesn\u2019t offer up many opinions of his own, he at least seems decently entertained by Stiles\u2019 constant blathering.</p>\n<p>And then, about 20 minutes into the movie, Derek <em>actually</em> pulls the whole arm-on-the-back-of-the-seat, fake-stretch move, and Stiles can't help the little burst of giggles that erupts out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek snaps, looking adorably confused as he pulls his arm back, and Stiles waves his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. Come back.\u201d Stiles reaches for Derek\u2019s arm, but he crosses them tightly over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tugs at Derek\u2019s bicep, but <em>damn</em> he\u2019s strong. His arms don\u2019t budge. \u201cI mean, we could do it this way,\u201d he tries instead, sitting up a little straighter before slinging his arm over Derek's shoulders, \u201cbut it\u2019ll be <em>way</em> comfier the other way because you're like an inch taller than me, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek ducks out from underneath Stiles\u2019 arm with a sigh and wraps his own arm around him instead. \u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, I was right,\u201d Stiles says delightedly, wiggling as he keeps babbling in a vain attempt to distract from his nervousness. \u201cThis is much comfier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was only because you looked cold,\u201d Derek grumbles.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Lydia</em>, Stiles thinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says mockingly. He pats Derek\u2019s thigh and after a second, dares to leave his hand there.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk for the rest of the movie, and as they file out, Stiles catches Derek wiping his face on the shoulder of his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you cry?\u201d he asks, and Derek glares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was <em>moving</em>,\u201d he snaps. Stiles has to bite his lip to keep from laughing, just because Derek looks so affronted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like dudes who cry,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cSo it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, but he <em>does</em> take Stiles\u2019 hand and wind their fingers together. \u201cYou, uh, wanna get some ice cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles says, trying not to convey how freaked out he is by holding Derek\u2019s hand. Not that it\u2019s <em>bad</em>\u2014just the opposite, actually, it\u2019s a little freaky how normal it feels.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an ice cream shop in the same shopping center as the movie theater, one of those old-timey ones with stools at the counter and red vinyl booths, and Derek buys them both ice cream. They walk as they eat, strolling over to the little park across the street and discussing their upcoming calc test.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a bit of a mess there,\u201d Derek says, pointing, and Stiles winces.</p>\n<p>He really should have learned his lesson about cones\u2014he\u2019s not good with messy things in the first place, and then to make matters worse, he talks too much, giving the ice cream more time to melt and causing an even bigger mess. Plus, it\u2019s a warm night, which all in all means he has mint chocolate chip goodness dripping all down his hand and even onto his arm. He doesn\u2019t want any to get on his jeans, so he uses his tongue to circle the bottom edge of the cone and then starts laving at his wrist.</p>\n<p>Derek growls\u2014actually <em>growls</em>, what the fuck, that is hotter than it has any right to be\u2014and grabs Stiles\u2019 wrist, bringing his hand to his mouth. Stiles\u2019 eyes go wide as Derek licks up the spilled ice cream, running his tongue along the side of his index finger and actually sucking the pad of his thumb into his mouth. By the time he finally pulls back, Stiles is pretty sure he\u2019s forgotten how to breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cPayback,\u201d Derek says, seemingly nonchalant as he licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles breathes. \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t deterring me at <em>all</em>, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts and opens his mouth to say something, but Stiles can\u2019t take it anymore and just <em>flings</em> himself toward him, landing in a clumsy kiss as Derek\u2019s free hand comes up to steady him. It gets smoother after a second, once they get their heads tilted in the correct directions, and Stiles can\u2019t even believe this is happening.</p>\n<p>He crowds even closer, Derek\u2019s body so wonderfully solid against him, and searches for Derek\u2019s free hand with his own. His hand is sticky, he knows, from spit and ice cream, but Derek tangles their fingers together anyway and squeezes. The pure sweetness of it is what makes Stiles\u2019 breath hitch, and he has to pull back to suck in a proper breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow.\u201d He leans back a little to look at them, small splatters of ice cream dotting their clothes and arms and hands. \u201cWe look like we have some kinda food kink or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek huffs and leans forward to kiss him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this your way of telling me that you <em>are</em> kinky? Because you know the rule, right?\u201d Stiles says, getting the words out between breathless kisses. \u201cYou gotta disclose your kinks before like the, uh, the third date. That way I get to decide whether I want to cut ties or not. You know, depending. I\u2019m not saying I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek kisses him harder then, sucking his lower lip into his mouth, and Stiles shuts up, to encourage that behavior as much as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d Derek pauses, shaking his head, and Stiles snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpastic? Too talkative? Annoying as fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty great,\u201d he says instead, his face painfully earnest. Stiles swallows. Derek\u2019s eyes are bright even in the moonlight, and Stiles is pretty sure he can\u2019t look directly at them, they\u2019re just too pretty.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was\u2014that was a very nice thing for you to say. And now I\u2019m going to kiss you again before I say something stupid to screw it all up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does, and Derek laughs, this tiny exhalation of breath against Stiles\u2019 lips that he wants to hear again and again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019re pretty great, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you said you were gonna stop talking,\u201d Derek murmurs, and Stiles grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that was a lie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tosses the rest of his cone in the trash\u2014it\u2019s pretty much a lost cause now, anyway\u2014and Derek bravely ducks back into the ice cream shop for a fistful of napkins. Once he determines that they\u2019re clean enough for the Camaro, they walk back to the car, hand-in-hand, and Derek drives him home. He even lets him pick the radio station, which in Stiles\u2019 opinion is the highest form of chivalry.</p>\n<p>He debates about whether he should direct them to a spot where they can make out some more, but before he can make up his mind, Derek is pulling into his driveway.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he says softly, wrapping one warm hand around the nape of Stiles\u2019 neck and tugging him forward over the center console.</p>\n<p>Stiles goes eagerly and almost falls into Derek, bracing a hand on his thigh for balance. The muscle is hard and corded under his fingers, and Stiles shamelessly gropes him a little bit, sliding his hand down to his knee and back up with a squeeze.</p>\n<p>Something flashes in Stiles\u2019 eyes, and while at first he thinks it\u2019s just the clich\u00e9d <em>fireworks</em>, Derek pulls back from the kiss. The flashes are still happening, and Stiles realizes that his dad is flipping the porch light on and off.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d he complains. \u201cHe is not subtle at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs. \u201cYou better go.\u201d He draws his nose up Stiles\u2019 cheek, and Stiles gulps.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Or</em>,\u201d he says eagerly, \u201cwe could keep making out here and see what else he comes up with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d really rather not make an enemy of your dad on our first date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo since you said <em>first</em> date, does that imply that you want a second?\u201d he asks, and Derek just gives him a look. \u201cWell, your <em>eyebrows</em> are saying no, so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek growls at him again and draws him into another fierce kiss, pulling away only after a sharp nip at Stiles\u2019 lower lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, a little shaky. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither of them move, though, and this time it\u2019s Stiles who closes the distance between them and kisses him again. He\u2019s definitely going to have beard burn all over his face tomorrow, but he really just doesn\u2019t give a shit.</p>\n<p>They finally manage to separate themselves, and Stiles waves embarrassingly as Derek backs out of the driveway.</p>\n<p>His dad\u2019s in the kitchen, nonchalantly pouring a glass of water and doing a terrible job of pretending that he isn\u2019t just waiting up for Stiles. \u201cSo how was your date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d Stiles says. He\u2019s trying to keep his face relatively passive, but he\u2019s probably doing a shitty job at it.</p>\n<p>His dad tilts his head. \u201cIs that ice cream on your neck?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grimaces and slaps a hand over his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d he calls out over his shoulder as he takes the stairs two at a time. He showers off the stickiness, jerks off <em>again</em>, and falls asleep with a goofy grin on his face.</p>\n<p>Derek spends the rest of the weekend in a low-key freakout. It's not that he didn't have a good time on their date\u2014quite the opposite, actually\u2014but it\u2019s actually sinking in that he really likes Stiles. That <em>should</em> be a good thing, sure, but at the beginning, he\u2019d also liked Paige. And Kate. And neither of those turned out very well, to say the least.</p>\n<p>So he broods all day Sunday, thinking in circles about whether or not he\u2019s stupid to be falling for someone again. But maybe <em>that\u2019s</em> silly because for all that Stiles seemed to enjoy their date, maybe he didn\u2019t. Maybe he had a terrible time and has no desire to see Derek again and therefore all this ruminating is for moot.</p>\n<p>See? Thinking in circles.</p>\n<p>Derek has somehow managed to keep this whole thing a secret from his parents, which he knows is a terrible idea for a variety of reasons, but he\u2019s just not ready to talk about it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not ready to talk to <em>anyone</em> about it, apparently, not even Stiles, because as soon as he catches a whiff of Stiles\u2019 scent in the hallway on Monday morning, he darts into their physics classroom before he even spots him. Stiles strides into the classroom with a huge grin\u2014okay, maybe he <em>did</em> have a good time on the date\u2014but Derek just offers him a tight smile and looks back down at the homework he\u2019s about to turn in, pretending to be proofreading for errors that he knows aren\u2019t there.</p>\n<p>Thankfully it\u2019s not a lab day, but they still don\u2019t talk at all, which is definitely strange for them. Stiles\u2019 scent slowly sours, and Derek hates himself more with every passing moment. <em>Maybe he\u2019ll just think I\u2019m not out yet</em>, he thinks, then wants to punch himself in the face. <em>Stiles deserves better than you. Obviously.</em></p>\n<p>As soon as the bell rings, Derek makes some terrible excuse about needing to print something out\u2014<em>what</em>\u2014and runs out of the room. He hides in the library during lunch\u2014<em>coward, coward, coward</em>\u2014and cuts out of his last period three minutes early so he can be one of the first ones out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p>So all in all, not Derek\u2019s most courageous day.</p>\n<p>He trudges through the front door of his house and runs into his mom in the kitchen. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, sweetie,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a session with Lisa in 10 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>, he thinks, hanging his head and running a hand through his hair. \u201cRight. I didn\u2019t forget,\u201d he says, knowing that his mom will hear the lie but not really caring.</p>\n<p>Lisa is his therapist. Turns out that when their son secretly dates an older woman who ends up being a literal criminal, his parents get worried.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d His mom puts a hand on his arm. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve been a little down these past couple of days.\u201d</p>\n<p>His parents also care incessantly about his well-being, which he supposes is equally true for kids who don\u2019t have a history of making terrible, life-threatening romantic decisions.</p>\n<p>He nods with a little smile, so he doesn\u2019t have to explicitly lie, and gives his mom a half-hug before grabbing an apple and heading up to his room. It wasn\u2019t easy to find a therapist who is also in the know about the supernatural, even with his mother\u2019s vast network, and now that they\u2019ve moved, he talks with Lisa over Skype.</p>\n<p>Derek hated it, at first. He attempted to worm his way out of it when he turned 18, but <em>that</em> got shot down pretty quickly, with the most typical parental response of all time: \u201cas long as you're living under our roof, you're living under our rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least now he only has to talk to Lisa once a month. He likes her enough, sure, but it's still never exactly <em>pleasant</em>.</p>\n<p>They start the session and go through the standard list of questions that Derek hates\u2014<em>no</em>, he\u2019s not hearing voices, he swears\u2014even though he knows she\u2019s supposed to ask them, or whatever.</p>\n<p>She makes pleasant small talk, asking about the first month of school and what he did this weekend, and he swallows. \u201cI went out on a date this weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Lisa\u2019s surprised, she hides it well. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Who\u2019s the lucky person?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA guy from school, Stiles. He\u2019s\u2014nice. Different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you went out on a date with a guy you like. Why do you seem down about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cI like Stiles. But I liked Kate, too, so it\u2019s hard to see this going well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d she asks with a frown, and he shrugs again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really trust myself. I\u2019m clearly not a very good judge of character.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hums. \u201cWhy did you like Kate? What drew you to her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grimaces, looks down at where his thumbnail is tracing along the grain of his jeans. \u201cI don't want to talk about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lisa doesn\u2019t respond, instead drawing out the silence to an uncomfortable length, but Derek doesn't say anything to fill it. He knows that trick.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d she relents after a minute, holding up her hands. \u201cThen what about Stiles? Does he make you feel the same way? Any of the same qualities?</p>\n<p>Derek thinks about it. Kate always made him feel like they were doing the wrong thing\u2014sneaking around, just the two of them against the world. Which, after 16-plus years as a straight-laced kid, was fun\u2026for a while, at least, until it very much wasn't.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says finally. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later that night, after dinner, he texts Stiles a simple <em>hey</em>. It\u2019s over an hour before he gets a response.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Hey</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>I\u2019m sorry about today, I was in a weird mood.

He hates seeing Stiles so wary and toned-down, especially because of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d He thrusts out the package of s\u2019mores Pop-Tarts that he brought as a peace offering, and Stiles laughs a little as he takes it, ripping open the foil.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hands one of them to Derek, who takes a bite just to delay what he has to say. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cFor\u2026for avoiding you like that yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that was kinda shitty,\u201d Stiles says frankly, and Derek forces himself to nod. \u201cAre you\u2014do you want to go out again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, as fast as he can get the word out. \u201cDefinitely. Do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, but it seems a little more hesitant than Derek would expect. \u201cAre you, um\u2026are you not out or something? Is that what the whole avoiding me thing was about?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve, uh, had a couple bad relationships,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cAnd I just\u2014got a little freaked out, I guess. Stuck in my own head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hums around a mouthful of Pop-Tart. \u201cBut you still want to date me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, because my crush on you is still, like, of epic proportions. But I\u2019m gonna make you take me out to dinner to make up for yesterday\u2019s emotional trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGladly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows his last bite and sucks briefly at his thumb. \u201cCool. You wanna go make out somewhere, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a snort, Derek bends down to pick up his backpack, then laces his fingers with Stiles\u2019. \u201cI have a key to the darkroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, really?\u201d he says, brightening. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go in there and see how all that works. Could you teach me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek bites back a smile. \u201cIf you want, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn second thought,\u201d Stiles says, his gaze going a little hazy, \u201cmaking out now. Teaching out later.\u201d</p>\n<p>They end up being three minutes late to physics, and Stiles\u2019 grin is practically incandescent.</p>\n<p>Derek never really thought he\u2019d be a part of one of those sappy, cliched high school couples, but he and Stiles hold hands all throughout lunch and then spend almost 10 minutes saying goodbye to each other in the parking lot. It\u2019s objectively gross, but the grin doesn\u2019t slide off Derek\u2019s face until he\u2019s halfway home, when the sirens start up behind him.</p>\n<p>Fuck, fuck, <em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>He pulls over carefully and grimaces when the cruiser stops right behind him. Derek reaches for his wallet then freezes. Wait, he\u2019s supposed to wait until they ask for that, right?</p>\n<p>He rolls his window down and attempts to breathe, his hands twisting on the leather of the steering wheel. The sound of boots approaching is ominous, to say the least, and the feeling gets even worse when he sees that it\u2019s<em> Stiles\u2019</em> <em>dad. </em>Oh, god. Stiles probably told him what a jerk Derek was yesterday, and now he\u2019s here to kill him. Great.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, hello there, Derek,\u201d he says, his voice deceptively cheery as he stoops into view, and Derek swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know what the speed limit is on this road, son?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, 40, sir.\u201d He tries as hard as he can not to phrase it like a question.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff hums. \u201cAnd do you know how fast you were going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I really don\u2019t think it was above 40. Sir,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d he shoots back. \u201cIt was 42.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wants to argue\u2014is he seriously going to get a ticket for going <em>two</em> miles over?\u2014but he\u2019s smart enough to know that would be a terrible idea. He nods instead, biting his lip. \u201cSorry, Sheriff. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>He makes a little noise, scribbling on his pad, and Derek wants to <em>die</em>. His parents are going to kill him if he gets a ticket, and he needs them in a good mood before he tells them about Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he says finally. He stuffs his notepad back in his pocket and rests one arm on the top of Derek\u2019s car. \u201cI\u2019m just going to give you a warning, since this is the first time I\u2019ve pulled you over. But <em>believe</em> me, it would behoove you to drive a little bit safer when my son is in your car.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks up at him, certain that there\u2019s a deeper meaning hidden in there somewhere. \u201cUh, yes. Yes, of course, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d He taps the top of the car before backing away. \u201cHave a good night, son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Derek calls out belatedly, and the Sheriff waves over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>With a harsh exhale, Derek slumps back in his seat and waits for the cruiser to pass him before he pulls out his phone.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>Your dad just pulled me over.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>WHAT.

Stiles struggles in his grip and winces when his hipbone smacks against the edge of the riser. \u201cI\u2019m all sweaty, I smell gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d He traces a line up Stiles\u2019 neck with his nose. \u201cNot to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeirdo,\u201d Stiles says fondly. He cups Derek\u2019s scruffy cheeks in his palms and kisses him soundly. They kiss for a minute, while Stiles tries to remember that they\u2019re in a public place, on school grounds, and therefore he <em>probably </em>shouldn\u2019t straddle Derek right now.</p>\n<p>He pulls back when the impulse gets too great, and Derek drops a hand to his hip. \u201cSo my parents want you to come over for dinner this weekend,\u201d he says, his mouth twisted into a grimace, and Stiles freezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cO-<em>kay</em>,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me, but why do you look like your dog just died? Are your parents awful? Are you secretly ashamed of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns dramatically, and Derek snorts. \u201cNo, nothing like that,\u201d he says with a shake of his head. He hesitates. \u201cThey\u2019re just\u2026a little intense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell now I\u2019m officially terrified, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Is there a dress code for dinner?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>...</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>Seriously?

It\u2019s a somewhat limp-looking $8 bouquet from the grocery store, but hey\u2014he\u2019s only 18, and his summer part-time job at the bookstore doesn\u2019t exactly leave him rolling in dough. It\u2019s the thought that counts, anyway, he\u2019s pretty sure, and he\u2019d like to make a good impression on Derek\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p>Stiles has been on a couple dates before, but he\u2019s never officially \u201cdated\u201d anyone long enough to meet their parents. He\u2019s thrilled to be there with Derek, though, even if his weird reaction after their first date sent Stiles into a minor emotional tailspin. He was a little startled to find out that Derek has apparently had relationships that were bad enough to put him off of new ones\u2014how is that possible, they\u2019re only 18?!\u2014but he <em>likes</em> Derek, a lot, and is happy to give him the benefit of the doubt. Derek has shown no indication that he wants to talk about those relationships, at <em>all</em>, but Stiles will hopefully pry it out of him sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>He follows the directions Derek gives him and is suddenly glad for the Jeep as he bumps up the winding dirt road. He\u2019s never actually been to Derek\u2019s house before. Whenever they get together to do \u201chomework\u201d\u2014or actual homework because they really are in a lot of hard classes\u2014they go to Stiles\u2019 house.</p>\n<p>He parks next to the Camaro and takes a minute in the car to calm down. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d Stiles mutters. He wipes his hands on his jeans and grabs the flowers before he makes himself leave the safety of his car.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s house is really nice, big and sprawling and all secluded in the woods. As soon as Stiles hops up onto the porch, still a good three strides from the front door, it opens, and he almost falls on his ass in surprise. He catches himself by grabbing onto the porch railing and then goes still when he looks up.</p>\n<p>All three of them, Derek\u2019s parents and Cora, are crowded in the doorway, staring down at him, and Stiles suddenly feels not only underdressed but under\u2026under-<em>everything</em>. They\u2019re all as attractive as Derek and Laura, tall and dark-haired with beautiful bone structure. Derek\u2019s dad has a beard, too, peppered with gray, and goddamn, Derek is going to be one handsome motherfucker when he\u2019s old. That\u2019s probably an awkward thought, and Stiles internally grimaces.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mom finally smiles warmly at him and breaks the weird tension. \u201cHello, there, you must be Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>He coughs and lets go of his trusty porch rail, straightening up and brushing his hands on his pants before he shakes her hand and then Mr. Hale\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Hale, Mr. Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTalia,\u201d she corrects, and he nods politely, already planning to ignore <em>that</em> request. He\u2019s making out with her son, like a <em>lot</em>, so until he knows her a little better she is most definitely Mrs. Hale. \u201cThis is my husband Aaron, and this is Cora.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shoots Cora a smile, which worryingly, she doesn\u2019t return. He\u2019s seen her around school, but they\u2019ve never actually talked. He wishes that Laura were here, so at least he\u2019d have someone else on his side.</p>\n<p>They usher him inside, and he skirts around them to stand awkwardly in the foyer. They\u2019re all smiling at him, but it\u2019s a little\u2026<em>predatory</em>, almost. He smiles back, nervously, and is about to ask where Derek is when he comes trotting down the large staircase. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Stiles says gratefully. He clenches his hands into fists to keep from reaching out.</p>\n<p>Derek touches his arm gently and turns them a little so that his body is shielding Stiles from the rest of his family. \u201cDid you bring flowers?\u201d he asks lowly, with a little smirk that probably means he\u2019s going to make fun of Stiles at the earliest opportunity.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>polite</em>,\u201d he hisses, then leans around Derek to hand the bouquet to Mrs. Hale with what he hopes is a smile. \u201cThese are for you. Thank you for having me over for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, dear, thank you,\u201d she says, taking them with a smile. \u201cDerek, why don\u2019t you show Stiles around? We\u2019ll have dinner in just a few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives Stiles\u2019 hand a reassuring squeeze and obeys. The house appears to be as nice on the inside as it is on the outside, but Stiles only gets to see the den before Derek tugs him through the mud room and out the back door.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he says, his voice barely above a whisper, and Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo promises.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine. Everything is fine.\u201d Derek squeezes his hand again before dropping it and cupping Stiles\u2019 face. He kisses him, just a quick peck, and Stiles grasps at his waist. \u201cRelax, your heart is pounding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, is it that loud?\u201d Stiles asks. He holds his hand over his chest and wills it to calm down. Derek smiles and covers his hand with his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a lucky guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a great backyard, by the way,\u201d Stiles says, trying to distract himself by looking around. There\u2019s a large clearing between the house and the edge of the woods, scattered through with a couple large picnic tables and a few large trees that look perfect for climbing. \u201cHow many bones did you break falling out of those trees?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiles again and kisses him once more. \u201cJust my arm once. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a longing look to the little breakfast nook off the kitchen, but they have dinner in the formal dining room. He gets to sit next to Derek and relaxes when Derek\u2019s hand lands on his knee. He remembers to put his napkin on his lap, at least, and thankfully there\u2019s only one fork next to his plate.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mom starts the serving with a large platter, piled high with sliced steak. \u201cDo you like the family silver, Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at her, then down at his silverware. She\u2019s staring at him, her eyes hard, and he has no idea what he did to make her dislike him all of a sudden. \u201cYes,\u201d he squeaks, then clears his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom,\u201d Derek says, sounding tired. \u201cLeave him alone. He doesn\u2019t\u2026I told you already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has no idea what <em>that\u2019s</em> about, but Mrs. Hale hums and finishes serving everyone else.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Derek tells us you\u2019re interested in Berkeley?\u201d she asks, and Stiles nods several times as he swallows. Why do people always ask questions while you\u2019re chewing?</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, after a quick gulp of water. \u201cIt\u2019s a great school, obviously, and I\u2019d get the benefit of in-state tuition, which would be really helpful, while staying close to my dad. I mean, if I can get in, that is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe got an almost perfect score on his SATs,\u201d Derek chimes in, and Stiles whips his head around to stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell did you know that? I didn\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cI asked around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout my exam scores?\u201d he asks, raising an eyebrow, and Derek shrugs again, with a little smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout you in general.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019m scared of what you heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it was all bad, I just ignored it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek has that deadpan face on, the one with the eyebrows, and Stiles just rolls his eyes while everyone else laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost a full moon,\u201d Mr. Hale comments, leaning back in his chair to look out the window. \u201cWhat do you think about that, Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d He takes a bite of his mashed potatoes to buy himself some time. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty? My dad\u2019s the sheriff, you know, and he always says there\u2019s more mayhem and such on full moon nights. I don\u2019t know if I buy that, though, I\u2019d need to see some data.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Hale hums, swirling his wine in his glass before he takes a sip. \u201cAnd how long have you been in Beacon Hills?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as I can remember,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cMy dad was a deputy here for a long time before he was elected sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny other family?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cNope, not really. A few cousins scattered around that we don\u2019t see very often, but it\u2019s mostly just me and my dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>That seems to put an end to their line of questioning, and they move onto the far more innocuous topics of the weather and the Giants for the rest of dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help with the dishes?\u201d Stiles offers\u2014he\u2019s really invested in making a good first impression here\u2014but Mr. Hale shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Stiles, I can take care of it. Thank you, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek said you two have a lab report to finish, right?\u201d Mrs. Hale asks, and Stiles nods. \u201cYou two are excused, then. Derek, there are some cookies in the kitchen that I baked earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and hops up, seemingly as eager to escape this as Stiles is, but his mom catches his wrist as he passes behind her chair. She whispers something in his ear, and strangely, Cora starts laughing, even though she\u2019s sitting on the other side of the table. Derek\u2019s cheeks are red when he pulls away from her, but he doesn\u2019t say anything in response and just ushers Stiles into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>He gestures to a glass container next to the fridge, and Stiles opens it to find a delicious-looking pile of chocolate chip cookies. He grabs several, setting them down on the plate that Derek helpfully holds out. \u201cYour family\u2019s a little weird,\u201d he says lowly, and Derek winces, gesturing at him to <em>shhh</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he hisses. He knows how to keep his voice down, he swears, no one can hear them. \u201cI like them, though. It\u2019s a cool weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, but he looks fond. \u201cYeah, well, you would know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, thanks, boo,\u201d he says with a grin, and Derek rolls his eyes <em>again</em>. Twice in 10 seconds\u2014might be a new record.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d he grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo late, boo,\u201d Stiles says easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo upstairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, yeah, baby, tell me what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyebrows are fully set in <em>pained</em> mode, and his mouth is twisted. \u201cOh my <em>god</em>, stop talking,\u201d he whispers harshly. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hustles Stiles up the stairs and into his bedroom, where he seems to relax after he closes the door behind them. Stiles pokes around a little bit, but Derek\u2019s room is pretty neat, with shelves stuffed with books and only a few items of clothing littering the plush rug.</p>\n<p>\u201cLab report first,\u201d Derek says, snatching the plate of cookies away, and Stiles gapes at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaskmaster,\u201d he mutters, but he obediently takes his laptop out of his backpack and sits down at the desk. Derek stretches out on his stomach on the bed and they work in silence for a while, Derek scratching out calculations while Stiles starts writing their conclusion. He\u2019s the <em>master</em> of bullshit, after all, which was basically invented for high school lab reports.</p>\n<p>Almost an hour later, Stiles climbs onto Derek\u2019s green-and-gray comforter\u2014because of <em>course</em> he makes his bed\u2014and straddles his back, slumping down over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracting me,\u201d Derek says under his breath, and Stiles grins into his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d He watches for a minute as Derek works, his handwriting small and neat. \u201cYou wanna know something weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hums. \u201cNot really, but I have a feeling you\u2019ll tell me anyway,\u201d he says absently, not even flinching when Stiles swats him on the back of the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wrote, like, two pages without getting distracted <em>once</em>,\u201d he says proudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took your meds today, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah, but it usually kinda wears off by now. And still\u2014it\u2019s not usually <em>this</em> good.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was really weird, actually. Even with the Adderall, Stiles is used to a constant low hum of distraction, but here, sitting at Derek\u2019s desk, it was like something switched in his brain and he\u2019d entered another dimension, one where his brain worked like it was supposed to.</p>\n<p>Derek is still working and doesn\u2019t seem as impressed by Stiles\u2019 accomplishment as he should be, so Stiles huffs and rests a little bit more of his weight onto him. \u201cI want cookies.\u201d He drops a kiss at the nape of Derek\u2019s neck. \u201cHave I been good enough for cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts and finally pushes his notebook away, twisting under Stiles so that they\u2019re face-to-face. Stiles moves to sit up\u2014the cookies are on Derek\u2019s nightstand, and he <em>really</em> wants some\u2014but Derek takes Stiles\u2019 hips in that strong grip, holding him in place. He cranes his neck up, seeking a kiss, and Stiles\u2019 eyes light up as he ducks down that extra inch.</p>\n<p><em>Or this</em>, he thinks, humming happily. <em>This is good, too</em>.</p>\n<p>This is good, this is familiar, and Stiles slowly lets his weight slump fully onto Derek\u2019s body. One of Derek\u2019s legs moves to the side, hooking over the back of Stiles\u2019 to give him more room. The added friction is amazing, and Stiles groans, the sound muffled into Derek\u2019s mouth as he deepens the kiss.</p>\n<p>Careful not to knee Derek in the balls or something, Stiles rearranges his weight so that he has one free hand and immediately finds Derek\u2019s arm, squeezing his bicep. Stiles is strong from lacrosse, in a wiry way, but Derek is seriously jacked and it makes Stiles a little crazy. When he gets Derek\u2019s shirt off for the first time in bed, he\u2019s probably going to self-combust from the hotness of it all.</p>\n<p>Stiles has come to wear his beard burn like a badge of pride, and he quickly twists his head to give Derek more room as he starts to kiss down his jaw. Derek kind of has a thing for necks, it seems like, but Stiles certainly doesn\u2019t mind, and he takes advantage of Derek\u2019s distraction to slide a hand up under his shirt and just sort of pet embarrassingly at his abs.</p>\n<p>He starts to ruck up Derek\u2019s shirt, but he barely gets anywhere before he finds himself unceremoniously dumped to the side. Derek has flipped over, his face shoved into the pillow, before Stiles can even blink, and he freezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says softly after a second, resting his hand on Derek\u2019s back. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and says something, but it\u2019s too muffled into the pillow for Stiles to understand. He sits next to his hip, resting one hand on Derek\u2019s back and using the other to scratch gently through his hair. Stiles desperately wants to pry\u2014he knows Derek has had sex with a girl but not a guy, so maybe this is some kind of gay-sex-related freakout?\u2014but he manages to keep his mouth shut, barely.</p>\n<p>He waits a few more minutes, until Derek shifts onto his back. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, his gaze determined even as he bites his lip. His hair is stuck up in clumps, from when Stiles\u2019 hands had been in it, and frankly, it\u2019s insanely adorable. \u201cI got a little, uh, overwhelmed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, that\u2019s a freaking <em>compliment</em>,\u201d Stiles says proudly, and he laughs when Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cThat little ol\u2019 me could make you all hot and bothered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not little,\u201d Derek grumbles, tugging him down so they\u2019re lying next to each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and neither are you.\u201d Stiles swings one leg over Derek\u2019s and tucks his head under his chin. \u201cHey, can you reach the cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs and obediently reaches over to the nightstand.</p>\n<p>Derek lets Stiles press him up against the driver\u2019s side door of the Jeep, but he pulls away from the kiss after only a few seconds. After all, he can\u2019t exactly tell Stiles that his whole family is definitely listening and probably also watching.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for coming to dinner,\u201d he says lowly, and Stiles grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cI survived. And I don\u2019t even think your family hates me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey definitely don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>(The bar isn\u2019t high, but Stiles doesn\u2019t need to know that.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, unable to resist leaning forward for one more kiss. \u201cDrive safe, text me when you get home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorrywart,\u201d Stiles teases, but he\u2019s smiling as he gently pushes Derek back and climbs into the Jeep.</p>\n<p>Derek waits until he\u2019s disappeared out of view and then trudges back to the house.</p>\n<p>Ideally, he would have kept Stiles a secret from his parents for a little while longer, just to avoid the scrutiny, but it\u2019s hard to keep things from them\u2014they keep a pretty close eye on him, anyway, regardless of his mom\u2019s supernatural senses. They figured it out almost immediately after they started dating, and while Derek isn\u2019t positive, he\u2019s pretty sure that they asked Cora to spy on him at school. When they confronted him about it, politely, there were a lot of pointed, earnest looks and enthusiasm that bordered on forced. But overall, the whole ordeal has caused less strife than Derek anticipated. He hasn\u2019t even gotten a lecture on \u201cmaking good choices\u201d yet.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all in the den when he enters the house, and his mom immediately smiles at him. \u201cHe seems like a very nice boy, Derek. You should invite him over again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like that his dad\u2019s the sheriff,\u201d his dad says, without looking up from his book, and Derek snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m so glad to have your approval,\u201d he says, and it comes out sounding a lot less like a joke than he intended.</p>\n<p>Cora looks up from her phone, and she\u2019s got that hard look on her face that makes Derek freeze. \u201cSo you went 0-for-2 on girls and decided to try a boy instead?\u201d she asks, her voice steely, and Derek's jaw drops.</p>\n<p>\u201cCora!\u201d his mom snaps. \u201cThat was uncalled for, apologize to your brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>She huffs and rolls her eyes, pointedly silent as she stands from the couch and heads upstairs. A door slams, loudly, and they all wince.</p>\n<p>Their mom gets up to follow her, but Derek takes a step forward instead. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he says reluctantly. \u201cI should go talk to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>He trots up the stairs and stops in front of Cora\u2019s room with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cCora,\u201d he says softly, tapping his knuckles on the door. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands there for probably about 60 seconds before she finally opens the door a crack. He rolls his eyes at the dramatics and steps inside. Since privacy comes in short supply in a werewolf pack, their soundproofed rooms are their sanctuaries, and Derek doesn\u2019t go into his sisters\u2019 rooms very often.</p>\n<p>Cora\u2019s back in bed already, on her phone again with her back to Derek, and he looks around. He spots a stack of textbooks on her desk and stares at it, realizing that he can\u2019t even remember the last time they really talked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s school going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d she mutters, and Derek grits his teeth. Without giving her time to react, he leaps onto the bed and wraps his arms around her. She lashes out immediately, elbowing him in the gut, but he doesn\u2019t let go. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hisses, and he squeezes harder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hugging you,\u201d he snaps back, \u201cand I\u2019m not letting go until you hug me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>They scuffle for another minute, Derek wincing when Cora\u2019s claws come out, but she finally stills in his arms. It\u2019s quiet for a while, until she shifts and turns her face into his chest. \u201cYou're my big brother,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI thought you were perfect, I thought I could trust you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes are suddenly hot, and he slams them shut. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever said that to you, but I am. For everything that happened and how it affected you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. Both for being a dick and for\u2014for what happened to you. Laura told me more about what actually happened, and that\u2019s just\u2026so shitty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s cheeks flush, and he\u2019d really rather not talk about this with his baby sister. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI forgive you. I know it wasn't your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn't exactly feel worthy of either of those statements, but he just hugs her tighter. \u201cI mean\u2014it kind of was. Everything else that happened, anyway. I know you didn\u2019t want to move.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora snorts. \u201cDon\u2019t even start. She was\u2026I don\u2019t like calling girls bitches, but she was totally a bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek swallows. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I like Stiles,\u201d she admits, and he pulls back to look at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asks, skeptical.</p>\n<p>Cora nods. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d she warns, and Derek laughs. \u201cBut he seems good for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He loosens his grip, but Cora doesn\u2019t move away immediately, just shifts so that her phone is braced on his chest. \u201cWho are you always texting?\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s silent for a long time, and Derek figures she\u2019s not going to tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d she says finally, and his eyes light up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell Mom, I swear,\u201d he says immediately, and she laughs. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I\u2019ll ever tell you,\u201d she says with a snort. \u201cYou\u2019d just beat him up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would not,\u201d he says, but it sounds weak even to his own ears. \u201cIs he cute?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora wrinkles her nose. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not doing this. Get out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls off the bed with a laugh\u2014he\u2019ll take it.</p>\n<p>He goes back to his own room and closes the door carefully behind him before falling into bed face-first and taking a deep whiff of his pillow. He should probably be embarrassed about this, he thinks idly, but it\u2019s not a strong enough thought to make him stop.</p>\n<p>Derek <em>thought </em>he was ready to have Stiles in his room, but he sorely overestimated his own levels of restraint. Because as soon as they were in Derek\u2019s bed, with Stiles\u2019 pleasantly-aroused scent seeping into his sheets, there was no way Derek had enough control to fend off the shift. Blue-balling himself was a more appealing option than a conversation that Derek is <em>not</em> ready to have, and miraculously, Stiles didn\u2019t press the issue.</p>\n<p>Derek flips over onto his back and undoes his jeans, sliding them down his hips just a bit. With the scent still so strong in his bed, all he has to do is close his eyes, and it\u2019s so, so easy to pretend that Stiles is still there with him.</p>\n<p>Just thinking about what could have happened between them\u2014what <em>will </em>happen between them\u2014is enough to get him all the way hard, and once he gives into the temptation to wrap a hand around his dick, everything\u2019s over pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>He hisses, biting his lip as he spills over his hand, and after enjoying the afterglow for a minute, he fumbles for his phone on the nightstand.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>Please tell me you\u2019re home.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Ugh, sorry I forgot to text. <span class=\"x1F641\"><span class=\"hide\">*sad face emoji*</span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>What're you up to?</span>\n</p>\n<p>Derek bites his lip and looks down at himself, thinking about it for a minute before he responds.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>Just jerked off.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>DUDE</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>What the fuck, man, you gotta give me some warning.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Holy shit.

He peels himself out of bed to clean up, tossing the tissue in the trash after a cursory wipe-off and changing into sweatpants.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Oh, Jesus Christ.

Gimme like 10 minutes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Stiles pants. He stumbles to a stop and braces his hands on his knees. Why did he ever decide that running with Derek would be a good idea? \u201cHold up, I need a break. Why are you so freakishly fast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek circles back and stands over him, his hands on his hips. That fucker\u2019s barely even breathing hard. While Stiles\u2019 face is splotchy red and pouring sweat, Derek has just enough of a light sheen to make him look even more attractive. Zero percent of this situation is fair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be faster. You look fast when you\u2019re playing lacrosse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole,\u201d he warns, and Derek smirks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr what?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou\u2019ll chase me down?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a groan, Stiles gives up on standing and drops down onto the ground. Derek sits next to him and leans in, but Stiles shoves a hand in his face and pushes him away. \u201cUgh, no kisses for you. You\u2019re mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek bites his hand, that weirdo, and then laces their fingers together. \u201cYou\u2019re fast,\u201d he says, and Stiles snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, not as fast as you. You should do track or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cRather just hang out with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans again and lays back in the grass, keeping a hold of Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cNow you\u2019re just being nice because you want kisses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose two things could be independent,\u201d he argues. They sit in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the quiet, until Derek squeezes Stiles\u2019 hand. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you took off your shirt I could probably run faster,\u201d Stiles suggests, but Derek just rolls his eyes and stands up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna keep going just a little farther? There\u2019s a nice clearing a little ways down the trail, we can turn around there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is kind of at Derek\u2019s mercy here, anyway\u2014he apparently knows the preserve like the back of his hand, and Stiles has literally no idea where they are. The trail is single-file here, so he falls into step behind Derek, who blessedly seems to be going a little slower now.</p>\n<p>They reach the clearing after maybe five more minutes, and suddenly Stiles feels a jolt, the shock of it nearly throwing him off his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he gasps, holding his hands out for balance, and Derek whirls around, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, what is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has\u2026no idea. He says as much, and Derek\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cI just felt this weird, uh, jolt? Or buzz or something? Super weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Derek asks. He steps closer with his hand outstretched, grabbing onto Stiles\u2019 elbow, and Stiles nods. For the most part, anyway, but he takes a couple deep breaths and props his hands on his hips as he looks around. He doesn\u2019t really see anything strange, except for some weird etchings high up on the bark of a couple of the trees surrounding them. That\u2019s pretty typical for the preserve, though\u2014probably dumb kids carving their initials into hearts or whatever.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyebrows are firmly set in the \u201cconcerned\u201d position. \u201cNo. What did <em>it</em> feel like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost like I\u2019d been struck by lightning? Or hit an electric fence? But <em>not</em>, obviously, and I\u2019ve of course never been struck by lightning, so it\u2019s not like I would know\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles trails off at the confused look on Derek\u2019s face and wrings his hands together before sliding them through his hair. He feels weirdly wired now, like he might just shake out of his skin. He\u2019s been sticking to his Adderall schedule, right?</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d Derek suggests. \u201cSometimes that makes the air all weird. Electricity and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, nodding even as he looks up at the cloudless blue sky. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna head back? Or sit down for a little while or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cNah, I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou lead this time,\u201d Derek says, gesturing to the trail, and Stiles sticks his tongue out at him on the way past.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Try to keep up, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>They run back to the edge of the preserve, and when they reach the point where they started, Derek\u2019s grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou clearly just need a lot of time to warm up.\u201d His arms are folded behind his head while he heaves for breath, and Stiles frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were so much faster on the way back. I had to work hard to stay with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Huh. Stiles shrugs and wipes his face with the hem of his shirt. He\u2019s not even that tired, so he must be in better shape from lacrosse than he thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d Derek says, reaching for him, and Stiles tries to squirm away.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, Derek, no, I\u2019m so gross!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek traps him in place with his arms and noses up his neck, taking a pointed sniff. His scruff tickles, and Stiles laughs. He gives up on trying to get away, because Derek\u2019s arms are like iron bands across his chest, and instead turns around, sliding his hands up under Derek\u2019s shirt. Derek\u2019s skin is damp and tacky with sweat, which should be gross but is really, really not.</p>\n<p>After five minutes of delightfully-sweaty kisses, Derek splits off to head home, and Stiles jogs back to his neighborhood. He\u2019s <em>still</em> jittery when he gets home, and thinking about what Derek said, he checks the weather. Zero percent chance of rain and not even any clouds in the area.</p>\n<p>Weird.</p>\n<p>Stiles jerks off in the shower\u2014in an attempt to combat the jitters as much as anything\u2014and nearly drops his towel in surprise when he gets back to his room. It\u2019s dark outside already, heavy clouds streaking the sky, and windy rain is pounding against his window.</p>\n<p>He huffs an incredulous laugh and shakes his head. Maybe he should be a meteorologist, he thinks wistfully. Low accountability, clearly.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>The Jeep is being temperamental this morning :(</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>You want a ride?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Really?

His jaw is clenched, and Stiles reaches out to poke it. \u201cYou okay? You seem...agitated. Or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek cracks his neck again and twists his hands on the steering wheel. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just slept weird or whatever. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem, dude,\u201d he says easily. \u201cI\u2019ll just shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek actually laughs, even though it sounds a little strained. \u201cNo, you\u2019re fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek continues to be in a weird mood all day, grumpy and surly and reticent, but he seems fairly back to normal by the time Stiles meets him in the parking lot after school. He\u2019s a little more physically affectionate than usual, actually, wrapping Stiles up in a hug and burying his face in his neck, but Stiles isn\u2019t exactly complaining.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna hang out?\u201d He runs his hand through Derek\u2019s hair, but he pulls back with a grimace.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, have to be home early tonight. It\u2019s a family thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Stiles says, trying to hide his disappointment a little. \u201cYou can just drop me off at home, then. Thanks again, by the way, for giving me a ride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have maybe an hour?\u201d Derek suggests, and Stiles grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell in that case, I have an idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d he drawls, and Stiles punches him in the arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust shut up and drive the damn car,\u201d he says, and Derek obeys, the scowl he\u2019s been wearing all day replaced with a tiny grin. \u201cHang a left up here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you directing me to a makeout spot?\u201d Derek asks, one eyebrow cocked, and Stiles snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d he says, with a roll of his eyes. \u201cMy dad knows all the makeout spots. This place is better.\u201d</p>\n<p>They end up parked off the edge of a dirt road deep in the preserve, and Stiles is fairly confident that no one will stumble upon them. He looks at the bucket seats, scratching at his forehead, and Derek tilts his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cBackseat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, definitely.\u201d Stiles contorts himself through the little gap between the two front seats, landing awkwardly on his shoulder. He lets out a little curse and rearranges himself so that he\u2019s flat on his back, then looks up and sees Derek standing outside the car with the door open. \u201cOh. I suppose that would have been easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Derek says dryly, then crawls on top of Stiles, closing the door behind him.</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows. \u201cHello,\u201d he says, curling his hands into fists. Derek looks really big from this angle\u2014imposing, almost, with his broad shoulders seemingly taking up most of the space in the backseat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says softly, complete with a kiss to the tip of Stiles\u2019 nose, and Stiles has to press his lips together to suppress a laugh. Oh, right, this is <em>Derek Hale</em>, the complete and utter puppy dog who is all bark and no bite.</p>\n<p>After drawing Derek down into a proper kiss, Stiles relaxes his hands and slides them up Derek\u2019s chest and around his shoulders to push off the leather jacket. Derek squirms out of it, tossing it blindly down onto the floor, and then carefully sets himself back down over Stiles.</p>\n<p>He yanks at him impatiently, eager for the weight, and then seems to break some sort of spell when he nips at Derek\u2019s lower lip. Derek exhales harshly before deepening the kiss, and Stiles grins, bending his knee to give them more room.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve done their fair share of making out, but Derek has never been this aggressive before\u2014not\u00a0 that Stiles is complaining, not one tiny bit. In fact, it\u2019s really fucking hot the way Derek holds him down, practically devouring Stiles\u2019 mouth.</p>\n<p>Stiles shifts a little bit, aligning their hips better, and yep, wow, that does <em>not</em> feel small, Jesus Christ. He grinds upward, practically on autopilot, making Derek grunt.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this, uh, are you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Stiles breathes, sliding his hands down to clutch hard at Derek\u2019s ass. \u201cKeep going, god, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek groans at that and buries his face in Stiles\u2019 neck, the scratch of his beard making Stiles shiver. The friction is amazing, and Stiles\u2019 blood feels like it\u2019s boiling in his veins. But in the miracle of all miracles, Derek actually comes first, shuddering in Stiles\u2019 arms as he pants hard in his ear. He shifts a little, giving Stiles a thigh to grind against, and holy <em>shit</em>, it\u2019s so hard and muscled and\u2014</p>\n<p>What Stiles hoped would be a manly groan comes out as more of a strained whimper as he arches up against Derek, then collapses in a pile of boneless goo. Derek huffs an incredulous-sounding laugh and slumps down with him, sliding to the side and wrapping a firm arm around Stiles\u2019 waist to keep him in place.</p>\n<p>The post-orgasmic lethargy wears off after a few minutes, leaving Stiles giddy, and he muffles his laugh against Derek\u2019s collarbone. He didn\u2019t even get to see his <em>dick</em>, Jesus Christ, but this was still by far the hottest thing that\u2019s ever happened to him.</p>\n<p>Derek pulls back, with the most adorable mulish frown on his face. \u201cAre you <em>laughing</em> at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the <em>situation</em>, not you,\u201d Stiles hurries to say. He\u2019s all-too-aware of the delicate teenage boy ego. \u201cJust\u2014I was unaware that sex could be so good without taking off any clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, his face smoothing out. \u201cUh, same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSmooth,\u201d Stiles says, and Derek rolls his eyes, even as a blush spreads across his cheeks.</p>\n<p>They lay there for a few more minutes, until Derek lifts his head to look at him and grimaces. Stiles frowns\u2014<em>hello</em>, teenage boy ego here\u2014and opens his mouth to protest, but before he can say anything, Derek gently presses his thumb against his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he asks, instinctively craning his head before realizing that no, he obviously cannot see his own neck. Right. \u201cOh, did you give me a hickey?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyebrows do some sort of complicated dance that Stiles doesn\u2019t follow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve asked. I didn\u2019t even\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, dude, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he says as he prods at his neck. It doesn\u2019t even hurt. \u201cI\u2019m 18, it\u2019ll never be more socially acceptable for me to have a hickey than it is right now. I mean, my dad\u2019ll give me shit, but whatever. He might pull you over again.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins, but Derek just nods solemnly and brushes his fingers over the spot again. \u201cWorth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeirdo,\u201d he says fondly, and he squeezes Derek one more time before starting to squirm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, sitting up with a wince. \u201cWe probably should have thought this through a little better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Derek promises, with a tiny smile, and Stiles grins. Yeah, the sticky boxers are totally worth it.</p>\n<p>When they get to Stiles\u2019 house, Derek reaches for his seatbelt and hesitates. \u201cCould I, uh, come in, just to get cleaned up a little bit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, totally,\u201d Stiles says. Thankfully his dad\u2019s not home. \u201cYou want to borrow a pair of boxers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d he says, looking more grateful that Stiles would have guessed for such a simple favor. \u201cThat would be great, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs and tugs him up the stairs by the hand.</p>\n<p>Derek tip-toes through the front door, his fingers crossed that he can get up to his room before anyone can <em>sense</em> what he\u2019s been up to.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just his luck, though, because Laura is sitting on the couch in the living room, and her eyes light up as soon as she sees him. Shit, he had no idea she was even coming home this weekend.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a fucking word,\u201d he warns, but she just grins wider.</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage, Derek!\u201d his mom calls out from somewhere at the back of the house, and Derek rolls his eyes. Being a werewolf really sucks sometimes.</p>\n<p>Laura smirks at him, with that look in her eye that means Derek is <em>not</em> going to like what comes out of her mouth. \u201cOn the full moon, really?\u201d she asks, her voice below a whisper. \u201cHow many hickies does that poor kid have now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares at her and then pounces, flipping her off the couch and onto the floor, narrowly avoiding the coffee table. She\u2019s still stronger than him, infuriatingly, but he\u2019s catching up and can get the upper hand if he surprises her. They scuffle for a minute, and before long she has him pinned and is sitting on his stomach.</p>\n<p>Laura grins triumphantly down at him, and he rolls his eyes. \u201cStiles is fine,\u201d he mutters, and she snorts as she slides off him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dare you to go sit in the backseat of the Camaro,\u201d he shoots back, and she pretends to gag, wrinkling her nose.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Gross</em>. And way to be trashy, seriously. The backseat?\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins. \u201cNot my idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, get away from me, you are so cocky.\u201d He can\u2019t pass up the obvious joke, but Laura claps her hand over his mouth before he gets the chance and tackles him again. They smash into the end table, the lamp wobbling treacherously, and they both freeze.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo claws in the house!\u201d It\u2019s his mom\u2019s voice again, and she pokes her head into the room with a frown. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to replace another picture frame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d they mutter in unison, edging apart from one another.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yes, Derek,\u201d she adds, her nose wrinkling delicately. \u201cPlease go take a shower before dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>With Laura cackling, Derek flushes all the way up to his hairline and trudges up the stairs.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Okay, remind me of the names again.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>Stiles.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>I made a cheat sheet.

Derek\u2019s parents are hosting some kind of big family cookout at their house, and Stiles is officially invited. There are a bunch of aunts and uncles and cousins who all live nearby, and while they\u2019re all apparently really close, Stiles hasn\u2019t yet met anyone outside of Derek\u2019s immediate family.</p>\n<p>At least his hickey has faded by now\u2014thank <em>fuck</em>, Stiles wasn\u2019t looking forward to explaining that. His dad\u2019s knowing looks were bad enough, he really didn\u2019t want to deal with however Derek\u2019s family would react. Derek says that they\u2019re all normal, nice people, but Stiles is still more than a little nervous. No matter what Derek says, he knows that first impressions aren\u2019t always his forte.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of cars all parked along the Hales\u2019 long driveway, and Stiles has to park about 30 yards down. He trips a little when he gets out, but Derek is suddenly <em>there</em>, up in his space and kissing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Stiles breathes back. Derek looks good, as always, in just jeans and a t-shirt, and Stiles is glad that he didn\u2019t decide to dress up any further.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He says it with more bravado than he feels, especially since he\u2019s all of a sudden weirdly dizzy.</p>\n<p>Derek leads him around the side of the house toward the backyard, but with each step Stiles feels worse and worse. Finally he has to stagger to a stop, bending over with his hands on his knees. All this energy is thrumming through him, it feels like, and he slams his eyes shut in a vain attempt to mitigate the spinning and the vibrating.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles? Stiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s voice sounds like it\u2019s coming from far away, but Stiles finally manages to open his eyes and focus on him. Derek\u2019s in front of him, his brow furrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sucks in a breath and then immediately regrets it. The smell of meat cooking hangs heavy in the air, making him queasy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He takes a small breath through his mouth, which is only slightly more palatable. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t seem convinced. \u201cYou really don\u2019t look fine. Do you want me to drive you home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. This is embarrassing enough already, he can see everyone clustered in the backyard staring at him, and he doesn\u2019t need to leave before he even meets anyone. \u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to straighten up away from Derek and take a step, but he crumples almost immediately. Derek has crazy reflexes, though, and manages to catch Stiles before he even gets near the ground. \u201cNope,\u201d Derek says, his voice tight. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re going inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, god, everyone is still staring\u2014this is <em>so</em> embarrassing. Derek should have listened to him about first impressions.</p>\n<p>Derek crouches a little and moves like he\u2019s going to hook his arm under Stiles\u2019 knees, but Stiles flinches away. \u201cI am <em>not</em> letting you carry me out of here, absolutely not,\u201d he says lowly. \u201cJust\u2014just keep your arm around me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs but obeys, his grip tight as he steers them toward the side door of the house. It\u2019s slow-going but they make it up to Derek\u2019s bedroom, and Stiles collapses gratefully into his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you feeling? What can I get for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just\u2026just really overwhelming for some reason?\u201d Stiles tries for a weak laugh as he rubs at the back of his neck. He\u2019s still not sure whether he\u2019s going to throw up or pass out. \u201cI have no idea, I\u2019ve never felt like this before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you having a panic attack?\u201d Derek asks seriously, and Stiles shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it, no. I\u2019m just\u2014like my <em>body</em> feels really overwhelmed. Which obviously doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns, but before he can say anything, the door to his bedroom opens. It\u2019s Derek\u2019s mom with a tall blond guy Stiles doesn\u2019t recognize, and Talia immediately moves to the bed, laying her hand on Stiles\u2019 arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Derek\u2019s Uncle Will, he\u2019s a nurse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really,\u201d Stiles protests, but Talia gives him the most mothering look he\u2019s seen in years, enough so that he has to close his eyes and swallow.</p>\n<p>Will steps forward and rests his hand against Stiles\u2019 forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re a little warm but not too bad. Have you been feeling bad recently?\u201d he asks, and Stiles shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNauseated? Double vision? Any other strange symptoms?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA little nauseated,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd dizzy. But that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will hums. \u201cYou might be a little dehydrated, it is unseasonably warm today. Or you might have the start of a virus. Just try to rest and drink some water, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek leaves with his mom and uncle and comes back a few minutes later with a tall glass of water. Stiles doesn\u2019t really feel like drinking anything, but he\u2019s not in the mood for Derek\u2019s disappointed face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should go back outside.\u201d Stiles can only manage about three sips and then rolls onto his side. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to miss out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. I see those losers all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s smiling as he climbs onto the bed, and Stiles moves closer to cuddle him shamelessly. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m getting sick? I could be contagious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not that worried about it,\u201d Derek says. He curls around him, pulling Stiles\u2019 head into the crook of his neck and hooking an arm around his waist. Derek always smells so comforting, and if Stiles can shut his eyes and think really hard, he can pretend that Derek\u2019s good energy is seeping into him and making him feel better.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for staying with me.\u201d He mumbles the words into the collar of Derek\u2019s shirt, but he seems to understand and starts to rub Stiles\u2019 back in a nonverbal <em>you\u2019re welcome</em>.</p>\n<p>Stiles never actually manages to doze off, he\u2019s pretty sure, but after an hour or so, he can at least contemplate the idea of standing without wanting to throw up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready to get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t move, though, and Derek\u2019s arm tightens. \u201cAre you sure? Don\u2019t worry about this party thing, we can stay here. Or I can take you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I want to meet everyone.\u201d It\u2019s a feat of strength, but Stiles manages to pry himself out of Derek\u2019s arms and sit up. \u201cAnd I might even be a little hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lifts up onto his elbows and opens his mouth, but Stiles glares at him and cuts him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say <em>are you sure</em> one more time, I\u2019m gonna be pissed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs and gets off the bed in that ridiculously graceful way of his. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s family politely doesn\u2019t mention the little fainting episode, except for Laura, who gives Stiles a big hug and then keeps her arm around him when he tries to step back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says gamely, trying for a smile. \u201cMust\u2019ve just been dehydrated or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, good.\u201d She shakes his shoulder a little and ruffles his hair. \u201cWe were worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles meets the rest of Derek\u2019s family\u2014Talia\u2019s brothers and Aaron\u2019s sisters and all the assorted children\u2014and while basically everyone is almost aggressively friendly, as a whole it\u2019s less intimidating than Stiles was anticipating. He feels better, physically, if he sticks close to Derek, which is clearly the placebo effect at work, but Stiles is gonna run with it. He even gets enough of an appetite to choke down half a hamburger and after a while feels safe enough to venture away from Derek.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a gorgeous garden plot at the far edge of the backyard, and Stiles wanders over in that direction, belatedly noticing that there\u2019s a kid sitting in the corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d He tries to make his voice sound cheerful and friendly, and the kid looks up at him. He\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s Robbie, Derek\u2019s Uncle Peter\u2019s son.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatcha doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTakin\u2019 care of the flowers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re doing a really good job. Can I help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Robbie stares up at him for a full second, then nods. \u201cOkay. The weeds look like this,\u201d he says, pointing. \u201cDon\u2019t pull the pretty ones, those are the flowers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Stiles says seriously.</p>\n<p>Robbie is a pretty quiet kid, it seems like, but soon enough Stiles gets him babbling about the flowers and the vegetables and the bugs that they find.</p>\n<p>After a while, something bumps up against his back, and he jumps. It\u2019s Derek, and he smiles at him when Stiles tips his head back to look up at him. \u201cIs Robbie putting you to work?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s a real taskmaster. You wanna help pull weeds?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll help you earn your dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>As soon as Derek walks into the kitchen in the morning, Robbie and Maggie latch onto him. He heaves each of them up into one arm with a huff\u2014man, they\u2019re getting heavy. \u201cWhat are you squirts doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going for a walk! To see the trees!\u201d Maggie says excitedly, but that doesn\u2019t exactly answer his question.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter and Beth had to go into the city for a doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d his dad says from the stove. He has eggs in one skillet and bacon in the other, and Derek\u2019s stomach rumbles.</p>\n<p>Laura\u2019s curled up on a stool at the breakfast bar, with a mug of coffee practically fused to her face. \u201cWe\u2019ve been drafted into babysitting duty,\u201d she says sleepily.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to go for a walk with Cora instead?\u201d Derek asks the twins, smiling encouragingly. He loves them, but he was planning to get some homework done this morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cCora\u2019s busy,\u201d his dad says, \u201chelping your mom in the garden. There\u2019s a lot of stuff to pick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. They definitely had a special dinner last month to celebrate the end of the harvest. \u201cI thought most everything was done,\u201d he says, and his dad shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo did we. Global warming, I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Can you wash the fruit in the fridge?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and dumps the twins onto the breakfast bar next to Laura.</p>\n<p>After they eat\u2014and after Laura has been properly caffeinated to deal with two six-year-olds\u2014they get ready to go outside. At the last minute, Derek grabs the beanie that Stiles gave him just the other day.</p>\n<p>Laura\u2019s by the back door downstairs, and she smiles at the sight of him. \u201cIt\u2019s like 60 degrees outside, Der.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Derek rolls his eyes at her and tugs the hat down lower over his forehead. \u201cStiles made it for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek can see the exact moment in Laura\u2019s eyes as she considers making fun of him, then changes her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice, it matches your eyes.\u201d She pats the top of his head, running her fingers over the yarn. \u201cI\u2019ll have to see if he\u2019ll make me one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said everyone can expect them as Christmas gifts, he knits a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome. Tell him I like purple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him yourself,\u201d Derek shoots back. \u201cI know you guys text.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura grins. \u201cAw, are you jealous? I don\u2019t tell embarrassing stories about you or anything. Not that often, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes and shoves her, a little too hard, on their way outside. Maggie and Robbie come running toward them, trailed by Cora, who\u2019s got two baskets full of zucchini and summer squash. Derek grimaces at the sight\u2014by this time of year, he\u2019s really tired of zucchini.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Maggie takes his hand and tugs him toward the tree line. \u201cCan we go? Is that your camera?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, and yes. Do you wanna hold it? Remember to be careful, don\u2019t drop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most of the kids like playing with Derek\u2019s camera, and he loves seeing what pictures they come up with. Usually for every shot that cuts off someone\u2019s head or has a thumb over the lens, there\u2019s an accidentally-creative one that he likes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all fun and games on their walk until Maggie trips and falls into a thorny bush just off the trail. With a wince, Derek hands the camera to Laura and reaches down to pick her up. Unsurprisingly, she\u2019s immediately started wailing\u2014werewolves heal quickly, but injuries still hurt, especially to a six-year-old. He swings her up onto his hip and starts blotting away the blood on her leg with the hem of his t-shirt, while his other hand tries to take some of her pain. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, kiddo, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Laura says sharply, and he jerks his head up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, over the sound of Maggie\u2019s tears. He pats her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you bleeding?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks down at his bare arm and frowns. His arm scraped right through that thorny bush when he bent to grab Maggie, but now there\u2019s not even a scratch. He shouldn\u2019t heal <em>that</em> quickly.</p>\n<p>He shifts Maggie to his other hip and reaches down into the bush again, dragging his arm deliberately against the thorns. He braces for the stinging pain, but there\u2019s nothing\u2014just a slight tickle even as he watches the thorns scrape against his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he whispers, looking up. Laura\u2019s eyes are wide. She promptly sticks her arm into the bush, too, but pulls it out quickly, cursing under her breath as she wipes the blood off onto her jeans.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should to tell Mom. That\u2019s really weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Derek stares at his arm, then the bush, then back at his arm. He shakes his head and jostles Maggie. \u201cYou want to go back or walk some more?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWalk more,\u201d she says, wiggling until Derek lets her back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnward!\u201d Laura yells, pointing farther down the trail, and Robbie runs ahead of her. Derek looks at the bush one more time and follows.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re back in the house, Derek takes off his beanie and scrubs a hand through his hair while he scrapes his boots clean. Uncle Peter\u2019s sitting with his parents in the kitchen, and Maggie makes a beeline for him. \u201cDaddy, the bush hurt my leg.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter swings her up into his lap. \u201cWhere, sweetie?\u201d Maggie points to her shin, and Peter kisses it.</p>\n<p>Laura helps Robbie reach to wash his hands. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on with those bushes. You know, the ones with the thorns? They didn\u2019t make Derek bleed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d their mom asks, frowning. \u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d She steps toward the counter and brandishes a knife from the block. \u201cCome here, Derek, let\u2019s test it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur family is strange,\u201d Peter remarks, and his mom sticks her tongue out at him as Derek obediently steps forward.</p>\n<p>She lays the blade against the skin of his forearm and draws it down gently, but a thin line of blood appears almost immediately. They all stare at it for a second, then she runs a dishrag underneath the tap and cleans Derek\u2019s arm. He doesn\u2019t exactly need it, but she takes his pain away as they both watch it heal.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it was something special about the bush?\u201d he offers, and Laura frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it cut my arm. And Maggie\u2019s leg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d his mom says, her brow furrowed. \u201cInteresting. Tell me if something like that happens again. Or anything else weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The small wound has healed, and Derek slides his sleeve down self-consciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are your plans for the rest of the day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing over to Stiles\u2019. We have physics to work on.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Physics</em>, Laura mouths behind their mom\u2019s back, winking, and Derek rolls his eyes at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2026where\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face\u2014nothing worse than thinking about <em>parents</em> while he\u2019s got a hand down Derek\u2019s pants\u2014and bites his neck in retaliation before responding. \u201cNot home for at least another hour. Shut up and take off your pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs but obediently reaches one hand down to unbutton his jeans. \u201cYou wanna\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek uses his body weight to shift them toward the bed, but Stiles pushes right back so that Derek\u2019s flat against his closed bedroom door.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no no no,\u201d he breathes. \u201cRight here? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just kisses him, which is answer enough, and Stiles immediately deepens it. It\u2019s frantic, heated, and Stiles has to pull back to catch his breath. He multitasks, because he\u2019s productive like that, and moves down to press a line of biting kisses down Derek\u2019s neck. He must have the toughest skin known to man because the hickeys never last, no matter how hard Stiles tries.</p>\n<p>He slides his hand back into Derek\u2019s pants, easier with them unbuttoned, curling carefully around his dick. Stiles knows how Derek likes it now, knowledge that he very much enjoyed gathering, and he doesn\u2019t hold back. Derek has a little bit of a hair trigger sometimes, which Stiles finds secretly hilarious and not-so-secretly very flattering, and sure enough, a few minutes later, he\u2019s curving into Stiles\u2019 body with a grunt.</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs out a breathless laugh and wipes his hand on his shirt. Derek\u2019s out of breath, his head tipped back against the door with his eyes closed, and it\u2019s a really fucking good look on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, you look good like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts and scrubs both hands through his hair before leaning forward for a firm kiss. \u201cWith my pants around my thighs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and with your shirt still on. Very\u2026debauched.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll show <em>you</em> debauched,\u201d he mumbles, not bothering to fix his pants before he shoves Stiles backward.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, good one,\u201d he snarks, but Derek gets the last word when he pushes Stiles to sit on the bed and drops to his knees in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are your pants still on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic question,\u201d Stiles says, breathless as he tips onto his back and fumbles with his zipper. He manages it, with Derek\u2019s help, and he lets out a strained noise as Derek takes hold of his dick through his boxers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always good, obviously, whenever they do this, but it\u2019s never been quite like this before, with Stiles feeling like he\u2019s burning up from the inside out. He tries to breathe through it, but he\u2019s practically <em>vibrating </em>with energy, energy that he needs to shake it off somehow. He\u2019s squirming on the bed and sliding his hands all over Derek, tangling in his hair and thumbing over his cheeks before sliding down over his shoulders.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Derek pulls back, lunging over toward Stiles\u2019 nightstand and grabbing the water glass he left there. Stiles blinks, still drunk with lust, and watches dumbly as Derek upends the glass over a stack of papers on the corner of Stiles\u2019 desk that\u2019s\u2026<em>smoking</em>?</p>\n<p>Stiles scrambles up to a seated position. \u201cHoly fuck, was that on <em>fire</em>?\u201d he says, his voice squeaking. \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. He\u2019s panting a little, and he wipes his mouth on the shoulder of his shirt. \u201cWhat the hell. You don\u2019t have candles, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Stiles scrubs a hand over his face. He\u2019s still jittery, but less so now. Probably because Derek isn\u2019t touching his dick anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s sunny, and the shades are open. Maybe the sunlight reflecting or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns and tilts his head, considering the window. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrifying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope these weren\u2019t important.\u201d Derek gingerly flips through the stack of papers, now singed at the edges, and Stiles winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, not really. Nothing I can\u2019t just print again, anyway.\u201d Stiles leans back on one arm and pulls his seductive face, which he knows is not particularly alluring. Derek still has sex with him, though, so it must not be <em>that</em> bad. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek quirks an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not concerned about the spontaneous fire in your bedroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I am, very much so. So please help me relax by making me come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes with a little huff, but he\u2019s smiling as he steps closer and drops back down onto his knees.</p>\n<p>Derek rummages through the pantry for another bag of chips, humming himself as he does so. They\u2019re having another customary Hale pack cookout, and with Stiles there, easily charming everyone, Derek doesn\u2019t think he could be any happier. He hasn\u2019t yet broached the topic with his parents\u2014he\u2019s still working up the courage\u2014but he thinks that soon, he might be able to tell Stiles the big family secret. He\u2019s quite possibly foolishly optimistic, but Stiles certainly seems open-minded enough to accept it.</p>\n<p>A sudden cracking, rumbling noise makes him frown. It sounded like thunder, but as of two minutes ago, it was sunny and cloudless outside.</p>\n<p>Derek steps out of the pantry into the kitchen, and sure enough, there\u2019s the unmistakable clatter of windy rain against the windows. He peers out the back door and grimaces at the frantic scene, all the kids screaming and everyone scrambling to get the food inside. He looks around for Stiles, like always, and all the blood rushes out of his face when he spots him.</p>\n<p>Stiles is standing in the middle of the backyard, eyes glazed over as he sways, as if he\u2019s in some kind of weird trance. \u201cStiles!\u201d Derek yells, running toward him.</p>\n<p>The rain is getting harder, thunder interspersed with strong gusts of wind, and a few seconds later, Stiles\u2019 eyes fall shut as he collapses. Derek lunges forward and manages to catch him before he hits the ground.</p>\n<p>Before he can even contemplate what the <em>fuck</em> is happening right now, his mom and Peter are surrounding them. She swipes impatiently at her wet hair and leans over Stiles with a worried look on her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich way was he facing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d She gives him a no-nonsense, alpha look. \u201cThat way,\u201d Derek says, nodding northwest toward the trees, and she nods sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cHumans and everyone under 16, into the house,\u201d she yells, her voice carrying even over the rain. \u201cDerek, you too, take Stiles. Everyone else with me, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom,\u201d he says, trying to get her attention as she whispers furiously with Peter. He may be 18, but his boyfriend is slumped unconscious in his arms and he really just needs his mom to tell him that everything\u2019s going to be okay. She turns to him and touches Stiles\u2019 shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you recognize that scent?\u201d she asks, her voice quiet, and Derek closes his eyes, concentrating as he tries to sift through the food and the rain and the panic coursing through everyone else. Finally, he catches onto the hint of ozone and almost physically recoils.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, it smells like Bernadette,\u201d he says, with a violent exhale, and she nods grimly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCall Deaton, ask him to come over as soon as he can. He\u2019ll know what it\u2019s about. And also call the Sheriff. <em>Tell him</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek winces. \u201cMom, I don\u2019t know if I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d she interrupts, curving one hand around his cheek like she\u2019s done ever since he was a little kid who was scared of the monsters under his bed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon. Take Stiles inside and make him comfortable, okay? He\u2019ll be fine, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, the adults run off, into the trees, and Derek is left standing in the middle of the backyard, soaking wet with rain streaming down his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone yells his name from the back door of the house, and he snaps back into motion. Stiles is still\u2026unconscious or asleep or whatever he is, and Derek carries him carefully back into the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should get him out of those wet clothes,\u201d Will says. \u201cCora?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some of Derek\u2019s!\u201d she calls out, already halfway up the stairs.</p>\n<p>Will guides Derek toward the couch, which is already set up with a couple of extra blankets. He sets Stiles down carefully, grimacing as his head lolls off the pillow.</p>\n<p>After Derek and Will make quick work of changing his clothes, Will picks up Stiles\u2019 wrist to take his pulse, then looks briefly into his eyes. \u201cHeart rate\u2019s good. He should be fine, he just needs rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sits next to Stiles\u2019 hip on the couch, staring at the gentle rise and fall of his chest to convince himself that he\u2019s still breathing. \u201cNow what?\u201d he asks, and his dad squeezes his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now we wait for him to wake up. I\u2019ll keep watch, you go get changed into dry clothes and get something to eat.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t budge, still staring at Stiles\u2019 chest, and his dad gives him a gentle nudge in the shoulder. \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s his no-nonsense voice, so Derek peels himself off the couch. He methodically changes clothes, dropping his sodden ones in the laundry basket and toweling his hair dry.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still raining outside, he notices, as he trots back downstairs.</p>\n<p>Aunt Beth, Peter\u2019s wife, is in the kitchen wrapping up the food, and Derek frowns. She\u2019s not only a werewolf but is one of the pack\u2019s best fighters. Derek has no idea what\u2019s going on, but regardless of the situation, she isn\u2019t someone that they would leave behind. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out there with them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to know a secret?\u201d she whispers, and when Derek nods, she rests her hand low on her stomach with a conspiratorial smile.</p>\n<p>It takes Derek a second, then his eyebrows shoot up. \u201cWow, really? Congratulations!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. You can probably hear the heartbeat if you try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek crouches in front of her, turning his head, and when he concentrates, he can hear a thready, quick <em>lub-dub</em>. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill asleep,\u201d he says with a sigh as he stands, and her smile is sympathetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d <em>How is everyone so sure</em>, Derek wants to ask, but doesn\u2019t. \u201cDo you want something to eat?\u201d she asks, and Derek makes a face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, too bad,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cLet me make you a sandwich, it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>After what feels like hours but is probably only about 90 minutes, the adult werewolves finally come tromping in through the back door.</p>\n<p>Cora runs over first and gives their mom a hug. \u201cAre you guys okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, we\u2019re fine. How\u2019s Stiles? Any word from Alan or John?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s still out,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cBut Uncle Will says he\u2019s fine otherwise. And Deaton and the Sheriff both said they could be here in about an hour. What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe went over to the northwest edge of the territory.\u201d His mom sighs and picks at the bowl of crackers on the kitchen island. \u201cSomeone messed with the protective runes, pretty badly. Hopefully it was just an omega and not anyone actually testing our borders.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet for a second, as everyone contemplates the repercussions of what that could possibly mean.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come none of you felt the disturbance?\u201d his dad asks.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s not totally sure how the magic of the pack works, but the runes are supposed to be constructed so that when they\u2019re disturbed, it somehow alerts the senior, more powerful members of the pack\u2014Talia, Peter, and Laura, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause the runes are incomplete\u2014since we don\u2019t have an emissary, no one has been keeping up with them in a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet again, until Cora is the one who finally acknowledges the elephant in the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em>Stiles</em> felt it?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom sighs again, smoothing down a nonexistent wrinkle in her shirt. \u201cIt appears so, yes. We should wait for Alan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says sharply, and she looks up at him in surprise. \u201cI think you all know something that you\u2019re not telling me, and I want to know what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>His parents exchange a look, and his dad shrugs. His mom lifts her eyebrows, and from the magic of an alpha glance, everyone else scatters.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re all gone, she steps closer to Derek and lays a hand on his arm. \u201cI think Stiles might be a spark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know that much about sparks, but he knows that they\u2019re <em>magic</em>. And Stiles\u2014Stiles is human. Right?</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know much,\u201d she admits. \u201cMy knowledge of sparks is\u2026limited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how long have you been thinking this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that long. A couple weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>A couple of <em>weeks</em>.</p>\n<p>Derek clenches his jaw. \u201cAnd why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Why hasn\u2019t <em>he</em> noticed anything, he means.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe scent I mentioned to you earlier, I had gotten whiffs of that before. And then there was the garden.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cWhat about the garden?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first time he came over to the house, remember, he and Robbie worked in the garden? And then a week later, we had that surprise, bountiful harvest. Sparks can have amplifying nature effects.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods, slowly. \u201cAnd you just\u2026decided not to tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d his mom says, her alpha voice in full effect. \u201cYou are a beta in my pack, and more importantly, you are my <em>son</em>. I am always, always going to do everything I can to protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek crosses his arms tightly over his chest. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think that <em>telling me</em> would be a better way of protecting me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure! And especially after\u2026after\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s uncharacteristic for his mom to stumble over her words, and Derek\u2019s entire body tenses. \u201c<em>Kate</em>,\u201d he spits. \u201cYou can say her name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes close for a second before she opens them again, and her voice is softer now. \u201cAfter Kate. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was actually my intuition, or if I was just paranoid. And you\u2026you seemed so happy, sweetie. I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t want to make you worry until I was sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek is suddenly too tired to keep standing, and he slides down the wall until he\u2019s sitting down, his legs tucked up against his body. His mom follows him and leans her head against his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really think he\u2019s a spark?\u201d he whispers, and she nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably. Or something, at least. Especially after this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do you think\u2026is he a danger to our pack? Was that what this whole thing was about? I mean, he\u2014\u201d Derek pauses to swallow. God, how did he miss all the signs? \u201cHe did just come right up to me on the first day of school.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pokes at his cheek with a little smile. \u201cThat might have been because of something else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek groans and tucks his face into his knees. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo am I. I\u2019ve been digging into his family\u2019s background, and I don\u2019t see any reason that he would want to hurt us.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>There\u2019s no real </em>reason <em>hurt us at all, </em>Derek thinks bitterly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why wouldn\u2019t he tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom shrugs. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell him that you\u2019re a werewolf?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d he mutters, and she squeezes his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know more until Deaton and John get here and Stiles wakes up. Let\u2019s go wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is in that weird sleep stage where he\u2019s awake, kind of, but there\u2019s no way in hell he can pry his eyes open, no matter how hard he tries. His whole body feels heavy, like he\u2019s just half a second from falling asleep again, but he fights against it, trying to get closer to the surface.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s waking up,\u201d someone whispers, and Stiles tries to concentrate enough to identify the voice. Derek\u2019s dad, maybe? A lot of people are talking, but they\u2019re doing it softly enough that it\u2019s all blurring together.</p>\n<p>Then someone\u2019s hand is on his arm, their thumb brushing gently against the inside of his elbow, and Stiles is pretty sure it\u2019s Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou awake, kiddo?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s <em>his</em> dad, definitely. Stiles tries to offer a <em>yes</em>, but it comes out as more of a croak. He redoubles his efforts to open his eyes and finally manages it.</p>\n<p>After blinking about 18 times, he can recognize that he\u2019s in the Hales\u2019 living room, on the couch, and there are a lot of worried faces around him. His dad and Derek are closest, followed by Derek\u2019s parents, but he can see others, like Peter and Laura and Cora, hovering at the edges of his vision.</p>\n<p>Someone offers him a glass of water, which he drains in two gulps\u2014it\u2019s ice-cold, and it does a lot to finish waking him up. He hands it off to someone, he has no idea who, and tries to sit up. Derek\u2019s hand stops him, though, and gently presses him back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Stiles asks, and everyone exchanges glances. Anxiety builds in the pit of his stomach, but his dad\u2019s face is calm when he faces him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot we need to talk about. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to rest a little bit longer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says impatiently, and this time when he tries to sit up a little, no one stops him. \u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout six hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Talia asks, and her eyes are serious enough that Stiles takes a second to really think about it. Did something happen to him that he doesn\u2019t remember?</p>\n<p>\u201cStill really tired. And a little bit dizzy. But otherwise okay, I think.\u201d He feels Derek intertwine their fingers, and Stiles squeezes hard. \u201cSomeone please tell me what the hell is going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad sighs and pats his leg. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s kind of a lot, kiddo, okay? But I promise that you\u2019re fine, everything is fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re just scaring me,\u201d Stiles says, his voice smaller than he\u2019d like, and his dad\u2019s face tightens.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, sweetie,\u201d Talia starts. \u201cThis is not exactly how we wanted to tell you, but we\u2019re werewolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Werewolves.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows. This is absolutely, most definitely a dream. \u201cWhat? Dad, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>He squeezes his leg again. \u201cI know how it sounds. Let Talia explain everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWerewolves,\u201d Stiles repeats, and it sounds no less ridiculous in his own voice. \u201cAll of you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is sharp, he can tell, but Talia doesn\u2019t flinch. \u201cMe, Peter, Beth, Laura, Derek, Cora. And others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 breath hitches. He glances at Derek, who\u2019s very studiously looking at the floor. His boyfriend is a <em>werewolf</em>? What kind of <em>Twilight</em>-level sorcery is this? He tries to pull his hand away, but Derek holds fast, even though he still won\u2019t meet Stiles\u2019 eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cProve it,\u201d he says harshly, and for some reason, that makes everyone smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek said you\u2019d say that,\u201d his dad explains, and Stiles isn\u2019t sure how he feels about that.</p>\n<p>Talia puts some more space between them\u2014Stiles isn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019s grateful for or resentful of the gesture\u2014and half a second later, he\u2019s staring at\u2026at some different kind of creature. And then it\u2019s gone, and regular Talia is sitting in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he breathes. His knowledge of werewolf mythology is sorely lacking, and his fingers are itching to get to his computer. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026wow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 mind is full to the brim of questions, popping up one after another almost faster than he can consciously realize them, and he tries to sift through them for the most important ones. \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d he asks his dad, who nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs of a couple hours ago, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay. Well, he trusts his dad, at least. He turns to Talia again, who seems to be in charge. \u201cSo how is this related to me, like, passing out or whatever? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighs and gestures behind Stiles. \u201cThat is a question for Alan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone sits down next to her, and Stiles gapes at him. \u201cDr. <em>Deaton</em>? Why is the vet here? Are you a werewolf?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m a druid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is a druid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026I help maintain balance, shall we say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face. \u201cThe balance of <em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia shoots Deaton a glare and takes a seat next to Stiles\u2019 hip. \u201cAlan is an advisor. He\u2019s very well-versed in many supernatural matters, especially magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMagic,\u201d he repeats, and she nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cWerewolves are only one of the creatures that inhabit the supernatural world. Magic threads through all of us, of course, and are more concentrated in specific creatures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026like witches and stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking, yes,\u201d Deaton says. \u201cWhich includes you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at him for a long second, wondering if this is the point where he\u2019s going to wake up. \u201cMe. Magic. You think I\u2019m <em>magic</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a way <em>how</em>?\u201d he asks, his teeth clenched, but Deaton just studies him with that inscrutable gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy all appearances, you seem to have a spark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA spark,\u201d he repeats, and Deaton nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. People with sparks are\u2026particularly <em>receptive</em> to magic and to other supernatural creatures. Conduits, if you will, which are always looking for something to amplify their power.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m magic,\u201d he says again. Derek is still holding his hand, and he squeezes. This is insane, he\u2019s not <em>magic</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomewhat, yes. Once you started spending time with Derek, and by consequence the Hale pack, your spark sensed safety and opportunity, and so it started to manifest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>sentient</em>?\u201d he asks, his eyes wide, and Deaton\u2019s face becomes, somehow, even more inscrutable.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say <em>in a matter of speaking</em> one more time,\u201d he says, glaring at him, and Talia lets out a short burst of laughter. Deaton just frowns at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe spark sensed a potential emissary match, yes,\u201d he says, and then it\u2019s Stiles\u2019 turn to frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an emissary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEach werewolf pack has an emissary. They are responsible for maintaining the balance between other packs and protecting the territory, mostly through magic. The emissary is only as strong as their pack, and vice versa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s your emissary?\u201d he asks Talia, whose eyes droop as the mood in the room shifts. No one will meet Stiles\u2019 eyes, including Derek, and Stiles frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur emissary died last year,\u201d Talia says softly. \u201cShe was close to 90.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd as a consequence,\u201d Deaton chimes in, \u201cthe Hale pack is overall quite weak. They\u2019ve been able to persevere thus far because their lineage is very strong. But the word is starting to get out that they\u2019ve been substantially weakened, and that could bring a lot of trouble to Beacon Hills.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, trying to absorb everything. \u201cSo my\u2026my <em>spark</em> sensed a good match and started to manifest because it wants\u2014it wants me to be the Hale pack emissary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Deaton says simply. Stiles swallows and withdraws his hand from Derek\u2019s, who lets him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know this?\u201d he asks Talia, and she hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I had a little bit of an inkling, a couple weeks ago. We thought you might have known about your spark and were hiding it from us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t!\u201d he exclaims, and Talia squeezes his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know, sweetie, we know that now. And we would have found some way to tell you, but I wasn\u2019t sure until today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, slowly. \u201cWhat was that, anyway? What happened today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia sighs. \u201cThere was a small disturbance at one of the borders of our territory. Your spark sensed it, apparently, and tried to defend us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can admit that sounds pretty badass. \u201cAnd the passing out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour body is not at all accustomed to using magic,\u201d Deaton says, \u201cnor does it know how to ration it. Exhaustion is very common in beginners.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is still half-convinced that he\u2019s about to wake up from some kind of crazy fever dream, but he nods. \u201cSo\u2026what\u2019s next, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf\u2014and I remind you that this is still an <em>if</em>\u2014Mr. Stilinski is in fact to become your emissary, he will need immediate training to strengthen his spark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wrinkles his nose. \u201cI thought, like, my <em>spark</em> already decided it,\u201d he says, and Deaton shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that cut and dry, nor is it so predetermined. Your spark manifested because it sensed a potential emissary match. It still needs to be strengthened, for one. Then, both you <em>and</em> the Hale pack need to initiate and accept the bond.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows. \u201cSo I could just\u2026walk away.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a stirring behind him and some hushed voices, but Deaton just looks at him steadily. \u201cYes. If you cut off contact with the Hale pack, your spark will slowly recede. It will do you no harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about <em>us</em>?\u201d Cora cries out. \u201cWe\u2019re weak and we need an emissary!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCora,\u201d Talia says sharply. \u201cHush.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora frowns but ducks her chin and obeys. Stiles frowns. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t have to decide right this second, do I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia\u2019s \u201cof course not\u201d overlaps neatly with his dad\u2019s \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek has been silent this whole time, looking down at the blanket covering Stiles\u2019 lap, and Stiles slips their fingers together again. Derek squeezes gratefully.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to ask this, especially in front of all these people, but the words slip out before he can stop them. \u201cDoes, uh, does this have anything to do with me and Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton shakes his head. \u201cThe spark can sense a potential beneficial relationship, but it has nothing to do with romance. The same thing would have happened with your spark if you came into prolonged contact with Laura, for example, but presumably, there would have been no romance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank fuck,\u201d Laura mutters under her breath, and Derek glares at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure, though?\u201d Stiles asks. Derek is seriously cool, in like every conceivable way, and it would make total sense if <em>magic </em>explained why he was actually into Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t that powerful,\u201d Deaton says flatly, and Stiles winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez. Harsh. I mean, I know he\u2019s out of my league, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a love spell,\u201d he interrupts to say. \u201cYour spark in no way compelled Derek to be in a relationship with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, stop talking,\u201d Derek cuts in. \u201cIt's fine, I promise. We'll talk about it later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia is smiling, but Laura is downright cackling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm sorry I was concerned about <em>magically assaulting</em> you!\u201d Stiles says stridently. Derek rolls his eyes and folds his free arm across his chest.</p>\n<p>Deaton seems completely disinterested in their banter. \u201cHave you noticed your magic manifesting in other ways recently?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cNo. I had no idea I <em>was</em> magic, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>But Derek shakes his head. \u201cYou almost passed out before, the first time you came over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles totally forgot about that. Wow, he has a really terrible track record of staying conscious around Derek\u2019s family.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was probably the shock to your spark of encountering so many pack members at the same time, I assume,\u201d Talia says, turning to Deaton, and he nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, and the fire!\u201d Stiles yelps, and Derek grimaces.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened with fire?\u201d Deaton leans forward, his eyebrows furrowing. \u201cWorking with fire is an advanced form of magic and results only from very intense emotion or intensive training.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 cheeks feel hot. \u201cUh, I\u2019d really rather not tell that story with all these adults around.\u201d His dad crosses his arms over his chest, quirking an eyebrow, and Stiles pales. \u201cNothing illegal, I swear! Just sex!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek closes his eyes, while Laura looks like she\u2019s holding in her laughter by sheer force of will. \u201cSo you had sex and started a fire? That didn\u2019t seem suspicious?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really asking for more details?\u201d he shoots back, and she makes a face.</p>\n<p>\u201cPoint.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton sits back in his chair, and Stiles gets the impression that he\u2019s reached the limit of what he\u2019s going to tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I, um\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to go upstairs?\u201d Derek interrupts, and Stiles shoots him a grateful look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stands up under his own power, avoiding Derek\u2019s steadying hand, and hugs his dad.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk with these guys for a while, okay?\u201d he says. \u201cWe can go home in a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Love you, pops.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he says. He looks proud, weirdly so considering that all Stiles has done is apparently become some kind of <em>magician</em>, but he\u2019ll take it.</p>\n<p>The stairs are a bit slow-going, though he continues to resist Derek\u2019s help. His bed looks <em>so</em> good, though, and Stiles collapses down onto it with a happy groan.</p>\n<p>When he forces his eyes open again, Derek\u2019s hovering by the door, his shoulders a bit hunched, and Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cGet over here, I\u2019m not scared of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Derek moves, though, and joins Stiles on the bed. Stiles inches closer, shamelessly, and Derek wraps an arm around him. \u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cNo, not really. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s an easy thing to tell people,\u201d he says, and Derek shakes his head. He buries his nose in Stiles\u2019 neck and takes an exaggerated sniff.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs and cards a hand through Derek\u2019s hair. \u201cWhy do I smell good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing my clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks down, notices that he is in fact wearing a hoodie and a pair of sweatpants that are a little big on him. \u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re telling me that a super-sniffer is part of being a werewolf? That makes sense, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnhanced senses, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks about that for a second, then looks at the door and cringes\u2014they\u2019ve definitely\u2026<em>done stuff</em> in here before. Derek follows his gaze, though, and shakes his head. \u201cSoundproof. All our rooms are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank god,\u201d he says, and Derek laughs. It gets quiet again, and Derek starts to trace lines with his finger on the skin above Stiles\u2019 waistband, his touch maddeningly soft. Stiles\u2019 dick is too tired to get interested, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to tell you,\u201d he says quietly, and Stiles freezes. \u201cThat conversation has\u2026not exactly gone well for me in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first girl I dated\u2026she just completely freaked out. Her family moved away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of an overreaction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill about 40 percent sure this isn\u2019t real, but otherwise I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m going to have a million questions, though, I\u2019m just too tired to think through all of them right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lets out a small laugh and resumes the movement of his hand, which is doing a great job of lulling Stiles to sleep. But after a minute, his hand stills and holds onto the hem of the hoodie instead. \u201cI have something else to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls onto his stomach muffles his yawn into the pillow. How the hell is he <em>still tired</em>? \u201cYeah? Good thing is, now that I know you\u2019re a werewolf, it\u2019s hard to shock me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs a little, but it\u2019s flat. He picks up Stiles\u2019 hand and threads their fingers together. \u201cYou know that we lived near San Diego for a couple years, for my dad\u2019s job. When we were there, I, uh\u2026I met someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says slowly, and Derek swallows, looking down.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was, um, older. And so I didn\u2019t tell my parents. But the whole thing\u2026\u201d Derek trails off and then shakes his head, sharp, as his face tightens. \u201cThe whole thing was fake. She was just using me. She and her dad tried to burn our house down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 jaw drops. \u201cHoly <em>shit</em>. What\u2014why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are hunters. People who try to hunt werewolves and other supernatural creatures.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows. \u201cFuck. But you guys\u2026I mean, you guys are fine, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls closer, until his head is mostly buried in Stiles\u2019 neck again. \u201cOur emissary died protecting us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, shit. No wonder Derek was shy about relationships.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it was my fault,\u201d Derek continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says quietly. He has zero details about the situation, of course, but he\u2019s certain of this, at least. \u201cI swear to you, Derek, it wasn\u2019t. The only person you\u2019re allowed to blame is that crazy girl. What happened to her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Kate. She\u2019s in jail, they both are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd is that why you guys moved back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cThere were\u2026the hunter activity is stronger down there. It\u2019s safer here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pulls back a bit, his arm still hooked over Stiles\u2019 waist. His eyes are red. \u201cDo you, uh, do you have any other questions?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Yes</em>, actually, but he\u2019s not sure he can handle any of them right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we just\u2026lay here for a minute?\u201d he asks instead, because he\u2019s seriously fucking exhausted, and Derek immediately rolls onto his back before tucking Stiles against his side. Stiles rests his ear right over Derek\u2019s heart and lets the steady thump lull him back to sleep.</p>\n<p>The door to the vet\u2019s office jingles as Derek steps in, and it\u2019s dark enough that he can barely make out Stiles slumped over a line of chairs in the waiting room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Deaton\u2019s behind the counter, flipping through paperwork, and Derek grits his teeth. Stiles has been training with him for two weeks now, but Derek still isn\u2019t a fan of his aggressive placidness.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d he says, ignoring Deaton, and Stiles jerks into wakefulness, wincing as he smacks his elbow on an armrest.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. Thanks for coming to pick me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stands and cracks his neck. \u201cBye, Deaton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Mr. Stilinski.\u201d He still doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cSee you on Thursday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pointedly does not say goodbye and ushers Stiles out the door. \u201cI\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cNah. I passed out about 15 minutes ago, so Deaton let me stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you doing today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs as he drops into the front seat of the Camaro. He props his feet on the dashboard, and Derek doesn\u2019t even bat them down. \u201cBoiling water. Who knew that was so <em>fucking </em>difficult. Apparently I have \u2018natural talent,\u2019 or whatever, according to him, but only when I\u2019m not trying. Doing magic on purpose is a lot harder. And I don\u2019t even get it. Why would I ever need to boil water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeaton probably wanted tea,\u201d Derek says dryly.</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs and yawns again. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve made <em>fire</em> before! And a thunderstorm!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did pass out for six hours when you made the thunderstorm,\u201d Derek points out, and Stiles huffs, crossing his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cDetails,\u201d he says, and Derek laughs.</p>\n<p>He dozes off again on the drive back to the Hales\u2019, then frowns at the Beacon County cruiser that Derek pulls in behind. \u201cThat\u2019s weird, why is my dad here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek unbuckles his seatbelt and moves to get out of the car, but Stiles grabs his elbow. \u201cWait one goddamn second, mister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins and tugs him forward. Derek grins back, bracing one elbow on the center console as he leans in for a kiss.</p>\n<p>Once they get inside, their parents are sitting in the living room. The talking stops as soon as Derek and Stiles step inside, and they both freeze.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asks immediately. \u201cYou all look freaked out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all fine, dear,\u201d Derek\u2019s mom says. \u201cCome sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>They do, cautiously, on the loveseat, and the three parents stare at them from the couch. Derek is feeling a little unnerved.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d his mom starts. \u201cFirst of all, we are so appreciative of all the hard work you\u2019ve been putting into this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes are a little narrowed. \u201cWhich is why I just spent two hours in the back of a vet\u2019s office, staring at cup of water and trying to get it to boil.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Derek asks, and his voice is sharp enough that his mom gives him a little look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, to put it simply, you two have a particular bond, of course, and we\u2014we aren\u2019t sure how that\u2019s going to influence this whole process.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you said our relationship didn\u2019t have anything to do with the development of Stiles\u2019 spark,\u201d Derek says, and his mom nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is correct. But we are <em>less</em> sure of how it will influence the bonding process between Stiles as an emissary and our pack. That development is very delicate and needs to be taken seriously and monitored. Both for the health of Stiles\u2019 magic, most importantly, and for the impact on our pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what are you saying, exactly?\u201d Stiles asks, and all of the parents exchange looks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe would like the two of you to, uh,\u201d John says, \u201cspend a little bit of time apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes widen, but before he can say anything, his mom speaks up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe agree that this isn\u2019t fair,\u201d she says, \u201cand we understand that this is difficult, I promise. But we wouldn\u2019t ask if it weren\u2019t important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you want us to break up,\u201d Derek says flatly, and his dad winces a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore of a\u2014more of a break, really, than a break-<em>up</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Semantics</em>, Derek thinks but doesn\u2019t say.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d Stiles asks, his voice small, and Derek presses their knees together.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would depend on how Stiles\u2019 spark progresses. Likely about a month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we talk about it?\u201d Derek asks, and they all nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d his mom says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two go up to your room. The Stilinskis are staying for dinner, and we\u2019ll be eating in about 20 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re silent on their way up the stairs, and Derek carefully closes the door behind them before he rubs at the back of his neck. \u201cYou can still say no, you know. To this whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Stiles says quickly. \u201cThis is important shit. I have a <em>spark</em>, Derek, and I can use it to help your family. That\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re amazing</em>, Derek wants to say. \u201cBut we have to <em>break up</em> now, that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Stiles sits down on the bed and leans his arms behind his body. \u201cI might have an idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek arches one eyebrow. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe definitely shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d Stiles gasps out against Derek\u2019s mouth. He tries to pull back, but Stiles\u2019 leg tightens where it hooked over Derek\u2019s thigh. \u201cOh, no, don\u2019t you go anywhere, I\u2019m really close.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiles into the kiss and moves down to nose at Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cIs that what does it for you then? Knowing that we shouldn\u2019t be doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chokes out a breathless laugh and arches up, pressing his chest more firmly against Derek\u2019s and tightening his hand, where he has a grip on both their dicks. \u201cOh, yeah. Forbidden sex with my hot werewolf boyfriend. I\u2019m basically living in a teen novel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Twilight about vampires?\u201d Derek bites at Stiles\u2019 neck and smiles again when he laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t talk about Twilight, I\u2019ll lose my erection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Derek kisses Stiles before he can respond and adds his hand to the effort. It doesn\u2019t take long after that, and Derek relishes Stiles\u2019 shuddering groan in his ear. He follows soon after and lets his forehead rest against Stiles\u2019 shoulder while Stiles runs a shaky hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are so good at pretending to be broken up,\u201d he whispers, and Derek laughs.</p>\n<p>Derek showers at Stiles\u2019, thoroughly, and changes into a fresh pair of clothes that he brought with him. He makes it back to his house unscathed, but when he comes down for dinner, his mom calls his name out from behind him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s her <em>disappointed mom</em> voice, and Derek freezes. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s even bothering\u2014he\u2019s nearly incapable of lying to his mother, which he\u2019s pretty sure would still be true even if she weren\u2019t a werewolf\u2014but he pastes on an innocent look anyway as he turns to look at her. Her head is tilted, her eyebrows raised, and yep, she definitely knows. <em>Fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is serious,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the future of our family\u2014our pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, suitably chastised. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ll stop. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, I know this is overwhelming for everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>She holds her arms out, and Derek gratefully steps into them.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Derek gets to school early to meet Stiles at his locker and confesses. To his somewhat surprise, Stiles has come to a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says, his gaze at Derek\u2019s feet. \u201cI felt guilty after you left, and I don\u2019t wanna ever feel guilty about being with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and licks his lips. \u201cSo we\u2019re\u2026broken up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he says, heaving a sigh. \u201cBut not\u2014not forever, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>His gaze jerks up, desperate and searching, and Derek wants nothing more than to kiss him. \u201cGod no,\u201d he says instead. \u201cAt least\u2026I don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Me neither.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek swallows, staring at Stiles\u2019 fingers where he\u2019s toying with the straps of his backpack. \u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna tell everyone? Our friends, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t tell them the <em>truth</em>, obviously. What if we, uh, say that we\u2019re nervous about maybe splitting up for college, or whatever, and have decided to take a break?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, nodding. He\u2019s a little nervous how quickly that idea came to Stiles. It seems like such a cliched high school relationship problem, unlike werewolves and magic and sparks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re really supposed to avoid each other?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods miserably. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about texting?\u201d he asks, his face brightening, and Derek winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t risk it,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. C\u2019mere.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hug, and Derek buries his face in Stiles\u2019 neck. He breathes in deep, indulging himself more than usual as he takes in Stiles\u2019 scent. This is overly dramatic, he knows it it, but he is 18 fucking years old, and the thought of spending a month without his boyfriend sounds like torture.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust think of how good the make-up sex will be,\u201d Stiles whispers, right into his ear, and Derek laughs.</p>\n<p>The next four weeks are\u2026rough. It\u2019s awkward at school, where Derek still has to have classes with Stiles, still has to deal with all of their friends believing that they\u2019ve actually broken up. He spends more with Erica and Boyd and Isaac, who seem to have taken his \u201cside\u201d in the whole ordeal, and he has to appropriately fake feeling upset about the whole thing.</p>\n<p>Not that it always feels fake. He keeps thinking of things that he wants to text Stiles, anything little or silly that reminds him of Stiles. And Stiles still has to keep in touch with the pack, of course, and spends a lot of time with Derek\u2019s mom and various other family members, which drives Derek crazy because he can <em>sense</em> him, on people and at the house, but he can\u2019t do anything about it. He tries to pry a little, attempts to figure out how Stiles\u2019 training is going, but everyone remains fairly tight-lipped about it.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s going a little bit crazy.</p>\n<p>Not being with Derek <em>sucks</em>.</p>\n<p>Stiles is trying to be an adult about it\u2014it\u2019s no big deal, it\u2019s only for a month, yadda yadda yadda\u2014but he really misses him. Plus, Stiles is fucking <em>magic</em>, apparently, and he\u2019s still dealing with the whole supernatural-creatures-exist-what-the-fuck crisis, which he could really use Derek\u2019s help with.</p>\n<p>At least Stiles is staying pretty busy with school\u2014he\u2019s also missing Derek\u2019s help with physics and calc, by the way\u2014and the sessions he has to do with Deaton and Talia. Deaton is still way too cagey for his tastes, but they\u2019re managing. He has this nasty habit of making Stiles do things without telling him <em>why</em> he\u2019s doing it, which pisses Stiles off more than anything.</p>\n<p>But it pisses Talia off, too, which is pretty hilarious, and she and Stiles bond over that. A lot of Stiles\u2019 work with Deaton is on his own, learning how to control his spark, but Deaton also has him doing exercises with Talia to \u201ctest the emissary-alpha\u201d bond, or whatever BS he feels like spilling that day.</p>\n<p>And even outside the physical training, he gets enough reading assignments from Deaton that it\u2019s practically another class\u2014history about the Hale pack, history about werewolves in <em>general</em>, details about all the various runes and rituals that he\u2019s expected to know, etc. Peter\u2019s been helpful with that, too, and the research-loving part of Stiles\u2019 brain, the part that likes to fixate on things, is really enjoying it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still a shock, of course\u2014<em>werewolves</em>, what the fuck\u2014but all the new things he gets to learn, the fact that he is actually playing a pivotal role\u2026well that\u2019s pretty fucking cool.</p>\n<p>But honestly, all Stiles wants to do is talk to Derek about all the cool things he\u2019s learning. He has to suppress himself about a dozen times a day from texting him things like <em>have you ever met a faerie?? </em>and <em>I made fire today, ON PURPOSE this time</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally, after four weeks and five days\u2014not that Stiles has been keeping track or anything\u2014he gets a text from his dad asking him to go to the Hales\u2019 after school. He speeds over there, singing along obnoxiously with the radio and tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. Their break is over, Stiles can <em>feel it</em>. Hugs and kisses and orgasms are on the horizon, he can\u2019t fucking wait.</p>\n<p>He trips getting out of the Jeep and practically runs up the steps and into the Hales\u2019 living room. Everyone is there, but Stiles has eyes only for Derek, who\u2019s lounging on the couch looking more attractive than anyone has the right to be. He shoots Stiles a small smile and winks.</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows, and it only vaguely registers when his dad greets him and asks him to sit down. He sees Derek at school, of course, but they\u2019ve done a really good job at mostly avoiding each other, partly just to keep up appearances with their friends. So now that they\u2019re actually in the same room, Stiles is having trouble curbing the urge to climb him like a tree.</p>\n<p>He shamelessly fishes his phone out of his pocket and slouches down so he can text without anyone looking over his shoulder. He\u2019s aware that everyone will know what they\u2019re doing, but he doesn\u2019t really care. With all the sensitive ears, this is really best option without escaping to Derek\u2019s room, which he\u2019s pretty sure they won\u2019t let them do.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>Is it over??</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>I don't know, I hope so.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>You gotta try to calm down, I can literally smell your arousal.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Stiles: </b></span>I don\u2019t really see that as a bad thing.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"hide\"><b>Derek: </b></span>Means my mom can, too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>Well now Stiles will be lucky if he gets an erection ever again. He slides his phone back into his pocket with a grimace, and Derek just smirks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d his dad asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles answers, too quickly. \u201cSo is it over?\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia smiles at him. \u201cYes. Deaton has been very impressed with your progress so far\u201d\u2014news to Stiles\u2014\u201cand we can start preparing for the official bonding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles barely suppresses the urge to jump up on the couch and do a little dance. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d he says instead, trying to sound cool, even though he\u2019s pretty sure that his voice gives him away. But Derek is grinning, too, and Stiles is itching to touch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCurfew stays the same,\u201d his dad warns. \u201cAnd school still comes first, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on everyone\u2019s grades.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Stiles says quickly. He would agree to basically anything right now, honestly, because his brain is a little distracted by staring at Derek. He takes a step toward him, assuming that the official discussion part of this is over, but his dad catches him by the hood of his sweatshirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Stiles, you\u2019re coming home with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d He bites his lip as he looks between Derek and his dad. \u201c<em>Da-ad</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad grins. \u201cYou\u2019ve been complaining all week about that history test tomorrow. Now you can prove to me that you meant it when you just said you would put schoolwork first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says mulishly. He squirms out of his dad\u2019s hold and darts over to give Derek a kiss on the cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Friday, you two can see each other this weekend,\u201d Talia says, and Stiles mournfully follows his dad out the door.</p>\n<p>They stop to get takeout on the way home and eat on the couch while watching one of those police procedurals that his dad loves to berate for its lack of adherence to actual police procedure. Stiles gets in about an hour of modestly-productive studying for his history test, though he\u2019s alternately distracted by the pile of reading from Deaton on his bedside table and the temptation of texting Derek.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a rap of something sharp on his bedroom window, and Stiles nearly falls out of his chair when the window opens and Derek crawls through. \u201cJesus Christ, you almost gave me a heart attack,\u201d Stiles hisses, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from scrambling to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Derek says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck did you even get up here?\u201d Stiles asks, then thinks about it for half a second and answers his own question. \u201cDuh. Werewolf, right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins at him and slides an arm around his waist, pulling him close. Oh, yeah, kissing is a thing that they should definitely be doing. Stiles slings both arms around Derek\u2019s neck and bumps their noses together in his eagerness\u2014he\u2019s a little bit out of practice.</p>\n<p>Stiles is panting when they pull apart, and he leans his forehead against Derek\u2019s. \u201cSo, uh, why\u2019d you come over here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek ducks in for another short kiss and shrugs a little, with an adorably bashful look on his face. \u201cJust this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you seriously ran all the way over here just to give me a goodnight kiss?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I love you,\u201d Stiles says, laughing, and then he freezes. Derek stills, too, but he tightens his grip on Stiles\u2019 waist and holds his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he says seriously, and Stiles swallows around the sudden lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Uh, really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says, laughing, and Stiles laughs, too, ducking his face into Derek\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. It just kinda slipped out. I meant it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles kisses the spot under his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo your parents know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t stop me. I shouldn\u2019t stay long, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I definitely don\u2019t want my dad to know that you can sneak into my room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs and kisses him again, lush and sweet. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I missed you, too. Everything has just been <em>insane</em>, and it sucked that I couldn\u2019t talk to you about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all been going well, though? That\u2019s what my mom\u2019s been saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s awesome. I can make <em>fire</em>. On purpose. And all sorts of other cool shit. And Deaton took me out to the territory borders so I can start working on all the runes. Remember when we went running that day in the preserve and I felt really weird? That clearing is one of the borders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go running again, you\u2019ll have to show me,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, I learned something else cool, wanna see?\u201d Derek nods, and Stiles reaches for the small jar on the corner of his desk. \u201cTrust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Derek says automatically, and Stiles grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome. Just stand right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He twists open the jar, and Derek takes an immediate step backward, his eyes wide. \u201cShit, is that mountain ash?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Kate used to trap everyone inside the house.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>. Stiles\u2019 mouth drops open, and he holds the jar farther away from himself, as if more distance will make it better. \u201cOh god, I\u2019m so sorry, I had no idea. I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek swallows visibly and shakes his head. \u201cNo, do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he asks, and Derek gestures toward him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUse it. I wanna see what you learned.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head frantically. \u201cNo,\u201d he says immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d Derek says, his eyes soft, and <em>wow</em>, all of a sudden this feels bigger than when Derek said that he loved him. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes Derek repeat himself about three more times, but he finally starts to sprinkle the ash in a circle around Derek\u2019s feet. \u201cAre you <em>sure</em>?\u201d he asks again, when he\u2019s about halfway done, and Derek nods.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a deep breath and uses his belief and his intention to close the circle, just like he\u2019s practiced. It\u2019s working, he can feel it, and Derek bounces off the circle when he tries to take a step forward.</p>\n<p>He uses his foot to break the circle, and as soon as Derek steps free, Stiles breaks into a grin. \u201cHoly crap, that\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery cool,\u201d Derek agrees. \u201cPlease use your powers for good instead of evil.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs and fists a hand in Derek\u2019s shirt to tug him closer. \u201cWell, since I love you and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles exhales and nods. Talia smiles at him and pulls him into a hug. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Stiles. I love you, and I\u2019m very glad that you\u2019re part of our family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says into her shoulder. \u201cI am, too. So much.\u201d</p>\n<p>She squeezes his shoulder and grins. \u201cThen let\u2019s go do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark, the moon hanging full and bright in the sky, and the entire Hale pack is gathered in the backyard. The werewolves are all jittery, roaming around in various stages of their beta shifts, and the humans are clearly feeding off their energy.</p>\n<p>Stiles follows Talia through the crowd and joins her on a little mini-stage that someone has set up near the edge of the trees. As soon as she clears her throat, everyone quiets down and comes to surround them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMieczyslaw Stilinski,\u201d she says, and Stiles winces. Everyone else laughs, his dad loudest of all.</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, how did you even <em>know</em> that,\u201d he complains. \u201cAnd pronounce it correctly, even.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing,\u201d Talia says slyly. She says a few words, about the role of an emissary within the pack and about honoring the memory of their former emissary Bernadette. \u201cYou ready?\u201d she says to him quietly, and Stiles nods before stripping off his shirt. He inhales through his nose and clears his mind, preparing his body and his spark for the bond, exactly like he\u2019s been practicing.</p>\n<p>Talia\u2019s claw is sharp as she carefully carves a triskelion into the skin of Stiles\u2019 chest, right above his heart. It hurts, but he grits his teeth and focuses on his spark. Then it\u2019s done, and Stiles feels closer than ever to his magic, like it\u2019s simmering right at the surface and ready to do whatever he asks of it. The power is intoxicating, and all the possibilities are welling up in his throat, nearly enough to choke him. He could create fire, wind, lightning\u2026anything.</p>\n<p>Talia presses a cloth over the wound, and Stiles opens his eyes, not even realizing that he\u2019d closed them. Everyone\u2019s staring at him, all looking slightly awed. Maybe he <em>feels</em> different to them, he has no idea. His gaze meets theirs\u2014his dad, Derek, Laura, the kids\u2014and he knows that he would burn the earth to the ground for them. Stiles exhales and tries to keep a lid on the emotions swelling within him.</p>\n<p>When she takes the cloth away, the triskelion is red and raw-looking, but it appears to be mostly healed. Stiles pokes at it curiously, but it\u2019s just a little sore, not really painful. Magical healing, clearly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bowl, please,\u201d Talia says, breaking his reverie, and Laura hands over a wide wooden bowl filled with a brown substance.</p>\n<p>Stiles has no idea what\u2019s in it\u2014Deaton wouldn\u2019t tell him, <em>obviously</em>\u2014but it smells pleasant enough, kind of woodsy and cinnamony. In order of pack hierarchy, everyone dips their fingers in the mixture and makes some kind of mark on Stiles\u2019 skin before touching the triskelion.</p>\n<p>Derek goes last, for reasons that Stiles doesn\u2019t entirely understand, and swipes up the remains of the mixture on his fingertips. Everyone else has so far avoided drawing on the triskelion, but Derek draws traces right over it. When he lays his palm over the triskelion, it vibrates, sending a little shock through both of them. Derek\u2019s gaze snaps to his, but all Stiles can do is shrug. It certainly didn\u2019t do that for anyone else.</p>\n<p>Talia gives the pack\u2019s traditional full moon blessings and then sends them all off into the woods. Stiles takes off, fully enjoying his enhanced speed\u2014he\u2019s definitely faster when he\u2019s surrounded by so much pack energy. He attempts to evade Derek as long as possible, doubling back on his tracks and even shifting the wind to mask his scent.</p>\n<p>But Derek is gaining on him, Stiles can tell, and he changes directions just in time to be thrown down into a relatively-comfortable pile of leaves when Derek tackles him from behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were trying to throw me off.\u201d</p>\n<p>His words are slightly slurred around his fangs, and Stiles grins against the leaves. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I caught you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wiggles in an attempt to dislodge a particularly scratchy leaf and flips around in Derek\u2019s grip. By the time they\u2019re facing each other, Derek\u2019s face is fully human.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek cuts himself off and shakes his head, dipping down to bite gently at Stiles\u2019 neck. Stiles tilts his head to give him more room and cards a hand through Derek\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so powerful, I can feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know what <em>I </em>can feel?\u201d Stiles asks, moving his leg between Derek\u2019s, and Derek laughs into his neck. He grinds down once, and Stiles groans. \u201cOh my god, you horndog, we cannot do that here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater, then.\u201d Derek slides his lips across Stiles\u2019 skin until they reach his lips, and the kiss is lazy and slow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bet your ass later.\u201d</p>"
