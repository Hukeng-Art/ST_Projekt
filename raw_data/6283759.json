  "text": "<p>The Force whispers in its ageless voice, its touch peaceful and lulling against Vader\u2019s ancient soul, \u201cTell me your biggest regrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>i.</b>\n</p>\n<p>The first time, Anakin kills Obi-Wan.</p>\n<p>Two rays of ethereal blue clash and clash against the fiery hell of Mustafar\u2014harsh, violent, and unrelenting as they traverse in an inexorable pattern of swing and dip, push and pull. Each inhale casts cinders to Anakin\u2019s paper lungs, each tireless step upheaves the black gravel beneath. Anakin forces his old Master to retreat, until lava chars the backs of his stumbling heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnakin!\u201d Obi-Wan shouts, but his pleas fall to deaf ears. \u201cAnakin!\u201d</p>\n<p>With rage roaring in his veins, Anakin poises his lightsaber for execution, his vision as red as the blood-soaked sky of this firestorm planet. He cuts Obi-Wan down with an unwavering resolve and leaves the Jedi to collapse at his feet, the black-crusted gash of cauterized flesh marring Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulder, his chest, and across his heart.</p>\n<p>Anakin stands over the fallen Jedi and watches the pain on his face ease, the stormy blue of his eyes fading to lifeless gray. He waits for a dying word, a final taunt from that clever mind and razor-sharp tongue that somehow will twist into Vader\u2019s blackened heart, evoking pain and unspeakable misery from a part of himself that begs for death as his old Master dies before him.</p>\n<p>But no words part with those waning breaths. Only silence echoes hollowly in Anakin\u2019s ears.</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Vader returns to the present to find his body intact, his skin smooth and untouched by the fires of Mustafar. He removes his mask and inhales, the artificially cool air tasting nothing short of sweet and soothing on his ravished tongue.</p>\n<p>Padm\u00e9 is still dead, their child still gone. Even Palpatine has passed some years ago, slain by his young apprentice who had surpassed him in power, swiftly and without pity.</p>\n<p>Vader sits on his empiric throne aboard his monstrous, metal planet, terrorizing the galaxy in his right as the new Galactic Emperor, the last Sith Lord\u2014powerful, untouchable, eternally alone.</p>\n<p>Not even Obi-Wan\u2019s ghost visits him in his dreamless sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>ii.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Anakin saves Padm\u00e9.</p>\n<p>He sends clones to her apartment on Coruscant and relocates her to the safety of the Emperor\u2019s starship before he even lands a foot on Mustafar. Afterwards, with the adrenaline of combat still\u00a0rushing\u00a0in his blood, sweat and ashes tangled in his unruly hair, Anakin returns to find Padm\u00e9 in his personal chamber\u2014heartbroken, heavily pregnant, but <em>alive</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cObi-Wan was right,\u201d her voice quivers, \u201cYou\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more about Obi-Wan,\u201d Anakin responds coldly, and Padm\u00e9\u2019s face crumbles, her shoulders trembling as she openly sobs, and even then, Anakin finds her achingly beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down a path I can\u2019t follow! You\u2019re breaking my heart!\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin grits his teeth, forcing away the familiar rage, the burning betrayal upon learning that Padm\u00e9\u2014his love, his <em>wife</em>\u2014would cast him away after all that he has done to save her, to ensure a future for their unborn child.</p>\n<p>He leaves without another word, terrified of what he\u00a0might do in his emotional tumult. Only when he reaches the seclusion of an empty sparring chamber does he roar with reckless abandon, unleashing from his heart the black dragon that whispers his fears and strangles his soul.</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>In the weeks that follow, Anakin keeps Padm\u00e9 safe, living in luxury and served with the richest, most delectable foods the galaxy has to offer. He brings her crowns made from Maelibi gold, jewels found among collapsing stars, and the finest silks and satins weaved by Lashaani maidens. He promises riches and prosperity for her people on Naboo, monuments in her name and in the names of their child and future children. He does everything he can for her, caters to her every whim, stopping only short of kneeling at her feet and begging for forgiveness.</p>\n<p>\u201cPadm\u00e9,\u201d he whispers, threading a gentle hand through the lavish, brown waves that spill across her shoulders, down her back, \u201cJoin me, please, Padm\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns from him the moment fingers touch skin\u2014her jaws firm, her expression impassive, her doleful, dark eyes brimming with a hatred that pricks ice into his veins.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave,\u201d she whispers, just as last night, and the nights before. Anakin stiffens under her stare, thins his lips, and obeys without a sound.</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>\u201cMedically, she\u2019s completely healthy. For reasons we can\u2019t explain, we are losing her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s dying?\u201d The cold bite of fear sinks into his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt appears,\u201d comes the infuriatingly, apathetic voice of the medical droid, \u201cShe has lost the will to live.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin\u2019s face twists in anger, his eyes unseeing towards the transparent wall between him and his dying wife. \u201cWhy?\u201d he demands viciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do not know, but we must operate quickly, if we are to save the babies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBabies?\u201d His voice hitches in his throat, as he spins around to face the droid only to find it already gone.</p>\n<p>Hours later, the droid returns, holding two small bundles in its metallic arms. Leia fusses and cries, her small body turning inside the sheets, tears spilling from dark, umber eyes\u2014<em>Padm\u00e9\u2019s eyes</em>. Meanwhile, Luke is calm and still beside his sister, and it takes a moment for Anakin to recognize the unmistakable blue\u2014luminous and clear like the skies of Tatooine. Those eyes, the eyes of his son, remind him wretchedly, achingly of a young man he once knew, who died beside his broken Master in the fires of Mustafar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>iii.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Anakin chooses Obi-Wan.</p>\n<p>He bolts down the peaceful halls of the Jedi temple, feeling every desperate step against the hard, unforgiving marble. The Chancellor\u2019s words rasp cruelly in his ears, taunting him, stirring the black dragon that weaves in his fears, his guilt.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Perhaps it\u2019s simply a question of whether you love Obi-Wan Kenobi more than you love your wife.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Years ago, lifetimes ago, Anakin had chosen Padm\u00e9, but not this life, not this moment. He will not abandon Obi-Wan a second time.</p>\n<p>A meeting is in session, with all the Masters gathered in the Council Hall behind the thick, impenetrable walls that insulate them from the rest of the world. Under Palpatine\u2019s personal request, Anakin has been granted the rank of Master, the Chancellor\u2019s representation in the Jedi Order. His omission from this meeting leaves a bitter twinge in his mouth, but that is beside the point, he reminds himself, as he shoves away the Jedi youngling guarding the entrance, bolting through the double doors to meet the stunned eyes of the Masters inside\u2014Obi-Wan\u2019s among them.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Chancellor is a Sith Lord!\u201d he shouts without a quiver of doubt.</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Anakin fights beside his former Master, their movements perfectly in sync in undulating phases of power and composure. Anakin attacks first, as he always does, lunging forward with swift, forceful strikes, driving their enemy to defend and jarring their self-assurance. Obi-Wan\u2019s movement would then merge seamlessly with Anakin\u2019s, clever and calculated and beautiful in its simplicity, taking advantage of the weaknesses revealed in the previous frenzy.</p>\n<p>They are a force to be reckoned with, the unstoppable heroes, the perfect team revered in all corners of the galaxy. They cannot lose\u2014certainly, they cannot\u2014not when they are fighting side by side, their bond through the Force so resonating, so complete, as if their very souls are merged to one.</p>\n<p>But they do falter, and Anakin knows, the moment he stumbles and falls as a bolt of Force lightning\u00a0jolts\u00a0through his veins. He collapses on the carpeted floor of the Chancellor\u2019s office, within the four walls of this garish trap that he had willingly entered so many times as a foolish young Knight, spilling his secrets of fear, anger, jealousy, and disappointment. Anakin flutters close his eyes, willing away the regret threatening to tarnish his unwavering hope. This time is different. This time he will set things right. He has Obi-Wan by his side.</p>\n<p>Paralyzed from the pain, Anakin needs time to recover, and it leaves him open, poised, and ready for execution. He can only watch on, blearily with half-hooded eyes, as Obi-Wan guards him in his momentary weakness, defending against the Sith Lord alone.</p>\n<p>A diagonal swing leaves him vulnerable on the left, and if Anakin had been by his side, the weakness would undoubtedly be protected. Instead, Anakin is on the floor, useless and horrified, as he watches a flash of red disappear into Obi-Wan\u2019s stiffening body, through the gaps in his ribcage and into the chamber of his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p>\n<p>A familiar darkness twists in his heart, as his former Master falls to the feet of a Sith.</p>\n<p>Anakin pushes himself to stand and lunges at the Chancellor\u2014no gimmicks, no rules this time, just raw power and unadulterated hatred. One, two, three blows are all it takes to disarm the Dark Lord, leaving the gray, wrinkled monster scrabbling on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-No, don\u2019t kill me. I can train you, young Skywalker. Help you purge this fear from your heart, I can\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin inhales and closes his eyes, and then, there is silence.</p>\n<p>He rushes to Obi-Wan, hovering once again over his former Master\u2019s dying body, but this time, he crumbles to his knees, anguish and grief shaking his core.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be alright,\u201d the quiver in his voice betrays him, hot tears wetting his cheeks. \u201cJust hang on, help is on the way. You\u2019ll be alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan blinks slowly at him, mustering the last of his strength to\u00a0touch Anakin\u2019s face. With his thumb, he smears a tear welling just beneath his lashes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell done, Anakin.\u201d The blue of his eyes are fading, but the smile he wears is serene. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Anakin emerges a hero but rescinds the Jedi Order upon his return to the Temple. Padm\u00e9 is alive and well, giving birth shortly to two healthy babies\u2014Luke and Leia Skywalker. Anakin leaves with her to Naboo, where they raise their children in happy, peaceful bliss, surrounded by lush gardens and perpetual sun.</p>\n<p>Leia grows up to be a headstrong, energetic young girl\u2014dark-haired, dark-eyed like her mother, but possessing all the petulant curiosity of his father. Luke, meanwhile, has sandy blond hair and impossibly blue eyes, an uncanny doppelganger of Anakin as a boy on Tatooine. But from his mother, he inherited gentleness and serenity. He will be a better man than Anakin would ever hope to be.</p>\n<p>Both of his children are strong with the Force. Both Anakin loves with all his heart.</p>\n<p>Five years pass, and they are as content as they can be, except for the days surrounding the anniversary of the new Republic\u2019s rise. His family knows not to trouble him during these trying times, as he locks himself away in the lonely hours of the night, brooding in darkness with only a bottle of Corellian rum for company.</p>\n<p><em>Obi-Wan would be proud</em>, Anakin tells himself. <em>Obi-Wan is dead</em>, comes the resounding truth.</p>\n<p>He smashes the bottle in his drunken misery, his anguish ripping from his throat and into the taunting silence. Not even in a life where he is happy\u2014with his loving wife and two beautiful children\u2014can he cope with the loss of Obi-Wan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>iv.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Anakin returns angry.</p>\n<p>He storms down the empty corridor of the Republic cruiser with only one goal in mind, and when the doors of Obi-Wan\u2019s bedchamber slides open, he barges in without a word.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnakin\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of the protest is muffled by his lips against Obi-Wan\u2019s, as the young Knight presses his former Master against the nearest durasteel wall, framing the older Jedi with a firm grip on each side. Obi-Wan shifts and twists beneath his touch, blue-gray eyes wide with shock. His words are swallowed once again, when Anakin licks between his parted lips.</p>\n<p>Anakin already knows what Obi-Wan has to say, and he has had lifetimes to ponder a proper response. He is Obi-Wan\u2019s former Padawan, and the sixteen years that separate them are nevertheless significant. Though the Council does not strictly demand celibacy even between Jedi, loose morals are adamantly frowned upon, especially for a newly ranked Master serving as an example to his Jedi learners. And most importantly of all, attachment is forbidden, but Anakin can hardly care at this point, as self-aware as he is of their hypocrisy and pretense.</p>\n<p>Time and again, they have risked their lives for one another, compromised their ethics, wavered in their faith. Faded is their Master-Padawan bond, dutifully severed with Anakin\u2019s braid, but in its place emerged something far more potent that simmered with an intensity beyond the oath between brothers, the longing between lovers. It is a connection that has no language to manifest itself, no outlet from the unfitting cages of their chests or the wordless bemusement in their minds.</p>\n<p>They are attached, whether Obi-Wan admits it or not. So what is one more thing to add to their list of grievances? One more spiral down this vicious, endless cycle?</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan wants him too. There is little doubt in Anakin\u2019s mind from the way he would catch his former Master\u2019s eyes linger as they spar, or the faint blush that would tint his cheeks whenever Anakin leaned close to whisper something that very well could have been divulged aloud. Even as they kiss now, Anakin can feel Obi-Wan shift against him in an unimpressive attempt to hide the maddening hardness between his legs. Cruelly, Anakin presses his thigh against it, drawing a surprised gasp. Of all the emotions Obi-Wan conceals so masterfully behind his calm fa\u00e7ade, desire is not one of them.</p>\n<p>Anakin takes Obi-Wan\u2014rough, hungry, dominating, and possessive\u2014manhandling him until he is on his stomach, pulling at his hips with a grip hard enough to bruise. He thrusts at a fast, punishing pace, teeth tearing into shoulder as he marks Obi-Wan, claims him, <em>owns</em> him.</p>\n<p>He probably should have taken longer to prepare, slicked them both with something more than pre-come and saliva, but these are merely afterthoughts as Anakin grinds into the tight, consuming heat, spreading himself on top of Obi-Wan and crushing him against the mattress, pressing his chin to the crook of his former Master's shoulder to listen to the quiet gasps and moans.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnakin. Oh, Anakin,\u201d Obi-Wan murmurs, his voice soft and caressing, a stunning contrast to Anakin\u2019s raw, brutal strength. Anakin reaches around him and grips his length, stroking in the same relentless rhythm.</p>\n<p>When Obi-Wan comes, Anakin feels him tighten impossibly, waves of bliss undulating across their bond and sending molten fire through his veins. Anakin joins soon after, his moan strangled against Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulder as every shred of pleasure is wrenched from him, leaving him boneless and spent.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, he settles in the warm embrace, heartbeat languid and eyes laden with sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, Obi-Wan,\u201d he confides to the darkness and feels a soft thrum along their undeniable and unbreakable bond.</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan falls. And oh, does he fall.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use!\u201d Aayla Secura frantically shouts into her damaged transmitter. \u201cWe\u2019ve been outmaneuvered. He has the exit gate surrounded, and we only have\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The call ends abruptly with a sizzle of static, leaving only stony silence inside the Council Hall. Anakin shifts uncomfortably, the emptiness of the seat beside him a stagnant distraction in the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>Mace Windu is the first to speak. \u201cThe closest Jedi are Master Billaba and Padawan Dume, but they are preoccupied with their assignment on Umbara.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoda\u2019s wizened lips thin to a small, grim line. \u201cSpread thin, the Jedi are, but send a rescue mission, we must.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, let me go!\u201d Anakin shouts, as all eyes fall on him, mixed with varying degrees of scrutiny and reservation. <em>Unbecoming of a Master</em>, Obi-Wan\u2019s voice echoes in his memory, but his former Master is not here anymore. \u201cYou can\u2019t just keep me locked up in the Temple when we\u2019re losing Jedi left and right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwisted by darkness, your former Master has become.\u201d Yoda\u2019s refusal is infuriatingly calm, untouched by the younger Jedi\u2019s outburst. \u201cThe man you knew, gone he is. Clouded by fear, your judgment is. A suitable mission for you, this is not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can bring him back,\u201d Anakin insists, his voice steady despite a darkness looming in his heart, \u201cI know I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>His efforts are useless\u2014Anakin soon realizes\u2014even after his persistence have grated the Council\u2019s last nerve, before Master Windu finally granted him the go ahead to depart for Dantooine. There, Anakin spends months on the arid, savanna planet chasing ghosts, arriving always a fraction too late, and finding only Obi-Wan\u2019s taunting Force energy among the ruins they search.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan is clever, masterful, and above all deceptive, and perhaps the Jedi never truly appreciated his ingenuity until he has fallen to the Dark Side. They lose their hold on the distal posts of the Outer Rim, as well as support from key planet systems whose leaders were swayed by the luring words of the former Negotiator. War continues to rage in the sky, earth, and seas, but Anakin forces himself to turn a blind eye for now. His mission is to bring back Obi-Wan\u2014safe, sane, and sound\u2014and until then, the galaxy will have to wait.</p>\n<p>Another month passes, before a distress call from Coruscant sends Anakin rushing back, swallowing the horror in his throat as he steps over the bodies of fallen Jedi, young and old alike, littered in a trail of death to the forbidden Jedi Archives. Anakin descends the winding stairs\u2014his eyes unfocused, his heart echoing in his ears\u2014and finds Master Yoda at the base, head bowed and shoulders hunched before the open Holocron vault.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster,\u201d he whispers, misery brimming from his failing shields, \u201cI must know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoda shakes his head sullenly. \u201cIf into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>If every action is but a ripple in the waters of fate, then all streams must lead to Mustafar somehow. Anakin contemplates as he faces the image of his former Master, hooded in a brown dark enough to be black, with awful gold speckled inside irises once lucid, pure, and blue.</p>\n<p>Guilt. Obi-Wan has always been driven by guilt. Guilt over Qui-Gon\u2019s death, Darth Maul\u2019s revenge, and in many lifetimes, but not this one, Anakin\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p>But in this life, Anakin has given him something new to feel guilty about.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Obi-Wan had stumbled over his words that night, an uncharacteristic nervousness and fear strumming in their shared bond.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWe can\u2019t, Anakin. It\u2019s too dangerous\u2014We\u2019re Jedi, and this kind of\u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThis kind of what?\u201d Anakin bit harshly.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014Attachment.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s voice is stiff. \u201cIt will only lead to suffering. I cannot share this with you any longer, even though I wish I could.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Anakin felt his heart clench and his stomach turn, the fire of his anger consuming the sullenness of rejection. \u201cWhy?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cJedi must let go of their attachment.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let go\u2014\u201d Anakin shouted, \u201c\u2014Of this sanctimonious, deceitful, self-punishing Code? What do you wish to gain from this deprivation? To hold yourself above love and loss, so you can say you\u2019re better than everyone?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Obi-Wan looked visibly taken aback, marginally appalled. \u201cThese are the vows we took as Jedi.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAnd we have broken them, long before this\u2014\u201d Anakin waved indignantly with his durasteel hand. \u201c\u2014Any of this, even happened. You brought me here, you trained me, you loved me! It\u2019s your fault that I love you back! I\u2019m like this because of you, so don\u2019t think you can just tell me to let go as if it\u2019s some magical solution. You can be the perfect Jedi, Obi-Wan, but you will die loveless and alone, detached and forgotten\u2014is this what you want? Is this what you want for me?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Obi-Wan grew pale, pain shown vividly in his defenseless blue eyes as he inadvertently took a step backwards. Only then did Anakin restrain from his Force-driven rage, blind anger dissipating long enough to feel the profound sorrow humming through the Force. They were connected now, infinitely and irrevocably. Fear sank in his chest, as Anakin wondered what Obi-Wan must have felt on his end\u2014the searing, black dragon that strangled him with its taunting whispers and eyes of dead stars.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Anakin watched as Obi-Wan moved past him, collapsing into the chair by his writing desk. He reached a hand to his forehead, shielding his eyes but not the silent tears wetting his cheeks. Anakin\u2019s apology afterwards never really quite cut it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And here they stand, on opposite sides of a great chasm, hell rumbling beneath their feet. Through the power of the Dark, did Obi-Wan wish to absolve himself of this guilt? If anything, Anakin should be the one consumed by regret\u2014more regret than his former Master can possibly accumulate in all his lifetimes combined.</p>\n<p>\u201cJoin me, Anakin,\u201d Obi-Wan shouts, \u201cOn the Dark Side, we can be together!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no we can\u2019t,\u201d Anakin returns, soul aching, \u201cThe darkness consumes all. I know this, Obi-Wan. I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anger twists into those features, a cruel insult to the memory of the good man, the revered Master. \u201cIf you are not with me, then you\u2019re my enemy!\u201d</p>\n<p>They strike and parry for what feels like an eternity, but only one can rise victorious. Anakin watches helplessly as his Master lies in pieces before him\u2014consumed by hatred, by pain\u2014chin pressed to the dark sands of Mustafar and robes catching ablaze in the impending sea of lava.</p>\n<p>Anakin aches\u2014wretchedly and unbearably\u2014to know that Obi-Wan has fallen because of him, because of the mistakes he had made in his selfish desperation. Towering over Obi-Wan, he cannot even begin to fathom the profoundness of his failure to a man he has both loved with wild abandon and destroyed irreparably.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d Obi-Wan shouts, as the smell of burnt, bubbling flesh\u00a0enters Anakin\u2019s nostrils, stirring nausea into his clenching gut.</p>\n<p>He decides this is the worst of his lives, yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>v.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Anakin saves his mother.</p>\n<p>He abandons his post the moment they arrive\u00a0on Coruscant, leaving Obi-Wan to handle the briefings alone. He never reacquaints with Padm\u00e9.</p>\n<p>Anakin pilots a small starfighter to Tatooine and finds Cliegg Lars by his moisture farm, banding together his small group of brave men to rescue his wife from the Tusken Raiders.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Anakin Skywalker, son of Shmi!\u201d he shouts, stumbling across the desert dune just in time to halt their departure. \u201cLet me come with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>The sand wanderers stood no chance, as Anakin tore and pillaged through their clan, striking down all who dared to obstruct his path. No moisture farmers died that day, and neither did Lars lose his leg. They find Shmi bound in a secluded hut, her hair windswept and disheveled and the hem of her sandy dress torn to shreds. A bruise blooms high on her cheekbone, her lower lip split and bloodied, but otherwise, she appears whole\u2014terrified but alive.</p>\n<p>Anakin frees her from her ropes, falling into her embrace as she laughs and sighs in disbelief. \u201cAni. Oh, Ani. Is that you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Mom.\u201d He wraps his arms around her trembling form, feeling every bone within her fragile, breakable body. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you look so handsome, my son. My grown-up son,\u201d she smiles at him through her tears. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Ani.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin swallows the lump in his throat, burying himself into her chest, just as he did as a boy of nine years.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, Mom,\u201d he sobs into the folds of her dress, \u201cI missed you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Anakin paid little regard to the injury he sustained during the rescue, a small gash on his side a few centimeters long, which drew a decent volume of blood but not deep enough to reach bone. But the sand and dirt of Tatooine caused his wound to fester, a fever igniting his already burning flesh as they trek beneath the unforgiving sun. Anakin collapses into a heap only an hour into their journey home on the second day.</p>\n<p>When he wakes, he sees Beru gently cleaning his wound, reapplying fresh bandages to his flank.</p>\n<p>\u201cMom,\u201d he startles in his cot. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mom? Is she alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShmi is tending to the farms with Cliegg,\u201d Beru\u2019s voice is gentle despite the firm hands holding him still. \u201cYou need not to worry. She has recovered fully.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin stares at her long and hard, before finally settling into his sheets once more. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks blearily.</p>\n<p>\u201cSun poisoning, a bad infection, and no immediate access to medical supplies,\u201d Beru explains, \u201cYou were delirious with a fever. But it\u2019s gone now\u2014mostly. You still need time before regaining your strength.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime,\u201d he repeats, and suddenly, panic rises in his chest. \u201cHow much time has passed since\u2014since we returned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Two weeks?</em>\u201d he shouts, jolting from the cot and knocking over the small basin of water by his feet. He stumbles into the living quarters, ignoring Beru\u2019s protests and grasping for his Commlink on the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>Padm\u00e9 was assassinated in her apartment on Coruscant. Obi-Wan died on Ryloth, his body recovered just yesterday, battered and broken within an abandoned Separatist stronghold. His Master\u2019s distress call for Anakin to retransmit to Coruscant was never received.</p>\n<p>On the brink of dusk, Anakin takes his lightsaber and steps onto the burning sand, ambling aimlessly towards the blood-red suns. His weapon switches on with a familiar drone, strumming against his ear as he shears off his Padawan braid and drops it to the grains beneath his feet. It is a long, thin ribbon, grown throughout the span of ten years\u2014beginning and continuous since the moment he became Obi-Wan\u2019s Padawan and until now.</p>\n<p>Coruscant is light-years away, and truly, he has no right to return to the Temple now. Anakin watches as dunes of sand swallow the fiery suns, casting darkness into the sky to surround every pinprick star.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0 ~~</p>\n<p>The Sith overruns the Jedi, the galaxy falls apart. Five years later, Palpatine approaches Anakin in exile, aimless and broken from a hundred years\u2019 grief. The Emperor steps inside his small, sandy hut and extends a shriveled, gray hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are powerful in the way of the Force, young one. Fear, hatred, anger, despair\u2014you can harness them to your strength. I can show you how.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin laughs\u2014manically and hauntingly, he laughs\u2014and when he sees the look of startled bewilderment twisting into those hideous, wrinkled features, Anakin laughs even louder.</p>\n<p>\u201cJoin me, be my apprentice, and together, we can rule the galaxy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin spits on the hem of the Emperor\u2019s robes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>vi.</b>\n</p>\n<p>The last time, Anakin returns as a boy.</p>\n<p>The day Qui-Gon arrives in Mos Espa in search for parts, Anakin runs away to the market to hide among the storage behind tent shops. He curls into the sand mats and draws his knees close to make himself small. He has even packed a ration of granola to stave off hunger, as he waits with only the light of day as an indication of time passing by. He doesn\u2019t budge from his hiding spot until the suns hang low in the sky, and he doesn\u2019t dare to return home, until dawn breaks the next morning.</p>\n<p>Watto appears absolutely livid when he spots Anakin ambling into the junk shop. \u201cWhere have you been, boy?\u201d the Toydarian junk dealer rasps, gripping harshly onto Anakin's small shoulders, \u201cThink you can run away?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t running away!\u201d Anakin protests. \u201cAnd what does it matter, I\u2019m here now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Watto reaches for a\u00a0rough strip of leather piled atop of his scraps, certainly ready to beat him bloody, and Anakin stiffens his shoulders and pinches his eyes closed, readying himself for the blow.</p>\n<p>Someone enters the shop just then, and the possibility of them being a customer halts Watto mid-swing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Master was here yesterday,\u201d comes a familiar voice\u2014melodic, but sharp in a distinctively elegant Coruscanti accent. \u201cTo inquire about a T-14 hyperdrive generator.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking Republican credits,\u201d Watto wheezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am well aware. We now have something more <em>real</em> to offer, as you requested, and I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>During this brief exchange, Anakin has kept his head timidly bowed. He only dares to sneak a glance when the smooth, confident voice inexplicably tapers off, and looks up to find, staring back at him, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014still a Padawan by his bristly hair and single, long braid, and no beard to hide his boyishly handsome face.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan appears at a loss for words, brows furrowed bemusedly as he approaches, staring down at Anakin as if he had seen him in a dream that he could not quite remember. Anakin panics as the older man draws close, twisting in Watto\u2019s grip in an attempt to escape.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you, boy?\u201d Watto rasps, more surprised than offended.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Obi-Wan commands, his hand reaching for Anakin as well.</p>\n<p>Anakin screams and struggles, screams and screams, until his current Master and his Master in a different lifetime both release him as if they had been stunned. He scrambles away, knocking over scraps of metal as he staggers out the door, Watto\u2019s angry yowling fading as the distance between them stretches.</p>\n<p>As fast as his small feet can take him, Anakin traverses the busy market, tears spilling down his sun-burned cheeks and the image of Obi-Wan\u2019s startled bemusement branded in his memory.</p>\n<p>Two days pass before Obi-Wan haggles the generator from Watto, and the Jedi\u2019s ship leaves without their Chosen One, grounded in the endless sands of Tatooine.</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Anakin is no longer a Jedi, but he still has access to the Force, and the Force has been kind to him indeed, guiding him with gentle whispers and warnings of danger, allowing his reflexes to be lightning quick and his decisions fool-heartedly lucky to those watching with an untrained eye. That year, he becomes the first human to win the Boonta Eve Classic, earning enough credits to free both him and his mother from slavery.</p>\n<p>At first, they struggle with their newly earned freedom. Shmi finds a job clearing tables at the local cantina, while Anakin wanders around the market during the day, freelancing for work as a mechanic. They never manage to make enough credits to sustain a second home, until a moisture farmer by the name of Cliegg Lars, struck by the lightning bolt of love, stumbles into the cantina where Shmi works and proposes to Anakin\u2019s mother the same night.</p>\n<p>They move to Cliegg\u2019s moisture farm, and Anakin is ecstatic to finally have a room to himself, with the exception of his new half-brother Owen also living there, of course, but that is a minor detail he is willing to overlook.</p>\n<p>He grows tall and strong, his connection with the Force only deepening with age, brimming with confidence and raw power that allows him to ignite even the most battered cruisers to life. Anakin earns his living as a mechanic, a pilot, parting from Tatooine at the age of nineteen to explore the galaxy with merchants, smugglers, and bounty hunters.</p>\n<p>And when the time comes for the galaxy to tremble, Anakin perches on his stool inside a Corellian cantina, his drink barely touched, his soul in his throat, as he salvages every word transmitted from the flickering HoloNet News, of the skies above Coruscant exploding with fire in the final battle that would determine the fate of the galaxy. When the word finally arrives, the cantina erupts in deafening cheers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Separatists have surrendered!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Republic has won!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWar is over, finally! War is over, now!\u201d</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>The HoloNet broadcasts every\u00a0second\u00a0of the victory parade on Coruscant. Anakin watches Padm\u00e9 emerge from her Naboo cruiser, draped in rich velvet and glittering silver, her hair fashioned in an intricate, woven bun. Behind her are her husband\u2014the newly elected Senator of Taris\u2014and their three-year-old daughter. The camera zooms to Padm\u00e9's radiant, smiling face, before lowering to the swell of her belly, thinly concealed beneath her pleated dress. A part of Anakin aches deeply, knowing that their beautiful children will never exist in this life, but he braves a smile nonetheless, wishing Padm\u00e9 all the happiness in the galaxy.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan receives a medal for his courage, markedly for his ingenious tactics during the last battle of Coruscant, that allowed the Republic to infiltrate the Separatist battleship and reveal Chancellor Palpatine as the mastermind behind the Sith ploys. Anakin watches as he steps onto the platform, clad in white Jedi robes that is somehow both modest and stunning, a simple smile on his lips as he bows before the young Naboo Senator. Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014the name will be remembered in history as a fearless warrior, a cunning strategist, a noble Master, and the only Jedi to have defeated two Sith Lords in the darkest years of their millennia.</p>\n<p>Some find it enigmatic that a revered Jedi such as Obi-Wan has refused to take a learner, but Anakin supposes it\u2019s fitting that Obi-Wan would have no one else as his Padawan, just as Anakin would have no one else as his Master.</p>\n<p>Fate does bring them together, despite Anakin\u2019s adamant refusal to step anywhere near Coruscant, Alderaan, Naboo, any and every system that evokes the hauntingly sorrowful memories of lifetimes ago. His speeder breaks on the skylanes of Bespin, forcing him to pull over by the pedestrian paths beneath.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlasted thing,\u201d he curses under his breath, bending to inspect the black smoke gushing from a busted pipe. He will need to find a replacement before rewiring the generator, which of course, will require the expenditure of his remaining credits.</p>\n<p>Sighing, Anakin straightens beside his speeder, stretching out his lower back as he contemplates his methods. At least he is in the metropolis of Bespin instead of an arid, inhospitable planet like Tatooine.</p>\n<p>Something familiar tremors in the Force, and his eyes immediately lock to blue-gray irises from across the street, like the positive pole of a magnet finding the opposite. Obi-Wan stands motionless amidst the bustling crowd, a cacophony of emotions thinly disguised by a calm veneer. Only when a passing Rodian collides against his shoulder does the Jedi jolt into action.</p>\n<p>Anakin watches with rising panic as Obi-Wan weaves against the current of bodies between them. He contemplates running away, knowing he can certainly lose a pursuer in such a busy metropolis. Something keeps him planted to the ground, however, as his body shudders with anticipation, teeming with both wild hope and crushing dread.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan is close enough now, for him to recognize all those obscure emotions in the stormy blue\u2014bemusement, intrigue, trepidation, and a touch of recognition.</p>\n<p><em>Please</em>, Anakin squeezes his eyes shut, pleading to unknown deities and wishing he could disappear, <em> Nothing good will come of this. The galaxy will be torn apart. Please, please, leave.</em></p>\n<p>A hand reaches to his face, fitting the curve of his cheek perfectly into the calloused palm. Anakin\u2019s breath hitches, hot tears welling at the corners of his eyes. He feels a thumb swipe along his quivering lashes, catching on to the first drop before it falls.</p>\n<p>\u201cObi-Wan,\u201d Anakin rasps\u2014agony ripping at his heart, shame coloring his cheeks. Finally, he garners the courage to open his eyes.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan smiles through unshed tears. \u201cI missed you, my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p><em>It has been said something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.</em><br>\u2014Chaos Theory</p>"
