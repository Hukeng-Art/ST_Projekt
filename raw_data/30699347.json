  "text": "<p>The buzzing by Tim\u2019s ear was really starting to bug him. He was sleeping happily on the\u2014you know\u2014the place he was sleeping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe not that happily because it was kinda damp. And hard. And smelly. And there was that tinny buzzing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he <em> wasn\u2019t actually wearing clothes </em> oh gosh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim jerked upright, scrambling his way out of the cloth he was wrapped in. His eyes widened at the surroundings that greeted him\u2014metal dumpsters, tall brick walls rising on either side of him, chain-link fence stretching across one end of the alley. A dark atmosphere that was distinctly Gotham City.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The muggy chill in the air made him shiver and he turned back to the pile of cloth he was sitting atop. A black blanket was partially wrapped around the rest of the clothes laying limply on the ground and Tim hesitantly pulled it away from the rest of the bundle. He frowned at the hood-thing with eyes that came with it, along with a logo that looked kind of like a\u2026 hook? The hood\u2014on what he now recognized as a cloak\u2014looked a lot like Batman\u2019s cowl, but Gotham\u2019s protector would\u2019ve had the signature bat ears, and he certainly didn\u2019t have a gold logo like that. Tim huffed and wracked his brain trying to place it. <em> Hero or villain? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That buzzing happened again and broke Tim out of his thoughts. He moved to wrap the cloak around himself\u2014flinching when he brushed over a cut on his arm he didn\u2019t remember getting\u2014before poking around on the ground and unveiling a small plastic earbud. As he brought it closer to his face for inspection\u2014probably a terrible idea if this <em> was </em> a villain\u2019s stuff\u2014he realized the buzzing was just tiny voices coming from it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim weighed his options. He was alone at night in some alleyway in Gotham. He had nothing except the clothes left on the ground by someone and the cloak wrapped around his skinny shoulders. His camera was nowhere in sight. His backpack was gone too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Tim was being perfectly honest with himself, if this stuff belonged to a new Gotham Rogue, he knew he\u2019d have a better chance of getting help eventually if he was captured by them than if he was kidnapped or mugged or killed by minor criminals.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He brought the device to his ear. \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever talking had been on the other end of the line immediately cut off at his hesitant greeting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim sucked in a breath. <em> Oh. </em> That was Batman. That was <em> Batman\u2019s </em> voice. <em> He was talking to Batman </em>. His heart beat harder in his chest as he barely suppressed the excitement trying to burst out of him. Not only was this a dream come true, this was really the best possible outcome for a situation that easily could\u2019ve ended in various unfortunate ways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He recognized the voice Batman was using as a cross between the one Tim had overheard him using for criminals and the one he used for scared kids. Seeing that he <em> had </em> kind of been a scared kid until a moment ago\u2014a feeling that had quickly been overruled by all-encompassing delight now that he\u2019s discovered who exactly he\u2019s managed to contact\u2014Tim was confident in the knowledge that Batman was going to help him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he opened his mouth again, a little squeak was the only thing that came out. Tim slammed his mouth shut and flushed. <em> He was talking to Batman </em> . It should be fine. He knew Batman both in and out of his suit\u2014a secret that <em> nobody </em> could know\u2014so he shouldn\u2019t be hard to talk to. So why was Tim feeling so\u2026 frozen?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim felt his face growing warmer. Was he\u2026 <em> embarrassed </em> to talk to Batman? Now he was embarrassed that he was embarrassed. Unconsciously, he curled smaller, tucking himself more securely into the cloak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Reeeeal cool, Tim. Your first time meetin\u2019 the big man in person and you\u2019ve gotta act </em> shy <em> ? He ain\u2019t gonna bite and ya know it. </em> He\u2019d never admit it to anyone\u2014it was one of Tim\u2019s biggest secrets\u2014but there were times when Tim pretended he got to have conversations with Robin. Someone to talk to when he was alone, who could give him a pep talk or offer advice. It was only stuff Tim himself could come up with, but pretending that it came from Robin made him feel better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hands fisted tighter in the deceptively smooth fabric of the cloak encompassing him, and he pushed away his ridiculous bashfulness to speak. \u201cI\u2019m lost and I need some help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you get on this channel?\u201d Batman asked in his weird halfway-nice voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Tim could answer, another voice\u2014this one electronically distorted\u2014cut in, \u201cWhere\u2019s Red Robin? Why do you have his comm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Red </em> Robin? That was a weird thing to specify. Everyone knew who Robin was. Tim looked at the rooftops above him, but he couldn\u2019t see anyone. \u201cUm, there\u2019s no one around here. I just found this\u2026 <em> comm </em> with some other clothes. He\u2014I\u2019m, um\u2026\u201d Embarrassment colored Tim\u2019s tone as he mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m not wearing anything,\u201d before rushing on, \u201cand he might\u2019ve left this stuff for me while I was asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim wasn\u2019t sure his face could <em> get </em> any brighter once his next thought hit him. Jason Todd, <em> Robin </em>, had probably found him naked in an alley. Tim would never be able to look him in the eyes again, and Jason wouldn\u2019t even know why.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The comm was silent for a moment until Batman came back to simply say, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll be at your location in two minutes. Tell me if anyone approaches you,\u201d like it wasn\u2019t a big deal that Batman was about to show up to help him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tim said faintly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two minutes. In two minutes he was going to get to see Batman up close. Tim hid his grin in the edge of the cloak. Batman was coming to help him. <em> Personally </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His grin dropped, and he pulled his bottom lip between his teeth to keep it that way. Tim needed to get it together in the next two minutes. He couldn\u2019t be weird and annoying in front of Batman. This was his chance to make a good impression. He had to keep his glee contained.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The telltale rumble of the Batmobile came all too soon for Tim\u2019s now-nervously-pounding heart. Burrowing further into the cloak, Tim peered at the approaching figure of Gotham\u2019s protector. He stopped a few feet away, silent and motionless for a long moment before crouching down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s voice was now completely the one meant for scared kids when he said, \u201cHello there. Can you tell me your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTimothy Drake.\u201d He hated his full first name, but complete information was probably important for Batman\u2019s records.<br><br>The Dark Knight pursed his lips and nodded. He then surprised Tim by greeting, \u201cHi Tim. Could you give me just a moment?\u201d As he turned, Tim felt a smile creep back onto his face. He\u2019d met Mr. Wayne a few times at galas, so he shouldn\u2019t be <em> that </em> surprised that he would remember what Tim preferred to be called, but it was nice to have proof someone had paid attention to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman brought his hand up to his ear, and Tim didn\u2019t hear an echo from his own comm when Batman said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a probable Code Dawn for Red Robin. Stand by at the Cave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Tim asked eagerly, then snapped his mouth shut with a cringe. He\u2019d lasted <em> two seconds </em> at keeping that excitement contained. Whoops. Maybe his mom was right when she told him he needed to work harder at being \u201cpleasant\u201d and \u201cunobtrusive\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yet Batman\u2019s smile wasn\u2019t annoyed at all when he turned back to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that, kiddo. Would you feel okay coming with me? I\u2019ve got to check up on something before I can take you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Relief flooded Tim. He hadn\u2019t botched this too badly <strike>yet</strike> . More time with Batman would be literally the best thing ever\u2014except getting to see either the former or current Robin\u2014so <em> yeah </em> Tim could wait awhile before going back to his big, empty house. Out loud, however, he spoke with an air of formality, \u201cThat should be acceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After bundling Tim into the Batmobile\u2014and wasn\u2019t that another of the coolest things ever\u2014Batman spent some time in the alley using equipment that Tim had no hope of understanding on his own, then bagged the uniform minus the cloak and deposited it in the trunk. Climbing into the Batmobile, Batman gave him another smile. It was way different than the smiles Tim saw him wear at galas, and he\u2019d almost never seen Batman himself smile, so Tim\u2019s chest lit up with warmth. He could almost say the look was\u2026 fond.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shortly after he started driving, though, the questions started.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Tim, I\u2019ve got a couple questions for you. First off, how old are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim briefly considered lying just so Batman wouldn\u2019t question why a kid his age was alone in downtown Gotham in the middle of the night, but realized that the question was probably just a formality. Give him something easy to answer and he\u2019d be more open to answering harder questions. Like what a kid his age was doing alone in downtown Gotham in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ten. And\u2014and a half,\u201d Tim bit the inside of his cheek. Why did he have to be so awkward?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s a good age. Where do you live?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim internally despaired. What happened to spending more time together while Batman \u201cchecked something\u201d? Maybe Batman was sick of him, and he was going to take Tim home first. There wasn\u2019t anything Tim could do to stop him though. Turning his attention to the dashboard, Tim quietly gave the address to Drake Manor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman hummed quietly and commented, \u201cThat\u2019s a long address. Was it hard to learn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe it was because the sting of disappointment was so sharp, or maybe he was just having a weird night, but an annoyed little scoff escaped Tim before he could cut it off. He hated when people thought he might be dumb just because he was young. \u201cMaybe when I was in kindergarten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim regretted back-talking almost instantly, but when he peeked over at Batman, he saw that the Dark Knight had a smirk on full display. \u201cYou\u2019re right; it\u2019s been a few years since then, I guess, so I should\u2019ve figured you would have known it for a while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have one last question for you, Tim, before we get where we\u2019re going. Do you remember why you were out in Gotham tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim opened his mouth. Then closed it. Now that he thought about it, no, no he didn\u2019t. His memory of the night was filled with exactly nothing. And before that, the day was gone, too. Tim sat, still as a statue, as if the memories would appear if he didn\u2019t jostle them away, but his memories failed to solidify.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Tim could work himself into a panic, Batman spoke again, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t. I just need to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim gulped, his throat suddenly dry, and he shook his head, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim?\u201d He waited for Tim to lift his head and see that Batman was now looking right back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. We\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If there was anyone that he could confidently put all of his trust in, it would be Gotham\u2019s resident superhero. He hadn\u2019t started sneaking around Gotham with a camera just because of the cool photos he\u2019d get. Batman and Robin gave Gotham hope and Tim had wanted to capture that before he even knew who they were.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim took a steadying breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman turned his attention back out the windshield. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Tim turned to look too, his heart just about stopped. Laid out before them was what could only be the fabled Batcave. Tim. Was in. The Batcave. He sat frozen, his mouth agape, until the door beside him opened and Batman gestured for him to follow him out. Into. The. <em> Batcave. </em> Tim almost forgot to unbuckle himself in his haste to scramble out of the car.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forget whatever memories he was missing. No moment in his life was <em> ever </em> going to be cooler than <em> this </em> . As long as he got to keep <em> this </em> memory, those other memories could be lost forever for all Tim cared.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tried turning in place to see it all as Batman ushered him across the massive space, but he\u2019d barely taken two steps before he tripped over the cloak pooling around his feet. He would\u2019ve face-planted if Batman hadn\u2019t righted him with steady hands. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were approaching the biggest computer Tim had ever seen when a voice called out, \u201cHey B, is that you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim turned in time to see a figure in dark body armor and a leather jacket limp past a hospital curtain. His green eyes landed first on Batman then made a slow descent until they were fixed on Tim. Neither Tim nor the stranger moved for a long moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then the man burst out laughing, bright and gleeful. Tim\u2019s jaw dropped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Robin?! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hero cut off mid-laugh and froze, smile fixed in place but cracked. <em> Oh crap. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim instantly smacked his cloak-concealed hands over his face and yelped, \u201cI didn\u2019t see! I won\u2019t tell anyone! I didn\u2019t see your face, I promise! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other side of the cave was silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Tim,\u201d Batman placed a hand on Tim\u2019s shoulder and started gently guiding him away, \u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201d There was no way that was true. \u201cHow about we get you into some clothes, how\u2019s that sound?\u201d Probably less embarrassing but that couldn\u2019t fix what had just happened. \u201cI can check something while you do that and then we can talk.\u201d Everything was thoroughly ruined and it was <em> all his fault </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim still had his face buried because his eyes were betraying him and he could <em> not </em> cry in front of Batman. He tried to keep his voice steady as he sniffled, \u201cI really didn\u2019t see. Please\u2014please don\u2019t erase my memories. I promise I don\u2019t know who you are, and I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone ever if I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The statement was so simple, but it had Tim jerking his head up to stare at Batman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe you, Tim. Now let\u2019s get you into some clothes. Hood,\u201d he looked toward <strike>Robin</strike> \u00a0the man <strike> who was definitely Jason Todd even if he was older </strike>, \u201cgo sit down and put ice back on your knee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was led into a locker room and handed a small bundle of clothes while he tried to discreetly wipe at his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake all the time you need and come out when you\u2019re ready,\u201d Batman told him before he left Tim alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim took a moment to compose himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Come on, kid. Nothin\u2019 fell apart. Everything\u2019s okay. Batman ain\u2019t mad at you. He wouldn\u2019t lie. </em> Well, maybe he would lie, but Tim didn\u2019t think so. A smile twitched at the corner of Tim\u2019s mouth. He needed to stop playing Robin in his head when the real Robin was right out in the cave. He could go back out once he was dressed and maybe meet him before he had to leave. It would be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman really <em> didn\u2019t </em> seem mad at him for accidentally seeing Robin without his mask, and he was being very, very nice to Tim. It was\u2026 refreshing. He wanted to have more of that before he was taken home. With that thought in mind, he threw the clothes on as quickly as he could. The clothes were all just a little too big for him, but he didn\u2019t have the time to care.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he scampered back out of the locker room, mood significantly lighter, he saw that Batman was sitting at the big computer, talking quietly\u2014presumably to someone through the comm\u2014and typing periodically. Tim slowed his approach and stopped a couple feet behind where Batman was sitting. His eyes were drawn to a seemingly stationary black and white picture when it appeared on the screen. His instincts told him that he should really hang back and avoid snooping, but his curiosity was burning brightly, so he stayed quiet and snuck closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took Tim a moment to notice that there were lights in the back of the picture that were moving periodically, and a moment longer to identify them as headlights from cars on the street. The camera was pointed steadily at an alleyway and Tim leaned a little closer when he realized that he recognized it. It was a fairly clear shot of the alley in which he had awoken. So far, the alley was empty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t have to wait long before a black shape dropped gracefully into the frame, landing in a crouch and turning quickly. The picture was frustratingly low-quality, but Tim could make out enough to see flickers of movement as they threw things at something out of view of the camera. When the figure flipped backward, Tim perked up slightly, wondering if maybe he was watching Nightwing, but he quickly discarded the idea. Even without color, the costume was all wrong. Regardless, the part of the fight he could see was captivating to watch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim winced in sympathy when the darkly clad fighter dropped the long pole in his hands in favor of clutching his wrist. It took only a moment for him to recover, but in that time, another person had advanced on them from off-camera. Tim squinted at the screen. It looked like the new person\u2014clothes mostly obscured in shadow except for a tall top hat\u2014was shimmering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With no sound, Tim couldn\u2019t tell what they were saying, but it looked like they were talking. Now that he was standing still, Tim got a much better look at the fighter\u2019s costume. Most of the suit looked gray when washed of color by the surveillance camera. There were dark bands crossed over his uniform leading to his head covering of a half-face mask. It actually looked kind of familiar\u2026 Oh! Tim should\u2019ve recognized the cowl from the cloak he had left in the locker room right away. Something settled in Tim\u2019s chest. It <em> hadn\u2019t </em> been Robin that had found him, but this unknown person instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes were drawn to the subtle movement of the fighter\u2019s arm and Tim realized that he was slowly reaching for something on his belt, but before he could enact whatever his plan was, the shadowed figure pulled the top hat from their head and it started to glow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The masked fighter reacted instantly, bursting into motion as he threw something down the alleyway and tried to dodge with a flip. It could\u2019ve looked really cool. <b>A true shame, though, that the magic missile shot him straight on, even as he struggled his hardest to avoid it. Quite rude of the magician, honestly.</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The alley camera whited-out the instant the beam struck and it took a few long seconds for the picture to readjust to the darkness of the alley. When it did, it revealed\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That couldn\u2019t be right. Right there on the screen was Tim\u2019s own crumpled form, wrapped as he had been when he woke up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Tim could question technical glitches and such, Batman turned in his chair. \u201cTim, may I see your wrist?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hands were exceedingly gentle when he took Tim\u2019s forearm in his hand and pulled up the sleeve to reveal the wound that had been there since Tim woke up. While Batman frowned at the gash on Tim\u2019s wrist, Tim\u2019s mind was screeching to a halt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman looked up to study Tim through the eyes of the cowl. At least, Tim thought he was looking at him\u2014it was kind of hard to tell. The dark knight pursed his lips, releasing Tim\u2019s wrist and standing. \u201cCome with me. I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was being led to the curtained area Jason had come from. While they walked, Batman brought a hand up to his ear again. \u201cOracle, Code Dawn confirmed. Update everyone on the situation. And please try to keep everyone out for a bit longer if you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Older Jason was still there, reclined on one of the many beds. He had a plastic bag of ice resting on his knee, and he looked up from a book in his hand when they entered. His eyes found Batman first before taking a long time to move down to him. Tim wasn\u2019t <em> that </em> short, was he?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman ignored him, scooping Tim up under his arms and setting him at the edge of the hospital bed next to Jason\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Batman started, seeming to pick over his words carefully. \u201cYou know Jason Todd here,\u201d he said, gesturing behind him as he reached to pull over a rolling cart with his other hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo!\u201d he protested too quickly, looking away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tim. I know you know me, too,\u201d and then Batman did the last thing Tim expected. He tugged the cowl off his head, revealing the face of Bruce Wayne. Tim\u2019s jaw dropped as he stared into his blue eyes which were filled with a surprising amount of warmth. \u201cBut we look older than you remember, correct?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim felt overwhelmed as he looked between the two of them. Batman and Robin. Bruce Wayne and Jason Todd. Both showing signs of age that hadn\u2019t been there until tonight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thoughts were swirling in Tim\u2019s head, but he finally managed to ask his most important question, \u201cHow do you know what I know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known for many years actually. Because we\u2019ve known <em> you </em> for many years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB,\u201d Jason cut in, \u201cstop being cryptic; you\u2019re gonna freak the kid out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to explain\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBitty bird, we\u2019re older than you recognize because you got shrunk\u2026 somehow. Not important. So you forgot a lot of stuff, like knowing us and all that jazz. Normally, you\u2019re much older than you are right now. Not that much taller though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mr. Wayne didn\u2019t even glance up from cleaning Tim\u2019s wrist when he chastised, \u201cJason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Fine </em>, you\u2019re a perfectly normal height when you\u2019re older. Happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s brain was running a mile a minute as he processed all of that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Tim started hesitantly, trying to settle on a question, \u201che called you Hood earlier, right? Are you not Robin in the future?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst off, this is the present, not the future. And no, I\u2019m not Robin anymore. I haven\u2019t been for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Tim asked with a frown, leaning forward. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing Robin, so why did you stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seeing the cracked look in Jason\u2019s eyes again, Tim regretted asking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mr. Wayne\u2019s hands stilled on the bandages on his arm, and he opened his mouth, probably to intervene.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he could, however, Jason replied, \u201cI grew out of it. And the next person to fill the pixie boots was just as good.\u201d<br><br>Tim frowned deeper, \u201cYou are\u2014were perfect at it. There\u2019s no way the next Robin was better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s smile looked pained, \u201cI used to think that too. But do you know who the next Robin after me was, bitty bird? You.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim felt like his brain was melting. \u201cBut\u2014but\u2014but\u2026 But I have parents!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomehow you made it work,\u201d Jason said, his smirk becoming more natural as he teased Tim.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And wasn\u2019t that just crazy? Jason Todd, now former Robin, was teasing him like this was a normal thing that happened. Maybe it was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A rumbling sound began filling the vast space of the cave and Tim looked around, disconcerted, unsure where it was coming from.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be Dick getting back,\u201d Mr. Wayne said, taping the bandage in place on his wrist and stepping back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m honestly surprised he managed to stay away for this long,\u201d Jason said, fighting to be heard over the roar of the engine as the noise peaked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cacophony of noise cut out as the engine was shut off and they hardly had to wait ten seconds before a black and blue clad figure was bounding into the curtained medbay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did nobody tell me you found\u2014\u201d Nightwing skidded to a halt and froze, presumably taking in Tim. His jaw dropped as he gasped, \u201cOh my gosh he\u2019s so small! B, what can we tell him? Does he know about us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even a few years older, Dick Grayson\u2019s smile was as bright as the day Tim first saw it. \u201cThen Tim, I have a super important question for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim nodded seriously, if a bit apprehensively, \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I give you a hug?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason snorted and put a hand over his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was the first thing Dick wanted to know?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure?\u201d Tim said, feeling more confused by the second.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Dick\u2019s arms came to wrap around him, Tim\u2019s confusion was put right out of his mind in favor of savoring the feeling. His arms felt warm and sturdy and so, so safe that Tim practically melted against Dick\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The crowning moment was when Dick pressed a soft kiss to his hair. If Tim had less self control, he might\u2019ve started bawling then and there. He still kind of wanted to, but instead he closed his eyes and brought his arms around the eldest Robin to squeeze him back like he was probably supposed to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJay, Bruce, he\u2019s the perfect size for hugging! You\u2019ll need to hug him too when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, Big Bird, don\u2019t let Damian hear you say that. They\u2019re about the same size.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turning his head so his face wasn\u2019t so buried in Dick\u2019s chest, Tim asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Damian?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDrake,\u201d a young voice said behind him, sounding offended, \u201cwhat is the meaning of this? Why are you a child?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB, you\u2019re not allowed to yell at me anymore when I call him a demon, because we mentioned him and he <em> appeared </em> . It\u2019s a <em> sign </em>,\u201d Jason insisted, completely ignoring the newcomer\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mr. Wayne gave a long-suffering sigh before ignoring Jason in favor of answering the questions. \u201cTim got hit with a spell that apparently made him young. He doesn\u2019t remember being older than this, so please be nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim began the process of disentangling himself from Dick\u2019s arms in order to face the boy who looked to be about his age. Instead of letting him go fully, Dick set Tim on his lap, holding him comfortably but loosely, allowing him to get up if he wanted. He didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dark haired boy walked forward and stopped right in front of him, looking him over with an assessing eye. His skin was darker than any of theirs, and his eyes were a brilliant green. As those eyes roved over him, Tim felt nervousness grow in his stomach, suddenly worried he was being tested and he was going to fail. What would even happen if that happened? Unless his parents knew he was a\u2026 was a vigilante, he couldn\u2019t go home like this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the boy stuck out his hand, assessment apparently finished as quickly as it had started. \u201cDamian Al Ghul-Wayne. Pleased to make your acquaintance. How old are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m ten and a half.\u201d That earned him a little squeeze from the arms around him and a soft \u2018<em> so little </em>\u2019 from Dick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m older than you. Good to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, Demon Brat. Enjoy it while it lasts\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason,\u201d Mr. Wayne said in a warning tone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Anyway </em>,\u201d Dick cut in, drawing the attention of everyone in the room to himself and subsequently Tim, \u201cit\u2019s pretty late and we should be getting to bed. We can worry about things in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian clicked his tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s already morning. While you two were out looking for Drake, I, left behind for <em> no </em> discernable reason, slept soundly and am now awake for the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the other bed, Jason was looking skeptically at Damian, but kept his thoughts to himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell <em> I\u2019m </em> going to take Timmy with me to bed, and you\u2019re gonna sleep too, B,\u201d Dick said, leaving no room for arguments.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh,\u201d Tim started shyly, not wanting to be rude by correcting him. At Dick\u2019s questioning hum he continued, \u201cI\u2019m not tired at all. I don\u2019t think I could go to sleep now even if I tried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAww,\u201d Dick whined light-heartedly. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to see you when I wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Jason shifted toward the edge of the bed, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll escort Timbit upstairs. You two need to shower and change.\u201d<br><br>Dick and Mr. Wayne both opened their mouths to protest, but Damian beat them, scoffing, \u201cDon\u2019t be preposterous, Todd, you took a pipe to the knee and are lucky your bones are so dense nothing was broken. You are in no shape to escort anyone anywhere. I can handle one child. Come along, Drake.\u201d With that, Damian turned and walked away. Seeing no preferable options, Tim scrambled down to the floor and chased after him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s so <em> cute! </em>\u201d Dick exclaimed quietly as he retreated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, though,\u201d Jason replied, \u201che\u2019s so short I keep looking right over him. Try not to step on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any replies to his warning were lost to Tim as they got too far away to hear. Damian hesitated for a moment when they passed the stairs before leading them into an elevator a short distance away. As soon as the door shut, Damian turned to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you been told about your future? I don\u2019t want to try conversing with you until I know you can keep up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim scowled. What was it Jason called him? Demon Brat? The nickname seemed pretty appropriate, but Tim wasn\u2019t about to say that out loud.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason\u2019s not Robin anymore, and I became Robin after him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian was silent, waiting for him to continue. When he didn\u2019t, he clucked his tongue, \u201cThat\u2019s it? Disgraceful. Come, I\u2019ll tell you more over breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was just past 6am when Tim followed Damian into the kitchen of Wayne Manor. Which was apparently right above the Batcave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Pennyworth,\u201d Damian said politely, nodding to the Waynes\u2019 beloved butler, Alfred Pennyworth, \u201cDrake got himself shrunk, so I\u2019ll be escorting him around today. Drake, you may take a seat over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling, but he was definitely reconsidering a nap with Dick. He seemed like better company.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, Timothy Drake, became Robin after Jason\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Damian, I\u2019m going to stop you there.\u201d Mr. Pennyworth approached them at the kitchen table, two plates of food in hand. \u201cYou would do well to avoid upsetting Master Tim. The broader strokes should be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Damian conceded. \u201cYou became Robin and began spending more of your time here than at your house. I won\u2019t get into too great detail,\u201d he said, glancing past the kitchen island to where Mr. Pennyworth had gone back to work, \u201cbut you came under my father\u2019s guardianship when it became necessary, and later you were adopted into the family. You were still Robin when I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait, <em> what </em>? I\u2014I live here? I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Tim couldn\u2019t continue. His eyes were wide as he stared at Damian across the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you live here some of the time. You also have an apartment in the city. If you ask, I can tell you about your parents, but I would like to avoid upsetting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim took a sip of water from the water glass before him, trying to clear his tight throat before speaking quietly, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 part of your family? Mr. Wayne cared enough to adopt me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damian\u2019s eyes widened and he seemed at a loss for words when the first tear dripped down Tim\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hush now, dear boy,\u201d Mr. Pennyworth said as he came back over, taking the chair to Tim\u2019s left. He gently patted Tim\u2019s back and dabbed at his tears with a handkerchief. \u201cWe all care very much about you. All of the Masters of the house were ready to tear Gotham apart to find you when you went missing during patrol last night. You\u2019ll come to learn that you are very cared for and very, very loved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, like <em> that </em> was going to get him to stop crying. It took an embarrassingly long few minutes for Tim to get control of himself, all the while having his back rubbed soothingly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim gave one last sniffle before giving a watery smile to the old butler, \u201cThank you, Mr. Pennyworth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tutted, shaking his head, \u201cPlease, Master Tim, call me Alfred. And while we\u2019re on the subject, Master Bruce will insist on you calling him Bruce as well. None of this \u201cMr. Wayne\u201d tosh. Now, you boys finish your breakfast. And have a splendid day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A splendid day with his heroes who were also his family. He was sure he could do that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sky was dark once more when Dick turned off the TV in the den late that night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was dozing in a blanket against Dick\u2019s chest when his big brother carefully shifted him into his arms and started for the stairs. He pressed a kiss to Tim\u2019s hair and asked quietly, \u201cHey Timmy, where do you want to sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim lifted a hand out of the blanket to rub at a droopy eye while he considered. Just when Dick was about to decide for him, Tim asked, \u201cCan I sleep in Big Tim\u2019s room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick gave a soft huff of laughter and commented, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to find the bed, but we can try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even holding Tim, he opened the door easily, revealing a cluttered, seemingly disorganized mess inside. He waded through the junk on the floor to deposit Tim softly on a corner of the bed. Tim curled tighter in the blanket as Dick moved around him, clearing space for him to slip under the covers, but Tim was determinedly trying to wake up, remembering that there was something he needed to do before he could sleep. When Tim sat up but made no move to get in the bed when Dick slid the covers down, Dick gave his shoulder a little squeeze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething wrong? Did Timmy fall down the well?\u201d His smile was filled with so much love that Tim thought he would burst for a second.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim returned the smile shyly and shook his head. \u201cI just need to do something before I can go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t stay up too late, though. Little Timmys need their sleep.\u201d Tim reveled in the kiss pressed to his hair, soaking up as much warmth from it as he could before Dick pulled away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHoller if you need anything. Sweet dreams.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Tim called softly as Dick shut the door behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blanket still around his shoulders, Tim climbed carefully off the bed and approached the desk. It only took him a moment to find a notebook with some blank pages that hopefully wouldn\u2019t be missed when he tore them out. He only managed to find a pen amidst the clutter on the desk, but he began writing with it anyway. His mission was too important to worry about such things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was little for now. He couldn\u2019t help them track down a magician or fight crime. But <em> this </em> was something he could do. Just to make sure. Because it suddenly felt like the most important thing in the world to make sure he didn\u2019t forget.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe his older self already knew. Maybe he\u2019d remember being Tim-sized after they fixed him. Or maybe he needed to be reminded. To hear about the things he might be overlooking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Dear Big Tim, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to remember being me-sized, so I wanted to write this to you in case you forget. I got to meet (most) our siblings which was super super cool. Dick went to bed soon after I met him because it was really early morning when we got back to the Batcave, but I wasn\u2019t tired so I went upstairs. Damian (who I learned is Robin now (after us!)) went with us to tell us about being grown up. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Damian kept commenting today on how he\u2019s older than me right now; he seemed to really enjoy it. It only got a little annoying when I was trying to cut up an orange for a snack, and he wouldn\u2019t let me use the knife, so he had to do it. Once I had my orange slices though, he took me around the manor to meet his pets. They were really cute. I didn\u2019t get to meet \u201cBatcow\u201d because </em> <strike> <em> Mr.W </em> </strike> <em> Bruce doesn\u2019t want me going back down to the Cave until his magician friend gets here. Instead, we went to the library and Alfred (the cat) sat on my lap and made me fall asleep. I think Damian must\u2019ve been petting Alfred (the cat) after I fell asleep because he was sleeping against the couch when I woke up. Jason says he took a lot of pictures, so watch out for that. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Jason acts really differently from when he was Robin. He seems lonely. He told me that Alfred is making him stay at the manor while his leg heals, but I don\u2019t think he comes over enough when he doesn\u2019t have to. You should visit him. He seems like a really cool older brother to have. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> The three of us ended up playing Scrabble, which Jason\u2019s really really good at, but I bet you knew that already. He only played one game (which he definitely won), and let me and Damian keep going while he read a book on the couch. He fell asleep after a little while, and Damian took pictures, so you can ask to see those if you don\u2019t remember. Damian called them blackmail, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what blackmail means. It\u2019s just pictures of people sleeping. We do that every day. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Bruce and Dick were awake by the time we had lunch. I got to hear more about the time between me and you, including learning that we go by Red Robin now. I really like the name, by the way. It\u2019s like a combination of Dick\u2019s old name and Jason\u2019s current name, while being uniquely us. I hope the restaurant isn\u2019t mad though. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> At night, Dick let me sit on his lap while we watched a movie. Remember when we did that at the circus the first time we met him? I hope you do. He was really excited to show me </em> Frozen <em> because he said it was a movie you really like, and he wanted me to see it for the first time again. Just between us, I think he might\u2019ve been lying because I thought it was only okay. Sorry if you really like that movie though. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> His hugs are the absolute best. I hope you get a lot of them because I don\u2019t think I could ever get enough. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I didn\u2019t get to meet Barbara (who I learned isn\u2019t Batgirl anymore) or Cassandra (who I really wanted to meet because I\u2019ve always wanted a sister) or Stephanie (who spent time as Robin </em> and <em> Batgirl and I would love to hear the comparison between those two roles). Everybody avoided the topic of why Barbara stopped being Batgirl but they said she still works with Batman. If you could, would you tell her that I thought she was awesome as Batgirl, but I bet what she\u2019s doing now is really good too? And that I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t meet Cassandra or Stephanie? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It\u2019s really nice to know that </em> <em> you </em> <em> we have a big family. I\u2019ve really enjoyed getting to know all of them. Today has me filled up with so much love from all the people in your life showering their love for you on to me. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I decided to write to you to let you know what I got to see today that you might not notice. I\u2019d love it if you already think about these things all the time, but I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of you forgetting that the life you\u2019re living is what I dream about. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I hope you remember to enjoy the feeling of flying on grappling hooks around Gotham. I hope you see your family whenever you want just because you can. I hope you remember to tell them you love them. I hope their love feels like second-nature to you. But I also hope you remember to stop sometimes to really take it in. Don\u2019t take the things in your life for granted. And especially, don\u2019t overlook the little things. </em>\n</p>"
