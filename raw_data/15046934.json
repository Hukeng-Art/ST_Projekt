  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is five the first time he\u2019s saved by a hero.</p>\n<p>He has been quirkless for six months. Really, he\u2019s been quirkless his whole life\u2014most people, like Kacchan, like all the kids in his class, had a quirk laying dormant under their skin, waiting to unfurl, but not Izuku. He never had anything waiting. That part of his DNA was missing. Broken, Kacchan said. Izuku was broken.</p>\n<p>But he hasn\u2019t stopped loving heroes. He lives and breathes heroes, remembers them all, but he\u2019s never seen <em>these</em> heroes before.</p>\n<p>Izuku is walking home from school. He doesn\u2019t hear the heavy thud of the villain landing on asphalt, but he does feel a hand tap him on the head. His feet lift off and he floats into the air. He flails his arms like a bird. Without gravity\u2019s influence, he pinwheels through the air, squealing.</p>\n<p>The sidewalk ices over. Steam wafts off the sheets of ice.</p>\n<p>Izuku flaps his hands and turns in a circle in mid-air. There are a man and a woman standing behind him. The man has two-toned hair and stands tall and regal like some kind of prince. The woman wears a pale pink jumpsuit. She has a nice smile. She waves at him, almost giddy, and Izuku waves back.</p>\n<p>The man commands ice with ease. The woman doesn\u2019t look at whatever has the man so focused, so intense. Instead, she keeps smiling at Izuku like he\u2019s made her whole day.</p>\n<p>Izuku spins himself around again and\u2014</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a giant villain in the middle of the street. Izuku doesn\u2019t recognise him. He knows he\u2019s a villain, because he has a mean snarl and he\u2019s brandishing an even meaner bouquet of knives. The prince-like hero ices him to the ground without moving from his place across the street.</p>\n<p>When the villain is completely trapped, the woman runs over. She says, \u201cRelease!\u201d and Izuku falls out of the air and into her arms. She squeals against his hair. \u201cOh, you\u2019re so cute. And so <em>small</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to scare him,\u201d says the man.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way.\u201d The woman pulls away from the tight hold just enough to look Izuku in the eyes. \u201cI bet he loves hugs. Right? Do you love hugs?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, eyes wide. The woman squeals again and pulls him to her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut him down,\u201d says the man.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous. I bet you want to hug him, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. He\u2019s in shock, he thinks. An awed kind of shock. He just saw two heroes take down a villain he hadn\u2019t even realised was there. They\u2019re here\u2014in person, and not on TV or on YouTube like every other hero fight he\u2019s watched on a loop. The heroes are solid and real, and one of them is hugging Izuku tightly.</p>\n<p>The woman sets him down on the ground and Izuku grabs her hand to stop her from leaving. \u201cCan I have your autographs? You were so awesome. You jumped in there like, Bam! Take this! Ice! And you grabbed me and floated me up like I weighed nothing. Your quirks are so cool, and I love your costumes, and I\u2019ve never seen you before, but\u2014but I\u2019m a fan now\u2014!\u201d</p>\n<p>The two stare at him. Izuku digs into his backpack and grabs his exercise book and a blue marker. He holds both up, and then remembers his manners. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman presses her hand against her cheek. Her eyes are wet. The man looks at Izuku like he\u2019s trying to stop himself from scooping him up and carrying him away.</p>\n<p>Izuku lowers his book. An apology is on the tip of his tongue, but the woman jumps forward and yanks the marker out of his hands in her haste to sign his book. The man signs it with the same intensity he had iced over the villain trying to sneak up on Izuku. He looks faintly constipated.</p>\n<p>Izuku clutches the book to his chest. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you! I want to be a hero too, one day. Even though\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku cuts himself off. In the weeks after he found out he was quirkless, neighbours came up to him and his mum and offered their condolences, like Izuku had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, rather than pronounced quirkless. He had never been popular at school, but the kids inched away from him, as though he smelt funny. And this woman had hugged him and smiled so widely at him\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to see her face drop when she hears that Izuku is quirkless.</p>\n<p>Something strange flickers over their faces. The man looks constipated again. The woman says, choked, \u201cI think you\u2019d make a great hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t lose hope,\u201d says the man.</p>\n<p>Izuku runs all the way home, book pressed to his chest. Mum panics when he tells her about the villain that almost attacked him, and says to walk to school with Kacchan and some of the other kids in the neighbourhood. Izuku promises to, even though Kacchan usually just tells him to get lost when he trails after him.</p>\n<p>Mum also helps him boot up the computer and look up the names of the heroes who saved him. Izuku wants to stock up on their merchandise. Mum would let him. She helps facilitate his love for All Might, and these heroes had personally saved his life, after all.</p>\n<p>With help from Mum, Izuku types in, <em>Floaty hero.</em> Nothing comes up. He tries, <em>Ice hero; pair heroes; two-toned hair; anti-gravity hero; new heroes.</em></p>\n<p>Nothing. Lots of heroes have elemental or gravity quirks, but none of them are the heroes Izuku met today.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re remembering correctly?\u201d Mum asks. \u201cAre you sure they didn\u2019t give their names? What do their autographs say?\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time, Izuku opens up his exercise book. In blue marker, one hero has written:</p>\n<p>\n<em>To my favourite fan,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It was wonderful meeting you. Plus Ultra! You can do it!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku thinks the woman in pink wrote that. The other note must be from the ice hero. It simply says, <em>Stay strong.</em></p>\n<p>It is signed, <em>Your friends.</em></p>\n<p>There are no names.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku knows the two heroes that saved him, even if the world doesn\u2019t. He pulls out his hero journal and draws them beside All Might. Izuku applies the lightest of pressure with a pink pencil to capture the woman\u2019s pastel costume. <em>Floaty Girl,</em> he calls her. She\u2019s his friend, she said so, and it would be rude to keep calling her \u201cthe pink lady.\u201d Floaty Girl is a great hero name.</p>\n<p>He calls the other hero<em> Ice Prince,</em> because he\u2019s prince-like with his quiet seriousness and handsome face. Izuku pays special attention to the Ice Prince\u2019s long hair when he draws him. He makes sure to include the discoloured splotch on his face that Mum says is probably a birthmark or scar when Izuku describes it.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t manage to capture the man\u2019s fine-bonded features no matter how many times he tries. The Ice Prince is much prettier in person. Izuku makes sure to tell Mum that when she looks at his drawings, because for some reason, that seems like an important detail, and she laughs and calls his crush cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a crush,\u201d Izuku says, puffing out his cheeks. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, I understand,\u201d Mum says in a way that makes Izuku think she doesn\u2019t actually understand at all.</p>\n<p>The teacher calls the heroes his<em> imaginary friends</em> when she catches him drawing them in class. Her smile is forced when he tells her that they were real, that they had saved him and said he could be a hero. She nods, just once, and tells him to focus on the classwork rather than his imaginary friends. This time, Izuku doesn\u2019t correct her. He\u2019s getting good at recognising when people stare at him as though they\u2019re looking through him, like he\u2019s a pane of glass.</p>\n<p>That would have been the end of it\u2014Izuku would have continued drawing the cheerful girl and pretty boy until the memory faded and he thought the two heroes really were figments of his imagination\u2014but then, three months later, he meets another\u00a0set of heroes that shouldn\u2019t exist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku sees the villain coming. He\u2019s walking home from the park by himself. None of the other kids wanted to play with him, so he\u2019s going home to watch All Might videos, even though Mum says kids his age shouldn\u2019t spend all day shut up in the dark.</p>\n<p>A hulking villain cracks the footpath under him. His arms are roped with muscle, and his face is twisted up into a snarl, and salvia drips from his pointed teeth. Izuku screams and stumbles back.</p>\n<p>A wave of acid cuts through the footpath between them, eating at the cement. The villain stumbles to his feet, but acid sprays across his back and he howls in pain.</p>\n<p>A hero in silver jumps onto the villain\u2019s shoulders and sends shockwaves of electricity coursing down his back. The villain falls to his knees. Tape wraps around the villain, keeping him immobilised on the ground. Every time he tries to rip through the tape and get back up, another pulse of electricity sends him back down again.</p>\n<p>A woman with pink skin crouches in front of Izuku. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku pushes himself to his feet. One of the other heroes, a man with lemon-coloured hair, says, \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tape hero elbows him in the side. \u201cLanguage, dude. He\u2019s five.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m five and three-quarters,\u201d Izuku corrects.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s very grown up.\u201d Izuku\u2019s shoulders rise up to hide his ears. He knows the acid hero is just trying to be nice. But she waves her hands in the air, and puts on a big, happy smile, and says, \u201cI mean it! That villain is scary and you didn\u2019t cry once. This guy cried the first time he faced a villain and he was fifteen\u2014ten years older than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She points at the electricity hero with her thumb. The tape hero snickers. The electricity hero makes a sound like a seagull\u2019s squawk.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Most of the class cried that time. It was really scary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d says the tape hero, \u201cyou\u2019re really brave, buddy. Brave kids deserve a reward. Is there anything you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>All his journals are at home, along with his markers. It\u2019s a weekend so he doesn\u2019t have his backpack on him and can\u2019t even ask them to sign his school books.</p>\n<p>Instead, Izuku takes a big gulp of air, and says, \u201cDo you\u2014do you want to play with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands with his fists pressed to his sternum and his knees locked straight, the way he stands when he\u2019s saying something big and important to Kacchan even though his heart is pounding and his head feels tight because he knows Kacchan is more likely to blast him backward than to listen.</p>\n<p>The heroes don\u2019t blast him back. They smile. The lemon-haired hero says, \u201cHell yeah, little man.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tape hero fiddles with something on his wrist\u2014like a watch, but smoother and without a clock-face. \u201cLet me send a message to Traverse so he can collect this shi\u2014uh. The bad guy. Take Mi\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The tape hero cuts himself off again. He looks at Izuku and smiles, but it isn\u2019t the easy, happy smiles they\u2019ve been giving him. It looks like it doesn\u2019t fit right on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name, buddy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d says the acid hero.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood save, man,\u201d says the electric hero. \u201cThat could\u2019ve ended badly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Midoriya Izuku. What, uh, what are your names?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Alien Queen,\u201d says the acid hero proudly. Izuku blinks. It doesn\u2019t like a very heroic name. The other heroes look pained.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d says the tape hero, \u201cI\u2019m \u2026 Tape-Man. Yeah. Tape-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>The electric hero is silent for a long moment. They stare at him. Izuku can hear the other kids yelling and laughing from the park a few streets away, and for once, he doesn\u2019t wish he was there with them, even when he hears the soft sounds of explosions and knows that Kacchan is running the Bakugou Hero Agency without him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, come on,\u201d Tape-Man says eventually, cutting through the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is that hard! I\u2019m bad at coming up with things on the spot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about when we had to come up with one\u2014\u201d Alien Queen begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came up with that name years before UA. My brother suggested it.\u201d The electric hero scrubs a hand through his hair, making it stick up in the back. \u201cHow do I come up with another one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about Electro?\u201d Izuku suggests.</p>\n<p>They all turn to look at him. The electric hero\u2014Electro\u2014snorts with laughter. \u201cI think that might actually be a better name than\u2014okay. Sure. Electro it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles. He doesn\u2019t ask why a hero has waited this long to come up with a hero name. Electro said he was bad at coming up with names, after all.</p>\n<p>They leave Tape-Man to watch over the villain. They head into a quiet side-street where they won\u2019t disturb passing cars, and play right there in the street. Izuku doesn\u2019t have his All Might costume with him, but he\u2019s played heroes and villains enough times that he doesn\u2019t need the outfit to be a hero. Alien Queen and Electro pretend to be villains and Izuku chases after them.</p>\n<p>Tape-Man returns sometime later, sans the villain, just as Izuku is scaling Electro like a tree and yelling about restoring justice. Electro is shouting at Alien Queen to help him. Alien Queen is bent over laughing on the other side of the street, refusing to help her partner.</p>\n<p>\u201cTape-Man!\u201d Electro shouts, and then bursts out laughing. He whispers, <em>\u201cTape-Man\u201d</em> to himself, as though the name is the funniest thing he\u2019s heard, before smoothing out his features. \u201cTape-Man, you have to help me defeat this hero!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tape-Man pulls Izuku to his chest. Izuku squeals and tries to flail about in his grip, but Tape-Man launches a rope of tape onto the tall apartment building beside them and they rocket up into the air.</p>\n<p>Izuku clutches at Tape-Man, but he can\u2019t stop beaming. They soar up and over the street until the entire neighbourhood is spread out beneath them. Izuku can see the park Kacchan wouldn\u2019t let him play at. He can see his school crowning over suburban houses. He can see his own street. Maybe Mum is looking out the window and can see him flying through the air. He waves in the direction of his apartment, just in case.</p>\n<p>The heroes can\u2019t stay forever. They each scoop Izuku into a hug before they leave and that, on top of the hours spent playing with him, is worth more than any autograph.</p>\n<p>That night, Izuku sketches the trio in his journal, over and over again until he\u2019s sure he has Alien Queen\u2019s horns just right, and the zigzag of black in Electro\u2019s hair, and Tape-Man\u2019s bulbous elbows.</p>\n<p>He googles the heroes, but, just like Floaty Girl and Ice Prince, he doesn\u2019t find anything. According to the internet, Alien Queen, Tape-Man, and Electro don\u2019t exist.</p>\n<p>Mum frowns when Izuku tells her about the heroes at breakfast. He thinks she might not believe him, but they were real. Izuku remembers the feel of Electro\u2019s leather jacket under his palm. He remembers Alien Queen\u2019s burble of acid eating at the pavement. He remembers Tape-Man\u2019s solid grip around his middle as they soared above the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Even if no one believes him, Izuku knows his heroes are real.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Izuku is six, a truck veers off the road and onto the footpath. It almost hits him, but a man with engines in his legs pulls him clear of a truck. He sets Izuku down gently, and then dives into the truck to grab the woman behind the wheel. He cuffs the woman\u2019s hands behind her back and secures a muzzle around her mouth. Izuku thinks this is extreme, until the hero pulls his hand away from her face and Izuku sees the holes in his gloves. Acid spit.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d The hero has a square face and squarer glasses. He\u2019s so tall that Izuku has to crane his head back to see him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she related to Alien Queen?\u201d Izuku asks. \u201cShe has acid spit, and Alien Queen could shoot acid out of her hands, so maybe they\u2019re cousins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlien Queen?\u201d The man\u2019s mouth thins into a disapproving line. \u201cAh, no. She\u2019s definitely not related to Alien Queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most people screw their faces up when Izuku talks about Alien Queen, but this hero doesn\u2019t. He knows who Alien Queen is. It sounds like he\u2019s met her before.</p>\n<p>Izuku bounces in place. \u201cYou know Alien Queen? Are you friends? Partners? Do you take down villains together?\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero pushes his glasses up his nose. His armour is in bits in pieces, as though he got dressed in the dark and forgot to pull on half the components.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know her, but I can\u2019t talk about her. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026 I can\u2019t tell you that either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku says again. He stops bouncing. \u201cDid you get dressed in the dark?\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero looks down at himself and grimaces. \u201cI got dressed in a hurry. The villain attack caught me by surprise. We\u2019ve been monitoring\u2014nevermind. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero agrees to give Izuku an autograph. He signs it, <em>Your friend,</em> just like Floaty Girl and Ice Prince. He gives Izuku a hug, too. It\u2019s a good hug. The armour digs into Izuku\u2019s stomach and cheek, but the hero is tall and warm and he presses Izuku to his chest as though he\u2019s something precious.</p>\n<p>Izuku is so excited by the run-in with such a great hero that he doesn\u2019t pause to think about the run-away truck or the driver that seemed to aim for him, specifically.</p>\n<p>Izuku sketches the hero when he gets home and jots down details about his quirk. Then, he googles him. It\u2019s beginning to feel like a routine, now.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other times, though, Izuku manages to find a hero that looks just like the man he ran into. Ingenium. A real pro. He\u2019s relatively young; he only graduated from UA two years ago. His armour is a sleek white and black, and his face is square, and his hair blue, but he seems slightly off. Something about him is not quite right. And \u2026 and he has engines in his forearms. Not his legs. His hero agency is several hours away from here.</p>\n<p>Mum frowns at the screen when Izuku shows her. \u201cIt says he stopped a robbery in Tokyo this morning. That\u2019s hours away. He\u2019s too far away to have saved you, Izuku. Are you sure you didn\u2019t mishear the name?\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero hadn\u2019t told Izuku his name.</p>\n<p>Mum is frowning at him again, her brows pinched together in worry. It\u2019s a familiar look. She wears it when he brings up his dream to be a hero.</p>\n<p>Izuku mumbles, \u201cYeah. I must have heard wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is something he\u2019ll have to figure out himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku has his head down and he is focused on putting one foot in front of the other. His ribs aches and his arm stings from his elbow to his fingers. Kacchan had spent the summer increasing the range and force of his explosions, and it shows. Hero training, he had called it. If Kacchan spends next summer furthering his quirk, he may start to do serious damage to Izuku. Permanent damage.</p>\n<p>Izuku stumbles and almost falls. He shoves that thought away. He has to work on getting home. If he thinks about what happened less than an hour ago, he might break down crying again, and the sun is beginning to set. Mum will be worried. He has to get home.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t notice the villains until he bumps right into one.</p>\n<p>The man is easily twice his height. He\u2019s flanked by two others. Strength augmentation quirks, probably. They bear their teeth and flex their arms at him. The street is empty behind him. There\u2019s no one coming to his aid.</p>\n<p>The man to the left eyes Izuku up and down. \u201cYou sure this is him? He doesn\u2019t look like much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the books say he started small. His quirk developed late or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s already all beat up, though. You think he would let people push him around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Izuku says, drawing his arms up against his chest, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money. I\u2019m just trying to get home.\u201d</p>\n<p>They laugh like Izuku has said something funny. Izuku\u2019s instincts are screaming at him to run, but his feet are rooted to the ground.</p>\n<p>He thinks, <em>This is going to hurt so much more than Kacchan\u2019s explosions.</em></p>\n<p>They take a step forward, and Izuku stumbles back and collides with someone else. He whirls around. He was alone a few minutes ago, just him and these three villains in the empty street turned orange by the setting sun, but now there are two more men. One with a smile that shows off his sharp teeth and red hair gelled into spikes, and the other with green grenades strapped to his wrists and a motorbike helmet obscuring his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d says the big villain.</p>\n<p>Grenades launches himself at the group, tackling them to the ground. They skid across the pavement in a sprawl of limbs.</p>\n<p>Grenades works them over with brutal efficiency. His quirk is nasty. Explosions. Bigger than Kacchan\u2019s, even.</p>\n<p>The other man, the red one, crouches down beside Izuku. His smile is kind, even if his teeth are pointy like a shark\u2019s. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Red doesn\u2019t answer. He\u2019s too busy looking Izuku over, expression morphing into something unreadable. \u201cYour arm\u2014your face. What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hides his scorched arm behind his back. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can tell you\u2019re not fine, little man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks back at Grenades. Explosions aren\u2019t a common quirk, but it\u2019s not unheard of. His quirk is so much more powerful than Kacchan\u2019s. It\u2019s frightening and beautiful all at once.</p>\n<p>Why hasn\u2019t he heard of this hero? Izuku assumes he\u2019s a hero, anyway. He\u2019s been cataloguing heroes for years. If he came across a hero with a quirk similar to Kacchan\u2019s, he would have recorded it, and Kacchan would probably go on and on about a hero if they had a quirk like his, loud enough for the entire class to hear, either because it proved his quirk is suited to heroics, or because it would annoy him to have an existing hero out there with a similar quirk. He\u2019d think they were copying him or showing him up, even if Kacchan was born after them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should get that treated,\u201d Red says, trying to peer at Izuku\u2019s injured arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you heroes?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Red freezes. It\u2019s a simple question, isn\u2019t it? Unless these two are vigilantes. That would explain the helmet Grenades is wearing, the one that hides his identity and makes him look a bobble-head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Red says, scratching at the back of his head. \u201cI mean, we will be? I mean. Yes. Yeah. We\u2019re heroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will be?\u201d Izuku echoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said too much, you idiot.\u201d Grenades has finished tying up the villains. His voice is deep and gruff, muffled by the helmet. \u201cWe\u2019re heroes. End of story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis whole thing has me all flustered, dude,\u201d Red says, standing up. He\u2019s tall, almost the same height as Grenades, but some of that might be from his hair. \u201cI mean, look at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades does. Izuku shrinks back. He can\u2019t see Grenades eyes, or even his face, but he can feel his gaze like a physical weight.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Grenades says. It\u2019s not a question. \u201cSomeone did that to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to\u2014you don\u2019t have to worry or anything. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s not\u2014I\u2019m handling everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong,\u201d Grenades says. \u201cHe\u2019s wrong, and one day he\u2019s going to realise that, and he\u2019ll never touch you again. He couldn\u2019t, even if he wanted to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPa\u2014pardon?\u201d Izuku says in a small voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d Grenades says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be so fucking sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said \u2018he\u2019,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cDo you know\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades stalks away, back to the unconscious villains. The setting sun glances off his helmet. He looks strange and dreamlike, bathed in orange light. The entire street looks unreal. Maybe Kacchan shoved him too hard and he hit his head on the way down.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you get home by yourself?\u201d Red asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Red ruffles his hair and even though it jostles the bruise on the back of his head, Izuku leans into the touch. Red\u2019s palm is warm and scratchy. Solid. Real.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet yourself looked at,\u201d Red says. \u201cAnd remember that one day\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Grenades warns in a low rumble.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to be careful? After what you just said?\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades goes quiet, turning his back on them. Red scrunches up his face like he\u2019s thinking hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt gets better,\u201d Red finally settles on. He scrubs his hands through Izuku\u2019s hair again. Izuku closes his eyes, and Red does it again. Izuku wants to stay there all night.</p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes again, Red is watching him with an unreadable expression and Grenades is hovering behind him, his hands clenched into fists. Grenades is staring at him again. Izuku flinches back in surprise. Grenades stumbles away like Izuku is the frightening one.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku says, even though he\u2019s not sure what he has to be sorry for. The line of Grenades body is tense. It hurts to look at.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise,\u201d Grenades says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku says and then realises his mistake. \u201cUh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is kind of painful to watch,\u201d Red says, but he\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku says again. The two heroes stare at him. \u201cOh! I mean\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Grenades says.</p>\n<p>Red nods and heads over to the trussed up villains. His back is broad and textured strangely, faint lines running down his skin like the bark of a tree. Does it have something to do with his quirk? Izuku hadn\u2019t seen his quirk. He wonders why Red is here if Grenades is capable of handling so many villains by himself.</p>\n<p>He casts another glance at Grenades. The stiff posture tells him everything; Grenades is anxious about something. Red, with his kind smile and warm hands scrubbing easily through hair, is there to keep his partner steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Izuku tells Grenades, \u201cfor saving me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Grenades says.</p>\n<p>Izuku wrinkles his nose. No apologies and now no thank yous? Who is this hero?</p>\n<p>Grenades hesitates and then he reaches out, like he\u2019s afraid Izuku will bite his hand off, and ruffles his hair like Red did. His glove is uncomfortable in his curls and he isn\u2019t as gentle as Red, but it\u2019s nice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cwhat are your names? Can I have your autograph?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns around, looking for someplace that might have paper, someone on the street he could borrow a pen from, but there\u2019s no one around. When Izuku turns back around, both heroes and the unconscious villains are gone, as though they\u2019d never been there at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A villain floods the neighbourhood park, half-submerging the bushland. If Izuku was standing upright, the muddy water would only reach his bellybutton, but the villain keeps him down, holds his legs flat against the earth, even as Izuku squirms and claws at her hands. The villain has gills on her neck. She smiles at him when he opens his mouth to scream and only bubbles come out.</p>\n<p>The water is murky and littered with tree-parts and neighbourhood debris\u2014rubbish and spare shoes and long, sharp sticks. Izuku can barely make out the villain\u2019s face through the dirty water. The hero that wrestles him free of the villain is just a blur of green.</p>\n<p>Izuku breaches the surface and sucks in air. His whole body is shaking. If it weren\u2019t for the hero\u2014her tongue, secured around his waist, keeping him steady\u2014he would have toppled back under the water.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright? Ribbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku squints at her through sore eyes. \u201cWhat \u2026 what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA villain attack. You\u2019re safe now, though. My partner is taking care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero is frog-themed. Her costume is designed to match her quirk, assumedly. It\u2019s friendly, the kind of happy yellow and green that Izuku would instinctively trust if he saw her out on patrol. She tilts her head to one side and taps her finger against her mouth, watching him with big eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very cute,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Izuku squeaks and flails back. This time, he does fall back into the water. She hauls him back onto the tree branch easily, and holds him a bit tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not\u2014<em>what?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the same as ever.\u201d She\u2019s smiling. Is she laughing at him? \u201cI like being truthful, and the truth is that you make a cute kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop!\u201d Izuku buries his wet face in his hands. His cheeks are burning. Mum said something about wet hair making you sick\u2014is Izuku already developing a fever?</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d She looks over his shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s almost done. Are you okay, now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, yes. He pushes his wet fringe out of his face. \u201cUm \u2026 Thank you. For saving me, I mean. Can I ask what your name is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFroppy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFroppy!\u201d Izuku bounces in place. The tree branch bounces with him, making the entire tree shake. \u201cThat\u2019s a really cool hero name. Thank you for telling me. Could I get your autograph, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have time,\u201d Froppy says, \u201cbut I\u2019ll give you my autograph one day. Ribbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t quite understand what <em>one day</em> means, but she didn\u2019t tell him no, so he\u2019s happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll done!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku whirls around with such force that he almost falls out of tree, even with Froppy\u2019s support. He can\u2019t breathe. There\u2019s no water in his lungs, no villains near him, but he can\u2019t breathe, because there, wading through the waist-high water, her suit as pink and her smile as bright as he remembers, is\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFloaty Girl.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl stops in the middle of the clearing. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to just stash him somewhere and then leave him.\u201d Froppy gestures at Izuku, but he\u2019s too busy staring at Floaty Girl with stars in his eyes to notice. \u201cHe\u2019s too cute. Ribbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, there,\u201d Floaty Girl says to Izuku in a soft, private tone.</p>\n<p>Izuku presses his hands to his cheeks, suddenly shy. In a small voice, he says, \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d says Froppy. \u201c<em>This</em> is too cute. You\u2019re both too cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to tell beneath her pink visor, but he thinks Floaty Girl is blushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAre you two girlfriends? Or maybe wives?\u201d</p>\n<p>Are they old enough to be married? Married hero pairs aren\u2019t very common, but they exist, like the Water Horse heroes. Izuku has always admired those kinds of heroes.</p>\n<p>Froppy drops him. Water splashes over Izuku\u2019s head and douses his curls once more. Izuku splutters and tries to get his feet under him.</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl helps him stand. Froppy says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Izuku. You surprised me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku takes in Floaty Girl\u2019s deep blush, and says, \u201cI embarrassed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Floaty Girl says. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed. I\u2019m not embarrassed at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku coughs up the water he accidentally swallowed. Once he has his breath back, he jerks upright and points at Froppy. \u201cWait\u2014you called me Izuku!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Froppy says. Floaty Girl is flailing about in the water. Izuku can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s still embarrassed at being called Froppy\u2019s wife or if she\u2019s panicked at this revelation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlien Queen told me your name,\u201d Froppy says. \u201cI recognised your freckles and green hair. Ribbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlien Queen remembers me?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course she does,\u201d Floaty Girl says. \u201cI remember you, too, even if you\u2019ve gotten taller since we first met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>did?\u201d</em> Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl\u2019s smile is as a wide and cheerful as he remembers. It\u2019s like All Might\u2019s smile\u2014it puts something warm and ticklish in his stomach, like he\u2019s swallowed a fistful of flower buds that are now blossoming under his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku jumps at Floaty Girl. She laughs and scoops him up under the arms and spins him around. They\u2019re both wet and their hair drips into their eyes, and Froppy is watching from up above, but Izuku thinks he\u2019s never been this happy in his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are you married to Froppy?\u201d Izuku asks when Floaty Girl puts him down.</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, she turns to Froppy and says, <em>\u201cFroppy?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Froppy says. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t he know our names? We\u2019ll leave soon and it won\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl frowns. \u201cThe others aren\u2019t going to like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s wet fringe drips into his eyes. Floaty Girl pushes it off his forehead. The touch of her hands reminds him of Red. Tears prick at his eyes. He wishes he could see his friends more often.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see us again,\u201d Floaty Girl says. \u201cI know for a fact you will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Izuku asks. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl kneels down in the dirty water and crushes Izuku to her chest. \u201cI just do. Be strong, Izuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hugs back. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku uses his allowance to buy a stack of notebooks and fresh coloured pencils. He dedicates his original notebook, the one with rough sketches from when he met the first nine heroes, as his identification notebook. In here, he writes down dates and names. He draws the heroes who have saved him. With the new coloured pencils, he meticulously colours in their costumes. It takes him several test runs on a spare sheet of printer paper to find the shade that matches his memories.</p>\n<p>The second notebook is his theory notebook. There\u2019s so much to unpack. On the first page, he writes down all the questions he has:</p>\n<p>He will come up with more questions later, he\u2019s sure. For now, he brainstorms rough theories and makes notes.</p>\n<p>After an hour, he flips back to the first page, and adds:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>These heroes don\u2019t have friendly costumes. They don\u2019t have a pretty, almost-delicate face like Ice Prince, or a respectable air like Almost-Ingenium, or a bright smile like Floaty Girl. They\u2019re dressed in dark colours. A living shadow peers at Izuku over the bird hero's shoulder. The taller hero has six arms, some of which sprout eyes and mouthes at the end instead of hands. Neither of them will tell him their names.</p>\n<p>Izuku thinks they\u2019re both incredibly cool.</p>\n<p>Izuku was almost attacked by villains, but he is already brainstorming possible hero names, unfazed by the near-miss. The taller hero could be Dupli-Man, Muscle-Bound, or Shift Hands. The bird hero could be Reaper, Dark Soul, Black Bird, or Raven.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I have your autograph?\u201d Izuku blurts before the villains have hit the ground. He\u2019s not worried about them. These two are capable of handling them.</p>\n<p>Black Bird pauses, even as his shadow preens at the attention. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that is wise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the harm,\u201d says Shift Hands.</p>\n<p>Izuku shoves his notebook at Shift Hands. He looks down at the blank page, pen held in one of his many hands, and then says, \u201cAh. Now I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you given an autograph before?\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Shift Hands says slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe walk a shaded path,\u201d Black Bird says. \u201cOne day the shadows will retreat and you will be beside us, bathed in sunlight, but for now, we must remain a mystery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku glances from Black Bird to Shift Hands. \u201cUh. Pardon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being cryptic to confuse him,\u201d Shift Hand accuses.</p>\n<p>Black Bird sticks his beak into the air. \u201cWe were told not to give anything away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn autograph isn\u2019t giving anything away. Not if we do it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shift Hands seems to think for several moments before finally scribbling something down. He passes the journal to Black Bird, who also signs it. His shadow curves over his shoulder, peeking at the signature, and bursts out into coughing laughter.</p>\n<p>Black Bird hands the journal back. Not every hero agrees to give him their autograph, so Izuku gives them his best toothy smile, so wide it hurts his cheeks, and says, \u201cThank you. And thank you for saving me, heroes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis light,\u201d Black Bird says, \u201cit\u2019s blinding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shift Hands nods solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s the same smile, but it\u2019s also \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo much more. I will cherish this sight for years to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I had a camera,\u201d Shift Hands agrees.</p>\n<p>Izuku cocks his head to one side. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shift Hands ruffles his hair. His broad palms are large enough to span the width of Izuku\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Shift Hands says.</p>\n<p>Izuku opens up his journal to see what their signatures are. It reads: <em>No. 6</em> and <em>the Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come.</em> Somehow, he doubts that this is their real names. Should he keep the names he came up with or should he refer to them as No. 6 and Ghost in his notes? The latter is more accurate, but he was getting attached to Shift Hands and Black Bird.</p>\n<p>He puts his journal back into his bag. He\u2019s not surprised that, when he turns back around, the alley is empty save for bags of rotting garbage and faint blood stains on the brick walls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku recognises the tall silhouettes shadowed by the setting run before they have turned around. It\u2019s not the two-toned hair or the detailed amour\u2014it\u2019s the quiet dignity with which they hold themselves; the slope of their broad shoulders; the way they stand like they will not be moved.</p>\n<p>Izuku should look for villains since his friends only appear when there is danger near, but he can\u2019t take his eyes off them. He runs, backpack thumping nosily with every step, and the two heroes turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Ice Prince. \u201cIt seems we lost track of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe miscalculated,\u201d corrects Almost-Ingenium. \u201cSurveillance usually doesn\u2019t eat up so much time, but we forgot to take into account how unfamiliar with the landscape we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku steadies himself with his hands on his knees. \u201cYou\u2019re <em>here</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be hurrying home,\u201d says Almost-Ingenium.</p>\n<p>Izuku has a dozen questions he wants to ask. All the words try and come out at once and he chokes on the syllables, spluttering up at his heroes.</p>\n<p>Ice Prince drops a hand on his shoulder. It\u2019s hot, like he\u2019s just climbed out of the bath. The warmth seeps into his skin, even through Izuku\u2019s winter uniform.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Ice Prince says.</p>\n<p>Izuku sucks in several rattling breaths under their careful watch. They don\u2019t hurry him or move along to do something more important elsewhere. They\u2019re patient. They\u2019re <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Izuku demands when his breathing evens out.</p>\n<p>\u201cPatrolling,\u201d says Ice Prince.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you patrol here regularly? What hero agency do you work under? Am I going to see you around here again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ice Prince looks to Almost-Ingenium for guidance. Almost-Ingenium says, \u201cThat isn\u2019t information we can give out to civilians.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even tell me where you work?\u201d Izuku narrows his eyes at Ice Prince. \u201cCan you at least tell me your hero name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Almost-Ingenium says. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few of the others already have,\u201d Ice Prince says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. We can\u2019t change that. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can just be reckless\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku is mentally recording everything they say. Pro heroes aren\u2019t secretive, not to fans and the media, unless they\u2019re asked a case-sensitive question, and Izuku only wants to know their names, their agencies, and how to support them. The only way their secrecy might make sense is if they were underground heroes with quirks that made it difficult for them to operate if they were well-known, but neither Ice Prince or Almost-Ingenium look like conventional underground heroes. Neither of their costumes are designed for the dark, and with their marketable styles, they have the potential to be incredibly popular. Agencies would probably encourage them to go public. Plus, their quirks are more suited for daytime activity. Ice Prince\u2019s quirk especially would be difficult to keep secret, given how ice powers are. So why can\u2019t Izuku know something as simple as their names\u2014</p>\n<p>When Izuku looks away from his hands, twisting and untwisting in his uniform shirt, he finds the heroes staring at him with unreadable expressions. If he didn\u2019t know any better, he would say that they almost looked \u2026 fond.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Izuku waves his hands in the air. \u201cI did it again. I\u2019m always getting in trouble with my teachers for mumbling aloud like that. I don\u2019t even realise\u2014I just get stuck in my head and don\u2019t realise. I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Ice Prince says in a flat voice, but he\u2019s smiling, faintly. Flat is his default, Izuku thinks. It makes him seem very cool. Untouchable. Like nothing could bother him. Izuku is jealous. His voice is all wobbly and high-pitched and he mumbles and rambles whenever something strikes his interest. He\u2019ll never be a cool-type hero like Ice Prince.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour curiosity and analytic nature will be valuable when you\u2019re older,\u201d Almost-Ingenium says. Ice Prince glares at him. \u201cWhat? That isn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary to say. Those are both worthwhile traits that anyone in any career would find useful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be getting home,\u201d Ice Price says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be getting dark soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill I see you again?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>The heroes exchange unreadable glances. \u201cYes,\u201d Ice Prince says, \u201cyou will. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hero Journal #10</p>\n<p>They look the same as I remember. <strike>I thought I had been exaggerating how pretty Ice Prince was but he\u2019s still so handsome and I</strike> Their hero costumes haven\u2019t changed either, even if Almost-Ingenium was wearing more of his armour this time around.</p>\n<p>This is further confirmation that the heroes all know one another. How many are there? How do they know one another? Hero agencies don\u2019t normally employ so many pro heroes at once. Are they friends? Did they go to school together? Are they united in a similar cause?</p>\n<p>Why doesn\u2019t anyone else know that they exist?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Deku?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku folds his arms over the desk to hide his sketches, but Kacchan shoves his hands aside and wrestles a sheet of paper free. He holds it up and sneers. Izuku has drawn Ice Prince staring at some point in the distance, the wind tugging through his long hair, flecks of ice creeping up one side of his body. The drawing is in pencil. Izuku was planning on colouring it that afternoon and taping it into his journal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Deku? An imaginary boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>The kids behind him snicker to themselves. Izuku feels very small.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it back!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku makes a grab for the drawing, but Kacchan holds it up even higher and shoves Izuku back down in his seat with one hand.</p>\n<p>Kacchan peers at the other drawings. Alien Queen\u2019s black eyes, and Almost-Ingenium\u2019s armour, and Black Bird\u2019s billowing cape is just visible, poking out beneath Izuku\u2019s arms. Kacchan wrestles free the drawing of Alien Queen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a hero,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name, then?\u201d Kacchan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlien Queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan stares at him for a long moment, something twisted up about his expression, before he shoves at Izuku\u2019s desk. Its skids back, the metal feet scraping loudly against the floor, and Izuku is shoved back with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cHow do you know her, then? There\u2019s no pro hero called Alien Queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2014she\u2019s a hero. She\u2019s a hero and she\u2019s my frie\u2014friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPathetic,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cFucking pathetic. No one wants to be around you, so you have to invent imaginary friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not imaginary,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah? You going to introduce me to your friends, Deku?\u201d</p>\n<p>Even if he wanted to, Izuku doesn\u2019t think he could. They never stick around for long. They\u2019re not his friends in the way that Kacchan was his friend, playing together on the weekend, and walking to and from school, and sharing everything from lunches to All Might action figures. No one else knows that they exist.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s shoulders slump. Kacchan laughs, and it\u2019s a rough sound, a mean sound, and makes their classmates, watching from neighbouring desks, laugh with him.</p>\n<p>Kacchan looks down at the drawing of Ice Prince again, considering it, before ripping it in half, and then quarters, and then in eighths. He throws the pieces over Izuku. When Izuku starts crying, Kacchan rolls his eyes and stalks back to his own desk. He shoves the drawing of Alien Queen into his uniform pocket.</p>\n<p>That night, Izuku tries to tape the drawing back together, but it doesn\u2019t look right. He gives up and throws the pieces in the bin. He never gets the drawing of Alien Queen back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He meets Invisible Girl and Ninja Warrior next, which leads to Izuku barricading himself in his room and theorising all weekend about heroes working in pairs vs in teams vs individually.</p>\n<p>Ninja Warrior distracts and baits the fighter-type villain before Invisible Girl pounces on him from behind. The villain goes down hard. Invisible Girl cheers and, assumedly, throws her hands into the air. Ninja Warrior smiles, looks to his right, and freezes upon seeing Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew what we were getting into,\u201d Ninja Warrior says slowly, \u201cbut \u2026 holy shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Invisible Girl follows his line of sight, spots Izuku, and squeals. Izuku jumps back in fright.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s so CUTE!\u201d She skips forward. From the bouncing of her gloves, he assumes she\u2019s jumping up and down. \u201cHey, how old are you, sweetheart? You must still be a few years off from UA!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUA?\u201d Izuku repeats.</p>\n<p>The bouncing stops. \u201cHigh school in general, I mean. We went to UA, so it\u2019s easy to forget other schools exist. Why, do you want to go to UA?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something in her tone that makes him think he\u2019s missing something. These two attended UA. Did the others attend UA, too? If only UA\u2019s information was available to the public, then he could go digging and find their real names.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone wants to go to UA,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cbut their admission-rate is so low. I\u2019d be impossible to get in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Invisible Girl says and then laughs like she\u2019s said something funny.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t know he\u2019s quirkless. The realisation is like a jolt of ice through his stomach. Izuku doesn\u2019t tell people if he can help it. People in his life will always find out\u2014at school, you\u2019re asked what your quirk is right after your name, and Izuku is kind of infamous for being quirkless.</p>\n<p>None of the heroes have asked his quirk yet. Izuku won\u2019t volunteer that information on his own.</p>\n<p>Ninja Warrior frowns, his tail thumping at the asphalt like the foot of a rabbit. A nervous tick. Invisible Girl notices Ninja Warrior\u2019s silence and elbows him in the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust \u2026 \u201d Ninja Warrior looks at Izuku. There\u2019s something twisted up about his expression\u2014something almost amused, almost fond, but pained, too. Like looking at Izuku hurts him. \u201cWere you always this small?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tense pause and then Invisible Girl laughs again. This isn\u2019t the easy, feminine laughter of before; this is a manic sound, this side of too sharp. \u201cYou hit your head back there, honey. All kids are small, remember? You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ninja Warrior says, shaking his head. \u201cRight. Kids are small, and then they grow up, and they\u2019re not small and they can handle themselves. They turn into scary teenagers or adults that no one can touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Izuku asks slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in some strange, stressful situations lately,\u201d Ninja Warrior says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope everything works out,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet, but we have to be going,\u201d Invisible Girl says.</p>\n<p>She tussles his hair and then tugs Ninja Warrior back down the street. Why do heroes keep ruffling his hair? What is it about him that draws mysterious heroes to him and then compels him to save him and mess with his hair in equal measures?</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you later, honey,\u201d Invisible Girl shouts over her shoulder, Ninja Warrior stumbling over his feet to keep up with her. They disappear around a corner. Izuku gives chase, but when he rounds the corner, he finds a wide, empty street. Neither hero is in sight.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The heroes that save him every few months should be famous. They\u2019re the kind of heroes that people should sit up and notice. But no one else knows who they are.</p>\n<p>Izuku has dozens of theories, some more plausible than others. Currently, his top five working theories are:</p>\n<p>He scraps each theory almost immediately.\u00a0His friends feel solid and real when they pull him out of danger; when they scoop him up and carry him to safety; when they crush him to their chest in a desperate hug before dropping him, as though shocked by their own actions, as though remembering they\u2019re hugging a strange quirkless child rather than a loved one. Izuku can\u2019t believe that his heroes are anything other than real.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The van jerks as it barrels over a speed-bump. Izuku is thrown against the hard edge of the door.</p>\n<p>The other person in the back of the van, a man in a fox mask, laughs at Izuku\u2019s frantic, winded inhales. Izuku\u2019s hands are tied behind his back, but he manages to get his feet under him and push himself upright. Fox laughs even harder when he sees blood drip down Izuku\u2019s temples and into his lashes. His whole face feels wet with blood, and tears, and spit that leaks down his chin from the coarse rope stuffed in his mouth.</p>\n<p>Fox reaches for him. Izuku flinches back, but there\u2019s nowhere to go. A hand claps down on his shoulder, keeping him in place. Fingers drag over the wound on his head. Fox holds them up, examining the red sheen of his fingertips, before sliding his fingers into his own mouth and sucking.</p>\n<p>Izuku starts crying. He wants to be strong, but he\u2019s so scared.</p>\n<p>Fox grins around his fingers. \u201cYou taste so sweet. I always knew you would.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku curls up against the door. He imagines Floaty Girl tapping the van and making it fly up into the air so all the bad guys slide right out the door, away from him. He thinks about Black Bird descending on the van like a bat. His shadow would smash through the window and pull Izuku to safety. He thinks about Alien Queen melting the door clear off its hinges so Izuku could scramble out and run for safety.</p>\n<p>He thinks about All Might. He wants All Might to be here, to let him know it\u2019s alright. He would rip the door off and pull Izuku into his strong arms. He would be smiling, even as he knocked the villains out with a single punch. Then he would pull the ropes off and carry Izuku all the way home to Mum\u2014</p>\n<p>Mum. She must be so worried.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Fox coos. He pulls his fingers out of his mouth. They\u2019re spit-shiny. All trace of Izuku\u2019s blood is gone. Swallowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, little bunny? Where\u2019s that big, bright smile? Where\u2019s your bounce? Not so \u2018can do\u2019 anymore, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The van slows and then stops, but the engines keeps vibrating beneath them. They must be idling at a red light. Izuku pushes himself up and lunges for the cloth blacking out the windows. If he can signal to a passing car, then they can call the heroes\u2014</p>\n<p>Fox catches him by the hood and yanks him back. Izuku chokes. Fox\u2019s arms wrap around his middle. Izuku can feel his hot breath ghosting against the back of his neck. Fox says something, something terrible, but Izuku is deafened by his own heartbeat.</p>\n<p>He thinks the shout and thump from the front seat are hallucinations, at first, but then the engine switches off. The front doors open and slam closed.</p>\n<p>Fox doesn\u2019t notice, but Izuku does. Are they not at a red light? Have they arrived at their destination?</p>\n<p>The back door is ripped open. Fox jumps to his feet.</p>\n<p>A man with purple, slicked-back hair glowers up at them. \u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d Fox cuts off mid-sentence, clapping a hand against his mouth, but it\u2019s too late. His eyes glaze over. His shoulders slump, all the fight drained out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet go of him and exit the van,\u201d says the purple-haired hero.</p>\n<p>Fox drops Izuku and stands. His face is blank. He robotically climbs out of the van. The hero sweeps Fox\u2019s feet out from under him and restrains him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d says the hero. Fox closes his eyes against the asphalt and dozes off. The man approaches the van slowly, hands open. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks at him with wide eyes. He makes a muffled sound behind his gag.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit. Right.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man pulls out a pocket-knife and climbs into the van. Izuku forces himself to hold still when the man crouches down in front of him and takes hold of his jaw so he can cut the gag free. He severs the ropes around Izuku\u2019s arm and legs before stepping back out of his personal space.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was mind control,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>The hero won\u2019t look at him. \u201cYes. It was. I won\u2019t use it on you, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>The hero blinks at him, almost surprised, though Izuku doesn\u2019t know why. He saved him. Izuku is still reeling from the aftereffect of panic, but he\u2019s already picked out a name for this hero: The Operator.</p>\n<p>The Operator gives Izuku a piggy-back ride home. When prompted, he talks about his quirk and the design elements of his costume. He doesn\u2019t comment on how violently Izuku is shaking. He even asks questions about how Izuku is doing at school and manages to sound genuinely interested rather than politely detached, unlike most of the adults Izuku meets.</p>\n<p>\u201cVillains try and attack me all the time,\u201d Izuku says into the Operator\u2019s high collar, \u201cbut it\u2019s never been this bad. None of the villains have managed to actually grab me before.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Operator\u2019s hands tighten and then slacken around Izuku\u2019s knees. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have gotten there sooner. And I should have kept a better watch on those villains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You came. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d A thought occurs to Izuku suddenly. \u201cHey, Operator? You know the others, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He snorts. \u201cOperator?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m naming you, since you aren\u2019t going to tell me your real hero name, right? You don\u2019t seem like the type to reveal that.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long pause. Izuku\u2019s vision is blurry. They pass a park and the cluster of trees swim together into one wet, leafy blob. Izuku closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of the others didn\u2019t tell me their names either,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been making up names for them, too. Do you think they\u2019d mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I hear the names you\u2019ve come up with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. There\u2019s Floaty Girl, Ice Prince, Red, Grenades, Shift Hands, Black Bird, Invisible Girl, and Ninja Warrior.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my god.\u201d The Operator sounds delighted, like Izuku has personally handed him a gift. \u201cNinja Warrior. <em>Ice Prince.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really went with Invisible Girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a girl and she\u2019s invisible. I couldn\u2019t be bothered being very creative that day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither could she, apparently,\u201d mumbles the Operator.</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t know what to make of that, so he continues, \u201cAnd now you\u2019re the Operator.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you decide on \u2018Operator?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you control people, kind of like the way olden day telephone operators controlled phone calls. We watched a documentary about old technology in class a few weeks ago. I considered naming you \u2018the Puppeteer\u2019 but that sounds menacing and you\u2019re not menacing. You\u2019re a hero. Heroes should sound cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>If fear hadn\u2019t left him feeling so burnt out, and his head didn\u2019t throb with every step, Izuku would probably be using this opportunity to pry the hero for information. But Izuku is content with curling up against the warm, well-armoured back and enjoying the attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Midoriya?\u201d Izuku hums to show he\u2019s listening. He\u2019s too out of it to question how the Operator knows his name, even though Izuku hadn\u2019t introduced himself. \u201cI\u2019m glad I met you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes slip shut. \u201cI\u2019m glad I met you, too. Hey, can I have your autograph?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Operator laughs. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sleeps through the rest of the walk. He doesn\u2019t even wake when the Operator brings him home and wards off Mum\u2019s frantic worrying. When Izuku wakes the next morning, Mum sweeps him up into a hug, and plants careful kisses along his tender forehead, and cries into his hair. Izuku clutches at her and finally breaks down.</p>\n<p>When they finally pull apart, Mum sets about making an extra large breakfast. She lets him have the day off school to recover.</p>\n<p>As she bustles around the kitchen, Mum gushes about the kind, handsome hero that rescued him. Izuku chokes on his glass of water.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew they were real!\u201d</p>\n<p>Mum turns to look at him, spatula in hand. \u201cIzuku?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy heroes. The heroes who keep rescuing me\u2014I knew other people could see them, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you talking about the Ice King?\u201d Mum asks. \u201cYour imaginary friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head. \u201cNo. Mum, these heroes that keep rescuing me\u2014they aren\u2019t imaginary. The hero yesterday proves it. I bet if we googled him, he wouldn\u2019t have any results.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mum turns off the stove. She\u2019s taking him seriously, now. \u201cWhat did he say his name was, again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said\u2014\u201d Izuku falters. \u201cUh. He didn\u2019t say, actually. I named him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mum stares at him. Izuku pushes his plate away and feels, suddenly, very tired.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s one of those underground heroes?\u201d Mum says gently, like she\u2019s trying not to hurt his feelings. \u201cThey usually aren\u2019t very public. And you did have a head wound, honey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>After breakfast, after Izuku inches towards to Mum until she notices his embarrassed expression and sweeps him up into another hug and gently pats his hair until he feels better, he tracks down his notebook. It\u2019s on the desk. He doesn\u2019t remember leaving it on the desk.</p>\n<p>He flips open to the last used page. There\u2019s an autograph. A new autograph.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Thank you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014 The Operator</em>\n</p>\n<p>What is the Operator thanking <em>Izuku</em> for?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t say it out loud, but these dozen or so heroes are his friends. His only friends. School is a lesson in isolation, but Izuku can duck into a bathroom stall and open up his notebook and see drawings of his friends, see their smiling faces reminding him to never give up hope, and be reminded that he\u2019s not alone, even if it\u2019s been months since he last saw them. Sometimes it\u2019s less than a week between meetings. Sometimes it\u2019s half a year.</p>\n<p>After these long absences, he\u2019s always relieved to see them again, and only then, when they\u2019re in front of him, does he admit that he was scared that they would disappear out of his life forever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku never had a royalty phase. Kacchan had one, though. When they were three, Kacchan wore a plastic crown and a matching cotton cape for six months straight. King Hero, he would call himself, which morphed into King Explosion Hero when his quirk manifested. Izuku thinks he was attracted to kingship mostly because he liked the idea of power. Izuku had never understood it, even when he was three years old and Kacchan was declaring that Izuku was the weak princess that they all had to save. It was heroes or nothing for Izuku.</p>\n<p>The hero before him swishes his cape dramatically. His polished armour and glittery cape glint in the sunlight. It hurts Izuku\u2019s eyes to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cA prince has arrived to save you,\u201d says the hero.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>He goes around the sparkly hero in a wide arch, staying clear out of arms reach. The hero splutters and jogs after him. Izuku walks even faster.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait! There are villains looking for you. Stay here so I can rescue you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stops. He turns around, eyeing the hero. \u201cWhy are villains after me, a quirkless eleven year old?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku knows full well that villains would be after him. Not that some random street performer will know that.</p>\n<p>The hero tilts his head like a bird. \u201cPardon? Did you say you\u2019re quirkless?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku scoffs and keeps walking. This probably isn\u2019t a hero. This is probably one of those street performers that dress up like heroes and use their flashy quirks to amuse crowds, only to get moved along by mall security\u2014or, in harsher cases, arrested for public quirk usage.</p>\n<p>The wannabe hero is still following him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any money,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMon bon monsieur, I do not want your money.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero keeps pace with him for several blocks. Izuku grits his teeth and goes over a map of the neighbourhood in his head. He\u2019s run through these streets enough times as a kid. If he broke into a sprint, he could probably find one of his hiding places before the old guy caught up with him. Kacchan hasn\u2019t sniffed out half of his hiding places, and Izuku thinks Kacchan is much stronger then this stranger foreigner in a glittery cape.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen who are you?\u201d Izuku asks as he scans the street. The people they pass barely spare them a second glance.</p>\n<p>The man looks delighted to have been asked. He draws up his cape and strikes a pose. \u201cI am Prince Charming, the hero who cannot stop twinkling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Izuku says doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you not dazzled?</p>\n<p>His hiding spot isn\u2019t for another few streets, but he decides that Prince Charming probably isn\u2019t much of a threat. He could throw his backpack full of heavy books at him if he tried anything funny.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Izuku begins, turning around, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want, but I\u2019m not worth following around like this. I don\u2019t have any money or friends and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile drops off Prince Charming\u2019s face. He grabs Izuku around the shoulders before Izuku can reach for his backpack and hauls him down the street, right before a fireball scorches the pathway, right where Izuku had been standing.</p>\n<p>A villain wreathed in flames steps out of a side alley. His entire outfit is made of studded leather and pointed spikes, and eyeliner is crusted beneath his eyes.</p>\n<p>Prince Charming scoffs. \u201cYou are as tacky as ever, mon cher.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks Prince Charming up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re calling him tacky? That\u2019s kind of hypocritical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Prince Charming ignores him. He keeps Izuku behind him while the leather-bound villain attacks with bursts of flames, returning fire with a sparkly beam from his stomach. Izuku ducks behind a sidewall and watches on.</p>\n<p>Prince Charming isn\u2019t anything like the Ice Prince, but he\u2019s definitely a real hero. He takes down the flame villain like it\u2019s nothing. He maintains a smile the entire time.</p>\n<p>Izuku takes back everything he thought about Prince Charming before. He\u2019s not Izuku\u2019s preferred hero, but he\u2019s a pro. A pro with a theme. A sparkly, royal theme. Izuku can respect that.</p>\n<p>When the villain is knocked out by an especially bright beam of light, Prince Charming flips his long hair back and waves Izuku over.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I have your autograph?\u201d Izuku asks, pulling out his hero journal.</p>\n<p>Prince Charming\u2019s smile is so wide it seems almost dorky. He bounces on the heels of his silvery boots.</p>\n<p>\u201cMon cher ami, yes! I am honoured. Do not even thank me, it was my pleasure to save you on this lovely Spring afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes the notebook from Izuku and signs it with a flourish. When he hands it back, Izuku squints at the page.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Merci pour tout, mon ami.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Take care.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2727 Prince Charming \u2727</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t speak French,\u201d Izuku says, studying the words, trying to piece them together. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p>\n<p>When he looks back up, Prince Charming and the flame villain are gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t surprised when Google yields no results. There are plenty of results for prince charming, but nothing about the blond hero in a sparkly cape. Google translate is much more helpful.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Merci pour tout, mon ami.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Thank you for everything, my friend.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku chews at his fingertips and stares at the screen. What does it mean?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku loves almost every hero he comes across, both online and in person. Every quirk is so amazing and he burns up on the inside with jealousy. Some quirks, though, are undeniably cooler than others.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Izuku echoes, jumping in place. \u201cYou can really make <em>anything?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The woman smiles at him. She\u2019s very pretty. \u201cAnything within reason. My fat cells are transformed into different matter, and it\u2019s an exhausting process.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cis so cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>She refuses to give him a name. Izuku doesn\u2019t mind. He knows some of the heroes just aren\u2019t okay with it.</p>\n<p>Izuku spends the rest of the week coming up with a name for her. He almost chooses Creation or Production (Production the Producing Pro Hero sounds too much like a tongue twister). In the end, he settles on <em>Genesis</em>. An appropriately cool name for such an amazing hero.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour quirk is cool,\u201d Izuku says around his straw, \u201cbut I found someone who\u2019s quirk is cooler.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Operator snorts. \u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t say electricity or ice-and-fire. Or worse: explosions. I couldn\u2019t stand that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku narrows his eyes. \u201cHow do you know about those specific quirks?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Operator sips at his bubble tea. He\u2019s quiet as he takes a long drink, before saying, too casually, \u201cJust an example. I dislike flashy, offensive-type quirks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you like All Might and his quirk, right?\u201d Izuku puts his drink down. \u201cYou have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Operator laughs for some reason. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I think a hero with a quirk similar to All Might would be very strong, so long as they have the heart. And they do. They have that heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Would be an amazing hero?\u2019 All Might is an amazing hero. Present tense.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Operator smacks his lips together. They\u2019re faintly blue from his blueberry tea. \u201cDid I mention Japanese isn\u2019t my first language? Tenses are difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo who is this person with the cool quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku watches the Operator for another long minute. This conversation is full of lies. He\u2019s not upset\u2014a lot of his conversations with these mystery heroes consist of lies and half-truths\u2014but he is hoping that one day they\u2019ll slip and reveal something crucial. Or else they\u2019ll cave in the face of Izuku\u2019s determined stare.</p>\n<p>But the Operator doesn\u2019t flinch. If anything, his smile gets wider and wider the longer Izuku stares at him. He seems to enjoy Izuku\u2019s frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cI met a hero with a creation quirk,\u201d Izuku finally says, after a solid minute of staring into the Operator\u2019s unblinking eyes. How did he learn to keep his eyes open for so long?</p>\n<p>The Operator laughs. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable losing to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHer,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYou said her. So you do know the other heroes. Do you know all each other, is that it? Do you work together? You have to. Or else you\u2019re all in communication with one another.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little brat,\u201d says the Operator fondly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not going to spill anything. Tell me about this amazing quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe quirk that you know?\u201d Izuku says. \u201cThe quirk attached to the person you\u2019re acquainted with?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Operator has that unblinking stare fixed on him again, and Izuku sighs. \u201cFine. I called her Genesis. Her quirk is <em>fantastic</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Operator visits, sometimes. He\u2019s frustrating. Izuku has been running into strange heroes for almost seven years, but he hasn\u2019t received many answers. He wants answers.</p>\n<p>He has\u00a0to try something new. He\u2019s tried it to the Izuku-way for years. He needs to try it the Bakugou Katsuki way, just once, just to see if he can spook information out of the strange heroes that save him.</p>\n<p>A hero in a banana-yellow suit punches a villain through a brick wall and then bodily carries Izuku to safety. Izuku doesn\u2019t let himself get overwhelmed by the All Might-like display of strength. He has a mission.</p>\n<p>The hero, hastily dubbed Yellow Might, puts him down and ruffles his hair. When he turns to go without a word goodbye, Izuku pounces. He wedges a foot under the man\u2019s leg and uses it to lever himself up enough to wrap his arms around Yellow Might\u2019s neck and cling like a koala. Yellow Might squawks and tries to pull him off, but Izuku clutches at him even tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Izuku shouts into his ear. \u201cI need answers. Why do villains keep coming after me? Why do strange heroes keep saving me? Why is it me and not someone else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yellow Might gets a fistful of Izuku\u2019s sweater and hauls him off his back. He sets Izuku gently down on the asphalt, his hand still resting on Izuku\u2019s shoulder, and there\u2019s something about his eyes in that moment, something soft and familiar, that makes Izuku think, <em>This is it. I\u2019m finally going to get the answers I\u2019ve been searching for for years.</em></p>\n<p>But then Yellow Might yanks his hand back like Izuku is a feral animal who is going to bite it off and sprints as fast as he can in the opposite direction, scooping up the unconscious villain as he goes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou coward!\u201d Izuku yells after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older,\u201d Yellow Might calls over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Izuku has had enough of being treated like a kid. He runs after Yellow Might, but by the time he has caught up, both Yellow Might and the villain have gone. He isn\u2019t surprised. He\u2019s barely disappointed.</p>\n<p>Izuku snaps a photo of the man-shaped hole in the brick wall with his crappy camera phone and then runs home to sketch Yellow Might while his memory is still fresh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prince Charming accidentally destroys a public bench and knifes through a cluster of trees with his glittery lasers. Burnt cherry blossoms flutter in the air. The ground is scorched were the bench once was.</p>\n<p>Prince Charming\u2019s smile never wavers, but Izuku can see that he\u2019s sweating. He adjusts his sunglasses and says, in English, \u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs. \u201cYou sound like All Might! He swears in English, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is rubbing off on me, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku leaps forward and seizes a handful of purple cape. Prince Charming flinches back instinctively, but Izuku\u2019s grip keeps him from getting far. This is the first time any of these heroes have mentioned All Might. He cannot let him go without a fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met All Might?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d Prince Charming is sweating even more, now. \u201cI just\u2014I see him on TV, no? Everyone sees him on TV at this moment in time. I am \u2026 influenced by his media presence. Yes, that\u2019s it. I have never met him in person, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku lets go of the cape. He can\u2019t hide his disappointment. A part of him had been hoping that All Might was apart of this whole thing for years. It didn\u2019t make any sense, but any chance to interact personally with All Might was a chance Izuku would seize with both hands.</p>\n<p>But that makes sense. People are influenced by All Might all the time without having met him. Like Izuku. Like Kacchan, who started swearing regularly in both English and Japanese a long time ago, partially because of the frequency in which All Might swore, and partially because he likes the way people\u2019s faces twist up when they hear him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not look so sad, petit lapin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku scuffs the grass with his sneakers. \u201cWant to go for milkshakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcusez-moi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want milkshakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2026 okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku leads them to a small cafe. They garner a few stares, but people are so used to minor heroes, street performers, and cosplayers that they don\u2019t question Prince Charming\u2019s presence on the streets. Maybe his costume is so flashy that it detracts attention; people assume the gaudy cape, armour, and sunglasses cannot be anything but a performer, rather than an actual hero.</p>\n<p>Prince Charming buys them milkshakes and they sit by the window. Prince Charming struggles more than the other heroes had when just spending time with Izuku with no villain in sight. He keeps opening his mouth to say something and then cutting himself off with a wheeze.</p>\n<p>Izuku fidgets with his straw. \u201cHey, Prince?\u201d</p>\n<p>Prince Charming looks up from where he is making shapes in his whipped cream. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Prince Charming looks offended. \u201cYes, of course! You thought we weren\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shrugs. \u201cI thought we were, but you\u2019re not around much\u2014you or the other heroes. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lonely, Izuku almost says. Isolating. It plays tricks on the mind. When the heroes are gone, and it\u2019s just Izuku again, he begins to second-guess everything.</p>\n<p>Prince Charming reaches across the table and places his hand on Izuku\u2019s. His smile is a little strained, like he\u2019s not sure what to do with his face, but Izuku can hear how hard he\u2019s trying through his words. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. I promise, we\u2019re friends. Sometimes, remembering this makes me feel better on bad days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemembering me?\u201d Izuku asks in a small voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Remembering that I have the honour of being your friend, and the friend of the others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Prince Charming is the gaudiest hero. He catches the light like a disco ball, blinding onlookers, and he strikes poses, and reapplies lip gloss after each fight, but the way he looks now, squashed into a vinyl booth across from Izuku, reaching out for Izuku\u2019s hands, fumbling for the words to tell Izuku that he\u2019s honoured to have friends\u2014it makes him seem humble, almost.</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles shyly back at him. \u201cMe, too. When I\u2019m sad, I pull out drawings of you all, and it makes me feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou drew us?\u201d Prince Charming asks. \u201cYou have drawn me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku snatches his hand back. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must show me these drawings!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNo!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still drawing those fucking imaginary friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to hide his journal behind his back, but Kacchan is stronger and faster and wrestles it away from him easily. At least he\u2019ll be quick, Izuku thinks. They\u2019re a few streets away from school, and the morning bell will ring in another fifteen minutes or so. Kacchan wouldn\u2019t risk being tardy, not even for the chance to mess with Izuku.</p>\n<p>Kacchan flicks through the journal with an upturned lip. Izuku can\u2019t see how this will end with anything other than a destroyed journal, and he has to bite down on his lip to stop from crying, because he\u2019s put so much work into this journal. It\u2019s almost full. There are so many good notes about his friends in there.</p>\n<p>Izuku opens his mouth to try and reason with him, even though he knows it\u2019s probably useless. \u201cKacchan, give it\u2014give it back. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? You going to fucking cry if I don\u2019t? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still wasting your time on this childish bullshit\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan cuts himself off. The journal is open to a random page\u2014a sketch of Red from the last time Izuku had run into him. He sees Red every so often\u2014not as often as Floaty Girl, Almost-Ingenium, or Ice Prince, who are the most frequent heroes, or even the Operator, who\u2019s made several reappearances since he first showed up, but it\u2019s not uncommon to see his sharp, friendly smile.</p>\n<p>Kacchan grabs his shirt and hauls him close. Izuku has to go up on his tip toes to stay grounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the fuck is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWh\u2014what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan shakes the journal. \u201cThis hero\u2014who are they? How do you know them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend, like all the others,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe others?\u201d Kacchan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe other heroes. The ones that saved me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour imaginary friends,\u201d Kacchan corrects.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not imaginary. They\u2019re real. They saved me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan glowers at him. There\u2019s something about his expression, about the way he\u2019s searching Izuku\u2019s face for some hint of a lie, that makes something in Izuku\u2019s chest unclench. Right now, Kacchan seems different. Less cruel.</p>\n<p>Kacchan thumbs through the journal, sneering. \u201cHow many of these freaks are in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t need to think about it. He keeps a tally and he adds to it after every new encounter. \u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeventeen,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cAre you bullshitting me right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan flicks back through the journal, his lip upturned. Izuku almost wants to ask him to be more gentle with his journal, but he thinks that might just encourage Kacchan to blow it up.</p>\n<p>Kacchan purses his lips like he\u2019s sucked on a lemon. He shoves the journal back at Izuku. \u201cWhatever. Fucking lame, shitty Deku. We\u2019re in middle school and you still have imaginary friends? Fucking hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stalks off, hands shoved in his pockets. There are still five minutes until the morning bell will ring. Izuku clutches at his journal and stares after Kacchan, amazed that his journal is still in one piece.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a boy pinned under a villain\u2019s hand. The villain is a hulking metal exoskeleton. The boy is crying. Leaves stick in\u00a0the boy's dark curls, and dirt is smudged over his freckles and down his ripped school uniform.</p>\n<p>There is no one else on the street. No one here to save him.</p>\n<p>Izuku picks up a fallen tree branch and mimics Kacchan\u2019s war cry. It cracks and sounds deranged rather than frightening, but it makes the villain turn away from the boy and settle those glowing eyes on Izuku.</p>\n<p>Izuku thinks it\u2019s worked, but then the boy kicks out and tries to squirm out of the villain\u2019s grip. The villain curls a hand around the boy\u2019s throat, and the boy chokes and splutters as he fails to draw in air. Izuku is running before he\u2019s consciously made the decision to get between them. He pulls back, swings, and smacks the branch agains the metal back. The impact ricochets up his arm and into his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says the villain, voice ringing hollowly. \u201cI got it wrong. There you are, little hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy sobs around the fat metal fingers. Izuku\u2019s knees are trembling, but he keeps himself upright through sheer force of will, holding onto his branch even though he knows it would do nothing against the villain\u2019s metal plating.</p>\n<p>The villain eyes the branch. \u201cWhat were you planning on doing, hm? You\u2019re only a child right now. Maybe you\u2019re almost in high school, but they say you developed late. Heroes are nothing until UA beats them into shape.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d Izuku manages to say through chattering teeth. \u201cI just\u2014I\u2014you were hurting him. I won\u2019t let you hurt him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me? I had though you might be different at this age, but you\u2019re exactly the same.\u201d The villain laughs and shakes the kid in his grip. Both Izuku and the kid cry out.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cPl\u2014please. Let him go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it so wrong. And to think, I almost killed what\u2019s probably going to be some unimportant salaryman and then <em>left</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hefts his branch onto his shoulder, but before he can swing again, he\u2019s tackled to the ground. A woman in a leather jacket and dangly ears glares at the villain over Izuku\u2019s head. \u201cDid you just run out at a villain, kid? Is that what I saw? Jesus Christ. You\u2019re the worst. Apparently, you\u2019ve always been the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Izuku says, before he shakes his head to clear it. \u201cThat boy\u2014you have to help him. Please!\u201d</p>\n<p>When Izuku turns his head, he sees another person. When had he gotten there? He\u2019s covered in small animals\u2014birds and cats and little mammals with sharp teeth. A lion crouches behind him. Its teeth are bared. Izuku squeaks like a mouse and clutches at the woman\u2019s leather jacket.</p>\n<p>The animal-type hero waves at him with a smile. Weakly, Izuku waves back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the kid,\u201d says the earphone hero. \u201cYou go stand behind my friend. He doesn\u2019t bite. Neither do his animals. The lion is as soft as he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>She confiscates Izuku\u2019s tree branch and hurls it off to one side.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>She points a finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about interfering, got it? You\u2019re, like, what? Nine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThirteen,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThirteen,\u201d she says. \u201cChrist. Okay, scram. Let my friend take care of you. And do not, for the love of fuck, try and fight this villain when you\u2019re thirteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks up at her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorts like Izuku has said something funny. \u201cYeah, sure. Go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The heroes take care of the villain easily, though Izuku is a little disappointed that he didn\u2019t get to see the lion in action. He got to pat it, though. It was like a large kitten, butting up against Izuku\u2019s chest, wrapping itself around Izuku, long tail flicking his neck. (It isn\u2019t until the heroes are gone, that Izuku wonders if the lion was there solely to provide rescue support. It seemed awfully fond of Izuku for reasons he can\u2019t quite understand.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Izuku says before they leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you thanking me for saving you or for saving the other kid?\u201d asks Earphone.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cBoth, I think. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorts. \u201cJust sounds like something you\u2019d do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Animal-Man says something in sign language that makes Earphone laugh again. Izuku tips his head to one side, and she translates, \u201cNo self-preservation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks up at them. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNevermind,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you around. Stay out of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d They turn back around. Izuku offers out his journal. \u201cCan I have your autographs?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh.\u201d Izuku fiddles with the buttons of his uniform. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exciting, Izuku,\u201d Floaty Girl says. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFourteen,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl and Ice Prince exchange unreadable glances. Izuku is used that. His friends often have silent conversations over his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting grown up.\u201d Floaty Girl sounds wistful, almost. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fifteen soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ice Prince elbows her. \u201cFifteen does typically come after fourteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she says, rubbing at her side, \u201cthat you\u2019ll be in high school soon. That\u2019s a big step. Are you nervous?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku chews on his lip. He looks at his shoes rather than at his friends, and nods, just the once.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat. Then, Floaty Girl snatches up his hands and pulls him along the street. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a present, but we need to celebrate your birthday somehow! Come on, we\u2019ll buy you lunch. It is around lunchtime, isn\u2019t it? What do you feel like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ice Prince waits with the tied-up villains while Floaty Girl leads them deeper into the city. People stare as she passes, but Izuku is used to turning heads when he\u2019s with his friends. It used to drive him crazy when he was younger\u2014people can\u2019t help but stare at his friends, so why don\u2019t more people know about them as heroes? Anyone can tell at a glance that they\u2019re amazing. Their faces should be plastered on every flat surface.</p>\n<p>They get lunch at a nearby take-away restaurant. Floaty Girl\u2019s burger is the size of her head. When Ice Prince meets back up with them, he only orders a vanilla milkshake.</p>\n<p>They eat in the park near Izuku\u2019s house, cross-legged on a grassy clearing. Izuku chews on his burger and palms at the dirt with his free hand. It\u2019s dry. He remembers being held under floodwaters here. He remembers the burn of his lungs; the muddy sludge that had stuck to his clothes; the stick that carved a bloody line on his calf when he waded through the water by Froppy and Floaty Girl\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>Izuku lowers his burger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t gotten older,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl stiffens. Ice Prince puts down his milkshake.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2026\u201d she begins, and then stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not going to tell me anything,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYou never do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl puts a hand on Izuku\u2019s curls. He peeks up at her. She seems so apologetic, so hurt by Izuku\u2019s disappointment, and he realises that maybe they don\u2019t want to keep secrets from him. They\u2019re not being mean. They\u2019re not the type.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d Ice Prince says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d Floaty Girl agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not because\u2014we would tell you, if we could.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Ice Prince says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Floaty Girl says with that terrible hurt expression, so different from her bubbly smile, \u201cwe can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku drops his burger. Floaty Girl reaches for it, trying to stop it from being ruined by the dirt, but Izuku seizes her wrist. He has both of their attention, now. He\u2019s surprised by his own boldness. The words are climbing up his throat, and he needs to say this\u2014they need to know this.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cThank you for always saving me. Thank you for being there. Thank you for being my friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Floaty Girl says. \u201cOh, Izuku \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank us,\u201d Ice Prince says.</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head so hard his curls bounce around his cheeks. \u201cNo, I want to! You deserve to be thanked. So, uh. Thank you. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl lunges forward and drags him into a hug. It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve hugged. It\u2019s not even the second.</p>\n<p>Izuku is taller now. Not as tall as her, no where near as tall as Ice Prince or the others, like Yellow Might, but he\u2019s taller than he had been when they first met almost ten years ago. Izuku is different, but Floaty Girl feels the same. She\u2019s warm, and her jumpsuit is padded with armour, and she smells of ozone and vanilla perfume. She\u2019s a good hugger. He wonders who taught her to hug like that\u2014fiercely, like every hug is her last.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre there any more of you?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many have you met?\u201d Floaty Girl asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNineteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no more. That\u2019s everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ice Prince hugs him when they leave. He\u2019s the same, too. He\u2019s two-temperatures, and smells faintly of smoke, and his hands are strong and long-fingered, like a piano player. He\u2019s very pretty. Izuku has trouble looking at him, sometimes. His face feels hot when he does.</p>\n<p>They wave goodbye to Izuku. He stands on the corner of the park and watches them go until they turn a corner and disappear. If he were to chase after them, to turn that same corner, he knows he would see an empty street. Neither of them would be in sight, as if they had never been there at all.</p>\n<p>When he gets home, he writes sparse notes in his journal. They didn\u2019t reveal much today, but every detail counts.</p>\n<p>Nineteen heroes in total, Floaty Girl had said. Nineteen. What an odd number. Twenty he could understand\u2014twenty would make sense. Twenty is class. But nineteen feels incomplete.</p>\n<p>Izuku closes his eyes tight and pretends that he\u2019s the missing piece. He shuts out visions of his middle school, with looming classmates and walls that start to close in when Izuku\u2019s chest feels tight. He doesn\u2019t think about Kacchan. He doesn\u2019t even think about All Might.</p>\n<p>He thinks about his nineteen friends. Today was the first time he spent a birthday with his friends since he was little and Mum had drafted invitations to all the kids in his pre-school class. That sunlight clearing in the local park should belong to a dream, but it was real; Izuku still remembers the tangy taste of the burger\u2019s sauce, and the feel of grass under his hand, and the warmth of his friends dragging him into a hug.</p>\n<p>He thinks about being the last puzzle piece to complete the mystery. He thinks about being the missing member of a group of twenty, rather than nineteen. He thinks about his friends knocking on the door and announcing that they\u2019ll stay. That they\u2019re not going to disappear again. That they think Izuku is worth sticking around for.</p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes again, the vision fizzles out into nothing. His cheeks are wet. He scrubs at his face and glowers at the journal, open to a drawing of Genesis and Earphone from the last time they teamed up to save him from a villain, but he can\u2019t bring himself to close it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been dreaming of his friends since he was five years old. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that he misses them so fiercely, that this ache in his chest has never gone away. It never will go away, he thinks. Not until his friends stay with him. Not that they ever will, though.</p>\n<p>Izuku is used to having impossible dreams; he can live with one more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku hasn\u2019t seen his friends in a while.</p>\n<p>He saw them during the holidays. They had seemed different. The way they looked at them, the way they spoke to him\u2014it had been <em>different</em>. They always seemed a little off\u2014there was something about them that he couldn\u2019t put his finger on\u2014but during the summer before his last year of middle school, that impression grew until Izuku had felt like there was something obvious that he was missing.</p>\n<p>School has only been back a few weeks, but already, his teachers have started to talk about high school. Izuku misses his friends. Maybe they would listen, and understand, and not laugh when Izuku confesses that he wants to go to UA. They wouldn\u2019t get that flint-eyed smile their teacher wears when Izuku submits his preferences to UA, like he thinks Iuzku is a particularly small and amusing bug that\u2019s bashed itself on his window. They wouldn\u2019t crowd around him and snarl like Kacchan.</p>\n<p>Kacchan has been getting twitchy now that high school applications are coming up. He\u2019s determined to make something of himself, just like Izuku, but sometimes Kacchan doesn\u2019t think.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014take a swan dive off the roof!</em>\n</p>\n<p>What would have happened if Izuku actually had? What would have happened to Kacchan\u2019s dream, then?</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his journal again. Water splatters onto his sneakers. He stares at the little wet marks, and he can\u2019t help but wonder if his childhood friends would be waiting for him up on the roof if Izuku were to wind his way up there. That\u2019s a kind of rescue, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>Or maybe they would be waiting for him at the bottom. Maybe Ice Prince would freeze him to the building; or maybe Tape-Man would pluck him out of the air half way down; or maybe Shift Hands would be waiting at the bottom to catch him.</p>\n<p>At least then, if they did show up, Izuku could talk to them again.</p>\n<p>Izuku shoves that thought out his head. It doesn\u2019t matter what they would or would not do, because he\u2019s not going up to the roof. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s going home.</p>\n<p>Most students have gone home for the day, but Izuku still takes a back-route so he won\u2019t run into Kacchan or his friends again. He rounds the corner, and realises that the school isn\u2019t as abandoned as he thought; there\u2019s someone lounging at the back of the school, leant up against the brick wall as if he belongs there.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a villain?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Grenades tips his head to one side, considering. He\u2019s still wearing a motorbike helmet. Izuku has never seen him without it, and he sometimes wonders if Grenades has a scar or disfigurement, or if there is something about his quirk that prevents him from baring his face to the world, like the centuries-old hero Izuku read about years ago. Scott Summers, Izuku recalls. Maybe Grenades\u2019s quirk is like Scott Summers?</p>\n<p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d Grenades says.</p>\n<p>Izuku squints at him suspiciously. \u201cWhat are you doing here, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades snorts. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten confident. Hope we didn\u2019t change too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku presses the still-dripping hero journal to his chest. He can still feel the phantom touch of Kacchan\u2019s scorching fingers on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not confident. Not at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Grenades corrects. \u201cI\u2019m here to keep the others off your back. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll show up, but, well. I don\u2019t want to risk it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you said there weren\u2019t any villains around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about villains,\u201d Grenades says. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the others. The heroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re \u2026 stopping the heroes from coming?\u201d Izuku is suddenly aware that he doesn\u2019t know Grenades as well as the others. He has never even seen his face. Izuku reaches for his backpack. It\u2019s not much, but he could throw it at Grenades and make a run for it if he had to.</p>\n<p>A laugh scrapes its way up Grenades throat.\u201cCalm down, brat. I\u2019m a hero. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant that you\u2019re going to be on your own today,\u201d Grenades says. \u201cThe others are\u2014they\u2019re busy. Okay? They\u2019re busy. So you\u2019re going to be on your own today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look busy,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cand you said you were stopping the others from coming to see me, not that they couldn\u2019t come in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades shakes his head. He mumbles something that sounds a lot like, <em>\u201cYou little shit\u201d</em> under his breath, and then crouches down in front of Izuku and lays his hands on Izuku\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fourteen, too old to be treated like a toddler, but Izuku goes lax under his touch anyway, and lets Grenade\u2019s gentle hold replace the phantom feel of Kacchan\u2019s hands exploding against his body.<br>\u201cI know this is confusing,\u201d Grenades says. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Along with Red, Grenades was one of the first heroes that Izuku met, but he\u2019s always seemed distant, like he doesn\u2019t want to get close to Izuku. Or, maybe, like he doesn\u2019t know how to.</p>\n<p>But Grenades has been popping in and out of his life since he was six. If he wanted to hurt Izuku, he could have done it during those long eight years. Izuku isn\u2019t a little kid, anyway. He can fight back, now. Kind of.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Grenades nods. \u201cThen believe me when I say the heroes can\u2019t come today. I can\u2019t explain, but \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku says, and pulls on a smile. He can\u2019t see his face, but he can tell from the line of his body that Grenades is stressed. Worried. \u201cDo you want to go get milkshakes? I\u2019ll pay. I have some of my allowance money left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Grenade says. \u201cI\u2019m leaving soon. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying, brat? You\u2019re on your own today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades doesn\u2019t sound mean as he turns down Izuku\u2019s offer; he sounds urgent, almost.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, okay, then. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades lets go off his shoulders and steps back. \u201cGo home, Izuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grenades watches him go until Izuku turns the corner and heads out of sight. Izuku stares at the ground and tries to piece together what that conversation had meant.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the heroes will drop by without the threat of a villain attack looming over their heads. Izuku thinks that they do regular patrols or, maybe, they come by just to spend time with him. Maybe they\u2019re doing both at once. It\u2019s hard to tell. They never fully answer his questions when he asks.</p>\n<p>But the heroes are often gone for months at a time. Izuku hasn\u2019t seem them since the holidays. He hadn\u2019t expected to see them today. So why did Grenades come to his school just to tell him that he wasn\u2019t going to get a visit from anyone else today?</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t notice the villain, until slime is wrapping around his legs. It climbs up to his chest, and then his mouth and nose. Slime slips between his teeth. He can\u2019t see the villain\u2019s face, but he can hear his mean laughter.</p>\n<p>Izuku can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t scream for help. He claws at the slime, trying to pry himself loose, but there is nothing solid to hold onto.</p>\n<p><em>The heroes can\u2019t come,</em> Grenades had said. <em>You\u2019re on your own today.</em></p>\n<p>For the first time in his life, Izuku is left at the mercy of a villain. He chokes and reaches out with one arm like he\u2019s trying to pull someone in being.</p>\n<p>His friends have always come when he was in danger. Villains are rarely able to touch him. But now, his vision is blurring out, and there\u2019s slime under his tongue. It\u2019s in his throat. In his lungs.</p>\n<p>His friends aren\u2019t coming. Maybe they\u2019re never coming again. Maybe they\u2019ve abandoned him. Maybe\u2014</p>\n<p>Izuku passes out as a loud, familiar laugh echoes down the tunnel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, Izuku wonders if All Might is a part of his group of heroes. Does All Might know his friends?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something about All Might that reminds him of his childhood friends. Izuku doesn\u2019t know what it is that gives him that feeling, until steam billows out in a thick cloud and All Might shrinks, and Izuku realises\u2014he has a secret. This is why he reminds him of his friends: he is trying to hide something from Izuku. It\u2019s a different kind of secret, but a secret nonetheless.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t told his friends that he was quirkless\u2014he could never bare to bring it up\u2014but he tells All Might.</p>\n<p>When All Might tells him no, he wishes he hadn\u2019t. He wishes he had stayed behind the shaded gymnasium with Grenades, had sat down in the dirt next to his boots, even if Grenades hadn\u2019t wanted him around. Anything would have been better than this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kacchan is trapped in the villain\u2019s vicious body. His mouth is covered, but his eyes\u2014his eyes are screaming out for help.</p>\n<p>Izuku waits, frozen on the wrong side of the crowd, but none of his friends appear. Then he remembers: they\u2019re not going to appear. Not today.</p>\n<p>The heroes that are here aren\u2019t doing anything. Their quirks are incompatible with the villain, so they\u2019re just hovering there, watching on while Kacchan silently screams for help.</p>\n<p>For the second time that day, Izuku realises his friends aren\u2019t coming to save him from this villain. He\u2019s alone. Kacchan\u2019s alone.</p>\n<p>His legs move on their own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might corners him on the street turned orange by the setting sun and offers him his quirk. After that day, Izuku is caught up in training, and studying for entrance exams, and talking with All Might\u2014<em>All Might\u2014</em>like he\u2019s a normal person instead of the man who helped shaped society into what it is today. A month passes, then two, then six. One day, Izuku wakes up and realises he hasn\u2019t seen his childhood friends in almost a year.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Normally, by the time All Might makes it to the beach, Izuku is already busy straining to drag junk four times his size through the sand. Today, though, he\u2019s running late.</p>\n<p>All Might stares up at the trash pile as though he expects Izuku to come hurdling over the garbage. Izuku leaps over the half-wall separating the beach from the street and sprints across the sand. His whole face is probably flushed from running all the way there.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku gasps out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d All Might says. \u201cYou weren\u2019t that late, just try and be more punctual next time.\u201d Izuku dumps his backpack and rolls up his sleeves. All Might hesitates before adding, \u201cCan I ask why you were late, though? Are you struggling to stay on top of your schoolwork\u2014I probably wouldn\u2019t be much help with homework, since it\u2019s been so long since I was in school myself, but if you need extra time to dedicate yourself to your studies, we could look at your schedule and rearrange some things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not schoolwork. It\u2019s a personal project, I guess.\u201d Izuku drops the rubber tire he had picked up, and wipes his hands on his pants. \u201cActually, can I ask you a few questions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku rifles through his backpack until he finds his well-loved notebook. He flips through it until he finds the right page and opens it up so All Might can see.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Floaty Girl\u2014or, well, I call her Floaty Girl. I don\u2019t actually know her name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flips to another page. \u201cThis is Ice Prince. Again, I don\u2019t actually know his name? But Ice Prince seems to fit him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku continues like that, flicking through the pages with reverence, and introduces All Might to his nineteen friends. When they reach the end, Izuku holds his journal to his chest and peeks up at All Might, suddenly shy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you recognise any of them? Have you \u2026 have you met them before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d All Might says, \u201cbut no, I don\u2019t know them. Except this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes Izuku\u2019s book and flips back to Almost-Ingenium. This tells Izuku nothing. If he were to ask a stranger on the street to flip through his journal, they would probably pass over every one of his friends aside from Almost-Ingenium, the only half-recognisable hero in the group.</p>\n<p>\u201cIngenium,\u201d All Might says. \u201cHe\u2019s a hero in Hosu City. I met him once or twice before, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not him, though.\u201d Izuku points at the legs. \u201cIngenium has engines in his arms, while this hero, this Almost-Ingenium, has engines in his legs. Plus, his armour is slightly different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHero costumes change over the years,\u201d All Might says. \u201cA hero\u2019s suit may look very different ten years down the road. Are you sure that this person you encountered had engines in their legs? Maybe you made a mistake. Memories can be tricky things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a mistake,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet. Stranger danger and all that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t read it online.\u201d Izuku takes his book back. \u201cThanks, anyway, All Might. It was a reach to think that I could answer all my questions at once by asking someone else after all these years of researching. It was stupid of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku had known All Might probably wouldn\u2019t be able to tell him anything. None of his friends had admitted to having a connection with All Might\u2014though Izuku knew that he couldn\u2019t trust everything that they told him\u2014and it wouldn\u2019t make sense for nineteen heroes that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t believe exists to be closely related to All Might, the Symbol of Peace, one of the most recognisable celebrities in Japan, if not the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung Midoriya,\u201d All Might says.</p>\n<p>Izuku dredges up a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been trying to find these heroes since I was little. No one else knows that they exist. I shouldn\u2019t have put pressure on you to know them, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might squints out at the trash pile, haloed by the sinking afternoon sun. \u201cHeroes that the rest of the world are unaware of? That does sound familiar, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not underground heroes,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cMost of their quirks aren\u2019t even suited for that kind of work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d All Might says, \u201cthat\u2019s not what I meant. When I younger, well before I joined UA, I ran into a group of heroes that no one else knew existed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku perks up. \u201cReally? What were they like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never saw their faces,\u201d All Might says. \u201cThey wore matching jumpsuits and helmets that covered their faces and necks\u2014dark coloured and nondescript. I almost thought they were villains trying to rob me, at first, but no. They took down a few villains and then ran out of there before I had a chance to talk to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHelmets?\u201d Izuku flips his journal open and holds up the picture of Grenades. \u201cOne of my heroes wears a bike helmet!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bike helmet. It was more like a proper hero\u2019s helmet, something made by a support agency, but there was nothing else I could use to identify them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you ever find out who they were?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d All Might says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t underground heroes. I asked around. I always thought that maybe they worked for some kind of \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCovert operation?\u201d Izuku suggests. All Might nods, yes. Izuku sighs and puts his journal away. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that for my heroes, at least. They're too noticeable to be chosen for secret missions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d All Might says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku says again.</p>\n<p>All Might must feel bad about not being able to help. He lays a large hand on Izuku\u2019s curls, and says awkwardly, \u201cThe thing I said about stranger danger is still important. Don\u2019t give out personal details about your life or meet up with someone you met online. You don\u2019t actually know who they are\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs. \u201cThanks, Dad. I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both stiffen. Izuku can feel heat his cheeks heat up. It might be a trick of the light, but he thinks All Might flushes pink, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I had better get training,\u201d Izuku chokes out, waving his hands around so fiercely that he almost smacks All Might in the stomach. \u201cI was late, and there\u2019s only so much time! Yup. Training. Plus ultra.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku ducks under All Might\u2019s arm and sprints up the side of the garbage pile, making a bee-line for the rotting pot-plants at the very top. If Izuku hadn\u2019t run off, he might have seen All Might staring at his hand, forgetting about Izuku\u2019s battered notebook as he instead memorised the phantom feel of Izuku\u2019s coarse curls against his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is so worked up about the entrance exam that he almost misses her. He <em>would</em> have missed her if she hadn\u2019t tapped him before he fell face-first into the sidewalk. The feeling of weightlessness and the accompanying rush of excitement is the same as when he was five years old. She\u2019s almost the same, too\u2014bubbly smile, and flushed cheeks, and bouncy brown hair. Her face is rounder and her hair is shorter than he remembers, but it\u2019s her. It\u2019s her. Floaty Girl.</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl if she was a teenager.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>Izuku chokes on his own tongue. He\u2019s too overwhelmed to get out anything coherent before she\u2019s wishing him luck and skipping away.</p>\n<p>Izuku walks into the auditorium and finds his assigned seat in a daze, barley registering Kacchan grinding his teeth in the seat beside his. His thoughts are a mess.</p>\n<p>How is this possible? He had always thought Floaty Girl was an adult. She had definitely been an adult the last time he saw her. Even if she had been a young teenager when she first saved him, almost ten years has passed since then and the girl who stopped his fall looked as though she was Izuku\u2019s age. If she looks somewhere around fourteen to sixteen now, then she would have to have been roughly five years olds when he first met her, and she definitely <em>hadn\u2019t been\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Floaty Girl must have a younger sister or cousin. That\u2019s the only explanation that makes sense. Siblings often look alike and have similar quirks. It would also explain why the girl didn\u2019t recognise him.</p>\n<p>Should he track down the girl with the anti-gravity quirk? Would it be too invasive to ask about her older sister\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou there!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s head snaps up. The auditorium is silent. A tall boy in glasses is glaring at him over rows and rows of seats. Izuku chokes on his spit.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Is that Almost-Ingenium?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Okay. New theory. None of this is real and Izuku has begun to hallucinate from the stress of it all. He\u2019s probably face-down somewhere in the street and only imagined heading out to take the entrance exam. Did All Might\u2019s hair do this to him?</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s head hurts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl\u2019s sister and the boy that yelled at him are both at the same testing area as Izuku. He tries to edge around the crowd of students to talk to her, but the tall boy seeks him out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t disrupt exam goers!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares up at the boy while he lectures him. He\u2019s tall. His blue hair is neat and well-groomed. He has a square jaw, and glasses, and engines in his legs, and Izuku definitely knows this boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost-Ingenium?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy stops. \u201cExcuse me? Ingenium is my older brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Older brother. Of course, this boy is also Izuku\u2019s age, and so he cannot be the person that first rushed Izuku to safety all those years ago. Except\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cIngenium has engines in his arms,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>The boy gives him a strange look. \u201cYes, quirks often mutate slightly as they are passed from parent to child, and so it\u2019s rare for siblings to have identical quirks. But we aren\u2019t here to discuss my family. You should stop attempting to distract everyone around you. You may not take this seriously, but the rest of us\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Present Mic cuts through Almost-Almost-Ingenium\u2019s lecture. The test begins abruptly, while Izuku is still staring up at the boy in dazed horror, trying to slot together decade-old puzzle pieces.</p>\n<p>Izuku runs blindly into the testing arena. He can\u2019t blow this. All Might is counting on him. He can\u2019t get distracted\u2014</p>\n<p>Prince Charming is here.</p>\n<p>Like Almost-Almost-Ingenium and Floaty Girl\u2019s sister, he is Izuku\u2019s age. His hair is shorter and instead of a billowing cape, he\u2019s wearing a tracksuit, but the\u00a0navel beam and french accent are unmistakable. The teenager even winks at Izuku, the same way Prince Charming used to wink at him when he was younger.</p>\n<p>Three young versions of his childhood heroes have appeared within the space of a few hours. What does this mean?</p>\n<p>Izuku flails in the middle of the chaotic exam. He\u2019s too worked up. His hands are getting all cold and sweaty, and there\u2019s not enough air, and his brain won\u2019t shut up\u2014</p>\n<p>A towering robot thunders down the street. All the other students turn tail and run. Izuku spots Floaty Girl\u2019s sister trapped beneath rubble, struggling to free herself.</p>\n<p>His mind blanks out. His feet move on their own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the weeks after the entrance exam, Izuku throws himself into theorising to take his mind off his crumbling dream. He speeds through a fresh notebook while writing up notes and brainstorming and sketching the three teenagers he ran into at the exam. Nothing adds up. No matter how many times he goes over the facts, none of it makes sense.</p>\n<p>What is the chance of all three of his childhood heroes\u2014three heroes who no one else seems to know of, including All Might\u2014having siblings his age who all decided to take the UA entrance exam?</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t sound too impossible. Plenty of heroes have younger siblings and many children of hero families are encourage to go into heroics. But how could they all have identical quirks as their older counterparts? Why is Izuku the only person that knows Floaty Girl and Prince Charming exist? Why does he remember a slightly different Ingenium to the rest of the world?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In April, Izuku starts his high school career.</p>\n<p>UA\u2019s campus is huge. When he finally arrives at Class 1-A, he pauses outside the door.</p>\n<p>Kacchan was accepted into the hero course, too. Izuku is dreading coming across him during school, doubly so if they end up being assigned to the same class, but he\u2019s stronger, now. He\u2019s not a quirkless kid left behind by the rest of the world. He can face Kacchan head on.</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t stop thinking about the three teenagers who look eerily similar to Floaty Girl, Almost-Ingenium, and Prince Charming, the kids related to his childhood heroes in some way. Did they pass the entrance exam? They must have. Izuku can\u2019t imagine a world in which they failed. Will they be in his class? How does he act normal around them if they are?</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a steadying breath. He can\u2019t get lost in his head. He almost failed the entrance exam because he overthought everything. He can\u2019t sabotage his high school career, too.</p>\n<p>Izuku opens the door to Class 1-A and, for a moment, he\u2019s sure that he\u2019s walked straight into a dream.</p>\n<p>Baby-faced versions of his childhood friends are seated in neat rows. They\u2019re dressed in matching uniforms and wearing bland expressions as they watch Almost-Almost Ingenium\u2014Iida Tenya, the boy says\u2014bicker with Kacchan.</p>\n<p>There is Alien Queen. Her pink skin looks even brighter against the grey of the uniform blazer. And there is Electro with his yellow hair, a streak of black zigzagging through his fringe. There is Earphone, twirling her ears around one finger.</p>\n<p>There, right in front of him, is over half of his childhood heroes, staring as Izuku chokes on air. His mouth is open but no sound is coming out, just the hollow rattle of air sucked through his lungs.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Almost-Almost-Ingenium marches over to meet him. \u201cI\u2019m from Somei Private Academy. My name is\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Izuku interrupts, and then immediately regrets it. That sounded rude. He doesn\u2019t want them to think he\u2019s rude. He continues on bravely, \u201cI\u2019m Midoriya. Nice to meet you, Iida.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iida praises him for realising there was more to the exam when, in fact, Midoriya had been running on blind instinct for the entire ten minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that curly hair!\u201d Izuku spins around and almost swallows his tongue. Floaty Girl\u2019s sister. \u201cYou\u2019re the plain-looking one. You passed, just like Present Mic said.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks good in her uniform. Iida looks good in it, too. Tall and fit and attractive, like they were born to wear these uniforms, unlike Izuku, who twisted his tie into a too short knot and spent almost twenty minutes staring at himself in the mirror, trying to come to terms with his reflection. Standing in his bathroom while wearing the nationally famous UA uniform made him feel like an alien. An impostor.</p>\n<p>But none of his classmates look ruffled. They\u2019re calm, bored almost, when Izuku\u2019s head is spinning, because he\u2019s at UA, he has a quirk, and he\u2019s surrounded by over a dozen teenagers who look like the spitting image of his childhood heroes.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo somewhere else if you want to play at making friends. This is the hero course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their homeroom teacher is bundled up in a yellow sleeping bag on the floor, sucking at a juice packet. This isn\u2019t the oddest thing to happen to Izuku today and it isn\u2019t even 9am. At least he doesn\u2019t recognise this shaggy man from years-old memories. If, say, the Operator was his homeroom teacher, Izuku might have finally broke down crying right there in the doorway.</p>\n<p>The quirk assessment is stressful and requires his full concentration, but Izuku spends the time gazing at his classmates with quiet wonder. His chest hurts. There\u2019s something too-big there, pressing up against his ribs, and he doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t feel like the time he first met All Might. That had felt like exploding from the inside out, like his entire life had been leading up to the moment that he was on his knees and choking on bile and slime, looking up at his idol and struggling to find words.</p>\n<p>This feels like accidentally stumbling across old friends. This feels like re-watching a favourite childhood series and re-discovering why you were so enthralled with this world, these characters. This is coming home to find a long lost family member sat at the kitchen table, only to realise that they can\u2019t remember who you are.</p>\n<p>Izuku wrenches his eyes away from Shift Hands, who\u2019s strength grip reached over 500 kilograms like it was nothing, and accidentally catches Aizawa\u2019s eye. He\u2019s staring at him. Watching him. How long has he been doing that?</p>\n<p>Izuku passes the quirk assessment, but barely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today is their first block of hero training, lead by All Might. They\u2019re receiving their costumes this morning. The too-big feeling in his chest is back. It\u2019s a feeling that Izuku has been carrying since he first woke up to water in his ears and All Might\u2019s smile swimming above him.</p>\n<p>Izuku changes into his costume in a trance. Mum made this for him. It\u2019s a tribute for the two heroes in his life\u2014his mum and All Might\u2014and he will wear it with pride.</p>\n<p>He has to take a moment in the change rooms to breathe and calm himself down, in case he starts crying in front of his classmates. By the time he\u2019s dressed, everyone is already down at Ground Beta, grouped in front of All Might, admiring each other\u2019s costumes.</p>\n<p>Izuku jogs out of the tunnel. His class comes into view, and suddenly the afternoon sun seems ice-cold, freezing Izuku right through.</p>\n<p>Uraraka meets him at the mouth of the tunnel, dressed in her own hero costume. A bubbly, soft pink costume\u2014a costume similar to the one he has known for ten years. A costume almost like the one he has sketched over and over again. Floaty Girl\u2019s costume.</p>\n<p>Uraraka claps her hands together and smiles like she isn\u2019t in the process of destroying Izuku\u2019s mind. \u201cDeku! Your costume looks cool. Really down to Earth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour costume,\u201d Izuku says, ignoring the compliment that might normally make him too flustered to piece together a coherent sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka rubs at the back of her head. \u201cI should\u2019ve written down what I wanted. I ended up getting a skintight bodysuit. It\u2019s embarrassing \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you look great. Battle ready and also very pretty,\u201d Izuku says on autopilot. He\u2019s too overwhelmed to be self-conscious. Uraraka isn\u2019t. She flushes behind her translucent visor. \u201cWas it inspired by something? Someone? An existing hero or a family member?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was too busy and too nervous to think of anything concrete that I wanted. Not like everyone else.\u201d Uraraka plays with the baubles wrapped around her wrist. Izuku\u2019s heart twists. The gesture is so familiar. \u201cI wrote down my quirk and my measurements and that I liked heroes with space aesthetics, and they created this, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look great, Uraraka!\u201d Iida\u2019s voice floats through a solid helmet. Uraraka shakes off her nervousness and jumps around Iida, complimenting his costume, while Iida stands tall and pretends not to be as pleased by the praise as he clearly is.</p>\n<p>Izuku unsticks his tongue from the roof of his mouth. \u201cIida. Your costume. It was inspired by your brother, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIngenium, yes,\u201d Iida says, standing up even straighter. \u201cI am honoured to be a part of the Iida family. My brother is the person I look up to the most.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo cool!\u201d Uraraka says again.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? Izuku\u2019s hands itch. He wishes he had his notebook with him so he could write all of his down. He\u2019s going to need another journal soon. He\u2019s gotten more notes about this mystery in the past few months than he has had in years.</p>\n<p>Uraraka floats away to compliment a few other girls on their costumes and Iida strides away to scold someone for playing around with their suit. Izuku stands there, a few feet out of the tunnel, staring out at his class.</p>\n<p>All of them are dressed like his childhood heroes. All of them, aside from Mineta, who doesn\u2019t resemble anyone from his past, and Todoroki, who\u2019s features match the Ice Prince, but who\u2019s all-white costume is different from the blue jumpsuit Izuku remembers, and Kacchan, who\u2014</p>\n<p>Kacchan, who is wearing orange, green, and black. Kacchan, who has the familiar orange cross over his chest, and the grey kneepads, and the clunky grenades strapped over his gloves.</p>\n<p>Kacchan has an explosion quirk. Izuku remembers being off-balanced at the similarities between his saviour\u2019s quirk and the quirk used against him every other day in elementary school. Maybe it\u2019s not similar. Maybe it\u2019s the same quirk. The same\u2014</p>\n<p>All Might calls the class to order. Izuku makes his way through the crowd of classmates on autopilot. All Might\u2019s instructions wash over him, all white-noise, because he\u2019s too busy staring at his classmates, who look like miniature replicas of his childhood heroes. There\u2019s Froppy, her tongue hanging out of her mouth, dressed in yellow and green. There\u2019s Prince Charming with his costume glinting in the sun. There\u2019s Yellow Might in his banana-yellow suit. There\u2019s Earphone, and Alien Queen, and Red. And Grenade\u2019s green and orange costume on Kacchan.</p>\n<p>The costume\u2019s aren\u2019t identical to the ones Izuku remembers. Kaminari\u2019s costume is black and white with silver highlights, where Electro\u2019s suit was predominately silver. Izuku remembers the way his metallic jumpsuit caught the sunlight when he played with him, glittering like a discoball. Floaty Girl\u2019s costume was almost entirely pale pink, where Uraraka has more than one colour in her\u2019s. Yaoyorozu\u2019s costume is entirely different to Gensis\u2019s. She doesn\u2019t even have pants right now.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHero costumes change over the years,\u201d</em> All Might had said months ago on that trash-heaped beach, staring down at Izuku\u2019s battered hero journal. \u201c<em>A hero\u2019s suit may look very different ten years down the road.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s throat closes up.</p>\n<p>No. No, it can\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes flick to Kacchan, glowering at the ground instead of looking at any of their classmates or All Might, his fists clenched, practically vibrating with pent-up energy.</p>\n<p>If this insane theory holds true, then that would mean that\u2014</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>All Might starts sectioning off the class into pairs. Izuku wants to crawl away and find an classroom empty, curl into a tight ball, and scream into his hands. He can\u2019t do that, even if it feels like his brain is melting out of his ears. His childhood friends are precious to him, but his dream, his burning, beautiful dream of being a hero, is everything. He can\u2019t fall to pieces now.</p>\n<p>Izuku shoves his hand in the air. \u201cUh, All Might? Can you please repeat the instructions? I didn\u2019t, um, hear any of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOverwhelmed, young Midoriya?\u201d All Might asks. Izuku laughs shakily and rubs at the back of his head. The class titters behind him. It sounds good-natured. Someone behind him says that they\u2019re overwhelmed, too. He thinks it might be Electro.</p>\n<p>At the back of the class, Kacchan doesn\u2019t mock him for being spacey. They\u2019re divided into pairs, and when Kacchan and Iida circle around them to head into the building, Kacchan gives him a look that Izuku can\u2019t decipher.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kacchan confronts him that afternoon, after Izuku is released from the nurse\u2019s office. He can\u2019t remember the last time he saw Kacchan cry.</p>\n<p>After everything comes out about One for All, Kacchan opens his mouth to say something else, but then, after glancing at All Might, snaps it shut again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything else, young Bakugou?\u201d All Might asks. \u201cThis is a safe space\u2014feel free to share anything! Honesty is a valuable trait in a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan looks at Izuku. He\u2019s been looking at him since he was accepted into UA, trying to work out how Izuku had passed the exam without a quirk, but this seems different, somehow. Kacchan doesn\u2019t look like he wants to incinerate Izuku. His gaze is searching, almost.</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows. \u201cKacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan rubs tears and snot off his chin, and then sneers. \u201cNo. I have nothing to say to either of you fuckers. I\u2019ll beat you to the top\u2014no matter who you are, or what shitty quirk you\u2019ve been given, or what you did when I was a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do with Kacchan. Was he this awkward with Izuku at first, or had it been different for them? He doesn\u2019t remember. Most of his memories of that time in his life is blurry with shock, hero-worship, and sheer exhaustion.</p>\n<p>\u201cFriendly competition can be healthy,\u201d All Might says. \u201cIn correct dosages, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet fucked,\u201d Kacchan tells All Might, their mutual idol, their teacher, before turning on his heel and jogging away.</p>\n<p>\u201cA very brash young man,\u201d All Might says, mostly to himself.</p>\n<p>Izuku stares after Kacchan, broken arm cradled to his chest. His heavy cast presses against a bruise the size of a fist on his sternum.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cyou could say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes Izuku a while to ask them. He\u2019s thought about the questions he wants to ask over and over. He turns the problem over in his head during class, staring at the back of his classmates\u2019 heads; and during training exercises, almost getting knocked out because he\u2019s too distracted by the familiar quirks being activated around him; and at night, in his own bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to sleep.</p>\n<p>In the end, he blurts it out on the way to an off-campus training exercise.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any siblings?\u201d</p>\n<p>If Asui is bothered by the strange, nervous boy in her class that just shouted a question in her face, she doesn\u2019t show it. \u201cI do. I have a younger brother and sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYounger? Not older?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Asui says evenly. \u201cMidoriya, you\u2019re very sweaty. Ribbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku turns to someone else on the bus. \u201cWhat about you, Kirishima? Siblings?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m an only child,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cI\u2019m totally jealous, though. I\u2019ve always wanted siblings to play with. Being an older brother sounds so manly. In the end, my parents only ever had me, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku jerks to his feet, hands balled up into fists, and shouts, \u201cDoes anyone here have siblings?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, what\u2019s gotten into Midoriya?\u201d Kaminari asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s nerves?\u201d Kirishima suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is just his personality,\u201d Asui says. \u201cHe\u2019s very enthusiastic. Ribbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one is answering him, so Izuku barrels on, panic creeping into his tone, \u201cRaise your hand if you have any older siblings!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, no,\u201d Kaminari says, \u201che\u2019s definitely lost it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obediently, several people raise their hand. Not nearly enough, though. A few people start talking about younger siblings or what it is like being an only child, so Izuku says again, near-frantic, \u201cOlder cousins?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a strange and chaotic energy Midoriya is radiating,\u201d Tokoyami says to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>A few more people raise their hands. There\u2019s still a third of the class missing, though. It\u2019s like Izuku is accumulating puzzle pieces of all different shapes and sizes and none of them match up, all of the clues pointing to a different theory. It makes Izuku\u2019s head hurt.</p>\n<p>From the front of the bus, Aizawa says, \u201cSit down. We aren\u2019t there yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>He barely raises his voice, but Izuku squeaks and sits down so fast his curls bounce around his face. Kirishima reaches around Asui and pats him on the shoulder. His smile is kind, though awkward, like he doesn\u2019t quite know how to help the weird boy who takes nonsensical surveys on the way to training simulations, which makes sense. This whole situation must seem crazy from an outside perspective.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay, Midoriya?\u201d Ashido asks. Izuku nods at her stiffly.</p>\n<p>\u201cTone down the energy a little bit,\u201d Kaminari advises.</p>\n<p>Izuku looks away from them just in time to catch Aizawa watching him through the overhead mirror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku had been planning on asking more questions at lunch, but the villain attack ruins that.</p>\n<p>For the third time in his life, Izuku runs into villains and his childhood friends don\u2019t melt out of the shadows to beat them into the ground and whisk Izuku off to safety. This time, it\u2019s Izuku that fights for his friends\u2019 lives. He half-expects to turn and see his classmates\u2019 adult-counterparts beside him, but he never does. They\u2019re all as young and frightened as he is.</p>\n<p>At one point, Shigaraki reaches for Asui and Izuku goes numb. A part of his brain shuts down, flooded with adrenaline.</p>\n<p>\u201cFroppy,\u201d he chokes out, and then, \u201c<em>Smash!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>All Might arrives soon after. His classmates slump over or cry out in relief, and it\u2019s strange, seeing the exhausted hope on the faces of people who have always been the ones to save <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>A few days after the USJ attack, Izuku is pulled aside by two people. The first is Asui.</p>\n<p>She corners him in the cafeteria. \u201cYou called me Froppy,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Izuku avoids looking her in the eye, gripping his lunch tray like a shield. \u201cWhat? No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYesterday, when the villain with the decaying quirk was reaching for me.\u201d Asui watches him evenly. She\u2019s too observant. She can probably see every drop of sweat beading at his temples. \u201cYou said \u2018Froppy.\u2019 How did you know my hero name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour what?\u201d Izuku asks, strangled.</p>\n<p>\u201cFroppy,\u201d she says it so casually, Izuku almost doesn\u2019t understand, at first. \u201cI decided that I wanted my hero name to be Froppy when I was a kid. I\u2019ve never told anyone here that. How did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku says, trying to keep his voice steady. \u201cYou\u2014you must have misheard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mishear,\u201d Asui says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very traumatic. It was hard to make sense of what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Izuku turns on his heel and flees. Asui doesn\u2019t chase him, but she does watch him during class, like she\u2019s waiting for him to explode. Izuku pretends not to see. He does feel a little bit like he will explode every time he sees her staring at him from of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>Aizawa returns to teaching a few days after the attack, swathed in bandages. He doesn\u2019t have any trouble keeping them all in line, even with his injuries.</p>\n<p>After the bell rings at the end of the day, Aizawa dismisses the class, and then says, \u201cMidoriya. Stay behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gathers his things and stands in front of Aizawa.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve acting strange,\u201d Aizawa begins. \u201cMore strange than any fifteen year old should be acting. You\u2019re constantly unbalanced by your classmates, and I keep catching you staring at them like you\u2019re waiting for something to happen. At first, I thought you had poor social skills, but that\u2019s not it. You were odd yesterday, too. More odd than usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes bore straight into Izuku\u2019s. He wonders if Aizawa\u2019s stare seems heavier than most people\u2019s because his quirk is located in his eyes, or if that\u2019s just the kind of person Aizawa is.</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Aizawa says before Izuku can think of an excuse. \u201cDid you know about the villain attack before it happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku realises how bad this must seem\u2014acting suspicious in the week before villains infiltrated a high security school. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku dries his sweaty palms on his uniform blazer, swallows, and then begins, \u201cWhen I was five, I was almost attacked by a villain, and two heroes jumped in to save me. Those two heroes were Uraraka and Todoroki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few months later,\u201d Izuku continues, \u201cI was attacked again. Three heroes saved me before the villain could touch me. It was Ashido, Kaminari, and Sero. Then Iida saved me from a runaway truck, and Asui and Uraraka saved me from drowning, and then Tokoyami and Shoji saved me sometime after that. The average person only has two or three encounters with villains in their life, but I\u2019ve had half a dozen every <em>year</em> since I was little. For ten years, villains have been trying to attack me, and heroes have been jumping in to save me. Heroes that look like \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku scrubs a hand through his hair. Aizawa isn\u2019t looking at him like he wants to string him up anymore, but Izuku stills squirms under his dark-eyed stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter so many villain attacks, why weren\u2019t placed in witness protection?\u201d Aizawa asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cI never talked to the police. The heroes never recorded these events. And every time I would go home and look up the heroes that saved me and \u2026 and I\u2019ve never come across any record that says they exist. Until I came here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku wets his lips. Putting it into words makes this whole thing real, even if it must sound crazy to someone who hasn\u2019t lived it. \u201cThe others in my class\u2014it\u2019s them. Every one of them, aside from Mineta, are the heroes that saved me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe heroes that saved you,\u201d Aizawa says, \u201chow old were they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn their late twenties, I think,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your theory?\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>Izuku hesitates. He wets his lips again, and says, \u201cTime travel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa doesn\u2019t flinch away, even though Izuku feels like he\u2019s unravelling. This is a truth that Izuku has been too scared to say aloud, to even write down, because then, he would have to consider it, <em>really</em> consider it, rather than shoving it deep down whenever the thought crossed his mind.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s insane, but it\u2019s the only explanation that makes sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were visited by eighteen heroes?\u201d Aizawa asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNineteen. One is missing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>\u201cA hero with a brainwashing quirk. He might have just been an underground hero, but I\u2019m fairly familiar with underground heroes, and I\u2019ve never seen anyone mention a hero like him. And he referenced the other heroes, too, so I know that they all know each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa is silent. Izuku fidgets, fingers curling and uncurling in the hem of his blazer.</p>\n<p>Aizawa leans back against his desk. Izuku gets the impression that he would be rubbing at his temples if both his arms weren\u2019t bound in slings. Finally, Aizawa says, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku jumps. \u201cSir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t repeat this to anyone,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cThe time travelling or my swearing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it is, then?\u201d Izuku\u2019s heart is beating quickly. It feels like it might thud right out of his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s time travel. My classmates are really\u2014they\u2019re really time travelling? They\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sucks in a sharp inhale. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cI imagine this is overwhelming, but don\u2019t stress yourself out over it. It\u2019s out of our hands, regardless. So long as you don\u2019t reveal any information to others, especially your classmates, and you don\u2019t go out of your way to change the timeline, everything will be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChange the timeline?\u201d Izuku repeats, feeling weak.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the chaotic type.\u201d Aizawa pauses, and then corrects himself. \u201cNot the chaotically <em>evil</em> type, rather. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>He bids Izuku goodbye and sends him on his way. Aizawa still looks tired, though. More tired than usual.</p>\n<p>As Izuku leaves, he hears Aizawa mumble under his breath, \u201cThis class is going to be the death of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku remembers the Ice Prince being composed, cool, but never cold. Todoroki barely looks at Izuku and when he does, it\u2019s distant, like he is calculating Izuku\u2019s worth, and finding him wanting.</p>\n<p>Izuku is stood in the doorway before class. He watches Kirishima and Kaminari talk to Kacchan\u2014Kaminari looks as though he\u2019s poking a sleeping bear and enjoying every minute twitch of Kacchan\u2019s eye, while Kirishima genuinely seems to be enjoying Kacchan\u2019s presence. It\u2019s not that Kaminari doesn\u2019t enjoy Kacchan\u2019s presence, of course, but Kirishima brightens under Kacchan\u2019s gaze like a flower tipping their face to the sun. Izuku thinks he could recognise them as Red and Grenades from that look alone.</p>\n<p>To his credit, Kacchan doesn\u2019t push either of them away. There are a few members of their class that Kacchan seems to have endless patience for.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t notice how long he\u2019s been standing there, until Todoroki says from behind him, \u201cYou\u2019re blocking the doorway. Move.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku jumps out of the way, almost tripping over his own feet, and Todoroki breezes past him without a second glance. It\u2019s a little rude, sure, but for most of his school life, Izuku has dealt with much worse. For some reason, though, Izuku is left staring after Todoroki\u2019s retreating back, throat closing up.</p>\n<p>Todoroki is different to the Ice Prince. Izuku could let that get to him. He could take this as a sign of broken friendship and give up, but then, he has never been very good at giving up, even when everyone else tells him that he should.</p>\n<p>Instead, Izuku leans against the doorway, watches Todoroki breeze through the crowd of his classmates like he\u2019s untouchable and thinks, <em>How did this happen? </em>And then,<em> How do I fix it?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku invites Todoroki to sit with them during lunch, but Todoroki rebuffs him. His stare chills Izuku right through. He is still getting used to his friends not knowing who he is, and starting years-old relationships from the beginning again; it hurts to see one of his first friends look at him like he\u2019s a bug.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just his quirk that is cold, no?\u201d Aoyama leans against the counter to Izuku\u2019s left. He\u2019s swirling juice in a wine glass. Some of it spills over the lip of the glass and stains his white button up. He pinches it between two fingers. \u201cMerde.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever considered swearing in English?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Aoyama looks up at him. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t know how to get juice stains out of a white shirt, but maybe his classmates do. Uraraka says that Iida carries more fatherly energy than all their upperclassmen put together.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t get through to Todoroki, but he\u2019s not the only person in their class of twenty. He\u2019s not the only friend that Izuku needs to grow close to again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Aoyama,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cwould you like to eat lunch with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aoyama lights up. He lets go off his shirt and bounces on his pointed heels, ruined shirt forgotten. \u201cYes! Yes, I would love to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aoyama seems to remember himself. He stops bouncing and coughs into his fist, pushing his hair out of his eyes. \u201cI mean, sure. If you want me there, I suppose it would be impolite to refuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku grabs his wrist and tugs him towards the table he shares with his friends. \u201cCome on, then. Maybe we can ask the others about your shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aoyama goes shy under Izuku\u2019s touch. His friends seem baffled by Aoyama\u2019s presence, at first, but make him feel welcome anyway.</p>\n<p>Floaty Girl, Almost-Ingenium, and Froppy were often seen in each other\u2019s company, but Prince Charming often came alone. Izuku had never seen him with these three heroes. Prince Charming said it was because he preferred to work on his own and soak up the spotlight for himself, and Izuku believed him, but seeing him animatedly talking about hero costumes and listening to Iida\u2019s advice about getting stains out of white clothes, going so far as to talk out his phone to take notes\u2014it settles something in his stomach.</p>\n<p>This is right. This is how his friends should be\u2014happy and thriving. Together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku has been looking for the Operator. He thinks Aizawa knows that, but he hasn\u2019t said anything to stop him or assisted Izuku in his task. Since their conversation a few days after the USJ attack, Aizawa hasn\u2019t said anything else about time travel to Izuku, but sometimes, Izuku will catch Aizawa staring at him from across the classroom or the training field with an unreadable expression.</p>\n<p>If the Operator was somewhere on campus, if he had tried out for the hero course like the rest of them, Aizawa might know. It\u2019s possible that All Might knows, too. He was one of the examiners, after all. He might know of a brainwashing quirk. But Izuku doesn\u2019t want to share this with them. He wouldn\u2019t be able to explain to All Might why he needed to know, and there\u2019s something about the way that Aizawa watches him that tells Izuku that this is something he has to do for himself. It\u2019s not Aizawa\u2019s task. It\u2019s his.</p>\n<p>Izuku hovers outside of Class 1-B\u2019s room for a few days until Monoma is even more worked up than usual and keeps trying to pick fights with him at lunchtime. Izuku doesn\u2019t recognise any of the Class 1-B students. Disappointing, but not surprising.</p>\n<p>He goes home and brainstorms as he lifts weights with one hand. The Operator is the only missing hero. If Kacchan is Grenades, and at this point, Izuku is certain that he is, than every other single hero is accounted for and in the same class. Class 1-A is compromised of Izuku, eighteen baby-faced versions of his childhood friends, and Mineta.</p>\n<p>Izuku definitely never met anyone like Mineta when he was younger. If it was someone like Tokoyami that was missing, then Izuku might have thought that they were working from the shadows and never ran into Izuku, but Mineta isn\u2019t that kind of a hero. From what Izuku has seen, Mineta isn\u2019t any kind of hero at all.</p>\n<p>The pieces start slotting together: one missing hero, and one un-herolike student, and one teacher that has expelled hundreds of students in the past.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d Izuku says to Aizawa the next day during a lull in hero training, \u201chow often do hero classes get new students?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot often,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it can happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. If there\u2019s a space open and the student in question has proven themselves worthy of being transferred into the hero course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTransferred,\u201d Izuku repeats, nearly vibrating with excitement. His hand itches for a pen. \u201cTransferred from another department?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa eyes him with suspicion. It\u2019s a familiar look, these days. Aizawa always seems to be waiting for Izuku to do something, though Izuku hasn\u2019t worked out what exactly that <em>something</em> is.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf students from General Education prove themselves, they can be transferred into the hero course,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeneral Education,\u201d Izuku repeats.</p>\n<p>How could he have been so blind? He\u2019s watched the sports festival since he was little. He\u2019s seen the General Education students scrambling after the hero course, desperate to snatch a few minutes in the spotlight for themselves, and he knows the Operator. He\u2019s written pages and pages theorising about his quirk. It works on people. The entrance exam had been full of robots.</p>\n<p>The Operator was supposed to be in Class 1-A with the rest of the eighteen other budding heroes, but he wasn\u2019t accepted because of his quirk, so he must have settled for the next best option: General Education.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, sir!\u201d Izuku says. He spins around, but before he can run off to speed through his training (and then, after the bell, race deeper into campus to find the other departments), Aizawa yanks him back by the hood.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go meddling with things,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa scans his face, looking for some hint of a lie, before releasing him. \u201cProblem child. Go practise with the rest of your classmates. And don\u2019t go sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At lunchtime, Uraraka sighs and slumps into her sleep. Her chin rests on Izuku\u2019s shoulder, but she\u2019s looking beyond him, at something on the other side of the cafeteria.</p>\n<p>Izuku glances over his shoulder. Asui is waiting in the food line with Hagakure. Her hair is done up in twin buns. She\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should tell her,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Uraraka jumps up like she\u2019s been burnt and claps her hands to her face. Beneath her splayed fingers, her cheeks flush pink. \u201cWhat? Tell who? I\u2019m not\u2014I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should tell Asui that you like her,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI bet she\u2019d return your feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Sorry, sensei,</em> Izuku thinks. <em>I had to interfere here. Just a little bit. Uraraka is my best friend.</em></p>\n<p>Uraraka peeks at him through the slats of her fingers. \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a hunch,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, the Operator seeks out their class without being prompted.</p>\n<p>\u201cDepending on the results of the sports festival,\u201d he says, bracketed by stone-faced students from other departments, \u201cthey\u2019ll consider our transfer into the hero course. And it seems they may also transfer people out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka and Iida gulp beside him, intimidated by that idea, by the ice in the Operator\u2019s eyes, but Izuku has to stop himself from pushing past his classmates and jumping on the Operator in excitement. Something tells him that he\u2019s not here to make friends. Not with anyone in the hero course, anyway.</p>\n<p>But the Operator has a plan. He\u2019s coming. He hasn\u2019t given up. Izuku doesn\u2019t know what will happen when all nineteen of his friends are in the one place; he just knows that it needs to happen.</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a deep breath and steps forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d he says, trying to ignore the way everyone\u2019s eyes dart to him, \u201cI\u2019m Midoriya Izuku. Pleased to meet you. Let\u2019s be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone around them splutters. Somewhere to his left, Kaminari calls, \u201cOi, Midoriya, don\u2019t make friends with the guy that just dropped a declaration of war on us!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you just because you try and play nice,\u201d says the Operator.</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to go easy on us. Try your hardest. Don\u2019t give up until your dreams are realised. But, in the meanwhile, I\u2019d like for us to be friends. In this class, we\u2019re already competitors. When we\u2019re heroes, we\u2019ll be aiming for the same top spots. We don\u2019t go easy on one another, but we\u2019re still friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ashido groans. \u201cMidoriya, no fair! You can\u2019t keep showing us up with that hero attitude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was so manly,\u201d Kirishima says, sniffing. \u201cThe true spirit of heroism.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t look away from the Operator, but he can feel his cheeks redden at their comments. The Operator doesn\u2019t look away, either. He\u2019s tall. Izuku remembers him being tall, but he had half-expected that to be a product of his child-mind, when every adult seemed to loom over him, but it wasn\u2019t. The Operator stands half a head taller than the other students, and he will only grow with age.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hold hands and skip through the flowers with you,\u201d he says, at last. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends. I\u2019m here to win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do both,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>The Operator scoffs and turns away, but Izuku isn't discouraged. So long as the Operator doesn\u2019t give up, so long as he holds tight to his dream and works to be transferred into Class 1-A, then it will all work out. They have almost three years of high school left. Izuku will make friends with them all before he graduates. This, he vows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is so rung out by his encounter with the Operator\u2014his encounter with all of them over the weeks they\u2019ve been at UA\u2014that he sits down next to Kirishima at lunchtime, grabs his wrist, and shoves his hand into his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Kirishima says, flexing his fingers against Izuku\u2019s scalp. \u201cAre you feeling alright, dude?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUA is very stressful,\u201d Izuku says honestly.</p>\n<p>Kirishima considers this, then shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely right about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima threads his fingers obediently through Izuku\u2019s curls, pushing his fringe out of his face again and again. Izuku leans into the touch like a cat. His eyes slip closed.</p>\n<p>He feels like Red. He is Red. A big, warm hand, solid and real, that\u2019s so gentle pushing through Izuku\u2019s hair, making him feel safe.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the table, Kaminari says, \u201cIs Midoriya okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d Kirishima says, \u201cbut I mean, UA is pretty insane. I don\u2019t blame him for getting overwhelmed and nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya has always been kind of weird,\u201d Sero says, \u201cso \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kirishima says, \u201cdon\u2019t be like that. This kind of thing is what friends are for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Friends, Izuku thinks sleepily. Kirishima and the others\u2014both the adult and the teenage version\u2014are his friends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to wave at the Operator at the starting line of the sports festival, but he turns away from him with a roll of his eyes. Izuku doesn\u2019t have time to worry about that, though. He has to prove to the world, to All Might, to himself, that he deserves to be here.</p>\n<p>When the final competition is one-on-one fights and Izuku is pitted against the Operator\u2014Shinsou Hitoshi\u2014it feels like fate. When Todoroki pulls him into a tunnel and pours out his heart, it feels even more so. The pieces are falling into place.</p>\n<p>Both boys don\u2019t like him at the moment, but that\u2019s okay. Izuku has a rough idea of how to help them, now. He can work with that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to listen to Shinsou\u2019s words. Izuku knows what it\u2019s like to lag behind everyone else because he doesn\u2019t have the right quirk\u2014or have a quirk at all\u2014but Shinsou is right; Izuku has been blessed. He\u2019s been blessed by other people. All Might, and his mum, and all the kind, brave people in his class. He\u2019s been blessed from that first moment ten years ago when he was saved by heroes, when Ice Prince and Floaty Girl\u2014<em>Todoroki and Uraraka</em>\u2014pulled him out of danger. Shinsou is counted in that number, even if he doesn't know it yet.</p>\n<p>Izuku has to do something to repay him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou!\u201d Izuku calls when the match is over. His throbbing hand is cradled to his chest, and the arena still echoes with the screams of the audience.</p>\n<p>Shinsou doesn\u2019t pause. He doesn\u2019t look at Izuku.</p>\n<p>Izuku trails after him. \u201cShinsou, wait!\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops, finally. He glares at Izuku over his shoulder, but there\u2019s no real heat in it. He just looks tired. \u201cWhat do you want? You\u2019ve already won.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYou can be a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need pity from the golden child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Golden child? Izuku draws in a deep breath, and forges on. \u201cNo, I mean it. Your quirk\u2014it might not have gotten you into the hero course, but there are loads of pro heroes that wouldn\u2019t have been able to pass the entrance exam either, like Earserhead and Midnight, and you can do so much with it. You can halt villains in their tracks. No other hero can do that. You can integrate criminals, get them to reveal their plans. You can free hostages without putting anyone in danger, and you can calm crowds of panicking people, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop.\u201d A vein of tension cuts through Shinsou\u2019s voice. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. Why are you telling me this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you can do it.\u201d He knows this better than he could ever say. \u201cI just\u2014I guess I want to see that. I want to see that kind of hero come into being. It\u2019d be awesome to work with that kind of hero. And, uh.\u201d Izuku scrubs at the back of his head and accidentally smears blood along his uniform collar. \u201cI meant what I said last week. I want to be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Present Mic is calling for them to clear the field, and up ahead, the General Education students are leaning over the railing, beckoning for Shinsou to come to them. Izuku\u2019s friends are somewhere behind him. He needs to go and visit Recovery Girl so he\u2019ll be ready for his upcoming match against Todoroki.</p>\n<p>Izuku balls his good hand into a fist, and says, \u201cShinsou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou blows out a breath. \u201cAre all of you hero kids this exhausting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re a handful, yes, but I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m a special case. Plus ultra, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the school motto means,\u201d Shinsou says.</p>\n<p>He turns, just enough for Izuku to see his glare melting into what could be called a smile. He still looks tired, but Izuku remembers the bags under the Operator\u2019s eyes, the exhausted twist of his lips, and thinks that it might just be a part of him, the same as All Might\u2019s bright smile and Uraraka\u2019s perpetual cheer.</p>\n<p>Izuku resists the urge to shuffle his feet. \u201cThen \u2026 friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou looks him up and down. \u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll see you around, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he strides off the field and gets swept up in his celebrating classmates. Izuku bounds off the field. He has to weather a lecture from Recovery Girl about his fingers, and figure out how to break through Todoroki\u2019s walls, and then, once the sports festival is over, follow through with his promise of friendship with Shinsou, but he can see the cogs turning. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s not sure what it is, but\u2014it\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mum is crying when Izuku comes home. He had excepted that. He saw her readying the living room before he left for school, stacking tissue boxes and water bottles on the coffee table like a soldier preparing to go to war.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t expected to see one of his battered hero journals laying open in her lap, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Mum says when he closes the door behind him. \u201cIzuku, I\u2019m so sorry. This is the second time I didn\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMum,\u201d Izuku starts.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took me a while to realise why all your classmates looked so familiar, but then I went into your room, and\u2014\u201d Mum holds up a page close to the back, where Izuku\u2019s newest notes are\u2014the ones he made at the beginning of semester. \u201cTime travel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Inko rounds the couch and pulls him into a hug. Her face is wet. He can feel it through his shirt, and he holds onto her tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mum says wetly. \u201cAll this time you were trying to tell me about these heroes and I thought they were imaginary. Oh, Izuku, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it sounds ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s shaking, just slightly, even as she holds onto him so fiercely that he doesn\u2019t think he could pull away, even with his newfound strength. She must be overwhelmed. Izuku has lived with this for years, and dealt with the realisation for weeks. Mum has only known about it for a day. A few hours.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were in so much danger,\u201d Mum says, choked up with tears. \u201cAll this time\u2014and these people saved you! They saved you. I have to\u2014I have to thank them. You have to invite them over, so I can thank them for looking after you for so many years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cThey\u2019re sixteen, like me. The heroes I met were adults in their twenties, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mum pushes him back, holds him at shoulder-length. \u201cThen when they\u2019re adults, when they know, you invite them over and I\u2019ll throw a dinner party. Promise me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku knows what names some of his classmates will choose before anyone else. Maybe he knew their names before the heroes themselves\u2014the small, child versions of the heroes\u2014had even decided. Asui would have been six when Froppy plucked Izuku out of the floodwaters and introduced herself for the first time. Had she decided on her hero name, then? Had she even known that she wanted to be hero?</p>\n<p>But Izuku doesn\u2019t know what most of his classmates will choose. Picking hero names is an exciting part of any hero course, but Izuku feels as though he\u2019s being introduced to his childhood friends for the second time. Or, maybe, like he\u2019s unlearning all the wrong guesses he made as a kid.</p>\n<p>The class swells with tension when Midnight calls for them to present their names, until Aoyama flounces up to the teachers desk and pronounces, \u201cShining Hero: I cannot stop twinkling!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks. The rest of the class muffles their snickers behind their hands.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not being introduced to his hero friends for the second time, he realises. These are still his classmates. His friends. His fellow fifteen year old students who don\u2019t know the first thing about choosing hero names. The names picked today may not be the names they use ten years from now.</p>\n<p>Ashido is next. \u201cAlien Queen!\u201d</p>\n<p>Midnight shoots her down, and she goes back to her seat, dragging her heels. Izuku chokes down a hysterical burst of laughter and tries to school his face into something he hopes his neutral. From the concerned look Sero shoots him, he hasn\u2019t managed it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good name,\u201d Ashido mumbles under her breath, and Izuku knows she will still be sour about it ten years in the future.</p>\n<p>Kirishima becomes \u201cRed Riot.\u201d Izuku is busy berating himself for how close he got to guessing the correct name\u2014one word off!\u2014and so he almost misses Kacchan smacking a hand on the desk in front of him. \u201c<em>Huh?</em> What the fuck kind of name is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile slips off Kirishima\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, Bakugou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Rocky?\u201d Kacchan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a cutesy name from Bakugou?\u201d Kaminari asks. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you had it in you, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRocky is a good name if you\u2019re trying to appeal to young kids,\u201d Midnight says, \u201cor Americans. But Red Riot is a great name, too, especially if you\u2019re going to continue the colour theme you currently have with your hair and costume.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRocky is super manly,\u201d Kirishima agrees, \u201cbut I\u2019m always wanted to pay homage to Crimson Riot, you know? He\u2019s the person that inspired me to be a hero in the first place. Sorry, bro.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan slouches down in his seat and mumbles something about Rocky being logical rather than cute, and being a great name for a hardening hero, and how none of them know anything.</p>\n<p>Izuku scribbles down each name as they\u2019re presented. Cellophane, and Tailman, and Pinky, and Charge Bolt, and Anima. He\u2019ll add them to his journal tonight. He no longer has to refer to his friends as the made-up names he made when he was a child. He has real names.</p>\n<p>He managed to guess Invisible Girl right. He still thinks Black Raven and Shift Hands are better hero names than Tsukuyomi and Tentacole, though. Maybe he can subtly suggest them to Tokoyami and Shoji during lunch. Yellow Might can finally be crossed out and replaced with Sugarman.</p>\n<p>Kacchan is still struggling with a name, which makes Izuku feel better about being stuck, too. Uraraka\u2019s name is perfect. After she smiles shyly and introduces herself as Uravity, Izuku\u2019s not sure how he referred to her as Floaty Girl for ten years. It doesn\u2019t fit her. Uravity is perfect.</p>\n<p>Todoroki names himself <em>Shouto</em>. Izuku imagines suggesting that Todoroki take up the name <em>Ice Prince,</em> imagines just saying the words Ice Prince out loud, to Todoroki\u2019s face, and ducks his head to hide his blush.</p>\n<p>Iida\u2019s whiteboard says <em>Tenya</em>. Izuku doesn\u2019t know how to help him. He wishes he did. He wishes he had a name to suggest, but now Almost-Ingenium seems sour and offensive after what has happened to Iida\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p>And then it\u2019s his turn, and he becomes Deku\u2014a choice he makes himself, this time. A murmur spreads through the class like ripples across a still pond, but Izuku stays firm. This is his name. This is the kind of hero he will become.</p>\n<p>Kacchan looks up from where he was furiously scribbling hero names onto his whiteboard. Izuku had half-expected him to fly across the room and smack the board out of his hand, but he doesn\u2019t. Kacchan remains in his seat. His face is oddly still.</p>\n<p>When Izuku sits back down, Kacchan glances at him over his shoulder. Izuku lays his whiteboard flat on his desk, and makes himself stay there, rather than shrinking away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku?\u201d Kacchan doesn\u2019t say the word like it\u2019s an insult, the way he has said it for ten years. He says it like he\u2019s trying it out, testing the way it feels in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cDeku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku,\u201d Kacchan says once more, and then scoffs, a barely audible noise even to Izuku, and turns back around to keep brainstorming on his whiteboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki starts sitting with them at lunch. Izuku has to stop himself from staring, even more than he had before, when he was still trying to piece together why his class was full of childhood friends.</p>\n<p>A week after the sports festivals, Izuku wets his lips, and says, \u201cHave you ever thought about growing your hair out, Todoroki?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki lowers his chopsticks. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. What if it gets in my face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could tie it back,\u201d Izuku says. His face feels hot. His cheeks must be bright pink. \u201cYou could braid it, or put it in a ponytail or a bun. It would look nice. I mean\u2014your hair is so unusual, so of course\u2014not unusual, that sounds mean, more like, uh, unique? Yes, unique. Growing it long would look really\u2014really good!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku wants to cram the words back into his mouth. He wants to work out how his classmates managed to time travel so he can go back a few minutes and choke himself out.</p>\n<p>Todoroki touches his fringe. \u201cIt\u2019s something to think about, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019d look great,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cVery handsome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya is right,\u201d Iida says. \u201cWith such an interesting two-toned colour, it would look very striking grown out. It might increase your marketability as a pro hero. We aren\u2019t just our costumes, after all\u2014our image is composed of our body language, and word choice, and even our hairstyles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. That\u2019s a good point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2014so you will?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Todoroki says.</p>\n<p>Izuku nods and stuffs his mouth with his lunch so he won\u2019t have to reply verbally. Under the table, Uraraka kicks him. She\u2019s smirking at him. It\u2019s a knowing smirk. It makes Izuku sweat more than he already is.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t</em>,\u201d Izuku tells her.</p>\n<p>Uraraka raises her hands defensively. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku had thought the days of his hero friends swooping in to save him, the way they had been saving him since he was little, were over, but he was wrong. They were still there to save him, but now, they weren\u2019t grown pro heroes who navigated fights easily. They were his friends. And this time, Izuku can fight by their side.</p>\n<p>After Stain, Iida accepts the name \u201cIngenium.\u201d Kacchan and Todoroki are still undecided on their names, but that\u2019s okay. They\u2019ll get there.</p>\n<p>He sees Shinsou at lunch and on his way to class. He lets Izuku sit with him every now and then, but he doesn\u2019t fully trust Izuku. Not yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like your equal,\u201d Shinsou says from the other side of the table, sitting stiffly between Asui and Uraraka. They\u2019re both doing their best to make him feel welcome, but they\u2019re here because Izuku has asked them to be, and Shinsou knows that.</p>\n<p>Uraraka puts down her chopsticks, and says, \u201cSometimes it feels as though my classmates are too far ahead of me and that might create feelings of inequality if I thought too hard about it, but I\u2019m choosing instead to let it inspire me to do better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka glances at Izuku when she says this. Asui says, \u201cYes, I know what you mean. Ribbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku says. They ignore him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cYou\u2019re in the same class. The same course. I\u2019m not even at the starting line yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2014\u201d Izuku tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen when you\u2019re at the starting line,\u201d Uraraka says, picking her chopsticks back up and twirling them the way he\u2019s seen her twirl a bo-staff on the rare days Aizawa lets them try out non-lethal weapons from the support course, \u201cwhen you\u2019re transferred into our class, we should spar. If you\u2019re behind us, you should use it as motivation to catch up, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka said when. Not if. When.</p>\n<p>Shinsou doesn\u2019t miss that, either. Some of the tension leeches out of his shoulders. \u201cAlright. But I won\u2019t go easy on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka smiles, a frightening kind of smile that she\u2019s aimed at Izuku a dozen different times during hero training, and says, \u201cI won\u2019t go easy on you, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kacchan swings between hot and cold without warning. When they were younger, he would antagonise Izuku almost daily, only to ignore him for long stretches of time for no discernible reason. Ignoring Izuku after the run-in with the slime villain made sense, but the rest of it\u2014the way he would blow up at seemingly innocent things, only to go silent the next day; the way he gravitated towards some of their classmates like he was starving for touch, after years of sneering at the concept of friendship; the way he sometimes stared at Izuku as though he was trying to look straight through him\u2014didn\u2019t make sense.</p>\n<p>Today, Kacchan is running hot. He had targeted Izuku during hero training, and seemed to take vicious pleasure in scorching his suit until it was more black than green. Their classmates edged away from them, like they were too bombs destined to set each other off. After class, an argument begins in the locker room, and spills out into the halls, until they were striding off to find somewhere they could yell at one another without a teacher giving them detention.</p>\n<p>Iida shouts after him to not give into Kacchan\u2019s antagonism, but Izuku dodges around him and follows Kacchan deeper into the school.</p>\n<p>Izuku is not the same quirkless kid that flinched under Kacchan\u2019s stare, and Kacchan\u2019s not the same person that burnt holes in his elementary school uniform, even if it sometimes feels like he is. They both have a long way to go, and they\u2019ll get nowhere if they keep avoiding one another. His childhood friends taught him that\u2014maybe not in words, but in the way they avoided his questions and turned to leave him after every attack, only ever staying, only ever revealing something about themselves, after Izuku chased after them.</p>\n<p>The other classes are getting out for lunch. They dodge around the Generation Education students and head round the back of the buildings, towards the empty space behind one of the gymnasiums.</p>\n<p>As soon as they get there, Kacchan throws Izuku up against one of the walls. Izuku\u2019s hand wraps around his wrist. He won\u2019t let himself be burnt. Not this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Kacchan asks, almost desperate beneath the razor-wire anger.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku begins, clenching his teeth, \u201cI know you don\u2019t like me, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou has a bundle of textbooks under one arm. He should be heading to lunch and squeezing in extra study between bites, not standing here, glaring at Kacchan like he\u2019s working out how to take him apart.</p>\n<p>Uraraka peers out from behind him. She seems almost sheepish, half-hidden behind him, but the second her gaze lands on Kacchan, holding Izuku up against the wall, all the timidness drains out of her. She straightens, face like stone, and she\u2019s a future hero again, not a sixteen year old girl.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut him down,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet the fuck out of here,\u201d Kacchan tells Uraraka, not looking at Shinsou. So he does know who Shinsou is, then. \u201cThis is between me and Deku\u2014you extras can fuck right off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Shinsou asks.</p>\n<p>Kacchan still ignores him. \u201cYou fucking follow us, round face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cShinsou saw me and asked what was wrong. I must have looked worried. Not sure why, though. It\u2019s not like I was worried my best friend was going to get hurt by the biggest bully at UA.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUraraka,\u201d Izuku tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to\u2014\u201d Kacchan cuts himself off. He pushes away from Izuku and shoves his hands into his pockets. A peace offering. \u201cWe were gonna have a conversation. Like adults. Now fuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s ever had a mature, level-headed conversation with Kacchan before. Shinsou and Uraraka seem to share his doubt. They both look like they\u2019re ready to jump into a fight with Kacchan, one of the most powerful students in their grade, if he attempts to hurt Izuku. It\u2019s a heady thought. No one has ever intervened before.</p>\n<p>But even steeled for a fight, ready to defend Izuku, they don\u2019t look like the Operator or Floaty Girl. They\u2019re dressed in their school uniforms. Uraraka\u2019s hair is damp from the showers and her tie is lopsided, like she dressed in a hurry. Shinsou has his books. They\u2019re not in their hero costumes\u2014Shinsou doesn\u2019t even have a hero costume yet\u2014and they\u2019re not stronger than their opponent. They\u2019re not twenty-something years old. They\u2019re young, and inexperienced, and burning up with anger on Izuku\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>Like this, they may not Izuku\u2019s childhood heroes, but they\u2019re still his friends.</p>\n<p>Friends he can keep. Friends who won\u2019t disappear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this with you here,\u201d Kacchan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cLet\u2019s all go back. We\u2019re missing lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan opens his mouth to argue, but a <em>bang</em> echoes from the other side of the gymnasium. Izuku has sparred enough times to know what it sounds like when someone is thrown into UA\u2019s reinforced walls.</p>\n<p>Someone flings out swearwords and then the <em>bang</em> comes again, louder this time. Izuku is sprinting around the gymnasium before he can think to tell someone to run for a teacher.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been so long that he thinks it\u2019s his classmates, at first. The costumes are similar, but their builds are wrong\u2014too tall and broad and muscled to belong to a teenager. He doesn\u2019t recognise the villain, but he recognises Earphone slumped below a dented wall, spitting blood and expletives into the dirt, and Red on top of the villain, handcuffing him with practised ease, below a second, even larger dent.</p>\n<p>His friends round the corner after him. Uraraka and Shinsou freeze. Uraraka makes a choked noise in the back of her throat, and Shinsou says, \u201cWhat the actual fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan surveys the scene and then says, \u201cThought you two had up and died.\u201d</p>\n<p>Earphone and Red look up\u2014Earphone Jack and Red Riot, Izuku corrects. He knows their hero names, now. He knows their real names, too. He knows what they look like first thing in the morning, trudging down the dorm stairs with bed-head, shoving toast into their mouths before class.</p>\n<p>He had gotten the first past of their hero names right, Izuku supposes. He\u2019d had half the puzzle pieces. Now, he has the full picture. An <em>almost</em> full picture, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Earphone Jack says.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Red Riot says, \u201chey, guys. How are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Earphone Jack repeats. \u201cReally? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else am I supposed to say?\u201d Red Riot asks.</p>\n<p>Earphone Jack considers this. She stands up, ignoring the blood dripping from one corner of her mouth, and waves her hand in the air. \u201cThese are not the droids you are looking for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kacchan says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked old-school pop culture,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Earphone Jack shrugs and fiddles with one of her ears. \u201cMy girlfriend is secretly a big nerd and got me into them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Uraraka\u2019s voice climbs in pitch with every word. \u201cCan someone\u2014can someone please explain what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Earphone Jack squeezes her eyes shut and rubs at her temple. \u201cRed, you do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Riot climbs off the bound villain and dusts dirt off his suit pants. He glances at the teenagers and opens his mouth. Closes it. Thinks for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a dream,\u201d Red Riot finally says. \u201cA joint dream. Together. None of this is real.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou crosses his arms. \u201cNice try, but no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hallucinating?\u201d Red Riot tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shinsou says.</p>\n<p>Red Riot pauses again. He\u2019s thinking so hard that his face scrunches up. Then he clicks his fingers and points at them. \u201cWe were hit by a weird quirk that aged us up! Yeah. That\u2019s it. We\u2019re your regular classmates that were changed by a quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor some reason, I don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Shinsou says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time travel,\u201d Kacchan says. His voice is level. Unbothered. Izuku thinks he must look like Uraraka\u2014staring at Kacchan, mouth open\u2014because Kacchan looks at them and scowls. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the dumb faces?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku pushes past Shinsou and Uraraka\u2014still staring at Earphone Jack and Red Riot and Kacchan, and trying to make sense of it all\u2014and shoves Kacchan up against the wall. Kacchan\u2019s hands go around his wrist. He doesn\u2019t push Izuku away. Faint explosives detonate in his palms, enough to tingle, but not enough to hurt. A warning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d Izuku says through his teeth, hands buried in Kacchan\u2019s uniform shirt. \u201cAll these years and you <em>knew</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet the fuck off me, Deku,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the whole time, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut for years, for at least a few years, you\u2019ve known about my friends. You were\u2014god.\u201d Izuku drops Kacchan and backs up a few steps. \u201cYou met them, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan shoves his shirt down to smooth out the wrinkles Izuku\u2019s hands have left. He doesn\u2019t look at Izuku when he says, \u201cYeah. I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to grab him again, but Red Riot grabs him around the waist and hoists him into the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlow down there, little dude,\u201d Red Riot says. \u201cDon\u2019t go starting a fight right now. I\u2019ll put you in time-out if I have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to squirm out of Red Riot\u2019s hold, but he\u2019s an adult\u2014an experienced pro hero\u2014and he holds him tight.</p>\n<p>Earphone Jack sighs. \u201cWhy do you have to be so fucking high-maintenance, Midoriya?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d Izuku says. \u201cWhat about Kacchan? Since apparently you knew him as a kid, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan bears his teeth at him. It\u2019s a strangely calm action for him. If Izuku were trying to attack him in a classroom setting, Kacchan would be fighting back. In the presence of their adult classmates, Kacchan seems subdued, almost. Tempered.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you promise to behave?\u201d Red Riot asks. Izuku would say that he sounds like a teacher, but if Izuku were trying to pick a fight with Kacchan in front of Aizawa, then Aizawa would probably string him up by his toes, not hold him in this gentle grip and talk to him so softly.</p>\n<p>Izuku sags in Red Riot\u2019s hold. \u201cFine. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Riot sets him down on the ground and then, like he can\u2019t stop himself, he ruffles Izuku\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>Uraraka seems to have gotten over her shock. She bounces around Earphone Jack and Red Riot. Shinsou watches on, even as he hangs back. He\u2019s less energetic than Uraraka, but his gaze is sharp, taking in every detail about the future heroes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we still friends in the future?\u201d Uraraka demands. \u201cDo we all become pro heroes? Where are you on the hero ranks? Where am I? Is anyone in the Top 10?\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Riot laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re almost as bad as Katsuki was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka glances at Kacchan. He shoves his hands in his pocket. \u201cWhat? Random heroes kept appearing out of thin air and saving me but wouldn\u2019t tell me their names, and you think I wasn\u2019t going to have a shit-tonne of questions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cwho was worse? Me or Kacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s asking this. He can\u2019t believe that his childhood friends don\u2019t just belong to him; this whole time, they\u2019ve belonged to Kacchan, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki,\u201d Red Riot says.</p>\n<p>Earphone Jack screws up her face, like the memory of their younger selves is painful. \u201cYes, but Midoriya was more of a nuisance. Bakugou kept trying to tackle us and scream questions at us, but Midoriya would run at the <em>villains</em>. It\u2019s hard to look after an inexperienced preteen when they\u2019re waving a red flag at villains.\u201d</p>\n<p>All eyes jump to Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never did that,\u201d Kacchan says, and he glances at Red Riot as though expecting to be praised for not hurling himself at villains when he was a child.</p>\n<p>Red Riot smiles. \u201cI know, buddy. Good work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku manages to catch Shinsou\u2019s eye. His eyebrows are raised, as if to say, <em>Are you seeing this?</em></p>\n<p>Izuku shrugs back, just as bewildered.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis explains so much,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cDeku, you were so jumpy during the first few weeks of term. I thought you were nervous about entering UA, because I was nervous, too, but then we started hero training and I realised you were even <em>more</em> nervous around the students than you were actually fighting or talking to the teachers, and I thought maybe it was social anxiety, but you were still just so \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOdd?\u201d Shinsou volunteers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was acting like a fucking freak,\u201d Kacchan says. Earphone Jack cuffs him around the ear, and he bares his teeth at her, but doesn\u2019t retaliate or even curse her out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were a little strange,\u201d Uraraka tells Izuku, apologetic. \u201cI thought it was just your personality for a while, too. I would never have thought it was because you were recognising some of our classmates who had time travelled and met you as a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d Shinsou drops his books and they land in the dirt with a loud thud, kicking up dust. He grabs Izuku by the shoulders. \u201cThe first time we met you tried to make friends with me, even though I was declaring war on the hero course. That was because it wasn\u2019t the first time we had met, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my god.\u201d Shinsou releases Izuku and steps away. He shoves his fingers through his hair. It sticks up under the stressed grip of his fingers. \u201cOh, my god. I thought you were aggressively nice or just stupid, but you <em>recognised</em> me. I time travelled, too. Which means\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou goes quiet. He rubs a hand over his mouth, like he\u2019s scared the words will escape without his consent.</p>\n<p>Uraraka looks from Shinsou, to Izuku, to the grown-up versions of their friends with wide eyes. \u201cDid I\u2014did I also\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe really fucked this up,\u201d Earphone Jack says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIida is going to lecture us for hours,\u201d Red Riot agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cI time travelled?\u201d Uraraka chokes out. She whirls on Izuku and he instinctively steps away from the feral look in her eyes. \u201cDeku, did you recognise me at the entrance exam?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Izuku begins, and then stops. He has no idea what to say. Aizawa talked about maintaining the timeline, but now Shinsou and Uraraka know that there are time travellers in their class. That isn\u2019t Izuku\u2019s fault, technically.</p>\n<p>Uraraka whirls on Kacchan. He shrugs at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know shit, round face. I never met you as a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka turns back to Izuku. \u201cDeku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her hands twitch by her side. He has a vision of himself floating up into the air and over the gymnasium, and never coming down again.</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows. \u201cYou, uh. You might have time travelled. Yes. You both did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou sits down, right there in the dirt, next to his pile of textbooks. He\u2019s gone white as a sheet. \u201cI\u2019m a hero,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Kacchan rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not a hero yet, jackass. You\u2019re sixteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I am, in the future.\u201d Shinsou looks to Izuku for confirmation. \u201cIf I travelled back in time, I would have done so as a hero. You know me. You\u2019ve met me, when I was a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIida isn\u2019t going to lecture us,\u201d Earphone Jack says to Red Riot. \u201cHe\u2019s going to fucking murder us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Riot makes a face, like he\u2019s already imagining what his murder at the hands of an adult Iida will feel like, and nods. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou stares up at Izuku from his place in the dirt. This is more painful than their match at the sports festival had been, when Izuku\u2019s childhood friend had spat insults at him. It hurts more then when the Operator had hugged him goodbye after buying him bubble tea and then turned a corner and disappeared, as though he were never there in the first place. Because Izuku has been there. He has sat on the ground like this, staring up at All Might, so desperate to be told that he could be a hero that he felt as though he was going to implode.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI met you when I was ten. You were an adult, a hero, and you saved my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou puts a hand over his mouth, like he\u2019s trying to stop himself from throwing up, and Kacchan whirls on Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go giving out that kind of information,\u201d Kacchan snaps. \u201cTime travel is fucking delicate.\u201d</p>\n<p>He reaches out to grab Izuku, but before he can touch him, Aizawa\u2019s capture weapon encircles his wrist and tugs him back. Everyone tenses up, even Earphone Jack and Red Riot.</p>\n<p>\u201cLunch has ended,\u201d Aizawa says, eyes burning red. All Might hovers behind him, mouth hanging open, but no sound coming out. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you all in class?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe got sidetracked?\u201d Uraraka offers.</p>\n<p>Aizawa looks over their heads at the adult version of his students. \u201cKirishima,\u201d he says. \u201cJirou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello again, sir,\u201d Red Riot says. Earphone Jack gives a small wave.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have all been careless,\u201d Aizawa tells the adults. \u201cBakugou is right; time travel isn\u2019t something to be used indiscreetly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime travel?\u201d All Might says. \u201cIs that really\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aizawa cuts in. He releases Bakugou, and glares at them. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Riot and Earphone Jack make to follow Aizawa, and he holds up a hand to stop them. He doesn\u2019t say anything. He stares at them, flat and exhausted all at once, and they step back.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Red Riot says. \u201cTime travellers probably shouldn\u2019t be seen walking around campus. We\u2019ll just, uh. We\u2019ll go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would scold you for not wearing disguises, voice modulators, or even masks when time travelling and talking to people from the past, but at this point, the damage has been done. You are lucky that there are people who clean up after negligent time travellers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Riot\u2019s shoulders slump, and Earphone Jack winces. Apparently, Aizawa\u2019s scolding will never stop being effective, even when his students have grown up.</p>\n<p>Kacchan bristles and opens his mouth like he\u2019s going to defend their friends, but Izuku interrupts him, \u201cThere are? Who?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cTime travel is a sensitive and often classified subject. And no, you can\u2019t talk to the agents who deal with time travellers. I doubt my old contacts even work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOld contacts?\u201d Izuku\u2019s thoughts jump to their conversation a few days after the USJ attack, when Aizawa had pulled him aside, exhausted but unsurprised by the idea of a class full of time travellers.</p>\n<p>Izuku figures it out a moment before Shinsou blurts out, \u201cYou\u2019re a time traveller.\u201d</p>\n<p>They turn to look at Shinsou. He\u2019s no longer sat on the dirt, looking as if the world was rearranging itself around him, but his hair is messier than usual and his slacks are coated with a thin layer of dirt. By his side, Uraraka looks as though she\u2019s hyped up on too much caffeine, jittery and dangerously over-energised.</p>\n<p>Izuku had eleven years to adjust to the mysterious heroes who continually dropped in on him, and then months to come to terms with his classmates being time travellers. Uraraka and Shinsou have only known for about an hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d Aizawa asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking tell me you met time travellers as kid, too,\u201d Kacchan says to Shinsou.</p>\n<p>Shinsou shakes his head, no. \u201cYou\u2019re calm, sir. You\u2019re normally calm, but when it comes to something that might endanger your students, you\u2019re usually more alert than this. You didn\u2019t question if something had happened to Kirishima or Jirou\u2014like an age accelerating quirk or shape shifters. You knew it was time travel immediately. You knew they were here to help. You knew it wasn\u2019t something to be concerned about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerceptive,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Kacchan demands. \u201cWhen did you time travel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for either of you,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cThere was a high-risk mission a few years ago. The few heroes in the know were clamouring for a chance to go back, but none of them were discreet. I volunteered. This person\u2019s life was vitally important to the timeline, and at the time, I had thought our lives were different enough that we wouldn\u2019t meet.\u201d Aizawa turns and heads to the building full of classrooms before they can question him any further.</p>\n<p>All Might stands in the shade of the gymnasium, blinking at Aizawa\u2019s retreating form.</p>\n<p>\u201cHad thought?\u201d All Might echoes. \u201cWait. <em>Wait</em>. Aizawa, come back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa marches them up to an empty classroom. They sit in the front row while Aizawa perches against the teacher\u2019s desk. Even All Might folds himself into a too small chair, staring up at Aizawa like he\u2019s never seen him before.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve already explained this to Midoriya and Bakugou,\u201d Aizawa says, ignoring the way Izuku spins in his seat to stare at Kacchan, \u201cbut the two of you can always do with a reminder, so I will say again: you cannot talk about time travel with anyone who doesn\u2019t already know. You shouldn\u2019t talk about it at all if you\u2019re in danger of being overheard.</p>\n<p>\u201cTime travel is tricky. There is a reason why time-related quirks are kept quiet. If just one villain successfully travelled back without being stopped, they could change the course of history. Time travel is kept from public knowledge so that no one else is tempted to meddle with the timeline.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku raises his hand in the air, even though this isn\u2019t a class. Aizawa just looks at him, so Izuku lowers it, and says, \u201cYou mentioned agents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime travellers can be sloppy,\u201d Aizawa says, and for some reason, he\u2019s glaring at his four students as he says this. \u201cMidoirya, Bakugou, you had heroes and villains travelling into your neighbourhood for years. Do you think the public wouldn\u2019t notice something was amiss? There are people that clean up after your messes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku picks at the graffiti etched into the side of the desk. He\u2019s missing class, he realises belatedly. It feels like such a small thing in the wake of all that has happened today.</p>\n<p>It feels strange, too, to know that the people on either side of them are dealing with their own revelations. He grew used to dealing with this on his own for over a decade, and now, Shinsou and Uraraka are almost bouncing in their seats, and Kacchan is slouched in his chair, unbothered by the lecture Aizawa is giving on the dangers of time travel. All Might is at the end of the row, his body leaning to one side, too tall to properly sit in a teenage-sized desk. His eyes are fixed to Aizawa\u2019s face. Aizawa is not looking at All Might.</p>\n<p>Aizawa talks to them in that no-nonsense, even tone and answers any questions they may have. He doesn\u2019t scold Shinsou when he asks the same question twice, just repeats the answer a second time. He doesn\u2019t remind Izuku to pay attention when he stares out the window, staring at nothing, like he might do if Izuku zoned out in class.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Aizawa pushes away from the desk, and says, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Go back to your dorms. Keep your mouths shut and if you have any questions or problems, you know where to find me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The students scramble out of their seats and head to the door. Kacchan is the first one to leave, almost jogging out into the hall, but Izuku lags back. All Might is still sitting in that too-small desk.</p>\n<p>All Might spreads his hands over the wood. His hands are so big that his spread fingers span the full width of the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa,\u201d All Might says. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa sighs. \u201cYes, I suppose we have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku slips silently out of the classroom after his friends. He doesn\u2019t wait in the hallway for All Might. The two men have decades-old secrets to unravel. It could take a while.</p>\n<p>Izuku has his own conversation to have, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they return to the dorms, their classmates stare at them. Jirou and Kirishima are there, too. Uraraka stares at them. She\u2019s pink in the face and looks like she\u2019s going to burst. Izuku barely blinks at them. Kacchan seems unconcerned, too. Months of staring into the teenage faces of his childhood friends makes you immune to this kind of thing.</p>\n<p>Kirishima is pulling the lid off the blender and pouring the smoothy into cups. When Kacchan slides up to him, mouth pursed into a line, Kirishima hands him a glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cWhere were you guys? You missed lunch and all the afternoon classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNowhere,\u201d Uraraka squeaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku and I got into a fight,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cUraraka got dragged into it. We were getting bitched out by the teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem injured,\u201d Kaminari says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that kind of a fight,\u201d Izuku says. Kacchan grunts as if agreeing, and that seems to satisfy their curious classmates.</p>\n<p>Jirou looks up from her phone and squints at Uraraka. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that expression?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat expression?\u201d Uraraka says, too loud and high-pitched to be anything other than suspicious.</p>\n<p>Kacchan snorts and heads for the stairs. Izuku hangs back for a few minutes, if only to make sure Uraraka is holding up okay, and isn't going to immediately blurt out the real reason they were missing from class.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s still pink, and visibly nervous, but doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s going to start shouting about time travel. Izuku excuses himself and heads upstairs. He collects his hero journal\u2014the old, battered copy he started when he was five\u2014and then heads back out again.</p>\n<p>He raps his knuckles on the closed dorm room. \u201cKacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Kacchan calls from within.</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen the door, Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said fuck off!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to open the door, but it\u2019s locked. He sighs. \u201cOne last chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking deaf? I said\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku yanks the doorknob sharply to the left. The lock snaps. He pulls the doorknob towards the ground and, with a final crunch, it falls into two pieces.</p>\n<p>Izuku pushes the door open. Kacchan is pushed against the far side of his bed, arms crossed over his chest. He doesn\u2019t look surprised to see Izuku break into his room.</p>\n<p>Izuku knocks on the door. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>This finally sets Kacchan off. He shoves up from the bed and paces like a wild animal confined to a cell. \u201cYou just barged right in, don\u2019t fucking ask that as if\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a seat on the edge of the bed, journal tucked in his lap. He\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s feeling. He hasn\u2019t been sure all day.</p>\n<p>Kacchan stops pacing. His eyes flick down to the journal. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw them.\u201d Izuku stands up and pushes the journal into Kacchan\u2019s hands. \u201cYou were rescued by our friends too, right, Kacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, Kacchan flips open the journal. This isn\u2019t the first time Kacchan has seen these drawings. He\u2019s seen Izuku sketching his friends in class, or lugging around his journal to and from class, or, when they were very young, babbling to the teacher about the heroes that saved him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw them,\u201d Izuku says again. \u201cYou used to make fun of me for having \u2018imaginary friends\u2019 but you met them, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all of them,\u201d Kacchan says. He sounds tired. It\u2019s been an exhausting day for them both. \u201cI did think they were imaginary friends at first. Sounds like something you\u2019d do. But then I saw your drawing of Rocky, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRocky?\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>Kacchan glowers at him. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell me their names, okay? I had to come up with something to call them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan gave them names, too. All these years, Kacchan has been turning the same mystery over in his head. All this time, and Izuku has had no idea.</p>\n<p>Izuku expects Kacchan to fight him through this entire conversation, but Kacchan flicks through the journal carefully, and says, \u201cHow many did you meet in total?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNineteen,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNineteen,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cAre you bullshitting me right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan flicks back through the journal, his lip upturned. He settles on a page near the beginning. Alien Queen,\u00a0Electro, and Tape-Man are cramped together over a two-page spread. Izuku drew Alien Queen holding up a peace sign. It seemed in-character for her. Kacchan\u2019s thumb grazes over Electro's smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did they tell you?\u201d Izuku asks. Did Kacchan know that his childhood friends were future classmates before Izuku did? Were they as secretive with him as they were with Izuku?</p>\n<p>\u201cThey told me to stop acting like such a little\u2014\u201d Kacchan looks at Izuku and then away, his lips pursed like he\u2019s sucked on a lemon. \u201cWhatever. You\u2019re missing one, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI record every hero I run into.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the hero with the mask and weird bunny ears. The strongest one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t remember a hero like that. How has Kacchan met a hero that he doesn\u2019t know?</p>\n<p>Something floods Izuku\u2019s throat. It tastes like bile and bursts behind his eyes like firewords\u2014a realisation. It burns.</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows down the hot feeling. \u201cYou mean \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan scoffs, turning away so he doesn\u2019t have to meet Izuku\u2019s eyes. He keeps flicking through the journal until he finds Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u201cI met Kirishima and his still shitty hair,\u201d Kacchan says, \u201cand Jirou and her still shitty attitude, and the three other shitty losers\u2014Kaminari, Ashido, and Sero. And\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan has remembered four of their classmates names, something he has never done before. That\u2019s the least important part of what Kacchan just said, but it sticks in Izuku\u2019s head, nonetheless.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t meet everyone, then? Just, uh, the five of them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you fucking count?\u201d Kacchan glowers at something over Izuku\u2019s head, rather than look Izuku in the eye. \u201cI met\u00a0six heroes. The\u00a0five chuckleheads and \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku waits for Kacchan to finish his sentence. He doesn\u2019t. Izuku isn\u2019t used to this walled up Kacchan. The Kacchan he knows either blasts him back or shouts out his feelings until his throat is torn up.. He doesn\u2019t look get this look on his face\u2014this strange, pinched look\u2014and choke out each sentence, like every word is wrenched painfully from somewhere in his chest. He doesn\u2019t blush pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Izuku prompts.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Kacchan spits, scrubbing at his cheeks, \u201cyou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s thoughts stutter to a halt.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were taller, and your hair and face were hidden by a mask, and you tried not to speak too much. Guess you thought it\u2019d give you away immediately if you blabbed on and on.\u201d Kacchan runs a hand through his hair. He\u2019s still not looking directly at Izuku. \u201cBut there was always something about that hero that I couldn\u2019t put my finger on. Until we came here. As soon as I saw that ugly fucking suit you chose as your costume, I knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Months ago, while Izuku\u2019s mind was unravelling at the sight of their entire class decked out in familiar costume, Kacchan was watching him, looking over his suit, and having a similar revelation. Izuku hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw you, too,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYou were wearing a bike helmet, but the grenades, the colouring\u2014it was your hero suit. I should have known when I saw the hero use explosions, or when he took on a group of villains without breaking a sweat or flinching or even hesitating, like he knew there was no doubt that he was going to win, but \u2026 it still took years to figure it all out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku feels a little stupid, now. He\u2019d spent years trying to solve this mystery, when all this time, one of his childhood heroes had been living across the street from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe? You saw\u2014\u201d Kacchan\u2019s hand clenches and unclenches at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were with Red\u2014uh, I mean, with Kirishima. You seemed close. Very close.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were by yourself,\u201d Kacchan says.</p>\n<p>Izuku fiddles with the hem of his shirt. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any friends with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan sneers at him. \u201cSometimes, sure, but the green hero didn\u2019t <em>need</em> anyone else to win. That was the way it was. He was stronger than the others, and he could win against anyone else he came across, and he could do it all without dropping that dumb smile. Like All Might.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knot in Izuku\u2019s throat. \u201cI thought you said you couldn\u2019t see his face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could see the edges of it through the mask, and I could <em>hear</em> it when he spoke. Fuck. I should\u2019ve figured it out sooner. He sounded nervous, even after taking down half a dozen villains on his own, but he was still so fucking <em>chipper</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku knows Kacchan. He knows that he admires All Might like Izuku. He knows he\u2019s a diehard hero fan, even if he never enjoyed conventions and fan forums like Izuku. And he knows what Kacchan sounds like when he talks about someone he respects.</p>\n<p>Kacchan respects the green hero that saved him\u2014the hero that Izuku will become.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe green hero wasn\u2019t alone because he <em>had</em> to be,\u201d Kacchan continues. \u201cHe was determined. He was so fucking stubborn. And he never lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence fills the room. Kacchan glowers down at the journal in his hand. Izuku thinks Kacchan will destroy it, the way he destroyed more than one of Izuku\u2019s journals full of hero analysis, but Kacchan throws the journal back at him. Izuku fumbles to catch it. He almost doesn\u2019t hear Kacchan when he says, \u201cI have one, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares down at the journal, open to a drawing Izuku did when he was eight years old. Iida\u2019s boxy face stares up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a journal, too?\u201d Izuku says. \u201cOf us? You drew us? Can I see\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan\u2019s patience is gone. He throws himself onto his chair, skidding back until he bumps against his desk, and glares up at Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out of my room unless you want to leave in pieces.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku has already gotten more than he was ever expecting from this conversation. He spills on his heel, dodging a broken half of the doorknob.</p>\n<p>Before he can slip out of the door, Kacchan says, \u201cDeku.\u201d Izuku peeks at him over his shoulder. Kacchan\u2019s stare bores into him. \u201cYou better make sure that I meet Persevere again. Don\u2019t fuck up.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Persevere</em>.</p>\n<p>Izuku squints at him. \u201cYou named Kirishima Rocky, but I got a name as cool as Persevere? Kacchan, I\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan hurls a pillow at him. Izuku blocks it with his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t fucking tell you,\u201d Kacchan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must have been older when we first met, if you gave me a name like Persevere.\u201d Kacchan wrenches his gaze away from him. Izuku can\u2019t help the smirk that grows on his lips. \u201cUnless we did meet when you were little, and you called me <em>something else\u2014\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Kacchan throws another pillow at him. It hits Izuku in the stomach. A laugh bubbles up Izuku\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>He can name the feeling that sits in his chest, now: relief. A great weight has been taken off his shoulders. This isn\u2019t just Izuku\u2019s secret anymore. It never was, really.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet our friends again,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cWe\u2019ve already met them again, technically, and this time, we don\u2019t have to let them go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking mushy,\u201d Kacchan grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime you need to talk\u2014\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out of my room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014you know where to find me. See you in class, Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tips one last smile at Kacchan and slips out of his room. In the stairwell, he can hear Uraraka\u2019s nervous laughter float up the stairs. She sounds vaguely unhinged. Izuku knows that feeling all too well.</p>\n<p>When Izuku gets back to his room, he jots down everything Kacchan said, and then he flips to a fresh page and starts a new entry.</p>\n<p><em>Alias: Persevere,</em> he writes across the top of the page.<em> Real name: Deku. Quirk: One for All.</em></p>\n<p>He sits back and takes in the way the names look together. Persevere. Deku. Both names mean the same thing.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s face hurts. He reaches up to touch his mouth and pokes around the edge of his grin. It feels too wide for his face. Izuku hadn\u2019t even realised he was smiling.</p>\n<p>Relief. This feeling, warm like sunshine, that\u2019s taken route in his chest\u2014it\u2019s <em>relief</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might doesn\u2019t announce to the class that Izuku is invited to have lunch or coffee in the teachers lounge semi-regularly, but he thinks they know. When All Might sticks his head around the corner and wordlessly holds up his lunch, Uraraka and Iida don\u2019t even blink (though Todoroki does squint at Izuku for a moment, as though weighing him up, before turning back to his conversation with Shinsou).</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you in class, ribbit,\u201d Asui says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe All Might wasn\u2019t talking to me. Maybe that was meant for someone else,\u201d Izuku mumbles, even as he picks up his lunch tray. They all level him unimpressed looks. Izuku goes red and half-jogs out of the cafeteria.</p>\n<p>Izuku settles down on the couch across from All Might and picks his chop sticks back up. He reminds himself to return the tray to the cafeteria before class resumes. Last time, he forgot, and carried the tray into English class.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow have you been, my boy?\u201d All Might asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. Izuku squints at All Might. \u201cHow have <em>you</em> been?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, I suppose.\u201d All Might fiddles with his small container of strawberries. \u201cThis past week has been eye-opening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku puts down his chopsticks. He has been wondering if All Might would want to talk about the time travel incident a few days ago. \u201cAll Might \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou amaze me, young Midoriya,\u201d All Might says. \u201cWhen you were a child, you knew immediately that there was something different about the heroes that saved you. When I was a child, I dismissed my run-ins with heroes as coincidence. It\u2019s been decades and I\u2019m only now learning the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou grew up with time travellers, too,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cand one of them was Aizawa.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might blows out a long breath that makes his bangs float up to his forehead. \u201cYes. I hadn\u2019t realised until this week, but\u2014yes. The strange masked heroes I encountered when I was a kid were time travellers. One of them was Aizawa. I should have realised. One of them used their quirk-nullifying power in front of me and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to picture Aizawa taking a young All Might out for milkshakes, the way his heroes occasionally did. He tries to imagine a young, naive All Might sitting across from Aizawa and pestering him with all kinds of questions about who he is and where he came from. The resulting image resembles a blond puppy harassing an adult cat too much for Izuku to keep a straight face. He takes a bite of egg to hide his smile.</p>\n<p>All Might catches Izuku\u2019s smile, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You can laugh at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI mean, it makes sense that you didn\u2019t figure it out. My heroes didn\u2019t wear masks. They wore their regular hero costumes. Some of them even told me their hero names. And then I started up at high school and I spent all day, every day, in class with them, looking at their familiar faces and familiar quirks and familiar mannerisms. I would have been blind not to have noticed it. It was harder for you.\u201d Izuku scrubs a hand through his hair, embarrassed. \u201cI can understand why Aizawa was annoyed. They didn\u2019t even try and disguise themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa does value stealth,\u201d All Might agrees.</p>\n<p>All Might talks about his childhood heroes, and although he didn\u2019t spend the same kind of time with them as Izuku did, he can tell hear the undercurrent of fondness in All Might\u2019s words. There\u2019s regret, too. Izuku wonders if All Might wishes he had chased after the mysterious heroes, pestered them a little more, rather than taken things at face value. If All Might wishes he had the same relationship that Izuku has with his friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was lonely,\u201d Izuku says in a lull in the conversation. \u201cThere was definitely fun moments, and I\u2019m grateful that I got to meet them all, but it was lonely sometimes, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa wasn\u2019t the only person that saved me,\u201d All Might says. \u201cNight-Eye volunteered, too. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t get the chance to thank him before\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might cuts himself off. He sets his fruit down on the low coffee table. Izuku lowers his chopsticks, too. He doesn\u2019t think either of them will be able to eat again during the lunch break.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku starts.</p>\n<p>All Might shakes his head. He doesn\u2019t say <em>it\u2019s alright,</em> because it\u2019s not. A hero\u2014a friend\u2014is gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew him,\u201d All Might says. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for that chance, at least. Aizawa passed on the contacts for some of the other heroes who saved me, too. I\u2019m going to try and get to know them before it\u2019s too late. Even if too much time has passed, even if they don\u2019t want to be friends, it would be wrong not to thank them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Civilians don\u2019t always thank their heroes. It\u2019s not a selfless act, after all. Heroism is a job. Some people doesn\u2019t believe it requires a thank you, the way people don\u2019t thank paramedics for driving them to the hospital, or firefighters for putting out bush-fires, or teachers for carrying them through years of schooling. This feels different, somehow.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI hope you find them.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might smiles. He looks tired, like he\u2019s had trouble sleeping again, but his eyes crinkle up, and his teeth show, and some of the anxious energy fizzles out in Izuku\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d All Might says. \u201cI hope so, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His classmates are gathered around the common room sofas. Homework is spread out in a semi-circle on the carpet. Hagakure is arguing with Jirou about the volume of the TV and proper places to do homework.</p>\n<p>Todoroki is folded up in the armchair and scrolling through his phone like he\u2019s deaf to the argument unravelling at his feet. Izuku hovers behind him, shifting from foot to foot. Todoroki looks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright, Midoriya?\u201d Todoroki asks.</p>\n<p>Kirishima rolls onto his back, squashing his English homework under his shoulders. \u201cDude, come study with us!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jirou picks up a throw cushion like she\u2019s going to ditch it at Kirishima. \u201cI said to go do your homework at the table. Not in front of the TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s comfy here,\u201d Hagakure says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t complain when people want to watch TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too loud. I\u2019m sitting right next to the speaker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen <em>move</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka puts down her phone and sits up. \u201cIs everything okay, Deku?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice comes out as a squeak. He rocks back on his heels, hands twisting and untwisting in front of him.</p>\n<p>Everyone\u2019s attention shifts from Hagakure and Jirou\u2019s argument to Izuku. Todoroki shifts as though to stand and force Izuku into his armchair, but Izuku pushes him back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay. I just\u2014I wanted to say\u2014\u201d Izuku makes himself stand flat-footed on the carpet. He straightens his shoulders. \u201cI want to say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His classmates blink up at him. Even the few people at the table behind the couches are watching, now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dude,\u201d Kirishima says, \u201cbut \u2026 what did we do exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were there,\u201d Izuku says. He briefly makes eye contact with Uraraka, and then looks away. Kacchan isn\u2019t here right now. Uraraka is the only person here who could guess why Izuku is thanking this group of people, and even then, she can\u2019t understand. Not really. Not at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay, Midoriya?\u201d Ojiro asks from his place at the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sounds awfully troubling,\u201d Tokoyami agrees. \u201cAre you dying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Midoriya is not dying,\u201d Iida says. Then pauses. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying or planning on a suicide mission, are you, Midoriya?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better not,\u201d Jirou says. She looks as though she\u2019s going to hurl the throw cushion at him, now.</p>\n<p>Izuku flails his arms in the arm. \u201cNo, no! I\u2019m not dying! I\u2019m just thanking you for\u2014for everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds like a goodbye message,\u201d Todoroki says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a goodbye message!\u201d Izuku huffs out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m just \u2026 grateful to have you all in my life. For being my friends. For saving me. For sticking with me when things got tough. Thank you. I wanted to say that at least once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima rolls off the carpet and sweeps Izuku into a hug. \u201cThat was so manly.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he sets him back down, Uraraka bounces over for a hug, too. A few of the others get up for a turn, like Iida, and Aoyama, and even Todoroki, who gives Izuku the briefest hug possible, and then turns away before either of them can see each other\u2019s pink faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely not dying?\u201d Jirou says, still holding up the throw cushion menacingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>She lowers the cushion, and then eyes him up and down, as though looking him over for any sign of injury. She\u2019s a teenager, now, not that adult pro hero who was always a moment away from scrubbing her knuckles against his scalp, but she still gives off older sister vibes.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cSit down and watch Robot Wars with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m doing homework!\u201d Hakagure says, but Jirou just drags Izuku down so he\u2019s wedged between her and Uraraka, and turns the volume up as loud as it will go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their first year is almost over. Izuku is older now than he was eighteen months ago. He\u2019s a different person. He\u2019s done more; he\u2019s seen more; he knows more.</p>\n<p>He approaches Aizawa after the final bell rings on the second last Saturday of semester. His classmates run out of the room as fast as they can. Izuku waves off Uraraka and Todoroki when they try to wait around for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will only take a minute,\u201d he tells them.</p>\n<p>Aizawa is already half inside of a pale pink sleeping bag. He raises an eyebrow at Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d Izuku begins, fidgeting with his hold on his backpack. \u201cDo you know if Shinsou will\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t discuss that with a student,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>Izuku wilts. \u201cRight. I had a feeling you would say that. But the year is almost over, and Shinsou still isn\u2019t in this class, and I keep thinking, what if \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to change the timeline.\u201d Aizawa pulls his sleeping bag off and folds it under one arm. Izuku straightens his shoulders under Aizawa\u2019s serious gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re already well on your way to making the future happen. When you said you\u2019d been affected by time travel, I knew you were going to be high-maintenance, but I hadn\u2019t that it\u2019d be to such a high degree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks. \u201cHigh-maintenance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEpisodes of time travel are rare, and it only happens to high profile cases. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone,\u201d Izuku begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Aizawa leans back against the desk, not because he\u2019s tired, but so that his eyes are level with his student\u2019s. \u201cTime travellers only come back in time because they think someone is worth killing or worth saving. Because that person has helped to shape the course of history and their death will warp the future drastically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Aizawa puts a hand on Izuku\u2019s shoulder. He doesn\u2019t do that often. \u201cMidoriya, you had nineteen pro heroes save your life. You said many of them appeared more than once. Do you know how many attempted assassinations you experienced?\u201d</p>\n<p>Attempted assassinations. Izuku had only called them villain run-ins. Not assassinations. Never that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI lost count after thirty,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOver thirty,\u201d Aizawa repeats. \u201cProbably more. I\u2019ve heard of top heroes experiencing attempted assassinations as a child, but it was never more than two or three times. Maybe half a dozen if they were at the very top of the ranks. Not thirty separate occasions. That is why I knew you were going to be high-maintenance. The best heroes always are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku balls his hands into fists. He\u2019s been asking <em>why me</em> for years. He\u2019s wondered what his friends were keeping from him, how they kept finding him, why they would look at him with such familiar fondness, but not once did he count out the frequency of the villain attacks and equate it his own importance.</p>\n<p>Izuku almost asks how many experiences with time travel All Might had, but his tongue is stuck to the roof of his mouth.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t get the words out, but Aizawa knows what\u2019s thinking, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom memory, All Might had twenty-eight cases of malicious time travel,\u201d Aizawa says.</p>\n<p>Twenty-eight. And Izuku had thirty\u2014had lost count after thirty when he was eleven.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d is all Izuku manages.</p>\n<p>Aizawa stands back up and scrubs a hand through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much this year. You\u2019re on your way to becoming the man that sent villains running into the past to take you out before you became too strong to fight\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe villains stopped becoming when I as fourteen,\u201d Izuku realises. \u201cI thought\u2014I don\u2019t know. I thought everything was coming full circle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re all cowards who couldn\u2019t face you as an adult, so they went back to fight you as a kid. The things you\u2019ve done in your first year at UA\u2014they\u2019ll know about that, if they\u2019re digging into your past. They wouldn\u2019t risk facing you within a year of those events.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares out at the rows of empty desks. For months, he had been picturing his classmates growing old beside him, becoming the heroes he had met as a kid. He hadn\u2019t thought about the future, when friends and villains would be doing that in reverse. Researching him. Seeing the younger Izuku after getting to know the older version of him, the hero Deku, either as his friend or his enemy.</p>\n<p>Izuku scrubs at his face. \u201cSir, I came here to ask about Shinsou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa throws his sleeping back over his shoulder and heads for the door. \u201cYou\u2019re the eye of the storm. If you stay on course, everyone else should, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>It should be an overwhelming thought. Having so much influence on the future should frighten him, but\u2014Izuku was written into history the moment All Might extended his hand and asked him to inherit his power. He will do this because of the dream burning up inside him. He will do it for All Might. He will do it for himself. Maintaining the timeline is a perk.</p>\n<p>Aizawa stops in the doorway. \u201cShinsou\u2019s transfer will go through over the summer. Don\u2019t tell anyone. Not even Shinsou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku can\u2019t stop his smile. It feels too big for his face. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa nods, just the once, and disappears into the building, leaving Izuku in the classroom alone.</p>\n<p>Through the windows, he can see his friends racing to the dorms to get a head start on the weekend. He can see the entire campus from this angle, lit by the afternoon sun. He can see his future like a road map, spread out in front of him, boundless and full. He feels dizzy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good feeling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku wakes to a haze of colour. He squints and it coalesces into a rainbow of bouquets and cards and stuffed animals. Twelve years after entering UA, waking up in the hospital doesn\u2019t alarm him, but the emptiness of his room does. The vacant seats by his bed are more confusing than the blank space where his memory should be.</p>\n<p>People don\u2019t always flock to his bedside when he\u2019s wounded. In his line of work, injuries are an occupational hazard, something most of friends and family face almost daily. But judging from the piles of gifts, the wilting flowers, Izuku has been in the hospital a while. Days. Maybe longer. He wasn\u2019t just knocked around; whatever happened was serious.</p>\n<p>The pain and wooziness keeps him from moving for a half hour, and then curiosity wins out.</p>\n<p>Izuku expertly pulls out the IV and pushes himself off the bed. His right side\u2014from his ankle up to his collarbone\u2014is splotched with deep purple bruises. There\u2019s a soft cast on his ankle. When he looks in the mirror later that afternoon, he\u2019ll find two neat rows of stitches across his temple and jaw.</p>\n<p>He limps into the corridor. He doesn\u2019t make it far before a nurse stops him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku, sir,\u201d she says, caught between flustered hero worship and professionalism. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up. You\u2019ve been unconscious for several days and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Izuku is polite, but he has no intention of placidly laying back down and going back to sleep. \u201cDo you know where my phone is? I need to contact my agency.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you really need to let a doctor examine you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m alright\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about my friends and family. I need to speak with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku pulls out the toothy smile he wears in front of panicked civilians, reporters, and nervous fans. That famous smile that says, <em>It\u2019s okay now.</em> If Todoroki were here, he would call Izuku manipulative.</p>\n<p>But Todoroki isn\u2019t here. There\u2019s no evidence in his hospital room that Todoroki or his friends have been here at all. No stray jackets or shoes, no paper coffee cups or sandwich wrappers left in the bin, no spare pillows or blankets on the chairs. That\u2019s not normal. That has Izuku worried.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d the nurse says, like she\u2019s been punched in the gut. She blinks rapidly. \u201cYes, of course. I\u2019ll go have a look for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Izuku had tried to bluff with just a smile more than five years ago, back before he reached Number One, he\u2019d be quickly manhandled back into bed. But he\u2019s an old hat at this now.</p>\n<p>Some of the sturdier medical staff won\u2019t be swayed by his reassuring smile, though. If he runs into anyone like that, they will browbeat him back into bed like he is any other patient and not the Symbol of Peace.</p>\n<p>The nurse returns with his phone. There\u2019s a crack running down the middle of the screen, but it turns on. There are over fifty messages waiting for him\u2014from his mum and All Might, from coworkers and other acquaintances in the hero industry, all of them wishing him a speedy recovery. Old emails. Polite enquiries from reporters who should know better than to contact him on his personal phone.</p>\n<p>There are no messages from his friends. The group chat for the old Class 3-A is silent. The last message, a meme that features Kacchan squinting at Kirishima\u2019s bright smile, sent by Kaminari, came over a week ago.</p>\n<p>Something is very wrong.</p>\n<p>He thinks about calling his mum, but he doesn\u2019t like her seeing him when he is so injured, even after all these years. And if he calls his agency, they\u2019ll tell him to stay where he is and recover fully, and that\u2019s not an option.</p>\n<p>He calls his sidekick instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bubblegum Blitz pulls into the car-park in a sleek agency car. Izuku slides into the passenger seat and they speed off before anyone can try and follow up with his hasty discharge.</p>\n<p>Bubblegum has worked with Izuku since they were eighteen, fresh out of UA and still harbouring a devastating crush on the newly minted Number One. Thankfully, the crush eroded over time, but their petulance for indulging all of Izuku\u2019s whims stays. They\u2019re the only sidekick willing to bust him out of the hospital instead of escorting him back to bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cGum,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cwhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bubblegum says, pink fingers twitching around the steering wheel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from my friends in weeks, Gum. That\u2019s not normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me be involved,\u201d Bubblegum says, pulling at their fringe. It bounces back when they let go, like rubber. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, but I know they\u2019re helping you, so I\u2019ve been assisting on the outside. Helping them explain their absences. Stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInvolved in what?\u201d Izuku asks, a pit growing in his stomach.</p>\n<p>Bubblegum is quiet as they drive. They stop in front of an apartment building in a suburb that sits between the city centre and the outer suburbs. A place away from business districts and families and schools. A place heroes could come and go freely without being questioned.</p>\n<p>Izuku peers up at the brick building. Some of the windows are lit. Some are boarded up with cardboard or thin wood sheets.</p>\n<p>\u201cBubblegum?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>Bubblegum lets out a deep breath. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there when you were attacked. I\u2019m your sidekick--I\u2019m supposed to help and protect you, but I wasn\u2019t even there. I tried to help Mind Blank with the arrest after you were hospitalised, but some of the villains got away. And then your friends came here. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p>\n<p>Class 3-A have been accused of being too insular before. The hero industry is small and self-contained, and their group of twenty are even more so. But to purposely shut out Izuku\u2019s sidekick \u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Bubblegum says, an unreadable look on their face, \u201cthat they\u2019re doing something they aren\u2019t supposed to, something not exactly legal, and they didn\u2019t know if they could trust me with that secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething like?\u201d Izuku presses. When Bubblegum just shrugs, Izuku leans forward, ignoring the pain in his ribs. \u201cGum, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to protect you,\u201d Bubblegum says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019m sure\u2014I\u2019m positive that what they\u2019re doing is to save you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku thinks Bubblegum knows more about what his ex-classmates are doing than they will admit, which doesn\u2019t bode well. They would only pretend to be this ignorant if his friends were doing something very dangerous and very illegal.</p>\n<p>Izuku opens the car-door and staggers out. He\u2019s limping into the building before Bubblegum can stop him.</p>\n<p>Izuku takes the elevator to the top floor. Shinsou would rent a room closer to the middle to be less conspicuous, but Yaoyorozu would take up the entire top floor without even thinking about it, and out of the two of them, Yaoyorozu is the more likely to find them a base as tactically perfect as this.</p>\n<p>The elevator rattles to a stop. Izuku steps out.</p>\n<p>He thinks he knows what this is. He knows where he\u2019s arrived\u2014when he\u2019s arrived. He thinks he knew it instinctually the moment he opened his eyes and found himself alone in a flower-filled hospital room.</p>\n<p>More than once, Izuku had thought he had reached the right time and had been disappointed. But everything about today has been odd\u2014the strange, out of the way building; Bubblegum Blitz\u2019s crypticism; and the silence surrounding this entire case, from the media in regards to the villains that escaped Mind Blank\u2019s raid days after Izuku was hospitalised, to the lack of messages from his friends. Izuku knows that, when things stop adding up, it often means that his childhood friends are involved</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a moment just to breathe, to brace himself, and then opens the only door not thinly coated in dust.</p>\n<p>The large living room is unfurnished, aside from a handful of unmade futons, several messy duffle-bags that look as though people have been living out of them, and a garbage bag full of empty take-away containers.</p>\n<p>A group of four are sat cross-legged in the middle of the room. Ingenium\u2019s dirt-streaked armour is scattered in pieces. Iida is attacking the chest plate with a scrub brush. The helmet is balanced in Ashido\u2019s lap and she\u2019s trying to chip off dried mud from around the eyes. Kacchan and Sato sit on Iida\u2019s left. Sato is half-way through a sandwich. Kacchan is eating healthy wheat chips by the handful.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just after noon, but it looks like a scene plucked right out of his hero agency in the early hours of the morning, when everyone is dusty and bone-tired and starving, just coming off nighttime patrol.</p>\n<p>Izuku leans against the door, biting down his smile, and thinks, It\u2019s them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already have a hero agency, Iida,\u201d Izuku says lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re trying to set up a second one.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all look up. Sato drops his sandwich. Kacchan shoves another handful of chips into his mouth, unbothered.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya!\u201d Ashido scrambles to her feet. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Iida drops his chest plate and leaps over the rest of his armour, almost tripping on a glove, and scoops Izuku into a hug. Izuku winces and Iida quickly lets go.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright? You should still be in the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Izuku says, letting Ashido give him a brief, careful hug. \u201cNow, tell me: what happened? What is this place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ashido\u2019s eyes go wide. Iida stiffens up like he\u2019s fifteen years old again and desperate to prove himself, and Sato finds the ceiling suddenly fascinating.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ashido says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in an unfurnished apartment in your hero costumes in the middle of a weekday for no reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Ashido says. \u201cWell.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all look so tired and frantic, running on too little sleep and too much caffeine, and Izuku almost feels bad. And then he remembers a hundred fruitless google searches coming up with nothing; his friends vanishing around street corners as though they had never been there; the way they\u2019d tussle his hair and laugh off his questions, plying him with ice-creams instead of answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did something,\u201d Iida begins. \u201cWe did something we maybe shouldn\u2019t have done, but I think I speak for everyone when I say we don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething illegal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t exactly go through the proper channels,\u201d Sato says. \u201cNo one knows what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what is it,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cthat you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan crunches loudly on a wheat chip. The bag crinkles obnoxiously.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another long silence as everyone tries to think about how to say what they\u2019re about to say, before Ashido blurts, \u201cWe\u2019re time travellers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can explain,\u201d Iida says quickly, shooting Ashido a look. \u201cWe did it to protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And now, the question Izuku has been waiting to ask: \u201cWhy did you need to protect me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou was investigating a group of villains,\u201d Iida starts, \u201cwith a serious grudge against the hero industry\u2014but especially you, Midoriya, as our Symbol. One of them used to be a runner for the old League of Villains. He has a time quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku remembers this vaguely. Not the middle-aged man with the time quirk, but the villains banded together by their individual hatred towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey attacked me,\u201d Izuku recalls.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were kind of a boss, dude,\u201d Sato says, like he thinks Izuku\u2019s main concern is whether or not he looked cool while fighting the villains off. \u201cYou took most of them down, even if they did deal enough damage to land you in the hospital for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou helped organise a raid a few days later, but we didn\u2019t get them all. Redo\u2014the runner with the time quirk\u2014escaped but he left his plans behinds. Maps of your old neighbourhood, photos of you and Bakugou as children, your old elementary and middle school. We worked out fairly quickly that he was planning on sending people back in time to take you out and destabilise the entire hero industry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the villains aren\u2019t the only ones who have a time quirk on their side,\u201d Ashido says. \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t find Redo before he started sending people back to hurt you, so we decided we\u2019d meet them there and cut them off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were hurt. You hadn\u2019t even woken up yet\u2014there was no time to ask you what you thought of this or ask your permission,\u201d Iida says in a rush. \u201cBut\u2014we couldn\u2019t just let him <em>kill</em> you, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ashido peers at him, trying to gauge his lack of reaction. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be more freaked out by this, Midoriya? We\u2019re<em> time travellers,</em> now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cI\u2019ve always known that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They blink at him. Through a mouthful of chips, Kacchan says, \u201cYou\u2019re fucking morons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean you <em>know?\u201d</em> Ashido demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean I <em>know</em>,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI\u2019ve known my whole life, way before I met you at UA, before the villains even had the idea to go back in time. You\u2019re my childhood heroes. Of course I know who you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ashido\u2019s mouth opens and closes. Iida closes his eyes like he\u2019s in pain. Sato puts his face in his hands and says, \u201cBakugou\u2019s right. We\u2019re morons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did we forget that time travel works both ways?\u201d Iida asks no one in particular.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think everyone\u2019s been too busy stressing over the thought of baby Midoriya getting murdered,\u201d Sato says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a baby,\u201d Izuku says indignantly, \u201cI was about nine when I met you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sato stares at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sent back yet. Nine, really?\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re not finished. Izuku hadn\u2019t expected that when he finally caught up to his childhood friends they would only be half-way done saving him.</p>\n<p>Izuku cocks his head to one side, remembering the way he\u2019d launched himself at Sato and clung, koala-like, to his shoulders. \u201cNevermind, then. You\u2019ll see soon enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iida puts a hand on his shoulder and they share a smile, something secret and strained like the smiles exchanged on the battlefield. Kacchan rolls his eyes and leaves, going deeper into the apartment.</p>\n<p>Sato keeps staring at Izuku like he\u2019s a math problem he can\u2019t figure out, which makes Ashido laugh and rock back on her heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess who\u2019s back!\u201d she calls, loud enough to echo through the closed side-rooms.</p>\n<p>Kaminari comes out first, still in his pyjamas, his hair puffed out around his head like a dandelion. He sees Izuku and makes a choked noise, half-cough, half-scream, and throws himself at him. He scrambles to steady Kaminari before he topples over.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Kaminari says, \u201cyou were such a cute kid. My heart can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hagakure and Ojirou come running out when they hear Kaminari\u2019s scream. Hagakure is brandishing a live taser, but she drops it when she sees Izuku. She shoves past Ojirou and jumps on top of Izuku, almost smashing into Kaminari.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku! Honey, you were so cute,\u201d she says with a squeal. Izuku winces and readjusts his two friends so that there are no elbows shoved against his damaged ribs.</p>\n<p>Ojirou stares at Izuku. \u201cYou got tall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really not that tall,\u201d Izuku admits. He\u2019s average. Barely. At red carpet events and official photo-shoots, he tries to duck away from the giants in their class like Shoji so he doesn\u2019t look even smaller than he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you were so little,\u201d Ojirou says with wonder.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya, you used to be <em>so small,\u201d</em> Kaminari says, and he sounds like he might start crying.</p>\n<p>Aoyama comes into the room next, his hair spotted white where his dry shampoo wasn\u2019t entirely brushed out, foundation shiny under the apartment\u2019s lights. Aoyama is not normally one for physical affection\u2014he prefers to exchange blinding smiles and over exaggerated poses from across the way\u2014but he jogs across the unfurnished living area and jumps onto Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cMon ami, you are so smart! So brave! A bright little star!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to untangle himself from the three bodies. They reluctantly pull away, and step back to give him some room, but then another wave of friends burst into the living room.</p>\n<p>Kirishima and Sero almost barrel him over with the force of their hug. In contrast, Todoroki\u2019s hug is achingly gentle. His unwashed hair is fraying out of its braid, but Izuku can still smell the phantom-scent of his apple shampoo.</p>\n<p>When Todoroki pulls away, Izuku glimpses Shinsou flipping him off in the doorway. Uraraka almost knocks Shinsou over when she sprints into the room, ink smudged down one side of her face from where she\u2019d fallen asleep on her notes. She launches herself at Izuku. He catches her around the knees and she clings, legs wrapped around his waist, keening into his hair.</p>\n<p>Everyone is staring at him like they can\u2019t believe he\u2019s real, like they\u2019re seeing him for the first time, and the combined weight of their gazes makes his stomach swoop.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says, even though he\u2019s been struggling to walk without listing to one side since he woke up, and he thinks some of his stitches might be in danger of coming loose. \u201cYou guys are making sure I\u2019m okay. Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to wake up in the hospital alone,\u201d Todoroki says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were pretty messed up after the attack,\u201d Sero says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course we knew.\u201d Shinsou is eating Kacchan\u2019s wheat chips, which he probably stole using his quirk. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through worse. There\u2019s no way you wouldn\u2019t pull through.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka jumps down and stumbles back. Her eyes are rimmed red. \u201cDeku, oh no. I didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hugs her again. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Floaty Girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>She makes a little noise in the back of her throat and sags against him. He looks at the rest of them over the top of her head. Their pale, exhausted faces shine back at him, familiar and nostalgic all at once.</p>\n<p>Izuku says, barely able to form the words, \u201cHello, again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone. Hello.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They end up gathered on the floor. Izuku is slumped against the wall, a futon under him, in deference to his injuries. Everyone gathers around him in a circle, even Kacchan.</p>\n<p>The person who has made all of this possible is asleep in a side-room. Izuku gets the sense that she\u2019s not very old, and she has been working endlessly for days to send Izuku\u2019s friends back in time. He desperately wants to meet her, but she deserves the chance to rest.</p>\n<p>And it gives his classmates time to embarrass him without worrying about ruining her impression of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were <em>adorable</em>,\u201d Hagakure gushes. He thinks she might be whacking Ojirou in her enthusiasm, but he can\u2019t tell. \u201cYou had these big chubby cheeks and your hair was so curly and just\u2014ah!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were very cute,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cVery pink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki laughs when Izuku blushes. He hopes Todoroki didn\u2019t work out that he had a hopeless crush on him when he was little, a crush that never really went away. He should be safe, he thinks. Todoroki seems oblivious to the fact that half of Japan is in love with him. Surely, he hasn\u2019t picked up on Izuku\u2019s feelings.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were so small,\u201d Uraraka says, \u201cand you didn\u2019t recognise me, and you didn\u2019t even have a quirk to defend yourself. You were so trusting. It was \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOverwhelming,\u201d Todoroki finishes. \u201cIt was overwhelming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought it was overwhelming?\u201d Izuku says. \u201cThe first time I walked into Class 1-A and saw you all, I thought I was losing my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo wonder you were so sweaty and weird those first few months,\u201d Kirishima says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think we messed with the timeline?\u201d Sero asks. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t time travelled, then Izuku wouldn\u2019t have been a complete mess the first semester at UA.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I would have still been a mess even without having a class full of time travellers,\u201d Izuku says. His friends all nod in agreement. He decides not to feel offended by this.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t let him stay there for long. Iida calls Bubblegum Blitz to drive him back to the hospital, and Shinsou goes to wake the person sleeping in the next room. They can\u2019t afford to take breaks for longer than a few hours.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here, working non-stop, have you?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this in shifts,\u201d Kirishima says, which explains the friends who are missing, off sleeping or patrolling or working to cover their upcoming absences. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty non-stop, and Iida tried to cover his agency\u2019s paperwork while he was here and got so overwhelmed that he almost missed his turn a few times\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima, I believe you\u2019re up next,\u201d Iida cuts in loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe almost got sent back in his pyjamas,\u201d Uraraka tells Izuku in a whisper.</p>\n<p>Iida crosses his arms, petulant. \u201cI managed to get my armour on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Izuku says, which makes Iida splutter. He keeps forgetting that adult Izuku has all of child Izuku\u2019s memories.</p>\n<p>Before they bustle him out of the door and into Bubblegum\u2019s waiting car, Izuku snags Kacchan by the sleeve. He has a familiar helmet balanced under one arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be here, too?\u201d Izuku asks, low enough that only Kacchan hears him. \u201cYou\u2019re also in danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re only here for you, you snowflake,\u201d Kacchan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust me? But then \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan shakes his head and shoves Izuku. He topples into Sato\u2019s arms, who grabs him around the waist and starts to haul him to the door. Uraraka watches the manhandling from where she\u2019s holding the door open.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll sort itself out,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cThe timeline always does. Don\u2019t be such a fucking worrywart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you soon, Deku,\u201d Uraraka says cheerily, before shutting the door in his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Izuku had imagined catching up to his childhood friends, he hadn\u2019t thought about the transitional period between then and now. In his mind, he had envisioned two separate versions of his friends: the young gaggle of students, brimming with potential, and the capable grown-up heroes who were skilled enough to travel through time and repeatedly save him.</p>\n<p>But no sudden change has overcome his friends. They don\u2019t look more grown up or skilled or serious than they had a few weeks ago. Izuku feels like he had when he woke up on his eighteenth birthday, finally an adult but feeling just as small and out of his depth as he had felt the day before.</p>\n<p>His friends had undergone a slow and constant change, so gradual that Izuku hadn\u2019t noticed it, because at the same time, he had been growing up alongside them.</p>\n<p>Izuku goes back to the hospital, cooperative for once, and even lets Bubblegum confiscate his phone (on Iida\u2019s orders). He couldn\u2019t get any work done, anyway; he has too much to think about.</p>\n<p>He stares up at the ceiling. Changing his own past would bring too many risks, but Izuku wishes he could go and visit that lonely quirkless boy who didn\u2019t understand why his only friends kept leaving him behind.</p>\n<p>He would hold his small hands, mottled with bruises, and say, <em>You\u2019ll be stronger than you could have ever imagined. They\u2019ll make you strong; and you\u2019ll make them strong.</em></p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re the missing piece,</em> he will say. <em>It was always you.</em></p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t interfere with his past. There\u2019s a part of him that still grieves for that misguided kid, and he feels torn between a strange kind of protectiveness and forgiveness and hatred for how small and helplessness and ignorant he had been\u2014but Izuku can\u2019t meddle in his own history.</p>\n<p>He has to let his friends do that for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first time in months, Izuku waits until his Doctor gives him the all clear before leaving the hospital. She almost seems surprised when she walks into his room a week after he had first woken up and finds him still there, waiting patiently for a check-up. Obviously, she\u2019s dealt with pro heroes before.</p>\n<p>He goes home after he\u2019s discharged and showers. He sheds his mangled hero costume, the clothes he had arrived at the hospital in, for an All Might hoodie and soft sweatpants, and then walks right back out again.</p>\n<p>He picks up a dozen hot drinks from a cafe a few blocks down from the rented apartment. The barista doesn\u2019t complain about the large order or the way Izuku stuffs handfuls of sugar packets into his hoodie pocket.</p>\n<p>After she has eased the trays of drinks into his arms, she pauses, caught between one moment and the next, and then blurts, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku is glad he forwent wearing a face mask. He smiles his Deku smile, and says, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe missed you,\u201d she blurts, quickly turning red. \u201cJapan misses you. Please know--our hopes are with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku remembers why he usually leaves the hospital as soon as he can. If he didn\u2019t think they would turn him away the moment he stepped into the lobby, he would already be at his hero agency.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes the rickety elevator up to the top floor. When he tries to walk into the apartment without knocking, Yaoyorozu almost decapitates him with her bo staff. Izuku ducks, the stack of trays clutched tightly to his chest. The bo staff whizzes through his curls.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Midoriya!\u201d Yaoyorozu drops the bo staff and helps him steady the drinks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought you were an intruder.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my fault. This is a secret base full of pro heroes; I should\u2019ve known better than to walk in without letting you know I was coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yaoyorozu takes a few trays from him and lets him inside the apartment. Jirou is sitting in front of a sprawl of notes, holding a cup of cold coffee. She looks moments away from hurling it at Izuku\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou absolute bastard,\u201d she tells him.</p>\n<p>Yaoyorozu puts the drinks down. \u201cKyouka, you could have told me he was behind the door! I could have seriously hurt him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jirou trades the cold coffee for a fresh cappuccino. \u201cHe deserves it after what he put us through. What were you thinking, Midoriya? Running at the villains as a weedy little preteen? You gave me a heart-attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku staggers and falls beside her, shakily placing the rest of the trays down. \u201cBut \u2026 do you mean \u2026 you were the hero I saw as a kid? You\u2019re a time traveller?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jirou uncurls her legs and kicks him. Izuku topples over, laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice try. I know time travel works both ways, I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jirou pilfers the sugar satchels from Izuku\u2019s pockets. She tears six open and pours them into her coffee while Yaoyorozu goes into the other room to tell everyone that he\u2019s arrived.</p>\n<p>Asui is there almost immediately, stepping over the drink trays and ducking under Izuku\u2019s arm. She wraps herself around him, like a snake draped over sun-soaked rock. He laughs and returns her hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Froppy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shoji and Tokoyami come next. Shoji\u2019s hug lifts him clear off the ground, and Dark Shadow seems just as\u2014if not more\u2014happy to see him as Tokoyami, curling around his neck and butting up against his ear like a cat. Todoroki hugs him, too, and says hello with such dazzling intensity that Izuku forgets what he was saying mid-sentence.</p>\n<p>Asui selects one of the teas Izuku brought. She watches Izuku over the paper rim.</p>\n<p>\u201cSato says he thought you were a scary child, ribbit,\u201d she says abruptly.</p>\n<p>Izuku splutters. \u201cScary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says you tackled him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I was a diehard hero fan that kept running into heroes that no one else seemed to know anything about\u2014heroes who wouldn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were we supposed to say?\u201d Jirou says. \u201cHi, we\u2019re your friends from the future, don\u2019t worry we\u2019re here to save you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, that would have helped a lot. Saved me years of stressing over the mystery.\u201d What they\u2019ve done\u2014time travelling without alerting the appropriate authorities, breaking the law to do so\u2014is big, but for his friends, it\u2019s happened in the span of a few weeks. They don\u2019t understand. Izuku scrubs a hand through his hair, suddenly shy under the combined weight on their stares. \u201cYou guys were my childhood. I had All Might, sure, but you were my heroes. My friends\u2014my only friends\u2014for ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Asui puts her tea down and hugs him. Jirou\u2019s frown wobbles and her whole face goes soft.</p>\n<p>Yaoyorozu says, gently, \u201cIt was our pleasure, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku feels himself going red again. He flails a bit. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to say something like that, even if it is true\u2014I came here with a purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tokoyami cocks his head to the side. \u201cA purpose?\u201d</p>\n<p>Asui is still leant against his shoulder, sipping her tea, and Dark Shadow is wrapped around his arm, gnawing at his fingers like he isn\u2019t incredibly powerful and could take off Izuku\u2019s arm easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to invite you all to dinner,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inko pours all her worry into preparing for the upcoming dinner. Izuku had thought she had adjusted to his semi-regular stints in the hospital over the years. He had been wrong. Even now, a few years shy of thirty, sitting unchallenged at the top of the Hero Charts, she worries about him like he\u2019s six years old again, quirkless and rambling about imaginary heroes as if they were real.</p>\n<p>At the end of the week, Shinsou and Bubblegum Blitz head another raid. They find Redo, burnt out from weeks of sending people hurtling through time, barely able to fight back. Two days after his arrest and the arrest of every other villain involved, Inko is sweeping Izuku\u2019s ex-classmates into the living room, where an extra dining table has been fitted to accommodate them all.</p>\n<p>Uraraka bursts through the front door, panting as if she had sprinted up the stairwell, and scans the growing crowd. Her eyes lock onto Izuku, and then she\u2019s running again. Izuku scoops her up and lets her cling to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave you,\u201d she says into his hair. She\u2019s crying. Izuku starts crying, too. \u201cYou were just a kid, and I knew about all the terrible villain attacks that were coming your way, and I had to <em>leave you</em> there to deal with them on your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d Izuku reminds her. \u201cI found you guys a few months after that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka isn\u2019t the only one that cries that night. Inko tears up after every other introduction, and Aoyama ruins his mascara when she kisses him on both cheeks and thanks him sincerely for looking after her boy. He thinks Hagakure cries, too, but he can\u2019t prove it.</p>\n<p>Todoroki finds him in the kitchen. \u201cAre you healed now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI\u2019m going back to work on Monday and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki pulls him into a crushing hug. One arm is around Izuku\u2019s waist, clutching at his shirt, and the other presses Izuku\u2019s head to his shoulder. Izuku can feel the shape of his slim fingers, buried in his curls.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could see you were hurting,\u201d Todoroki says, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I had to let you found me again, let you reach out to me at the sports festival. I wished I could have helped you the way you helped me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYou saved me too, Shouto.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t know how much time passes before one of them let's go and breaks the hug. A long while, he thinks.</p>\n<p>Izuku is on the couch talking to Iida when Inko makes her way to Kacchan. He goes stiff and pink under her gaze. Kirishima stays by his side and charms Inko with his big smile and bigger muscles. He places a hand on Kacchan\u2019s lower back, and Kacchan, somehow, finds the courage to apologise for everything he has done.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were one of them, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Inko says. \u201cOne of the heroes who saved Izuku?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Kirishima says.</p>\n<p>Inko lays a hand on Kacchan\u2019s cheek, and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking after my baby for years. You\u2019re okay, Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku has to look away from the open expression on Kacchan\u2019s face. It\u2019s too much.</p>\n<p>After dinner, Shinsou, the unbelievable traitor, tells everyone not in the know about Izuku\u2019s nicknames for them all, and then sits back and laughs when they demand answers.</p>\n<p>Sato stares vacantly at the wall. \u201cYellow Might? Midoriya. Why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why I just told him the truth, ribbit,\u201d Asui says.</p>\n<p>Kaminari points at Iida, who\u2019s still trying to process <em>Almost-Ingenium.</em> \u201cIida gave us that big scary lecture about the sanctity of time travel!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was rubbish,\u201d Asui says. \u201cNo offence, Iida.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost-Ingenium,\u201d Iida says to Izuku. \u201cDo you not think \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made the Ingenium legacy your own,\u201d Izuku says quickly. \u201cI just got confused when I was six and the only information I could find on you was your brother, who looked so much like you but was clearly not you. Do you know how stressful that was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come Momo got such a cool name, though?\u201d Jirou demands. Yaoyorozu fiddles with her ponytail, visibly pleased.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Uraraka says, sing-song, \u201cI think Todoroki definitely got the best name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was so taken with you when he was little,\u201d Inko says. \u201cHe used to insist that his drawings weren\u2019t an accurate representation of how pretty you were.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki blinks and makes a sound like a computer rebooting itself. Uraraka slams her hands down on the table and demands, \u201c<em>Drawings?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how Izuku ends up in his childhood room with nineteen of his once-childhood heroes vying for space. He pulls out journal after journal and lets them pass them around. He\u2019s torn between an odd mix of horrified embarrassment and pride at seeing them get so excited about his childish scribbles and anecdotes and theories, touching the crayon drawings with something like relevance.</p>\n<p>Todoroki slides up to Izuku while everyone is caught up in an argument about who has the best drawing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he says, and then wets his lips, pulls on the sleeves of his sweater. \u201cIzuku. Your drawings \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flails a hand in the air. \u201cAh, sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you or make things weird. I guess I couldn\u2019t help myself from drawing you all when I was little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cI wanted to ask: can I have a copy of my pages? I want to frame them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to<em> what?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Every time the journals make their way to Kacchan\u2019s corner of the room, he quickly passes them on. He was the first person out of this group to see these pages. There are still gaps in the books, frayed edges left as evidence from where Kacchan tore out entire pages or threw the journals around, playing keep away with Izuku\u2019s belongings.</p>\n<p>Kacchan was the first person to see this journals later on, too, when Izuku confronted him in his dorm room. Izuku was the first person to see Kacchan\u2019s drawings, too.</p>\n<p>When Kacchan looks up and meets his eye, Izuku smirks. His eyes say: <em>Wait until they realise that you have drawings, too.</em></p>\n<p>Kacchan scowls.<em> Don\u2019t you fucking dare. I showed you that in confidence, you bastard.</em></p>\n<p>And Izuku laughs because they both know that, after Izuku has gone back in time, he won\u2019t hesitate before enthusiastically telling the entire class about Kacchan\u2019s drawings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The news doesn\u2019t cover the jail break. Time travel quirks don\u2019t get mentioned in the public sphere; Izuku would never have known that Redo existed, if he hadn\u2019t spent his childhood chasing after heroes that everyone else thought were imaginary.</p>\n<p>The text message comes Wednesday morning when it is still dark and Izuku is just sneaking back into his apartment after an easy nighttime patrol.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Group Chat: Aizawa\u2019s Angels</p>\n<p>Mind Black: Redo has escaped. We think he\u2019s sending another group back.</p>\n<p>Mind Black: Meet at my apartment in 20mins.</p>\n<p>Mind Blank: We\u2019re jumping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku brushes his teeth and changes out of his sweat-crusted suit. He grabs his spare suit and an older version of his mouth guard and mask, one that extends up past his forehead and into his curls, and runs back out the door. Sleep can wait.</p>\n<p>Because it\u2019s so early in the morning, only a handful of people arrive at Shinsou\u2019s apartment. Most of his ex-classmates are either asleep, or working, or live too far away to make it to an impromptu meet up.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been awhile since Izuku has been to Shinsou\u2019s apartment. When a preteen with white hair and slitted pupils opens the door, Izuku thinks he has the wrong address.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku says, taking a step back, \u201cI must have made a mistake\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou peers over the top of the girl. \u201cWhat did I say about opening the door on your own?\u201d He shoos the kid out of the way and then opens the door wider to let Izuku in. \u201cSorry. She\u2019s kind of a fan. I have no idea why, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl glowers up at Shinsou, still-half hidden behind him. \u201cHitoshi, it\u2019s <em>Deku</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou gently shoves her back into the living room. \u201cHe\u2019s the Number One, I think he can take an old friend poking fun of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m honoured,\u201d Izuku says, and smiles when Shinsou glares at him. Standing together like that, with their strangely coloured hair and matching scowls, they could be father and daughter.</p>\n<p>Kirishima bounces through the open front door, ignoring both Shinsou and Izuku in favour of the kid. \u201cHey, T! How are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl\u2019s hard stare melts away. She turns shy and quiet under Izuku and Kirishima\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she mumbles. She peeks at Izuku, as though checking to see if he\u2019s still there, and then reddens and ducks into the hallway and out of sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I scare her off?\u201d Izuku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s just shy,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cI told her she was invited to your dinner party a few weeks ago, but she didn\u2019t want to come. It would\u2019ve been too much for her, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a shy kid, too,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou snorts, like he doesn\u2019t believe that. But then, Izuku had never really been shy around his heroes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s a big hero fan, or that you\u2019re her favourite, Midoriya. It\u2019s weird having posters of you in my apartment, even if it is just in her bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHer room?\u201d Izuku repeats. \u201cYou adopted her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shinsou says.</p>\n<p>Jirou sticks his head out of the kitchen. \u201cHe totally did,\u201d she says. \u201cHey, Midoriya, Kirishima. Where\u2019s Bakugou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorking,\u201d Kirishima says. To Izuku, he says, \u201cThat was Traverse. Shinsou says he\u2019s just looking after her until he can finalise her entry into UA, but really, he\u2019s basically adopted the kid. It\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou opens and closes his mouth. Finally, he manages to choke out, \u201cHer parents are vile, and she could be exploited if anyone finds out how strong her quirk is, and I\u2019m not about to let a kid with that much potential slip through the cracks, let alone live on the streets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoftie,\u201d Jirou heckles.</p>\n<p>Ashido slips through the front door. She\u2019s wearing a denim jacket over her pyjamas, and holding her hero suit and something laminated rolled into a tube.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my favourite little hero?\u201d she says without saying hello to her old friends clustered in the entryway. She glances around and when she doesn\u2019t see a head of white hair, she hollers, \u201cTraverse, get in here. I\u2019ve got presents!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou tries to hush her and remind them all that he has neighbours, until Jirou snorts, and says, \u201cIs that another Deku poster?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest one I could find,\u201d Ashido says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Shinsou says flatly.</p>\n<p>Ashido manoeuvres around them and jogs deeper into the apartment, Deku poster held aloft like a baton. \u201cI absolutely did. I\u2019m going to try and convince her to hang it up in the living room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku makes a choked sound in the back of his throat, unable to form proper syllables. Shinsou says, \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ashido disappears around the corner, and Shinsou runs after her. Jirou snickers and follows them.</p>\n<p>Kirishima looks unbothered by this. He shuts the door, takes off his shoes, and asks Izuku, \u201cWould you like coffee? I\u2019m going to go make some for everyone. Maybe that will wake us all up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Standing in Shinsou\u2019s cramped kitchen beside Kirishima, listening as Kaminari and Sero\u2019s voices are added to the disaster going on in the living room, Izuku cannot help but wonder what it was like for his classmates going back the first time around.</p>\n<p>Were they scared to time travel for the first time? Where did they first meet\u2014here, in Shinsou\u2019s small apartment, all twenty of them attempting to crowd into the living room; or was it in the dusty rented out apartment, their voices echoing through the unfurnished rooms; or was it somewhere else? A hero office? Somewhere secluded on the outskirts of town, like Izuku had always imagined?</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s so relaxed,\u201d Izuku wonders, as Ashido picks Traverse up and carries her through the apartment. She looks a lot smaller bracketed in Ashido\u2019s muscled arms. When Ashido parades her through the kitchen, she gets overwhelmed by Izuku\u2019s presence once more, and hides her face in Ashido\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kirishima says, laying out mugs on the counter, \u201cthey\u2019re not. Not really. Traverse is scared of her quirk. Shinsou says there hasn\u2019t been a documented case of anyone having a time-related quirk anywhere near as strong as her\u2019s. Most of the time, it\u2019s too difficult to send people back a few months, let alone years, and Traverse can send us back over two decades.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d Izuku begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cRedo uses multiple quirk-boosting drugs. I think he\u2019s just trying to send as many people back as he can before he overdoses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod,\u201d Izuku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kirishima says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she going to be okay to send us back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe can do it without breaking a sweat,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cShinsou says that she once accidentally sent someone back fifty years. One day, she fought back against a bully and he just disappeared. A week later, the same kid tracked her down. He wasn\u2019t ten anymore. He was an adult and almost sixty years old.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima balances the mugs on a tray and takes them into the next room, leaving Izuku to his thoughts. Kirishima had seemed off all morning. While their friends were bounding around the apartment and playing with Traverse, Kirishima had been quiet. Reserved. It tells him just as much about why they\u2019re here as Shinsou\u2019s messages had.</p>\n<p>Once enough people have arrived, they move into the office. The space has been transformed\u2014all the furniture has been moved out, photos and notes taped to the wall, and in the middle of the room, a rug with pillows has been laid down. It looks like they\u2019re preparing the space for a sleepover-cum-study session, not to travel back in time.</p>\n<p>They settle down in a circle, cross-legged, and then Shinsou starts: \u201cWe don\u2019t think they\u2019re going after Midoriya again. That was a planned mission. This is spontaneous. And this time, they know that we\u2019re monitoring Midoriya\u2019s childhood. They know attacking him again won\u2019t work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are we here?\u201d Jirou asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said they weren\u2019t targeted Midoriya,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cI didn\u2019t say they weren\u2019t planning an attack at all.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s hold tightens on his mug. \u201cWe think they\u2019re going after Bakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKilling off the Number Two Hero would damage the timeline, too,\u201d Traverse says shyly. \u201cAnd maybe it would destabilise Deku\u2019s role as the Symbol of Peace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey grew up together,\u201d Sero realises. \u201cIf Bakugou is killed as a kid, then it would seriously impact Midoriya emotionally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no maybe about it,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cIf Kacchan is killed before I start at UA, I wouldn\u2019t be a hero. I\u2019d be a total stranger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kirishima says in that same flat tone he\u2019s been using all morning, \u201cme too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks around the circle. The people here are the ones Kacchan had mentioned: Ashido with Traverse half on her lap, Kaminari trying valiantly to stay awake, and Sero, and Jirou, and Izuku, and Kirishima, glaring down at his mug like it has personally wronged him.</p>\n<p>Izuku had imagined that, before they time travelled again, they would have held a class-wide meeting and the six of them would have volunteered to time travel again. They\u2019re the six people who are closest to Kacchan, after all. It makes sense.</p>\n<p>He never thought that the six of them would be chosen randomly, by fate. If Uraraka was awake, if her phone wasn\u2019t on mute, she would be here, and Floaty Girl would have been a part of Kacchan\u2019s childhood. If Iida didn\u2019t work early in the morning, then Kacchan would have been squinting at the computer monitor, trying to rectify the differences between Ingenium and the hero who saved him, just like Izuku had.</p>\n<p>If the text had come any earlier, when Izuku was still on patrol, then his phone would have stayed in his locker, unchecked, and Kacchan would never have met the green-suited hero who never gave up.</p>\n<p>That thought horrifies Izuku.</p>\n<p>A small, inexperienced Kacchan is somewhere out there\u2014sometime out there\u2014with no way of defending himself. Is this how his friends felt, going back, realising that the hero they had stood beside for years was now a vulnerable child? He understands why some of them were so rattled when they first met him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let anything happen to him,\u201d Sero says, laying a hand on Kirishima\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d Traverse says bravely, glancing from Kirishima to Izuku, \u201cbecause you\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirishima blows out a breath. Izuku balls his hands into fists, and says, \u201cWe can do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Traverse falls into a sleep-like trance, seeking out Kacchan and the disturbances in the timeline. Izuku wonders just how powerful she is. She\u2019s still in middle school. How powerful will she become?</p>\n<p>Shinsou looks around the circle. \u201cIs there anything anyone needs to say before we go back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks at Jirou and Kirishima. He almost opens his mouth to warn them about tumbling onto UA\u2019s campus and getting caught. Don\u2019t disrupt the timeline, Aizawa had said. Izuku closes his mouth.</p>\n<p>When no one speaks up, Shinsou pulls out a tub of what looks like wristwatches\u2014black with no clock face. He hands them out to the group. Everyone takes one silently. There is no teasing, now. The play-fighting from earlier is a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>Izuku fastens the wristwatch. It hums against his skin as though it\u2019s alive. The screen on the front lights up. It gives him information on disturbances in the timeline, and a direct feed with Shinsou, and the date, shining at the very top of the watch.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cWho wants to go first?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The jump is seamless. Traverse lays her hand on Izuku\u2019s forehead like a baptism, and closes to her eyes. Her fingers warm against his skin. Static runs down his spine, and then the quiet chatter in Shinsou\u2019s apartment gives way to the distant sound of traffic and children playing. Izuku opens his eyes. He recognises this street. He grew up here. He would take this path to school everyday when he was little.</p>\n<p>He checks the date on the watch. He\u2019s twenty-one years in the past.</p>\n<p>Izuku follows the tracker in the watch until he reaches a familiar stretch of bushland. The villain half-hidden in the trees is drunk off the power of facing someone who can\u2019t fight back, and doesn\u2019t even realise the Symbol of Peace has broken out into a sprint behind him.</p>\n<p>One for All propels him off the ground and he kicks the villain deeper into the bush. The villain gets back up. Izuku grabs him around the collar and flips them both through the air, landing with the villain pinned beneath him. He secures handcuffs around his wrists, and slots a muzzle loosely around his mouth to stop him from saying anything incriminating.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWow.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku touches his mask, reassuring himself that his freckled face is hidden by it\u2019s outdated fit, and then turns around.</p>\n<p>Kacchan is sprawled against overgrown tree roots. His face is scuffed with dirt and he\u2019s holding his All Might backpack like a shield. From the date, from Izuku\u2019s own faded memories, he knows that this Kacchan is six years old.</p>\n<p>Kacchan scrambles to his feet. His small face shines up at Izuku. The wide, vague eyes, the open mouth\u2014this is the way Kacchan used to look at All Might. Why is he looking at Izuku like that?</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you a pro hero?\u201d Kacchan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am.\u201d And then, without even thinking about it, Izuku asks, \u201cWould you like to be friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan stares at him. He doesn\u2019t blink. He barely breathes. For one moment, despite knowing what he does about the future, he thinks Kacchan can see right through him. He thinks, just for a second, that this tiny, inexperienced Kacchan will look him up and down and say, <em>No</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kacchan says finally. He takes a deep breathe, and balls his hands into fists, and rocks forward, the way he always used to stand when confronting upperclassmen, and blurts, \u201cCan I have your autograph?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou \u2026 you want my\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took down that villain like it was nothing. He didn\u2019t even know you were there before\u2014<em>bam!</em> He was down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan laughs and jumps up and down, almost tripping on the uneven ground. It\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s has seen Kacchan\u2019s unfiltered joy. Izuku can\u2019t help the laugh that bubbles up his throat, the smile that spreads beneath the mask.</p>\n<p>This is the same stretch of bushland where they used to go looking for beetles. This is where they first founded the Bakugou Katsuki Hero Agency. Here, through those stretch of trees, Froppy saved him from drowning. This is where Izuku say Floaty Girl and Ice Prince for the very last time.</p>\n<p>The bushland is smaller than the remembers. But then, so is Kacchan.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Bakugou Katsuki,\u201d Kacchan declares. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a hero just like you when I grow up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan rifles through his backpack and pulls out an exercise book and a coloured pencil. He holds them up to Izuku expectedly.</p>\n<p>Izuku takes the book and pencil like they\u2019re made of finely spun glass. His hands look enormous next to Kacchan\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Carefully, Izuku writes out: <em>Katsuki,</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>I look forward to working with you one day. You\u2019ll be a better hero than you know.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Like Uraraka and Todoroki and the other heroes that have come before, Izuku signs it simply, <em>Your friend.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
