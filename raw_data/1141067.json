Stiles had lived there all his life. His first memories were of getting underfoot upstairs as his mother baked and cooked in the evenings, tangling young limbs in the bright threads of cotton as she spun downstairs and being lulled into hypnotised silence as her nimble fingers wove fantastical beasts and delicate flowers from seemingly nothing. During the day, she would have him sit on the scrubbed wooden counter and suck on a sugar sweet as customers complimented her on her fine weaving and pretty designs, or watch, enraptured, as she fashioned masks from cardstock and cloth, and rosettes from fabric. His father, a peace officer of the town, was always gone in the mornings before he roused, but by the time the little shop had shut and the stew was almost finished bubbling on the hearth, he was home. His ruddy, worn face eased into smile lines as his large hand cupped the back of his head fondly, letting Stiles help disrobe him of his blue gendarme\u2019s coat, wrapping both of them into his bear-like arms.</p>\n<p>Being a bluecoat didn\u2019t pay well, and his mother\u2019s creations, beautiful as they were, often gathered more dust on the walls of the shop than coins in her hand. Regardless of their shortcomings, what little they had was good, and, despite not having as many toys as the other children in town, Stiles was happy. His father was the absolute embodiment of heroism in his eyes, and his mother, with her soft, brown hair, tender smile and soft singing voice as she spun, the personification of gentleness. Once he was old enough to stay (mostly) out of trouble, he helped his mother dust the shelves and wax down the wooden counter downstairs, and, between absorbing his numbers and letters, learnt how his mother spoke with customers, took commissions and jobs, and exchanged coin. Under her watchful eye, he breezed through his studies much faster than anyone would have expected, and soon enough he was manning the counter, helping fill in the little booklet of orders with pencil, his handwriting choppy and nowhere near as elegant as his mother\u2019s looped script.</p>\n<p>Some evenings, they\u2019d sit by the hearth and his mother would attempt to teach him to spin. His fingers were quick and clever enough to handle the basics, but somehow he never quite seemed to master the delicate grace of the woven craft. One evening, his father\u2019s work trousers came apart at the pocket seam, and Stiles found himself sitting at his mother\u2019s knee with a needle in his hand, her patient instructions slowly guiding him through the mend. His stitches were a little wobbly and uneven at first, but soon enough the tear was mended, good as new. His father clapped him on the shoulder proudly, beaming at his work, and Stiles felt a swell of joy so great he thought his heart might just burst.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He decided to apply for an apprenticeship at a local tailor when he turned seven. His mother could only teach him so much when it came to sewing, and he\u2019d taken over the household chores of mending and darning when the need arose. His nimble fingers and thirst for knowledge delighted both his parents, even if sometimes his boredom led him to mischief, exasperating them and his neighbours with his silly antics. He\u2019d begged and pleaded for days until she\u2019d relented with a fond sigh, the upward curve of her lips belying the exasperated expression on her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cA tailor is a fine profession,\u201d his father crowed proudly as they ate supper one night, after he and his mother recounted their trip further into town to Deaton\u2019s, an old friend of his father. It had been, by far, the most nerve-racking experience of his life, and even with being almost grown (he was <em>seven</em>!), Stiles had held his mother\u2019s hand the entire walk there, barely speaking a word and quivering with nerves as if he were being led to the gallows. Deaton had been a good sort, a soft-spoken man with an enigmatic smile, pleased to see that, in the face of Stiles\u2019 young age, he\u2019d found a career path worth pursuing. He\u2019d kindly shut his door to the outside and showed Stiles and his mother around his workshop, explaining the different cottons he used, the length and width of the needles he used, the strangely-shaped rulers with gentle curves.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeven is a little young to be an apprentice,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cBut learning waits for no man \u2013 or youth, in this case. If you\u2019re truly interested in taking up a vocation as a tailor, I would be more than glad to take you under my tutelage.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thus, Stiles found himself at Deaton\u2019s for two days a week, grasping a lunch in a folded kerchief as his mother walked him to the other man\u2019s store early in the mornings.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss my little man on the days when you aren\u2019t here,\u201d she laughed a little wistfully, patting him on the back as Stiles darted through Deaton\u2019s doors, the chime above the entrance tinkling sweetly. He was still far too young to work on anything, or be paid, but Deaton was a patient man, and kept his childish, flighty attention focused at all times. When Stiles wasn\u2019t running errands for him like buying buttons in the market or fetching him tools, he stood behind the man and watched with rapt attention as the older man talked while he worked, showing him how he drew the lines of the suit on fabric with tailor\u2019s chalk, how long and spaced apart a basting stitch should be and why. He taught Stiles different types of stitches, and assigned him a square foot of calico to practice his tacks on as a sampler, which Stiles worked on diligently. His mother labelled the different stitches in pencil, and Deaton nodded approvingly when presented with the sampler. In four months, Stiles had learnt enough to be allowed to sew buttons onto cuffs and suit fronts with careful, neat stitches. Deaton wouldn\u2019t let him do any more for the time being, but Stiles was glad enough to be of use, and for every dozen buttons he tacked on, Deaton would pay him with a copper penny.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour work saves me a lot of time, Stiles,\u201d Deaton would often smile at him, \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident that, within a few years, you\u2019ll be doing far more work for me than sewing buttons. You might as well enjoy the peace while you can \u2013 I feel that you\u2019ll soon be a very busy young man.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother became sick in the winter. The rosiness ever-present in her cheeks dulled to a white pallor that, despite her insistences of merely being struck with the winter chills, never seemed to get any better. Her weaving took longer and longer, until her graceful hands shook too much to do anything at all, and eventually she stopped spinning altogether. Her smiles turned into weak, watered-down imitations of what they\u2019d once been, and her voice became watery and frail, too frail to sing and fill their house with music. Deaton was understanding beyond measure, giving Stiles as much time as he needed away from the store to help tend to her, but regardless of his ever-present care, Stiles\u2019 mother grew wan and fragile, her hands paper-thin and almost insubstantial upon the sheets of her bed. She slept long hours with Stiles sitting at her bedside, reading book after book, sometimes aloud to her, sometimes quietly to himself, his throat too constricted to utter a single sound.</p>\n<p>While she slept, he made vegetable soups and hearty, warm stews from her recipe books to put flesh back into her bones, but her appetite was light, and often she struggled keeping food down. The lines on his father\u2019s face deepened with worry as they ate their supper together in the evenings, the silence of the house interspersed with the occasional coughing from his parents\u2019 room.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe medicine \u2013 it isn\u2019t working,\u201d Stiles murmured, pushing a carrot through his soup listlessly with his spoon.</p>\n<p>His father didn\u2019t say anything. Stiles could read his face like an open book, though, and the sentiments <em>you\u2019re a good son</em>, <em>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with her,</em> <em>I couldn\u2019t do any of this without you</em>, were written plain as day on his honest countenance. They made him feel as though his efforts weren\u2019t nearly all worthless, that perhaps things would get better.</p>\n<p>For a little while, they\u2019d been convinced that she was beginning to recover, because she\u2019d been eating a little more, staying awake for longer periods of time. She spoke to Stiles for hours on end about their family, how she\u2019d met his father, how they\u2019d gotten married under the large beech tree in the forest nearby, close to a rundown chapel. His father had taken some time off his patrols, and stayed with her night and day. It was funny, how the saying went, that a candle burned its brightest before it extinguishes.</p>\n<p>He was eight when his mother died. She slipped away during the night, his father holding her hand, a small, sincere smile on her lips. Stiles was asleep \u2013 he woke up to the sound of his father\u2019s sobs in the next room over, and his own, little heart shattering into a thousand fragments. Stiles\u2019 mother had burned so brightly that she\u2019d only burned half as long.</p>\n<p>They buried her beneath the beech where his parents had married, then a small funeral plot with a half-dozen graves scattered around it, their headstones still polished and smooth. Only a handful of people came to the service, Deaton included, and his hand was a comforting weight on Stiles\u2019 narrow shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cClaudia was a gift to this world,\u201d he murmured afterwards in his reassuring voice, while his father stood beside them, face wrecked with grief. \u201cI\u2019ll understand if you wish to take some time to yourself. My door is always open to you, Stiles \u2013 you\u2019ve been by far the most enthusiastic apprentice I\u2019ve had.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was almost four months after his mother died before Stiles could bring himself to leave the house again. His father had returned to work after only a couple of weeks, money a necessity in their lives, and Stiles spent just about every day at Deaton\u2019s, learning the art of tailoring under his watchful eye. He cooked and cleaned and kept the house in order, and dined with his father in the evenings. Sometimes his father had to work the occasional night shift, to cover the coin that his mother used to make with her weavings. They didn\u2019t need to buy as much food anymore, since it was only the two of them, so they got by on his father\u2019s income and Stiles\u2019 infinitesimal pay.</p>\n<p>They worked, and they got on with their lives. Stiles slowly began to suture up the hole in his heart, and though neither of them were quite the same, time brought them closer together. The scar of their missing piece is always there, always present in the woven tapestries on the wall that neither of them have the heart to pack away.</p>\n<p>They lived.</p>\n<p>He was young still when his father passed, seventeen, still honing his skills at stretching fabric so the warp and weft of it are even, finding the grain and bias of cloth with his eye rather than aligning the square ruler against the selvage. He had three embroidered waistcoats, five sashes, a cassock, and more jabots than he could count under his belt, Deaton pleased enough with his skills to give him actual commissions and pay, well on his way to being a fully-qualified tailor. Tara, one of his father\u2019s workmates, burst into Deaton\u2019s store that fateful day, chest heaving with exertion, and told Stiles that his father had collapsed while on patrol. Deaton didn\u2019t say a word as he ushered them both out of his shop, locking the door quickly behind them as they rushed back to Stiles\u2019 house.</p>\n<p>According to the physician, it was his weak heart that caused him to collapse, despite Stiles\u2019 conscientious care and fastidious conviction with eating healthy meals. He stayed at home for a week, looking after his ailing parent, and his father managed to stay awake long enough for each of them to say goodbye, to reaffirm how much they love each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was always proud,\u201d he wheezed, face ashen as he gripped Stiles\u2019 hand in his own, hard enough for their bones to creak. Stiles only then realized how much smaller his father appeared than he remembered \u2013 always the hulking, bear-like figure with the ruddy, proud face. \u201cYou and your mother, you are the two greatest things that have happened to me in this life.\u201d</p>\n<p>They buried his father under the beech tree, beside his mother. His father had never felt complete when she\u2019d gone, but at least they were together again, even in death. Deaton stood beside him at the service, and Stiles, almost a man, didn\u2019t feel ashamed at all when the tears ran freely down his face. Deaton had been named as his guardian until he finished his apprenticeship, and, even being his ward, Stiles was given the freedom to choose whether or not he wanted to continue living in his family\u2019s home. Stiles couldn\u2019t imagine anywhere else he\u2019d rather be, so he stayed.</p>\n<p>He was given a month off work with pay, and Deaton practically forced him to stay away from the shop, despite Stiles feeling as though he\u2019s taking advantage of Deaton\u2019s abundant kindness. So Stiles mourned, broke apart, and took the time to slowly put himself and his life back together again. He cleaned the house, but didn\u2019t throw anything of his parents\u2019 away. He prepared to move on with his life, as usual. And when he returned to Deaton\u2019s after a month, it was with full pay and more responsibilities than ever, seeing as Deaton was relying on him as his head-cutter and drafter now.</p>\n<p>Stiles worked, and life went on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThese gloves are amazing, Stiles,\u201d Scott gushed, tracing the embroidered vine leaves along the wrists, and, although he\u2019d been making things for the young Lord for years, Stiles still can\u2019t get used to the compliments directed at his work. His tailoring business is located at his house now, five years since completing his tailoring apprenticeship. He\u2019s twenty-three, and while his business isn\u2019t exactly booming, he\u2019s made enough of a name for himself in town as a fine tailor with a good eye for detail, and he\u2019s gotten a few return customers, and some exclusively requesting his skills. Lord McCall was, by far, one of his best and most loyal customers, and closest friend. Even without requesting an order, it would not be uncommon for him to visit Stiles at his shop, or for them to have meals together.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do believe you\u2019re sorely mistaken, Scott,\u201d he smiled in return, sheathing his snips into his tool roll on the bench, smoothing down the fabric edges with his nimble fingertips. Despite Scott\u2019s high status as a Lord in town, they were close friends, and at ease with each other enough to forego formalities and call each other by their given names. Scott\u2019s mother, Melissa, was a famous physician at court, one of the few female practicing the arts of healing, and had made quite a name for their family. He was, what they called, \u2018New Money\u2019, and some looked upon that with scorn. Stiles, however, found the young Lord easier to speak to, since Scott\u2019s attitude was more down to earth than most he knew.</p>\n<p>\u201cPish posh, you know you\u2019re the only tailor I\u2019ll pay coin to,\u201d the other youth smiled, taking a small satchel of coin from his pocket and settling it onto the table. \u201cI don\u2019t care what people may think, I believe you\u2019ve the finest stitchwork in all the country. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ll trust to make my clothes now, especially when it\u2019s so fun to stay and chat. The other tailors are so dreadfully boring compared to you,\u201d his smile was warm and lopsided as he spoke, sincerity radiating from his honest, sweet face.</p>\n<p>\u201cFlattery gets you everywhere,\u201d Stiles returned, hefting the little bag of coins. His eyebrows rose higher as the coins clinked inside, and, pulling the drawstrings open, he was surprised to see a couple of gold coins settled among the silver. \u201cScott, this is far more than the gloves are worth. I can\u2019t accept this payment, it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you <em>should</em> charge, Stiles. These gloves, the waistcoat you embroidered for me last month, everything you make is so wonderful, and it\u2019s almost a crime at how low your prices are. Now, I won\u2019t hear any arguments,\u201d his hand rose between them, effectively cutting off Stiles\u2019 retort, \u201cConsider it a gratuity for the constant excellence of your work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stiles scoffed back, pocketing the coins. \u201cIt\u2019s your loss, Lord McCall. Just don\u2019t be surprised if the prices I begin charging you are higher than usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cServes me right, then,\u201d he replied with a smile, tucking the new gloves into his belt. A few minutes of idle chatter, and then Scott was gone, off to see to some business or other, or accept another fancy invite from his busy social schedule. Tired from the hard day\u2019s work, Stiles flipped the sign on his shop and closed the door, done for the day.</p>\n<p>It still felt strange, sometimes, working from the same downstairs studio where his mother spun and sold her works. Now the building belonged to Stiles alone, and spoke of nothing but a busy tailor. Isaac, an old friend of his, had helped him to build shelves and a cutting table for the workshop, but aside from that, all the furniture was the same from his mother\u2019s day, including the scrubbed wooden counter at the front, and the comfortably worn, oak chair that she spent hours sitting on, weaving her fantastical designs. Scrubbing a hand over his face, Stiles spent a few minutes tidying his things away, sliding his shears back into their rightful place, righting his pincushions, needle tray and measuring tapes.</p>\n<p>Some days he felt fine, living in this house, running his own business. Deaton had taught him so much, before his retirement, that he felt confident enough in his craft to know could survive on his income. But that was also part of the problem \u2013 he could survive, yes, but he wasn\u2019t particularly <em>living</em>. And while he was doing something he loved, it wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d imagined spending the rest of his days \u2013 living in his childhood home with the ghost of his parents upstairs. Stiles shrugged his shoulders offhandedly as he swept the stray threads off his worktable into the wastebasket, not wanting to waste any more thought on the subject. He supposed it could be worse \u2013 he could be stuck in a career he despised, or be out on the streets without a roof over his head. He shouldn\u2019t really wish for anything so far out of his reach, like thrills or excitement. It wasn\u2019t living, but it was what he had, and it would do just fine.</p>\n<p>His workspace clean, Stiles trudged upstairs to change into more comfortable clothes, perhaps bathe later, and see what he could dredge up from the pantry for supper. His mind was too weary to even think about working more on his own suit, tucked away in the work cupboard below.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, tell me what the matter is,\u201d Scott urged, leaning over the counter as Stiles sketched away on paper. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in a mood for days, ever since I commissioned that new suit off you for next month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Stiles waved carelessly, putting the final touches on the design with pencil before turning it around on the desk to face Scott. \u201cHow does this look?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d the young Lord enthused, his face lit up with a grin as he virtually gushed over the design. \u201cThis is absolutely brilliant \u2013 you\u2019re sure that you\u2019ll have this done by then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a bit of a stretch, especially if I have any other orders coming in, but I\u2019m sure I could do it.\u201d To be perfectly honest with himself, Stiles hadn't received any new orders yet, but he knew the end of the month was a special occasion \u2013 the Hale family\u2019s annual ball, and he\u2019d soon be swamped with orders for embroidered kerchiefs, sashes, almost anything, really. His embroidery was fine and in demand at this time, but even he knew that he\u2019d be piling on too much work on his plate. Still, it\u2019d be a welcome distraction from the event itself.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles \u2013 this is an <em>incredibly important</em> suit \u2013 I\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll pay your wages for the entire month until it\u2019s finished!\u201d Scott leaned forward and grabbed his hands between his own, his face intent. \u201cIf you take nobody else\u2019s orders but my own, it\u2019ll definitely get done, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ask that of me, Scott!\u201d he replied, his face slack with shock. \u201cYou \u2013 you\u2019re suggesting I literally close my door to everybody else until <em>after</em> the ball? Do you know how much that\u2019ll cost you in earnings? You\u2019re mad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Scott argued back, the grip on his hands tightening. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to pay you whatever you want, as long as this gets done. It\u2019s <em>vital</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so significant about this suit in particular?\u201d Stiles probed with an inquisitorial raise of his eyebrow. \u201cYou seem awfully fixated on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 argh!\u201d The other youth stepped back, running a hand nervously through his close-cropped curls. He cast his gaze around suspiciously, as if to seek out eavesdroppers. \u201cAlright \u2013 look, you know Allison, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean Lady Argent? The same Lady Argent that you\u2019ve been hopelessly smitten for since she moved to the capital a few years ago? The same Lady whom you wax poetic over every single time you come in for a fitting?\u201d Stiles grinned conspiratorially, leaning his elbows down on the wooden counter. \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure I\u2019ve heard every poetic synonym describing the flowing texture of her hair, rosy hue of her cheeks, and the most charming, coquettish dimples known to man.\u201d He scratched a blunt nail against the wood, loosening a spot of grit. \u201cIf I recall correctly, she\u2019d been accepting an awful lot of invitations from you for outings and suppers and rides. Is there anything wrong? Are you in the metaphorical doghouse and need to dig yourself out, my friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite the opposite,\u201d Scott sighed, his face turning dreamy and wistful. \u201cI recently visited her father and asked for her hand in marriage \u2013 I plan to propose at the ball, when we have a few moments to ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! It\u2019s no wonder you want everything perfect. I promise you the suit will get done, and to the best of my abilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you \u2013 oh, <em>thank you</em>, Stiles! You have no idea how much this means to me.\u201d Scott came around the bench and grasped his shoulder firmly, pulling him into an embrace which Stiles warmly returned, if somewhat awkwardly before Scott pulled back, looking him hard in the eye. \u201cI want no expense spared for this \u2013 use whatever you need, I\u2019ll be more than happy to spare the coin. And I meant what I said, I\u2019ll pay your income until the ball.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not necess-\u201d he began, but was once again hushed. Well \u2013 it seemed that Lord McCall was not one to argue against.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMother, please,\u201d Derek grumbled with exasperation, stirring sugar into his tea over breakfast. \u201cIs the ball really necessary this year? We have one hosted every single Spring, surely skipping one year wouldn\u2019t do any harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf <em>course</em> it\u2019d do harm, Der,\u201d Cora rolled her eyes at him from across the table, \u201cPeople expect it of the family. It\u2019s kind of a big deal in the town now \u2013 I know for a fact that people look forward to it almost immediately after it ends, and spend the entire year in preparation for it. Anybody would give their eye teeth for an invite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid party,\u201d Derek insisted, leaning back in his chair and pushing up the sleeves on his riding coat, snug against his forearms, powerful and strong from years of outdoor activities. \u201cThere are more pressing things to focus on than a mere night of frivolity. Like the-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-The stable roof being re-shingled, yes, like we haven\u2019t heard that a thousand times before,\u201d Cora snipped back with irritation. \u201cAll you ever care about is those stupid horses of yours, and going out on your silly hunting adventures and gallivanting around the fields like a peasant, with muddied clothes and unpolished boots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, my darling, the roof is going to be fixed later in the week,\u201d his mother smiled from the other end of the breakfast counter, smiling as she sliced a fried tomato. \u201cAnd Cora, my dove, please don\u2019t belittle your brother\u2019s pastimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t lather myself in perfume and swan around in frills like a ninny,\u201d Derek whispered back hotly, feeling his ears burn.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth of you calm down, you\u2019re behaving like absolute children\u201d Laura, the eldest, chided, eyes never straying from the book she was reading avidly, perched between her plate and a glass of sweet juice. \u201cDerek, you\u2019re not missing this year\u2019s party, and that\u2019s final. Cora is still a little tender from discovering this morning that Lord Everett won\u2019t be attending,\u201d and Derek smirked meanly over his plate at his younger sister, who speared her eggs with enough vindictive force to practically bend the tines of her fork, \u201cBut I think an evening amongst other members of the court will do the both of you some good. Perhaps the two of you might even learn to relax a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell put, dear,\u201d Talia nodded her head, pleased. Derek took a bite from his buttered bread and used his entire reserve of willpower not to roll his eyes at the matriarchal disposition of his family.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a fortnight before the ball, and Stiles had worked tirelessly to make his best customer (and friend) the finest suit he could. And, true to his word, Scott visited every second or third day to check on the process, and paid him far more than he would earn, even if he were inundated with other orders. This unexpected freedom gave him plenty of time to focus on the details of Scott\u2019s waistcoat, to get the braiding trim sewn perfectly and get each and every detail perfect. And, working his own hours, he even managed to work on his own project in the evenings. It was at the two-week-prior mark when Scott came in for another fitting that he noticed something was amiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever could be the matter, my friend?\u201d the young Lord inquired as Stiles tugged a panel of the coat snug, pinning it down to follow the smooth curve of Scott\u2019s back, now that he was wearing the waistcoat underneath.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what you could mean,\u201d Stiles lied through his teeth, wincing as he missed the pincushion strapped to his wrist completely and dug the sharp pin into his own skin. He quickly stepped back and peeled the pinned jacket off, not meeting Scott\u2019s eyes, but the other youth followed him to the worktable without hesitation, leaning a hip against the counter and crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you long enough now to see when something\u2019s troubling you. It started the instant I mentioned the new suit, and the closer we get to it, the more miserable you\u2019ve become. Out with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to the damn ball,\u201d Stiles spoke out all at once, his words virtually jumbling in their haste to fall from his mouth. He looked up and stared, horror-struck, at Scott, who only looked back with mild amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t go. Surely you\u2019ve a suit, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, Scott,\u201d he returned, his voice exasperated. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about having a <em>suit</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you do have one, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>! I mean \u2013 almost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost? How can you almost have a suit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, Stiles crossed the room and opened the cupboard, wheeling out one of his dress forms, the one he\u2019d adjusted to his size. His suit was still half-finished, hanging off the mannequin.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles -\u201d Scott breathed, stepping closer to examine it. Stiles couldn\u2019t help but feel the warm swell of pride \u2013 even half-finished, it was his best work yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve always wanted to attend the Hale annual ball,\u201d he spoke quietly, touching fingertips to the russet fabric of the sleeve. \u201cEver since I was a child. I\u2019d see the bright lights of the party on the hilltop through my window, and once I even saw the fireworks. It was \u2013 it was pretty spectacular. I\u2019d always dreamed of what the parties would be like \u2013 the music, the dancing. Everything just sounded so grand, so ostentatious.\u201d He ducked his head down, smiling self-consciously, slightly self-deprecating. \u201cEvery once in a while, I had a few extra coins \u2013 I\u2019d save my earnings and buy a little extra fabric, an extra yard or two of lace or braiding. And I\u2019d work on this suit in the hopes that one day, maybe, I\u2019d be able to attend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you, then?\u201d the other asked, eyebrows furrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe<em>cause</em>, Scott,\u201d Stiles sighed with vexation, \u201cNot everybody with a nice set of clothes can attend. The Hales are one of the city\u2019s oldest, wealthiest families, and their parties are legendary. Only the <em>cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me</em> are invited.\u201d He crossed his arms and scowled at the floor. \u201cI doubt they\u2019d be thrilled to find a lowly tailor in their midst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is perfect, though!\u201d Scott said excitedly, clapping a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThis year it\u2019s a masquerade ball \u2013 everyone will be masked. If you attend and wear a mask, nobody will know who you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you still need an invite to go,\u201d Stiles countered, still feeling dejected.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have an invite, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re missing the point. <em>I </em>have an invite. And Allison will be there already. I happen to have a faraway member of my family who\u2019s just come down for a few days to visit. It\u2019d be a shame to leave him home alone on such a wondrous night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what does this have to do with me?\u201d he replied, a little sharply \u2013 it was bad enough to know he couldn\u2019t attend, but to have to hear another man uncaringly go alongside his friend? He couldn\u2019t bear to think of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore thank you know, Stiles,\u201d Scott winked, grinning wide. \u201cYou see, he\u2019s from very, <em>very</em> far away. Nobody really knows him. And he\u2019s returning home right after the ball, I\u2019m afraid. But he\u2019s an ever so wonderful friend of mine. All he needs to worry about is having his suit finished in time.\u201d And he turned slightly, nodding to the half-finished garment hanging on the mannequin. Stiles balked, mouth opening and closing wordlessly for long moments, before he felt well enough to speak again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely you \u2013 Scott! I couldn\u2019t ask you for such a thing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause \u2013 <em>because</em>! You\u2019ve already done so much for me \u2013 not just in the past month, by paying me more coin than necessary to work on your clothes, but ever since I first opened my shop. You\u2019ve been my best customer, and I couldn\u2019t ask this of you, I just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, you\u2019re my friend.\u201d Scott spoke earnestly, laying both hands on Stiles\u2019 shoulders, meeting his eyes square-on. \u201cSince mother earned her title, since we\u2019ve moved into the estate \u2013 you\u2019ve been the only true friend I\u2019ve had in a long time. Let me finish,\u201d he interrupted Stiles before he could get a word out of his mouth, already wanting to argue back, \u201cThis is important to you. And it\u2019s nothing at all for me to make room in the carriage for you, too. And besides \u2013 I\u2019d be a terrible mess of nerves before asking Allison to marry me. I could really use the moral support.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo \u2013 technically, you\u2019re just taking advantage of my dream to bring me along as encouragement, right?\u201d Stiles quipped, his smile lopsided and a little hopeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight in one, my friend. Now \u2013 I suggest we finish up here quickly, and then figure out something to eat. I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not looking very happy,\u201d Laura observed, sitting in one of the delicate chintz chairs of the sitting room as Derek tramped through the hallway, \u201cOur esteemed head butler would pitch a right fit if he caught you traipsing mud through his spotless floors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarris be damned!\u201d Derek hissed back, tugging the scarf from around his neck with force, balling it up between his hands and creasing the delicate silk. \u201cTo hell with all of them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Enough is enough, Derek, there\u2019s no need for such language.\u201d Laura retorted, her tone stern enough to startle the fight out of him. He deflated immediately, crossing the room and collapsing into the chair beside hers. To her credit, Laura placed her bookmark delicately between the dog-eared pages and set the leather-bound hardback aside, before leaning over and folding her delicate hand over his calloused one. \u201cNow,\u201d she said in a much gentler, coaxing tone, \u201cWill you tell me what\u2019s upset you so? You only ever ride that hard when something\u2019s truly bothering you.\u201d She indicated with a nod of her head at Derek\u2019s mud-splattered riding boots, threadbare breeches and shirt and plain homespun tunic, what Cora kept dubbing his \u2018peasant garb\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s this accursed ball,\u201d Derek groused, glad that his eldest sister was completely uncaring of the state of his dress, or the dirt caking his skin \u2013 she\u2019d always been more level-headed and practical than Cora, who, in the last few years had developed virtually an obsession with parties, dresses and invites. \u201cEverywhere I turn, I keep seeing reminders of it coming. You know how much I dread going to the blasted thing. Every year, it\u2019s always the same \u2013 making boring conversations about hairstyles, dances, court life. It\u2019s just so \u2013 <em>ugh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI take it you received Lady Argent\u2019s invite for the picnic, then?\u201d Laura pried, and Derek flinched because she always knew just what bothered him, and never shied away from cutting to the quick of the issue.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, please, little brother,\u201d she scoffed, waving a hand dismissively. \u201cLike you don\u2019t know who sorts through the mail in the mornings. I can recognise that stationery anywhere, not to mention the Argent\u2019s wax seal on the invite. And you <em>have </em>been getting more of them as of late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly from <em>her</em>,\u201d Derek\u2019s lip curled in distaste, \u201cAnd I\u2019m almost certain that the only reason I\u2019ve stopped receiving any invites from anybody else is because she frightens the living daylights out of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMost people would consider such a \u2013 <em>confident</em> woman attractive. You know \u2013 self-assured and assertive enough to go after something she wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s frightful, that\u2019s what she is.\u201d Derek shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never encountered a woman like her in my life, and that\u2019s not a compliment, Laur. She honest to goodness frightens me. Every time I see her, she\u2019s staring at me as if I\u2019m a trophy to be won \u2013 and not in a good way, though, I say trophy as in \u2018<em>mount me on a wooden plaque and hang me above her family\u2019s fireplace</em>\u2019 type of trophy. It\u2019s getting more and more difficult not to shudder in her presence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCheer up, Der,\u201d Laura pushed on, \u201cYou know mother hosts these balls in the hopes of either you or Cora finding someone. That\u2019s how she found father, after all, and fell in blissful, divine love. And it is how I met Steven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut unlike me, Cora <em>likes</em> the parties,\u201d Derek insisted doggedly. \u201cHeaven knows why, but she does. She revels in getting dresses made, and powdering herself up like a doll, and swanning around the floor with her suitors. In all honesty, I think she\u2019s hoping to find herself a husband at the dance, though I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll be as foppish and materialistic as she.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that,\u201d his sister chided, though a playful grin tugged at her lips as she silently agreed on the materialistic vanity of their youngest sibling. \u201cSteven and I met two years ago, and we seem to be doing alright \u2013 even our engagement hasn\u2019t seemed to dampen our enjoyment of one another\u2019s company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you two are practically soulmates.\u201d He huffed out a breath, trying not to feel the stab of jealousy. \u201cYou\u2019re not like the other women in the court \u2013 you don\u2019t powder your hair or wear wigs, you don\u2019t care about dresses or jewellery or makeup. You don\u2019t believe water is <em>unhygienic </em>and drown yourself in perfume instead to block out the rancid smell of body odour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love to know who spread that rumour and throttle them,\u201d Laura giggled helplessly behind her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you <em>read</em> and hold conversations about <em>interesting things</em>,\u201d Derek pressed on, trying not to think of how his voice was taking on a distinctive whine. \u201cAnd Steven is an author and cares more about what\u2019s in your head than what\u2019s draped over your shoulders. I\u2019ve seen you two prattle on for hours about everything. I\u2019m just \u2013 alright, alright, I\u2019m envious of you and your fianc\u00e9. I want to find someone like that too, not just be pushed into a sham of a marriage just because we\u2019re second-cousins to the King, and the connection looks good on the family tree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find someone who\u2019s right for you, Derek. Mother and father wouldn\u2019t expect you to settle for anyone less,\u201d Laura patted his arm consolingly. Derek nodded back without enthusiasm, quick to rise from his chair and make a hasty retreat to his rooms when Harris\u2019 outraged screech at the state of the floors rang through the corridors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles sewed like a man possessed. Scott\u2019s suit was done in record time, and he spent hours in the evenings working on his own suit. The base outfit was finished, but his fastidious nature wouldn\u2019t let it be. The day before the ball, Scott was over, whistling through his teeth in appreciation of his suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is, by far, the most exquisite thing I\u2019ve ever seen you make, Stiles.\u201d He ran his hands reverently over his new outfit, tracing along the navy blue silk and gold braiding.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad you think so. It\u2019s cost you enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would gladly pay twice the amount for something like this. I could honestly see myself being married in such a suit \u2013 even buried. But let me see your ensemble, now! It is finished, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a flourish, Stiles brought out the dress form, with his suit hanging completed from its shape. It had been an effort and a half, that was for sure, long evenings after the store had closed spent carefully working by lamplight to get the details just right. As it was, Stiles couldn\u2019t have been any prouder. It was truly a marvellous creation \u2013 the silk had been costly, and it had been so hard to justify buying something like that for himself. But, honestly, Stiles was a man with few needs, and aside from the occasional treat, he\u2019s never really indulged in anything that wasn\u2019t essential. It was almost a God-given blessing that Scott had requested to ignore all other customers\u2019 orders, because there was no conceivable way he would have been able to finish both their suits <em>and </em>whatever other orders might have come his way.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright \u2013 I take the sentiment back,\u201d Scott whistled, impressed. \u201c<em>This</em> is the most exquisite thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Look at this \u2013 Stiles. This is superb.\u201d His eyes roved over the embroidery with admiration, taking in the delicate needlework of autumn-coloured foliage. \u201cThe amount of detail in this \u2013 Stiles, this is something the Royal Family itself would have in their wardrobes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFlattery gets you everywhere, Scott,\u201d the tailor reproached playfully, clapping a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThough I\u2019m not going to lie, this is my pride and joy. What do you think \u2013 is it worthy of the Hale ball?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than!\u201d his friend responded with keenness. \u201cI cannot wait for tomorrow evening \u2013 Mother is letting me use the good carriage for the night, you know the one, with black panelling and brass fixtures. It\u2019ll be quite a sight. I\u2019ve even picked up a mask for it downtown, look-\u201d He tore open the wrapped parcel on the counter to reveal the handsome visage of a hunting hound, made to the same midnight-blue colour as his suit. \u201cI\u2019m sure Allison will go as a bird \u2013 she\u2019s graceful and light as one. I thought it\u2019d be perfect, considering how I plan to ask to capture her hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClever,\u201d Stiles remarked, smirking.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a mask too? It is a masquerade, after all \u2013 we could always go down to the same store I bought mine at and get you one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 yes. I do have one.\u201d He went back to the cupboard and pulled out a mask of his own \u2013 it had been kept in one of the cupboards upstairs for years, a relic from his mother\u2019s crafting days that hadn't sold, and something he now treasured. It was a fox mask, made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and glue, one of the few that she\u2019d made that were animals rather than the handsome, androgynous faces that were so popular in Europe. The playful reddish tint picked up on the subtle hints of the same colour in the embroidery, ending in a pointed snout and clever, perked ears, decorated with gilded swirls. His mother had always called him a clever little fox, and the rich, autumnal colours were his favourite. It seemed only right to carry a little piece of her to his dreams, even if it was only for one evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic \u2013 we\u2019re all set!\u201d Scott packed his own mask away excitedly, hastily re-wrapping the parcel. \u201cI\u2019ll come by tomorrow afternoon, and we can dress together and eat something quick before we go \u2013 I hate going to events on an empty stomach, you never know what they\u2019ll serve there. I\u2019ll tell the coachman to pick us up at sundown, just as the party\u2019s started, so we can get there on time but not be <em>too</em> early, you know what I mean? Allison said she\u2019d be there at that time too \u2013 oh, but we need to return the carriage to my mother\u2019s just before one in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidnight? Isn\u2019t that a little early?\u201d Stiles inquired, brows rising. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the lights on at the mansion well into the early hours of the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say, mother wants the carriage back in one piece.\u201d The young Lord gave a noncommittal shrug. \u201cStill, it\u2019ll give us a solid few good hours there, and if we leave by midnight, I can get you dropped off back here, and have the carriage back at our place on time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds perfect,\u201d he grinned in reply, the excitement already causing his chest to flutter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d Derek muttered, standing awkwardly in front of the mirrors in the dressing room as the head tailor tugged the edge of his suit down, muttering approvingly as he smoothed the lines over his broad shoulders. Their mother had hired him and a squad of assistants from the capital, on loan from their royal cousins (and hadn't Cora practically <em>shrieked </em>with glee) to make their outfits for their party. And here he was, the day before the big event, making sure the final fitting for his clothes was done. Granted, it was far nicer than anything else he had in his wardrobe, but it still felt oppressive and excessive, compared to what he usually wore.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheer up, Derek,\u201d Laura sighed, breath hitching as a seamstress gave another hard tug onto her corset, almost causing her to fall over. \u201cA-at least you\u2019re not getting your organs compressed into p\u00e2t\u00e9 over there. Goodness \u2013 this dress is so heavy, I feel like I\u2019m toting an ox-cart around on my hips.\u201d She winced as the plump dresser <em>wedged her knee into the small of her back</em>, <em>how was that even safe</em>, and yanked on the corset strings hard enough to elicit another wheezy yelp.</p>\n<p>Derek had to agree that at least he got off lucky on the dress department, watching Laura scrabble uselessly at the back of one of the room\u2019s chairs as the older seamstress tugged her dress on. She always preferred the comfortable, simple cotton day dresses without corsetry or stomachers (every female in their family was naturally slight of frame)- however, it seemed that this year\u2019s fashion dictated an even more rigid silhouette. Derek was glad that at least he could move comfortably enough, without fear of knocking a table over with the edge of an enormous hooped skirt. He refrained from mentioning how absurd the wide skirts were, at least to Laura \u2013 she was his favourite sister, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just unused to the higher fashions of the capital,\u201d Cora sniffed primly on his other side, turning this way and that to admire herself in the mirror. While Laura\u2019s new dress, though much larger in size to her regular ones, seemed to match her easy-going personality, Cora\u2019s was entirely on the other end of the spectrum. Unlike Laura\u2019s cream-coloured floral gown, his younger sister\u2019s was bedecked in ribbons and lace, rosettes and flounces gathering up multitudes of ruched panelling. Her hoop was much wider than Laura\u2019s (he guessed the fashion implied that bigger was, supposedly, better), and the searing combination of salmon-pink, ice-blue and silver of the layers, covered in embroidered flowers, made his eyes hurt. Cora seemed to adore it, though, cooing with glee as she smoothed down the ruffled lace of her sleeves.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like an oversized meringue cake,\u201d he commented snidely, watching her preen. At least Laura still retained a vaguely humanoid shape.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called <em>fashion</em>, Derek, something you wouldn\u2019t know if it bit you on the backside,\u201d Cora returned just as nastily, trying to decide between two seemingly identical hairpieces bedecked with lace, silk flowers and miniature birds. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not stuck looking like a pompous idiot all my life, unlike <em>some</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their sniping argument was abruptly cut short by a loud crash, and they both leaned over to see Laura crumpled to the ground, her billowing skirts up around her ears as she scowled, seeming decidedly put-out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize fashion didn\u2019t make room for breathing <em>or</em> moving,\u201d she muttered darkly, trying to pick herself up off the floor and failing, coming across less regal and more like an upturned turtle. Derek chuckled, raised his eyes heavenwards and prayed with every ounce of faith he\u2019d been brought up to have that his sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 would never, <em>ever </em>let someone like her go. And, while he was at it, he also threw in a prayer or two for the accursed evening to pass without incident.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It felt as though Stiles had hardly a wink of sleep before he was up the next morning, setting the shop in order. He was closed for the day, a gift to himself for stretching his work hours so far out to get his suit done. Nevertheless, time seemed to both crawl and fly by. One moment he was breaking his fast, foot tapping nervously against the skirting board as he surveyed the chaos that had turned his usually tidy workshop into a sty, and the next he was tidying with a mad fervour, shoving scraps of useless silk in the trash bin and sweeping loose threads into the dustpan. And suddenly the morning was gone, and though the workshop was a sight cleaner than before, Stiles needed to get clean and ready because <em>heaven\u2019s above, he was going to the Hale ball.</em></p>\n<p>The very first thing Stiles did was draw a bath from the pump behind the house, because his parents had always been sticklers for cleanliness, and he couldn\u2019t imagine putting on his brand new suit while smelling of exertion and sweat. He scrubbed his skin almost raw, used more soap than he ever had at one time in his life, and by the time dusk was falling, his suit was laid out, ready to put on, his shoes were polished to a shine bordering on absurd, his hair was dry, combed, and as styled as it was ever going to be (and it was behaving itself quite admirably, considering he didn\u2019t have a powdered periwig). His hair was, indeed, cropped too short for the fashion, but he supposed that it\u2019d have to do, and regardless, Lord Scott\u2019s hair was only slightly longer than his, so he doubted that he\u2019d be the only one wearing his natural hair.</p>\n<p>Scott came over soon after, bringing with him a large plate of sliced meat and a crusty loaf of bread (\u201cThe cooks wouldn\u2019t let me leave without food, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t seem to realize I eat <em>all the time,</em>\u201d), and they spent the better part of an hour raiding the cupboards for condiments and putting together increasingly large towers of food. It was a fantastic way to begin an evening, and the mood was light-hearted and jovial as they helped each other to dress. Scott was incredibly low-maintenance and actually knew how to dress on his own, something Stiles had hardly ever witnessed a noble do, and even helped him tie the sash across his own suit. All too soon, they piled into Scott\u2019s awaiting carriage, on their way to the Hale manor for the ball.</p>\n<p>Stiles felt \u2013 well, the entire lead up to this day felt exciting, but he found himself an erratic, jumbling bundle of nerves. He could feel his palms sweating beneath the fine linen of his embroidered gloves, and was glad for the mask perched upon his face, because while it was easy to return the excitable grin of his noble friend beside him, he was starting to regret eating that third sandwich. Everything felt a little bizarre, from the velvet of the cushions underneath him, to the echoing clop of the horses\u2019 hooves as they trotted merrily down the cobbled streets. Stiles mentally gave up a prayer of thanks that the evening was still a little cool, because had it been any warmer he would have sweated his body weight through with nerves.</p>\n<p>All too soon, they arrived at the manor, and it took all of his willpower not to peek through the curtained windows to ogle the lush grounds like a commoner. There\u2019d be plenty of time to take in the sights afterwards, he simply had to make sure he didn\u2019t frighten himself before arriving at the courtyard, and lose his wits altogether. Scott, who had spent the ride animatedly rehearsing the speech with which he planned to woo his bride-to-be, seemed to be no less enthused as the coachman opened the door of the carriage, despite looking slightly green around the gills. It comforted Stiles a little to know that even nobles sometimes felt a rush of anxiety before an event, and, reassured that he wasn\u2019t the only one that felt as though he were walking into the mouth of Hell itself, gave his friend a solid squeeze on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter you, my Lord,\u201d he smirked, rewarded with a playful shove back as Scott pushed him towards the door first. It was a feat of agility in itself that he managed to climb out of the carriage with his long legs in a fashion graceful enough to not snap his neck in twain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels even more oppressive than usual,\u201d Derek murmured to his eldest sister as the party, now in full swing, went on around them. Beside him, tucked away in the corner of the ballroom, Laura looked almost equally as miserable as he. She was clutching a crystal champagne flute and appearing pale behind her half mask, a simple fa\u00e7ade of silk and cream ribbon. It contrasted beautifully with her dark hair and crimson lips, the only cosmetic she\u2019d deigned to wear for the night.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad for the masks, though,\u201d she replied, \u201cIf I had to hear one more time about the Hale daughters and their \u2018natural handsomeness free from powders\u2019, I would have screamed.\u201d She took a mouthful of the sparkling wine and sighed. \u201cCora seems to be enjoying herself, though.\u201d She gestured with a gloved hand at their sister, laughing and merrily spinning on the dance floor with a handsome youth, glittering and dazzling like a butterfly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t judge her for it,\u201d Derek observed, looking put out. \u201cShe was right about what she said this morning over breakfast. I don\u2019t know how to have any fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s just being petty. I think you\u2019re plenty of fun, Der. Who else am I supposed to talk to about my views on women in society? Who else is going to indulge me when I decide to wax poetic about the latest paperback that father brought back from his travels? You\u2019re plenty of fun, it\u2019s just \u2013 society right now seems interested in a \u2013 a <em>different</em> sort of fun from ours. One that\u2019s a little less intellectual and a little more-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNarcissistic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was <em>going </em>to say flighty,\u201d she admonished, hiding a smile behind her hand, \u201cBut perhaps you\u2019re right in more ways that others would care to admit. Still \u2013 you\u2019re a lovely young man, little brother. You simply have to find someone who will look past your-\u201d She gestured at his brooding face, covered by the sullen countenance of a half-face wolf mask, \u201c-your ruminating mien.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy \u2018<em>ruminating mien\u2019</em>? You mean to say my perpetually affixed scowl, if you wish to borrow Cora\u2019s words.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish to do no such thing. Now, I think I see Chancellor Barry over there, he and I were supposed to talk about father\u2019s donation to support one of the new colleges in town.\u201d She set her empty flute down on a passing waiter\u2019s tray and straightened her gloves. \u201cI\u2019m giving you fair warning that Lady Argent is here with her young niece, and last I heard they had split up. Apparently, Lady Allison is searching for one of her suitors in particular. If you\u2019re attempting to avoid the other, she\u2019s wearing a ghastly violet gown with black trim, and has a black mask with red stones on the front.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real gem, Laura,\u201d he sighed gratefully, picking up a glass of wine for his own from a passing tray and cradling it between his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know. Now, attempt to make at least two conversations before I return, and if we\u2019ve both had enough by then, we can call it a night and tell mother we tried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLord McCall and family, from Beacon Hall!\u201d came the shout from the herald as he and Scott stepped across the threshold of the palatial mansion. Stiles already began to feel slightly ill \u2013 he knew that it would take some time to get adjusted to the <em>idea</em> that he was here, but now that he was, everything seemed so much more daunting as he was experiencing it. It felt like a mad rush, and, as they made their way through the lantern-lined entryway and inside, Stiles became completely and utterly overwhelmed. The Hale manor was resplendent with candle-lit crystal chandeliers, casting the expansive ballroom in a glittering shower of flickering light. The walls, covered in dainty gold filigree, cast the luminosity back, which caught off the jewels and shiny buttons of the people inside, chatting on the sidelines or twirling in the middle of the marbled floor to fast-paced, tinkling music from the stringed ensemble on the dais. Long tables were stretched out between the floor-to-ceiling glass doors open to the brisk night air outside, covered in lace cloths and piles high with ornate sweetmeats and dainty, appetising food.</p>\n<p>And the people! Stiles stood stock-still for a long moment, mesmerised at the sight as if from a dream. Never before had he seen so many lavish gowns and suits in one place, the women exquisite as exotic birds, flitting about daintily as the patterned silks of their dresses swished with rich sounds about them. The men wore both suits and the heavier cassocks, their braid and embroidery glinting in the luminosity of the night as they strutted in heels and boots, stately and proud as capons. The masks on their faces completed the look, some animals and fantastical beasts, some the genderless faces so popular in Italy and Venice. If Stiles hadn't known he was awake and in that room, he would have had no misgivings in thinking it was all part of a magnificent dream.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see her! I see her, Stiles, look!\u201d Scott spoke from beside him all of a sudden, pushing on his shoulder and gesturing to the far corner. Indeed, at one end of a table stood a lovely young lady in an emerald-coloured dress, with a feathered mask on her delicately-featured face. Stiles was more than a little impressed that his friend had been able to recognise his lady-love from an entire roomful of <em>masked</em> people, but then again, not much had been crossing the young Lord\u2019s mind as of late aside from thoughts of her.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d he urged, jerking his chin towards her direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about you? We just arrived, I can\u2019t leave you on your own!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott, tonight is important for both of us, I completely agree,\u201d he held his hands out, palm downwards in a placating gesture, \u201cBut this moment is far more important for you than I. Not to mention I\u2019ll have to be the one to hear about it for the rest of my days if it doesn\u2019t happen. Go forth and conquer, my friend, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Scott looked sheepish, which, in turn, made his face, in addition to the mask, look even more adorably chastened than normal.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. Now, best of luck,\u201d he clapped him on the back heartily, meaning every word, \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t see you for a while, I\u2019ll see you outside at the carriage at midnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. The Hales have a grandfather clock that strikes the hour very loudly, so no doubt both of us will hear it. I\u2019ll see you soon \u2013 enjoy the party!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry not to make a fool of yourself in the meantime!\u201d he laughed, only to be met with the hastily retreating back of his friend. He sighed, squared his shoulder and stepped out into the glittering room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek had been at the party for almost two hours, and he still hadn't found anything worth staying for. He\u2019d carefully avoided Lady Argent as he saw her making her rounds of the dance floor searching for someone (he\u2019d bet his finest horse it was him), and had followed Laura\u2019s advice to attempt conversation with other people. A good twenty minutes were wasted with Lord Hiferth in discussing his mother\u2019s choice of canap\u00e9s and music. Derek had (foolishly) thought that perhaps he\u2019d be able to spend a lot more of his time with young Lord Guilford, as he was as much of a riding enthusiast as anybody he\u2019d met. But alas, it was not meant to be \u2013 they\u2019d discussed at great lengths the better makers of stirrups and bridles, but his (slightly too young to be proper) wife had pulled him away to discuss politics with a few of her friends, and there was no chance that Derek would even <em>venture</em> into that subject, not with his forthright manner of speaking.</p>\n<p>Laura had finished speaking with the Chancellor, but, as luck would have it, her fianc\u00e9 had returned early from his trip and had come to the party to surprise her. The three of them had talked at great lengths about the latest English translation of Antoine Galland\u2019s <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, of which he\u2019d been an avid reader, and had finally, mercifully, been able to contribute to the conversation with. But then Steven had brought up Oliver Goldsmith\u2019s latest work, <em>The Vicar of Wakefield</em>, and the two of them were off, speaking at an excited, hurried pace about the different interpolations of literary genres within. Laura was scathing in the way the book was written as a fictitious memoir, and Derek was well and truly lost by then. Steven was looking at Laura in a way that was completely besotted and (in his opinion) slightly nauseating, so he graciously stepped back and left the two love birds at it.</p>\n<p>Thank goodness he had eaten dinner beforehand, he mused, because he was picking up his second glass of wine from a waiter\u2019s tray, and, had he come here with an empty stomach, he would be well and truly gone by the end of the night. Well, at the rate he was going, anyhow. He scanned the crowd again, hoping to find a familiar face to converse with (a little more difficult, considering everyone was wearing masks) when something caught his attention and held it. A young man, skirting the edges of the room as if trying to keep all attention away from him, clad in a russet, silk suit and a fox mask. Everybody seemed not to notice him, but something about the youth\u2019s posture, the way he carried himself, the manner in which he cradled the champagne flute between his gloved fingers, seemed to transfix the entirety of Derek\u2019s awareness.</p>\n<p>Without realizing it, Derek was following him avidly with his eyes, taking note of how he moved \u2013 a little hesitantly, as if he didn\u2019t quite belong, but with an odd sort of grace. His body was lean, but firm, shoulders broad and waist slender, a charming silhouette only emphasised by the excellent cut of his suit. It wasn\u2019t the most fashionable garment in the room, not when many had tailors employed by the King, but from halfway across the room it looked splendid. He found his body slowly gravitating towards the youth, gradually and unhurriedly, watching fervently as the other seemed content to sip at his champagne slowly and watch the other partygoers dance.</p>\n<p>Before he knew it, he was standing beside the young man, and Derek was glad for the mask, because somehow his pulse was beating loudly enough in his ears to be heard over the music. From this distance, he could see the other\u2019s coat, which was simply cut, as he\u2019d first thought, but delicately embroidered with autumn leaves, matching what appeared to be a large beech tree emblazoned in needlepoint on the waistcoat underneath. Paired with the gilded fox mask, he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to learn the young man was some sort of enrapturing woodland nymph, or an entrancing <em>jinn</em> from <em>Arabian Nights</em>. The youth turned his face towards him, first looking at his hand clasped around his glass, and then dragging slowly upwards until their eyes met. He didn\u2019t say anything at first, seemingly dumbfounded, and then, as if remembering his manners, the corners of his lips drew up a little. Derek would swear on any religious book that he felt his heart leap up into his chest at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d the other spoke, and <em>oh</em>, the sound of his voice was sweeter than the candied fruit he\u2019d tasted just a little while ago. At this proximity, he could see the youth\u2019s eyes behind the fox mask were an alluring shade of amber, matching his outfit almost perfectly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening to you,\u201d he found himself saying, voice a little gruffer than he intended it to be. He swallowed nervously, and gestured with indifference to the dance floor mere feet away with his wineglass. \u201cYou\u2019re not dancing tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve not \u2013 I\u2019m happy to just watch, really,\u201d the youth beside him spoke quickly, the hand not holding his flute waving dismissively with a little too much gusto. \u201cI don\u2019t have a dance partner here, you see, I\u2019ve come with my \u2013 my cousin, and right now he\u2019s off wooing his ladylove, and besides, dancing doesn\u2019t interest me much, not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hid a smile behind the action of taking another sip of wine. Had Laura been standing beside them, listening to their conversation, she would have undoubtedly made a comment. He could hear her voice, clear as day in his head, muttering \u2018<em>The lady doth protest too much, methinks</em>\u2019 with a grin. He must have been giddier than he previously thought, or perhaps his almost-two glasses of wine were making him braver than usual, because with surprising speed he plucked the other man\u2019s glass from his hands, and settled both of them on a passing tray.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve no one to dance with, I\u2019ll gladly be your partner,\u201d he said, feeling an unusual confidence he hadn't possessed before from the safety beneath his mask. He reached out his hand, glad for all the dancing lessons his mother had insisted on, because if he wasn\u2019t completely certain he could waltz in his sleep, he wouldn\u2019t have had the conviction to ask otherwise. \u201cWould you care to dance with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since stepping into the ballroom, Stiles had felt like he\u2019d stumbled into a dream landscape, impossibly rich and splendid beyond anything he could conceivably imagine. And yet, despite wearing clothes just as sumptuous as some of them, he still felt like an outsider that didn\u2019t belong. Regardless of his fine suit, he knew that his social standing was infinitesimal at best, ludicrous at worst. Devoid of all confidence as he gazed around the room, Stiles felt as though he were a pigeon in a cage full of peacocks.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d managed to keep to himself for the better part of an hour or so, he estimated, before he felt the strange, prickling sensation on the back of his neck, the sensation of being watched. Discreetly, he cast his eyes around the room and saw, from the corner of his eye, a solitary figure standing behind one of the marble pillars, oddly motionless in a room of dancing and merriment. From across the room, the man seemed to be hardly more than a shadow, standing in the shade of the support. He thought nothing of it, but, unavoidably, found himself casting a glance back at the other from time to time. The figure didn\u2019t seem to move for a long, long time, but it seemed that, before Stiles knew it, they were standing side by side.</p>\n<p>The first thing Stiles noticed, before all else, were the man\u2019s gloves. He was grasping a crystal glass of blood-red wine, and he somehow couldn\u2019t seem to look away. In his time, Stiles had made numerous pairs of gloves, and he above all people could appreciate the difficulty it took to make them, the detail that can go into something people consider so trivial. The fourchette between the fingers of the other man\u2019s gloves were sewn in so precisely that the stitches were near invisible, and the trank plain, but styled incredibly well, cut to the wrist at the perfect measurement to match his sleeve length. There were rosettes and fleur-de-lis embroidered onto the linen, in a shade of white so well matched that, had Stiles not been looking, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed at all. It spoke of a man who wasn\u2019t ostentatious in his tastes, who enjoyed fine detail without being grandiose in presentation.</p>\n<p>As if pulled by a mysterious force of gravity, his gaze was dragged upwards, over the sleeve that was fitted perfectly to accentuate the man\u2019s strong physique, across the expanse of torso that was resplendent in silver embroidery, whorls of silvery chrysanthemums along a collar fitted, here and there, with metal buttons. The effect of the silver thread contrasted strikingly against the velvet backdrop of the suit\u2019s dark black, catching the light enchantingly. Stiles took the sight in, from the man\u2019s closely-cropped inky hair and dark shadow of facial hair, to the sombre, very nearly sullen mask of the wolf obscuring his face. But what really shocked Stiles were the man\u2019s eyes, a stark difference to the gentleman\u2019s entire appearance. Where he\u2019d expected them to be as sable as the rest of him, Stiles was entranced by the other\u2019s jewel-like tone, juxtaposing the darkness of the mask. All the air seemed to leave his body at once, because the sum of all the other man\u2019s parts, the breadth of his shoulders, the way the coat fits him and his amazing, light-coloured eyes, made his chest constrict in a strange, almost painful way.</p>\n<p>He hadn't realized how brazenly he\u2019d been staring until the silence had stretched awkwardly between them, and, thankfully, he remembered his manners in time to extend a greeting. It was returned easily enough, and, for a moment, he believed it to be the end of that particular interaction. But without warning the masked man began conversing with him, and Stiles \u2013 well, he felt surprised that someone seemed to have taken an interest in him, even if it was on such a banal subject as dancing. When asked about the reason he\u2019s not on the floor, all the breath is knocked out of him. He chattered on quickly, looking around in the hopes of finding Scott, certain that he\u2019d been too obvious and had been found out.</p>\n<p>When his glass was taken from his hand and he was offered to dance, Stiles \u2013 well, to be frank, he was flabbergasted. He stood immobile, rooted to the spot as if petrified, while the other masked man stood, patiently, with his hand still outstretched.</p>\n<p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d the stranger repeated, his voice soft and gently insistent. And, despite standing nowhere near a wall, Stiles felt cornered and abruptly shy. Regardless of that, he found that he didn\u2019t want to refuse the urgings of the man, whether it be to try and throw suspicion from himself or to admit that, regardless of the fact he didn\u2019t know this man at all and he seemed a little peculiar, he had a remarkably enigmatic nature. He couldn\u2019t deny the allure of him, not when his multi-coloured eyes seemed to shine behind his dark mark with such sincere aspiration. Before he knew it, he\u2019d placed his hand tentatively in the wolf\u2019s outstretched own, who grasped it almost instantly, pulling Stiles close to him and leading him into the centre of the dancing, lively crowd. Suddenly, Stiles felt a nervous mess. He\u2019d never danced properly before at a ball, only with the mannequins of his shop which, to be expected, were poor dance partners and didn\u2019t provide reliable practice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to dance well,\u201d he whispered, feeling an embarrassed flush creep into his cheeks. The man\u2019s lips, soft and full beneath the half-visage of the wolf, worked up into a slightly playful smirk, completely devoid of malice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to worry, little fox. I will lead you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s hands came down, one resting on the flat of his back, the other catching his hand. Stiles swallowed heavily, trying to dislodge what felt like an entire brick in his throat as he placed his free hand on the man\u2019s strong, broad shoulder.</p>\n<p>And just like that, they were moving.</p>\n<p>It was like something out of a child\u2019s fairy-tale, being spun on the floor surrounded by rustling silk and gleeful, chirping laughter, the string ensemble\u2019s music filling his ears and the lights from the hundreds of lit candles whirling around him. It\u2019s only after a few moments that Stiles became comfortable with himself enough to let the sound of the music into him, giving up all apprehension as he let the wolf take the lead. It\u2019s a little clumsy at first, especially considering that they\u2019re very nearly of the same height, but soon enough their motions align in synchronisation, and he realizes that he\u2019s laughing delightedly. The man behind the wolf mask steers their movements with grace borne of practice, and smiles at him in return.</p>\n<p>They began moving a little faster as the music increased in rhythm, its pace building. Stiles couldn\u2019t remember a time when he\u2019d last had so much excitement, spellbound by the environment he\u2019d somehow entered and the way the other man\u2019s hands held onto him so closely, leading him with sureness. The tempo of the melody builds higher and higher as their feet dance into a whirlwind of crescendo, and he\u2019s glad for the sensation of those strong, sure hands, because he feels as though he might lift off his feet at any moment and fly away.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>The question startles Stiles from his rapturous exhilaration, but before he\u2019s had a chance to process it, the band swings into a near raucous, boisterous climax, and the other man presses his hand firmly against the small of his back, grips his hand harder and leans forward, dipping him backwards. Stiles fights his body\u2019s natural reaction to flail his arms wildly in shock, instead surprising himself by scrambling to wind his other hand around the man\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>It suddenly feels as though all sense of time and space have slowed to a complete standstill, where only the two of them seem to have been spared. All of his senses seemed to be hyperaware and focused solely on his dance partner, cataloguing every fibre of the moment, from the slightly soapy, fresh, masculine scent of his skin, to the honeyed-gold ring around his pupil bleeding into the dazzling array of hues of his eyes. Their breathing hard and heavy from the exertive dance steps, Stiles couldn\u2019t help the way his hold instinctively tightened around the man\u2019s neck, bringing their faces a half inch closer. The other\u2019s eyes widened a touch, then flicked downwards at his mouth, and then \u2013</p>\n<p>The moment ended with the sound of clapping from around them, as the dancers swirled to a stop and applauded the musicians. The taller man pulled him back into an upright stance, and they broke apart hastily, Stiles\u2019 chest heaving with exertion, the wolf\u2019s facial emotions unreadable because of the mask. Clearing his throat and feeling heat throughout his entire body, he made to turn and leave, but the masked man caught his wrist, impeding his exodus from the dance floor, where another tune was already beginning and the guests were partnering again in preparation. Desperately, Stiles tried to find words that made sense of his bewildered, frazzled mind, or the way that his heart seemed to still beat too fast, despite the dance being long over.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was \u2013 I\u2019m feeling rather too warm,\u201d he stumbled instead, the heat of the other\u2019s fingers almost like a brand upon his wrist, even though there were multiple layers of cloth between them. \u201cI thought I might \u2013 step outside. For a brief moment, that is.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man grunted in response, a soft sound that he barely heard over the clamour of the next dance beginning. His grip loosened on Stiles\u2019 wrist, however, and travelled down to take Stiles\u2019 hand within his gloved own. He was pulled forward, following the stranger as he led them across to the edge of the ballroom, and then through opulent gilt doors that opened to the cool night breeze of outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Stiles asked, still feeling a little breathless.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you before,\u201d replied the man, casting a small smile over his shoulder as they walked, \u201cThat I would lead you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek had obviously been taught how to dance \u2013 it was one of the many lessons he\u2019d rigorously learned as a child, and then had to grudgingly keep up with as an adult to retain. He\u2019d never felt right, especially when practicing with Laura or Cora, both who were light as butterflies and nimble on their toes, making him feel like a heavy-footed troll by comparison.</p>\n<p>He hadn't known what possessed him to request a dance from the fox-masked youth. It had been clear as day, even with the mask on his face, that the young man was looking at the dance floor with an air of longing. And, if Derek had to be perfectly frank with himself, he wanted nothing more in that moment than to spend as long as he could in the company of the other. He hadn't expected at all for his offer to be accepted, not when Cora had laughed at his mask, declaring with a delighted face that it was just as frightening and intimidating as his face on a regular day. But when the youth slipped his hand, just a touch hesitantly, into Derek\u2019s outstretched one, he had to fight hard to keep his face from breaking into an elated grin.</p>\n<p>Dancing with the young man was \u2013 different, to say the least, from dancing with his sisters. For one, they were more or less of a height, though his body was obviously broader. It was easy to see the youth was inexperienced at dancing, more so with a partner, and yet his clumsy moves seemed to synchronise with Derek\u2019s own smooth, practiced steps, until they slid into a sort-of harmonized grace that worked for both of them. Derek could say with absolute honesty that it was the most enjoyable dance of his life, especially when the other tilted his head back and laughed delightedly. And if his hand against his partner\u2019s waist tightened a fraction as they spun in time to the fast-paced jig being played, well, it was nobody\u2019s business but his own.</p>\n<p>It felt as though it was all too soon when the music ceased, and Derek could see the magic of the moment between them slipping away as discomfiture overtook the young man. Even as he stepped away, something like fear overcame him, and unthinkingly his hand shot out, catching the other by the wrist. It was quite an indecorous action, but the thought that, after that wonderful dance, he might not see the young man again, well, it was very nearly too much to bear. Derek couldn\u2019t be sure if his dance partner\u2019s need for fresh air was an excuse to be rid of him or not, and, in any erstwhile situation, he would have wordlessly walked away to save himself the embarrassment or rejection, or apologized for taking a hold of his wrist so thoughtlessly. But there was something to be said about the anonymity of the mask he wore, and the peculiar feeling of confidence that came alongside it. And, acting impulsively on this tide of newfound daring, he took the other\u2019s hand and led him outside. If the young man wanted nothing more than fresh air, and he was wrong in his approach, well, he could always express his regret later with another few glasses of wine before retiring for the night. He had nothing to lose, really.</p>\n<p>Derek had to concede that Harris took his position as head butler of their household with acute seriousness, because the gardens of the estate looked just as picturesque as the inside. There were multitudes of tall, gilded candelabras at arbitrary points of the lawn, which cast a soft, warm light over the trimmed hedges. The slightly perfumed wax of the candles lightly scented the air, already made sweet by the faint perfume of his mother\u2019s favourite climbing roses, their vines delicately wrapped around the marble pillars and arches of the courtyard. Although beautiful in its calmness, the green was deserted by the merrymaking nobles inside, all too caught up in dancing and wine to enjoy the night air. And though the evening breeze was crisp, almost chilly, it was a pleasant change from the growing stuffiness of the ballroom, and couldn\u2019t diminish the beauty of the place.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d said the man beside him, and Derek had only then realized that he was still clutching at the other\u2019s hand. Hastily, he took his own away, but watched intently as the fox-masked youth smiled broadly from under his disguise, the slightly tense set of his shoulders easing just a touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI must admit,\u201d Derek ventured, his hands clasped behind his back as they began to walk together, a slow, sure pace, \u201cI was actually hoping to find an excuse to get away from that room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you too?\u201d the fox asked, as a melodic chuckle tumbled from his soft mouth. \u201cIt was \u2013 don\u2019t misunderstand me, it\u2019s a wonderful party. I\u2019ve never seen such wondrous things, or heard such lovely music being played in front of me. But I was beginning to feel a little overwhelmed, especially with -\u201d He suddenly seemed to catch his words, reining in whatever words he was about to speak, and Derek found himself undeniably curious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t assume I\u2019ll think any less of you for your opinions,\u201d he said unconcernedly, their unhurried pace through the gardens a welcome respite from the fast dancing. \u201cMy sisters often tell me that my opinions are wildly unpopular, most probably because I seem to have no problem in pointing out the truth. For instance,\u201d he turned his head a little and gave a small smile, \u201cI think those periwigs that men wear look absolutely absurd. It makes them look as if they\u2019re wearing a sheep on their crown.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of <em>course</em> Derek would have to put his foot in his mouth and tell one of his no-nonsense, frank opinions on the preposterousness of court life. According to Cora, it was this factor that was his chief downfall in trying to find someone who could bear his company for more than a handful of minutes (which came a close second to his supposedly constant glower). He\u2019d lost more than a few conversation partners almost the instant he\u2019d voiced his first thought, and he was more than expecting the other to turn on his heel and walk back the way they\u2019d come, possibly at a brisk pace to put as much distance between them as possible. What he <em>hadn't </em>expected was the fox to throw his head back and laugh, the sound bright and dazzling, completely charming.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m <em>so</em> glad I\u2019m not the only one who thinks like that!\u201d he returned, voice full of mirth. \u201cTo be fair, I was beginning to get a frightful headache from the reek of perfume inside. I suppose that a lot of the noble ladies enjoy smelling like flowers, but when they completely forego bathing and drench themselves in the stuff \u2013 well, it\u2019s not so much a bouquet as an explosion of vegetation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForego bathing?\u201d Derek repeated, feeling his eyebrows rise in curiosity behind his wolf face. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean they don\u2019t bathe daily.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey believe it to be unsanitary,\u201d the other chuckled, and Derek surprised himself with a sudden bark of astonished laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMadness. These people are utterly mad,\u201d he mused, and saw his companion grin and nod in reply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite being silent at first as they made their way through the picturesque gardens, Stiles soon found himself deep in conversation with the wolf-masked man. It was surprisingly informal and effortless to talk to him, the discussion as natural and uncomplicated as any he\u2019d had before with Scott. It began with their tongue-in-cheek observations of the nonsensicality of the nobles, and then the topics naturally progressed, from which books they preferred to read (he delighted in finding out his walking companion read mythical tales as well) to whatever Stiles could think of.</p>\n<p>And even if the other was dressed to the nines like a king, there was something about the man that seemed down-to-earth and genuine, that contradicted his exceptional couture and poise. The way he spoke about his love of horse riding seemed unconcerned, even speaking about how his sisters teased him for trailing mud through the house \u2013 well, Stiles could say with all certainty that he was feeling enchanted with his mystery friend and his intelligent humour and outlook on life.</p>\n<p>So they talked, on and on, and Stiles couldn\u2019t have said how long they\u2019d been outside, but the brisk air had long ago taken away whatever heat he\u2019d accrued in the stuffy ballroom. He was glad for his overcoat and multiple layers beneath his vest, because the temperature had dropped \u2013 not enough for it to be bitterly cold, but definitely chillier than it had been before. He attempted to suppress a shiver, though it didn\u2019t seem to work, as the other man fixed him with a look from behind his disguise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>They were in one of the garden\u2019s miniature hedge mazes, taking a break from their aimless meandering and sitting on the edge of a stone fountain in the centre of the maze, aquatic lilies and floating candles adorning the surface of the water. Some light was spilling still from the ballroom, but in the quiet haven of the garden, the din from the ball was muted, the light sparse and flickering in the cool night air from the candles and the soft moonlight in the clear night sky overhead.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d he replied, because, yes, he was feeling a little chilled, but nothing he hadn't felt before during winter when he hadn't had enough firewood to stave off the chill, or when he\u2019d been caught without a coat in early Spring. \u201cI\u2019d rather stay out here than go back inside \u2013 trying to navigate a safe path between all those crinolines crushing against one another is bound to end in tears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could lend you a coat,\u201d offered the stranger, and somehow the suggestion brought heat into his cheeks and the tips of his ears. He wasn\u2019t a young girl, he had absolutely no reason to blush at such a thing, and yet, there he was, glad for the cover of the mask to hide his reddened cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt \u2013 it\u2019s quite alright,\u201d he stumbled, \u201cThough I am grateful for the offer. I suppose it\u2019s best to get back inside, though, the air is starting to get a little chilly.\u201d He rubbed his gloved palms together, the friction causing a little warmth at least.\u00a0 \u201cWe may have to battle our way through the throng of partygoers, especially if we\u2019re trying to avoid the dance floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy ever would you want to do such a thing?\u201d his conversation companion asked, the hint of a grin on his face, \u201cYou seemed perfectly fine when we spun on there a while ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly because I had a dance partner who knew what they were doing,\u201d Stiles quipped back, chuckling. \u201cAt one point, I was pretty sure I held onto your shoulder for dear life when you steered us around, and I almost got crushed by that enormous woman who looked like a cream confection.\u201d They both laughed, the memory light between them. \u201cIn all honesty, I wasn\u2019t expecting such a fast-paced dance to begin with. It certainly takes a lot to keep up with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, come on,\u201d the wolf stood, offering his hand to Stiles again. \u201cLet\u2019s dance again before we go back inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha- out here?\u201d He glanced around, curiously. They were cut off from the courtyard by the hedge maze, completely alone save for the sounds of music and partying from over the manicured bushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d the other returned, his voice light. \u201cI was always told that a gentleman can dance anywhere.\u201d Stiles slipped his hand into the man\u2019s without a moment\u2019s hesitation, pulled to his feet as the music wafted over the shrubbery. However, the melody had changed into a slow, gentle waltz, full of string instruments and gentle harmonies.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s not as fast-paced as the prior one we danced to,\u201d Stiles noted out loud, his expression not quite even with the faintest hint of trepidation and his back stiff. And yet, before Stiles could gather his senses enough to deem it a bad idea, the other has wound his hands around him, and he could feel the warmth from the wolf\u2019s broad hand against the small of his back again. The difference in their position from their earlier dance was more intimate, their bodies closer and their chests pressed flush together.</p>\n<p>\u201cWaltzes are usually slower than jigs,\u201d the man smiled, though not unkindly. And then they were moving again, though their steps were far more leisurely than before. Once again, his companion seemed to be an excellent dance partner, steering them both through the waltz with near effortless grace. Their shared body heat seemed to be enough to make him forget the chilled night air completely. They moved together for what felt like an indeterminate amount of time, long enough that Stiles\u2019 rigid posture relaxed, and he sunk nearer to the wolf\u2019s touch. In reply, the other man\u2019s fingers spread out against his back, tugging him impossibly closer, their faces almost touching and lips sharing the same air. Stiles, his eyes firmly glued to the other\u2019s cravat for the longest time, hazarded a glance upwards, and was met by the unbelievably powerful gaze of the taller man, regarding him with his green-opal-coloured irises. And, once their eyes met, Stiles could not, for the life of him, seem to tear his own gaze away. At any prior time, he would have turned away self-consciously, or spewed a nervous babble of speech to hide his discomfort. The most peculiar thing, though, was that, for once, Stiles found himself brave enough to meet those eyes straight-on. Perhaps it was the sweet music, or the glass of expensive wine he\u2019d imbibed, or the gentle pressure of the man\u2019s touch against his spine. Whatever the case, they were level enough to feel the gentleman\u2019s breath against his cheek from beneath his mask.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould I-\u201d the other began, a little hesitantly, as if searching for the right words to say. \u201cIt might sound improper, but would you \u2013 could I perhaps \u2013 dance with you without gloves?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all that Stiles could say, feeling a little confused. To him, it didn\u2019t sound improper at all, as he rarely wore gloves, but maybe the nobles had a different idea of what proper etiquette was. Regardless, he found himself saying \u201cOf course,\u201d and pulled back a touch, enough to slip his gloves off and tuck them into the pocket of his vest. The stranger did the same, and when they met again in the middle, Stiles found his hand searching for the other\u2019s immediately, the heat of his partner\u2019s virtually scorching by comparison. He didn\u2019t even think to feel self-conscious of his calloused fingertips, not when the hand holding his was equally as rough-skinned across the fingertips. The moment felt just about too perfect and personal.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this-?\u201d he whispered, his skin tingling and buzzing where it held the other\u2019s hand. He felt quite drunk, even if he\u2019d barely finished his glass of champagne from so long ago. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the wolf admitted, his voice soft and \u2013 what was it? A little hopeful? \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before. If I\u2019m making you uncomfortable, we can stop.\u201d His light-coloured eyes trailed over Stiles\u2019 face, still burning with intensity. \u201cDo you want to stop?\u201d he asked, his voice low.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles found himself saying, his voice equally as soft, \u201cFor the life of me, I can\u2019t think of a reason to stop.\u201d Indeed, his own hand, resting against the dark fabric of the wolf\u2019s coat, clutched it a little tighter, the cloth heavy and costly beneath his fingers. Their dancing had slowed so gradually while they were lost in each other\u2019s eyes that movements were little more than a gentle sway.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Stiles faltered, his utterances lost to the jumble of his mind. \u201cI feel a little strange right now,\u201d he tried, slipping his hand from the stranger\u2019s grasp and settling it against the other\u2019s chest, firm beneath his touch. \u201cNot \u2013 not strange in a bad way, though. Just \u2013 peculiar. It feels as though my chest is being clutched in a vise.\u201d They\u2019d stopped moving altogether now, and the taller man\u2019s hand, now free of Stiles\u2019, came forward to clasp fingers gently beneath his jaw. Stiles felt caged, impossibly surrounded by the other, his senses full of nothing but the man\u2019s smell and sight, the feel of his hand against his back, pressing them level, and the thumb that skimmed the sensitive spot below his ear that made him shudder (of which he\u2019d never even <em>known</em> of before). He found his eyelids fluttering low as the tips of the fingers travelled over his cheek, curling under the edge of his mask and beginning to move it aside. His eyes were closed, now, his breathing a little heavier and lips parted as he felt the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 against his face move\u2026</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the loud chime of a grandfather clock rang out across the gardens, piercing and thunderous over the previously gentle harmonies of the music inside. Stiles\u2019 eyes shot open and his hand came up quickly, grabbing the wolf\u2019s wrist and halting his movement suddenly. It was far later than he\u2019d thought \u2013 midnight, by the sound of the gongs \u2013 and Scott had told him they\u2019d needed to leave by then. Already he was probably late to meet him outside to await the coach.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d he sputtered frantically, a panicked feel in his chest as he broke away from the man\u2019s embrace. \u201cI need to \u2013 I have to go.\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he turned and rushed away, darting through the garden and weaving through the throng of merrymakers. It was a miracle that, stepping outside, Scott was waving to him merrily, looking as though he\u2019d just arrived and dishevelled enough to assume that he\u2019d been pulled through a hedge backwards, if not for the lipstick smears across his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe said <em>yes</em>, Stiles!\u201d he crowed as they piled into the carriage, his grin so wide it was infectious. \u201cShe said <em>yes</em>. We\u2019re going to arrange for our parents to meet and formally draw up the papers! Allison and I are going to be <em>married</em>.\u201d He shoved him in the arm and flailed his hands in the air in front of him, the hound mask forgotten completely and hanging off the back of his head by its ribbons.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 Scott, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Stiles enthused, wrapping his arm around his best friend as they cheered happily, delighted in his comrade\u2019s good fortune. He steadfastly refused to put any thought into what had happened with the handsome stranger only moments ago, instead focusing on the good spirits of the moment. The ride certainly involved a lot of hugging and overjoyed declarations of life-long friendship.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until later that evening, after Scott had dropped him off at his house with a last giddy goodbye, that Stiles tiredly removed his suit and hung it onto his mannequin for the evening to wash and pack away in the morning. And it was only after he\u2019d removed every last stitch of the party clothes and slipped on his nightshirt that he realized, with surprise and a degree of annoyance, that one of his gloves was missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything, because I thought that maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, you\u2019d undergone some considerable mental recalibration and turned into an actual, successfully-functioning human being,\u201d Laura began, leaning against the back of his chair and looking over his shoulder, \u201cBut now I\u2019m having doubts, because surely this individual here cannot be my beloved brother, who detests nothing more than parties, who quoted them recently as being \u2018<em>just so ugh</em>\u2019.\u00a0 I say this because the party-hating brother I know wouldn\u2019t spend an entire afternoon sitting at his writing desk <em>writing out party invites</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a particular reason you\u2019re choosing to annoy me, Laura?\u201d Derek groused, hunched over the polished wood of the bureau and writing out names agonisingly slowly in the proper calligraphy his writing teacher had drilled into him, rather than his usual, near-unintelligible scribble. \u201cI thought perhaps taking Cora\u2019s advice to be more <em>fun</em> would be a wise course of action. After last week\u2019s event, she\u2019s practically been inundated with invites from eligible young men.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Derek, you don\u2019t <em>like</em> being social,\u201d his elder sister pointed out, and if it had been anyone else, the response would have been veritably insulting. But because it was Laura, and she knew him almost better than he knew himself, Derek couldn\u2019t help but feel it was the truth. \u201cSomething happened that made you change your mind on the whole \u2018social butterfly\u2019 aspect, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d he was quick to reply, because <em>curses</em>, but Laura knew him <em>too </em>well. His sister hummed noncommittally, but didn\u2019t move away from her bothersome perch against the back of his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced, Derek,\u201d she tutted, \u201cNot after I saw you come in from the garden \u2013 You looked like someone had repeatedly kicked you in the ribs, and you went straight upstairs to your room, even when Lord Hutchins greeted you and tried to draw you into conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like talking to Lord Hutchins,\u201d Derek justified, putting his pen down and turning to Laura.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>please</em>,\u201d she scoffed, \u201cYou <em>always</em> want to talk to Lord Hutchins. You and the old man have a deep, spiritual bond based on riding and proper horseshoe care. I\u2019ve seen the way you two prattle on and on and <em>on</em> about it. There has factually been no instance in recorded history in which you haven\u2019t spoken to him when you\u2019ve both been in the same room. Last time at Nancy\u2019s wedding you almost bowled over a member of the staff in your haste to get to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me, Cora was making fun of me for <em>weeks</em> after that,\u201d he moaned. \u201cAnd in my defence, the boy ran out of nowhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>point</em> is,\u201d Laura pressed on, grinning mischievously, \u201cIt looks like my little Der has found somebody. Now, who\u2019s the lucky girl? Or boy? Because I distinctly remember young Lord Tyrin looking at you with doe eyes at the fair last summer. Is it somebody we know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s nobody we know,\u201d he rolled his eyes, and then caught himself. \u201cI meant \u2013 it\u2019s not anybody \u2013 there wasn\u2019t \u2013 <em>damn it</em>, Laura!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I knew it!</em>\u201d she cackled in glee, clapping her hands. \u201cSo <em>that\u2019s </em>why you\u2019re writing invites, then? To invite them back? Why not just send an invite to him alone? Why bother to invite almost every noble in the country?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause \u2013 Laura, because I didn\u2019t get his name,\u201d he said dejectedly, picking at a loose thread of his shirtsleeve. \u201cHe left before I could ask, and I \u2013 honestly, I\u2019d never seen him before. I would have remembered someone like him, but I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know who it could possibly be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re hoping that, if you hold a party, he\u2019ll come again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the plan. At least, that\u2019s what I was hoping to do. I\u2019ve never hosted a party before, Laura, Mother always figures the details out. It\u2019s definitely a lot more difficult than I\u2019d been expecting it to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re scheduling this party for next week?\u201d Laura asked, incredulous, as she picked up one of the invites and scanned over the neat penmanship. \u201cDerek, Mother took <em>two months</em> to plan the previous one, and even then it was a rush. There\u2019s no way everything can be organized before then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>kidding</em> me,\u201d he groaned, tilting his head back and staring at the ceiling above him as though it had grievously wronged him. \u201cThis is \u2013 this is an absolute disaster. I just wanted to see him again, and I don\u2019t even \u2013 what if he wasn\u2019t from around here? I looked at the guest list from the party, more than twenty of the nobles had been accompanied by family from another region. What if he\u2019s not here anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll suppose you and I had better come up with another solution to find him,\u201d she acquiesced, rubbing his shoulders and pressing an affectionate kiss on top of his short, dark hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t any reason for Stiles to be feeling as morose as he was, especially considering the life-altering night he\u2019d had, the brilliant, dream-like evening that had opened his eyes to the glittering life of the upper crust nobility. And yet, he\u2019d found himself in such a sorry mood that he hadn't opened the store for two days running after that night, too preoccupied to the swirling thoughts inside his head to do anything more than idly tidy the house and shop, and stare listlessly into space.</p>\n<p>Of course, there was nothing that could be done. It had been a wonderful night, yes, but he had to face the unforgiving reality that the evening had been just that \u2013 a magnificent memory to be treasured. That was all it could be.</p>\n<p>The man in the wolf mask \u2013 he\u2019d been something Stiles hadn't counted on, something brilliant and shining in his world of dulled, faded colours. Amongst the dazzling, overstated extravagance, he had been something unpretentious and genuine, and that had made him all the more luminous to his eyes. Even days after, Stiles had been able to feel the warmth of his broad, bare hand against his own, the fiery touch that had travelled over his jawline that had made him shudder with unexpected pleasure. That magical night, something had come alive in him that he\u2019d never known to exist before, something small and lonely that had unfurled with warmth under the other man\u2019s captivating eyes, that had pounded against the walls of his heart, begging to be let out.</p>\n<p>But Stiles had to face the reality \u2013 he was a lowly tailor in a small town, nothing more, and the wolf-masked man was obviously a noble, a high-born at that. Their paths would have never crossed in another circumstance, not when nobles\u2019 clothes were usually made in the capital by high-name designers. And even if they did chance to meet, their lives were too far apart, their social positions too dissimilar. He had been carefully vague about himself when conversing in the gardens, and with good reason, too \u2013 the working-class were not meant to mingle with the nobles. That was the rule.</p>\n<p>So, with a heavy heart, Stiles did the only thing he knew how to do; he locked down tight the yearning, desperate part of him that longed for those strong hands and those jewel-tones eyes on him again, and drew the shutters open in his store. He had clothes to make, after all, and food to put on his table. No amount of daydreaming and wishing could put coins in his pockets or bread in his belly \u2013 he had to be realistic, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To say that Derek was passionate about finding the mystery youth he\u2019d danced with at the ball was putting it mildly \u2013 it was becoming a near fixation, spending hours scouring lineages in the family\u2019s library of nobles\u2019 family trees. None of them seemed to match what he was looking for, though \u2013 they were either people he knew, or didn\u2019t match the right age or gender. He\u2019d already checked most of the noble areas where he believed the youth would be, quickly learning that no one of his description was part of any social circle. The only one close to the young man in any way was young Lord McCall, but Derek had met him on a couple of occasions, and he\u2019d definitely not been the one. Moreover, there had been the recent news that he\u2019d not long ago proposed to young Lady Argent, so that ruled it out of the question with absolute sureness.</p>\n<p>He still had the glove that he\u2019d found that night, only moments after the fox-masked young man had left so abruptly. He\u2019d been left wordless and stunned, having realized that his dance partner had deserted him so hastily, before noticing the accessory lying on the ground. It must have come free of its purchase in the other\u2019s vest as they parted, going unnoticed in the other\u2019s rush to leave. He\u2019d retired to his room that night, clutching it tightly in his hand and foregoing the rest of the evening\u2019s festivities, feeling somewhat disorientated and mystified now that his fox had gone.</p>\n<p>Laura attempted to help him in his search, but the trail grew cold as snow quickly, and before he knew it, almost two weeks had passed after the fateful night. With his fruitless results, he grew more and more dejected, bitter and loath to hide his depressed and hurt heart. Despite the time that passed, Derek could recall with almost perfect clarity the few, precious moments he\u2019d shared with the other. Never before had he found himself taking so easily to a stranger \u2013 Laura, obviously, had grown up with him and was accustomed to his frank opinions and his atypical behaviours as a noble. That was probably why they\u2019d always gotten along as children, since Laura was as distinctive as he, intelligent and clever and unafraid to speak her mind. She and Cora were like chalk and cheese, and Derek would have never guessed, not in a thousand years, that Laura\u2019s sharp mind wouldn\u2019t be able to solve every problem. Indeed, it was Cora, of all people, who pulled him from the dead-end rut he\u2019d spiralled into.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, what a lovely glove!\u201d Cora remarked one day as she came from snooping in Derek\u2019s room, looking for some paper with which to return a letter. Derek, slumped in the drawing room and flicking through a novel with irritation, almost surged from his chair with annoyance and snatched it back. Sensing Cora\u2019s playful mood, however, and knowing how big a deal she would make of it, he kept his face neutral as his younger sister examined it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at all these lovely details!\u201d she remarked, and Derek noncommittally grunted in reply, keeping his eyes carefully on the pages in front of him. It wasn\u2019t as though he hadn't traced the delicate embroidered border of ivy leaves himself so many times he\u2019d practically memorized it, or considered how the size of the hand was smaller than his own, not overly so but just enough to fit perfectly into his, as it had the night of the dance. \u201cDerek, I didn\u2019t know you had such nice gloves. You should have told me, I\u2019d love a pair such as these for my walking dress. Where\u2019s the other one, though? Silly place to leave your gloves, on your writing table instead of in your drawers. Mother would have a fit if she knew you were leaving your things around. You really should consider a full-time valet, instead of only one when we have parties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fully capable of dressing myself, Cora,\u201d Derek answered evenly, flicking another page over, having absorbed exactly none of the words. It was a near-impossible feat, to remain so calm when every fibre of his being wanted to launch his body from his chair and snatch the precious item back, but he succeeded, somehow. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not my glove.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. <em>Oh</em>,\u201d she smirked mischievously, \u201cIs this a <em>favour </em>from someone, Derek? Did a special somebody leave you something behind to remember them by?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody left me anything,\u201d he sighed, as if impatient with her silly notions. Years of doing it must have honed his skills well, because his words came out sounding so blas\u00e9 that she actually huffed out in annoyance, her fun spoilt. Derek didn\u2019t feel too bad about lying, not when technically he was speaking the truth \u2013 the glove hadn't been left to him on purpose, anyway. He was of a mind to jump on his horse and scour the entire kingdom, every last house and establishment, in search of his fox.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to get something this pretty made for myself,\u201d she grumbled, tossing the fabric over to Derek, who caught it in his hand deftly. \u201cI wish I knew whose glove it was. I could ask them about their tailor, and get a pair made.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCora, you\u2019re <em>brilliant</em>,\u201d Derek suddenly exclaimed, rising from his chair so fast he almost toppled it over, grabbing her by the upper arms and planting a hard, affectionate kiss on her forehead. Unmindful of her surprised squawk, he hugged her \u2018round the shoulders and took off at a run, hoping his mother hadn't gone out for the day so he could ask to borrow her address book.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every single tailor that he\u2019d visited at the capital had told him what he\u2019d feared most \u2013 not only was the glove none of their work, but they didn\u2019t recognise the craftsmanship that went into it. They\u2019d each complimented the intricate, hand-embroidered leaves along the edge, and Derek would have thought that, visiting the best tailors in the kingdom that specifically <em>catered</em> to nobles, someone would have <em>known</em> the work.</p>\n<p>He had more luck when he returned to town. Of the two best tailors in town, they\u2019d both said the same thing \u2013 it looked an awful lot like Deaton\u2019s work, only finer. Deaton, it turned out, was a fine tailor himself, though retired for quite a number of years. Exhausted from his investigatory work, he finally managed to track down his only apprentice that had continued into the business \u2013 a man named Stilinski.</p>\n<p>Derek, at the end of his tether, had fully intended to storm into the shop, clutching the glove aloft. Determined to have some answers, even if it meant shaking them out of the tailor, he\u2019d made his way to the small store on the far edge of the town, in the middle-class quarter. He wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, considering that he\u2019d actually dressed down, so he was fairly confident that he wouldn\u2019t be stabbed for his wallet \u2013 not immediately, anyhow. Probably enough time to tie his horse off and quickly duck inside to ask about the commissioned accessory.</p>\n<p>He was across the way, about to dismount his charger, when a figure came out of the doorway with a broom and began sweeping the entryway. Derek froze, one of his feet still hanging aloft from the stirrups. There was no fancy suit to be found, and the apron he wore was tattered in some places and there were loose threads hanging here and there off him, but there was no mistaking the slant of those shoulders, or the cherrywood colour of his hair, even from that far away. Derek felt his breath catch tightly in his throat, knowing in the pit of his stomach that it was him, and scrambled back into his saddle properly, edging his horse away from the main road and watching the youth discreetly from around the corner of the building closest to him. Without the mask, the young man was mesmerizing \u2013 he couldn\u2019t see every minute detail from that distance, but he was immediately captivated by the rosy cheeks and sweet, turned-up nose.</p>\n<p>An elderly man greeted him warmly as he made his way to the door, and the youth welcomed him inside, his smile warm and dazzling as he held the door open. He felt somewhat unsettled, lurking in the shadows as they headed inside together, and then quickly moving close to the shop and peering in the window \u2013 he honestly felt like a skulking prowler. But there was a pressing need to confirm, to validate his theory. The way the tailor moved his hands so animatedly when talking to the customer, the way he pursed his lips \u2013 it was all exactly like the man in the fox mask he danced with that night.</p>\n<p>It appeared that Derek\u2019s search was over, and the mystery of the youth\u2019s identity was solved \u2013 he was the tailor, Stiles Stilinski. He would have to be blind and in denial to refuse to associate the richly-dressed fox with him. Stiles was the one he had been looking for all this time. His mouth dry and his chest tight, Derek turned his horse and made his way back to the manor, his mind working furiously. He didn\u2019t care that Stiles was a lowly member of the working-class \u2013 what he\u2019d shared with him at the party was extraordinary, something he\u2019d never experienced before in his life, and he wasn\u2019t about to let the ridiculous politics of class division to stand in the way of his emotions. His family had been on the lookout for someone he could marry, and he\u2019d never been keen on the idea before. But now, he\u2019s entirely supportive of the suggestion, as long as it\u2019s with the man he danced with at the ball.</p>\n<p>He just has to figure out how to approach the other without scaring him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One day, out of the blue, Stiles had a package delivered to his store. It had been almost three weeks since the ball, and he\u2019d almost finally, definitively managed to convince himself that his life would return to its repetitive, monotonous state. Compared to the glittering events of that night, his existence seemed to be all the more lacklustre, but he was glad to have the memory of that evening as a bright remembrance.</p>\n<p>When the parcel arrived, Stiles had to check with the deliveryman to ensure it was the correct address. Everything seemed to be in order, though \u2013 his name and address were written in neat script upon the waxed fabric over it. Whatever it was, the bundle had been quite heavy, and he\u2019d almost buckled under the surprising weight of it as he hefted it to his worktable. He\u2019d never received a parcel before in his life \u2013 it was with trepidation that he cut and unwound the string from the carefully wrapped muslin.</p>\n<p>There was a flat bolt of fabric inside, thickly-embroidered brocade that felt heavy and lush under his fingers. The stark white of the roses and vines against the brilliant gold underneath was luminous, and the cloth could have easily cost more than he made in the entire year.</p>\n<p>There must have been a mistake, and Stiles felt the tendrils of panic creeping quickly into his bones. From a corner of the textile, he noticed an odd corner of cream sticking out, and gingerly pulled at it, unveiling an envelope of thick parchment sealed with wax. Unable to contain his curiosity, he pried the seal off with a blunt fingernail and pulled out a note, folded in half. Opening that, his eyes widened at the coiling, elegant script across the page.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Esquire Stiles Stilinski,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Please find enclosed a token of appreciation, as, after seeing your creations, I have become a great aficionado of your handiwork.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>With regards,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>An Admirer</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stunned, and feeling his eyebrows climb so high they were certainly in danger of joining his hairline, he read the note again, and then a third time.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he murmured, and then he repeated himself, just for emphasis. \u201cOh my <em>god.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gifts continued to come, every two or three days, always different and unique. The second parcel held a box of buttons, gilded and raised with exquisite fleur-de-lis, while the third held a thick roll of lace so fine that he was sure it must have come from abroad, and was almost as costly as the cloth. Another bundle was long and ridiculously light for its size, and held bundles of feathers from exotic, tropical birds, richly coloured and more vibrant than anything he\u2019d ever seen. Each bequest was accompanied by the same letter written in the fine, curling writing, each from his admirer. Stiles would be lying to himself if he said that he wasn\u2019t beyond flattered by them, that he didn\u2019t keep the notes tucked away in his bureau drawer upstairs in his room and re-read them. He\u2019d never had an admirer before, nobody had even looked <em>twice</em> at him, and now \u2013 well, what was he supposed to do?</p>\n<p>He was given a silver box of hand-pressed sugar sweets, crafted into exquisitely ornate shapes that seemed almost criminal to consume, though he couldn\u2019t help but utter a delighted sigh as he tried one. A bottle of wine came next, dusty and of an old vintage, and though Stiles didn\u2019t drink red wine, he was sure that one day his tastes would change, and it would be a perfect indulgence for that day.</p>\n<p>In total, he received seven parcels in two weeks, and he was beginning to look forward to the new day, to the possibility of the well-suited courier who rapped on his front door and cheerily pushed the next gift into his hand. Knowing there was someone out there in the big, wide world, who valued his work enough to give him such expensive tokens \u2013 frankly, it made him feel giddy, but somehow a little heartsick at the same time. He couldn\u2019t forget the man he\u2019d danced with so joyously that fateful night, so long ago, of the perfect press of his hands against him. He spent many long, sleepless hours staring at the ceiling of his room in the dark, regretting his hasty flight from the gardens, dodging away from those elegant fingers that had, so perilously, held the edge of his mask. Many a night Stiles found him awaking from a fevered dream of those hands against him once more, of firm lips against the underside of his jaw, the knuckles of his hand. Each time he did, he was quick to remind himself that the night was done, and he would not cross paths with the masked man again.</p>\n<p>One final package came the morning after a particularly sleepless night, plagued by dreams of peridot-green eyes and a smooth-timbered voice. Stiles barely let his mind wander as the pulled out the envelope first, ignoring the still-wrapped item lying in the open folds of the muslin. It wouldn\u2019t do to think of impossible things, not when he looked forward to the small, handwritten letters that came with each delivery, personal little notes that made his entire day brighter. Gingerly, he unfolded the latest one, skimming over the writing. Startling, Stiles re-read it again, sure that he\u2019d interpreted it incorrectly. The words remained the same;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Esquire Stiles Stilinski,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I do hope that you enjoyed the deliveries \u2013 I certainly found much pleasure in choosing them for you. Enclosed is one final gift to you, with a humble request. I wish to see you, face to face, so I may speak to you of my intentions. If you are so inclined to respond, please meet me in the public gardens a little way past the path beside the bridge on Miller\u2019s Way, tomorrow evening at 6 o\u2019clock.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>With affections,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your Admirer, D.H.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dumbfounded, Stiles could only stare at the letter, now hanging limply in his hand, feeling his chest suddenly constrict. It had seemed all so lovely, having an admirer, but now they wanted to meet him? Was this truly happening? There was no doubt in his mind, though, that he would be meeting the mystery benefactor of these gifts, if only to thank them so. Placing the letter carefully flat onto the counter, he unfolded and slid the rest of the packaging off the gift, and found his heart suddenly leap into his chest.</p>\n<p>Inside the folds of the opened parcel, wrapped delicately in layers of tissue paper, lay the mask of the wolf.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps requesting Stiles to meet him was too soon, Derek thought as he paced in his chamber that evening. Possibly, he speculated miserably, turning another corner and very nearly wearing a hole in the floor, the whole idea was ludicrous. He\u2019d been so careful to keep his letters neutral, free of emotions. Laura had been an enormous help in picking out the gifts as well, he doubted he would have gotten anything half as appealing without her input. And she\u2019d assured him that they were impartial, safe gifts that were impersonal.</p>\n<p>That is, until he sent the sweets. And the wine. He hadn't been able to help himself \u2013 he remembered how elegantly Stiles\u2019 fingers had wrapped around the stem of the glass, how he\u2019d hovered near the tables of sweetmeats and fruits at the ball. He didn\u2019t know if Stiles drank wine or not, if he liked sweets or not, but he couldn\u2019t help buying them and sending them anyway. If he didn\u2019t like sugar, the box was always pretty enough to keep, anyway, and if the wine was unacceptable, well \u2013</p>\n<p>Exhausted from his worrying, Derek grunted in frustration and fell face-first into his mattress, uncaring that his shirt was getting wrinkled. Maybe requesting to meet him was too soon, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have sent his mask from the ball to him, or signed the last letter with his initials. They were due to meet in less than twelve hours\u2019 time, and Derek felt the slow tendrils of anxiety begin to curl in his stomach.</p>\n<p>He was afraid of rejection, that was certainly true. What if Stiles thought him to be a pompous nobleman, and wanted nothing more to do with him? What if he came, but had no interest in Derek whatsoever? Or, worst of all, what if he didn\u2019t show up at all?</p>\n<p>Groaning despondently, Derek set up for a long, sleepless night of worrying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Against all better judgement, Stiles found himself closing his store early and drawing a bath, internally fighting with his inner monologue as he scrubbed the day\u2019s labour from his skin. Since he\u2019d opened the parcel yesterday, his mind had not stopped working, so much that he\u2019d pricked his finger twice with a needle as he\u2019d basted the lining to a lapel, something he hadn't done in a long, long time. He was at war with himself over what decision he should make. On one hand, he was most certain that it was a noble whom he\u2019d danced with at the ball, and had discovered his common standing. Maybe he was planning to threaten him, blackmail him for something?</p>\n<p>But the man he remembered from the dance didn\u2019t seem to be as cold-hearted as that. And, really, if he <em>were</em> planning on blackmailing him, why would he bother sending him gifts?</p>\n<p>Despite all instincts telling him that meeting the noble was not a good idea, Stiles was driven by one need: the desire to see the man again, if only for a few moments. He couldn\u2019t lie to himself anymore \u2013 since that fateful night, he\u2019d been completely and utterly entranced by the other, spellbound by his presence and easy conversation. If he were being completely selfish, he would give up all of his expensive, costly gifts, if only to share one more moment with the other man.</p>\n<p>Only a little while before the appointed meeting time, and Stiles was standing in the little clearing, nervously holding the mask in his hands, wrapped neatly in its original muslin cloth. He felt on edge and self-conscious \u2013 even wearing some of his cleanest, least-worn clothes, he was still obviously a working-class man. Yet he held his head high \u2013 his mother and father had been working-class, and there was no shame to be had in that, none whatsoever. His heart was steeled for disappointment, all hope firmly tempered down. If he had no expectations, he couldn\u2019t possibly walk away disheartened.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou came,\u201d a voice spoke from behind him, and Stiles whirled, the mask clutched tightly against his chest like a shield. The wolf \u2013 well, not wolf anymore, but a man \u2013 was standing only feet away, hands unsure by his sides. He was dressed in simple but elegant clothes and boots, but the cut and fabric of his shirt and breeches marked him as a noble as clearly as a brand. Without the concealment of the mask, Stiles was certain that he had never met anybody in his life quite as beautiful, and doubted he ever would, coloured in dazzling oranges and golds of fading sunlight glittering through the canopy of the trees around them. \u201cYou came,\u201d the noble repeated, almost awestruck, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would have been rude of me not to,\u201d Stiles replied, hoping his voice wasn\u2019t as nervous-sounding as he felt. \u201cEspecially after those gifts you sent me.\u201d Immediately he regretted the words, because an expression of discomfiture marred the handsome features of the other\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to sound rude when I said that,\u201d he quickly expressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no need,\u201d the other responded in turn, just as hastily. \u201cIt was \u2013 after the ball at our house, you see, I wasn\u2019t sure of how I should approach you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour house,\u201d Stiles echoed back, feeling the dread pool in his stomach, his quick mind piecing together the initials of the letter to the face. \u201cYou\u2019re Derek Hale. Of the Hale family.\u201d And suddenly the situation seemed so much worse than before, because it wasn\u2019t simply a regular noble before him, but one of old, blue blood, of incomparable wealth and status, a family line that shouldn\u2019t even be seen <em>talking </em>to the lower classes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is my name, yes,\u201d the man \u2013 <em>Derek</em> \u2013 replied, stepping in closer, so they were hardly an arm-span away from one another. \u201cStiles \u2013 after the ball, I couldn\u2019t \u2013 it might sound tactless and forward, but since that evening, I haven\u2019t been able to think of anything but you.\u201d There was an expression of tenderness on his face, so poignant and intense that it almost made Stiles\u2019 head spin. \u201cI felt I was going mad, not knowing your name, who you were. I could think of little else but finding you again. Your glove \u2013\u201d he brought the missing accessory that Stiles had thought lost out from his jacket, holding it aloft, \u201cYou dropped this when you left. I searched all over the capital for its owner, thinking you were a noble, questioning every tailor I knew. I would have never thought you were a tailor yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt must have been an overwhelming disappointment when you found out,\u201d he murmured, his chest clenching with pain. \u201cI\u2019d known about the Hale parties for years, and had always wanted to attend at least once. I didn\u2019t \u2013 when I attended the ball with my friend, Lord McCall, I didn\u2019t \u2013 I hadn't meant any harm.\u201d His voice tapered off to something small and remorseful as a heated, shameful blush spread blotchily across his cheeks, feeling foolish that he\u2019d thought he could be present at such an event without causing a stir. \u201cI apologize \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have put you in such an awkward position.\u201d He held the fabric-covered mask between them, offering it to the other. \u201cHere \u2013 your mask, my Lord. I\u2019ve come to return it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is nothing for you to apologize for, <em>nothing,</em>\u201d Derek Hale effused, his expression serious. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to meet me here to express your remorse for the night, or to return my mask, Stiles. I requested to meet you here to tell you that, the night of the party, I was completely captivated by you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to stop,\u201d Stiles hissed, his emotions running rampant and prickling beneath his skin. \u201cYou cannot say such things to people of my class \u2013 it\u2019s improper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about propriety,\u201d Derek bit out, crowding into his space enough that Stiles was forced to step back, if only to put more distance between them \u2013 he couldn\u2019t remain so close to Derek, not if he was trying to keep his unseemly urges firmly lidded. \u201cWhat I care about is you \u2013 the way we were able to so easily make conversation, the comfort I felt around you. I\u2019d never felt something like that before, not in all my life. I \u2013 in that moment, just before you left, I truly felt as if we\u2019d made a connection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA connection might have been made, Lord Hale,\u201d he snapped back, as coldly as he could, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we should continue with it, see how far we could push the boundaries. That\u2019s dangerous territory for the both of us, and not something I\u2019m interested in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet you <em>came</em>,\u201d the noble shot back, his features wild for a moment, before smoothing back into a controlled fa\u00e7ade, \u201cBecause you know, as well as I, that we shared something exceptional. You wanted to see me again, just as much as I wanted to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t <em>matter</em> what I want!\u201d Stiles burst out, equal parts of anger and fear colouring his cheeks. \u201c<em>Nothing</em> I want matters, because it\u2019s not <em>my choice</em>! I\u2019m a mere tailor, and you\u2019re a noble! Tailors aren\u2019t worthy of nobles\u2019 love. And you shouldn\u2019t -\u201d his voice cracked slightly on the word, before he pushed on, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t settle for less.\u201d He pressed the muslin-wrapped mask against the older man\u2019s chest, erecting another barrier between them even as the other adamantly refused to take it into his hands. \u201cTake your mask back, and forget about that night, forget about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to forget,\u201d Derek returned, his voice carefully controlled, even as his eyes bore into Stiles\u2019. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you again, not now that I\u2019ve finally found you. You felt it too, and you still feel it now, this connection between us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you have sorely misjudged my ability to care,\u201d Stiles lied through his teeth, eyes shuttering, before glancing away quickly, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t. I can easily go home and forget all about you. And you, Derek Hale, should do the right thing for both of us and do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ignoring the wounded expression on the noble\u2019s face, Stiles spun on his heel and walked away, his pace brisk and spine rigid. Derek reached out and took his arm, as if to stop him, but he abruptly shook the hand off and continued on his way. He paid no attention to the shouts of his name that followed him from the clearing. He didn\u2019t change his pace until he\u2019d reached his little shop and bolted the doors behind him, the house swathed in the darkness of early evening.</p>\n<p>His face was impassive and stony, nose stuffy and face burning as if he\u2019d gotten dust against it, and, after lighting a lamp, he stepped brusquely to his worktable with the intention of clearing away the little clutter still upon it. Belatedly, he realized that he was still holding onto the wrapped wolf mask. Uttering a frustrated noise, he shoved the offending item under the desk and out of sight, behind a pile of scrap calico, and tersely rearranged his work-tools with a brutal efficiency. He didn\u2019t realize his vision was wavering until he blinked, and a tear fell upon the back of his bare hand, gripping a tracing wheel so tightly his knuckles turned a sickly white. Letting out a pained gasp, Stiles bit back a sob, scrubbed at his eyes quickly, and took a deep shaking breath, before forcing himself to clean and forget all about what had occurred in the clearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The words were sharp and biting, and, to a lesser man, would have cowed them. Stiles was behind his work desk, a disapproving frown across his lips and his brows furrowed in condemnation. His stance was radiating displeasure as he stood, arms akimbo and stray bits of thread stuck in the scruff of his hair, obviously trying for intimidating, perhaps a touch menacing. Derek simply thought he seemed terribly endearing, and he closed the door of the workshop quietly behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were lying, yesterday evening,\u201d he ventured, stepping forward and leaning a hip casually against the edge of the worn table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles replied curtly, his argument betrayed by the blotchy flush of his cheeks as he hastily turned away. Derek folded his arms over his chest and raised an eyebrow, the excuse not washing with him one bit \u2013 but then again, he had grown up with Cora, and her penchant for telling tall tales, especially for getting him in trouble with their parents. Stiles ducked down under the counter quickly, straightening with something in his hand that he pushed across the desk, wrapped in fabric. Derek recognised it as the mask from the evening prior, when Stiles had tried to push it back into his hands. He was surprised the younger man hadn't thrown it away.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt matters, you know,\u201d he said softly, ignoring the muslin package. When Stiles quirked an eyebrow at him in confusion, pose mirrored with his own arms folded before him, Derek raised his eyes to meet the other\u2019s own amber ones. \u201cWhat you said before. That what you want doesn\u2019t matter. Because it does. It should.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot many of us have the freedom to make that choice, my Lord,\u201d Stiles sniped, his voice oozing sarcasm. Derek refused to be provoked by the tone, instead peering over Stiles\u2019 shoulder as the tailor turned back to his work, pointedly ignoring him. Undeterred, Derek dragged over one of the high stools from the other end of the counter and sat opposite the workbench, elbows on the table and watching intently as Stiles traced up a line of tailor\u2019s chalk on the fabric, the white stripe a stark contrast to the darker material under his slim, elegant fingers. Stiles\u2019 eyes flicked over to him, then stubbornly back to his task, the obstinate set of his shoulders and thin line of his lips showing just how ill at ease he felt.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to leave? Or continue sitting there for the rest of the day and drive my customers away?\u201d he finally snapped, the silence between them proving too much. Derek, dressed in simple, unobtrusive shirtsleeves and riding breeches, merely rested his chin atop of his hand in reply, resisting the urge to gesture at the empty store. Stiles rolled his eyes dramatically and sighed through his nose, taking a pair of shears in hand and snipping the selvage edge off.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust keep your hands off my work, and try not to distract me too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles hadn't expected Derek Hale, a noble of all things, to be quite as persistent as he was, but he was proved wrong. The sheer perseverance of the other man was almost mind-boggling, considering he\u2019d not expected anybody to be as tenacious about doing almost nothing all day, every day. Then again, he wasn\u2019t well versed in what nobles <em>did </em>on a daily basis anyway, so it wasn\u2019t as if he had a base for comparison on how they wished to spend their free time.</p>\n<p>Scott had only visited him twice after the ball, but Stiles couldn\u2019t blame him. He and young Lady Argent had only just gotten engaged, and he\u2019d be neck-deep in social outings events that left no room for anything else. With a family to formally meet, gatherings to be seen at together and a marriage contract to sign, Stiles counted himself lucky that he\u2019d been able to see Scott at all, and braced for a long, lonely stretch of time without seeing his friend.</p>\n<p>Derek Hale came to his shop almost every day, an hour or two after he\u2019d opened up shop, and sat at the stool on the other side of the counter, away from his work desk. Every day he arrived, he came dressed in clothes simple enough to not outright declare him of noble blood, and watched Stiles with an ardent curiosity as he worked, asking the occasional question or making small talk as he measured and cut, pinned and stitched. Each time, Stiles slid over the parcel containing the wolf mask, expecting the noble to get the hint and take the offending item back. And, at the end of each day, Derek Hale left his shop, somehow pleased with the course of the day\u2019s events (despite Stiles being preternaturally silent) and leaving the linen-wrapped package on the countertop, unmoved.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Stiles stopped bringing it out from under the desk. He let his mind believe that there was no point in doing so \u2013 not if the other man refused to take it back, let alone acknowledge its existence. And so, it remained tucked behind the calico scraps and boxes of spare spools of thread and packets of needles.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t seem to understand this particular brand of pestering, especially when Derek was reticent and restrained at the best of times. But his eyes were still that startlingly clear green-grey hue, warm and inviting, and the few times that Stiles found he was answering a question found Derek\u2019s lips pulling upwards into a radiant, delighted smile, transforming his entire face. And, perhaps, Stiles felt his insides flutter when Derek <em>did</em> smile, and tried, as hard as he could, not to count those times as small, personal victories.</p>\n<p>The trouble was \u2013 well, there were many things wrong with their situation. Derek was a noble, and of good lineage, while Stiles was common-born, due to inherit nothing save for a lifetime of repetitive work, maybe an apprentice or two in his future to carry on his business name. And, after so many years of the same monotonous existence, with no family and fewer friends than he\u2019d hoped for, Stiles had become nothing more than a bitter young man who could, on occasion, make beautiful clothes fit for actual nobles. Most times, however, he was reduced to making simple garb for the working man, making his complete existence lacklustre and mind-numbingly dreary.</p>\n<p>Day after day passed in the same manner, with Derek hovering across the table, pigheadedly refusing to budge, and Stiles caught himself appreciating the company. He hadn't realized just how solitary his day could be without the customers coming in constantly \u2013 it was an off-time, an awkward period between Spring and Summer, where his business dropped enough that he could work on more time-consuming commissions without people barging in and out of the store. What few customers did enter somehow managed to rope Derek into conversation, even if it was somehow a little brief and stilted on both sides, until Stiles managed to write down order slips and receipts in a quick hand to get them out of his shop.</p>\n<p>Stiles found that he was, unthinkingly, slipping the fa\u00e7ade of carefully controlled distance and coolness that he\u2019d built up against the other man. He hadn't think he\u2019d warm up to someone so fast, but the earnest, sincere questions and looks that Derek sent his way made his restraint slip. More and more, he realized his mouth had been running away from him, chatting openly and joking along with Derek as he worked. Sometimes he even found his words taking on a tone that could be interpreted as flirtatious. He was always quick to pull back and resume his dispassionate demeanour, but it was becoming more difficult as the days passed. Especially when Derek\u2019s stool, over time, edged closer to his work area, and Stiles didn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>The wolf mask, so haphazardly pushed below the counter, found its way upstairs to Stiles\u2019 room. The muslin wrapping was gone, thrown back into the scraps box, and the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 disguise propped up against his low bookshelf. Some evenings, alone in his room with nobody for company save one of his books, Stiles found his fingers tracing along the ridges of the beast\u2019s face, recalling the tinkling music of the ball and the large, warm hands against his back, against his bare palm. Those evenings were always the most difficult to go through, because his loneliness felt palpable and near-suffocating, and he couldn\u2019t get out of his head for hours, endlessly stuck in a loop of fond memories that he had no right owning, and no right wishing for again.</p>\n<p>The days that Derek didn\u2019t come to the shop were the worst. Because, inexplicably, Stiles had come to look forward to his visits, to their growing chatter and conversations. Derek never treated him as a lesser being because his blood wasn\u2019t blue \u2013 he regarded him just as Scott did, as an equal. And, against all defences and resistances, Stiles\u2019 affections grew stronger with each passing day, his veneer of indifference and coldness crumbling with each soft word, each cautious smile. The days that Derek didn\u2019t occupy the stool (<em>his</em> stool, Stiles now considered) truly were the most unpleasant, because despite trying desperately not to give in to his emotions, he was becoming used to Derek being by his side, and that only seemed to emphasize his loneliness when he wasn\u2019t around.</p>\n<p>Of course, word spread of Lord Hale\u2019s presence in his shop, as was inclined to do in a town where nothing seemed more highly regarded than local gossip.</p>\n<p>It started slowly, at first, so subtle and unremarkable that Stiles didn\u2019t notice for a long, long time. At first, it was glances from strangers on the streets, drawn-out looks that lingered for a moment or two longer than necessary. Stiles didn\u2019t take it much to heart, because he was known to step out of the store in various states of dishevelment. And, as such, Stiles usually brushed off whatever curious glances he received with his usual aplomb. It was only when the stares were accompanied with hushed whispers, not so discreetly hidden behind a raised hand. It wasn\u2019t bothersome, not at first, but Stiles could hardly walk down a street to buy a loaf of bread, or a new packet of thread, without garnering at least one gawp from a passer-by.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are beginning to talk,\u201d he offered inattentively, loosely basting down a lapel as Derek sat beside him at the worktable now. He was making himself useful by sorting his mess of buttons into organized containers, and Stiles almost startled at how close he\u2019d managed to sit, how over time he\u2019d moved his stool slowly enough for him not to notice. He felt it to be almost clever.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Derek replied offhandedly, scooping the small piles of horn, wood and wool into their respective containers. His workspace cleared, he upended another box of fastens and began sorting the pricier, fancier ones, the pearl, silk and ceramic buttons appearing dainty beneath his broad fingers. \u201cThey already think most of the Hale family are eccentric beyond words. It\u2019s not as if my reputation matters to me, after all \u2013 who are those people to judge me for what I want to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0His eyes lifted from his word, settling on Stiles\u2019, and the two shared a long, silent look. \u201cDo you \u2013care that I\u2019m here?\u201d he asked, his brows furrowing somewhat, concern etched on his handsome features. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to presume. If others are talking, and it\u2019s bothering you - -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles answered quickly, keeping his eyes to the work between his hands, as he felt his face grow warm. It was the best he could say at the time, even as his treacherous mind supplied him with a multitude of thoughts he could say \u2013 that Derek\u2019s presence alone seemed to make his entire day worthwhile, that, for once in his life, he could wake up in the morning and not dread the dull repetitiousness of his every day. Stiles didn\u2019t <em>have</em> a reputation to uphold \u2013 after all, he was a nobody, a small-town tailor that could have just as easily been overlooked in a crowd. It was Derek\u2019s repute he was worried about, but he knew, from the stubborn set of the other\u2019s jaw, that no amount of insisting would make him move off the stool and stay out of his store, out of his life. And a very selfish part of him, one that still remained in that glittering garden so many evenings ago, didn\u2019t care about the consequences to come, if only Derek stayed by his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he repeated, chancing a half smile at Derek, who returned it with a dazzling one of his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo <em>this </em>is where you\u2019ve been keeping yourself all this time, Derek,\u201d Laura\u2019s admonishing tone came imperiously from the doorway, and Derek visibly flinched, shooting her a panicked look. It had been such a good day, too \u2013 Stiles had been in one of his good moods, actively involving him in conversation as he worked and making almost flirtatious jokes with him, accompanied by his small, private smiles. And then, of course, Laura had to burst through the door and ruin <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d Stiles asked inquisitively from his work desk, wiping stray threads off his apron. For a moment, Derek\u2019s heart caught in his throat as his eldest sister rounded on Stiles, worried that he might soon have to break up a fight. But Laura\u2019s face suddenly took on an inscrutable emotion, and she quickly turned to the younger man with an affectionate look across her pretty features.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re <em>Stiles</em>. How silly of me. Do forgive me, I must take-\u201d she reached across and yanked on Derek\u2019s sleeve, hard enough to topple him from the stood and land awkwardly on his feet to avoid sprawling on the ground, \u201c-my wonderful brother home for a chat. It was wonderful to meet you in person, Stiles, I hope to see you again soon.\u201d And, flashing one of her usually delightful smiles, she heaved Derek out the door, her tiny frame belying the sheer force of her will. Derek had hardly a moment to look over his shoulder at the stunned face of the other and wave before Laura shut the door, gently but firmly, and dragged him around the corner of the building, where her horse was tied beside Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I know why you\u2019ve been quieter and even more enigmatic than usual,\u201d she mumbled <em>sotto voce</em>, \u201cHere I am, out of my <em>mind</em> with worry and thinking you might be doing something stupid like visiting gambling houses, or liquor dens, or, heaven forbid, a <em>house of ill-repute.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHouses of- Laura, what do you take me for?\u201d Derek sputtered, trying his outright best to sound indignant, even as his face flushed with embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How was I supposed to know</em>?\u201d she hissed, gesticulating enough that her dainty riding hat tipped off the pinned-up curls of her dark hair. Derek was exceedingly thankful that she preferred to wear her hair more naturally, because if she sported the silly <em>poufs</em> or <em>fontanges</em> that seemed to be the fashion, because he wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep a straight face and take her seriously. Laura must have sensed his mind wandering, because she was quick to slap him sharply on the arm to bring his focus back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point is \u2013 Derek, I\u2019ve been hearing rumours circulating that you\u2019ve been fraternising with the lower-class servants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles is <em>not</em> a servant, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d Derek snapped back hotly, helping Laura into her side-saddle, before untying both their horses and mounting on his own. \u201cHe\u2019s a tailor, and a damned fine one at that. And even if he <em>were</em> a servant, it has nothing to do with anyone but ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes he feel the same way?\u201d Laura asked, all the heat gone from her voice, her eyes soft-looking and worried as they steered their mounts away from the street. And, as if by magic, those six simple words had all the air deflate from his lungs. In all actuality, Derek had been avoiding thinking about the possibility of Stiles not returning his feelings, because it seemed too painful a concept. He\u2019d been so sure, from the way they\u2019d spoken at the party, and the telling argument that he\u2019d made so long ago in the clearing, that Stiles, too, felt what he did. Now that it had been voiced, however, he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2013 I think he might, but I don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he murmured, eyes affixed to the road before them. \u201cThe way we talk \u2013 how he smiles at me more freely now, I thought that, perhaps, we were getting closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the status difference doesn\u2019t mean anything to you?\u201d his sister asked, as they turned off the cobbled streets and made their way down the grassy path of the vale, towards the Hale manor.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a bit,\u201d he answered immediately, finding the honesty of the answer completely satisfying. \u201cI would care for him whatever class, rank or division he was. I would care for him even if I were struck blind, deaf, or mute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018<em>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind\u2019.</em>\u201d Laura recited, her lips curved upwards in a pleased smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad, at least, that you\u2019ve found yourself someone like that, Derek. Mother and Father will be so pleased to hear that you\u2019ve fallen in love, instead of having something arranged \u2013 they never could stand the idea of that. Seeing him today, and knowing what you\u2019ve told me about him, he\u2019s \u2013 different. From your other suitors, I mean. More himself, less eager to please at the cost of pretending to be something he\u2019s not. Regardless, he seems to care for you too, in his way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe status difference is affecting him more than he\u2019d care to admit,\u201d Derek muttered, feeling put out. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that, given time, he\u2019ll come to see my affections as sincere, not as a passing fancy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose that, at the end of the day, the fallout from this will die down, too. I can\u2019t possibly imagine what Stiles had to deal with, considering young Lord Birtrand and his fit earlier this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had wondered who it might have been that captured young Lord Hale\u2019s attention so thoroughly,\u201d came the smooth, charming voice from the front of Stiles\u2019 shop. Stiles was already in a bad mood \u2013 Derek had left so early the day before, and it was well past noon \u2013 far later than the usual time he\u2019d arrive, meaning that Stiles was facing a day without his company.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d he asked, his lips already pulled into a frown as he turned towards the source of the words. A woman in an expensive silk gown rustled forward, with pinned curls of honey-gold piled in an elaborate pouf atop of her head and an incredibly insincere smile across her beautiful face, all of which raised Stiles\u2019 hackles by default. Derek\u2019s name had been mentioned, and, judging by how other people before her had all begun their conversation in the same way, it wasn\u2019t going to be pleasant.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to see what kind of person would charm that cantankerous young noble so,\u201d the woman spoke, folding her hands prettily against the edge of the scrubbed wooden counter. From this close, Stiles could see the cold ruthlessness of her smile, the sharp dagger of her cold eyes, and felt chills down his back. \u201cI needed to see for my own eyes what was so great about them that a man with such pedigree would stoop so low to have. I have my sources, you see, and they\u2019ve been telling me just how much time Derek spends at your,\u201d she cast her eyes around the workshop, lip curled back in distaste, \u201c- quaint little hovel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is it, I suppose,\u201d Stiles replied with false cheer, extending his hands and gesturing to himself. \u201cWhat you see is what you get. And, yet, I assure you there\u2019s no magic spell at work. Just simple, plain old me, which, for some peculiar reason Lord Hale seems fond of annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think this could work out, don\u2019t you?\u201d the woman hissed, and it would have been intimidating, had Stiles not already dealt with four of Derek\u2019s other suitors in the past week, each threatening him with a form of bodily harm and to have him shackled in a prison cell for the rest of his days.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said nothing of the sort, really,\u201d Stiles replied calmly, picking up one of his ratty old pincushions and pushing his scattered pins into it. There was something to be said for pincushions and alleviating built-up anger. \u201cWhat Derek decides to do, or not do, is entirely out of my hands. If he wants to spend his day wasting time by bothering me while I work, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s decision but his.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see what you are, really,\u201d the woman \u2013 Lady Argent, he distantly remembered Scott pointing her out as Allison\u2019s aunt once \u2013 smirked. \u201cYou\u2019ve discovered what a pretty face you have, and so you\u2019re currying favour with the nobles, trying to give yourself a leg up, is that it? I must say, if I had to live in a fleapit such as this, I\u2019d use whatever means I had at my disposal to get somewhere less<em> infested</em>.\u201d Stiles tried, goodness knows he <em>tried</em> not to blush with mortification at her gaze raking up and down his body, but obviously he must have failed, because her grin got that little bit sharper, a little crueller. \u201cBut mark my words, boy,\u201d she continued, leaning forward enough to feel even more menacing than before, even with a table between them, \u201cNobles and commoners don\u2019t mix. Sure, Derek might have a little fun with you now and then, but like marry like, and you\u2019d be thrown out on the street the moment your usefulness has run its course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek is a gentleman, <em>my lady</em>,\u201d Stiles sneered, his shoulders squaring. \u201cNothing has occurred in this place that could be considered untoward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever the case might be, you need to understand that it\u2019s not your place to be associated with anybody of a higher standing than yourself. Keep to your own, boy, and I might not have to get the city guard onto you for indecent behaviour. I\u2019m sure a face as comely as yours won\u2019t do well in the barracks.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was out of the building before he could formulate an answer, and, thoroughly shaken, Stiles turned the sign to signify his shop\u2019s closure for the day and locked the door tightly. Struggling to take in a proper lungful of air, he slid to the floor with his back against the door and hugged his knees tightly, counting the inhalations in his head and forcing himself to breathe slowly, even with his body\u2019s need to take in great, sucking lungfuls.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t go on much longer this way, that much he knew. Derek \u2013 somehow, since the night of the ball, something remarkable had happened between them to draw each other closer, like the pull of a magic spell. Shy at first, they\u2019d become increasingly closer, and Derek \u2013 he\u2019d slowly become so dear and precious to Stiles. In a night so full of glittering treasures, in a gorgeous world he had no right to be a part of, Stiles had felt small, still and obscured. But Derek had found him, had sought him out, and now \u2013 now, there was nothing Stiles could do to convince himself that he wasn\u2019t in love with him.</p>\n<p>Deep down, buried far beneath the rising tide of selfishness that wanted to keep Derek all to himself, he knew that a situation such as this could not work. He\u2019d taken up far too much of Derek\u2019s time as it was, indulging his longing for his company, for those rare, joyous smiles he gave him. In the past, he\u2019d tried desperately to make Derek understand, regardless of his insistence, that their futures were not meant to be together. Derek would marry noble blood, and raise a family of fine children to carry on the name, while Stiles \u2013 if Stiles was lucky, perhaps, he too might find someone to love one day.</p>\n<p>It was a form of torture, not accepting Derek\u2019s affections, despite every fibre of his being wanting to, desperately yearning for it. But for both of their sakes, it was something that had to be done.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek hadn't visited Stiles\u2019 shop for three days running, four if he included that afternoon where Laura had unceremoniously dragged him out of the store. His days had been hectic and eventful, considering what he\u2019d had to go through with Laura to tell his parents about his choice to be with Stiles. The situation had been exhausting, especially in trying to get his affairs in order. Surprisingly enough, his parents had been only slightly hesitant to give their blessings when he\u2019d mentioned Stiles\u2019 rank, but in the end, they\u2019d had no choice in the matter. Their own marriage had been built out of love, and there was no denying Derek\u2019s affections for the tailor were genuine.</p>\n<p>The moment he stepped into Stiles\u2019 workshop, he knew something was wrong. Stiles, usually so hard at work already, was leaning against his worktable with his arms, his face drawn into an expression of unhappiness. And while that alone might have made his chest clench, it was the way that Stiles\u2019 eyes lifted to him and lingered, clear and wide and forlorn, that made his breath halt completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should come around here anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those words had the same effect as that time Ginger, his childhood pony, accidentally kicked him in the stomach and laid him up in bed for three days straight. Except, somehow, this made him feel a lot worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d he asked immediately, his mind already running through a list of all the possible circumstances that would have brought a frown to Stiles\u2019 face. One possibility after another crossed his mind, from financial troubles to personal problems, before he finally processed the words properly \u2013 Stiles didn\u2019t want <em>him</em> coming around anymore. His body went cold at the thought. \u201cSomeone\u2019s said something, haven\u2019t they?\u201d he stepped forward, closing the distance between them. Laura had told him about some of the nobles coming to Stiles, poisoning his mind with lies \u2013 the same nobles that had tried to curry favour with him, to woo him as marriage prospect. \u201cHas somebody threatened you? Tell me who they were \u2013 I won\u2019t stand for you being harassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just not <em>listening </em>to me!\u201d Stiles shouted, thumping his fist against the flat surface of his desk in frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t want you here! You don\u2019t <em>belong </em>here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you saying this now? What\u2019s changed?\u201d Derek cried, confused and hurt, stepping forward again until there were barely a couple of paces apart. He\u2019d thought they\u2019d been getting closer, becoming something more than friends, slowly but surely. Stiles had smiled at him more, talked to him more openly. Just the other day, their hands had brushed against the table, reaching for the same thing, and Stiles hadn't jerked away immediately. Before, he\u2019d have given anything for Stiles to be looking at him so intently, but the way he was now, it felt like finality, like a goodbye. \u201cStiles \u2013 why are you telling me this now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and I were never supposed to meet,\u201d Stiles sighed wearily, running a long-fingered hand through his hair, making it stick up oddly. \u201cWe were supposed to live our lives apart. We still are. But every day, you come into my shop and sit at your stool, and you talk to me and make me feel like \u2013 this isn\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re not supposed to be here, with me, Derek. You\u2019re supposed to marry a beautiful, rich noble and have your children and live in your big, expensive manor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m supposed to do doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Derek entreated, closing the distance between them completely and taking one of Stiles\u2019 hands between his. It was the first time he\u2019d initiated contact since their first encounter in his garden, and the mere touch sent a thrilling, warm bloom up his entire arm. \u201cStiles, you\u2019re all that matters to me. Each and every day, you\u2019re all I think about. Why do you want me to leave so badly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you here,\u201d Stiles murmured, his eyes downcast, sending what felt like a cinderblock into the pit of Derek\u2019s stomach. As if from afar, he watched the way Stiles seemed to shrink in on himself, the smooth column of his pale throat as he swallowed heavily, exhaling with a shaking breath. \u201cYou need to leave, and not come back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taking a deep inhalation of his own, Derek didn\u2019t move for a long moment. His eyes raked over Stiles\u2019 downturned face, desperate for a sign that it was false. But Stiles\u2019 expression was closed off, betraying nothing but remorse, and it made the situation all that more painful for him. After what felt like an eternity, he nodded once, tersely, and stepped back, releasing Stiles\u2019 hand, his expression detached and impassive.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said finally, hearing the tone of his voice coming across as cold, dispassionate, making Stiles flinch. \u201cIf you want me to leave, then I will. I\u2019ll respect your wishes; I\u2019ll go, and I won\u2019t come back.\u201d Ducking his head, feeling lost, Derek turned and stepped away, his footfalls echoing and loud in the silence of the shop. He paused a moment, almost at the door, and turned around to catch a glimpse of Stiles, one last time, before he left, even as his mind told him it was a foolish, weak thing to do \u2013 he\u2019d always been a foolish, weak man at heart, after all. \u201cI only wish,\u201d he spoke, regret colouring his words and unable to hold the sentiment back, \u201cThat I could have stopped myself from falling so deeply in love with you, if I had known you wouldn\u2019t feel the same in return.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not daring to look at Stiles again, for fear he wouldn\u2019t be able to tear himself away from this place, Derek turned and left, shutting the door quietly behind him. He didn\u2019t leave immediately, despite all common sense telling him it was the right thing to do. Instead, he leaned his back against the sturdy panelling of the door and exhaled, standing stock-still for a minute or two, willing his composure back in place.</p>\n<p>Which is how he was able to hear the quiet, broken sob from inside.</p>\n<p>Lost to all other senses except the need to be right beside Stiles in that very moment, Derek wrenched the door open and stepped back inside quickly. Stiles was standing at his bench still, a stricken look on his face and the tracks of tears still wet upon his cheeks. He mustn\u2019t have expected Derek to be there, and he was quick to scrub his palms against his face to erase the evidence, but Derek had seen enough to know. It was enough to break him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you act as if you didn\u2019t care?\u201d he demanded, striding forwards, feeling incensed and exasperated and distraught all at once. \u201cWhy do you reject me, time and time again? You know my feelings for you are true, and I can see it in your eyes that you share my affections.\u201d He reached out, holding Stiles by the arms, not sufficiently tight to hurt but firm enough that he couldn\u2019t get away, not again. \u201cDon\u2019t you see how much I care about you? Why won\u2019t you let yourself feel the same?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I <em>can\u2019t</em>!\u201d Stiles cried, the words wrenched from him, struggling to keep the tears from falling even as his voice broke with unshed emotion. \u201cI <em>can\u2019t</em>. I\u2019m not good enough! I\u2019m just a tailor! I was born into a low class to ordinary people. I can\u2019t \u2013 I will never be good enough for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>care</em> if anybody thinks you\u2019re not good enough!\u201d Derek roared, \u201cYou\u2019re good enough for me! You\u2019re all that I want! And if anybody has issues with whom I love, they\u2019ll have to speak to my entire family, because they know about it now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told them,\u201d Stiles choked out, a disbelieving laugh making his words sound even more choked than before. His hands rose and perched against Derek\u2019s chest, as if to push him away, but instead they simply rested against the fabric of his shirt. All of Derek\u2019s rage seemed to dissipate in that moment, and he let out a soft exhale, lips curled up in a small, amused smile, even as his heart was still clenched in knots.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Derek begged, cupping Stiles\u2019 face and wiping the tracks of his tears away with a thumb, \u201cI\u2019ve never been one for pleading, Stiles, but I beg of you \u2013 give this a chance. Give us an opportunity to be together.\u201d Even now, Stiles was as breathtaking as the first time he\u2019d set eyes on him, despite his face being blotchy and tear-stained. His eyelashes, wet from the tears, clumped together into long, angelic curls, and the colour was high on his cheeks. He was terrifyingly beautiful, both inside and out. \u201cI swear that I would spend the rest of my days making you happy, making you want for nothing. I would love you eternally, entirely, if you just said yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I have much choice in the matter, do I?\u201d Stiles replied, sounding desperately fond through his sniffles as he nuzzled into Derek\u2019s palm, sending tingles throughout Derek\u2019s entire being. \u201cNot unless I want to spend the rest of my life wallowing in regret, not being with the man I fell in love with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek was frightfully glad the shop was bereft of customers and the door latched behind him, because he couldn\u2019t contain the jubilant laughter that erupted from him, or the crushing need to heft Stiles into his arms and hold him nearer than ever before. He felt Stiles\u2019 hands grasp desperately at the back of his shirt, pressing them even closer, and knew for certain that, whatever hardships might come their way because of this, it would be more than worth it to have all of Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">. o O o .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>EPILOGUE \u2013 SIX MONTHS LATER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was awoken by gentle fingers trailing through his hair, and the softest press of lips against his bare shoulder. Mumbling incoherently for a few moments, Stiles shuffled in the soft comfort of the bed, the exquisite sheets like heaven against his skin as he creaked his eyes open, simultaneously searching for the source of the touch, while at the same time wanting to shut his eyes against the pale morning light seeping through the curtains and drift back into the restful embrace of sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning, sleepy-head,\u201d Derek\u2019s amused, soft voice murmured by his ear, and Stiles exhaled happily, twisting over to curl himself around the figure sitting on the edge of the mattress, dipping the feather-stuffed mattress down on one side.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Stiles smiled sleepily, catching one of Derek\u2019s hands in his own and tangling their fingers together with only minimal fumbling. Derek smiled in return, bringing their hands up to kiss along Stiles\u2019 knuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you breakfast,\u201d he stated, almost crowing with pride as he nodded to the silver platter of food on the bedside stand, the delicious, warm aromas from the plates already making Stiles\u2019 mouth water.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean you woke up early and harassed Gloria for the tray,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cDerek, you do realize that she\u2019s getting grumpy because you\u2019re stealing one of her jobs away from her, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I like to bring you breakfast while you\u2019re sleeping sometimes,\u201d Derek retorted with a grin, kissing the inside of Stiles\u2019 wrist and eliciting a delicious little shiver from it. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not the one who continues trying to make our bed in the mornings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGloria keeps telling me off about it,\u201d Stiles groaned, twisting downwards into the sheets. \u201cIt\u2019s still hard to get used to it, you know? Even if we\u2019ve been here two months, I still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m living with you. In a <em>manor</em>, of all places.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hardly a manor when it\u2019s a third the size of my family\u2019s house, and has only four staff,\u201d Derek deadpanned.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has a <em>stable</em>, and <em>kitchens</em>, and there are eight rooms and a <em>dining hall</em>, Derek, please excuse me if it takes me a little while to adjust.\u201d His pout didn\u2019t last long, not when Derek was bending down to nuzzle against his cheek, his scruff tickling him. \u201cSpeaking of which, we spent all day fixing the doors and partitions of the stables, I\u2019m <em>tired</em>. It\u2019s still too early to be out of bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLaura\u2019s coming over later for tea, along with Cora.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank you so much for reminding me, like I didn\u2019t know that Cora was harassing me without pause for those new gloves I\u2019m embroidering,\u201d Stiles grouched. \u201cI swear, she wholly and utterly <em>despised</em> me until she found out I was the one who made those gloves, and even now she barely tolerates me, unless she asks me to sew her something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could just say no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>could</em>, but I like embroidery too much to give it up altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly giving up your craft, considering we\u2019ve moved your tools and table down the corridor and you\u2019re working on our suits for the McCall wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll be the best-dressed couple there.\u201d Stiles grinned smugly. \u201cIncluding the bride and bridegroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we will,\u201d Derek agrees, his smile sincere. \u201cNow, are you going to get out of bed soon? We have to ride into town to do an inspection on your parent\u2019s house, make sure the new tenants are keeping it in good condition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t I have a little longer?\u201d Stiles pleaded, making his eyes as wide and innocent as possible. \u201cI\u2019m still feeling <em>ever</em> so tired. Especially since we didn\u2019t get to sleep until the early hours of the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d the older man chided, though his ears turned red at the tips, something that Stiles took great delight in. \u201cWe were <em>supposed </em>to have an early night last night. You can just get very \u2013\u201d his eyes travelled down the length of the bedsheets, twisted around Stiles\u2019 legs in a manner that showed just how much he appreciated Stiles foregoing nightwear. \u201c\u2013 distracting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen by all means, my Lord,\u201d Stiles laughed, wrapping his arms about Derek\u2019s neck, his heart giddy with a joy that was almost too great to bear, \u201cAllow me to be even more of a distraction to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace, that\u2019s what you are,\u201d Derek smiled with utter devotion, sinking down to press Stiles up against the pillows, capturing his lips in a deep, lingering kiss. Stiles sighed blissfully against his lover\u2019s lips as Derek\u2019s hands wandered, pushing the linens down and out of the way, his fingers a searing brand against bare skin. Someday, he thought idly as Derek\u2019s larger frame covered his, he\u2019ll become accustomed to the storybook, magical perfection that his life had become, complete with the love of his life. Until then, he was glad to keep marvelling.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, they were quite late for tea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>THE END</strong>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e161/Yiji/Fic-Line-Break-Image_zps040a7dc4.jpg\" alt></p>"
