  "text": "<p>The meeting ended. Zuko felt <em>wrong</em> on the inside. He was <em>trying</em>- he was trying so <em>hard</em> to be a good prince, a good son, but it all felt so <em>wrong</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko,\u201d Ozai said, softly. Zuko turned, looking up towards his father. Ozai motioned for him to stay put. The generals rose, bowed, and exited.</p>\n<p>Zuko waited. Azula had slipped out, Zuko wasn\u2019t quite sure when. They were alone.</p>\n<p>Ozai turned fully towards him. \u201cZuko,\u201d he said, \u201cThe former General Iroh will not change his ways. He will not come back to the family. We can\u2019t afford the destruction that would ensue should he escape. It could destroy our country. We have scheduled his execution for one week after the eclipse, along with any other high-ranking prisoners we take.\u201d He set his hand on Zuko\u2019s shoulder. Zuko felt himself stiffen at the contact. \u201cYou understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko was sitting on the ground, not kneeling. His father\u2019s hand wasn\u2019t burning, it was just <em>there</em>. But his eyes were just as cold as they had been at the Agni Kai. Ozai\u2019s eyes were always cold, even when Zuko was burning. Not like Uncle. Uncle was warm and kind and- <em>No. </em>No Zuko didn\u2019t understand but speaking out against things he didn\u2019t understand never helped anyone. So Zuko nodded, and bowed, and left. He found himself walking. He didn\u2019t know where he was going- but he had to get away somehow.</p>\n<p>He came back to himself when he heard Mai call out for him. He was sitting, arms wrapped around his knees, rocking slightly. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure how long he\u2019d been on the palace roof- but based on how dark it was it had been a while.</p>\n<p>Mai looked\u2026 concerned. Her normal blank expression was there, but there were creases between her eyes, her lips slightly more downturned than usual. The expression wasn\u2019t big, but it was <em>there</em>. She sat down beside him, taking one of his hands in both of hers. The silence wasn\u2019t oppressive, but he could tell she was waiting for him to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill Uncle,\u201d he said, voice cracking. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked at Mai, at the alarm on her face, knew he couldn\u2019t let it happen. He\u2019d save Uncle, no matter how much he lost for it.</p>\n<p>Father had trusted him. Father trusted him, and Zuko was going to betray him. But it was wrong, so very wrong to kill Uncle.</p>\n<p>Uncle was a good person, who helped other people. And Father was trying to burn the world to the ground. Zuko knew people in the earth kingdom, people who would die if Father won. Uncle would stop Ozai. Zuko would be betraying his father. But he couldn\u2019t let Uncle die.</p>\n<p>Father deserved to know though, why Zuko was leaving. Zuko would tell him- during the eclipse. When his father couldn\u2019t burn anything. Then he\u2019d free Uncle.</p>\n<p>---\u2026---</p>\n<p>He wrote a letter to Mai, telling her all that Uncle had done- telling her he couldn\u2019t let Uncle die.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He strapped his dao to his back, placing his crown on Mai\u2019s table along with the note. After today- he would be a prince no longer. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014-...\u2014-</p>\n<p>Zuko walked into the underground throne room when the sun went dark. He told his father what he was going to do. His father listened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He started to walk away- then his father spoke of Mother. Despite himself and the voices screaming at him to move- to leave- Zuko listened.\u00a0Eight minutes can pass quickly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko felt fire return- he felt cold. Ozai watched the color drain from his face and stood slowly, lazily. Zuko took a step back, edging towards the door. Ozai stepped forward and flames shot from his palm in a steady stream, superheating the metal of the door. Not quite enough to melt it completely, just enough to trap Zuko in the underground throne room. If he\u2019d had time to think Zuko would have hoped that Ozai hadn\u2019t just melded the door together- if he had, then the Da Li would have to get them out- and asking Azula for anything was like pulling out teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko didn\u2019t have time to think because Ozai was moving, fire roaring from him in a wave. Zuko split it down the middle- dispersing it to either side of himself as Ozai kicked out more flames. Zuko ducked, then slammed a palm forward to send fire back. His fire was pathetic, the weakest he\u2019d produced in years. That did <em>not</em> seem like a good sign.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ozai smiled. He slowed his barrage. Zuko dodged. He didn\u2019t draw his swords, he needed his hands free to keep the fire away from him. Even with all of Zuko\u2019s skill though, he knew Ozai was playing with him. Zuko was like a mouse-rat that kept running from the weasel-snake, not realizing it was already dead. Zuko felt his breath growing short- with the door closed and his father\u2019s flames eating up the oxygen in the room breathing was <em>difficult.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guards had returned and tried to enter the fight, to end it. They, apparently, hadn\u2019t noticed that Ozai was enjoying this. It was a game to him. A game that would end with Zuko dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ozai shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s bad form to interrupt and Agni Kai,\u201d He said, and the guards stayed back.\u00a0If Zuko had been thinking he might have laughed, his father was making a habit of challenging him to duels without his knowledge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flames came down, toward his face. Zuko felt a brief moment of panic before he swept them aside. His left leg caught fire as the fire he\u2019d diverted found something to burn. Zuko gasped, leg failing him as he fell to one knee. Of course he fell on the burnt one. It wasn\u2019t near as bad a burn as his face had been- but his mind flashed back all the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ozai shook his head. \u201cWhat a disappointment.\u201d He said, \u201cIroh was supposed to help you make your bending stronger- but I guess it makes sense. He\u2019s a failure, just like you. I was never going to let you save him, and by now he\u2019s probably already dead. I sent guards to deal with him while the eclipse lasted.\u201d He laughed then, a low, amused sound that was so very, very <em>wrong</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko could barely think through the lack of air and the pain- but that cut through. Father had killed Uncle. Father had killed Uncle. Something red and angry and ugly and <em>dark</em> reared its head inside of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ozai raised his hands, moving them in the oh-so-familiar circular motion as lighting crackled between them. Zuko forced himself to his feet as the lightning came. He raised his arm, directing it, in-down- out. Straight towards Ozai. Ozai barely had time to look surprised before it struck him in the chest. He fell, like the burnt and broken remains of one of Azula\u2019s dolls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko stared. Down at his hands, still tingling from the lightning and trembling from the shock. At his father, lying in a crumpled heap on the ground. Zuko was moving. His burnt leg protested- tried to give out- he didn\u2019t let it. He walked the few feet between him and his father. The guards didn\u2019t stop him- they seemed as shocked as he.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko knelt by his father, two fingers feeling for a pulse. There was none. Ozai\u2019s eyes were wide open in shock and pain. Zuko closed them, gently. He was trembling. Had he meant to kill him? He\u2019d heard that uncle was dead and the lightning... could he have <em>meant</em> to kill his father? Could he have <em>not</em>?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Someone slammed on the door but couldn\u2019t open it.\u00a0Zuko barely noticed. A guard collapsed. Apparently he wasn\u2019t the only one who thought it was hard to breathe in here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, one of the walls slid open. Azula stepped inside, as poised as ever. Then she saw father. And Zuko. For a moment, she froze. He saw her mask slip, saw pain and fear and rage in her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She took a step forward. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAgni Kai,\u201d Zuko found his voice rasping out, \u201cLightning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She said, taking another step forward. Zuko couldn\u2019t find the will to move. \u201cThen I challenge you too. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guards moved further away as she moved. Her kata was perfect, but the flames puttered out just as Zuko\u2019s had moments ago. Her eyes widened and she tried over and over again to get her flames to hit him, burn him. Zuko watched her, and something of her panic deadened his own.</p>\n<p>He stood again, stepped forward. She froze, staring up at him as he placed his hands on her shoulders. Her breathing was ragged, which was rather strange- her breathe control had been impeccable for years. \u201cMine\u2019s doing the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s wrong with it. Give me three months.\u201d</p>\n<p>She seemed to be searching his face for\u2026 something. \u201cYou?\u201d she finally asked, \u201cWhy would I trust you to find anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI found the Avatar in three years. Father gave me a lifetime. If anything, I find things ahead of schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something she saw must have reassured her for she calmed, mask slipping back into place. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d She said, \u201cFor now, I\u2019m going to take care of the prisoners. You can be Fire Lord until you figure out what\u2019s wrong with our bending. Then we\u2019ll have our Agni Kai.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turned, the perfect princess once again, and left the room, her Da Li following. Zuko watched her go. <em>Uncle. </em>He thought suddenly, <em>Uncle. </em></p>\n<p>He was running then, leg protesting every step. But he had to know. Uncle had to be alright, he<em> had</em> to be.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>There were bodies scattered in the hall, some frozen, some burnt, some crushed. Some alive, some dead. Some fire nation- some decidedly not. He needed a healer for the living ones. There was blood. So much blood. Zuko searched through them all. Uncle wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p>He stared around him. Uncle wasn\u2019t there, but that didn\u2019t mean Uncle was alive. He could be dying. He could be dead. He could be alive but injured and Zuko- wouldn\u2019t know. Uncle wouldn\u2019t try to get word to him, he wouldn\u2019t know that Zuko <em>cared</em>. Zuko found a guard, hiding in an otherwise empty cell and sent him for a healer, then went back to the hall with the bodies.</p>\n<p>Someone was coming. He turned- saw Mai. She was holding a crumpled note in her hand. She stared at him, then the destruction around him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cFather\u2026 Father sent men to kill Uncle. He got out. He\u2019s not here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mai hesitated for a fraction of a second, then grabbed his arm. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, \u201cWe need to get you out of here. If Ozai finds you\u2026 you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko didn\u2019t budge. She looked up at him, exasperation and confusion blurring on her normally blank face. \u201cMai,\u201d he said. \u201cI- I\u2019m Fire Lord now. Azula challenged me but her fire\u2019s broke. I\u2019m Fire Lord. I killed him. He told me he\u2019d killed Uncle and he shot lightning at me and I killed him. I killed him.\u201d He was babbling, and at some point he\u2019d started crying and he shouldn\u2019t cry, he knew that, but he couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p>\n<p>Mai stared at him, shock written across her features. Then she wrapped her arms around him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s walls of shock and denial were breaking down. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from leaning into her embrace and crying harder. The guard returned with the healer, and Zuko finally forced himself to move.</p>\n<p>Fire Lord Ozai\u2019s body was cremated that night.</p>\n<p>Zuko was crowned Fire Lord the morning of the next day.</p>\n<p>Zuko stood before his people. They were his now. He\u2019d murdered his father, and now they were his. He felt like his tongue was tied up in knots. But he also knew what he <em>wanted</em> to say.</p>\n<p>The world wasn\u2019t benefitted by the war. The world feared the Fire Nation, hated them, and they, or at least the royal family, deserved it. They had burnt a swath across the world in the name of sharing their prosperity- they weren\u2019t. They were just getting people on both sides killed. These people were his now- and he couldn\u2019t save them if they kept fighting. War just killed people and if the war was going on his people would be dying, and it would be his fault. He also knew he couldn\u2019t tell them this. They weren\u2019t ready to hear that the sacrifices they\u2019d been making had been for nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am honored to stand before you today,\u201d Zuko began, \u201cThe Fire Nation has been at war for a hundred years. We defeated\u201d <em>massacred </em>\u201cthe air nomads. We conquered Ba Sing Se. We lured our enemies into the Caldera itself- and captured some of the greatest threats to the Fire Nation. And now, our people need to have time to rest. It is time for our sons, daughters, fathers, mothers- for our brave soldiers to be called home. The war is over. We won. Now it is time to strengthen ourselves. We begin immediately.\u201d He bowed to his people then. It was probably the shortest speech a new Fire Lord had ever given.</p>\n<p>For a long moment the entire crowd was silent. Zuko didn\u2019t dare look up. The silence stretched. Someone behind him started clapping. <em>Azula? </em>Someone else cheered. The entire crowd roared then, cheering for the family that would soon be coming home.</p>\n<p>Zuko almost smiled. Azula didn\u2019t smile at all. She was considering how hard it would be to get these people to restart the war as soon as she\u2019d gotten her bending back and defeated Zuko in an Agni Kai. Based on how happy they were about their families coming home- it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Zuko started by requesting the clerks go over the profitability of each colony over the last 100 years. He asked them to check how many soldiers were in each place and which colonies they\u2019d lost men in over the last ten years and how many men each and how much effort it was to get overland troops to the colonies and how much it would cost if they did it by airship instead.</p>\n<p>That work was easy. They had the numbers in three days. He then looked at each place and where they went on a map and where the best border- the easiest border would be for the Fire Nation. He was trying to balance what he wanted to give back to the earth kingdom, which places needed to stay in the Fire Nation even in rebellion just because of where they were, and which had become fully part of the Fire Nation long ago. Then the work really began- the work of doing things.</p>\n<p>Ba Sing Se was a nightmare.</p>\n<p>There were millions of refugees in there- thousands of starving people that the city hadn\u2019t bothered to come up with a plan to feed- there wasn\u2019t enough food in the city to split it in an equitable way and there definitely weren\u2019t enough jobs in the city to support those who could work.</p>\n<p>Zuko felt like shouting at someone. He settled for resting his head on his desk and resisting the urge to fall asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cPoor Zuzu,\u201d a voice said from above him, \u201cTired of being Fire Lord already?\u201d</p>\n<p>He forced himself to sit up straight, glaring at her. \u201cWhat in the world inspired you to capture Ba Sing Se? That city is a nightmare full of refugees and seeing as they are part of the Fire Nation we have a responsibility to feed them now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula shrugged. \u201cYou want peace don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko <em>looked</em> at her. She sighed. \u201cGive it back to the Earth Kingdom as a sign of good faith, their bastion of hope returned to them. Should ease negotiations up- if you ever actually get to negotiating with anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko stared at her for a long moment before he felt a grin split his face open. \u201cYou are a genius,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI could hug you right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she said, \u201cWeak or not fire still burns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rolled his eyes. \u201cI never would have guessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula seemed to be waiting for something. He looked at her for a moment longer. <em>Right. Cure fire bending. Or- strengthen fire bending. </em>\u201cI haven\u2019t found the solution yet.\u201d he said. He\u2019d been looking through old scrolls for days. Luckily for him he\u2019d read most of them before, when he was trying to find a way to strengthen his fire bending and impress Father. It hadn\u2019t worked, but the information came back to him now. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The bit about the Sun Warriors had been interesting. Apparently, their bending involved a lot more dancing then fire bending today did, and it was extremely powerful. If they could find time to go to the temple, they might find something. That field trip was not exactly the most important thing right now though.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I think I might have an idea of where we can find an answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo tell.\u201d She said.</p>\n<p>Zuko almost smiled again- strange. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get to go without me do you?\u201d he asked, \u201cI have a trip planned for two weeks from today. We\u2019ll take a day off- go on a field trip- fix our fire- then come back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula sighed. \u201cYou know that if you\u2019ve already planned a trip I can simply figure out where the trip is to from one of the servants and go without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko felt tired again suddenly. He always seemed to find a way to give people excuses to leave. He\u2019d been bad at bending so Azulon had ordered his death- which had made Mother leave him behind and never come back. He\u2019d betrayed Uncle so Uncle had to leave him behind to. He\u2019d murdered Father- and so Father had left him behind as well. Azula was the only family member who hadn\u2019t abandoned him yet, and even if she was crazy he didn\u2019t really want her to go. But he wouldn\u2019t- probably couldn\u2019t- stop her.</p>\n<p>He wanted to yell at her- command her to stay- but he doubted it would work. And he was tired. So instead he tried to smile at her, failed, and got back to work.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAang!\u201d Sokka shouted. \u201cYou need to learn fire bending!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang\u2026 didn\u2019t seem to be listening. Or he was listening and pointedly ignoring. Rude.</p>\n<p>Sokka had gotten better at sneak attacks though. He ran up behind Aang, tackling him to the ground. Toph laughed. Aang sighed. \u201cYou know I could get you off right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka shrugged. \u201cMaybe if you accidentally bent me off a cliff you\u2019d feel bad enough to learn Fire bending.\u201d He did let Aang up though. Aang rubbed his shoulder. Sokka didn\u2019t feel bad about that, Aang probably deserved it for ignoring him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere am I supposed to learn Fire bending?\u201d Aang asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeong Jeong?\u201d Katara suggested.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere would we even find him?\u201d Aang asked.</p>\n<p>Toph shrugged.</p>\n<p>Sokka hesitated for a long moment. \u201cWe could ask Master Piandao.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara blanched but Toph looked intrigued and Aang looked- resigned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would Piandao help us find Aang a fire bending teacher?\u201d Katara asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said knowledge was supposed to be shared through the nations and he didn\u2019t turn us in or really attack us and he knew Aang was the Avatar. Does anyone have any better ideas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026They didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>If Piandao was surprised by them showing up on his doorstep, he didn\u2019t show it. If he was surprised by them asking him about a Fire-bending teacher he didn\u2019t twitch.</p>\n<p>Piandao was favoring his right arm. It was bandaged. All he\u2019d say about it was \u201cBurn. Not a bad one. Didn\u2019t really even stop me from fighting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fat invited them in. Piandao asked them to wait. \u201cI might know just the person,\u201d he said, \u201cJust broke him out of jail before his execution on the eclipse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Piandao walked out, leaving them in the courtyard. When he came back, someone was following him. \u201cUncle!\u201d Toph grinned, waving at him.</p>\n<p>General Iroh, the Dragon of the West, waved back.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t grinning though, he looked- resigned.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh sat with Aang. He\u2019d started with breathing exercises- Aang had done fine on those. Then he\u2019d tried to get Aang to bend actual fire. That- hadn\u2019t been as successful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared of fire- aren\u2019t you.\u201d Iroh asked.</p>\n<p>Aang hesitated for a long moment. \u201cThe last time I bent fire I burnt Katara.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iroh looked at him for a moment. \u201cIt was an accident wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang nodded emphatically. \u201cI would never burn anyone on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iroh hesitated for a long moment. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s lucky for you that I have some experience teaching students who fear fire.\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cWe have a trip to take tomorrow- to show you what fire is truly like. That it doesn\u2019t need fear- it needs respect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Aang asked.</p>\n<p>Iroh smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d Aang sighed, but he didn\u2019t yell about it.</p>\n<p>Iroh could have cried- because Zuko would have. He didn't.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cFire is life,\u201d Aang said, awed. He grinned at Iroh before executing a perfect Fire-bending move and, finally, producing actual fire.</p>\n<p>Iroh smiled at him, but he couldn\u2019t help but think that this was not the child he\u2019d wanted to have with him on this trip. Iroh smiled- but he couldn\u2019t help but think that Zuko would probably <em>never</em> make this trip. And if they won- when they won- Zuko probably wouldn\u2019t survive the conflict.</p>\n<p>Iroh couldn\u2019t survive the <em>loss</em> of another son- and he refused to survive killing one. Not even for the world.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>They went back to Piandao\u2019s, and they kept training. Iroh threw himself into the teaching because when he was training, he wasn\u2019t thinking about what might happen. He wasn\u2019t thinking about the fact that they were depending on children to save the world. Wonderful, talented children, but children all the same. \u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a week after the Avatar and his team had made it to Piandao\u2019s that the proclamation came- it had come overland instead of by airship because the airships were, apparently, all occupied with troop withdrawal.</p>\n<p>Ozai had died during the invasion. Zuko was Fire Lord. The war was over. The Fire Nation had won. Also, Iroh wasn\u2019t a traitor anymore. Huh.</p>\n<p>Azula hadn\u2019t left without him. Zuko was surprised, until he asked her why and she\u2019d said that he hadn\u2019t actually told anyone where he was going- which was true. The amount of food he\u2019d commanded packed hadn\u2019t helped either because there was a fairly large radius they could get to and back from with that amount of food in a balloon, and it also depended a fair bit on how much overland travel they\u2019d have to be doing.</p>\n<p>It made sense.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d requisitioned the same one he\u2019d packed to escape with Uncle two weeks earlier. He guessed that he was kind of escaping with a family member anyways, so it fulfilled its purpose.</p>\n<p>He left Mai in charge. Ty Lee came with her to wave them goodbye. \u201cOther than keep the palace together- is there anything you need me to do while you\u2019re gone?\u201d Mai asked.</p>\n<p>Zuko shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone else land here?\u201d he said. They\u2019d found that there was a good landing stop by the turtle duck ponds which he fully intended to use as the small-balloon-for-the-royal-family-landing-site.</p>\n<p>Mai shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stepped forward, kissing him on the cheek. \u201cCome back safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko smiled, nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mai smiled back, slightly, before walking back into the palace. Ty Lee waved at him brightly before springing after her. Azula sighed, loudly, behind him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the last two weeks to look at Mai. Now it\u2019s time to go. Or are we really just here to feed the turtle-ducks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko shrugged. \u201cIt probably couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula\u2019s expression didn\u2019t shift.</p>\n<p>Zuko joined her in the balloon- and they were off.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Mai knew that Zuko had been joking when he\u2019d said to make sure no one landed in his spot- but the fact that someone had was troublesome.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mai said, approaching the Sky-bison, \u201cBut I can\u2019t help but notice that you have landed in the official landing spot of the royal family. I would ask that you remove your bison.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three people stood. She recognized all of them. The blind earth bender, the water tribe boy, and Zuko\u2019s uncle. Mai sighed. Of course Zuko would leave today. Of course.</p>\n<p>General Iroh smiled at her. \u201cWell that shouldn\u2019t be a problem then. I am a member of the royal family!\u201d</p>\n<p>Mai looked at him for a long moment. \u201cFire Lord Zuko did say you weren\u2019t a traitor anymore.\u201d She sighed. \u201cPlease move the Bison. Fire Lord Zuko will be coming back to land here, but he won\u2019t be back for a while. You have plenty of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The water tribe boy seemed unhappy. \u201cYou mean we come all this way and he isn\u2019t even here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mai looked at him for a long moment, then sighed again. \u201cDid you make an appointment?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>The boy spluttered for a moment. The blind girl laughed and punched him. \u201cShe got you there.\u201d</p>\n<p>General Iroh frowned. \u201cWhere is Zuko?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Mai shrugged. \u201cHe and Azula decided to go on a fieldtrip together.\u201d</p>\n<p>General Iroh looked incredibly concerned.</p>\n<p>Mai rolled her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. They should be back later today- Zuko couldn\u2019t take very much time off anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMai,\u201d the General said, \u201cHow did Zuko end up as Fire lord?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mai hesitated for a long moment. \u201cThat\u2019s his story to tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue.\u201d The earth bender said. Neither of her companions seemed to appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>They went to ruins- <em>ruins</em> to fix her Fire bending. Azula wanted to burn something. Unfortunately, her fire wasn\u2019t hot enough to burn the living things satisfactorily and stone didn\u2019t like to burn at all.</p>\n<p>Zuko had the audacity to seem <em>excited</em>. Azula could burn him, but then he might not help her anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought us to Sun Warrior ruins to fix our Fire Bending.\u201d Azula said, studying her nails.</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded, still throwing his stupid rocks. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know that there is anything here do you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko turned to her, voice rising. \u201cI don\u2019t see <em>you</em> having any better ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula shrugged. \u201cYou were the one who said you\u2019d find the answer. I made no promises.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko turned completely to her, pausing. \u201cThis was how I found the Avatar. I searched random ruins that I researched he might be until I accidentally found him at the South Pole. I\u2019ve found stupid things before. So just let me do my job!\u201d</p>\n<p>He threw another rock and something popped as an entire section of paving disappeared to be replaced by huge spikes. Zuko looked surprised. \u201cThe rock thing actually worked.\u201d He said.</p>\n<p>Azula looked at him for a long moment. \u201cYou knew there were traps- so you threw rocks hoping to accidentally set them off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded. Azula barely kept herself from sighing. That was <em>Mai\u2019s</em> thing.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want us to dance?\u201d Azula asked.</p>\n<p>Zuko shrugged. \u201cThe Sun Warriors were apparently known for their fire dances.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula did sigh then.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026 He, of course, <em>grabbed</em> it. And they were <em>both</em> stuck in the glop. Apparently, the Sun Warriors were still alive. Strange.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>There were dragons. Real live dragons. Azula should probably try to kill them\u2026 but Zuko was Fire Lord now so he probably wanted them <em>alive</em>.</p>\n<p>They danced as the dragons whirled around them, and then came the flames. They were colorful? Azula didn\u2019t- she didn\u2019t understand. The dragons weren\u2019t teaching them anything- she\u2019d been making blue flames for years- <em>thank you very much</em>. How was this supposed to help her get her bending back? She wasn\u2019t supposed to be weak- she couldn\u2019t be weak- she couldn\u2019t <em>fail</em>.</p>\n<p>She turned- turned to Zuko who would surely be more confused than she was because he was a dum-dum and couldn\u2019t get anything right- and he was laughing. Laughing in a light, joyous way she hadn\u2019t heard from him since Mom disappeared. He held out his hands, spinning, letting the flames dance across him. He grinned at her- and stopped, flames dissipating.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked, reaching towards her. She slapped his hand away. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s just get off this mountain.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded, slowly, but didn\u2019t stop looking at her- looking like he was actually concerned and actually cared.</p>\n<p>The sun warriors surrounded them. Azula let Zuko get ahead, slightly, as their leader told them that they could never leave. And something snapped. Azula found her hands spinning, lightning crackling at her fingertips.</p>\n<p>\u201cAzula!?\u201d Zuko yelled, but she wasn\u2019t listening to him. She threw her lightning at the leader- and Zuzu, idiot that he was, jumped in front of it.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Zuko saw Azula breaking. He just\u2026 just needed to get her home. They could figure out something. He\u2019d find another way to help fix her.</p>\n<p>Then the leader said they couldn\u2019t leave and Azula snapped. He saw what was going to happen before it did. The Sun Warriors didn\u2019t know how to redirect lightning, no one but Uncle and he knew that. Zuko found himself jumping forward before the lightning left her hands.</p>\n<p>He caught it with his left hand. In. Through the stomach. Down. And- and he wasn\u2019t grounded. It couldn\u2019t <em>go</em> out. The lightning was frying him from the inside and he had- had to keep it away from his heart- he slammed into the ground and directed the lightning <em>out</em>.</p>\n<p>He curled up, trying to breathe. It hurt- it hurt like his face had hurt after Father had burned him. Except this hurt was inside and- and Uncle wasn\u2019t here- Uncle hated him and\u2026 Zuko tried to breathe. He thought he saw the dragons again. Strange.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Azula stared at her brother, lying on the ground. The sun warriors were shouting, but none of them were moving to help him- and- and he needed help. Where was stupid Uncle Fatso? He was supposed to <em>be here</em> when Zuzu needed him. That\u2019s what he was for- he\u2019d been there at the Agni Kai- he\u2019d stayed with Zuzu for<em> three years</em>. Why wasn\u2019t he here now- when Zuzu was burnt and broken again?</p>\n<p>Then the Sun Warriors were moving. They weren\u2019t helping Zuzu though- they were attacking <em>her</em>. She dodged and spun their flames away but she couldn\u2019t really fight back and Zuzu was just\u2026 just <em>laying</em> there and why wasn\u2019t anyone <em>helping</em> him?</p>\n<p>Then the dragons were <em>there.</em> The red dragon went to Zuko and the blue one surrounded Azula, blocking her from the Sun Warrior\u2019s flames.</p>\n<p>Azula was trembling- her breathing ragged as she stared at the dragon. It could kill her- crush her- so easily.</p>\n<p>The blue dragon looked at Azula for a long moment, then leaned forward, touching one of its whiskers to Azula\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\n<em>He saved one of mine from his, so I save one of his from mine. We will save him- heal enough of his harm that he may return with you. He loves you. Don\u2019t break him further. You don\u2019t understand our fire- ask him. He will teach you. And he will not mock you for your lack of understanding.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Azula still didn\u2019t understand- but she found her ragged breathing smoothing out. They were helping Zuzu. He was going to be alright.</p>\n<p>Fire surrounded Zuko, but he was not afraid. This fire didn\u2019t burn- instead it eased the burning inside of him. It did not consume- it gave.</p>\n<p>The fire flared once, then went out. Zuko still ached but the sharp, <em>blinding</em> pain was gone. The red dragon stood in front of him. Zuko forced himself to his feet and bowed to it, ignoring the twinge of pain in his chest as he did so.</p>\n<p>\n<em>You saved ours- we saved yours. And you. Yours- needs help. She believes that she is a monster, and since the dead one praised monsters she embraced that monstrosity. Fire is life. Teach her to appreciate life for the sake of life and she will learn to build bright fires once more. </em>\n</p>\n<p>The red dragon nodded to him. Zuko nodded back. As one, the red and blue dragons lifted off once more towards their caves. Zuko found Azula- who had been concealed behind the blue dragon, watching it go with an almost thoughtful expression on her face.</p>\n<p>Zuko stepped towards her. Moving hurt. He winced. She glanced over at him and rolled her eyes. She took two large steps forward, placing one of his arms around her shoulders. \u201cZuzu,\u201d she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a dum-dum but jumping in front of a lightning bolt was stupid, even for you. We need to get you to a healer. I can\u2019t have you dying on me before you fix my fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded. The Sun Warriors let them pass with dark expressions- but none attacked.</p>\n<p>Zuko breathed a sigh of relief as soon as they were out of the circle though. He really wished they hadn\u2019t landed the recreational-field-trip-escape balloon so far away.</p>\n<p>His shirt was rubbing against his chest with every step he took and it hurt worse every time. He kept going though. Azula was supporting him and he certainly wasn\u2019t going to let himself give out before she did- lightning damage notwithstanding.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Azula wanted to burn something. Fuel was still a problem however. Or- more precisely- now that she had something to burn she couldn\u2019t get her fire properly hot enough to actually burn it. She\u2019d set Zuko in the corner of the balloon- but it had taken the two of them bending their meager fires together to get this thing off the ground the first time. Now- she was alone, and while Zuko\u2019s fire would certainly have been strong enough to get them up alone- hers wasn\u2019t. That galled her.</p>\n<p>She felt a sudden urge to growl at the balloon, though she it wouldn\u2019t help. Then Zuko was standing and she wanted to tell him to get back down because she was fine- she was perfect- but he was already there and at this point it would probably hurt his feelings if she rejected his efforts to help.</p>\n<p>She moved aside as he produced the heat to lift the balloon into the air. It was much harder to get it heated up than to keep it hot, and by the time it was hot enough for her to maintain it Zuko was pale- well, paler, and shaking. She told him to go sit down- and he did. That was\u2026 probably not a good sign. Zuko never did anything he was supposed to do. She couldn\u2019t focus on that much though, she had to maintain the fire in the balloon. Last time they\u2019d been sharing the load. This time she was alone, but that was fine, she could do this.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>She couldn\u2019t do this. The balloon was drifting downward and she couldn\u2019t get her flames any bigger, and why wasn\u2019t this <em>working</em>- Zuko was there again. He told her to sit down. She <em>looked</em> at him. \u00a0\u201cWould you just sit down already?\u201d He yelled. \u201cYou need to rest so you can take over when I get tired!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2026 actually made sense. Azula sat down. At some point Zuko had unbuttoned his shirt- she wondered why until she saw the gigantic, angry red scar that covered his chest. How had the lightning even <em>done</em> that? The shirt had probably been chafing against the scar the whole time they\u2019d walked- and he hadn\u2019t said a word. Stubborn fool.</p>\n<p>He stayed at it for an hour before she forced him back. He was going to get himself killed by passing out and falling out of the balloon. Azula went back to heating the balloon. Stupid fire. Couldn\u2019t it tell she just needed to get home?</p>\n<p>Zuko fell asleep in the corner, and Azula couldn\u2019t tell if that was a good thing or not. She wasn\u2019t a healer.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Toph felt it when the balloon touched down. She grinned, running over to Sokka\u2019s room and grabbing him and Uncle. \u201cThey\u2019re back,\u201d she sang, shaking Sokka awake. Uncle, it seemed, hadn\u2019t even fallen asleep yet. He was anxious, worried.</p>\n<p>Toph had noticed that the rooms they\u2019d been given were the farthest away from the Fire Lord\u2019s landing site in the whole palace, but she could bend the walls. She bent them a corridor straight to the landing site. There were two people- Azula and Zuko. Zuko was standing\u2026 oddly. Didn\u2019t affect his volume though.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m fine! It barely aches! I don\u2019t need a healer or a stretcher!\u201d</p>\n<p>She couldn\u2019t hear the reply, still too far away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what a bad burn feels like and this isn\u2019t it! The dragons healed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toph could finally hear the other side of the conversation. \u201cWhich is why you couldn\u2019t leave your shirt touching it. Because it\u2019s all better?\u201d It was obviously Azula but there was something\u2026 different about her stance. Less\u2026 certain.</p>\n<p>Uncle was moving quite a bit faster now- a mixture of relief and a greater dose of anxiety seeming to spur him on.</p>\n<p>The three of them burst into the garden and she felt the moment Azula saw them. Azula\u2019s heartrate spiked for a moment, then fell back down. \u201cUncle,\u201d she said, \u201cHow good to see you again. Watertribe. Earthbender.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko apparently knew how to do that anxious- relieved heartbeat to. He whirled around, nearly falling over in the process. For all that he said he was fine there was definitely something wrong in there.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle?\u201d Zuko said, his voice going slightly squeaky at the end.</p>\n<p>Uncle didn\u2019t really seem to care about that. His heartbeat had gone from anxious-relieved to just anxious. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Uncle asked, and Toph was impressed by how steady his voice was.</p>\n<p>Zuko shifted, gesturing in a way that was probably supposed to reassure Uncle. It did not. \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Zuko insisted. His heart said true, but from the way he was standing he was also obviously <em>not</em>. \u201cI jumped in front of a lightning bolt but I\u2019m really bad at planning and didn\u2019t really think about how I wouldn\u2019t be able to get it out mid-air. But the dragons fixed me up and it barely even aches!\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019d jumped in front of a lightning bolt. That was\u2026 interesting. Uncle\u2019s heart didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with that. Toph grinned. She had to try to make people this anxious- and Zuko was doing it all on accident. Toph was almost jealous.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Uncle was here</em>. Uncle was here, and he was alive, and Zuko really needed to apologize. Uncle would probably still hate him, but Zuko needed to. He\u2019d betrayed Uncle, and he\u2019d tried to make it right, and he\u2019d failed.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t really want to do it in front of the other two though. Which begged the question- what were they doing <em>here</em>? With Uncle? And where was Mai?</p>\n<p>Uncle looked like he\u2019d choked on something unpleasant. \u201cYou jumped in front of a lightning bolt?\u201d and a second later, \u201cYou saw the dragons?\u2019 his voice was strangled. Zuko nodded.</p>\n<p>Azula stepped up beside Zuko, and her gaze was far to predatory. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had it in you,\u201d she said, twirling a piece of her hair with a finger, \u201cKeeping the dragons from Zuko all this time- knowing that you could help him improve his fire bending so very, very easily, and letting him flounder instead. Really, I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Azula always lies\u2026 Except she didn\u2019t lie about father. </em>No. No, Zuko really didn\u2019t need to think about father right now. \u201cThere are other reasons to not show me the dragons!\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Azula asked, never taking her eyes off of Iroh.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we should ask him. Because he\u2019s <em>right there</em>.\u201d Zuko gestured in Uncle\u2019s direction. Something in his chest pulled uncomfortably. He winced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was unsure of how your loyalty to Ozai would affect the dragon\u2019s inclination to eat you,\u201d Uncle said.</p>\n<p>Zuko looked pointedly at Azula.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you believe him? Just like that?\u201d she asked. She sounded almost amused. \u201c<em>I </em>didn\u2019t get eaten by the dragons. If they thought I was good enough how dangerous could it really be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026 She had a point there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou almost got eaten though!\u201d Zuko shouted it back because- because.</p>\n<p>She looked at him levelly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo at best he thought you were as bad as I am. Does that really make you feel better?\u201d</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say that- you don\u2019t have to be bad to not be good <em>enough</em>.\u201d He\u2019d never been good enough, that was nothing new. So admitting it shouldn\u2019t hurt.</p>\n<p>Zuko wasn\u2019t quite breathing right. He knew that, he knew he should probably fix it, but for all that he\u2019d been fine a few minutes ago his chest was really starting to hurt now.</p>\n<p>He tried to raise a hand and rub his head- tried to make the world stop spinning- but it just\u2026 kept going. His mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton. \u201cI think you were right,\u201d he said to Azula, \u201cThe healer was probably a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>He saw her eyes widen as he started falling but the world was all fuzzy on the edges and everything was going dark. Zuko let unconsciousness take him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Azula managed to keep him from bashing his head into the ground- which was rather impressive considering how heavy he\u2019d gotten. When had he gotten so big? She couldn\u2019t catch him all the way and settled on lowering him to the ground as gently as she could.</p>\n<p>Uncle Fatso was there in an instant and Azula was reminded once more of the Agni Kai. Well, the first one anyways. Uncle studied the angry red burn that marred Zuko\u2019s stomach for a long moment before he glanced at her. She didn\u2019t know why- it wasn\u2019t <em>her</em> fault Zuko had jumped in front of a lightning bolt she\u2019d been aiming at <em>someone else</em>.</p>\n<p>He gently lifted Zuko into his arms and Azula was suddenly struck by how much he\u2019d changed since she\u2019d captured him. He wasn\u2019t fat anymore, wasn\u2019t even chubby- she\u2019d have to come up with a new name for him. Annoying.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s head lulled back. Iroh simply cradled him closer and set off towards the infirmary. Azula followed. So did the other two. What were they even <em>doing</em> here?</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p><em>What are we even doing here?</em> Sokka thought. They\u2019d wanted to see what Fire Lord Zuko was planning on doing on Sozin\u2019s comet. Wanted to make sure the war was actually over. See what the fire nation\u2019s position on the Avatar was now. They\u2019d brought Toph to tell them if Zuko was lying, Iroh to get them in, and Sokka to be properly skeptical.</p>\n<p>Iroh loved Zuko and Toph didn\u2019t have enough experience with him to be suspicious. Sokka also wanted to find his father. And Suki. And see if anyone here knew how to defeat Combustion Man. When they\u2019d asked Iroh he\u2019d just smiled at them and said he\u2019d handle it. That answer hadn\u2019t been what Sokka was looking for.</p>\n<p>Now the angry-jerk-with-a-ponytail, who didn\u2019t even have a ponytail anymore, was passed out in Iroh\u2019s arms and they were taking him to a healer. That new burn was\u2026 gnarly. So was the old one.</p>\n<p>Maybe he was collecting burn scars. It certainly made him look scary- when he wasn\u2019t passed out.</p>\n<p>Iroh didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t even pause at any of the intersections- which made sense. He\u2019d lived here a long time after all. Sokka glanced to the side, but instead of Toph <em>Azula</em> was there.</p>\n<p>Sokka did not yelp. It was a very manly sound that left his throat. Azula smirked. Sokka glared back, turning to his other side. And there was Toph.</p>\n<p>\u201cToph,\u201d he said, \u201cWas Zuko lying about anything back there?\u201d He didn\u2019t know how that information could be useful- but if he was lying about something Sokka\u2019d feel better knowing what it was so that later he could figure out why.</p>\n<p>Toph shook her head, \u201cNo. Not that I could tell anyways. Good liars might run in the family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula sounded supremely amused. \u201cZuzu? Good at lying?\u201d she laughed, and the sound was all\u2026 off. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t lie to save his life.\u201d That last was said\u2026 softer.</p>\n<p>Sokka glanced at her. Mai hadn\u2019t answered but\u2026\u201cHow\u2019d he end up as Fire Lord anyways?\u201d Sokka asked.</p>\n<p>Azula sighed. \u201cI just told you. Zuko can\u2019t lie to save his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka opened his mouth but Azula spoke before Sokka could ask what that even <em>meant</em>. \u201cFather told Zuko he was going to kill Iroh. It was a test of course- to make sure he was still loyal after all his years away. Zuko seemed to be doing well. Then he showed up during the eclipse and told Father that he wouldn\u2019t let Iroh die. Father distracted him, kept him from leaving until the eclipse ended. Then he attacked. During the fight the guards tried to intervene but Father told them it was an Agni Kai, making his own murder technically legal. Father decided to gloat- told Zuko Iroh was already dead- that he\u2019d sent guards to kill Iroh during the eclipse when he couldn\u2019t defend himself. Apparently he didn\u2019t know that Zuko could redirect lightning.\u201d Azula shrugged. \u201cFather was dead. I dealt with the prisoners. Zuko ran to Iroh\u2019s prison- impressively fast considering the leg- got a healer for the few people in there who were still alive- then got crowned Fire Lord in the morning. Ended the war and cleared Iroh\u2019s name a day later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka blinked. That was <em>so</em> messed up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Azula had spoken loud enough for Iroh to hear. Sokka wondered if she intended it to be kind or cruel.</p>\n<p>Or if she just didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>Sokka sighed. This was not how he\u2019d wanted the trip to go.</p>\n<p>Mai was <em>not</em> happy. She was never happy, but that was besides the point. Finding somewhere else to put the bison had taken forever. Their stalls hadn\u2019t exactly been sized to fit ten-ton monsters, and this monster wouldn\u2019t consent to being put in anything vaguely resembling a cage anyways.</p>\n<p>So she\u2019d been forced to take the stupid thing almost entirely out of the city- the avatar\u2019s friends couldn\u2019t do it of course, they were too busy waiting for Zuko- not like she\u2019d technically been waiting longer anyways\u2026</p>\n<p>Now she was back. Zuko had come back too. Apparently Zuko had been struck by lightning. Her <em>not-happy</em> state became slightly more aggressive.</p>\n<p>What had they been <em>doing?</em></p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>The healers were frankly baffled. Apparently, with the amount of scarring the lightning had caused Zuko really should be dead by now- instead it was like the wound had already been healing for weeks, at least in some places. Other places it looked newly burnt.</p>\n<p>The fact that he didn\u2019t wake up during the examination was\u2026 concerning.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Zuko woke up slowly, like he was rising through layers of fog. He was greeted by a familiar sight. Uncle. Zuko hesitantly pushed himself up. His chest still ached, but there were bandages on it, tight enough that they didn\u2019t rub which was nice.</p>\n<p>Uncle looked\u2026 different. Harder than the man he\u2019d been with for the past three years.</p>\n<p>He still snored the same though, which was a bit of a relief.</p>\n<p>Zuko felt\u2026 hungry. Ravenous really. He slid off the bed, careful to stay quiet. He wanted to talk to Uncle but he really didn\u2019t know what to say. He slid the door open quietly. There were two guards outside, Zuko sent one of them to get food. The man didn\u2019t seem happy about the request, but he didn\u2019t refuse either.</p>\n<p>Zuko closed the door as softly as he\u2019d opened it and crept back to the bed, careful not to wake Uncle up.</p>\n<p>He still felt exhausted, whatever the dragons had done to heal him had taken a lot out of him as well. He slipped under the covers and let his eyes close, just for a moment\u2026</p>\n<p>He woke up a second time to the door banging open. He started, sitting up and wincing as something inside of him complained at the sharp motion.</p>\n<p>Uncle woke up too, and a servant carrying two trays of food came in. The servant placed the food on a small table that sat in between Zuko\u2019s bed and Uncle\u2019s chair and bowed. \u201cIt is an honor to serve you Fire Lord Zuko. Do you require anything else?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>Zuko shook his head. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded to him and left the room. Left him alone with Uncle. Zuko swallowed, finally looking over. Uncle was studying him, his face almost impassive. Zuko could see a twinge of worry in it though.</p>\n<p>Zuko forced a breath in, then out. He could do this. He looked straight at Uncle. \u201cUncle,\u201d he started, stopped. Looked down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I betrayed you in Ba Sing Se and that I didn\u2019t come to get you out of the prison sooner and that I got banished so you had to be away from home for years and that I didn\u2019t listen to you at all and\u2026\u201d And Uncle\u2019s arms were around him. Zuko had a feeling that Uncle would be holding him a lot tighter if he wasn\u2019t worried about Zuko\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>Zuko was crying.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko\u2026\u201d Uncle said, voice soft but pained \u201cI was happy to follow you after your banishment. You stood up for what was right, and I was very proud of you. Even after Ba Sing Se, I was never angry at you. I was sad, because I\u2019d thought you had lost your way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko felt like something inside of him was cracking. He made a sound that was a mangled version of laughter and sobs. \u201cI don\u2019t think I even found my way.\u201d He said, \u201cI was going to let you out- I didn\u2019t want to betray him and I told him I was going to let you out and then he said you were already dead. That he\u2019d never have let me save you and I killed him. I killed him and he\u2019s dead and I don\u2019t even know how to be Fire Lord and Azula\u2019s fire broke and I\u2019m trying, trying to end the war but I think I\u2019m forgetting more things than I\u2019m remembering and I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle was still holding him, gently rubbing Zuko\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd I believe that I can help. I spent a great deal of my life preparing to be Fire Lord after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko leaned further into Uncle\u2019s embrace, and his laugh was more genuine this time. \u201cThat sounds good,\u201d he said, and he meant it.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh sent Sokka and Toph back to retrieve Aang and Katara. The Fire Nation was no longer a danger to the Avatar, and they would need his support to start peace negotiations with the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes.</p>\n<p>Neither of them were particularly happy to leave him alone with his family, but he waved their concerns away. He wasn\u2019t called the Dragon of the West for nothing.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Azula was training, but no matter how many times she went through the motions her fire stubbornly refused to burn any brighter.</p>\n<p>She growled at the flames, angry at their disobedience. Yelling was more Zuko\u2019s thing than hers, but she\u2019d seen his fire. His way seemed to at least <em>work</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAzula!\u201d she heard someone yell. <em>Zuko? </em>What was that fool even doing out of bed? Hadn\u2019t anyone told him he was supposed to rest after getting hit by lightning? Not that he\u2019d rested much last time either, but that time the lightning hadn\u2019t burned him up from the insides.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you need Zuzu?\u201d she asked, carefully studying her fingers and not the way he was walking, far more slumped than usual.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help you with your fire.\u201d He said, simply, like it should have been obvious.</p>\n<p>She looked at him for a long moment. He wasn\u2019t even going to make her <em>ask? </em>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, and she hated the fact that she\u2019d actually let the word out of her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promised to fix your fire, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he said, giving her a slightly pained half smile, \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t fixed yet. Don\u2019t worry, the dragons gave me some pointers.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waved at her to follow him, and after a moment, she did.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">Chapter Six</p>\n<p>Zuko led her to the turtle duck pond.</p>\n<p>Azula watched him for a long moment as he sat down, wincing slightly as he took two loaves of bread and holding one out to her.</p>\n<p>They were by the turtle-duck ponds. Azula knew he liked it here but<em> I\u2019m going to help you fix your fire</em> and <em>I brought you to the turtle ducks and have bread for you to throw at them-</em> were two thoughts that didn\u2019t click in her mind.</p>\n<p>She stared at him for a long moment. \u201cYou want me to feed the Turtle-ducks.\u201d She said. She made no move to accept the bread. He nodded, and his lips didn\u2019t even twitch. He looked completely serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you want me to feed the turtle-ducks?\u201d Azula asked. She didn\u2019t like asking questions- at least not like this. She liked knowing the answers before she asked the questions and watching people sweat- she didn\u2019t like being\u2026 confused.</p>\n<p>Zuko still held the bread out towards her, hand unwavering. \u201cThe dragons,\u201d he said- stopped. Started again. \u201cThe dragon\u2019s fire was amazing, so many different colors, blending together adding to each other, a tapestry of life. Fire is life. Before, I saw fire as a way to please Father, to make him proud of me. Now Father is gone. He can\u2019t be my motivation, and I don\u2019t want to find something else to be angry at. Fire is life and to truly appreciate fire you need to be able to truly appreciate life- no matter what that life can and cannot do for you. So, turtle-ducks. You see them as useless, but if you can come to appreciate their life, not as something that has use to you, but just as something that <em>is</em>, your fire will grow for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula took the bread, but the only part of his speech she thought she really understood was that turtle-ducks were useless. She fed them anyways. Fire was worth it.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0Sokka was having a bad day. He\u2019d forgotten to ask Zuko <em>anything</em>. Iroh had apparently decided that since Zuko wasn\u2019t as bad as he could have been he got a free pass for everything and it was perfectly safe to bring the Avatar back to the Fire Nation. Not only that but he\u2019d decided to stay with Zuko!</p>\n<p>Which would actually be understandable, if Iroh was there to make sure Zuko didn\u2019t do anything sneaky and set up a trap for them. But Sokka could just tell that wasn\u2019t what was going to happen. Iroh was overjoyed that Zuko wasn\u2019t \u201clost\u201d or whatever and would turn a blind eye to anything the man did at this point.</p>\n<p>Sokka had gone to be a voice of reason! To be the properly suspicious one! Instead, he was the kind of random one who never even got to talk to Zuko and was flying back to Aang before he knew what he was doing.</p>\n<p>It left him with two options, admit that he\u2019d failed or wholeheartedly throw his support behind Zuko and hope it turned out well. Either way was a bit of a gamble, and Sokka preferred better odds.</p>\n<p>Sokka was still shouting at himself internally when he saw that Piandao\u2019s mansion was on fire.</p>\n<p>That\u2026 wasn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Aang was having a bad day. He\u2019d been excited that everyone was going to see Zuko except Katara, he\u2019d have so much time with her! And alone too!</p>\n<p>But she hadn\u2019t really seemed to want to be alone with him, at least not hanging out. Sure, they\u2019d done some stuff but it was like she couldn\u2019t stop training. Or talking about Zuko. Sure- the guy had betrayed them all in Ba Sing Se. It was pretty gnarly. But that didn\u2019t mean they had to spend all of their time talking about him!</p>\n<p>Swimming was much more relaxing.</p>\n<p>Aang sat, simply watching Katara as she did the same waterbending katas over and over and over again. He loved her, and he loved watching her, but he hoped that she\u2019d stop eventually.</p>\n<p>Aang sighed again, glancing to the side as he did so and saw something glinting out of the corner of his eye. Something that wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. He jumped, the air around him thrusting him higher as the rock he\u2019d been sitting on exploded.</p>\n<p>That\u2026 wasn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Azula had left hours ago, saying that she had important things to do with her time and didn\u2019t need to feed the stupid turtle-ducks anymore. Zuko had let her go.</p>\n<p>Mai had found him shortly after, and they just sat together and talked. It was peaceful here, by the pond. Uncle was taking care of things for the day so that Zuko could heal, and Zuko was alright with that. Uncle had always been there and willing to take care of him if only Zuko would let him.</p>\n<p>Before, Zuko hadn\u2019t been willing to let anything go. Hadn\u2019t been willing to delegate anything. But with father gone- what was the point of trying to be so strong anymore? Of not needing anybody? Sure, Azula probably thought he was weak for accepting help but she was going to challenge him to an Agni Kai as soon as her fire was strong enough anyways, so he didn\u2019t really need to fight for her opinion of him.</p>\n<p>Something roared in the skies above them. Mai helped Zuko stand and he turned towards the royal family war balloon landing spot. Uncle had convinced him to move the balloon for now, just so that the Avatar and his friends would have a place to land that was close. Zuko had allowed it because he didn\u2019t really see himself needing the balloon anytime in the near future.</p>\n<p>The first thing he noticed when they jumped down was how scorched they all were. The soot clung to them and their clothes were charred in some places.</p>\n<p>That\u2026 wasn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Zuko asked before his brain could stop him.</p>\n<p>Katara glared at him. \u201cSome crazy guy keeps trying to kill us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d Zuko asked, feeling suddenly cold.</p>\n<p>Sokka answered. \u201cHe got this weird eyeball in the middle of his head that explodes stuff. He\u2019s bald and has a metal leg. He doesn\u2019t really talk- just explodes things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew I was forgetting something,\u201d Zuko muttered.</p>\n<p>Toph turned towards him slightly. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him off,\u201d Zuko said, \u201cJust need a pen. And paper. And money.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara\u2019s glare had somehow intensified. \u201cHow are you going to call him off?\u201d she asked. Her tone was decidedly frosty.</p>\n<p>\u201cI kind of hired him a while ago?\u201d Zuko said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry though- I\u2019ll pay him double to stop. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Katara was almost shrieking now. \u201cYou send an assassin after us and all you can say is it\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just said I\u2019ll call him off!\u201d Zuko was yelling. He winced. That hurt\u2026 something. His burn was acting up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it okay!\u201d Katara shouted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry alright!\u201d Zuko yelled back, \u201cI just panicked! I didn\u2019t want to be banished again- I really didn\u2019t want to lose the other half of my face- and that doesn\u2019t make it right but I really am trying! I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so bad at being good!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara was opening her mouth to shout again when Toph butted in. \u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth. Has been the whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know he isn\u2019t just lying like Azula?\u201d Katara said, pointing at him while also pointedly not looking <em>at</em> him. \u201cThe whole family is crazy! And didn\u2019t he just kill his own dad like two weeks ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s heart squeezed painfully at the reminder.</p>\n<p>Mai had been standing at his side, with his arm slung over her shoulders, letting him lean on her.</p>\n<p>Now she stepped forward, away from him. \u201cTheir family is crazy.\u201d She said, voice characteristically flat. \u201cA lot of crazy crap has happened to all of them. Despite all of that- Zuko turned out pretty good. And he can\u2019t lie to save his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her lips twitched up in some semblance of a smile and Zuko found his expression echoing hers. It was times like these that reminded him why he didn\u2019t hate Mai.</p>\n<p>Toph turned slightly towards Zuko. \u201cLie about something.\u201d She said.</p>\n<p>Zuko blinked, glancing at Mai. \u201cI hate turtle-ducks?\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cContinue.\u201d Toph said.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurtle-ducks are worthless and it\u2019s fun to burn them because I can and I have great blue fire and Father always liked me best.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thought he was doing a pretty good Azula impersonation- but the last part had kind of popped out without him telling it to. If he could glare at the words that came out of his mouth he would have.</p>\n<p>Toph nodded at Mai. \u201cYou\u2019re right- he can\u2019t lie to save his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t make Katara stop glaring, or Sokka for that matter, but Aang looked almost completely relaxed. Strange fellow.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Zuko sent a messenger hawk to his assassin, the fastest one he could find. The message was simple-</p>\n<p>\n<em>Meet me where I hired you first in one week\u2019s time. I will pay you double to stop trying to kill the Avatar. My plans have changed.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The assassin would know what it meant, and hopefully this whole mess could be sorted out without too much more trouble.</p>\n<p>Uncle had been disappointed when he\u2019d figured out that Zuko had sent and assassin after the Avatar and his friends. He had winced when he realized that Zuko had come to him for advice <em>before</em> deciding that the assassin was the way to go. He hadn\u2019t said anything about it after that.</p>\n<p>Azula had said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had it in you. Ruthless.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019d seemed almost impressed with him, and it probably said something about his mental state that he craved her praise. Anything she praised Father would like too after all, and even though the man was dead, Zuko still wanted\u2026</p>\n<p>He wanted something that had never existed. A father that loved him. A noble cause. His father to want him, his father to be proud of him.</p>\n<p>The man was dead, but he\u2019d left his mark, and that mark wasn\u2019t fading quick enough.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh resisted the urge to sigh. Katara had been ranting at him for almost an hour now, about how he couldn\u2019t trust his nephew, about how he\u2019d sent an assassin after then, about how he\u2019d betrayed them all in Ba Sing Se, about how her mother had died\u2026 the list went on.</p>\n<p>Iroh listened carefully and didn\u2019t interrupt. This was something she needed to get off her chest. Something she needed to be able to work through.</p>\n<p>Finally, she paused for breath. \u201cI am sorry for all the harm the Fire Nation has caused you,\u201d Iroh began gently. \u201cTo lose a mother is a terrible thing indeed. May I tell you a story?\u201d</p>\n<p>She wasn\u2019t happy about it, but the whole group shifted closer. He told them of his son\u2019s death. How almost immediately after the news had arrived Azulon was dead, Ozai was Fire Lord, and Ursa was gone. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened,\u201d Iroh said, \u201cBut the timing\u2026 cannot be a coincidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>He continued, telling them about a young boy who missed his mother terribly, and a father who didn\u2019t care. Then came the war council, and the Agni Kai. Iroh swallowed down bile as he recounted the duel again, if it could even be called a duel.</p>\n<p>Aang wasn\u2019t the only one who looked horrified at the end of it. Iroh told of their banishment, of Zuko\u2019s dreams being bashed time and time again.</p>\n<p>He skipped ahead, to when Zuko had come to him. <em>I\u2019m so confused, I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. </em>Iroh had looked away.</p>\n<p>And Zuko, in Zuko fashion, had done something rash. \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely his fault,\u201d Iroh said. \u201cI know that much of the blame does lie on him, but\u2026 at the same time\u2026 the things we learn as children are not easily forgotten.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t over yet, these children definitely didn\u2019t trust Zuko, but all of them were thawing. It would take time, but eventually they would see Zuko as the wonderful person he was. Eventually even <em>Katara</em> couldn\u2019t deny that the sun shone.</p>\n<p>They had a meeting in the morning. Iroh, Azula, Mai, Ty Lee, Katara, Sokka, Aang, Toph and Zuko all in one room and not attempting to fight, kill, maim or capture one another. It was truly unprecedented.</p>\n<p>For a long moment an uncomfortable silence reigned. \u201cTea?\u201d Iroh asked.</p>\n<p>Zuko stared at him for a long moment. He hadn\u2019t even had breakfast yet and Uncle wanted tea? Well, it <em>was</em> Uncle. \u201cI\u2019ll order some.\u201d He said, standing and making his way over to the door. The guard doesn\u2019t complain about being sent on a tea run, so Zuko figured it was probably okay.</p>\n<p>He walked back to the table. Moving still hurt a little bit, he rubbed his chest absently.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Zuko said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to end the war. I\u2019ve figured out the new borders that would be easiest to maintain for the Fire Nation and would allow for a minimal military presence, but we need the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes to be willing to negotiate for an official end of the war. In an effort to show our desire for peace, we are willing to give Ba Sing Se back to the Earth Kingdom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula\u2019s lips twitched at that. \u201cWe have several problems. One, we don\u2019t have any ambassadors. So we don\u2019t really have anyone that can negotiate. Two, no one seems to know where King Kui actually went. We\u2019ve considered having them elect a leader and that idea seems to be met with cautious acceptance, but it would really be better if we could actually find the king.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Omashu?\u201d Aang asked. \u201cBumi is a prisoner there and can\u2019t they get that city back too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko blinked at him. \u201cBumi took his city back singlehandedly during the eclipse. I don\u2019t think you have to worry about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang grinned at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to negotiate with the Water Tribes then you\u2019ll want to talk to Hakoda.\u201d Sokka said.</p>\n<p>He had a look on his face- one of those I\u2019m-manipulating-you looks that Azula had grown out of. She was much sneakier now.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe leader of the Southern Water Tribe?\u201d Azula asked, leaning forward slightly. \u201cAnd I assume Zuko will also want to talk to Suki, leader of the Kyoshi Warriors?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Much sneakier</em>. \u201cI assume that they were involved in the invasion?\u201d Zuko asked.</p>\n<p>Apparently that wasn\u2019t the right thing to say. Sokka\u2019s expression darkened and Katara\u2019s became downright murderous. Or- more murderous. Really, it didn\u2019t change much. Aang winced and Toph shook her head slightly.</p>\n<p>Azula was smiling. That\u2026 wasn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>Ty Lee spoke, \u201cSuki was one of the Kyoshi warriors we defeated and dressed up like so we could infiltrate Ba Sing Se.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula spoke next, \u201cHakoda was part of the invasion. In fact, I believe that both Suki and Hakoda are at the boiling rock.\u201d She tapped a finger against her chin. \u201cStrange,\u201d she said, \u201cHow things turn out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko wished, at this point, that he\u2019d paid more attention to what Azula was doing when she was dealing with the prisoners. He\u2019d been a bit preoccupied at the time but still-</p>\n<p>Sokka was thinking. He had an idea. That would not end well. \u201cWe could get Hakoda and Suki out of the Boiling Rock, legally, today if we left within the next couple of hours,\u201d Zuko said, \u201cOne condition though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka was considering. \u201cWhat condition?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to find the Earth King or have the citizens elect one,\u201d Zuko said, \u201cAnd I need Aang to help me make peace with them. Right now they\u2019re too disorganized to really mount an offensive, but once we give Ba Sing Se back they will find it easy enough to start fighting again. We want to stop the fighting, the war, the death. The Avatar is a symbol, of hope, of peace, if you were supporting our peaceful negotiations it could go a long way to convincing them that we are actually serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>All of them looked surprised by that. Except Katara. She looked suspicious. \u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d Toph said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually what he thinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka was already standing. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing here then?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>He turned to Zuko. \u201cReady to break my dad out of jail?\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula sighed. \u201cHakoda isn\u2019t at the boiling rock yet,\u201d she said, \u201cHe\u2019s still in the palace prisons. He\u2019s waiting for transit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>In the end, Azula led Katara to release her father while Zuko got into the kind-of-royal-war-balloon with Sokka.</p>\n<p>The ride was a bit awkward.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s first girlfriend had turned into the moon. Zuko honestly felt a little bad about that one. If he hadn\u2019t tried to capture the Avatar- if he hadn\u2019t been so selfish- she might still be alive. That was on him.</p>\n<p>Zhao had a hand in it to certainly, but Zuko had had an opportunity to end the man. He could\u2019ve stopped everything from happening before it had even begun. But he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d chosen mercy.</p>\n<p>Was it the wrong choice because Zhao had hurt people, or did Zhao\u2019s actions after being spared not play into the morals of sparing him?</p>\n<p>Zuko didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>Getting Suki out was easy enough, even if she was still mad at him for burning down her village. It was just another example of how far he\u2019d been willing to go to please his father.</p>\n<p>His father was dead now, and you can\u2019t please the dead, but Zuko wondered how far that influence still ran.</p>\n<p>He still didn\u2019t even know if he\u2019d meant to kill the man. He didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>He needed Uncle.</p>\n<p>Meeting with Hakoda wasn\u2019t nearly as hard as Zuko thought it would be. Katara and Sokka attended all their meetings, but Zuko guessed it was only fair because Uncle and Azula came every time too.</p>\n<p>Hakoda wanted his men back- most of them were captured here too. Those who weren\u2019t dead that is.</p>\n<p>He wanted to trade. He wanted money for reparations. He wanted a treaty, forbidding Fire Nation ships from entering Water Tribe waters without permission.</p>\n<p>Katara wanted vengeance for her mother.</p>\n<p>Zuko wanted to stop the fighting. He wanted the war to end and stay ended. He wanted to take good care of his people. He wanted to bring the soldiers home.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t cave on everything. But he didn\u2019t dismiss anything either. He listened. He talked to Uncle, and Azula made her opinions known.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d definitely had a good idea about Ba Sing Se. Zuko listened to her.</p>\n<p>And the week passed quickly.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>At first, Zuko was only going to go alone. He figured it would be quick, find the assassin, pay the assassin, go back home. No reason to keep everyone else up coming with him.</p>\n<p>But apparently Azula had absolutely no qualms about reading other people\u2019s mail.</p>\n<p>So, Mai, Ty Lee, and Azula were all coming with him to pay the assassin. They would stay out of sight. He would meet the assassin, he would pay the assassin, and they would all go home.</p>\n<p>Zuko failed to account for a blind Earthbender who could see with her feet.</p>\n<p>They were almost to the side door out of the palace when she walked in, arms folded. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Toph asked.</p>\n<p>Zuko glanced at Azula.</p>\n<p>Azula smiled back at him, and motioned for him to go for it. Rude. Everyone knew he couldn\u2019t actually lie. \u201cWe are going to pay off the assassin.\u201d Zuko said.</p>\n<p>Azula rolled her eyes, but it wasn\u2019t like it was really a secret that he\u2019d hired the man of that he was trying to fire him. Besides, Toph would have figured it out eventually anyways. She could tell when he lied.</p>\n<p>Toph\u2019s posture actually relaxed at that. \u201cCool.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m coming with.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t really a problem. She could just hide with the others. Easy enough.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>The assassin was waiting for them. The whole situation felt\u2026 wrong. Prickly. Zuko took a deep breath. He\u2019d hired the assassin, now he had to fix his mistake and un hire him.</p>\n<p>Zuko took out the money.</p>\n<p>He tossed it over to the man. \u201cThat\u2019s for stopping.\u201d He said. \u201cConsider the job I hired you for finished.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man seemed to be counting the money. He stood still a moment longer, then nodded.</p>\n<p>Zuko hesitated, then turned. He resisted the urge to look over his shoulder as he walked away. He just needed to get back to- \u201cAttack!\u201d Someone yelled, and Zuko was moving. He spun towards the assassin as the explosion raced towards him.</p>\n<p>Zuko was able to dissipate a great deal of the blast, but it still knocked him backwards off his feet. He gasped as the rough landing tore at the chest wound again, but he didn\u2019t really have time to think about it.</p>\n<p>His little sister, who\u2019s full bending wasn\u2019t back yet, was fighting the assassin now. This was a fairly vacant part of town, but there were still people. People who\u2019d be woken up by the explosions, people who could die in them.</p>\n<p>\u201cToph!\u201d Zuko yelled.</p>\n<p>She was there, beside him. \u201cI need you to get the people out.\u201d He said, \u201cYou can feel them can\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded. \u201cGet them away where this fight can\u2019t hurt them.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could tell she wanted to say no, wanted to stay and fight, but she was the only one who could protect the people around them. She nodded sharply.</p>\n<p>Ty Lee was beside Azula, trying to get close enough to block chi points. Zuko wasn\u2019t even sure if those would work on someone who worked so very differently from any other bender Zuko had ever seen, but he couldn\u2019t think about that now.</p>\n<p>He joined the fight. Flames grew and spun. Azula was doing much better than she had before- Zuko wondered if feeding the turtle ducks was actually helping, or if it was something else.</p>\n<p>Knives flashed, reflecting the fires.</p>\n<p>Ty Lee ducked in close, finally managing to get one of the man\u2019s arms. It didn\u2019t help much- being down an arm didn\u2019t stop this man from bending. Another explosions- only this time Ty Lee was too close. She went down- not dead, please help her not be dead- but not well either.</p>\n<p>Another knife flew. Zuko stared as it hit the assassin dead center on the eye on his forehead.</p>\n<p>The assassin stumbled, shaking his head. He was\u2026 he was going to try it anyways. \u201cGet down!\u201d Zuko yelled, hitting the ground himself.</p>\n<p>An explosion boomed as thick stone walls surrounded the assassin. Toph.</p>\n<p>Zuko breathed a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>He glanced up at the girl. \u201cRemind me to take you everywhere.\u201d He said.</p>\n<p>Toph grinned.</p>\n<p>Azula and Mai were kneeling beside Ty Lee. \u201cHow is she?\u201d Zuko asked.</p>\n<p>Mai glanced up, looking troubled. \u201cUnconscious, could be a concussion. A bit burnt, nothing too serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko breathed a sigh of relief. He glanced back at the dome Toph had built to contain the man\u2019s explosion. Why had the man attacked him? It didn\u2019t make sense\u2026 unless he\u2019d been hired to kill Zuko too.</p>\n<p>He really should apologize for sending this guy after them- he was terrifying.</p>\n<p>Katara followed Azula to the prison her father was held in. She knew she needed to be wary, needed to be cautious, and she didn\u2019t forget. She kept an eye on Azula and a hand near her water pouch, just in case.</p>\n<p>Then the door was opening and her father was just\u2026 there and Katara forgot about being wary for a moment as she rushed into his arms. He was obviously surprised to see her, but he held her tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara.\u201d He said, releasing her, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGetting you out of jail.\u201d She said, grabbing his hand. Azula sighed from behind her and Hakoda\u2019s head jerked up- staring at Azula.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn orders of Fire Lord Zuko you are released from your cell to participate in peace discussions about the end of the war.\u201d Azula wasn\u2019t looking at them, instead she seemed to be admiring her nails.</p>\n<p>\u201cMostly dum-dum just feels bad because of his assassin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula flicked some imaginary dirt off one of her shoulders. Katara briefly wondered if the girl ever wore anything other than armor.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, waving a hand at the two of them. \u201cIf you\u2019re to participate in peace negotiations you need a bath.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was only when Katara found a bath waiting in her room that she wondered whether Azula had been talking to her or her father.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>When Sokka came back with his girlfriend in tow the family reunion got bigger. Hugs were exchanged all around.</p>\n<p>They talked about the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>They let the conversation drift from that, talking about times long past.</p>\n<p>They discussed which things they should demand from this new Fire Lord in exchange for the peace both sides desperately wanted.</p>\n<p>They talked about what they could bend on, when it came to that, and what they could never concede.</p>\n<p>Sokka told Zuko\u2019s stories in a hushed voice. It wasn\u2019t their secret, certainly none of it was their secret to share, but how could they not?</p>\n<p>If they needed to fight Zuko, if he betrayed then again, they needed to know what would make him most vulnerable. A blow to the head would hurt anyone. If Aang was fighting Zuko would putting fire near his face put him out of commission?</p>\n<p>Katara had seen people with wounds deep inside before, people who\u2019d flinched at the slightest reminder of what they\u2019d suffered.</p>\n<p>That Zuko could even bend flame at all after such a thing was a testament to a strength and tenacity far beyond what most people could call upon. Which wasn\u2019t super surprising considering the lengths he\u2019d gone to try to capture Aang, how far and hard he\u2019d chased them across the world.</p>\n<p><em>So he could get home, </em>a voice inside of her whispered, and she crushed it.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>When Toph woke Katara in the middle of the night and told her to bring her waterskin she knew that something was wrong. She\u2019d expected a fight, not three fire nation teenagers kneeling beside a fourth, waiting anxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Katara asked, voice frosting when she noticed Zuko. She didn\u2019t like the rest of them, but they were better than Zuko. That was the <em>point.</em> She\u2019d never liked them. They\u2019d never tried to convince her to. They\u2019d never betrayed her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were calling off the assassin.\u201d Toph said, blunt as ever. \u201cHe attacked Zuko.\u201d Katara felt a small moment of satisfaction. <em>How does it feel to be betrayed</em>, she thought, looking at him as he rubbed at his chest, grimacing. \u201cTy Lee got hurt before we took him down. Can you heal her?\u201d</p>\n<p>She could. Katara stepped forward and the others backed away as she got to work.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYour bending was much better when you were fighting the assassin,\u201d Zuko said, as they watched Katara work.</p>\n<p>Which was obvious. Why wouldn\u2019t he just ask what he wanted to? Why couldn\u2019t he just explain why it had been better? Was it that she had a live target?</p>\n<p>Zuko had fallen silent. \u201cDum-dum,\u201d Azula said, and Zuko started.</p>\n<p>The fact that he responded to that name spoke a great deal about him. Azula would never respond to something so demeaning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you thinking about when you were fighting him?\u201d Zuko asked, \u201cWhat were you fighting for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula moved to speak and found that she couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d\u2026 she\u2019d been angry that he\u2019d dared attack Zuko when Zuko was <em>hers</em>, and he was hurt, and he couldn\u2019t defend himself properly on a good day.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d been with Mai and Ty Lee and Zuko, and they\u2019d all fought together. They\u2019d been a team. They\u2019d been together, and it\u2019d felt right. She\u2019d\u2026 she\u2019d been trying to <em>save</em> them. It was a strange thought, Azula trying to save anyone, but\u2026 she had.</p>\n<p>Azula glanced down at Ty Lee. It obviously hadn\u2019t worked.</p>\n<p>Katara finally sat back. \u201cShe\u2019ll be alright. The damage wasn\u2019t to bad. I\u2019ll want to work on her again tomorrow, but she\u2019ll be good as new in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tension in the room eased.</p>\n<p>Azula glanced at Zuko, then frowned. He was wavering on his feet. Stupid of him to stand so long, fight so long, while still healing.</p>\n<p>Zuko rubbed at his chest, frowning. He let out a sound, something between a groan and a whimper, then his eyes rolled back in his head as he collapsed.</p>\n<p><em>You really needed to stop doing that,</em> Azula thought. <em>I won\u2019t always be there to catch you.</em></p>\n<p>But she was here this time. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Azula knelt beside Zuko, pressing two fingers against his neck. His pulse was strong. She frowned. He was probably just tired.... but she\u2019d seen him do far more in arguably worse conditions and he\u2019d never <em>collapsed </em>like that.</p>\n<p>Toph was beside them now. \u201cKatara,\u201d she said, \u201cCan you check up on him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katara\u2019s head snapped towards Toph, expression somewhere between horrified and enraged. She smoothed her expression a second later, taking a step forward.</p>\n<p>Azula stood, placing herself between Katara and Zuko. Toph might be able to feel lies, or most lies, through people\u2019s heartbeats. (Azula\u2019s heart was not a traitor though, so it didn\u2019t work on her). Azula could see lies- she knew <em>people.</em> And Katara did not want to help Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I commend the thought behind it,\u201d Azula said, standing straight and tall while also making sure to seem relaxed, in control, \u201cI can\u2019t let you come and kill the Fire Lord. If you did that <em>Iroh</em> might end up in charge.\u201d</p>\n<p>She still hadn\u2019t come up with a new nickname for the man. It was becoming rather annoying. What kind of a name was Iroh anyways? What was with four letter names?</p>\n<p>Ozai, Ursa, Iroh, Zuko\u2026 Even Aang and Toph.</p>\n<p>Azula had five letters\u2026 which made her name the same length as Sokka\u2019s. No. She had nothing in common with the Water Tribe boy. Perish the thought.</p>\n<p>Katara looked affronted. Like she was so used to being treated as an angel that she\u2019d forgotten what it was like to be treated with suspicion. So used to being on the right side that she couldn\u2019t comprehend someone who questioned her intentions.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve healing,\u201d Katara said, voice a low hiss, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make me a monster. I wouldn\u2019t kill him, not like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>True. She wouldn\u2019t kill him intentionally\u2026 that didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d be gentle. Healers didn\u2019t always need to be gentle. Still\u2026 Healing was a delicate art. It was far to easy to mess up if the healer was tired or angry.</p>\n<p>Katara was a healer and a Waterbender. The dragons\u2026 they\u2019d been able to heal. With fire.</p>\n<p>Azula didn\u2019t know quite how they\u2019d done it, but she was a prodigy. She could figure it out. \u201cYour services are not needed here.\u201d Azula said, firmly, but also flippantly, like she couldn\u2019t care whether Zuko ever got up again. Like his health didn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>It did of course, she needed him to fix her fire. But they didn\u2019t need to know that she was broken. They knew she was better than Zuko. Zuko was weak now with his injury, she couldn\u2019t afford for them to think she was weak to, especially since Ty Lee had been injured too.</p>\n<p>Katara stalked out of the room, muttering about gratitude. \u201cThank you Katara!\u201d Ty Lee chirped, which was\u2026 probably a genuine sentiment knowing Ty Lee. Toph hesitated for a long moment, then plopped herself gracelessly on the ground beside Zuko.</p>\n<p>Azula didn\u2019t ask her to leave. Never command someone to do something you can\u2019t enforce. Toph didn\u2019t fear her. Toph wouldn\u2019t listen, and the only thing worse than someone who <em>didn\u2019t</em> fear her was someone who knew they had no <em>reason </em>to fear her.</p>\n<p>Firebending comes from the breath.</p>\n<p>Azula hesitated for a long moment, then placed her hands on either side of Zuko\u2019s head, closing her eyes. She aligned her breath with his.</p>\n<p>In. Out. In. Out.</p>\n<p>Warmth, radiating out of him with every breath.</p>\n<p>All Firebenders were unique- everyone had a slightly <em>different</em> inner flame. Azula had felt Zuko\u2019s before\u2026 and this was still Zuko\u2026 but it was- different. Changing. Mutating.</p>\n<p>It was stronger. Much stronger than it had been before.</p>\n<p>Fire flickered, flowed, brightened, banked. She felt the rhythm of his. It was growing at a rate that almost outpaced his body\u2019s ability to keep up with the changes- like a tree that had so much fruit it was pulling down and breaking the branches.</p>\n<p>The dragon\u2019s healing hadn\u2019t just saved his life. It\u2019d done something\u2026 more.</p>\n<p>Azula couldn\u2019t really use Zuko as a test subject for Fire Healing- with the way his fire was acting it probably wouldn\u2019t even be accurate testing. If he was to far off normal than any healing methods she discovered that would work on him might not work on anyone else or vice versa.</p>\n<p>No\u2026</p>\n<p>But what was she supposed to do then?</p>\n<p>There were only two other people who\u2019d been to see the dragons. Aang\u2026 and Iroh.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh wasn\u2019t exactly surprised to be woken up around midnight. It had happened before. He\u2019d been a father, then a military commander, then Zuko had woken him up with his nightmares, then they\u2019d been on the run, then he\u2019d been in prison with a sadistic jailer.</p>\n<p>He just hadn\u2019t expected Mai to be the one to come. Mai looked bored, but then, she always looked like she wanted everyone to know that there were probably so many places she\u2019d rather be than <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>Iroh followed her quite a way into a different section of the castle. He found an injured but chipper Ty Lee sitting up and leaning against the wall, and Zuko laying on the floor, breathing slow and even. Toph was sitting by him while Azula\u2019s hands were on either side of his head, her eyes closed as she breathed with him.</p>\n<p>It might have made a cute picture, might have been something sibling were supposed to do rather than something these siblings seemed to<em> actually </em>do.</p>\n<p>Iroh might have thought about that if he wasn\u2019t so worried. He rushed forward, kneeling beside Zuko as well.</p>\n<p>Azula opened her eyes and, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, removed her hands from Zuko as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeel his fire.\u201d Azula said, nodding to the still unconscious Zuko.</p>\n<p>Iroh frowned, but did as he was told, and after a moment, he saw what she was saying. His fire was growing to fast for him to sustain. It was a forest fire, burning through all available fuel, heading for its death.</p>\n<p>They needed to slow it down, calm it. He had plenty of time to grow- he didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, grow at this rate.</p>\n<p>Iroh breathed with Zuko. Azula hesitated for a moment, then joined him.</p>\n<p>You did not blow on a forest fire- that would make it grow.</p>\n<p>Fire could sometimes be used to combat fire, to create a dead zone in which the fire could not spread, but that was not the point here. They weren\u2019t trying to kill Zuko by burning him out.</p>\n<p>Not air then, not fire.</p>\n<p>Water. Water or\u2026 Iroh turned to Toph. Earth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Toph asked as she felt both Iroh and Azula shift slightly towards her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis fire is growing to fast- it\u2019s trying to consume him.\u201d Iroh said, which really didn\u2019t sound good. \u201cI can\u2019t fix that. If I try I\u2019ll most likely kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Really not good. \u201cKatara might be able to help.\u201d Azula said, \u201cBut she hates him. She might kill him on purpose.\u201d She sighed, \u201cThat leaves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toph was good. She was the best Eartbender in the whole world. But- healing?</p>\n<p>Iroh was talking. \u201cAir feeds flames. Adding more fire to Zuko would be a bad idea. We only have Katara for water, also a bad idea. The two best things for fighting fire are water and earth. For this task, it is important that they can bank flames without destroying them.\u201d</p>\n<p>All true. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Toph asked. She didn\u2019t like this. She didn\u2019t like feeling uncertain. She was the best Earthbender in the world. She shouldn\u2019t have to feel uncertain. She\u2019d figured out metalbending, how hard could this really be?</p>\n<p>\u201cEarth grounds people.\u201d Iroh said, speaking slowly, \u201cSolid. Steady. Dependable. Zuko\u2019s fire needs to be grounded to a manageable level. People are made of all the elements, this includes Earth.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor now, I wouldn\u2019t suggest you do anything. You\u2019re too new at this. But- just try to see if you can find where you would need to begin grounding him.\u201d</p>\n<p>In other words, Iroh didn\u2019t really know enough to say exactly what to do- just enough to give him an idea. Toph could do this. She was the greatest earthbender in the world.</p>\n<p>She hesitated for a second, then buried Zuko, all except his head, in the ground. She made sure to leave enough room for him to breathe- put earth too tight around someone and they\u2019d suffocate even if their head was above the ground.</p>\n<p>Azula\u2019s heart jumped as Zuko went down, though she didn\u2019t move so much as an inch. Interesting.</p>\n<p>Iroh had a similar reaction, but he just lay his hand back on Zuko\u2019s forehead. Well, probably. Her sense wasn\u2019t exactly accurate on stuff like that- she\u2019d of felt the pressure of Iroh\u2019s hand pushing Zuko\u2019s head slightly down on the earth the same if he placed his hand anywhere from Zuko\u2019s nose up.</p>\n<p>People didn\u2019t usually touch other people\u2019s noses though. That was just weird.</p>\n<p>Toph felt the earth around Zuko. She listened to his heartbeat. Steady, strong, but labored. Like it was bearing some heavy weight.</p>\n<p>And now she was supposed to feel inside of him?</p>\n<p>Earth coated him. She could feel the scar on his chest. There was something\u2026 off about that. It felt like it was heating the earth around it- like that little- well, not so little- scar was a mini furnace.</p>\n<p>Iroh had said she needed to bank the flames but not destroy them\u2026 Toph pressed closer. She was gentle, but she pressed Earth against the scar, coating it. Not a good idea in normal circumstances in case it got infected- but it was too far along. She hoped.</p>\n<p>The earth on his chest just heated up. So- no to that idea.</p>\n<p>Still, the fire wasn\u2019t technically in the scar. It was inside of him. Which meant she needed to figure out how to sense the Earth that was inside of him.</p>\n<p>Toph sat, and, as she had done with metal not so long ago, she listened.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>King Kuei was riding his bear into a small town when he heard the deal. <em>As a show of good faith towards the Earth Kingdom, to help begin peace negotiations for the end of the war, we are returning Ba Sing Se to the Earth Kingdom. The people of Ba Sing Se are electing a temporary leader until the king is found or returns on his own. </em></p>\n<p>It was signed <em>Fire Lord Zuko.</em></p>\n<p>Zuko. Not Ozai. When had Ozai died?</p>\n<p>Still- if this message was posted around the whole Earth Kingdom\u2026 was it legitimate? Could it be legitimate?</p>\n<p>It had to be.</p>\n<p>Or maybe it wasn\u2019t\u2026 he needed to talk to someone.</p>\n<p>But who?</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong was tired. He\u2019d deserted years ago. He\u2019d tried to get out. And now his life was just as defined by war as it ever had been before.</p>\n<p>Piandao had contacted him when the assassin had tried to kill the Avatar.</p>\n<p>That particular assassin had owed him a debt from back in their war days. When Jeong Jeong had contacted him, he\u2019d come.</p>\n<p>A debt needed to be repaid. Jeong Jeong asked him who had tasked him with killing the Avatar. It had been Zuko, the young man who\u2019d betrayed Iroh. Who\u2019d left him to rot in prison.</p>\n<p>Iroh had such hopes for the boy. As far as Jeong Jeong could see, they were unfounded.</p>\n<p>Zuko had said he was ending the war. It was such a harmful, hopeful little lie. Get everyone to lower their guard so you can sweep in and kill them all the easier.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong sat and waited for the letter to come. The letter that would say that Fire Lord Zuko was dead.</p>\n<p>The letter that would make Iroh to be Fire Lord.</p>\n<p>Iroh might not be willing to fight Zuko, he wouldn\u2019t have the same compunction against fighting Azula.</p>\n<p>Iroh would be Fire Lord. And all would be the way it was meant to be.</p>\n<p>Toph knew what Earth felt like. Steady. Solid. Strong. Dependable and unbendable.</p>\n<p>Earth in the Fire Nation was\u2026 different.</p>\n<p>Volcanoes were earth. Except that they weren\u2019t <em>all the way</em> earth. Volcanoes were sleeping pools of fire that <em>looked</em> like earth. Unless one felt deeper. Unless one- like Toph- reached down into the Earth and found something- something that was earth- and also wasn\u2019t. Something that <em>did </em>bend, that flowed like water, burnt like fire, and still, through it all, <em>felt </em>like stone.</p>\n<p>The volcanoes Toph had felt were sleeping. They were meant to sleep.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s insides kind of felt like a volcano. One that was erupting before its time. Particles of earth inside of him that were really <em>not</em> supposed to be erupting were doing it anyways.</p>\n<p>Toph couldn\u2019t feel the fire, but she could feel the effect.</p>\n<p>Toph breathed in, then out. This needed fixed. And she thought she knew how.</p>\n<p>But this was more important than metal bending. This was more important than anything she\u2019d ever done before, because this was a person she was messing with. This was Zuko, a real, live person who would die if she did something wrong.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d also probably die if they did nothing.</p>\n<p>Toph wished Katara was here, but if Iroh didn\u2019t trust Katara with Zuko\u2019s safety he probably had a reason.</p>\n<p>Still. Maybe- maybe Toph didn\u2019t have to tame to fire all at once. Maybe she could try just a small section of the prematurely erupting volcanoes- see if she could get them to calm- to cool- to lie dormant without going out completely.</p>\n<p>Earthbending did not come from the breath, but she matched her breathing with Zuko\u2019s anyways. It helped.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Sokka had been sleeping. He\u2019d been sleeping, and Hakoda had been just a room away, and Suki was here too- and everything felt like it was going right because prisoners were going to be released soon and he\u2019d asked Toph and Zuko<em> hadn\u2019t been lying. </em></p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t been lying about wanting peace or seeking peace or giving back Ba Sing Se or <em>any </em>of it.</p>\n<p>Everything had been pretty good.</p>\n<p>But now Katara was stomping into his room and the sun wasn\u2019t even up yet and he really wanted to go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t trust me!\u201d Katara said, gesturing wildly. \u201cI healed Ty Lee because they asked me to and because she needed it. Then Zuko falls over and they won\u2019t let me go near him! Azula thought I was going to hurt him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka blinked, trying to get the sleep out of his eyes. \u201cWere you?\u201d he asked. He seemed to remember her going on, in some length, about how angry she was at the fellow for his betrayal in Ba Sing Se.</p>\n<p>Sokka didn\u2019t mind him so much. They\u2019d gotten Suki out of the Boiling Rock together. That was good enough for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Katara said, \u201cHe needed help! I wasn\u2019t going to hurt him! Even if he\u2019d deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The last part was said in a mutter, but Sokka could see why the still unnamed <em>they</em> didn\u2019t trust her with Zuko\u2019s health. Not that he\u2019d say that out loud. He had some self-preservation instincts after all. \u201cIs he going to be alright?\u201d Sokka asked, and that really wasn\u2019t what he was expecting to come out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Apparently, it was the wrong side of morning for sarcasm.</p>\n<p>Katara growled. Literally. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me look at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it make you feel better if I went to check on him?\u201d Sokka asked, finally managing to convince himself to sit up.</p>\n<p>These beds were really rather comfy compared to what they usually slept on. It was almost uncomfortably comfy- but Sokka was <em>here</em> and these beds were <em>available,</em> and he was going to take advantage of them. So there.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh had said to get up with the sun. Aang had listened. Kind of. He\u2019d let Iroh get him up with the sun anyways.</p>\n<p>But Iroh had seemed so happy to find Zuko and also so drained and Aang thought he could do something nice for Iroh and try to get up on his own. And now Aang was just sitting here, waiting, because Iroh was supposed to be teaching him but Iroh wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p>Aang hesitated for a long moment, then closed his eyes, flexing his toes and planting his feet more firmly on the ground. He wasn\u2019t near as good at this as Toph but-</p>\n<p>He could feel the Earth. He could feel the palace. He could feel people- so many people inside- going about their lives. He could feel farther than that if he wanted to- but he didn\u2019t. Not really.</p>\n<p>Mostly he wanted to find his Fire Bending Instructor.</p>\n<p>Aang was jolted out of it when a Messenger Hawk landed on his head. Aang blinked.</p>\n<p>Then he reached up, letting the hawk land on his arm rather than his head and taking the scroll.</p>\n<p>The message on it was simple.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Avatar Aang, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Is it true? Does the Fire Nation truly wish for peace? Should I go back and try to reclaim Ba Sing Se? Is it a lie? Do they just want to capture me?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I feel very confused. I don\u2019t know who to turn to. It almost makes me wish Long Feng were here, though the man was a traitor. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>King Kuei</em>\n</p>\n<p>Aang blinked. That one was easy.</p>\n<p>He wrote on the back of Kuei\u2019s note.</p>\n<p>\n<em>King Kuei,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fire Lord Zuko is trying to make peace. He\u2019s already released a whole lot of prisoners and is negotiating with the Southern Water Tribe. You should go and get Ba Sing Se back. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Avatar Aang</em>\n</p>\n<p>Aang smiled as he watched the bird fly away. Maybe waking up this early did have some benefits.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong watched, and he waited.</p>\n<p>No word came. <em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Iroh got the whole story of their \u201cadventure\u201d from Azula.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t help but frown, knowing that Zuko hadn\u2019t told Iroh what he was doing. Or at least that he was doing it tonight.</p>\n<p>Iroh could have- <em>should</em> have- been there to protect Zuko.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been asleep instead.</p>\n<p>Still- this was more than a bit concerning.</p>\n<p>Someone had hired that assassin to go after Zuko- someone who either had a lot of money or a lot of connections. <em>Or both.</em></p>\n<p>It would also have to be someone from the Fire Nation. This particular assassin didn\u2019t accept jobs from foreigners, or even the colonies.</p>\n<p>Iroh watched Toph frown as the Earth seemed to shiver around Zuko. He shook his head slightly. He trusted Toph- she would be careful with Zuko.</p>\n<p>Iroh hated leaving, even for a moment, but he stood, moving to the door. It didn\u2019t take long for him to find a servant to bring his things.</p>\n<p>He needed to write two letters. One to Piandao. One to Jeong Jeong.</p>\n<p>He would find out who was trying to kill Zuko- and he would stop them. By any means necessary.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>It was so easy to crush the little flames. Toph knew that she could crush them all if she wanted to- but she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t know Zuko well. They weren\u2019t friends- but she had the feeling that they could be. She felt like she could understand him- at least a bit. Understand how he worked, and, by extension, how his bending worked.</p>\n<p>Too much earth smothered the flames.</p>\n<p>Too little did nothing.</p>\n<p>It was maddening, having to add Earth to the flames by such tiny increments.</p>\n<p>Still, it was Zuko. A person whose life was on the line. She needed to be careful.</p>\n<p>And, finally, when she really needed to find some sort of Earth Kingdom fight club and pound out her frustration- she found it.</p>\n<p>The fire was still there- still burning strong- but it was no longer seeking to consume- to grow bigger and bigger and never stop.</p>\n<p>She needed to do this now- to do it before someone interrupted her. \u00a0Do it before she forgot the correct measurement- before she forgot how. She had to be careful- very careful. She needed to bank all the tiny fires before they burnt him up while making sure not to smother him.</p>\n<p>It was incredibly tedious work- but she did it anyways.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Aang had finally found Toph- and Iroh had been with her. He walked cheerfully down the hallway. He was already doing what he was supposed to be doing- promoting peace, helping people.</p>\n<p>He was so glad that Ozai was gone- that the whole mess with Ozai and killing was over with. Aang didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have been able to kill Ozai. He just couldn\u2019t imagine himself doing something like that.</p>\n<p>When he walked into the room he hadn\u2019t expected to find Iroh, Azula, Toph, Mai, and Ty Lee sitting around in various positiongs with Zuko buried under some rocks Toph seemed to be working on.</p>\n<p>Seismic sense was really supposed to warm him about things like this. Of course\u2026 he\u2019d just been trying to find Iroh and hadn\u2019t really looked past that once he\u2019d seen the man.</p>\n<p>Aang did what he did best. He waved. \u201cHi!\u201d he said. He made sure to smile.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Sokka wasn\u2019t sure if he was supposed to be surprised anymore.</p>\n<p>He kind of wondered why Toph had the Fire Lord tapped under a pile of rocks\u2026</p>\n<p>Mostly though, he wondered when Aang and Ty Lee had managed to get so friendly.</p>\n<p>Iroh seemed to be writing some sort of letter.</p>\n<p>Sokka wondered what it was about for a long moment, then decided that he was too tired to do detective work right now.</p>\n<p>Which\u2026 why was Aang here anyways?</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong read the letter once. Then again.</p>\n<p>It was a full explanation of everything that had happened since Iroh had left the capital, only to willingly return a week later.</p>\n<p>Zuko had killed his father- not as an attempt to gain power- but as an attempt to get revenge for Iroh\u2019s supposed execution.</p>\n<p>Zuko was actually interested in peace and had been having peace talks with the Avatar.</p>\n<p>Zuko planned to return Ba Sing Se to the Earth Kingdom as a gesture of good will.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong read the letter, his bushy eyebrows rising as he took it in.</p>\n<p>How could Iroh- a Grand Master of the White Lotus- have been taken in a ploy like this? Of course- some people were really very good at acting\u2026 Zuko could be one of them. It would make the eventual betrayal so much harder to handle.</p>\n<p>There was only one thing Jeong Jeong could do in such circumstances.</p>\n<p>He was a fugitive. He couldn\u2019t go to the capital himself- but Piandao- the man who\u2019d trained Zuko- could.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong would find King Kuei- and he would keep the man alive to rule Ba Sing Se once more.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Piandao had two letters.</p>\n<p>Two letters from men he admired and trusted.</p>\n<p>One from a concerned Uncle trying to keep his nephew\u2019s alive.</p>\n<p>The other from a concerned man trying to save his friend\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>Both unknowingly at cross purposes. Both still trusting each other.</p>\n<p>This could be\u2026 complicated.</p>\n<p>Actually- this was already complicated.</p>\n<p>Piandao briefly considered setting both letters on fire.</p>\n<p>There was a perfectly good candle with a very nice flame on it just a hands width away. It would be so easy. So very, very easy.</p>\n<p>Piandao sighed. He went to prepared for his journey to the capital instead.</p>\n<p>Piandao arrived at the capitol a week later. He forgave himself for how long it\u2019d taken- after all, most people didn\u2019t have a flying bison. Or an air balloon.</p>\n<p>Iroh had apparently already passed his name and likeness to the guards at the gates, so he was let into the palace proper with very little fuss. A passing servant pointed out when he could find the new Fire Lord.</p>\n<p>Piandao found Zuko sitting by Azula as they fed turtle ducks together.</p>\n<p>Piandao blinked. That certainly wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever expected to see.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t working brother dear,\u201d Azula said, and the impatience in her voice was clear, for all that she\u2019d obviously been trying to hide it. This must really be bothering her for her to lose control like that.</p>\n<p>And for her to not notice him- she was usually very good at things like that. Zuko too in all honesty- the boy wouldn\u2019t have survived this long if he\u2019d been bad at looking out for danger.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy Azula,\u201d Zuko said, smiling at her, \u201cDid you really expect to learn all of the secrets of Fire Bending in a single day?\u201d</p>\n<p>She glared at him. \u201cIt has been weeks,\u201d she said, voice nearly a hiss. \u201cAnd you learned it in a day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s smile faded. He reached towards Azula and almost took her hand, then seemed to think better of the gesture. \u201cIt was actually a lot longer than a day,\u201d he offered, voice softer now. \u201cUncle had been hinting at it for all the years we\u2019d been together- seeing the dragons just made it all\u2026 click. It fit into place and I knew what he\u2019d been talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula did not seem comforted. \u201cPlease tell me you can do better that <em>Iroh</em>.\u201d There was a hint of genuine fear in her voice, a pleading quality to it that contradicted everything Piandao had ever seen or heard from the girl before.</p>\n<p>Azula was always infuriatingly blank faced. She was controlled. She was also a sociopath. She did not empathize with other people or their struggles. She understood people only insomuch as it pertained to making them listen to her. There was always an air of frenetic energy around her- she was being pushed to do better, to be better all the time.</p>\n<p>Here she was nearly desperate, nearly pleading- but the desperate edge to all of her actions was gone.</p>\n<p>Just like Ozai was gone.</p>\n<p>It could not be a coincidence.</p>\n<p>Piandao knew Zuko- had known the boy for years. He knew Zuko was no mastermind- he\u2019d made no plot to take over the Fire Nation. Zuko wasn\u2019t fooling the world into believing he wanted peace.</p>\n<p>This- this relationship with his sister- just confirmed what Piandao had already known. Zuko wanted peace.</p>\n<p>Zuko seemed to come to a decision after a fair amount of mental debate. He took his sisters hand. Azula almost seemed to stiffen, but she did not pull away. He squeezed gently. \u201cWe will fix your fire Azula,\u201d he said, \u201cNo matter what it takes. I will never stop trying to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azula didn\u2019t react, didn\u2019t speak- but she also didn\u2019t pull her hand away.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh watched Zuko bend and felt more than mildly impressed. Zuko had been powerful before- all the Imperial Firebenders were, though Zuko had never quite matched up to the rest of the family in terms of skill.</p>\n<p>Still- this was a new level of power. An almost unprecedented amount.</p>\n<p>What the dragons had done to Zuko in healing him had nearly killed him.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019d also created this- whatever this was. Aang still had more power- but it was closer than Iroh would have expected such a contest to be.</p>\n<p>If it\u2019d been anyone but Zuko it would have scared him. As it was, Iroh allowed himself to take comfort in the fact that anyone trying to kill Zuko now would have a much harder time of it.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong was mildly offended at how easy it was to find King Kuei. It had taken him a week. A week. Had the man no sense of self-preservation? Was he trying to be killed before he could force the Fire Nation to actually give him his city back?</p>\n<p>And the man was whistling. And riding a bear. And his clothes\u2026</p>\n<p>Actually, that was probably smart. Even someone who knew what they were looking for would have problems believing that this was the Earth King.</p>\n<p>\u201cKing Kuei,\u201d Jeong Jeong said as he stepped out of the woods several feet in front of the man. He didn\u2019t bother softening his voice or moderating his tone. He didn\u2019t soften himself for other people. He was who he was. He would not give into the pressure of being someone else again.</p>\n<p>The King jumped and nearly fell off of his bear. Jeong Jeong sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d The King asked, eyes narrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am Jeong Jeong,\u201d he said, \u201cI have come to escort you to Ba Sing Se and help make sure you can peacefully,\u201d or not so peacefully, \u201cRetake your city.\u201d</p>\n<p>The King relaxed immediately. \u201cSo Aang sent you then! He said that it wasn\u2019t a trap, and I believed him of course, still it was very kind of him to send support. Be sure to tell him I said so!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kuei was smiling at him and Jeong Jeong suddenly felt very, very old.</p>\n<p>This boy- for he was truly a boy despite his actual age- this boy needed <em>so</em> much help. He was much too na\u00efve, much to trusting. If he kept going that way he\u2019d get himself killed.</p>\n<p>And Aang- telling the man it wasn\u2019t a trap- how foolish was the boy?</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong suddenly remembered the moment when he\u2019d refused the boy lessons and Roku had swept into Aang\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong still couldn\u2019t comprehend any possibly good that may have come from his lessons- the boy had apparently managed to burn down a fair number of Zhao\u2019s boats\u2026</p>\n<p>But that didn\u2019t explain anything. Not really. Why had the spirits wanted him to teach Aang Fire Bending?</p>\n<p>But Ozai was dead now- they were so close. And if Jeong Jeong had somehow contributed to that\u2026 well. If Aang- and through him Roku- thought this wasn\u2019t a trap\u2026 who was Jeong Jeong to declare that they were wrong?</p>\n<p>Piandao felt as though his heart was being split in two. The boy he\u2019d trained was in danger because of one of Piandao\u2019s best friends.</p>\n<p>What was he supposed to do?</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong- Piandao couldn\u2019t see him stopping his attempts on Zuko\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>And- though the first one had not been successful- who was to say that the next one would not be?</p>\n<p>And anyone could see how good Zuko was for the Fire Nation. The people loved him.</p>\n<p>Really, there was only one choice.</p>\n<p>\u201cIroh?\u201d Piandao said, \u201cPlease. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh forced himself to listen to Piandao and to read the entire letter Jeong Jeong had sent.</p>\n<p>He read and forced his fire to remain inside. It wanted to burst out- to destroy\u2026 something- preferably Jeong Jeong- how dare the man- how <em>dare</em> he harm Zuko?</p>\n<p>Iroh breathed. In, hold, out. And again.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong had tried to kill Zuko.</p>\n<p>And Iroh would not allow him to try again.</p>\n<p>He folded the note carefully. \u201cIt looks as though I am headed back to Ba Sing Se.\u201d Iroh said.</p>\n<p>The letter started smoking in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Azula still didn\u2019t understand the turtle ducks.</p>\n<p>She studied them carefully.</p>\n<p>Zuko thought that they were cute.</p>\n<p>The cook thought that they were good for cooking- though Zuko wouldn\u2019t allow them to be on the menu-</p>\n<p>Father had delighted in putting them on the menu- especially right after Mother had disappeared\u2026</p>\n<p>The turtle ducks ate old bread. But was that useful?</p>\n<p>Couldn\u2019t people just eat the bread when it was new?</p>\n<p>They kept the pool clean\u2026 that was probably helpful\u2026 Maybe?</p>\n<p>But what was the point of the pool?</p>\n<p>No one was actually able to drink out of it- because of the turtle ducks- maybe it watered the plants\u2026</p>\n<p>But what were the plants for? Shade?</p>\n<p><em>Fire is Life. </em>Azula remembered those words- felt as though they were branded into her mind- like Father\u2019s hand on Zuko\u2019s face. Those words\u2026 they obviously meant something to Zuko. He understood them- he <em>knew</em> them. But he couldn\u2019t explain it to her. When he tried\u2026 it generally just ended in a shouting match.</p>\n<p>Azula sighed.</p>\n<p>And then threw another piece of bread at the turtle ducks.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else I can do.\u201d Zuko said. He was sitting on the roof again with his head between his knees.</p>\n<p>Mai sat down next to him. She rested her hand against Zuko\u2019s neck and he felt himself relax slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAzula?\u201d Mai asked.</p>\n<p>Zuko nodded. \u201cHe fire was a lot better when fighting the assassin- but since then it has gone back to how it was before. And- trying to fight her doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not the same reaction. She\u2019s brilliant- she can work around her weakness and still win when she really probably shouldn\u2019t be able to- but that\u2019s not fixing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mai hummed thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting really tired of the turtle ducks,\u201d Zuko said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll start setting them on fire again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d Mai said softly.</p>\n<p>Zuko lifted his head finally, turning towards Mai.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Mai\u2019s lips quirked into her almost-smile. \u201cBecause she knows how much you love them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Kuei wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever expected to see Ba Sing Se again. He\u2019d only ever seen the city from the outside once. But seeing it again\u2026 he felt a lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>He was back. He was home.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong rode on his right and Kuei could see his eyes flicking from side to side. He was tense, as though expecting an attack.</p>\n<p>Kuei caught his eye. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He said, \u201cAang said so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong looked like he wasn\u2019t sure what to do with his face- it settled into an expression that was somewhat bemused.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong was a quiet person- but also an intense one.</p>\n<p>Kuei liked him.</p>\n<p>The gates opened for them, and the Fire Nation troops welcomed Kuei home.</p>\n<p>His people gathered on the streets, watching him with something like hope on their faces.</p>\n<p>Kuei had run- had left them. But now he was here. And he would never abandon them again.</p>\n<p>Aang glanced at Ty Lee. \u201cThis is a great idea.\u201d He said, and she nodded, grinning at him.</p>\n<p>Aang was the Avatar- which meant he really hadn\u2019t needed to pay for much. And the stuff they had paid for\u2026 well. Sokka and Katara had taken care of that. Or Toph.</p>\n<p>But this was a bet. Whoever won the most money by the end of the day- won.</p>\n<p>Aang grabbed Ty Lee and shoved up. Air came around them, under them, blasting them up and over the outer walls and into the main city.</p>\n<p>And then the <em>real</em> act began.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Aang watched as Ty Lee walked down the street on her hands, then flipped herself backwards onto her feet.</p>\n<p>People clapped. She was really amazing.</p>\n<p>But Aang still bet he could beat her. He went to a different quadrant of the city. Ty Lee had started her act with something amazing\u2026 he should too.</p>\n<p>Except- instead of cheering for him- people started screaming. And running away. Or attacking.</p>\n<p>Aang couldn\u2019t help but realize he wasn\u2019t earning any money at all.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Zuko was almost glad when the guards finally interrupted the meeting. It was important of course- soldiers and citizens both needed food- and figuring out where to get it from was necessary- but couldn\u2019t these people just get to the point?</p>\n<p>How many times did they have to say that they supported him taking down the war- or that they were so glad Uncle had been pardoned- or that they were just wondering when he would be back? And where had he gone anyways?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zuko asked, half standing.</p>\n<p>\u201cChaos!\u201d the guard said, \u201cOn the streets. The Avatar- the Avatar is out there- and he\u2019s- I don\u2019t even know but people are running- stampeding really and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>And that wasn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Katara gaped at Zuko for a long moment. \u201cAang accidentally started a riot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore like a panic- but yes. We need to get him out before we can get everyone calmed down. I don\u2019t really want to send the army in- that would probably get more people killed- but the Home guard- we\u2019re sending them in to put out the fires at least\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can help with that.\u201d Katara said and Zuko nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll find Aang,\u201d Sokka said, \u201cI\u2019ll take Appa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going with you,\u201d two voices said at exactly the same time, though in very different tones.</p>\n<p>Suki- and Azula. \u201cI\u2019m finding Ty Lee.\u201d Azula said, \u201cShe seems to have gone missing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka looked between the two of them, but he couldn\u2019t really refuse Azula.</p>\n<p>Katara watched him rub his head and almost felt sorry for him.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Aang had not meant for this to happen. Chasing after people and telling them he wasn\u2019t there to hurt them- and that they could stop running- made it worse.</p>\n<p>Standing in place didn\u2019t work either because someone always came to challenge him, to save the rest of everyone from him.</p>\n<p>They kept starting things on fire. And if Aang tried to put it out they\u2019d throw more fire at him- which wasn\u2019t good.</p>\n<p>Aang was nearly in tears by the time Sokka finally found him.</p>\n<p>They found Ty Lee a few minutes later- in a part of the city unaffected by the panic- making very good money on a street corner.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Azula could feel the fire- though not as brightly as she had before.</p>\n<p>It was power. She needed it- she needed to be good at it- to\u2026 to please Father.</p>\n<p>That\u2019d been her purpose for so long- to be his equal. His weapon. His tool. To do what he needed her to do- to earn his smiles and his praise and his time.</p>\n<p>And now he was gone.</p>\n<p>She looked at the fire once more. <em>Fire is life. </em>Zuko had said it- Zuko who never demanded anything of her. Who gave her time and advice and smiles free of charge.</p>\n<p>Who tried to protect her.</p>\n<p>And in that moment- she wanted to protect him.</p>\n<p>She wanted to protect Zuko.</p>\n<p>It was a strange thought- a strange feeling.</p>\n<p>She <em>wanted</em> to protect him.</p>\n<p>She felt her fire flare inside of her.</p>\n<p>She wanted to protect him. That meant protecting the things he loved. It meant protecting Mai and Iroh and his nation- and even his little turtle ducks.</p>\n<p>Her fire flared brighter and she could <em>feel</em> it again. It was\u2026 different than it had been before- but it seemed to more powerful for it. Azula grinned.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong had not expected this.</p>\n<p>Kuei sat on his throne. Jeong Jeong stood to the right of the throne. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly how it\u2019d happened but he\u2019d apparently been appointed as some sort of bodyguard.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong knew that the king\u2019s councilors couldn\u2019t be happy about it- he\u2019d seen them eyeing him- but in this Kuei stayed firm. He did not bend. Jeong Jeong was staying.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong hadn\u2019t thought of fire as a guard in\u2026 years. For so long fire had been a consuming force- something that devoured and destroyed and hurt.</p>\n<p>It was not, to him, a light in the darkness.</p>\n<p>But- that\u2019s what Kuei saw him as.</p>\n<p>And it was almost beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh requested an audience with the Earth King.</p>\n<p>He was told it\u2019d take two months.</p>\n<p>He replied that he was the Dragon of the West.</p>\n<p>He was let in a day later.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d had time to visit his tea shop. It was in good working condition\u2026 but he couldn\u2019t keep it. Zuko needed him more.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he would be able to come back\u2026 someday.</p>\n<p>The doors clicked shut behind Iroh.</p>\n<p>Iroh bowed to King Kuei, a slight bow, as one might do to an equal. \u201cKing Kuei,\u201d he said, \u201cI thank you for making time for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kuei nodded. \u201cJeong Jeong,\u201d Iroh said, \u201cYou tried to kill my nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong paled at that. \u201cYou did not know the whole truth of the situation.\u201d Iroh said, \u201cBut that is no excuse. He is sixteen. He is a child still, and you tried to kill him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see your point, I can understand your motivations, but Piandao agrees with me- Zuko is no threat.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo keep you from trying again, I promise that if Zuko is killed Azula will be appointed Fire Lord, not me. Also, should Zuko die while I still live and I find that death is in any way connected to you- I will hunt you to my dying breath. Are we understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kuei was gaping at him, mouth opening and closing while no sound emerged- but Iroh had eyes only for Jeong Jeong.</p>\n<p>Jeong Jeong nodded, once, and sharply. Iroh nodded back.</p>\n<p>Then he bowed again to the King, thanked him for his hospitality, and began the journey back to the Fire Nation.</p>\n<p>Iroh had to admit- he really loved war balloons.</p>\n<p>Azula made sure everything was perfect.</p>\n<p>She waited for the perfect time in a get-rid-of-the-war-meeting, declared that Zuko had fixed her fire, and promptly challenged him to an Agni Kai.</p>\n<p>He seemed rather surprised, though he accepted of course. How could he not?</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Iroh heard the murmurs as soon as he got back.</p>\n<p><em>Agni Kai,</em> they said. Agni Kai.</p>\n<p>And as he ran to the stadium, he prayed to all the spirits that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. He would not be too late again.</p>\n<p>\u2026---\u2026</p>\n<p>Zuko had really been hoping that Azula would get over this. But she\u2019d challenged him to an Agni Kai, just as she\u2019d promised she would. He couldn\u2019t really fault her on that.</p>\n<p>He knelt on his side of the field, and she knelt on hers. At the signal, he stood, turning.</p>\n<p>But she didn\u2019t attack. Zuko blinked as Azula smiled at him, and then she knelt.</p>\n<p>Zuko had been ready to fight, but as Azula knelt he lowered his arms. He glanced around, seeing if he could figure out who she was kneeling too.</p>\n<p>\u201cAzula?\u201d he asked, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>The stands, which had been loud and demanding moments ago were silent as a grave now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI surrender,\u201d Azula said, \u201cI hear that this is the way to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko wasn\u2019t quite sure if she was mocking him or not. That day was probably his worst memory ever- that or the day his mother had left\u2026 And calling his mind back to it was\u2026 cruel.</p>\n<p>Then again- she wasn\u2019t fighting him. And this was Azula. She was probably trying to be nice.</p>\n<p>Zuko coughed. \u201cI accept your surrender then,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>He wondered why she\u2019d challenged him, if only to give in moment later.</p>\n<p>He walked over to her, and held out a hand. She took it and stood.</p>\n<p>In the stands there was silence a moment longer. Then Uncle began clapping. Aang, Toph, Sokka and Katara joined in soon after, then the entire stadium was clapping.</p>\n<p>Azula smiled at him. \u201cAnd now they all know how much better you are than Ozai,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Zuko still would have preferred not to go through the anxiety of not knowing- of thinking he\u2019d have to fight her\u2026 but watching the cheering crowd he thought, <em>This works too. </em></p>"
