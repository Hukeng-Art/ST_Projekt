  "text": "<p>\n<strong>Operation MFwDM: Briefing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There were many things that Harry was known to be good at.</p>\n<p>For one thing, he was made to fly. Between his slight stature and his quick reaction time, he often felt more natural in the skies than on land. He sometimes fancied himself to have been a peregrine falcon in a past life: not terribly impressive in size or appearance, but quick and agile. The skies were his domain.</p>\n<p>For another thing, he\u2019d remained the top student in DADA six years running; this \"eighth\" year looked like it would be no different. When it came to topics he cared about, not even Hermione could beat him. His generally average marks weren\u2019t an indicator of his intelligence, really; they were an indicator of how much he gave a damn about the subject.</p>\n<p>Additionally, he could bring people together in a way normally only done by martyrs and evil dictators, in spite of his easygoing temperament and unintimidating image and tendency to skulk about alone at night (much to Hermione's chagrin, but what else was he supposed to do when she and Ron insisted on such mundane hobbies as <em>sleeping</em>?).</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t entirely understand how or why, but he walked and people followed.</p>\n<p>Then there were the <em>other</em> things Harry was good at \u2013 things people did not know. Or, things that even the ones who knew pretended they didn\u2019t. Things that made Hermione fret uncomfortably even when she knew he was right, things that confused Ron no matter how much he tried to explain, things that had ultimately ended his stint with Ginny very quickly.</p>\n<p>For instance, Harry was very good at obsessing. Very, <em>very</em> good at obsessing. In fact, he considered himself something of an expert in obsession. He could try to laugh it off or dismiss it as dedication, but it went beyond that. He <em>obsessed</em>, and he knew it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d obsessed over the prophecy of being the one to kill Voldemort. He\u2019d obsessed over Quidditch. He\u2019d obsessed over competing with Malfoy. He\u2019d obsessed over hating Snape. He\u2019d obsessed over stalking Ginny when she was dating other boys and his hormones were kicking in for the first time since that disastrous nonsense with Cho.</p>\n<p>(It might not have been so bad with Ginny had he realised sooner that obsession and romantic affection were two very different things. Then again, he wouldn\u2019t have realised it at all had Ginny not sat him down for a good, long bollocking about the ways in which he was a pretty shite boyfriend. Not wanting to go any further than snogging ranked high on that list, as did his tendency to demand her attention when he wanted it but forgetting about her when he had something else to fixate on. She\u2019d accused him of being gay, and \u2013 oh.)</p>\n<p>(<em>Ohhhh.</em>)</p>\n<p>He\u2019d obsessed every time he returned to Hogwarts and something strange and new happened to him. The normal reaction of a small child being stalked through the corridors by whispers in the walls, for instance, would be terror (or at the very least questioning his sanity). The normal course of action would be to report the happenings to a figure of authority.</p>\n<p>Harry was the small child who would go running after the whispers by himself in the dead of night instead of running <em>away</em> from them.</p>\n<p>(<em>Oops.</em>)</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t that he was immune to fear, not at all. It was simply that once a concept got into his brain, it looped over and over and over again, as if on repeat. It didn\u2019t always occur to him to report the obsession to others, and even when he did, the responses he got were generally unfavourable (read: Hermione would fret or chide him, Dumbledore would not tell him anything useful, most everyone else would wonder if he was turning into the next Dark Lord). This meant he was generally on his own, obsessing in private until things got far out of hand.</p>\n<p>He still didn\u2019t see this as a bad thing.</p>\n<p>Harry was also very good at manipulating. Much as he\u2019d hated the way the Sorting Hat had waffled on his house when he\u2019d first come to Hogwarts, he could see now exactly why it had considered Slytherin for him: he <em>was</em> driven and ambitious, he <em>was</em> sneaky when he wanted to be, he <em>did</em> take advantage of the fact that he could read people well enough to trick them into doing what he wanted.</p>\n<p>He knew when to go to Hermione for help and when to keep his mouth shut. He knew how to play Ron. He knew how far he could push people before they pushed back.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t see this as a bad thing, either. It was all in their best interests, after all.</p>\n<p>In short, what this all boiled down to was that Harry was pretty all right at getting what he wanted, especially when it took obsession and manipulation to get it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u201dAnyone sitting here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco Malfoy barely had time to look up before Harry slid into the seat, bookbag dropping to the floor with a heavy <em>thunk</em> as he smiled.</p>\n<p>Malfoy \u2013 <em>Draco</em>, Harry amended in his head; if this was going to work, getting on a first name basis would really be the first step \u2013 <em>Draco</em> frowned at him in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Smile faltering (just a little) ((he didn\u2019t want to overdo it, after all)), Harry stood halfway up again.</p>\n<p>As he did, some distracted part of him noticed that Mal \u2013 <em>Draco</em> seemed longer and lankier than usual. Given their respective levels of elevation, the difference in height was not what Harry would have expected based on past experiences. Judging by the way the cool, collected young man\u2019s legs fidgeted a bit under the table as he tried in vain to get them comfortable, Harry had the feeling he wasn\u2019t used to his own height yet, either.</p>\n<p>Despite no longer wishing Draco ill, Harry was oddly delighted at the little fidget. It was adorably charming to see him put off by something as mundane as a growth spurt.</p>\n<p>Reining his thoughts in as he reminded himself of the mission at hand, he continued in an embarrassed, contrite tone. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to take \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d <em>Draco</em> corrected hastily, shaking his head. \u201cI mean, nobody\u2019s sitting there, but why would you \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, brilliant!\u201d Harry interrupted, dropping back down again with a pleased smile and busying himself with taking out his class supplies. He pretended not to notice the way the other students stared at him (as if that were anything new). He also pretended not to notice the way Draco leaned away from him warily (which <em>was</em> new, but he couldn\u2019t really blame him).</p>\n<p>He <em>also</em> pretended not to notice that his head only seemed to come up to the blond\u2019s shoulder. Seated directly beside him like this, the growth spurt seemed flat-out ridiculous. Rather than jealous, however, Harry felt tiny next to him \u2013 and why was that so pleasing? Strange. He would have to consult with Hermione later \u2013 except oh, <em>no</em>, he wouldn\u2019t, and that was precisely why he was sitting here now.</p>\n<p>Two tables over, there was one pair of students too lost in their own world to notice the unusual seating arrangement. Hermione's long hair fell over her face as she ducked, rosy-cheeked and giggling and overall acting far more girly than Harry had never known her to act; beside her, Ron beamed at making her laugh.</p>\n<p>Harry knew this without having to look at them. It was how they\u2019d been spending every waking moment since they\u2019d gotten together. Breakfast? Teasing, giggles, and smiles. Lunch? Teasing, giggles, and smiles. One of them returning from a quick trip to the loo? Teasing, giggles, and smiles.</p>\n<p>He was happy for them, really. They were his best mates, and this had been a long time coming. In fact, he was so happy for them that he was glad to give them space to enjoy their relationship. Lots of space. From across the room. Or possibly in another room altogether so he couldn\u2019t hear or see them forgetting themselves and snogging in front of him.</p>\n<p>Again.</p>\n<p>\"So, how are you?\" he asked Draco cheerfully as though they did this all the time. \"Merlin, but this summer was a mess. It's good to see you back here, though. How's your mum?\"</p>\n<p>Wary look transforming into an irritated scowl, Draco opened his mouth to tell Harry off for being strange when he stopped. His head didn't move, but his eyes darted sideways as if feeling the burn of a thousand (or at least two dozen) glares. Weary look settling back in again, he turned away to twirl his quill around in a nervous fidget, staring down at the blank parchment before him. \"She's well, thank you.\"</p>\n<p>Well, that was\u2026 something.</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t blame him for shutting down, really. Their peers could be a little\u2026 disturbing. The same students who glared daggers at Draco had a bothersome tendency to trail Harry through the halls these days. Some degree of creepy adulation was not uncommon; Harry was not the only experienced stalker in the school, and Romilda Vane was by no means the only one to resort to unscrupulous methods over the years whilst trying to pull him. Still, it was getting pretty ridiculous.</p>\n<p>(He\u2019d already \u201clost\u201d three quills and a textbook since the start of school, and the number of owls he received every morning had tripled. He\u2019d taken to automatically burning any bulky pink envelopes without opening, as they had a disturbingly high rate of containing women\u2019s panties. There were also a pair of socks currently on auction amongst the lower years as the ones he\u2019d worn during the final battle, and the present going rate was twelve galleons and six sickles. The funny part was, they weren\u2019t even his; he\u2019d never owned green socks in his life.) ((The comb that had sold last week for seventeen galleons, on the other hand, <em>had been</em> his; there was now a stronger locking charm on his trunk.))</p>\n<p>In short, their classmates had quite lost their heads and Harry didn\u2019t really want to deal with the general population any more than Draco probably did.</p>\n<p>Before Harry could respond, McGonagall swept in and the class fell silent. Sparing them all only a glance, she began the lesson.</p>\n<p>Harry sighed in a combination of disappointment and relief. The disappointment was because he hadn\u2019t simply been taking the piss or hiding from the deliriously happy couple his friends made; he really <em>had</em> meant to check in on the lone \"eighth year\" Slytherin and try to make friends. Bygones and fresh starts and all that.</p>\n<p>The relief was because fresh starts were still pretty fucking awkward. Especially with someone with whom he shared such a tumultuous past.</p>\n<p>What it really boiled down to was that Harry was just <em>tired</em> of the rivalry. He was 18 and had just finished a long, drawn-out, seven-year war that had been a frustrating combination of Hurry-Up-and-Wait and Oh-My-<em>God</em>-We\u2019re-Going-to-Die. He was tired of constantly watching his back. He was tired of being in a never ending one-up contest. He was tired of matching glare for glare and scathing remark for scathing remark.</p>\n<p>He suspected Draco was as well.</p>\n<p>Since returning to Hogwarts two weeks prior, Draco didn't seem to be talking to anyone. He kept his head down, slipped through side corridors to avoid the crowds, and generally behaved like a kicked puppy. Given his added height, he wasn\u2019t succeeding very well at remaining under the radar, and it only served to make Harry ache in sympathy at the sight. While Harry couldn\u2019t necessarily say he was actively <em>fond</em> of the prat, they had six years of mutual antagonism under their belts, so he liked to think he knew Draco quite well.</p>\n<p>He even had the repository to prove it. This repository was spread across old homework assignments, napkins, books, the inside edge of one of his pillowcases, and all over his brain.</p>\n<p>Fact #14: Draco Malfoy was a people person. While he worked independently in terms of\u2026 well, <em>work</em>, he was otherwise always surrounded by people. He thrived on attention.</p>\n<p>Fact #9: Draco Malfoy was a loud person. He had the sort of voice that could cut across the Great Hall, and had he been less of a prat, he could have made a pretty decent leader. He was good at projecting, and even better at bossing people around.</p>\n<p>Fact #429: Draco Malfoy was a positive person. That was strange to think about, but Harry really couldn\u2019t recall seeing him ever act depressed (well, except for that beastly ordeal in sixth year, understandably). With his cockiness and house popularity came an automatic assumption that he was always right and things would always go well for him.</p>\n<p>But now he was alone, silent, and subdued.</p>\n<p>And now, Harry\u2019s Draco Lucius Abraxas Malfoy Repository of Information Collected Whilst Stalking (DLAMRoICWS) was facing a glaring discrepancy between the contents of that repository and the young man beside him and blaring a code red.</p>\n<p>(Amongst the things Harry <em>wasn\u2019t</em> good at \u2013 a list which included being an adequate boyfriend, as Ginny could attest to \u2013 was letting things go.)</p>\n<p>((He could already feel the obsession settling in again.))</p>\n<p>He also thought they could really use each other at this point. Draco really needed to get out more and have a friend, and Harry needed someone who simply Got It. Got the war, got the desire to hide from the well-meaning crowds, got the fact that he was more a boy than a hero and didn\u2019t give a damn about his fame. Got, even, that Hermione and Ron were a bit much, and going from a trio to one was not a pleasant experience.</p>\n<p>(Obviously, their circumstances were quite a bit different in the details, and it wasn\u2019t something Harry would be bringing up.)</p>\n<p>((He wondered if Draco was still in touch with Goyle or Zabini or Nott. Merlin, was he even still in touch with <em>Parkinson</em>?))</p>\n<p>Even if their mutual understanding had come about through years of hostility, it was still there now \u2013 and hopefully the antagonism wouldn\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>None of these thoughts were new.</p>\n<p>Well, they were new in the grand scheme of things, perhaps, but he\u2019d thought them through all summer as he read article after article on how the Malfoys were faring after the war. Taking in the quiet comments from the young heir and how resigned he looked in his photos, Harry <s>obsessed</s> observed from a distance, quietly considering his options and what the best course of action would be. He\u2019d hoped Draco would get better once school began and he was surrounded by familiar peers, but even as he hoped, Harry knew better.</p>\n<p>And thus, Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy was born.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>At dinner, Harry begged off on joining his friends in the Great Hall. Citing a headache, he headed off in the general direction of the hospital wing until Hermione and Ron vanished \u2013 then changed course and went to the kitchens. There, he chatted with the house elves a bit, confiscated Winky\u2019s butterbeer, and politely asked for a sandwich and maybe some pumpkin juice to take outside.</p>\n<p>The picnic basket they gave him had him leaning heavily to one side to compensate for its weight. Oh, well \u2013 he certainly wasn\u2019t one to turn down free food.</p>\n<p>It took about fifteen minutes to find Draco, and most of that time was spent resting and shaking out his arm. Running, camping, and hiding didn\u2019t give him quite the same workout Quidditch had, and he was suffering for it now. By the time he made it to the greenhouse where the blond had taken to spending several evenings a week, he was sweating slightly.</p>\n<p>It was possible that Hermione\u2019s bag with its Extension Charm had spoiled him just a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cLovely night for a picnic,\u201d he remarked as he dropped the basket onto the bench beside the lone Slytherin, smiling apologetically when he jumped. \u201cSorry about that. I thought you\u2019d heard me come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave him the puzzled, wary frown again. \u201cPeople come and go. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to approach me, much less <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t much, but Harry could hear just a little of the old Draco Malfoy sneer. In another life, with another set of priorities, the tone would have grated at his nerves; now, however, he was simply relieved. Maybe he wasn\u2019t too far gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t exactly expect you, either,\u201d Harry lied cheerfully, settling on the bench with the basket between them. \u201cBut there you are, and here I am, and the elves were a bit over-eager in packing. Help a bloke out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco narrowed his eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to poison me, there are more elegant ways to do it than some ridiculous picnic scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d probably end up blessing you instead, or poisoning myself on the fumes,\u201d Harry retorted with a snort. (Fact #108: Draco Malfoy loved it when Harry was bad at something.) \u201cYou know how I am at brewing. Go on, then \u2013 I nearly tore my arm off carrying this thing. We may as well enjoy it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s suspicion didn\u2019t lessen, but when he opened his mouth he simply shut it again without protest. A look of exhaustion flashed across his face, and he turned away with a sigh. \u201cWhy are you even out here? Shouldn\u2019t you be celebrating with your minions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not minions,\u201d Harry responded with an eyeroll.</p>\n<p>Draco snorted in response. Harry smiled.</p>\n<p>Pulling out a sandwich and fussing with the wrapping, he continued. \u201cWell, not most of them, anyway. I suppose a few of them have been acting a bit minionly, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll pass in a few weeks if I ignore it. It\u2019s pretty awkward to go to brush my teeth and have Seamus hand me my toothbrush, or come back to Neville fluffing my pillow.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look Draco gave him clearly said he thought Harry was exaggerating.</p>\n<p>(If only.)</p>\n<p>They settled into a silence disrupted only by the sounds of Harry chewing and a choir of crickats chirping outside. (They were sounding better this week, Harry mused. Two had missed practise the last time he was out here, but now they were mewing almost in sync.)</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Draco sighed and reached into the basket. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a very smooth deflection, Potter,\u201d he drawled, picking at the contents before pulling out a bowl of steak and kidney pie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry asked unhelpfully, smiling as he watched Draco conjure a fork as if it were second nature. \u201cMaybe I just wanted fresh air.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco paused in his bite to give him a Look. \u201cWe\u2019re inside a greenhouse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I got the fresh air on the way to the greenhouse, and am ready to be indoors again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dropping his fork into his bowl and setting both on the bench, Draco stood to leave. Harry hastily reached out to grab his sleeve, grabbing it again when he got promptly shaken off. \u201cHey, wait \u2013 I\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat exactly are you trying to do?\u201d Draco demanded. \u201cWhy are you sitting next to me, why are you calling me by name, why are you <em>out here</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Squishing down the little cheer of triumph in his throat at the familiarly imperious tone, Harry gave him a sheepish smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything to do with you, really,\u201d he replied. \u201cI just\u2026 it\u2019s all noise in there. Too many people, too much staring. Hermione and Ron have been all over each other since the summer \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Draco graced him with a constipated look at that mental image.</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2013 and I can\u2019t get any privacy anywhere else, not even my room. You\u2019re...\u201d Hesitating just long enough to express vulnerability (Fact #23: Draco Malfoy was drawn to weakness like a shark to blood) but not long enough to increase his irritation, Harry shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t really care about me, and the students who came back don\u2019t really care about you. And we\u2019ve never really been about the war, have we \u2013 the two of us? So it\u2019s quiet here.\u201d</p>\n<p>This part was a gamble. There was nothing in his DLAMRoICWS that said Draco was a sympathetic person (well, except for Fact #243: Draco Malfoy didn\u2019t have the stomach for true violence \u2013 see exception 14B, The Nose Incident). Harry was relying partially on Draco\u2019s attraction to vulnerability and partially (largely) on his recent reticence to obtain his passive compliance.</p>\n<p>Draco scrutinised him.</p>\n<p>Never one to be intimidated by scrutiny, Harry stared back.</p>\n<p>The crickats purred.</p>\n<p>Draco sighed and sat back down. \u201cJust stop babbling at me. You sound like an idiot,\u201d he grumbled, picking up his pie again and biting into it crabbily.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>In the end, Harry decided he could definitely consider the picnic a success. They admittedly hadn't made much headway in terms of positive communication (and in fact, stopped speaking almost entirely for the rest of the evening), but he thought they\u2019d come to an adequate understanding. Plus, they'd successfully had dinner together (+suspicion) (-aggression) and it was only stage one of his project implementation.</p>\n<p>Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy had officially begun.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>The next time he approached Draco was in the blond's territory. He knew that Draco haunted the library fairly often these days, sticking to unpopular areas like Wizarding History, but today he was surprised to locate him in the culinary section. Well, he could work with that.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Draco,\" he greeted after stepping into the aisle and affecting a look of surprise at spotting him seated at a table midway down. \"Taking up a new hobby?\"</p>\n<p>Sitting up straight from where he was uncharacteristically hunched over, Draco frowned at him at the name, then frowned more deeply at the question. \u201cA hob\u2013 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gestured at the shelf just above his head. Draco followed the movement until his eyes took in the spines of the books around him: <em>Making Magic in Your Kitchen</em>, <em>Puree Your Pain Away</em>, <em>Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble: Cooking for Beginners</em>, <em>Peter Piper\u2019s Peck of Peculiarly Potente Pickled Peppers</em>, and <em>Fabulous French Fricassee</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry took the opportunity of his distraction to sneak a glimpse of the spine of the book that was actually occupying the blond\u2019s attention. He didn\u2019t recognise it, but that wasn\u2019t very surprising; he wasn\u2019t much of a reader unless it pertained to one of his obsessions. What <em>was</em> surprising was how not-magical it sounded. Draco had always been particularly vocal about his disinterest in topics not pertaining to magic, money, or Quidditch. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, a law text? Are you planning to join the Ministry?\u201d he asked curiously.</p>\n<p>Looking back over at Harry, Draco frowned for a moment before suddenly looking embarrassed. He shut his book hurriedly and slid it off the table to be hidden on his lap. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he replied with a scowl. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aha! Harry added this to the DLAMRoICWS as Fact #478. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked to read!\u201d he exclaimed cheerfully, flinching when one of the books to his right hushed him. Shooting it an apologetic look, he quickly settled down into the seat across from Draco\u2019s. \u201cTell me about it?\u201d (Fact #299: Draco Malfoy liked showing off his knowledge.)</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d came the automatic response. \u201cFind your own copy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I know I\u2019ll want to read it if I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about?\u201d Harry reasoned. Leaning over the table, he made a playful grab for the book and only noticed that he was essentially swiping at the Slytherin\u2019s lap when Draco jerked back, pink-cheeked and indignant at the invasion of space. \u201cCome on, tell me about it! It can\u2019t be that boring if you\u2019re reading it in your free time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Swatting at Harry\u2019s hands, the blond scowled. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t interest you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I kn\u2013 \u201d Cutting himself off from what Harry strongly suspected was an incriminatingly familiar <em>know you</em>, Draco shot him a distinctly disgruntled look. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think mad, self-destructive, Russian murderers are really your type, even if you may share a sometimes similar sense of self-righteous arrogance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not having expected such a heavy subject matter, Harry blinked. \u201cMerlin. Are you <em>sure</em> you\u2019re not meant to be friends with \u2018Mione? Because really, both your ideas of recreational reading are a little\u2026 intense.\u201d He made another grab for the book nonetheless and laughed when Draco lifted it just long enough to smack the side of his head with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are <em>you</em> doing here?\u201d Draco demanded as he swung the book out of reach again. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though there\u2019s anywhere for you to cook at Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry ignored the victory cheers going off in his head to settle back in his seat with affected resignation. Rubbing his head where he\u2019d been hit, he slipped a random book off the shelves to flip through idly. \u201cAh, no. I mean, I know the basics of how to cook in a Muggle kitchen, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d call a hobby. I was just\u2026\u201d Letting his voice trail off for a moment, he glanced up (and up, and <em>up</em>) at Draco before returning his gaze to the book cover and shrugging. \u201cI was looking for somewhere to hide for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t nattering at me defeat the purpose of hiding?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cMaybe, but it\u2019s still more fun.\u201d Ignoring the look Draco gave him \u2013 this one more along the lines of <em>Are you brain-damaged?</em> \u2013 he shrugged. \u201cI can deal with maybe one or two people I actually personally know. But Ron and Hermione are busy, so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive me for not actually <em>caring</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s grin returned. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to care. I told you \u2013 it\u2019s a relief. It\u2019s pretty liberating.\u201d</p>\n<p>The book hushed him again.</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cYou also said you appreciated the quiet, but you\u2019re certainly not living up to the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lowering his book, Harry leaned over it to stare at Draco seriously. \u201cIf I shut up while we\u2019re in the library, will you <em>please</em> just accept my words at face value? If I say I don\u2019t expect you to care, I don\u2019t expect you to care. Only I don\u2019t want kids I barely know coming up to me when I\u2019m alone and making awkward small talk. And I don\u2019t think you really want kids <em>you</em> barely know standing close to you and making passive-aggressive comments, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Because maybe he was sort of blind, but he definitely wasn\u2019t <em>deaf</em> \u2013 and neither was Draco.)</p>\n<p>((And because fact #313: Draco Malfoy liked bargaining. Whether it was because he was a Slytherin or whether it was because he was his father\u2019s son, he worked well in trading favours, secrets, material possessions, and/or services. Case in point: Crabbe and Goyle had protected him from his enemies, and he\u2019d kept them from flunking out of school and gave them focus for their aggression.))</p>\n<p>Although Draco was clearly wary, he finally relented after staring suspiciously at Harry for a good, long minute.</p>\n<p>Well, \u201crelented\u201d was euphemistic: he seemed to deflate, losing interest in the argument as his shoulders slumped down in resignation. \u201cFine,\u201d he sighed, opening up his book again. \u201cI don\u2019t entirely believe you, and I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being so damn persistent about this, but if it keeps you from being such a bother, do as you please. Just do it <em>quietly</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>A bit worried about the clear weariness in the other boy but relieved nonetheless, Harry nodded, settled back in his chair, and picked up his book again.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Like the picnic, Harry decided to count this as a success. They remained together for about two hours, Draco stubbornly ignoring Harry and Harry keeping to his promise of quiet company. He could tell when Draco started getting bored and fidgety, but as the blond was too stubborn to start up a chat, Harry pretended not to notice. Eventually, Draco marked his place and shut his novel before getting to his feet to leave (after knocking his knees against the belly of the table and swearing; Harry had to bite his cheek to stifle a smile). A soft \u201cGood night, Draco\u201d earned him a strange look, but as the Slytherin didn\u2019t actually argue or tell him to stop, he decided that was as much permission as any.</p>\n<p>Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy was well under way.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>After that, Harry found that it was surprisingly easy to get Draco out and about. Well \u2013 not as easy as Ron or Hermione, perhaps, as it still took some wheedling, but he soon found himself no longer worrying about getting rejected or needing to set up picnic schemes.</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t to say he didn\u2019t still do some plotting, of course.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in Merlin\u2019s name is around your neck, Potter?\u201d (Because it was still always \u201cPotter\u201d from Draco.)</p>\n<p>Harry blinked up (and up, and <em>up</em>) at Draco with perfect innocence. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they were called scarves the last I checked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stared disdainfully at his frizzy, orange/puce/mauve-mottled scarf. \u201cAnd did you kill it yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked down at the ragged ends of his scarf in absent curiosity and tugged at a loose thread. It quickly became apparent that said loose thread was actually one end of the design as it began to unravel. \u201cI dunno. It\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve got besides my house scarf,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about fashion, and Hermione\u2019s been too busy to drag me shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ugh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next Hogsmeade weekend found Harry dragging Draco to Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop to restock on parchment and ink for class, \u201cjust for a moment, and then we can head back.\u201d Of course, now that they were out <em>anyway</em>, and since Harry was still wearing <em>the scarf</em>, there was no reason for Draco not to force Harry into one of the clothing shops he\u2019d frequented before the war.</p>\n<p>Opening the door, he hesitated in the entryway as if expecting to get kicked out (and indeed, the shopkeeper seemed to consider it as she glared at him warily), but Harry ducking under his arm and tugging on his sleeve until he followed seemed to appease everyone. With the responsibility of his unspoken crime of trespassing relinquished to the Saviour of the Wizarding World, Draco seemed to relax as he steered Harry over to the winter section and tossed a few scarves at him.</p>\n<p>Harry stared bemusedly at the scarves before tentatively placing one around his neck and wrapping it around once. He looked up (and up, and <em>up</em>) at Draco with wide, hopeful, and deceptively guileless eyes and allowed himself a small smile when the blond huffed in exasperation and adjusted it. (Fact #299 again.)</p>\n<p>This process was repeated four more times until Draco decided on two of them. On the way to the counter, Draco directed them to the winter coats as well and made Harry model half a dozen of those, then added a grey woollen one to their purchase pile. Some dragonhide gloves were thrown on top, and then they were off.</p>\n<p>When they left, the shopkeeper\u2019s suspicious stare was for another reason entirely.</p>\n<p>Shopping turned into lunch at the Hog\u2019s Head when Harry\u2019s stomach began growling and even Draco could confess to an appetite. Lunch turned into cauldron cakes from Honeydukes because it wasn\u2019t a meal without something sweet for dessert, and then cauldron cakes turned into drinks because they were a little <em>too</em> sweet. Drinks turned into an argument about the merits of tea versus coffee (Draco, of course, considering the latter utterly plebian whereas Harry swore by it), which turned into staying at a cafe long enough to sample a selection. (Fact #480 became <em>Draco Malfoy favoured tea, particularly hojicha and Earl Grey</em>.)</p>\n<p>By the time they waddled back to the castle, bellies full and Harry bedecked in new winter attire after Draco insisted he couldn\u2019t stand the eyesore of Dudley\u2019s old rags any longer, the proud Slytherin had all but given up the pretense of reluctance.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>After a month and a half of Hogsmeade trips and library visits and impromptu dinners, it only seemed natural for one of them to follow the other home.</p>\n<p>Draco didn\u2019t say anything as Harry trailed after him after class. He continued to not say anything as Harry followed him down to the dungeons. Even as he spoke the password to the Slytherin commons, he didn\u2019t bother to try and conceal it. When he slipped through the door and Harry entered as well, however, he finally gave him another one of those early Looks \u2013 as did the other Slytherins seated inside.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What\u2019s Potter doing in here?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Is he with </em>Malfoy<em>?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Are they about to fight?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I wonder if Malfoy\u2019s got him Imperiused\u2026</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Didn\u2019t you hear? Potter can throw off the Imperius!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Maybe Potter\u2019s got</em> Malfoy <em>Imperiused\u2026</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Or maybe they\u2019re</em> \u2013 you know!\u201d</p>\n<p>Long accustomed to people whispering around him, Harry ignored them to follow Draco to his room.</p>\n<p>Once they got there, Draco turned at the door to frown at him. \u201cExactly how far are you planning to follow me?\u201d he asked mildly, although it seemed more exasperated than anything else.</p>\n<p>Grinning, Harry shrugged one shoulder. \u201cWhat makes you think I have a plan?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a plan of some sort since you started pestering me,\u201d Draco drawled. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly subtle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Actually a little offended this time, Harry was only slightly appeased by Draco letting him into the room. \u201cWhat? I can be subtle!\u201d he protested indignantly. Stalking after him, he dumped his bookbag on the same bed Draco did. \u201cI can! We had to sneak around all the time last year!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and you\u2019re excellent at sneaking around the castle, too. But when I can actually <em>see</em> you, you\u2019re not subtle,\u201d Draco shot back as he headed over to a wardrobe \u2013 a <em>wardrobe</em>; the Slytherins each had personal <em>wardrobes</em>? \u2013 and hung his house robe up. \u201cYou get this look in your eye like you\u2019re up to something, and the corner of your mouth twitches like you\u2019re trying not to smile.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alarmed by that news and more than a little embarrassed (and also a little pleased that Draco had noticed) ((or maybe a <em>lot</em> pleased)), Harry frowned as he removed his robe and handed it over to Draco\u2019s outstretched hand to be hung. \u201cNobody <em>else</em> notices. Hermione, for one, would have said something.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least his ability to obsess wasn\u2019t being challenged. Still, it rankled that maybe he wasn\u2019t quite as manipulative as he\u2019d thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t had as much reason to look for signs that you\u2019re tricking her, has she?\u201d Draco pointed out as he shut the door and dropped onto his chair (because each Slytherin also had a <em>chair</em> with a personal <em>writing desk</em>, and how was this in any way fair?). \u201cI\u2019ve been trying all month to figure out what you\u2019re after, but I don\u2019t have any social status to offer you anymore and that nonsense about sitting with me so that other people leaving you alone was a thin excuse. Even the people complaining about me have quieted down by now, yet here you are. The only answers I come up with don\u2019t make any <em>sense</em>, like that you \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust want to be friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2013 just want to be friends.\u201d Draco stared at him in disgruntled disbelief.</p>\n<p>Harry smiled brightly back.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, that wasn\u2019t really the whole story \u2013 not anymore. If there was anything Harry had figured out while dragging Draco around like a puppet, it was that he apparently liked the blond\u2019s company quite a bit. What had started off as sympathy and goodwill and a desire to make up for their long years of petty rivalry was quickly becoming an actual desire for friendship \u2013 </p>\n<p> \u2013 and okay, maybe a little bit more.</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t exactly want Draco to know <em>that</em>.</p>\n<p>Turning away from him, Draco scowled and pointedly began pulling out his lesson books. \u201cWhatever it is you\u2019re <em>really</em> up to, I <em>will</em> find out,\u201d he warned.</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s <em>pants</em>.</p>\n<p>Sighing, Harry dropped onto the Slytherin\u2019s bed. \u201cYou do that,\u201d he replied, \u201cand let me know when you do, yeah? So I know what I\u2019m supposedly up to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco wordlessly turned a page in his Ancient Runes text.</p>\n<p>Taking the silence as assent \u2013 because he wasn\u2019t just being self-serving here; with Draco Malfoy silence really <em>did</em> seem to be assent \u2013 Harry smiled to himself and settled in to wait until Draco got bored of studying. He could be patient. He\u2019d out-stubborned him at the library several times.</p>\n<p>And Merlin, but the Slytherins had such comfortable (<em>unfairly</em> comfortable) beds.</p>\n<p>And the pillow smelled quite nice...</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>The next thing Harry knew, he was being smothered with another equally nice-smelling pillow.</p>\n<p>Flailing and choking, he managed to twist to his side until the pillow left his face and he could stare up (and up, and <em>up</em>) at Draco with wide, startled eyes.</p>\n<p>The apparently homicidal Slytherin stared down at him with an unimpressed look. \u201cWere you ever planning to go away, or have you moved in now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t just say \u2018Wake up\u2019 or something like a normal person?\u201d Harry rasped as he sat up and adjusted his glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get you up for nearly ten <em>minutes</em>, Potter. You sleep like the damn dead.\u201d Draco crossed his arms. \u201cCase in point, you\u2019ve been napping for the last four <em>hours</em>, and I\u2019d like to sleep now.\u201d</p>\n<p>That announcement startled Harry further awake. \u201cFour hours?\u201d he echoed. That meant it was, what\u2026 eleven? Midnight? Groaning, he dropped back down and covered his head with a pillow. \u201cIt\u2019s not even worth going back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it <em>is</em>, because you\u2019re hogging <em>my</em> bed,\u201d Draco scowled, yanking the pillow off and swatting him with it. \u201cGet moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the corridors are <em>cold</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a robe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA robe doesn\u2019t stop the draughts!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, Draco rubbed his nose before stalking over to his wardrobe. Flinging it open, he pulled out Harry\u2019s Gryffindor robe and tossed it at him. It was followed up with one of his own house scarves. <em>This</em> was followed up with a snug, green hat and a matching pair of gloves.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny other complaints?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry decided not to push his luck. For now. \u201cIt\u2019ll do,\u201d he told Draco with a shameless grin, pulling on every one of the pieces. Bidding Draco good night, he headed back to Gryffindor tower.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>When Harry slipped into his own room, his housemates took one look at his scarves and hat and gloves, rolled their eyes, and went back to bed.</p>\n<p>Harry wondered how long it would take for Draco to miss his accoutrements.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>It took four days.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>It took three more for Harry to actually return any of it.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy was maybe getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>Harry realised this when Hermione came up to him one day, four months since the start of his project, and informed him, \u201cHarry, this is maybe getting out of hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked at her, in part surprised that she\u2019d detached herself from Ron long enough to come after him. \u201cWhat is?\u201d he asked innocently.</p>\n<p>Hermione rolled her eyes. \u201cYou know perfectly well what I\u2019m talking about, Harry. You\u2019ve got that look in your eye, and your mouth is twitching.\u201d</p>\n<p>(<em>What?!</em>)</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd besides, aside from questioning your tastes, I don\u2019t really care that you\u2019re dating Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat up, alarmed. \u201cNow, wait a minute! I\u2019m not \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised, really. We all heard your testimony at the trials, and that was still nothing compared to the way you used to stalk him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 I had good reason to \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd even I can admit that he\u2019s much more tolerable these days, now that he\u2019s not spouting all that blood purity rubbish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes, but I don\u2019t see how that has \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think he deserves a little more honesty?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Harry was <em>actually</em> confused. \u201cHonesty? About what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione huffed. \u201cHarry. You\u2019ve got the poor boy carrying your books around school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hurt my shoulder in Transfigurations!\u201d Harry protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been wearing his scarf like a brand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice scarf!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou rarely sleep in your own room anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you <em>seen</em> the beds in the dungeon?\u201d Harry demanded. \u201cThey\u2019re brilliant. It\u2019s completely unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, for Godric\u2019s sake! Even the <em>gossip columns</em> are making bets on how long you two will last. The entire wizarding world basically knows you\u2019re dating him \u2013 <em>except him</em>,\u201d Hermione finished.</p>\n<p>Harry stared blankly. He then continued staring, but less blankly and more grimly. He then continued staring, but less grimly and more embarrassedly.</p>\n<p>He then finally looked properly chastised.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating,\u201d he informed her quietly. \u201cReally, we\u2019re not. He wouldn\u2019t be interested. It\u2019s been difficult enough just getting him to be friends, and he\u2019s never given any hint of anything else...\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione snorted.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked at her.</p>\n<p>Sighing, she gripped his shoulders in both hands and gave him a hard shake. \u201cHarry James Potter. He <em>doesn\u2019t refuse you anything</em>. He went from quietly letting people shove him around and hiding in the library in September \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>(<em>How did she know that?</em>)</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2013 to going on regular Hogsmeade outings and having private dinners and sharing clothes with you. You\u2019re <em>dating him</em>. You\u2019re dating him even more than I\u2019m dating Ron, and I am <em>definitely</em> dating Ron.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked at her again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only difference is Ron and I know it, whereas Malfoy completely doesn\u2019t. You know what he said when I asked him how your date on Sunday went?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stifling the urge to jealously demand why she\u2019d been talking to Draco, Harry blinked at her again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you\u2019re <em>after something</em>, and you\u2019re just <em>biding your time</em> until you can bargain for it.\u201d Her gaze hardened firmly, and Harry took a moment to wonder when Draco\u2019d gotten under her skin like that. \u201cHe thinks you <em>want</em> something from him, something other than him, and I <em>know</em> I raised you better than that. So you stop leading that poor boy in circles and let him know what\u2019s on your mind. Clear?\u201d</p>\n<p>She gave him another hard shake when he didn\u2019t immediately respond.</p>\n<p>Harry squeaked.</p>\n<p>That was enough for him to (kind of) ((sort of)) gather his wits. Managing to mumble something along the lines of \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, sorry, ma\u2019am\u201d (or <em>yes, mum, sorry, mum</em>; it was difficult to tell when he was busily trying to conjure a hole to swallow him up), he made his Gryffindor ancestors proud by bravely turning tail to flee.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked up when Harry entered his room, seemingly unsurprised to see him. The Slytherins had long ago given up trying to keep the password from him, and while Draco still sometimes kicked him out if he wanted to sleep in his own bed for a change (because Harry never seemed to fall asleep on one of the <em>empty</em> beds \u2013 oops?), more often than not he crashed on what used to be Blaise\u2019s.</p>\n<p>He waited expectantly.</p>\n<p>Shuffling in farther, Harry shut the door behind himself and rubbed his neck. \u201cSo, uh \u2013 Hermione mentioned the two of you\u2019ve been talking recently?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stared at him impatiently.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, that\u2019s good \u2013 that\u2019s great!\u201d Harry added hastily. \u201cReally. You both like long books and, and runes, and \u2013 and... stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, Draco set his quill down and turned around in his chair. \u201cStop deflecting and spit it out, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wincing, Harry cleared his throat. He took a deep breath, mustered up his Gryffindor courage, and\u2026</p>\n<p>And he cleared his throat again.</p>\n<p>He took another deep breath.</p>\n<p>He frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I <em>really</em> have an eye twitch?\u201d he blurted out.</p>\n<p>Okay\u2026 he should maybe have continued mustering a little longer.</p>\n<p>Draco stared at him for a moment before slowly raising his eyebrows in disbelief. \u201c<em>That\u2019s</em> what you\u2019re \u2013 oh, for Salazar\u2019s sake. No, you pillock, you have a <em>mouth</em> twitch. You get the look in your eye first, and the mouth twitch starts just before you say something you think is sneaky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince, I don\u2019t know, third year? Fourth? <em>Birth</em>?\u201d Draco huffed. \u201cWhat does it <em>matter</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it matters!\u201d Harry despaired. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever mentioned anything like that before, and even if Snape used to stare at me suspiciously, he stared at <em>everyone</em> suspiciously, so it didn\u2019t exactly mean anything. And now you suddenly say I have these facial tells I never knew about! I\u2019d think you were having me on, since you weren\u2019t behaving the way you normally do when carrying out Fact #299, except Hermione confirmed it today, and I just \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. Wait, wait, <em>wait</em>,\u201d Draco interrupted. \u201cDid you just say \u2018Fact #299\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry froze. \u201cEr\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>did</em>,\u201d Draco declared triumphantly, rising from his seat. \u201cYou only freeze up like that when you\u2019re embarrassed, and since scenarios A and C are irrelevant, it must be scenario B.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScenario B?\u201d Harry echoed. This was starting to feel surreal.</p>\n<p>Draco waved him off impatiently. \u201cWhy are you numbering <em>facts</em> about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you lettering scenarios about <em>me</em>?\u201d Harry retorted, bewildered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018Fact #299\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are scenarios A, B, and C?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are <em>lots</em> of scenarios A, B, and C for different behavioural patterns.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now <em>you\u2019re</em> deflecting!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there <em>are</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of facts, too!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What\u2019s \u2018Fact #299\u2019?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry abruptly noticed that they were all but shouting at each other. He noticed this because they were standing so close that his head was tilted back to look up (and up, and <em>up</em>) at Draco, and the shouting was making his ears pound.</p>\n<p>He sort of thought his heart was pounding, too.</p>\n<p>Was Draco wearing cologne, or had he always smelled this good?</p>\n<p>Were his pupils dilated from the arguing or the proximity?</p>\n<p>Was he <em>blushing</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as important, I think,\u201d he suggested slowly, dropping his voice back down to a decent volume, \u201cas Fact\u2026 I suppose it will be Fact #500.\u201d</p>\n<p>Desperately hoping he was reading the situation correctly, Harry swayed closer, close enough for his bony shoulders to bump Draco\u2019s chest. Draco\u2019s hands reflexively came up to grip his upper arms, but he neither pulled him closer nor pushed him away.</p>\n<p>With their gazes still locked, Harry saw a perplexing play of hesitation, hope, confusion, frustration, disappointment, hesitation, and hope again flashing across his face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked quietly, waiting for \u2013 for whatever Draco wanted, really.</p>\n<p>Swallowing, Draco gently pushed him back. \u201cI\u2026 I believe I\u2019m misinterpreting the current situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s withdrawal only confirming what he hoped the collection of scenarios meant, Harry made a frustrated noise. \u201cWhat is there to misinterpret? I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re on the same page here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a <em>hero</em>, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s heart skipped a beat at hearing his first name coming from the blond; all the same, he felt his stomach lurch at the reminder of how the rest of their world saw him. He hadn\u2019t thought Draco cared about such things. In fact, he\u2019d been <em>positive</em> he didn\u2019t. Their conflicts had always revolved around <em>them</em>, not their social \u2013 </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a <em>criminal</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u2013 clout.</p>\n<p>Wait, what?</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, wait a minute,\u201d Harry protested. \u201cYou are not! You were pardoned!\u201d</p>\n<p>Even knowing that the war was too big to ignore, it was the <em>last</em> thing he wanted to talk about right now. He didn\u2019t want history getting in the way of the present, of their potential, of\u2026 this.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn a technicality. I was pardoned because <em>you</em> testified on my \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were pardoned because you were a <em>minor</em>, and you were coerced with no way out!\u201d Harry shot back hotly. \u201cWhat were you <em>supposed</em> to do when your parents were being held at wandpoint?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sucked in a sharp breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>saw</em> you break down, I saw you and your family <em>tortured</em>, and you <em>still</em> didn\u2019t turn me in when you could have. How could I hold that against you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still deserve better,\u201d Draco argued wearily. \u201cYou deserve someone who never would have wavered in the first place, someone good and brave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot changing is easy,\u201d Harry snapped. \u201cFollowing in your family\u2019s footsteps is easy. Siding with your friends is easy. Doing the right thing when it goes <em>against</em> everything you\u2019ve ever known? When the devil on your shoulder is your own kin? When you\u2019re flanked by friends who are bigger and meaner than you, and you still tell them to stop?</p>\n<p>\u201cAt age eleven, you saw a shadow in the Forbidden Forest and ran off without me; this year, you stayed in <em>Fiendfyre</em> to try and save your unconscious friend. At age thirteen, you refused to bow down to an enormous hippogriff; this year, you\u2019re humbling yourself to <em>me</em>. At age sixteen \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Harry had to pause to swallow around a sudden lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt age sixteen, I nearly killed you while you were desperate and depressed. I watched you bleeding out, and I ran. I never even apologised for it. But this year, you lied to your father\u2019s face to save my life. What could possibly be better and braver than that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never apologised to you, either,\u201d Draco reminded quietly. \u201cNot for anything I\u2019ve said and done to you over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco blinked at him, and frowned. \u201c\u2018Okay\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry repeated. He gave the blond a small smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026 oh.\u201d Realisation dawning, a look of intense discomfort settled on Draco\u2019s face. He took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAccepted,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cAnd for the record\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, too. For being a prat right back\u2026 for the things I said or did that got you in trouble, too\u2026 for taking your wand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking my wand kept the Elder Wand away from the Dark Lord,\u201d Draco pointed out. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologise for <em>that</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking your wand left you helpless to protect yourself during a war. You\u2019re the one who had Voldemort\u201d \u2013 Harry resisted the impulse to roll his eyes at Draco\u2019s reflexive flinch \u2013 \u201cand the Death Eaters actually in your home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one they were trying to <em>kill</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry waved him off impatiently. \u201cSomeone\u2019s always trying to kill me; I\u2019m pretty used to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a disgruntled look. \u201cThat\u2019s not the <em>point</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd neither is this entire argument!\u201d Harry declared. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long history of fighting. I <em>know</em> that. We\u2019re probably <em>always</em> going to fight. We bicker when we\u2019re getting along, for Godric\u2019s sake. And we\u2019re going to have some long, bad talks about the war, too. But that\u2019ll happen no matter what so long as we stay in touch, I think. Which, you know, I\u2019d <em>really</em> like to do. The point is \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>And here, his Gryffindor courage hiccupped again.</p>\n<p>Fidgeting uncomfortably, he cleared his throat. He shuffled his feet. He rubbed his neck. He avoided Draco\u2019s eyes to stare roughly at his throat.</p>\n<p>Draco sighed, cupped his cheeks, and bent down (and down, and <em>down</em>) to kiss him soundly. \u201cYes,\u201d he stated firmly, \u201cI like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry replied, slightly dazed from both the kiss and his sheer disbelief that this was actually happening. \u201cOkay. Good. I, uh\u2026 I mean, I like you. Too. I like you, too. A lot. Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a few more seconds of standing about awkwardly, the situation finally sank in, and Harry broke out into a grin. \u201cWait, so then \u2013 so we\u2026 we\u2019re\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Snorting softly, Draco slid his arms down and around to Harry\u2019s lower back and pulled him in closer. \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want,\u201d Harry confirmed almost before Draco finished speaking.</p>\n<p>For the first time in over a year, Draco smiled.</p>\n<p>Harry tried not to expire.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen yeah. Yeah, \u2018we\u2019re\u2019. Whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mission <em>finally</em> accomplished.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Operation MFwDM: Debriefing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Over the course of Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy, Harry learned several things:</p>\n<p>1. He learned that maybe he couldn't read people as well as he'd previously believed.<br>\nCase 1a: He'd had no idea that Draco had been interested in him. He could forgive himself for this one, seeing as how he'd been too busy (badly) hiding his own interest.<br>\nCase 1b: He'd had no idea that Hermione knew when he was scheming, and apparently tolerated it anyway. This was a bit more difficult to accept, given that she was one of his best and oldest friends.</p>\n<p>2. He learned that maybe he wasn't as sneaky as he'd previously believed.<br>\nCase 2a: His apparent transparency when scheming. What did it say about him that both his best friend and his former rival had to <em>inform</em> him of what his visual tells were?<br>\nCase 2b: The public awareness of Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy. Really, the collage of newspaper clippings Ron and Ginny'd given him sort of made him want to stick his head under a pillow and not come out. Did he really look that soppy?</p>\n<p>3. He learned that maybe neither of these points really mattered, because:<br>\nReason 3a: It was sort of nice to know that he <em>could</em> fail at reading people now, and it was okay. He was done with fighting.<br>\nReason 3b: It was definitely nice to know that he had people who cared enough to read <em>him</em>.<br>\nReason 3c: It was even <em>nicer</em> to know that those same people accepted him enough to take the piss out of him.</p>\n<p>And most importantly:</p>\n<p>Reason 3d. Despite these minor failings in self-awareness, he still got the guy.</p>"
