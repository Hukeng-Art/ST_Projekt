  "notes": "<p>Ahhh, wondrous Good Omens! I have never been an expert superfan of the book -- I\u2019ve read it a few times and enjoyed it immensely, especially our beloved angel/demon romcom, but I definitely am not super aware of every nuance, so my apologies if any of this contradicts canon!</p>\n<p>I sped through the miniseries adaptation all in a rush and enjoyed it tremendously, especially (of course) the wonderful Aziraphale and Crowley of it all; yesterday, I found myself hankering for just a little more time with them, and so this fic was born and then -- as fics often do -- grew way more gigantic than I had anticipated! God bless Michael Sheen and David Tennant for their totally wonderful performances, and also for rhapsodizing over shipping it hard in all the behind-the-scenes interviews. This was definitely written with their particular incarnations of the characters in mind.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure that a ton of debate has gone on re: sexual experience and the ineffable husbands for the many years this fine fandom has blessed our world: the energy I got from the adaptation was that that was part of the human-y experience that hadn\u2019t really been on the radar for either of them before, so that is the approach that this particular story takes! But of course, now that they\u2019ve chosen a side (the world\u2019s side, specifically), they\u2019ve got all those pesky human feelings fully kicking in ...</p>\n<p>Thanks to -- of course -- Queen for the title, which is from \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy.\" I HAD TO.</p>\n<p>This is the first of five chapters. I originally meant for it to be a one-shot but decided to divvy it up for organization's sake. The rest of the installments are already written and just need a little more polishing up, so fortunately, there won't be much of a wait!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>I apologize for having so many damn lyrics in this thing. I blame the show's impeccably great soundtrack for kindling that mood!!</p>\n<p>I would like to thank Jason Mendoza from The Good Place for a phrase that I somehow just couldn\u2019t resist borrowing, because truly, even after much contemplation, I could not conceive of a better one.</p>\n<p>Aaah, I can't believe this has been getting attention already! Thank you so much, everybody! &lt;3 INEFFABLE HUSBANDS 4EVS.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p><b>A note as of 7/15/19:</b> Thank you so much for your enthusiasm, readers!!! It is a pure joy. I've caught up on answering comments and instated a policy (ooh, so fancy) of mostly just replying to comments on Chapter 5, since I don't want to bombard your inboxes with repeated thanks. Please know that I have cherished and been totally delighted by all your comments on Chs. 1-4 too even if I haven't responded to them!</p>",
  "text": "<p>Aziraphale never would have asked it once. But the world hasn\u2019t ended, and he\u2019s a free agent now, in a manner of speaking. So for the first time in his long life, this angel is experimenting with bravery, by golly. Not the save-the-world sort. The quiet everyday sort.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we, do you think?\u201d he asks Crowley when he\u2019s visiting his flat, inspecting the little indoor forest of magnificent plants. He\u2019s been visiting Crowley more than usual lately. At first, he recoiled a little from the sparse, sleek darkness of his dear friend\u2019s home, but he\u2019s beginning to appreciate it; it <em> feels </em>like Crowley. Even though it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s not cold or cruel. And he does like plants.</p>\n<p>And asking big questions.</p>\n<p><em> Are we a couple? </em> is what he means. Everyone seems to think so, if you can believe it. Bookshop customers and chatty ex-nuns of Satan and random passersby on the street. It isn\u2019t entirely new. A lot of knowing looks flashed at them over the past many centuries have begun to make sense in retrospect. It\u2019s just that it hadn\u2019t occurred to him to imagine himself as someone who could be half of a couple. Angels don\u2019t have significant others, demon or otherwise.</p>\n<p>But now that he\u2019s no longer your typical angel -- well.</p>\n<p>The most recent culprit was Adam Young\u2019s mother Deirdre, who called to invite them to Adam\u2019s upcoming twelfth birthday party. She still doesn\u2019t seem entirely sure <em> why </em>Adam knows two grown men from London, but she\u2019s very friendly anyway. \u201cDo bring your husband with the cool sunglasses. Adam was very insistent about that. He would love to see both of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018I can\u2019t bring my husband because I don\u2019t have a husband\u2019 would have been the technically correct response, but Aziraphale knew what she meant and wasn\u2019t one to nitpick a polite invitation to death.</p>\n<p>Then he told Crowley about it, for a reason he still isn\u2019t quite certain of. He just wanted to watch whatever happened on Crowley\u2019s face at the news.</p>\n<p>Now, Crowley is quiet for a moment that sings with uncertainty. Aziraphale does wish he would take off the sunglasses and show his eyes for once. Then he sputters into Crowley-ness. \u201cLord, no. Not in the way they mean it, at least. You and me against the world? Yeah. Always. But in the way they mean it, it\u2019s all wandering hands and nether-bits and expensive jewelry and rapid disillusionment and divorce attorneys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale doesn\u2019t know how to untangle any of that, so he picks out the easiest part of the reply. \u201c\u2018Lord.\u2019 That\u2019s very pious language.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot necessarily. Could mean anybody. Could be \u2018Lord Byron.\u2019 In fact, from this point on, it's always Lord Byron.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLord Byron,\u201d Aziraphale says with a little nostalgic sigh.</p>\n<p>Crowley chuckles. \u201cThat was a time, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt truly was. Such great poetry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch great parties,\u201d Crowley rhapsodizes in the same tone. \u00a0Then he adds in a joking mutter, \u201cTalk about someone obsessed with wandering hands and nether-bits.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale blushes, thinking briefly of the time he and Crowley had spent a weekend politely declining, and then haphazardly evading, Lord Byron\u2019s many invitations to, er, join in with him and his paramours. As a fan of literature, it was extraordinary to socialize with Byron. As a celestial being with no interest in carnal delights, well, you were liable to find yourself climbing out a villa window in the middle of the night and then swimming to less lusty ground for safety.</p>\n<p>That had turned out to be one of his funner adventures with Crowley, in the end.</p>\n<p>Life is usually fun with Crowley.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re not a couple, then,\u201d he says, clearing his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d says Crowley nonchalantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we start telling people that? When they mistake us for one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd explain that we\u2019re an angel and a demon who\u2019ve been cast out of our respective realms to form an eternal alliance of two? Doesn\u2019t seem worth the bother, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Aziraphale, feeling unaccountably pleased, \u201call right, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHumans will think what they think,\u201d Crowley concludes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey always do,\u201d Aziraphale says fondly.</p>\n<p>That settled, Aziraphale returns his attention to the plants, murmuring little encouragements to them. Crowley had lectured him once about not going soft on them (\u201cthey\u2019ve got to <em> learn</em>, angel\u201d), but soft -- Aziraphale has decided -- isn\u2019t always a bad thing.</p>\n<p>He compliments one of them for looking especially verdant today, then glances up to see Crowley watching him with a little smile. The smile disappears as soon as he realizes Aziraphale\u2019s caught him, but that can\u2019t change the fact that it <em> was </em> there.</p>\n<p>The especially verdant plant bursts into pink blooms not at all consistent with its genus.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Aziraphale sputters. \u201cCan\u2019t--can\u2019t imagine how that happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you done to my plant??\u201d Crowley whooshes over.</p>\n<p>\u201cMade it prettier,\u201d Aziraphale says defensively.</p>\n<p>Crowley considers the plant\u2019s makeover.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d he capitulates.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Aziraphale says, hopefully with the self-possessed air of someone who spontaneously transforms plants all the time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you get for the antichrist who has everything?\u201d Crowley muses. They\u2019re standing in the middle of a toy shop, seriously contemplating birthday presents for the first time in their long, long existences.</p>\n<p>\u201cA nice hula hoop?\u201d Aziraphale ventures.</p>\n<p>Crowley snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you, gentlemen?\u201d the clerk asks, coming over.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for something for our godson,\u201d Aziraphale says. \u201cHe\u2019s turning twelve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd before you ask,\u201d Crowley adds dryly, \u201che\u2019s already got a hellhound.\u201d</p>\n<p>Half hour later, they\u2019ve got a formidable beast of a squirt gun with all the terrifying bells and whistles imaginable, a drone, a handsome hardcover set of Great Books (\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just give him some from your shop? You know, where you\u2019re supposed to be <em> selling the books</em>.\u201d \u201cBite your once-forked tongue!\u201d), and one hula hoop. There\u2019s something to be said for classic entertainment, Aziraphale maintains.</p>\n<p>The clerk bids them farewell and declares that the birthday boy is lucky to have such a nice couple for godparents.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see,\u201d Aziraphale says as they step outside, \u201cthat\u2019s precisely what I\u2019m talking about. Everyone thinks we\u2019re an item.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot <em> everyone</em>,\u201d Crowley protests as they shove their bags into the back seat of the Bentley.</p>\n<p>They climb in. As soon as it\u2019s switched on, the car\u2019s speakers blare out:</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)</em>\n<br>\n<em> Ooh ooh can you feel my love heat</em>\n<br>\n<em> Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love</em>\n<br>\n<em> And tell me how do you feel right after-all</em>\n<br>\n<em> I'd like for you and I to go romancing<br> Say the word, your wish is my command</em>\n</p>\n<p>Aziraphale clears his throat awkwardly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a car,\u201d Crowley says defensively. \u201cCars don\u2019t speculate over relationship statuses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d says Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>\n<em>When I'm not with you</em>\n<br>\n<em> Think of me always<br> Love you, love you</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cBentley Rule Number One: don\u2019t <em> ever </em> read into the Queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight-o,\u201d says Aziraphale as Crowley steers them haphazardly out into the street.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine precisely</em>\n<br>\n<em> (One two three four five six seven eight nine o' clock)</em>\n<br>\n<em> I will pay the bill, you taste the wine</em>\n<br>\n<em> Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely</em>\n<br>\n<em> Just take me back to yours, that will be fine<br> (Come on and get it!)</em>\n</p>\n<p>When the time comes, they drive out to Tadfield for Adam\u2019s birthday party with the back seat full of resplendently wrapped presents. To Aziraphale, the drive is almost as delightful as the prospect of a party; he\u2019s always liked riding around with Crowley, underneath the bubble of nervousness inspired by the demon\u2019s disdain for speed limits and turn signals.</p>\n<p>(Underneath the endless, staccato refrain of <em> You should not be doing this, you should not be liking this, you should not be doing this, you should not be liking this </em>that the ever-blaring speakers could never quite drown out. That bit has finally, finally gone silent for good.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s especially nice when they\u2019re not bogged down in otherworldly business, and can simply enjoy each other\u2019s company.</p>\n<p>Crowley spends most of the journey trying to educate Aziraphale on the virtues of The Smiths.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to this bit, this bit\u2019s the best--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m listening!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley yowls along, \u201c<em>And if a double-decker bus</em><br><em> Crashes into us</em><br><em> To die by your side</em><br><em> Is such a heavenly way to die,</em><br><em> And if a ten-ton truck</em><br><em> Kills the both of us</em><br><em> To die by your side<br> Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s morbid!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful! \u2018Heavenly\u2019 -- that\u2019s your lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound the least bit heavenly.\" Well, perhaps it does and that's the problem. \"To live by your side, that\u2019s the really heavenly thing. Er. Someone\u2019s side. For the sake of this argument.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, man. Have you no heart? Those <em> lyrics</em>: that\u2019s love.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time they arrive, Aziraphale thinks himself pretty well persuaded. He still calls it \u2018be-bop\u2019 one last time, because he quite likes the effect that has.</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear you\u2019re just doing it to torture me at this point,\u201d Crowley moans, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d Aziraphale says angelically.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale can see the serpentine gleam of appreciation even through Crowley\u2019s dark lenses, and feels unaccountably pleased with himself.</p>\n<p>The party takes place in the Youngs\u2019 back garden, and it\u2019s an absolutely sublime gathering. All of Adam\u2019s best mates are there, wearing paper crowns and chattering happily, forever fascinated by each other\u2019s company. The grownups include Anathema Device and Newton Pulsifer in addition to Adam\u2019s parents and some neighborhood folks, and it\u2019s very nice indeed to see ordinary people (if there\u2019s any such thing) and apocalypse fighters all blended together. It makes one feel as if they might have a real place in the world after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, how did you two meet?\u201d Mrs. Young asks, kindly bringing Aziraphale a slice of cake. Crowley is watching Mr. Young man the grill, and keeps subtly adjusting the flames with little twitches of his fingers. (Crowley has great moral objections to overcooked meat. \u201cAlmost as big a waste as the fourteenth century.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Aziraphale is taken aback by the inquiry. No one has ever actually asked that question before.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe happened across each other one day in a garden -- public garden, that is -- and fell into a very interesting philosophical conversation,\u201d he says after a moment, watching Crowley, \u201cand then, er, it started raining, so I covered him with my w-- umbrella. And, well, we just seemed to keep crossing paths after that, and finally decided we might as well start doing it on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Mrs. Young says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose it was rather,\u201d Aziraphale agrees as Crowley catches his eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have you been together now?\u201d Mrs. Young asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Crowley says, breezing over and putting an arm around Aziraphale, \u201cforever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale smiles at him. Crowley grins back until he notices that Mr. Young is overcooking the hamburgers. He swears and darts across the garden, trying to coax the flames down with hand movements that must be perplexing to the normal human eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cBless him,\u201d Aziraphale says fondly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The party carries on. Aziraphale is quite overcome by the festive atmosphere, and, after his third slice of cake, decides there\u2019s only one way to properly honor such a significant occasion. He must have a telling look on his face, because a certain demon is onto him at once.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d says Crowley with dawning horror, dropping his fork mid-bite of cake.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Aziraphale joyfully.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>NO MAGIC</b>,\u201d Crowley snarls. The blue sky is suddenly overtaken by clouds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like magic,\u201d says Adam, coming over. The firmament clears.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot this magic, you don\u2019t,\u201d Crowley says darkly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Adam urges Aziraphale, his eyes bright with encouragement.</p>\n<p>And, well, you can\u2019t very well disappoint the birthday boy/former antichrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Aziraphale says, heading back to the Bentley, where he always keeps his magic act supplies stashed in case of party emergencies. \u201cPencil my magician\u2019s moustache on for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em> not </em>penciling your bloody magician\u2019s moustache on,\u201d Crowley protests, stalking after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you always do it so nicely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot this time. I\u2019m putting my foot down. I mean it. Right down to the earth\u2019s core. Shoes-melted-by-lava style. You owe me new shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gives him an imploring look largely inspired by Dog the dog.</p>\n<p>Crowley holds out for seven and a half seconds. Then: \u201cAughhhh! <em> Fine. </em> But I\u2019m drawing it crooked.\u201d</p>\n<p>A quick inspection in the Bentley\u2019s side mirror a few minutes later informs Aziraphale that Crowley\u2019s drawn it <em> perfectly.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later, Aziraphale is performing his magic act.</p>\n<p>He likes to think he\u2019s gotten much better than last time around, too. When he pulls a coin out of Wensleydale\u2019s ear, the boy gasps while his friends tease him about needing to wash up more often.</p>\n<p>When he moves on to Adam, an absolute bucket's worth of coins falls from both of his ears, which Aziraphale strongly suspects\u00a0has to do more with Adam than anything he's done. Still, everyone laughs uproariously, and Mr. Young says that he ought to be paying Aziraphale for this level of quality entertainment, so might as well count that as a win.</p>\n<p>Made a little too bold by success and cake, Aziraphale attempts the trick on a less receptive audience member.</p>\n<p>Crowley catches his wrist before Aziraphale can put his hand anywhere ear-adjacent. \u201cI can\u2019t sit idly by and watch this happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen get up here with me,\u201d Aziraphale says, \u201cfor I\u2019m certainly not stopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese children helped avert the apocalypse. They deserve a proper show.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine then,\u201d Aziraphale huffs, pulling Crowley out of his seat. \u201cGood audience, may I present ... my dashing assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley gives him a look of such deep loathing that it makes Aziraphale cackle aloud. Not his usual style, but it really can\u2019t be helped under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Crowley is a natural. He cheats and uses real magic, the sort you can\u2019t learn from <em> Magic for Dummies</em>, but considering what a spoilsport he\u2019s been in the past on this matter, Aziraphale is happy to accept any effort at all. In no time, the back garden is full of fireworks and doves and rabbits and one accidental toad, not to mention an endless supply of confetti falling from the sky. Dog barks at the new animal arrivals and chases them around with mad glee. Aziraphale sees to it that no actual harm can befall the dear creatures. It\u2019s the chasing, anyway, that\u2019s the joyful thing.</p>\n<p>Adam and the other children laugh their heads off (Crowley\u2019s saw-himself-in-half trick <em> is </em> pretty good, in a grisly way) and the adults are chuckling too, and all this combined merriment seems to elevate this ordinary back garden into some small paradise.</p>\n<p>At the end of their performance, Crowley grabs Aziraphale\u2019s hand and they bow again and again to their cheering audience, a perfect double act.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could take this on the road,\u201d Aziraphale can\u2019t resist saying.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that was our first and last show ever,\u201d Crowley says from between grinning teeth. He tightens his grip on Aziraphale\u2019s hand in a way that\u2019s somehow not at all unpleasant.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d says Aziraphale, smiling triumphantly. \u201cIt was an impeccably drawn magician\u2019s moustache, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well. I\u2019m a demon, not a monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an outdoor Sondheim revue a few weeks later. Aziraphale finds the tickets waiting for him on the desk in the bookshop one morning, alongside a note that says, <em>Next time we\u2019ll see The Sound of Music, but don't dust off your lederhosen just yet.\u00a0</em>At the bottom of the note is a familiar symbol of a twisting serpent, the sight of which really shouldn\u2019t make an angel\u2019s heart leap with gladness like one of Pavlov\u2019s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a little black mark in front of the serpent that might be a meaningless curve or might be an x<em> . </em>Aziraphale spends what some might call an inordinate amount of time trying to decide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The revue is in the park in the evening, and Crowley scored them seats close to the front. The buzz of excitement in the air is delicious, so many people keen to come together and celebrate something human-made and beautiful. Aziraphale can\u2019t imagine for one second wanting to trade all this just to win a war. He feels a renewed wave of gratitude for being just where he is, in one folding chair of many underneath dozens of golden glowing paper lanterns, slightly uncomfortable for the sake of good music with the person he loves most by his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cSimply stunning,\u201d he murmurs to Crowley as the music starts, meaning all of it. The orchestra and the singers, the dimming murmur of the audience and the birds in the trees. What symphonies the world spins every hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cMusical theatre,\u201d Crowley mutters, slouching back in his seat. \u201cPretty sure that\u2019s one of mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hush.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Mother said \"Straight ahead,\" </em><br> <em> Not to delay or be misled. </em><br> <em> I should have heeded her advice, </em><br> <em> But he seemed so nice.</em></p>\n<p>As the concert veers to <em> Into the Woods</em>, Aziraphale tries with all his might to look like someone who is <em> not </em>overidentifying with Little Red Riding Hood. There\u2019s no basis for it. Wolves and serpents: very different. Beastly apples and oranges, really.</p>\n<p><em> And he showed me things, </em><br> <em> Many beautiful things </em><br> <em> That I hadn't thought to explore. </em><br> <em> They were off my path, </em><br> <em> So I never had dared.</em></p>\n<p>Aziraphale very deliberately doesn\u2019t look at Crowley.</p>\n<p><em> I had been so careful, </em><br> <em> I never had cared. </em><br> <em> And he made me feel excited-- </em><br> <em> Well, excited and scared.</em></p>\n<p>Until he does. By accident.</p>\n<p>Crowley wriggles his eyebrows at Aziraphale devilishly. Well, Crowley is always devilish. But in this particular moment, he\u2019s devilish plus a little extra. Aziraphale huffs and looks back up at the stage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, when the night has darkened just perfectly for <em> A Little Night Music</em>, Aziraphale is pulled out of his own emotional reverie during \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d by a sound uncannily like sniffling.</p>\n<p><em>Just when I'd stopped opening doors,</em><br> <em> Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours,</em><br> <em> Making my entrance again with my usual flair,<br> Sure of my lines, no one is there.</em></p>\n<p>He looks over to see a tear sliding past Crowley\u2019s sunglasses down his cheek, gleaming in the mingled light of the paper lanterns and the moon above.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, Aziraphale would think for a moment -- draw up a mental list of pros and cons (marvelous invention, the pro/con list) and then err on the side of <em> Better not</em>. But just this once, his fingers decide for him.</p>\n<p>He reaches over, unthinking, and presses a fingertip very gently to Crowley\u2019s face. The tear is warm, and Crowley\u2019s cheek is cool and smooth. What a thing it is, to touch someone on purpose. The smallest point of contact, yet it dances in the rest of you, scalp to toes.</p>\n<p>Crowley stays very still, and doesn\u2019t say a thing for once. It would be rude to, of course, in the middle of a concert, but Crowley has never worried much about rudeness before.</p>\n<p>Then he wraps his fingers around Aziraphale\u2019s wrist, slow and careful like you would with an animal you don\u2019t want to frighten away. Ordinarily, Aziraphale <em> would </em> move away. Moving away from the demon, he had staunchly believed for centuries upon centuries, was the rules. No matter how much you wanted to stay put instead.</p>\n<p>This time, he stays put, lacing his fingers through Crowley\u2019s.</p>\n<p>They carefully hold hands, neither daring to look at the other, until they have to let go to applaud. When they leave, they don\u2019t say a thing about it, slipping instead into banter about how next time, they\u2019re going to something that Crowley chooses (never mind that Crowley got the tickets) and that it will most definitely be something with a beat and ideally an electric guitar.</p>\n<p>At home alone in the bookshop that night, Aziraphale stares down at his fingers and wonders where on earth it\u2019s coming from, this feeling like waking up.</p>\n<p>The next time they\u2019re assumed to be a couple, it\u2019s on the invitation that arrives in the mail announcing Newt and Anathema\u2019s wedding. Aziraphale checks off beef for Crowley and fish for himself on the RSVP and sends it back with a smiley face drawn beside the checked <em> \u2018Yes.'</em></p>\n<p>Crowley insists that they get Aziraphale some new clothes for the occasion. He takes him to a fancy shop full of lofty employees that Aziraphale finds slightly terrifying and Crowley commands with the unbothered grace of an emperor. Crowley picks out a number of things with swift efficiency and then sends Aziraphale into a changing room, saying he\u2019ll be just outside playing some ridiculous game about cupcakes on his mobile phone.</p>\n<p>(Crowley had been especially proud of his invention of mobile phone games, the demonic reasoning behind them being that people would never get anything done with the promise of mindless fun forever at their fingertips. He then promptly got addicted to mobile phone games. When Aziraphale had chastened him for it, Crowley had protested, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect them to be so shiny! Look!\u201d Aziraphale, wisely, had not looked.)</p>\n<p>It feels strange to be locked up in this little room. Changing clothes at all is really a very <em> human </em> thing. He catches his own eye in the mirror and makes a \u201cwell, old boy, we\u2019re in it now\u201d face. He\u2019s never really understood the mortal anxiety about reflections. Appraising your body like a thing you\u2019ve bought instead of a thing you are. Wanting to take pride in it, hoping that someone else will love all its intricacies and imperfections. It all seems like so much unnecessary bother.</p>\n<p>Though maybe it would be nice to have someone love the sight of you. That isn\u2019t so very hard to understand, when you think about it.</p>\n<p>After a few sartorial misfires that make him wince at his reflection, he finds something he quite likes. It\u2019s a cream-colored suit not so different from his usual shade, but much suaver. More debonair super spy, less librarian. (One could argue there are no people more debonair than librarians, but that's probably a debate for another time.)</p>\n<p>When he steps out of the dressing room, Crowley looks up at him. The game on the mobile phone makes a bunch of irritated beeps, but miraculously, Crowley seems to have forgotten it exists.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it ridiculous?\u201d Aziraphale asks nervously, glancing down at the suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Crowley says, his mouth forgetting to entirely close itself. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 good. It\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Aziraphale says, relieved, and goes back into the dressing room to shake off the new clothes and the new feeling. <em> Thou shalt not like it when someone looks at you like you\u2019re a delicious ice cream sundae with a cherry on top</em>, and all that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that the wedding doesn\u2019t take place in a church.</p>\n<p>Instead, it\u2019s in a field in the country on a cloudy day with some sheep nearby (as perfect a wedding setting as you can have without God on the guest list, if you ask Aziraphale), officiated by the lovely Madame Tracy, a woman of many talents indeed. Dog the dog, wearing a handsome blue bowtie and surely the most respectable-looking hellhound in history, serves as ring-bearer. Adam, Pepper, Brian, and Wensleydale are responsible for throwing fistfuls of flower petals at particularly celebratory moments, and they rise to the occasion beautifully. Anathema wears a resplendent gown of golden yellow and her usual thick-rimmed spectacles, and she and Newt stare at each other with all the world\u2019s mushy devotion. It\u2019s quite an impulsive thing, to marry a little over a year after you\u2019ve met, but Aziraphale can\u2019t fault them for it. You never know when life will take a turn for the much shorter than you\u2019d anticipated; might as well love with all your heart while you can.</p>\n<p>He sneaks a glance to his left at Crowley, who\u2019s somehow managed to sit in his folding chair like it\u2019s a chaise lounge.</p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t a church threshold for the newly-wed couple to walk out of once they\u2019ve said \u201cI do\u201d, so the wedding party pelts cheers and handfuls of rice at them on the stroll to the pavilion where the reception will be held. Aziraphale tosses a few doves in as well. It\u2019s never a wedding or a magic show without doves.</p>\n<p>\u201cRisky move, doves,\u201d Crowley says to him. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure getting shat on is on no bride\u2019s wedding day to-do list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously, these are the non-shitting variety of dove. I\u2019m not a <em> novice</em>, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s mouth quirks. With a swish of his hand, he fills the air with golden sparks that dance behind the couple in between grains of rice and wings of dove.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fire</em>?\u201d Aziraphale says indignantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you ask me, any sensible bride would take being set on fire over being shat on. No question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly! You can\u2019t just go around setting <em> fires </em> at <em> weddings</em>; this is the twenty-first century, people spend a lot of money on nuptials these days,\u201d Aziraphale says, bustling forward to try to snuff out the nearest sparks.</p>\n<p>Crowley grabs his arm. \u201cRelax. They\u2019re non-flammable. All for show.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sure enough, Aziraphale catches one of the sparks on his fingertip and it melts away like a glowing snowflake.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are rather pretty,\u201d he admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll for you,\u201d Crowley says, certainly joking, and then saunters away toward the bar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you so much for having us,\u201d Aziraphale says to Anathema, drinking in the lovely decor inside the pavilion, once the reception\u2019s begun.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. You were there for our first very special day. It didn\u2019t seem right to have you and your Mr. Crowley miss this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not, er, a couple, you know. Not in the \u2018til death do us part way.\u201d He gestures vaguely toward the little figurines on the towering wedding cake. \u201cAlthough, well, let death try! It tried a bit, in point of fact. Didn\u2019t get very far. A ha ha!\u201d The awkward laugh reverberates in his ears. He has to kill it somehow. \u201cYou know. Friendy friends. That\u2019s us.\u201d Well, that hasn\u2019t fixed anything. Blast it.</p>\n<p>Anathema just stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he goes on, possessed by the ghost of social faux pas. \u201cIs there a--an Agnes Nutter prophecy that says different? <em> The angel and the demon shalt maketh with the smoochies</em>, or something like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a break from prophecies for now,\u201d Anathema says, an amused little smile playing at her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Aziraphale replies weakly.</p>\n<p>They stare at each other. Aziraphale contemplates finding the largest nearby body of water and hurling himself in. He wonders if maybe Percy Bysshe Shelley had just said something incredibly stupid the night of that fateful swim.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve still got basic powers of observation, though,\u201d Anathema adds innocently.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow lovely. Me too,\u201d Aziraphale says absently. Then he registers the remark. \u201cWait. Was that meant to imply something?\u201d</p>\n<p>By that point, though, Anathema\u2019s woven away from him to chat with other guests.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no staying glum over that disastrous conversation for long. The reception is a wonderful time. Aziraphale gets lots of compliments on his new suit, which Crowley -- dressed to the nines, or maybe even the elevens, in a slim dark grey suit that gleams purple in a certain light -- takes all the credit for. Everyone is in bright spirits through the cutting of the cake and the tossing of the bouquet (Aziraphale catches it by accident, but hands it to the nearest mopey-looking young woman he sees), and after the bride and groom share their first dance, they make an announcement that turns Aziraphale\u2019s whole world on itself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to do something especially festive to celebrate this day,\u201d Newt says, \u201cand a certain someone recommended a dance that\u2019s fallen unjustly out of fashion over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease join us now,\u201d Anathema says grandly, \u201cfor a wedding day gavotte.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looks at Crowley in awe. \u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI might\u2019ve.\u201d Crowley tries, not quite successfully, to hide his grin. \u201cGet dancing, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. But only because I\u2019m an incredible dancer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale has seen Crowley dance before, but decides not to argue the point.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an impeccable gavotte; clearly everyone practiced beforehand, perhaps nobody more than Sergeant Shadwell. Madame Tracy is beside herself with joy. Aziraphale is pleased to discover that he himself remembers every step. Those days in the gentlemen\u2019s club in the late nineteenth century really paid off. (Such friendly chaps, too.)</p>\n<p>The dance involves a great deal of prancing about and swishing one\u2019s arms gracefully and switching partners, a lot of touching and a lot of letting go. Every time he and Crowley come face to face with each other, Crowley bungles the steps horribly -- too much sashaying, which works well when he walks but abysmally here -- but Aziraphale is glad to dance with him anyway.</p>\n<p>When the gavotte comes to a close at last, all the happy dancers applaud and bow to each other. The music slips into a modern slow song. People begin to pair off. Aziraphale, it will come as no surprise, has never slow danced, and suspects it\u2019s time for him to shuffle off the floor. The buffet is beginning to call his name anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on then,\u201d Crowley says like a mindreader, catching Aziraphale\u2019s hand in his. \u201cYou can\u2019t not dance at a wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cModern dancing has no complexity to it,\u201d Aziraphale laments as they begin to sway, mostly to distract himself from the way their fingers fold perfectly into each other\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Crowley scoffs. \u201cClearly you haven\u2019t seen flossing yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s for teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re extremely uncool, do you know that? But you\u2019re right. Modern dancing: no style.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCozy, though,\u201d Aziraphale adds tentatively after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley agrees, \u201ccozy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale leans in closer, resting his head against Crowley\u2019s. As they sway around the room, he spots Anathema smiling at them like she\u2019s just watched a prophecy prove itself true.</p>\n<p>The cloudy weather eventually gives way to rain. It isn\u2019t so bad, really: the sound of it falling onto the pavilion roof is sweet as a lullaby (as Crowley\u2019s voice, maybe, without all the lyrics about blood and brains that he\u2019d made up for poor young Warlock and then insisted on reenacting for Aziraphale). It\u2019s a wonderful thing, to be warm and dry in a very nice suit and pulled close in someone special\u2019s arms, staring out at the sky and grass and increasingly sodden sheep. For so many years, hiding in the bookshop had seemed the only way to endure this very long life; keeping his nose in a book and his head in the sand, hoping heaven wouldn\u2019t ask too much of him.</p>\n<p>Now heaven is done asking, for now at least, and earth keeps giving. All it takes is being brave enough to reach out and say yes.</p>\n<p>Listening to the rain, he remembers lifting one wing over Crowley\u2019s head to shelter him from the first storm, the easiest thing he had done at that point in his comparatively young life. Simple instinct: <em> I\u2019ll take care of you. </em></p>\n<p>Aziraphale only realizes he\u2019s closed his eyes when he opens them. Crowley\u2019s fingers are still twined with his, his other hand resting lightly on Aziraphale\u2019s back. Little golden sparks float around them as they dance, a quiet celebration long overdue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on now. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a modern world. Everyone does it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the risks involved \u2026 I don\u2019t think they should be underestimated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale. You\u2019ve helped stop the apocalypse. You\u2019ve rebelled against Heaven itself. You <em>finally</em> bought some new outfits. Now live a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so Aziraphale agrees to let Crowley teach him to drive.</p>\n<p>They go out to the country, on the rationale that a) Aziraphale would like to shuffle off this mortal coil in a picturesque location, and b) Crowley would like to practice where there\u2019s nobody to hear Aziraphale scream in the event that he destroys Crowley\u2019s beloved Bentley.</p>\n<p>Crowley explains how everything works. Aziraphale has always been a fast learner when it comes to things that don\u2019t involve questioning deeply ingrained ideological structures, so he picks it up without any trouble. It\u2019s a very simple process, really. Clever of humans to think it up. He always felt quite guilty for inconveniencing horses back in the day.</p>\n<p>Still, with his hands on the wheel, staring out at the winding road that stretches in front of them, he feels nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I wreck your car, I\u2019ll understand if you\u2019re not in the mood to speak to me for fifty years or so,\u201d Aziraphale says grimly. \u201cI shall miss your company, but I understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t wreck it, you big worrywart,\u201d Crowley replies, exasperated. Then, kinder: \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale takes a deep breath and puts his foot down on the gas pedal, thinking (though he won\u2019t admit it for the life of him), <em> What the hell. Here we go. </em></p>\n<p>They zoom down the narrow, loopy road; it's the closest thing to flying that isn\u2019t the thing itself. Who knew that humans had found a way to capture such a feeling, make it as ordinary a part of their everyday lives as breathing? Well, Crowley. Crowley always knows, always finds the beauty in this sad, sweet, aching, delightful world and grabs it for himself.</p>\n<p>Each slight turn feels like a dip on a rollercoaster, or what he imagines a rollercoaster would be like. (Should he and Crowley go to Disneyland? Food for thought.) The scenery flies by in a festival of green ground and cloud-kissed blue sky. They finally come to a stop at the end of the road, pausing instead of turning onto the next one. It seems over in a flash,\u00a0but endless too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, that was \u2026 that was so <em> fun</em>,\u201d Aziraphale says, unable to stop grinning.</p>\n<p>Crowley beams back at him, and Aziraphale feels a surge of such love that he thinks he might combust. What is one supposed to do with all this feeling? He\u2019s really starting to understand why humans are so set on touching each other. Reaching across the space and saying with their hands and lips and who knows what else, <em> This. This is what I feel for you. </em></p>\n<p>And so, quite out of his mind, he ventures, \u201cWhat if we kissed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKissed?\u201d Crowley repeats blankly.</p>\n<p>Might as well stick to it now. \u201cYou know, like couples do. Since we\u2019re more or less a couple, when you stop to really think about it. Couples dance at weddings. We\u2019re a couple, mostly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are, aren\u2019t we,\u201d Crowley says faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Aziraphale goes on, cautious, \u201cthere could be certain advantages. I could put together a pro/con list--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do a pro/con list when you want to snog somebody,\u201d Crowley interrupts. \u201cYou just snog them.\u201d</p>\n<p>In that case \u2026 \u201cShall I, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Crowley says, distressed. \u201cSnogging\u2019s for humans, not demons. The closest demons generally get is eating somebody alive starting with the lips.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s not for demons, then it\u2019s <em> certainly </em> not for angels.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stare at each other in hopeless confusion.</p>\n<p>Right away, something begins to bubble up beneath the confusion, like freshly poured champagne dancing in a glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen again,\u201d says Crowley, \u201cwhat are we if not rule-breakers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefiers of convention,\u201d Aziraphale agrees, since it sounds better behaved.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite know how to do it,\u201d Crowley admits, grimacing. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t!\u201d Aziraphale says, scandalized.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d Crowley mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. <em> You </em> don\u2019t?\u201d Aziraphale has never asked -- it\u2019s not very angelic to inquire about such things -- but he\u2019s certainly assumed. \u201cYou always seem so \u2026 well, sexy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamned right I do. That\u2019s the demon swagger, thank you very much.\u201d Crowley looks a little flushed, Aziraphale notes with affection. \u201cBut I was demoning about, not going on dates with mortals. And I wasn\u2019t about to kiss another demon. Filthy buggers. If they haven\u2019t got a swarm of bugs around their head, there\u2019s a reptile sitting there. Imagine that: a reptile just sitting up there, watching the whole snog session.\u00a0Sticking its tail in your nostrils. Not bloody likely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Aziraphale says faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got <em> standards.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Aziraphale says, wondering if he should take the hint.</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant that at them,\u201d Crowley adds hastily. \u201cNot at you. You\u2019re gorgeous, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a very nerdy way, that is. In a way with a very stupid bowtie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Aziraphale says, pleased.</p>\n<p>Crowley drums his fingers on the dashboard, a thing he does when he\u00a0means to look casual, then says, \u201cI suppose there\u2019s a first time for everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd first times tend to go quite successfully,\u201d Aziraphale points out, \u201cwhen it\u2019s the two of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be totally unprecedented.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur specialty, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to happen. It can do nothing <em> except </em> happen. It feels as terrifyingly momentous as standing against hell at the end of the world, and somehow equally impossible to back down from.</p>\n<p>Then he takes in the look on Crowley\u2019s face: less like metaphorical champagne sparkling and more like he\u2019s just taken a swig from a bottle of rancid milk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that,\u201d Crowley says rather stiffly, \u201cI think I might have fancied you for the past six thousand years without ever thinking it\u2019d come to anything, and that fact is really hitting home now, and I think I might be petrified. Literally, I mean. Actually frozen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Six thousand years. Golly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSix-- <em> six </em> thousand?\u201d Aziraphale can\u2019t help asking.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the time you admitted to giving away the flaming sword. \u2018I love that,\u2019 I thought. \u2018I love this one; he\u2019s different.\u2019 That was it. Settled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDear Lord--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cByron,\u201d Crowley croaks tragically.</p>\n<p>\u201c--that was so fast of you. Then again, you are usually quick, aren\u2019t you? I really think it took me until the 1940s. And even then, I buried it straight away in a lot of denial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me. <em> I know. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look a bit green.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> feel </em> a bit bloody green.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we put a pin in it, then?\u201d Aziraphale asks, careful to hide his disappointment. \u201cTry it next \u2026 century?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley shakes his head barely.</p>\n<p>Right then.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale, quite possibly braver than any other angel in history, leans over the seat divide and carefully takes off Crowley\u2019s sunglasses. Crowley stares intently at him, his eyes -- eyes that once seemed eerie and inaccessible -- so beautiful in their exact Crowley-ness, and full of a feeling that Aziraphale recognizes completely.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale folds the sunglasses up and sets them aside. He knows how upset Crowley gets about his glasses getting damaged, never mind his stash of backup pairs.</p>\n<p>Once the glasses are safe, he leans in and presses his lips to Crowley\u2019s. For a moment, it\u2019s chaste and simple, the way people always used to greet one another before they turned so shy and germaphobic. Then -- extraordinarily, exquisitely, <em> blessedly </em> -- Crowley sparks to life and kisses back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Aziraphale says, smiling against Crowley\u2019s mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, angel,\u201d Crowley growls fondly, unfrozen now, and cups Aziraphale\u2019s face in his hands with all the world\u2019s reverence to pull him back in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knock on the window some ten minutes later. The angel and demon disentangle enough to roll down the rather foggy driver\u2019s side window.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy yes,\u201d Aziraphale says triumphantly, a little rumpled and incandescently gleeful, \u201cwe <em> are </em>a couple. And I think we\u2019ve just cracked French kissing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice,\u201d says the woman who\u2019s gotten out of her car to confront them, \u201cbut do you have to be snogging in the middle of the road?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a matter of fact--\u201d begins Crowley, with an edge to his voice that Aziraphale knows usually means he\u2019s going to shapeshift for a second into a terrifying hell beast.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Aziraphale says hastily. \u201cSo sorry, madam. We\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMadam?\u201d the woman says, frowning, as the car zooms off.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you believe that?\u201d Crowley complains as Aziraphale steers the Bentley down the lane. \u201cCan\u2019t even have a snog in the middle of the road without being interrupted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople these days,\u201d Aziraphale says, smiling as he shakes his head in mock dismay.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe worst,\u201d Crowley declares, the corner of his mouth curling up.</p>\n<p>And with that, Aziraphale drives them home.</p>\n<p>Well, to the next spot where they can pull over. They have quite a few years to make up for, after all, and there\u2019s no time like the present.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> The End </em>\n</p>"
