  "summary": "<p>...and they started singing Megan Thee Stallion. </p>\n<p>(Hitoshi, like any good friend, brainwashes Izuku\u2019s anxiety away for a day so he can know some peace. The problem? Izuku has no fear of god or consequences.</p>\n<p>Izuku also has no goddamn filter.)</p>",
  "notes": "<p>A gift for the queen of Chaos herself, Otaku6337.</p>\n<p>This was sparked by a prompt from DreamerKitten on Ota\u2019s discord that I borrowed with permission. I did take some stuff from Dreamer's and Luna-tic's ensuing conversation because it was hilarious and they have wonderful ideas. Thank you for letting me use this prompt! I was dying laughing in the discord. </p>\n<p>Originally this was going to be short, sweet, and to the point but it spiraled out of control.<br>(If I ever write anything under 1000 words, shoot me because I\u2019m apparently a pod person) </p>\n<p>Things to know: this is almost all in Hitoshi's POV. The names are a little weird but Hitoshi thinks/calls people by the names he's most comfortable using for them, even if he doesn't use that name when actually speaking about that person. </p>\n<p>This could be argued as OOC for Izuku but que sera sera. </p>\n<p>Also, fair warning: fans of Bakugou might not be super happy but I don't bash him (much). Then again, I don't think I've met a fan of Bakugou who doesn't want canon Deku to dunk on him a bit. Just a bit. </p>\n<p>tw: one minor homophobia mention from Mineta.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>I wrote this during Hitoshi levels of sleep deprivation and honestly it's some of my best work comedy-wise. That being said, please excuse any errors lol. The working title for this was \"unfiltered izuku: now with 100% less anxiety!\" </p>\n<p>I know Ectoplasm is canonically the math teacher but he never gets much love so I wanted him to be in this as the science teacher. We'll say Snipe is a math teacher, who knows what the hell he's usually doing. ALSO: I don't know science. </p>\n<p>You ever realize how much metaphorical weight you carry with anxiety or stress? Can you imagine that weight being completely and abruptly gone even if only for a day? Your brain would make you high on serotonin and endorphins. I just wanted to make a fun little story for Ota with some sass and chaos and then I thought about how it would actually work and here we are. A semi-high non-anxious Izuku with zero filters or even impulse control, lightly sprinkled with angst and crack.</p>\n<p>I'm headcanoning that Shouto \"supervises\" Hitoshi and Izuku hanging out because he doesn't quite get the whole love rival thing, and all three of them start spending a lot of time together especially during Hitoshi's insomnia episodes or Izuku's still occuring anxiety attacks (The boy gets meds and therapy but something things still happen to the poor bean). They end up all really liking spending time together. Hitoshi freaks out because he likes two people??? Him????? Shouto freaks out because he didn't know he could like the way someone naps or that he could stand to sit in silence comfortable with anyone but Izuku. Izuku freaks out because he doesn't want to ruin these friendships that he cherishes so much. lots of pining, lots of miscommunication, but they sort it out and all agree to date each other. It's very adorable. There's a lot of cat cafes and watching movies together.<br>(Also Bakugou gets therapy and Mineta gets expelled. The class is thriving *thumbs up*)</p>\n<p>Again, thanks to DreamerKitten for the idea!<br>Edited 4/4/21 to get rid of those weird double spaces around the formatted words.<br>As always, feedback is appreciated! &lt;3</p>",
  "text": "<p>Hitoshi was intimately familiar with the wrong side of 2:00AM. More often than not, he greeted the hour with all the affection of a second cousin twice removed who kept asking for a personal loan. But Hitoshi was broke and indifferent and couldn\u2019t really keep accepting these kinds of calls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait, where was he going with this? He\u2019s had about four hours of sleep over the last three days. He\u2019s so damn tired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Usually, his insomnia had him wandering the halls of his new dorm alone with the occasional side-shuffle past the enigma that was late night Tokoyami. Sometimes he\u2019d hear strange noises from one of the random rooms of his classmates but Hitoshi lives by the personal motto of \u201cnone of my business\u201d when it comes to social interactions. The creed of champions and anxious people everywhere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But tonight in particular, he has an accomplice to his crimes against restful sleep. He had hobbled into the common area as soon as his room became too oppressive and stumbled across a hyperventilating Izuku on the couch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So here he sits, shoulder to shoulder with one of the first real friends he made in this damn school, awkwardly guiding the shorter boy into a more reasonable breathing pattern. One that actually provided oxygen to the lungs. He highly recommends it. It takes a few minutes of wheezing before Izuku manages a characteristic apology and an even more characteristic heartfelt thanks. Like the fact that Hitoshi sitting beside him was a blessing to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like Hitoshi hadn\u2019t been in this exact same scenario two other times just this month.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNightmares again?\u201d He stops himself from rubbing Izuku\u2019s back like he was a small child. The urge was tempting but he could control himself <em>that </em>much at least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku blows out a harsh breath and scrubs at his face. When the sun rises, the dark circles under his eyes will be hidden and he\u2019ll be as energetic as ever. But here, next to his friend who conveniently matched the same shade of concealer as him, Hitoshi sees it all. The exhaustion, the panic, the stress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen isn\u2019t it nightmares?\u201d Izuku asks, more to chastise himself than actually ask Hitoshi because god knows, Hitoshi did not have the answer to that one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d He offers as always. They never really talk much when they have these informal Sleep-Deprived Anonymous meetings but it was the thought that counts. Izuku smiles, a little wobbly, but still pretty enough to be reassuring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hm. Wait. No, take it back, Hitoshi. Not pretty. Use your words. Different words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He blinks down at his hands and then reboots his mental systems. Izuku had already waved off his question when he was recalibrating so they sit in blissfully awkward silence for several long minutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d and oh, okay, Izuku was talking. Hitoshi could do the whole talking thing, \u201csometimes I wish I could scoop out my stupid brain and put something else in.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...like what?\u201d He asks. Izuku shrugs as best he can as he slouches against the back of the couch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA normal person's brain?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi joins him in slouching because that seems comfortable as hell right now. He cranes his head back until he feels the satisfying \u2018pop!\u2019 from his spine and wishes he could just become liquid. Izuku is not as calm next to him; calmer than before, yes, but his knee jitters at lightning speed. If Hitoshi didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think the other boy\u2019s quirk was active.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like I should say something about normal people's brains being overrated. You know, out of solidarity.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If asked to testify, Hitoshi would best describe the noise Izuku made as a \u201csnert.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNormal people get to sleep without almost dying over a presentation.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you were upset over?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku holds up a scarred hand and waves it side to side. \u201cKind of. I woke up from a bad dream and tried to practice my presentation for Midnight-sensei\u2019s class today but I stressed out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku mumbles something, chin to his chest, and Hitoshi squints. Everyone knows squinting increases your hearing capabilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The champion of bone-breaking obviously feels Hitoshi\u2019s confused stare because he looks up, pouts, then repeats a little louder, \u201cshe said I\u2019m bad at talking to people.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi blinks then blinks some more. Midnight told Midoriya--Mr. Uplifts Your Spirits, King of Forging Friendships and Rivalries, Sir \u201cIt\u2019s Your Power Todoroki\u201d--Izuku that he was bad at talking to people? This kid? The one who\u2019d have any villain spilling their life story with his Bambi eyes alone? The one who, if rumors are to be believed, turned a hero-hating kid into a fanboy and backtalked a serial killer in a fight? Multiple times?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He raises a single eyebrow in challenge. The brow says it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI get nervous for presentations or interviews,\u201d Izuku groans. He runs a hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, with everyone staring at you!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>do </em>get kind of rambly,\u201d Hitoshi concedes. He was there for the latest \u201cinterview practice\u201d the more social teachers put the students through. Izuku was a stuttering mess, but at least Todoroki\u2019s deadpan answers and Bakugou\u2019s rage were entertaining enough to balance out the painfully awkward parts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, it\u2019s the anxiety,\u201d he quips. Hitoshi automatically says a low \u201cmood\u201d but frowns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I noticed something. You act a lot different with me on nights like this than with anyone else. Your sass has been criminally underappreciated by your friends.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOur friends,\u201d Izuku says. Hitoshi lolls his head back and forth in what he hopes passes as agreement. He likes certain people out of the chaotic group of classmates he\u2019s been saddled with, he won\u2019t lie. Izuku\u2019s closest friends are alright though the main instigators of a lot of shit with no one being any wiser; always hilarious to witness firsthand. He likes talking with Kaminari and Jirou, they\u2019re both cool and they all share similar music tastes. Yaomomo is queen, period, but he\u2019s a little too intimidated to actually hold a meaningful conversation. He vibes with Shouji despite never having shared a single word which makes him respect the multi-armed teen even more. He\u2019s ambivalent to a lot of the others. Then there\u2019s the motherfuckers like Bakugou and Mineta that he\u2019d really rather not know personally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do they not get to experience the majesty that is your sheer disrespect and lame jokes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Izuku croaks. He cracks a grin before falling solemn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he starts. He brings a finger to his lips and mumbles away, Hitoshi too exhausted to catch any of it. The green-haired hero student catches himself and smiles sheepishly at his friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I feel more like myself with you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi exhales sharply because that was more of an emotional punch than he was prepared for. Feelings were icky at--<em> oh god </em>--3:47 AM.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the Dekusquad wants to actually know you, though. Nightmares and all.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku grimaces at the reminder of the name Ashido had dubbed their friend group several months ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey might. Or do. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m <em>lying </em>to them or anything. Shouto and I have had conversations like this before, but, well. With you, it\u2019s still different? Does that make sense? All of the bad parts in my head don\u2019t seem so bad. You\u2019d understand me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi gurgles in embarrassment. He throws his arm over his face and thanks the universe for the dark hiding his blush. How does one respond to that? <em>Your friends would understand? Ditto?</em> He chooses the tried and true method of avoidance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Midnight says you\u2019re bad with talking to people.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smushes his own cheeks in a self-soothing gesture while not looking over at the flustered transfer student who still had trouble accepting any kind of praise or positive encouragement. Hitoshi knew his flaws, okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am, at least for stuff like presentations. And with strangers. And for a grade. And when I\u2019m stressed. And--\u201d He tries to list more but Hitoshi takes the arm from over his face and lightly bonks the top of Izuku\u2019s head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine on your presentation. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s well thought out and researched which is more than I can say for like a third of us in class.\u201d Hitoshi\u2019s own presentation was on the symbolism of purple in hero art and costumes. He has an appropriate amount of star wipes in his slideshow and feels confident enough to pass. Knowing Izuku, there\u2019s a highly detailed, informative, and unfortunately color-coded novella that he\u2019ll try to stutter through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want the anxiety off for one day, I swear,\u201d Izuku moans despondently. His leg had never stopped jiggling at all throughout the entire conversation. Hitoshi is even more exhausted looking at the bouncing foot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi will admit, he hasn't been helped by a lot of people in his life, but when he is, he never forgets a debt. Aizawa is owed a blood pact and potentially his firstborn with how much support and training the hero provided him since the sports festival. Present Mic also gets his loyalty with his specialized lessons on improv and the vocal changing device on his costume. Izuku? He offered a hand up, encouraged Hitoshi\u2019s dream, then provided an incredibly detailed breakdown and training plan for his quirk. Hitoshi cannot and <em>will not </em>forget one of his first supporters. And well, all Izuku has asked for is his friendship, which feels more like Hitoshi still owing the other boy something, but Hitoshi wants to help where he can. So he sees a potential solution to Izuku\u2019s current problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can make that happen.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku cocks his head to the side, face still squished between his hands. Hitoshi nods in an attempt to look confident.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can brainwash your anxiety away for the day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you really do that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been getting a lot better at suggestions. Your notes are thorough. Aizawa\u2019s been having me practice.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku immediately lights up and tries to interrogate him on what all he\u2019s been working on but Hitoshi can keep a secret like a champion and will not be betraying Aizawa\u2019s trust. He values life. All of the teachers have been avoiding the teacher\u2019s lounge during a specific time every day without even realizing it. Aizawa gets his uninterrupted naps, Hitoshi gets his laughs and training, everyone\u2019s happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d really...do that for me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s tone is one Hitoshi\u2019s heard a few times after the more gruesome nightmares and ensuing panic attacks. When the other boy didn\u2019t want to talk but would still respond if Hitoshi needed to. Unsure if things were real or okay. Not confident in his welcome. Sometimes Hitoshi wonders about the bad parts of his brain that Izuku keeps talking about. They skirt around the darker parts of their issues but on rare occasions, Hitoshi can peer past the curtain. He hasn\u2019t made out the shape in the shadows but he\u2019s putting some pieces together when he\u2019s not still following the \u201cmind your business\u201d motto. What can he say, Izuku inspires some curiosity with his contradictions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tone is also one that prompts more of those--yuck--sentimental thoughts, so he shoots a lazy finger gun at Izuku and smirks. \u201cFree of charge, buddy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The teen chuckles, a little nervously, before biting his lip and adopting the trademark \u201csure, why the hell not\u201d look so many exhausted people owned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo for it. You\u2019d be a life-saver, at least for my art history grade.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I trust--\u201d Hitoshi snags him before he can say anything else sappy. This is why he usually wanders alone on late-night adventures. The emotion will make him break out in hives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He waves a hand in front of Izuku\u2019s face to make sure he\u2019s not pulling any bullshit with his own quirk and breaking out of control like the sports festival. Have they practiced with Izuku under Hitoshi\u2019s control since then? Yes. Would it make sense for Izuku to break out of a brainwashing he specifically agreed to? No. Will Hitoshi still check? Absolutely. Izuku is the ultimate wildcard, especially with quirk shenanigans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes remain blank. Hitoshi is almost tempted to leave him like this in order for the guy to relax for a second. But ultimately this experiment will give him a full day of relaxation. He knows which he would prefer if he was Izuku. Now that he\u2019s here, he doesn\u2019t want to half-ass it. Giving the class supernova a nice day is the least he can do, right? The teenager\u2019s been fighting off villains from day one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\"Once you go to sleep, you will stay asleep until your alarm. When you wake up, you will not experience any anxiety for twenty-four hours.\"</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The key to suggestive brainwashing, Hitoshi has found, is that he has to imbue his words with specific intent and focus. The command still runs in the back of the person\u2019s mind because it is working towards a goal, not an order. A key difference that Izuku had highlighted in his journal entry for him. Hitoshi pushes as much \u201cchill vibe\u201d and \u201cconfidence in public speaking\u201d as he can alongside the order. He has literally zero experience with the last one but he knows Izuku will appreciate it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then in a moment of pure insomniac genius, Hitoshi wings it and finishes with: \"<b>just be true to yourself.\"</b>\u00a0Like some kind of pop singer or mental health guru. But Izuku\u2019s already blinking when Hitoshi loosens the control so what\u2019s done is done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d The shorter boy asks. Hitoshi nods, suddenly weary with his quirk use at less-than-optimal conditions. His head hurts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wake up anxiety-free for the day.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa,\u201d Izuku breathes out with a trembling smile full of gratitude. \u201cThanks, Shinsou-kun. I really appreciate this. I\u2019ll go to bed, then. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi mentally pats himself on the back for helping out his <strike>pretty </strike>friend. Izuku heaves himself up with a soft, genuine smile and offers a tiny wave goodnight before heading to the stairwell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi watches him go and closes his eyes, still fused with the couch. He decides to catch whatever rest he can in the quiet common area and let the Hitoshi of tomorrow deal with his exhaustion. The Hitoshi of tomorrow has a confident Izuku to look forward to. The Hitoshi of that moment was finally giving in to the sweet siren call of sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019d be fine, right? Yeah.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019d be fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-.-.-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first clue that something is off the next morning is Izuku casually walking through the class door before the bell rings sans his tie. If the abomination he usually wore could legally be classified as a tie. The top button of his shirt is even open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His smile is almost euphoric as he quietly greets his friends in his path to his desk. Iida turns red while holding back his concerned dress code lecture as Aizawa strolls into the room with a thermos of coffee as big as his head. Lucky bastard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, sensei,\u201d the class dutifully greets with varying levels of enthusiasm. Aizawa simply grunts and nods before cracking his shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, we have some announcements.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa reels off their updated training schedule for the week, a request from Lunch Rush to not throw fish cakes at each other in the cafeteria (again), and a joint training session the school is setting up with Ketsubetsu Academy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last announcement is met with excited cheers. In the midst of the class yelling questions about details and issuing vague threats to people who aren\u2019t even in the room, Mineta rubs his hands together and bleats, \u201cI bet they\u2019ll have a ton of babes. We need some fresh eye candy around here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Mineta?\u201d Izuku asks, turning in his chair to face the pervert behind him while Aizawa demands the class to calm down. \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A pin dropping at that moment would be as loud as a gunshot. The class stares in shock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya!\u201d Iida yelps after coming to his senses. \u201cLanguage!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Izuku pulls a contrite face and turns back to Mineta before speaking in perfect English, \"s<b>hut the fuck up.\"</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi, who was already half-asleep since the first bell rang, chokes on air at the sharp pronunciation. Aizawa stares down his number one nuisance with such an incredulous look Hitoshi might wonder if he was having an aneurysm. Iida sure looked like he was experiencing one. Hitoshi watches in fascinated horror as Izuku nods once at Mineta\u2019s slack-jawed self and turns to patiently look at their homeroom teacher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Hitoshi is pretty sure that came from Kaminari. \u201cDude,\u201d Kirishima breathes in either awe or fear. Hard to tell. He too cannot decide on what to feel in front of the oncoming trainwreck. He abruptly realizes that he may have made a mistake last night in the most entertaining way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa pinches the bridge of his nose and visibly prays for patience. Hitoshi has seen that stance many times during training and wholeheartedly sympathizes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you now, problem child?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want the list chronologically or alphabetically?\u201d Izuku fires back, pleasant as anything. Bakugou abruptly turns around in his desk chair to scowl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Deku?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku slowly breaks eye contact to look Bakugou up and down. Then huffs and looks back at the teacher in dismissal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi has never seen anything sexier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait, no. Stop that, brain. This is not the time. It\u2019s crisis mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou gargles out what passes as a scream but Aizawa\u2019s Erasure and the threat of the capture weapon bring the blond from a raging boil to a dangerous simmer. Smoke starts to curl from his hands but Aizawa ignores it with practiced ease and continues his interrogation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you under the effects of a quirk?\u201d Oh god, Hitoshi was <em>so </em>in for it as the quirk effect in question. He didn\u2019t know what weapon he was releasing upon his unsuspecting class but maybe if he was nice and repentant, they\u2019d show him some mercy?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, technically.\u201d Izuku folds his hands in front of him, eyes crinkling as he smiles happily. Hitoshi wheezes into his palms, distressed. He knew Aizawa looked at him, he just knew it. Hopefully the rest of the class whispering or choking on scared laughter covered for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to elaborate?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I need to?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A pause that lasted way too long for Hitoshi\u2019s sanity. He can almost see the exact moment their teacher decides that no, actually, today is <em>not </em>the day to handle any shenanigans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf,\u201d he grits out, \u201cyou\u2019re not hurt or experiencing any negative side effects, then no. Are you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d Izuku pops the \u201cp\u201d in an adorably annoying way. Is Aizawa\u2019s eye twitching? Hitoshi is still too nervous to look up from hiding his face. He\u2019d bet good money his mentor\u2019s eye was twitching.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright...let a teacher know if you <em> do </em> have any issues.\u201d And with that phrase, Aizawa has washed his hands of the problem child for the moment. Hitoshi knows he would kill to protect any of his students, but he\u2019d also kill to have a vacation from the havoc they tend to wreak. Izuku smiles, expression still a little looser than normal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, sensei, you\u2019re the best,\u201d he chirps. Actually chirps. Hitoshi is getting emotional whiplash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re just going to ignore him telling me to shut up?\u201d Mineta chimes in. The entire class shuts him down with a \u201cyes.\u201d Even Kouda was nodding. Izuku yawns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Aizawa stresses the word, \u201cwe will have more details about the joint training session next week but it will take the second half of the day on Thursday. If you have any other questions, just. Ask me later. For now, stay quiet and don\u2019t cause a scene.\u201d He side-eyes the still smoking Bakugou who scowls.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The underground hero then proceeds to carefully place his thermos on the desk and crawl into his sleeping bag to pass the rest of homeroom period in a mental health recovery nap. Half of the class immediately wants to join. The other half pounces. Bakugou growls and hunches over his desk. Hitoshi valiantly tries to ignore the increasingly louder questions from Iida and Kirishima by closing his eyes and pretending he was somewhere far, far away from the chaos. He knows deep in his bones this was only the beginning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya, are you alright? If this quirk is affecting you we should head to Recovery Girl!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoribro that was so manly! What kind of quirk is it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, Midoriya, this is so weird.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get hit by a quirk?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-kun, as much as it is warranted otherwise, we should try to treat our fellow students with respect! We are hero students after all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-sensei didn\u2019t seem to care,\u201d is the first thing Izuku says during the inquisition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless, we must act to an exemplary standard. I believe the quirk you are influenced by has hampered your usual demeanor but rest assured, we as a class will help. We can find another tie for you as well--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much about the tie, Iida-kun.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dress code is important, Midoriya-kun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter when Kacchan doesn\u2019t wear his. You talk to him sometimes but it never sticks. Besides, I don\u2019t know if what I do to my tie actually complies with dress code,\u201d he snorts derisively at himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a little, um, wonky sometimes, dude.\u201d Kaminari chuckles nervously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tie it and I didn\u2019t want to struggle with it today. I never had a dad to teach me the proper method and by the time I\u2019d gotten comfortable enough with a father figure to ask, my hand doesn\u2019t want to work as it should.\u201d Izuku holds up his scarred and slightly crooked fingers while he rambles. \u201cSo if no one usually has a problem with it, the tie isn\u2019t a big deal today, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Iida stutters over the word as his metaphorical engine stalls. The other nearby students shuffle awkwardly in place. \u201cIt\u2019s important--\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku sighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIida-kun, you\u2019re one of my best friends and I treasure you greatly, but please don\u2019t lecture me about inconsequential rules when you\u2019re the first and only one here to attempt murder.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cClass prez? <em> Murder? </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d Todoroki murmurs to himself beneath the yelling. Hitoshi only hears because his desk is right next to the heterochromatic teen. He\u2019s overheard a lot of interesting non-sequiturs from his deskmate and honestly? This wasn\u2019t even top ten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSoft same.\u201d Oh, that\u2019s Uraraka who\u2019s standing close to their desks. She\u2019d typically be one of the first checking in on Izuku but it seems her danger sense is top-tier because she immediately backed away from the ticking time bomb that was surrounding the green-haired boy. She watches in amusement as Ashido and Kaminari turn to Iida and ask what looks like extremely prying questions. Their class president stammers out excuses, face bright red and bad at lying. Izuku is also watching in amusement as the interrogation shifts away from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku with his damn sixth sense must feel all three of them staring because he glances over and fucking <em> winks</em>. His curly hair is as wild as usual and a smirk plays on his lips. Uraraka squeaks and Todoroki freezes in place. Hitoshi hunches his shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he groans in gay panic. \u201cOh noooooo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <em> what\u2019s </em>going on?\u201d Uraraka asks. She\u2019s looking straight at Hitoshi. Damn observant people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he tries. A dangerous glint enters the girl\u2019s eyes. \u201cOkay, okay! Look, um.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki and Uraraka listen in fascination as Hitoshi quietly explains Izuku worrying over his presentation the previous night and his offer to brainwash him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really only to relax him so he wouldn\u2019t stress over his grade today. I was not expecting <em>that</em>. Whatever that is.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were just trying to help,\u201d Todoroki comforts him with all of the verbal emotion of wet cardboard. For a boy who has slowly been growing into social awareness the past year, he still isn\u2019t the best at reassurance but Hitoshi will take what he can get. Uraraka nods sympathetically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI should see if I can override the command.\u201d Hitoshi sighs.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you even un-brainwash someone?\u201d Todoroki asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Why\u2019?\u201d He repeats incredulously. He manfully ignores the doubt in Todoroki\u2019s question. \u201cWe\u2019re not even a half-hour into the school day and Aizawa-sensei has already given up from Midoriya\u2019s aura <em>alone</em>. I know how this is going to play out. Hint: there will be tears.\u201d Mostly his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just took away his anxiety for the day, right? That\u2019s a <em> nice </em>thing to do. Stopping it now is a little mean,\u201d she tries to explain. He understands. He doesn\u2019t like the thought of bringing Izuku\u2019s anxiety and stress back either. Izuku deserves a day off from his demons and the idea of inviting them right back into his head leaves a bad taste in Hitoshi\u2019s mouth. (Nevermind the fact that he maybe sort of isn\u2019t sure how to do it anyway, but damn it. He\u2019s going to be a hero. He has to <em> try </em> to stop collateral damage.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit, this would be nice of me if I hadn\u2019t fucked up. Okay? It\u2019s not just anxiety. I suggested that he be true to himself too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, this is true to himself?\u201d Uraraka startles. She seems conflicted, wondering if what she\u2019s known about her friend has been a lie. Todoroki continues to stare at Izuku but this time in contemplation. Izuku moves on from the crowd in front of him and focuses on his ever-present notebook, enthusiastically writing what Hitoshi is sure are world domination plans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is Midoriya without any inhibitions,\u201d Todoroki states. \u201cHe\u2019s still him but less\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNervous?\u201d She finishes as he trails off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFucked up?\u201d Hitoshi offers. Uraraka swats at him without a glance in his direction. Ow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...I was going to say desperate to make everyone like him but that seemed too mean.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The three pause for a second. Uraraka pouts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s...kind of accurate though. Aw. Deku.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI really feel like I should stop this,\u201d Hitoshi mutters. He\u2019s conflicted. No matter what he does at this point he\u2019d be a little guilty. Bring back Izuku\u2019s anxiety after promising to help? Or let Izuku\u2019s unfiltered brain roam unsupervised and make the boy deal with the fallout?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka gently places a hand on his shoulder. Her face is determined and bright.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. No, let it play out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is abruptly reminded that this is the same group of friends who went off to save a kidnapped classmate with only some discount disguises. They all regularly pushed themselves past the point of exhaustion out of some weird cycle of encouragement and empowerment. Uraraka herself flung herself across cities with zero gravity to punch people in the face while laughing. None of them were remotely normal. They thrived in the chaos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tsuyu is the only sane one in the Dekusquad, he swears. He needs to buy her a fruit basket or something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gapes at Uraraka for a long moment, trying to figure out how to organize his thoughts beyond blue-screening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually freaking out about this.\u201d Todoroki still has yet to look away from Izuku\u2019s back even as he talks to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi clasps his hands together and presses them to his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand. You both should know how much trouble Midoriya can get into on a regular day.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...you have a point.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Todoroki says blandly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen. He is a sarcastic little shit with a heart of gold, a genius brain, and enough anxiety to nerf God. I just took away the last one. You realize that I may have doomed us all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka hums doubtfully. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll get that bad.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki interrupts. His eyes are distant, remembering something fondly based on the soft smile on his usually impassive face. \u201cNo, it\u2019ll get pretty bad.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finally looks back over to Hitoshi with passionate confidence. \u201cWe\u2019ll still let it happen.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maniacs, all of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d If Izuku was upset at his own behavior when he woke up tomorrow, Hitoshi would not be the only one complicit. He can at least say he put up a token protest and tried to stop it. Part of him wants to take this whole day back and keep it from going too off the rails. Protect his friend\u2019s dignity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other part (the one that may make him an unofficial Dekusquad member) thinks it\u2019d be nice to have some popcorn for the show.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no helping it!\u201d Uraraka says. She waves to catch Tsuyu\u2019s attention across the room from where she was talking to Jirou and Tokoyami. She beckons the frog girl to join them and while Tsuyu gets up--a surprising Jirou following--Uraraka bounces over to the small group standing near Izuku.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDisperse!\u201d Uraraka channels her inner Iida and chops the air dramatically. She grabs said boy by the arm and drags him away. Kirishima, Kaminari, and Ashido pout at losing their source of answers before turning to a tetchy Bakugou and bemused Sero.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so!\u201d The girl starts when Iida, Tsuyu, and Jirou are standing around Todoroki\u2019s and Shinsou\u2019s desks. Wait, when did Yaoyorozu show up? He hadn\u2019t seen her approach but she was suddenly there next to Jirou with a concerned look on her face, glancing at Izuku who was only a few desks away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need to worry. Deku\u2019s going to be fine! He had asked Shinsou-kun to brainwash him for something and it\u2019s only going to last the day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he starts. Jirou smirks and says, \u201cI already heard. This is funny as hell.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, if Jirou already eavesdropped, he has no doubt Shouji also knows the situation. Luckily the two people with the quirks best suited to information gathering were chill and could keep their damn mouths shut. Hagakure, the other stealth expert, was a little too gossipy for Hitoshi\u2019s personal tastes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWill Midoriya really be fine?\u201d Iida asks, completely tense. <em> Will this really only last a day? </em> Hitoshi hears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s only for twenty-four hours.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s <em>already </em>fine,\u201d Uraraka reassures. Iida\u2019s still flushed and slightly chagrined face says otherwise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy twenty-four?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the longest I\u2019ve seen it hold.\u201d At least for a one-time thought implant. He hasn\u2019t gotten the exact science down yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s it possible you can brainwash anxiety away, anyway?\u201d Jirou asks in a low voice. Hitoshi shrugs, not willing to disclose the full details of his suggestive brainwashing training. Tsuyu and Yaoyorozu immediately understand like the queens they are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo <em> that\u2019s </em>what happened, kero.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just have to power through and support Deku!\u201d Uraraka cheers. Iida\u2019s already frowning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a way to reverse the effect?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d She firmly denies. Like the chaotic liar she apparently is. Hitoshi\u2019s a little impressed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jirou--sensible, down-to-earth Jirou--raises an eyebrow at him in mock skepticism but then shrugs and accepts Uraraka\u2019s statement. She <em>just heard </em>how he\u2019s currently feeling about this whole mess and apparently has decided to just go with the flow. Like he\u2019s not concerned for the mental well-being of the school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want Deku-kun to be happy and relaxed?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I suppose.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi tries not to snort. He doubts relaxation will be the end result. Iida is certainly not relaxed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that you can do this, Shinsou-kun!\u201d Yaoyorozu praised. \u201cThough I must say, maybe it\u2019s more plausible that your quirk has ordered Midoriya-kun to act a certain way than altering a chemical imbalance. I\u2019d love to discuss it more.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re able to just turn anxiety off, you should talk to the business department about selling your services, kero,\u201d Tsuyu says. Teases? Wait, is she teasing him or is she honestly offering advice? Some pocket change would be nice but it sounded like a lot more work and socializing that he really wants to deal with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically Shinsou-kun\u2019s quirk is just <em> suppressing </em> certain chemicals in my brain.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice startles all eight students by suddenly cutting into their conversation. \u201cMy body is following the command even if I\u2019m not consciously able to do so. It\u2019s an interesting sensation. Honestly, I feel a little high.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The green-haired teenager looks over at them from his desk with a peaceful expression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...how much did you hear?\u201d Hitoshi asks, shocked. Izuku just grins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHomeroom\u2019s ending.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bell rings at that exact second and Aizawa is already inching along the floor in his sleeping bag. Hitoshi watches the demented caterpillar escape with jealousy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cementoss\u2019 lecture is as dry as usual. Hitoshi actually loves reading and languages but some of the literature their teacher picks for class could be written off as a medical sleep aid. Nothing against the hero at all, Hitoshi certainly respects the guy, but he\u2019d engage more students with something other than the book equivalent of plain wheat toast.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entire first period passes with zero incident except for the occasional glance at Izuku. The teen\u2019s shoulders are completely tension-free but his posture isn\u2019t his usual hunch over his desk. He\u2019s leaning back in his chair and taking notes at the world\u2019s most casual speed of light. Hitoshi swears he sees green sparks from Izuku\u2019s hands but the rest of his body remains unhurried.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second period starts with Ectoplasm collecting their papers on biology and DNA for this module of their science class. He begins his lecture as usual, discussing mutation quirks and genetics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho can tell me what makes a mutation quirk biologically different from any other quirk?\u201d Izuku immediately shoots his hand up and the teacher calls on him.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles and waves his hands emphatically as he speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting, sensei! There are different levels of mutation quirks that have been studied, and the general scientific consensus assumes that these differences can be traced along the DNA from a person\u2019s genomes. Most non-mutated quirks don\u2019t have the same genome sequencing. It varies for every individual, of course, but there\u2019s a noticeable sequencing difference between someone with an overall quirk mutation like Tsuyu-chan or Ojiro-kun\u2019s quirks and mutations that occur alongside the development of the quirk factor, like Tokoyami-kun or Hagakure-chan\u2019s!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, I don\u2019t have a mutation quirk,\u201d says the invisible girl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are <em>literally </em>unable to see you,\u201d Izuku points out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB-But the quirk analyst in elementary said I had an emitter quirk that was just always active.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHagakure-chan, no,\u201d Izuku tilts his head, \u201cthat analyst was a certifiable idiot. If you had an emitter quirk, Aizawa-sensei would be able to turn you visible when he erased it. But since he can\u2019t affect your quirk factor beyond restricting your light flash attacks you obviously have a physical mutation as well as a quirk factor. Just because you can manipulate one part of your quirk as if it was an emitter does not classify the full scope of your abilities the same way. Your quirk is light refraction mutanism, please update your paperwork and tell me the name of that analyst so we can publicly shame them.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Hagakure tries to say but just ends up squeaking. They can\u2019t see her hands but her sleeves are flailing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...alright then.\u201d Ectoplasm clears his throat. \u201cDo you have anything else to add, Midoriya?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly that the prevailing misconception about mutation quirks stem from being under-researched and that speaking on a cellular level, every quirk is a mutation quirk as it physically mutates some part of the brain or body in order to activate the quirk. We simply classify quirks based on their attributes or functions and have found these minor genetic differences between emitter, mental, and physical mutation quirks to further establish said differences. Of course, as I said, there is a standard deviation in a person\u2019s DNA when they have a visible mutation quirk versus something like telekinesis. More research is needed to truly understand the development of these physical mutations in the womb since other quirks tend to \u201cactivate\u201d around a certain age, but more scientists are veering away from mutation studies due to growing quirkist beliefs,\u201d Izuku infodumps. \u201cAlso the chapter on hereditary quirk genetics in the textbook is wrong. I can bring you the corrections, sensei.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, tell \u2018em,\u201d Sero breathes out in the stunned silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ectoplasm stands in place for several long seconds before sighing, nodding once, and continuing the lesson. He doesn\u2019t call on Izuku for the remaining period.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their next class is English but as they\u2019re bracing for the sheer vibrancy of Present Mic, they\u2019re greeted with Aizawa\u2019s defeated stare when he comes through the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is Mic-sensei?\u201d Ojiro raises his hand. Aizawa blinks at him for a second before sighing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idiot tried to come into work feeling sick. He\u2019s been sent home to rest, so we\u2019re covering his classes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he alright?\u201d asks Jirou, who's made no secret that Present Mic is her favorite teacher and role model. Aizawa nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRecovery Girl said it was a simple stomach bug and he should be fine with rest and medicine. He\u2019ll be back in tomorrow.\u201d Several teens sigh in relief, Hitoshi joining in quietly. As a rule, he doesn\u2019t like loud people even if he\u2019s surrounded by them, but Present Mic is an honest and kind teacher who is gentle with the quieter members of their class. He\u2019s Hitoshi\u2019s second favorite adult in the school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoyama also raises his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to teach us English, sensei?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Aizawa responds immediately. Hitoshi knows the hero is fluent in English--whether from his own studies or just osmosis through his best friend, he\u2019s not sure. He has the qualifications to give them an English lesson.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...then why are you the one substituting, Aizawa-sensei?\u201d Izuku asks, straight-forward. Iida almost flinches at the perceived rudeness. Aizawa pointedly does not look at Izuku and just grunts out, \u201cthis will be a self-study period\u201d and shakes out his sleeping bag.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi smirks at his mentor treating this opportunity as another naptime. Izuku chuckles as well. The class collectively sweat-drops when Aizawa disappears behind the podium. Then immediately scrambles to do everything but study with the free time they\u2019ve been miraculously given. Hitoshi debates napping as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku stretches and Hitoshi does <em>not </em>look. The green-haired boy stands from his desk and walks over to Hagakure with a leisurely pace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHagakure-chan, I was serious about checking up on your paperwork. There\u2019s also a lot of resources I can provide you about a dual emitter-mutant quirk.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Midoriya-kun!\u201d She says with an awkward chuckle. She fidgets in place. \u201cThough I\u2019m not sure how to feel about my quirk being completely wrong after all of these years.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku, who probably would\u2019ve apologized profusely and stammered on a usual day, just shrugs and nods. \u201cUnderstandable. Let me know if you have any questions, okay? Having to suddenly understand changes to your quirk can be daunting.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anyone would know, it\u2019s the boy wonder himself who kept revealing new aspects of his quirk in what felt like every other training session.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima bounds up to the boy, interrupting whatever Hagakure was about to reply with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Midori-bro, that was awesome earlier! Do you think you can analyze my quirk too? Please?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, me too!\u201d Ashido adds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI...I would like to know as well,\u201d Tokoyami quietly states.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku <em>lights up</em>. He goes to his bag and pulls out a notebook before returning, flips it open, and cracks his knuckles. \u201cI thought you\u2019d <em>never</em> ask.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What proceeds is the politest and most helpful smackdown Hitoshi has ever witnessed. He excuses himself from <em>that </em>party. It wouldn\u2019t matter much since he\u2019d gotten recent updates for his quirk analysis just two weeks ago per one long-winded text in the middle of the night. Then again, Izuku might have even more to add but Hitoshi is content to simply watch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku flies through compliments without a hint of shame, praising his classmates\u2019 techniques and abilities. He\u2019s enthusiastic about Kirishima\u2019s unbreakable mode, Kaminari\u2019s new directional gear, Tokoyami\u2019s flight ability by using Dark Shadow. He goes through all of his classmates surrounding him as they gravitate towards the group, Bakugou scoffing by himself in a corner and Mineta blatantly ignored by everyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Izuku goes straight for the jugular, or the heart of his curiosity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He points out flaws in Kirishima\u2019s fighting style and the openings he leaves. \u201cAlso actually look into protective gear for your costume. I get that shirts might be restrictive with your quirk but you won\u2019t always be able to react to a sneak attack and an exposed chest just screams<em> attack me </em> to villains.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s enthusiastically nodding when Izuku grabs his hands. \u201cAlso, please stop saying everything is manly. Please. I don\u2019t think I have the time to really dive into gender identity and pigeonholing yourself or others into certain masculine stereotypes as a personality trait <em> but </em> remind me to lend you some books later.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKaminari-kun, you cannot go for the all-out attack as it leaves you vulnerable. Aizawa-sensei was right that it is difficult to save others if you are capacitated and I think you could also benefit from that advice. Have you tried capacitors or limiters so you don\u2019t overload? Like batteries? Maybe work on your physical combat abilities instead of your quirk so you can effectively tase people? Your close-range capabilities are somewhat lacking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOjiro-kun, seriously look into weaponry. Maybe a gun. Villains are expecting to watch for your tail or your fighting style but they won\u2019t expect a bullet or knife. You always need an advantage with a physical mutation such as yours. You\u2019re intuitive and with a little practice you could be very efficient as an apprehension hero.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMomo-chan I mean this in the nicest, least-Mineta-way possible but you need to both eat more and change your costume. There are so many weaknesses. You don\u2019t have enough fat stores to properly use your quirk especially with the larger scale canons you\u2019re fond of, which, we\u2019ll get to later. But without those extra lipids, you\u2019ll find yourself running low in a drawn-out battle. Also, you know support can make a costume with your DNA so your creations will phase through the fabric instead of having to take your shirt off? Actually, Hagakure-chan, did you know that about your own costume? Here, let me give you Hatsume Mei\u2019s phone number. I swear, no one cares about durability or underage protection laws--\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least half the class receives a thorough analysis that balances both their strengths and smacktalks their weaknesses. Hitoshi spots their classmates honestly taking notes or writing down Izuku\u2019s suggestions in a stupor. At least, when they\u2019re not staring into space completely blind-sided or questioning their life choices. Kirishima and Kaminari in particular are flabbergasted and scrambling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of the other teenagers receive seemingly random comments or weird questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think if you concentrated on a light enough PH level, you could make acid that causes hallucination? Like a literal acid trip?\u201d He asks Ashido who lights up. Hitoshi can almost feel Aizawa\u2019s migraine from here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you control Principal Nedzu?\u201d He asks Kouda who blinks rapidly. \u201cSince he\u2019s also an animal? He has intelligence but your quirk is essentially brainwashing animals. Do they remember what you asked them to do? Do they have opinions on it? You\u2019re very kind and polite so I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t care but have you tried on animals with quirks? Do you think Principal Nedzu could communicate with you without the human language?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to measure your strength both on sugar and off sugar. Oh, and with different types of sugar too! For science!\u201d He demands of Sato who can only nod, perturbed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He literally walks up to Shouji\u2019s desk and pouts. \u201cYou\u2019re too tall and honestly I\u2019m offended,\u201d which causes everyone to laugh. Shouji, in an unprecedented move, simply stands and offers Izuku a hug. The shorter boy squints his eyes but accepts, hugging back. Shouji wraps six arms around Izuku and gently squeezes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi knows how Izuku feels about hugs, weirdly touch-starved that he is. He shudders the tiniest bit but if anyone notices, no one says anything. Shouji holds the boy for a few seconds longer. Izuku clears his throat, a little confused but happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m not offended anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka and Hagakure giggle, a few others chuckling too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouji just releases Izuku and crinkles his eyes, smiling behind his mask. He returns to his seat as Izuku narrows in on Aoyama, saying something about cheese consumption and low-level lactose intolerance, but Hitoshi narrows in as Shouji leans back in his chair, the mouth on his arm almost smirking. He notices both Tokoyami and Hitoshi looking at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHugging always calms down short people.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dark Shadow peeks out beneath Tokoyami\u2019s cape and cackles while Hitoshi snorts. The rest of the students surrounding Izuku laugh and talk amongst themselves, still keeping everyone close by. Shouji\u2019s shoulders shake in silent laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi thinks having friends suits the other boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTokoyami! I have so many questions about you and Dark Shadow, you have no idea.\u201d Izuku approaches after leaving Aoyama sparkling but a little green in the face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will do our best to assist,\u201d the bird-headed boy says solemnly. \u201cYour guidance is greatly appreciated.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dark Shadow grins at Izuku. \u201cWhat Fumi said!\u201d They screech loudly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStupid,\u201d Bakugou huffs and mutters under his breath but still characteristically loud. \u201cWho the fuck even cares about Deku\u2019s bullshit?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dark Shadow scowls and Izuku pauses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Kacchan, acting like a dick won't make yours any bigger, so shut the fuck up unless you've got something constructive to say.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Ashido whisper-screams. Bakugou immediately stands up, apoplectic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima places a strong hand on Bakugou\u2019s shoulder who violently shrugs it off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not start a fight,\u201d Aizawa intones from behind the podium. \u201cI will expel all of you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the class hold their breath while Bakugou vibrates angrily for long, long seconds. Kirishima hovers nearby while the blond takes deep breaths and scowls at his desk. Izuku watches placidly as Bakugou huffs, digs in his bag, and pulls out headphones. He turns on music and folds his arms like the ornery bastard he is. Hitoshi spares a second to remind himself how little he actually cares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi also marks a tally for his mentor: Aizawa is obviously checked out from whatever he thinks is happening with Izuku to spare his remaining sanity but hey. He hadn\u2019t stopped the verbal humiliation, only Bakugou\u2019s meltdown. He\u2019s been telling Izuku that Aizawa is secretly sadistic and laughs at their pain for a while now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Izuku never doubted him but it\u2019ll be nice to have yet another example.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku enthusiastically starts asking questions to both Tokoyami and Dark Shadow once it\u2019s clear Bakugou won\u2019t interrupt again. He lulls a bit when he\u2019s distracted by writing their answers down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you do this for everyone you meet?\u201d Jiro asks, fascinated at the full notebook still in Izuku\u2019s hands. She\u2019s sitting on Ashido\u2019s desk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. I started analyzing hero fights so I have a lot more heroes and villains than people we know, but all of your quirks are so interesting I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of heroes do you have? Do you have Crimson Riot?\u201d Kirishima\u2019s sparkling so much in excitement that Aoyama looks a little impressed. Izuku flips through his notebook.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi sees Todoroki startle out of the corner of his eye. There\u2019s a mad scramble to his pocket and to pull out his phone. The other boy surreptitiously glances between his phone and Izuku for several seconds before he props the phone up against his notebook, camera facing the other boy, and turns to Hitoshi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou, I need a favor.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi raises his eyebrow. The last time Todoroki asked someone for a favor there were a dozen exploded eggs all over the dorm kitchen. \u201cYeah?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you ask Midoriya what he thinks of Endeavor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour <em> dad?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The disgusted nose scrunch that Todoroki responds with only lasts a nanosecond but speaks volumes. Hitoshi prides himself on being able to read people (he\u2019s worked hard on learning psycho-analyzation skills to get even the most hard-headed idiots to respond) so he\u2019s always known Todoroki has some kind of issue with his family. Who wouldn\u2019t with a famous and famously hot-headed father? But the look on his face makes Hitoshi wonder just what kind of issues might actually be going on. Then again, not his personal business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll maybe, possibly do some digging though. Insomnia leads to all kinds of late-night research binges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just ask Midoriya yourself if you really want to know?\u201d He asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki looks away. Is that a blush? Can the thermodynamic wonder even do that?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would consider it a favor if you could ask for me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Huh.</em> \u201cAlright, not like it\u2019s a big deal for me.\u201d <em>Like it apparently is for you,</em> he wants to say but refrains. He tries to curb some of his more asshole tendencies around his classmates. Well, explodo-boy and sour-grapes as the exceptions. Besides, this is simple enough to do for his quiet desk neighbor and Hitoshi thinks he should maybe rack up some karma before the day is over, if just to balance out what he\u2019s caused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Midoriya?\u201d He catches Izuku\u2019s attention. \u201cHow about Endeavor?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>More than one person quickly looks over at Todoroki, who immediately schools his face into pleasant neutrality. A pause in the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The meanest smile Hitoshi has ever witnessed spreads across Izuku\u2019s lips. And Hitoshi was bullied for several years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOhoho,\u201d Izuku suddenly chortles like a deranged man. \u201cI fucking hate the bitch.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-kun!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDaaaaaamn.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo tell, mon ami.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi realizes he may have unleashed a beast. Their classmates only continue to feed it. Izuku proceeds to dismantle the former number two hero systematically and without mercy. Hitoshi forces himself to look away from the angrily gesturing Izuku to the rest of the class who are slowly listening with shock and horror. He\u2019d never liked Endeavor much as a hero, too used to brute force, and if Aizawa\u2019s stories are true, too disparaging towards underground and support heroes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku himself outlines several instances of Endeavor not working with a team or respecting other heroes. How rude and aloof he could be towards victims and fans alike. He actually quotes news footage and interviews of the man, calling him a \u201cnarcissistic garbage dump who took the trash and decided to spew it from his mouth.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Endeavor\u2019s property damage numbers are astronomically high. His criminal injury rate is even higher. \u201cHe\u2019s as destructive as the number of villains captured in Japan in the last seven months combined. I have a whole spreadsheet. It\u2019s an honest wonder how he hasn\u2019t been arrested.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this,\u201d Yaoyorozu exclaims, horrified. Iida has a scandalized hand pressed to his face. Kouda is <em>scowling. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Todoroki, are you okay?\u201d Sero asks. He\u2019s awkward and just as disgusted as the rest of the class but is kind enough to check in on the other boy who is startled out of his dreamy mooning over Izuku.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of this is really a surprise if I am honest.\u201d Todoroki lifts one shoulder in a half-shrug while everyone stares at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of this is public knowledge, you just have to look for it,\u201d Izuku points out. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s a lot of heroes out there that have horrible records with no consequences. Something needs to be done but too much is swept under the rug for limelight heroes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what Stain was saying?\u201d Kaminari asks then immediately tenses when both Izuku and Iida turn to glare. Jirou swats his arm. \u201cShit, sensitive topic. I\u2019m sorry, Iida.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The class president visibly composes himself. \u201cAs we\u2019ve discussed before, I can somewhat understand Stain\u2019s ideals and appeal. I accept your apology, Kaminari-kun.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Izuku mutters. Kaminari squeaks in fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-kun, it\u2019s alright. My brother would not want me to be petty over a classmate\u2019s words.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh, Iida, </em> Hitoshi thinks. <em> Your brother isn\u2019t here right now.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can almost visibly see Izuku agree with that thought as he frowns and turns back to Kaminari.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStain was narrow-sighted and stupid. He in no way tried to actually change anything. He was a killer for killing's sake and whatever grand plan he thought he had would\u2019ve imploded in his noseless fucking face if he used an ounce of logic.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The electric quirk user meeps. \u201cI don\u2019t, um\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Izuku starts passionately talking about the concepts of psychopathic prejudices and the fallacy of being judge, jury, and executioner with implicit bias, Hitoshi zones out and tries not to fluster himself. He hears \u201cgave a bad name to vigilantism\u201d and \u201cAll Might fanboy gone rabid\u201d (which is painfully ironic to hear from Izuku, not that Hitoshi would ever say that out loud). He glances over at Todoroki who is not paying attention to the discussion about the literal serial killer he\u2019d encountered but instead smiling softly at his phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWorth it?\u201d He mumbles to Todoroki out of curiosity. The other boy nods. Hitoshi raises an eyebrow and nods at the phone. \u201cWhy\u2019d you record that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bluntly as ever, Todoroki simply turns the phone to show Hitoshi a group chat, saying, \u201cI wanted my siblings to experience it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi has literally nothing to say beyond more questions, this time about Todoroki\u2019s mental state, so he just glances over the texts. A \u201cFuyumi\u201d has sent several lines of emojis, many of which are laughing or crying. A \u201cNatsuo\u201d has at least three keysmashes. A new group of texts pops up as Hitoshi is reading.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Natsuo:</b> god damn greenie go off</p>\n<p><b>Natsuo:</b> shouto marry that boy</p>\n<p><b>Natsuo: </b>or i will</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi snorts when Todoroki reads that. He leans on his hands and unfocuses his eyes, listening to the lull of Izuku\u2019s voice and the rare interruption of someone asking a question. He forces himself to zone back in before he can fall asleep. When he looks around, he sees Todoroki staring at his phone, the screen angled just so that Hitoshi can glimpse the contents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s looking at <em>rings.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi thunks his head to the desk and has to cough into his elbow to muffle his laughter. <em> This boy is a whole trip, </em> he thinks as he tries to mask his chuckles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His amusement is cut short by a loud \u201chah?!\u201d causing him to look up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka is smirking at Izuku who snorts. Bakugou is glaring over from his desk, headphones off once more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to know if Deku-kun had anything about Bakugou!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat brought this up?\u201d Hitoshi asks no one in particular. Todoroki doesn\u2019t respond, still browsing through his phone. The other closest person, Shouji, just looks at him briefly before shrugging. Excellent. Fountains of information, all of you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe talked about all of us and what we\u2019re doing wrong. Why not be fair and also talk about Bakugou?\u201d The gravity girl ignores the pointed growl sent her way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw come on Blasty!\u201d Ashido, bless her, tries to joke. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat shitty nerd\u2019s not going to say one damn thing I don\u2019t already know about <em> my </em> quirk.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sure he has something to say about your hero personality!\u201d Uraraka exclaims. \u201cOr maybe some embarrassing stories? You\u2019ve known each other forever after all!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare!\u201d Bakugou warns. He\u2019s gripping the edges of his desk too tightly to be good for his hands. He is summarily ignored.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka, like the professional shit-stirrer she is, just faces Izuku and bats her eyelashes. \u201cWell?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere to start? I have a whole list of grievances about Kacchan! There\u2019s the time he broke my All Might figurine in preschool when we were playing, the time when he made me eat his mom\u2019s cooking because he felt bad wasting it but it tasted awful, the time he vomited on the couch but blamed me and I had to clean it. Oh! There\u2019s the time he burned my notebook--\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop, shitty nerd!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThose were pretty tame,\u201d Izuku says. He rests his cheek on his palm, leaning on his desk and watching Bakugou from the corner of his eye. \u201cI have so <em> much </em> more.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d Bakugou screams.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn, no, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut your damn mouth before I make you,\u201d Bakugou threatens at top volume and ignites a single palm. The class, who had been watching the exchange like a high-speed tennis match, tense in anticipation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s on his feet so fast he\u2019s a blur. His own palm slams against the desk. Everyone flinches at the sudden noise and movement. Hitoshi almost flinches from Izuku\u2019s feral grin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, Ka-cchan,\u201d he enunciates each syllable with purpose and a chill sweeps through the room. Bakugou flushes red and grinds his teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa drags himself out of his sleeping bag to glare at both boys as Bakugou lets out an unholy screech of frustration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I say about fighting? Do I need to repeat myself?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both sit back in their seats, one calmer than the other. Izuku watches Bakugou from the corner of his eye but doesn\u2019t make any further comment. He still smirks at the blond boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s face practically screams that he needs a vacation. Maybe Hitoshi should be nice and bring him a latte for their next training session. Or they could go to a cat cafe afterward? He's conflicted about the obvious annoyance on his mentor\u2019s face. There\u2019s really only so much an exhausted man can take, isn\u2019t there?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No more confrontations happen during their not-quite-English period. Ashido and Hagakure distract from the tension and cajole the class into making \u201cget well\u201d cards for Present Mic. Hitoshi draws a doodle of a bird, having heard Aizawa call his best friend a cockatoo many, <em>many</em> times. Yaoyorozu creates craft supplies and he notes that Izuku\u2019s card is incredibly well-sketched and also a horrifying contrast of neon colors. Present Mic will love it. Aizawa disappears from the room like a ghost before anyone can ask him to deliver the gifts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midnight strolls into class next, smiling and reminding the students about their presentations. Many groan, a couple cheer, and Izuku actually seems excited to speak in public. Hitoshi relaxes a little at seeing the goal of the brainwashing come to fruition. The art history teacher grins and connects the projector. Iida volunteers to go first, robotically going through armor motifs in different art pieces, Aoyama riveted and sparkling. A few others present their reports on different paintings or propaganda pieces. Izuku then offers to go next, leading Hitoshi to realize the fiftieth mistake he\u2019s made in this effort to be a good friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku without the fear of public speaking is <em>magnetic.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He practically prowls to the front of the class. He clicks through his presentation--yes, on an All Might series of artwork--with passion and not a stutter in sight. Midnight is against a wall, hands clasped in front of her and squealing in delight. She\u2019s almost sparkling as her most anxious student commands the room with nothing but his words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku musses his hair when clicking to the next slide, head tilted to highlight his jaw. Hitoshi isn\u2019t the only one who has to gulp or take a deep breath. Uraraka is bright pink, Jirou is pointedly staring at her desk, and Aoyama is biting his lip. Todoroki stares, open-mouthed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The confidence Izuku holds when he gestures with his hand and grins in delight at the entranced class is almost overwhelming. He can practically see Ojiro and Sero questioning everything they knew about themselves and their love lives. Hitoshi is too mentally exhausted for this collective level of gay panic but there\u2019s no escaping. Not when Izuku beams and asks, \u201cany questions?\u201d and absentmindedly licks his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat job, Midoriya!\u201d Midnight praises after several seconds of the class rebooting. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole new you. Channel this confidence for your PR lessons, cutie!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs sheepishly and nods. He sits down and the rest of the class continues with at least one person always staring at Izuku, who is enraptured in all of the following presentations. More than one classmate gets flustered beneath his intense stare. When everyone finishes, Midnight offers both compliments and criticisms just in time for the lunch bell to ring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Izuku groans, popping out of his seat and heading towards his friends. He enthusiastically leads them to the cafeteria.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone follows in morbid curiosity, half still under Izuku\u2019s spell. Kirishima has enough wherewithal to notice Bakugou stomping away as the rest of his friend group follows the entire class to a single, long table. Kirishima glances between the energetic teens before sighing and following his blond friend. Hitoshi wonders if Kirishima knows he\u2019s too good for this world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Dekusquad claims the closest seats to Izuku but the rest pile in wherever they can. Todoroki practically teleports to Izuku\u2019s right side. Tokoyami sits next to Hitoshi and picks at his apple slices, feathers somewhat ruffled. Hitoshi bro-nods at Dark Shadow who peeks out from behind the boy\u2019s back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI liked your presentation, Mido!\u201d Ashido compliments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very well done,\u201d Iida adds. His cheeks are still lightly dusted pink. They darken when Izuku smiles and thanks him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They chat about the presentations for several minutes while everyone grabs food and starts eating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of fashion choices,\u201d Ashido says when they talk about the wilder costumes during the start of the quirk era that Yaoyorozu presented on, \u201cMido, do you think you\u2019ll be keeping this look?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d Izuku responds, mouth full of rice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole open-collar sexy vibe you have.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSexy?\u201d He asks, eyebrows raised. Ashido nods enthusiastically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019m digging the style.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does look good,\u201d Ojiro mumbles at the end of the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku hums, poking his meal with his chopsticks. \u201cI might. I don\u2019t like how my ties usually turn out but I didn\u2019t want to cause any issues about the dress code.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iida glances away, still remembering the confrontation from the morning and embarrassed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely better than your attempts at tying,\u201d Kaminari teases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do your tie for you,\u201d Todoroki leans in. He\u2019s watching Izuku intently. \u201cAny day, just ask.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOooh very smooth,\u201d Dark Shadow notes. Hitoshi glances at the sentient quirk and then to Tokoyami, who is face-palming.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did Todoroki have game?\u201d Jirou asks Kaminari. The electric boy is grinning and whispers to her, both of them giggling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well, if it isn\u2019t the losers of class 1-A,\u201d an obnoxious voice interrupts before they could hear Izuku's response.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, not <em>him</em>,\u201d Hagakure groans. Monoma only sneers back. Uraraka scrutinizes the new arrival.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m kind of curious about what will happen...\u201d she trails off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Monoma-kun,\u201d Iida greets stiffly. The smirk on Monoma\u2019s face reminds Hitoshi just why he\u2019s glad he was put in 1-A. Not that the students of 1-B weren\u2019t alright, he was actually pretty cool with most of them. He, Kuroriri, and Sen have a groupchat for dark humor and memes. Everyone was competitive but ultimately laid back. Yes, 1-A also has an egotistical blond who needs to always prove he\u2019s the best but at least there\u2019s Izuku.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Speaking of, his green-haired friend is side-eyeing Monoma as he prattles on about their upcoming joint training and how \u201c1-B will obviously do better against Ketsubetsu than your dysfunctional class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku huffs and points at the blond with his chopsticks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMonoma-kun, you have such a versatile quirk and enough charisma to really be a top hero.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do, I--\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad your inferiority complex is shoved so far up your ass you\u2019ll never walk out of our class\u2019s shadow.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monoma pales. Uraraka presses her hands to her mouth to muffle her snickers while Iida gapes. Asui turns her face away, shoulders subtly shaking and leaning against Uraraka. Hitoshi can\u2019t help the low whistle he gives while Todoroki makes heart-eyes at their friend.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he mumbles. It\u2019s half-aware at best. Todoroki hasn\u2019t looked away and Hitoshi is hard-pressed to believe anything less than a nuclear explosion will distract him. Only a few people had heard Todoroki\u2019s quiet outburst, Izuku included.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The smile that spreads across Izuku\u2019s face is new. It's not the bright and happy grin that warms their hearts. It\u2019s not the determined--sometimes nervous--grin from training or facing down villains. It\u2019s not even the playful or teasing smirk he\u2019s been showing off throughout the day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It starts slow; syrupy and sweet. There\u2019s a hint of warmth high on Izuku\u2019s cheeks and a sparkle in his eye. There\u2019s no typical flustered blush; just an edge of pink against freckles. An inviting curl on his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s breath literally hitches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi\u2019s chest is uncomfortably tight. He resists the urge to rub his collarbone. Must be cholesterol or something. It\u2019s not like he wants Izuku to smile like that at <em>him. </em>That\u2019s weird for friends. He\u2019s not the world\u2019s foremost expert on friendship but he\u2019s pretty sure about that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d Monoma tries to interrupt before Izuku could respond. More than one person has to tear their eyes away from that <em>smile</em>. Izuku glances over at the other boy and clicks his tongue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot now Monoma-kun, the adults are talking.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kendou walks up once she spots the frozen Monoma standing in front of their table and gaping unattractively. The rest of the table is too busy laughing to hear her approach but they quiet when they see the kind girl. She grimaces in apology and grabs the back of the blond boy\u2019s collar, shaking him like an errant puppy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about him. Is he bothering you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Kendou-chan!\u201d The class president blinks at Izuku\u2019s warm greeting. \u201cNo need to apologize for him, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Besides, none of us here actually care about his opinion on our class.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <em>does </em>get repetitive,\u201d Jirou says from the end of the table, chin on hand. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped paying attention.\u201d Shouji nods next to her, the mouth formed on his arm grinning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a chihuahua barking at wolves,\u201d Hitoshi drawls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku turns and smiles at him, amused. <em> Victory. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...alright.\u201d Kendou looks between the frazzled Monoma and the entire table of giggling hero students. Hitoshi can understand her confusion--usually, the class reacts with exasperation or attempts at violence in certain explosive cases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She decides to just shake her head and drag her classmate off as usual. Monoma comes back to himself as they start to move, spluttering something incomprehensible but no one pays attention. Yaoyorozu smiles compassionately at Kendou and invites her to join them for lunch sometime. The redhead nods, once again surprised, and leaves them to eat in egotistical-blond-free peace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of lunch is spent with easy companionship and teasing. Every so often, at least one person is glancing at Izuku, whether in admiration or amusement as he continues talking animatedly with Tokoyami and Sero from down the table. Lunch is a little more raucous, a little more chaotic, but Hitoshi finds himself smiling into his drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds his earlier worries about Izuku\u2019s new attitude disappearing. Yes, Izuku is causing mayhem with words alone. Yes, he will probably regret some of the things he\u2019s said come tomorrow but that\u2019s just because he\u2019s generally a kind person who usually has a filter. But the more he watches Izuku interact with their classmates the more he realizes that yeah, this is <em>actually</em> Izuku. He\u2019s known Izuku as a sassy little shit when sleep-deprived. But he\u2019s still kind. Still passionate and smart and enthusiastic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>More willing to stand up for himself, which can only count as a good thing. Hitoshi is used to having to carefully skirt the line between intimidating bullies and not causing trouble; Izuku carries himself like he\u2019d barely tried the first option. Which surprises him since the boy is a bundle of gremlin energy wrapped in All Might merch.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So yeah. He knows how much anxiety can restrict you. To think Izuku carried <em>this </em>much? Hitoshi is feeling better about his actions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, life at UA is already so goddamn weird. Something like this might as well happen. It\u2019s important for hero students to expect the unexpected, or some other fortune cookie bullshit Aizawa likes to spring on him. Maybe it\u2019d be a reality check for <em>certain </em>people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the day is comparatively calm until their double period of Foundational Heroics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might comes into the classroom with his trademark grin followed by a wracking cough. Hitoshi is honestly concerned for the guy; he respects the hell out of the former number one hero but can admit he felt resentful at the \u201cperfect limelight hero\u201d image.\u00a0 Getting to actually know the sweet, kind-of-dumb man as Yagi-sensei has taken some work and more pity than one would expect. He knows All Might gave up his life, time, and health to protect others and this is what he\u2019s been left with. Hitoshi will admit on his more introspective nights that he\u2019s not sure he would\u2019ve lasted as long as the hero does with his injuries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, he\u2019s come to act the same towards All Might as Aizawa does: exasperation at the dramatics but secret concern and checking on his well-being. Izuku had told him before that most of the class carries a handkerchief for their teacher and that the faculty all mandate breaks for the hero to rest between classes. Hitoshi just packs a paw print-covered hankie and reserves most of his sarcasm for his other teachers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not to say that he doesn\u2019t roll his eyes just a bit when All Might still reads off their technical lesson plan on coordinating search and rescue from flash cards. He\u2019s only human after all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second half of their heroics class is a training exercise, so they pile out of the classroom to change into their costumes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The class loiters around the entrance to Ground Alpha, the closest fake city to the school. All Might has yet to arrive from the control room where he was setting up whatever activity he had for them. Iida was leading the teens in stretching, most following along with the loud instructions. More than a few people keep looking at Izuku, incredibly flexible for someone with his muscles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Momo, can you help me? I\u2019ve had this knot in my shoulder and none of these stretches are helping,\u201d Ashido asks with a frown when Iida is finished. Yaoyorozu was a surprising contender as a future chiropractor. She\u2019d walked on many a classmate\u2019s back to pop their spine and often recommended certain acupuncture procedures alongside specialty teas for Hitoshi\u2019s sleepless nights. Hitoshi had accepted the tea but not the needles. He trusts Yaoyorozu but he and sharp stabby things don\u2019t mix.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mineta\u2019s salivating immediately at the conversation. His demented chuckling gets everyone\u2019s attention. The girls\u2019 shoulders hunch. Ashido scowls and turns to her friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...maybe we can head back into the locker room.\u201d Yaoyorozu gestures for Ashido to escape the grape pervert but Mineta loudly whines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw come on, why can\u2019t you give us a show?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Mineta rubs his hands together and leers. Uraraka steps towards the two girls, Asui following and glaring at the creep. A shadow falls over the boy from behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I speak for everyone here when I say <em> stop being gross</em>, you raggedy bitch.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku looms over the tiny boy with his arms crossed and a serious expression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell! It\u2019s not gross to want to see two hot babes rub each other!\u201d Mineta protests. \u201cCome on, what are you? Some kind of homo?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jirou and Ashido both squawk in offense. Shouji, Asui, and Yaoyorozu wince. Hitoshi hears Uraraka\u2019s knuckles crack and a snap of forming ice from Todoroki. Iida is spluttering in outrage while the rest of the class wears dark, angry expressions. Even Bakugou is glaring at the pervert who has turned to face the class with an oblivious, \u201cwhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s face doesn\u2019t change. He simply stills, bowing his head so his fluffy bangs block his eyes. Hitoshi is seconds away from angrily crushing Mineta\u2019s self-esteem before green lightning arcs around Izuku.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He rears a single leg back before kicking Mineta in the reinforced metal diaper. The impact sends swirling gusts of wind across the ground. The entire class watches a screaming Mineta disappear into the sky. Uraraka whistles and slow claps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting better at distance,\u201d Izuku mumbles to himself, hand to his forehead to block out the sun as the purple dot fades past the boundaries of the training ground. He remains completely calm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we...check on him?\u201d Kirishima asks less than half-heartedly. Tokoyami shakes his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe shall be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWaste of time!\u201d Dark Shadow chimes in. If Hitoshi didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d say Kirishima\u2019s nod was relieved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several minutes later, All Might joins the suddenly carefree group of teenagers. Ashido is rotating her shoulder, pain-free, while the rest of the girls circle around Izuku, laughing and smiling. In fact, the crowd has circled around the bright boy even tighter than in the classroom. Everyone except Bakugou is talking and happy when their teacher clears his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will be working on your rescue techniques under attack! Your experience at the provisional license exam may have given you a glimpse of protecting civilians during battle but a hero must finetune their multi-tasking. You will be split into groups to rescue dummies in different parts of the city, but you will also be under attack from the other teams. The team with the most rescues will be the victor!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might grins at their responding enthusiasm. \u201cThis shall test your teamwork, strategy, and rescue training. I highly recommend you decide who will be rescuers and who will be battlers. I have divided up the five teams. With your numbers, one team will have five people instead of four.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that, sensei,\u201d Uraraka interrupts gleefully. The teacher pauses, somewhat flustered. He scans the group of teenagers. Izuku smirks, chin to his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re short someone, hm?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAhem,\u201d Iida answers, pushing his glasses up his face and pointedly not looking at his teacher like the bad liar he is. \u201cMineta has gone to Recovery Girl. He is not feeling well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! I see! Very good, young Iida, thank you. Alright, we will have five groups of four. As for your teams, here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever deities exist and are watching him must bless him, because he\u2019s on Izuku\u2019s team with Sato and Kouda. Todoroki and Bakugou are on separate teams. Kirishima has his own. Hitoshi isn\u2019t a betting man, and of course he wants to win the exercise, but with Yaoyorozu and Uraraka on the last team, he can\u2019t help but want to put his money on them. Izuku bounds over to Hitoshi and Sato while Kouda walks up, but All Might calls Izuku over to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung Midoriya, could I speak with you for a second?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku waves the others to go first. Hitoshi hesitates when he sees All Might looking concerned. He decides to stay close in case his friend is in trouble so steps away to hover near the entrance to the city. He\u2019s technically out of sight but able to hear when All Might asks Izuku about some things he\u2019s heard from the other teachers and how the teen\u2019s been affected by a quirk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, All Might. I promise,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, my boy. I was concerned to hear you were acting differently.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that different, I don\u2019t think. I can\u2019t really tell.\u201d Izuku laughs a little sheepishly. Hitoshi can almost imagine him rubbing the back of his neck. It seemed that even with his confidence boost and missing anxiety, he still has some of his nervous habits. Hitoshi is about to turn away when he feels another presence close to him. Looking over his shoulder, he sees Todoroki also hiding behind the wall and staring at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He mouths silently. Todoroki just shrugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you be up to this exercise, young Midoriya?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course! I have to make you proud after all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might coughs. \u201cMy boy, you always make me proud.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both Hitoshi and Todoroki glance at each other. Maybe he should step away from what is obviously becoming more sentimental than expected. He\u2019s about to nod his head to get Todoroki to leave with him when Izuku hums happily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, dad.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi wheezes while Todoroki blue-screens. All Might splutters, \u201cd-dad?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I mean, you\u2019re not the best teacher if I\u2019m completely honest and I feel like you could use some help with actually working with kids but you\u2019re still my favorite mentor and father figure. I\u2019ve seen you that way for a while.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi whips his head around to peer past the concrete wall and sees Izuku grab All Might for a hug, pressing his face into the man\u2019s bony chest. All Might is obviously overwhelmed, tears gathering in the corner of his eyes and belatedly hugging back. He murmurs something to Izuku too low for Hitoshi to hear but he notices how Izuku squeezes tighter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Todoroki hisses behind him. Hitoshi turns back to shush him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d He repeats louder. Why the hell is there a manic look in his eyes?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you hear something?\u201d All Might asks Izuku who tilts his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Izuku disengages from his mentor and turns in their direction, Hitoshi scowls and slaps a hand over Todoroki\u2019s mouth, dragging him away from their hiding spot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pulling Todoroki all the way to the designated start was a credit to Aizawa\u2019s upper strength training regimen. Hitoshi spares a mental second to mock his previous noodle-arm self. Then another to mock Todoroki for his zoned-out look even after Hitoshi releases him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d He can\u2019t help but ask. First rule of eavesdropping is to not yell and give away your position.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was right,\u201d Todoroki says, \u201cMidoriya is All Might\u2019s secret love child.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi just.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He just <em>can\u2019t </em>right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How he hadn\u2019t heard that particular theory from his deskmate was a mystery in itself. For someone who was obviously into all things Izuku, one would think he\u2019d share the wildest theory he had about the boy. Hitoshi stares at Todoroki who looks completely pleased with himself. How many people had he told this to? Did Izuku know?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Hitoshi hates to admit it, will never say it out loud, but he...can actually see it. The smile, the names of his ultimate moves, how close the two seem especially after that interaction--stop, no, he\u2019s not going down this rabbit hole.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he drawls, shaking his head. Life motto, must remember his life motto. \u201cGood job. It\u2019s time to do the exercise though. Go find your team.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi pushes Todoroki to walk away towards his own team\u2019s starting point in the city. Hitoshi pinches the bridge of his nose for a solid thirty seconds before Izuku appears and walks towards him. He lights up when he sees Hitoshi and beckons him to follow to their team. Sato and Kouda patiently wait for the duo to arrive and immediately all three turn to Izuku who\u2019s already grinning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a plan. Kouda-kun and Sato-kun will be one team, mainly focuses on rescue since Kouda-kun can locate the civilians and Sato-kun can handle any debris. Both of you are strong so I trust you\u2019ll be able to handle a fight, but you\u2019ll be focused mostly on defense. Shinsou-kun and I will also scout to fight against the other teams. Most will be focused on rescue operations or expect the entire team to move together but this way we can divide and conquer. Between us, we have a great balance to handle any issues.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kouda blushes at the compliment while Sato grins brightly. They agree with the plan easily enough and Kouda conscripts a few birds to investigate the city. They decide to work through an entire section, spreading out as they need. When the signal bell starts, they split their pairs to head into two directions. Sato and Kouda check in on their comms each time they find a dummy civilian. Izuku and Hitoshi both save a dummy each but they cause much more chaos beyond the exercise\u2019s goal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi yanks Hagakure in his capture weapon, Izuku wrapping the issued capture tape around her wrists. They tag-team against Kaminari by psyching out the blond with Izuku\u2019s stealthy quick attacks and Hitoshi jumping in with his voice modifier. Ojiro is sent flying by his tail with one of Izuku\u2019s air blasts, Kirishima trying to catch him only to end up also blasted away. More than one building may be destroyed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi can\u2019t stop grinning. The glee on Izuku\u2019s face fits well alongside his usual determination. It feels nice to work together. To win. They make it through half the city just by attacking the other teams but as they run into a deserted area, they\u2019re ambushed. Hitoshi and Izuku bolt out of the way of an exploding wall. In the smoke, Bakugou stands with a scowl and flickering palms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down, shitty Deku. You\u2019ve been acting up all day.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hi Kacchan! Here to kill us?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi chokes on his laughter. Izuku is blas\u00e9 about repeating one of Bakugou\u2019s standard catchphrases, even raising an eyebrow expectantly. Bakugou aims a large explosion at them. Both boys separate, Hitoshi backing farther away from the consequential fire. He glances around for Bakugou\u2019s teammate but the blond is alone. How typical.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku bites his lip, finger to his chin. He looks Bakugou up and down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting better but you\u2019re nowhere near where you need to be in order to be the number one hero. Or a decent person. I strongly recommend anger management sessions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou runs forward to kick at the space Izuku used to be. His explosion spins him into a Howitzer Impact, following after Izuku who bounces on a building\u2019s wall. Izuku takes a chunk of concrete from the ground and hurls it like a discus at his classmate, who explodes it to pieces and screams.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so tough?! You get hit with a quirk and now you think you\u2019re better than me? Huh?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi sighs. \u201cAre you done?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou wisely doesn\u2019t answer, just glares. He\u2019s about to try using his quirk again, mimicking Izuku\u2019s voice, when the boy himself snorts. \u201cYes, actually.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>do</em> think I\u2019m stronger than you,\u201d Izuku says and flicks a superpowered finger at Bakugou, powerful wind making him skid backward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou!\u201d Bakugou doesn\u2019t even finish his sentence before ricocheting forward with two large explosions. Hitoshi leaps backward, capture weapon at the ready, but Izuku simply lunges to meet the blond in the middle, immediately in Bakugou\u2019s personal space and kicking upwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou-kun, go scout the area and back-up Kouda,\u201d Izuku commands. Bakugou barely manages to avoid his punch. \u201cI can handle this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He radios in for his team, only for Sato to confirm they\u2019ve gotten most of the dummies in their sector. Hitoshi decides to drag himself up to one of the nearby roofs to get out of the blast radius but he can\u2019t help himself from watching under the pretense of \u201cproviding backup.\u201d He notices Sero and Todoroki in a building several meters away, shoring up walls with ice and tape while Jirou carries out a dummy. All three of them glance over at the smoke wafting from his direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not stronger than me, Deku. You\u2019re just a useless weakling!\u201d Bakugou pants, bruised and bleeding. Izuku leisurely stands across from him, hand on hip, which only enrages the other boy more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan, do you remember how upset you were during the sports festival because Todoroki-kun wouldn\u2019t use his fire against you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Bakugou snarls, pushing himself forward. Izuku dances around each attempt to grab him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember the temper tantrum you threw at Ground Beta instead of getting therapy?\u201d Another wind blast from his fingers and Bakugou crashes into a street lamp. \u201cOh, sorry, I mean, remember our previous \u2018fight\u2019?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi raises an eyebrow as he stays low. He sees Todoroki\u2019s team walking closer and informs his own teammates over the comms. Sato confirms while Izuku just sighs and clicks his tongue at his old childhood friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was only using eight percent of my power.\u201d Bakugou freezes. Izuku rests both of his arms behind his head, staring thoughtfully. \u201cHere, I\u2019m using about six.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou damn bastard!\u201d Bakugou screams. His face turns bright red beneath the dust coating it. He flexes his fingers before flying into the air and barreling down like a demented missile. His exploding punch misses Izuku as the boy darts upwards, right behind Bakugou, and suplexes him to the ground. Izuku glares as Bakugou continues to yell curses and grabs the taller teen's collar to drag him upright.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You know Kacchan, it would be an absolute shame if All Might ever found out exactly the kinds of things you said to his favorite student and successor. The exact words that came out of your mouth every day. Tell me, do you think he'd be pleased with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku brings Bakugou\u2019s face even closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think he'd call that 'Plus Ultra Behavior'?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou swings another exploding fist. Izuku maneuvers his feet to spin both of them and then yeets Bakugou across the training field. The boy tries to course-correct with a blast but tumbles through the dirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku stalks forward. Hitoshi can\u2019t stop gaping as the other boy dodges Bakugou\u2019s next attack with ease and kicks out at his midsection. Bakugou retches before Izuku slams him to the ground back-first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll you do is scream. Do you not get tired? Do you not just want to have a peaceful day and not go apeshit over the smallest things? I\u2019d like some peace and it\u2019s only because we used to be friends and because I <em>do</em> care about you that I haven\u2019t forcibly gotten it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, Deku-!\u201d Bakugou rasps. He\u2019s scrambling his hands into the dirt to gain leverage but Izuku\u2019s knee on his chest prevents him from moving. He lets off an explosion but Izuku simply diverts his wrist and harshly pins it into the dirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"So, Kacchan, I\u2019ll say this once. <em>Do better.</em> And you know what? There are more ways to get what you want than through violence, I don\u2019t want to kill you or anything if I use more than eight percent. So how about this: if you don't start acting right, I'm telling Uncle Marasu about what you told me to do in middle school.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou completely stills under Izuku\u2019s poisonous green eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d He asks, smiling politely and gripping Bakugou\u2019s wrist tighter until the blond boy looks away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi takes everything back. <em> That </em>was the sexiest thing he\u2019s ever seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Judging by the rising steam coming off of Todoroki who arrives just in time to see the end of the fight, he agrees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou opens and closes his mouth for several seconds. Hitoshi isn\u2019t close enough to see his facial expression but the boy\u2019s shoulders are tenser than steel. Izuku huffs and lets go of the blond, almost carefree in his posture. He lifts a hand to his earpiece but All Might\u2019s voice rings out across the entire city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of the citizens have been rescued! Students, please return to the entrance.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku grins and ignores Bakugou as he walks toward the assembled Sero, Todoroki, and Jirou. Hitoshi scales down from the building and joins the group. Sero and Jirou glance back at Bakugou who is carefully pulling himself from the crater on the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d Sero asks his friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, Soy Sauce,\u201d Bakugou says woodenly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The students gather at the entrance, some with scrapes and some still pulling the capture tape off of them. Bakugou is one of the last to arrive, limping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku showers Kouda and Sato in compliments when he sees them, ecstatic about their good work. Their team nets second place but had outstanding teamwork, according to their teacher. Hitoshi was right to mentally bet on Yaoyorozu\u2019s team. She, Uraraka, Shouji, and Aoyama decimated the competition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They move towards the locker rooms after All Might offers them constructive criticism. The teacher sends Bakugou to Recovery Girl for his injuries. His friends are shocked when the blond only looks down and trudges off silently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku drags Hitoshi forward with their team, also complimenting him on his ambush techniques and the rappelling he did out of the building with the civilian dummy. Todoroki follows behind them and catches the blush on Hitoshi\u2019s face at Izuku\u2019s enthusiastic praise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi stops when he feels a cold hand on his wrist. He startles and turns to see Todoroki who quickly retracts his hand.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou,\u201d Todoroki says. The rest of the class continues forward, disappearing into the locker room. The two boys stare at each other awkwardly in the now empty hallway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d When it becomes clear Todoroki is just going to stand there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy squints and looks at Hitoshi from head to toe. <em>Take a picture, it\u2019ll last longer,</em> he grumbles to himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...are we love rivals?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>What.</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d He says, not at all high-pitched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like Midoriya. So we must be love rivals.\u201d Curse Todoroki for being this straight-froward. It was often hilarious and even more refreshing. On rare occasions, it could even be called cute. But this kind of blunt statement wasn\u2019t reassuring when he was on the receiving end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a brief moment, Hitoshi wants to go with his gut and just deny. There\u2019s no way he likes his friend, right? A cute boy who might have a little sex appeal and laughs at his dark humor in the middle of the night. One of his first true friends who decided to stick by him and actually help instead of just wishing him well. Someone he feels he could confide in about anything. Someone he\u2019d break the carefully constructed lines around his quirk for in order for them to have one day away from their bad thoughts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi knew himself and knew he wasn\u2019t emotionally mature enough for a relationship. He had fucking trauma, okay. No doubt Izuku did too, and doubly so for whatever was going on with Todoroki. So it would be easier to just deny Todoroki\u2019s accusations. Yet the thought of saying \"no, I don't like Izuku\" made his chest tight. Seeing Izuku cozied up to someone, loving someone, while he could only watch? What the hell was he supposed to feel about that? He won't deny he's fonder of Izuku than he is of other people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But to be someone\u2019s rival? Someone who would no doubt encase him in an iceberg if he tried to make a move? The insomniac already wants to sigh in defeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds like too much work,\u201d he mutters. His fingers brush through his gravity-defying hair, resisting the urge to tug on it self-consciously. Todoroki frowns, speculative.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Are we not love rivals?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s whatever,\u201d he tries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you do like Midoriya?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi groans. \u201cI mean, obviously. I have eyes.\u201d Then again, after today, at least half of the class was also now in the Izuku Appreciation Club. He tactfully doesn\u2019t say that. Todoroki frowns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, don\u2019t worry about it, okay?\u201d With that, he awkwardly shrugs and goes for the locker room, self-conscious and eager to get his gear off to end the day. Todoroki follows and Hitoshi can feel the boy\u2019s eyes on his back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching carefully,\u201d Todoroki says quietly as they\u2019re the last to leave the locker room. Izuku is walking ahead, surrounded by Asui and Tokoyami, engaging them in a heated discussion. Ashido keeps pestering him for a piggyback ride, grinning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re going to be there anytime he and I are alone together?\u201d Hitoshi can\u2019t believe this. Did he just gain a stalker? When he wasn't even planning on making a move or confessing?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I have to.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi blinks into space. This class was so weird. Hell, his friends--and yes, <em>Izuku wins</em>, he\u2019ll admit they\u2019re his friends--are also so weird.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...just do what you want.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. This is a very non-confrontational rivalry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry up you two! We\u2019re heading to the dorms for a movie marathon!\u201d Uraraka calls before Hitoshi can facepalm. The two boys look at each other, one more resigned than the other, and hurry their pace to join the group.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ordering pizza,\u201d Yaoyorozu raises a hand, smiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can have a party!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a school night!\u201d Iida reminds them, conversations devolving into arguments over whether it would be okay to stay up late.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have some things I\u2019d like to discuss with you too, Midoriya,\u201d Todoroki says. More than one person jeers and teases the boy. \u201cI\u2019d like your input on a project.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure! You coming, Shinsou-kun?\u201d Izuku asks. The afternoon sun shines off of his hair. Another heart-stopping smile. Hitoshi squints and nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A text alert jolts him from the entrancing sight. He pulls out his phone to see a message from Aizawa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Dadzawa:</b> I have two incident reports from Recovery Girl and about 40 texts from Midnight and All Might alone. I didn\u2019t want to know but now I\u2019m making this your problem. Spill everything or I swear to god.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi grimaces at the message before looking up. He follows after Todoroki and Izuku, the latter gesturing wildly and beaming. He starts typing as he follows them to the dorms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku wakes up slowly, reaching up to grab a piece of paper stuck to his cheek. He opens his eyes and immediately regrets everything and aborts mission. His head feels like it was Detroit Smashed and the weak early morning sunlight pouring in through his curtains must have a personal vendetta against him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and tries to open his eyes again with more success. He\u2019s in his bed surrounded by dozens of loose papers and a few pens. He shifts and oh, okay. That\u2019s a person. He squints over his shoulder to see Shouto asleep with his mouth open and drooling. Trying to turn back around, he notices Hitoshi also on the bed but sitting against the wall, one hand resting on Izuku\u2019s ankle while the taller boy snores.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He squints at the paper that was stuck to his face. It\u2019s covered with three sets of handwriting, outlining an attack plan. Oh, it\u2019s outlining alibis and an ambush plan for Endeavor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hm. Okay. Unexpected but something he can work with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the hazy confusion from sleep clears and reality crashes into him like a semi-truck. And so do his memories of the previous day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh god, the things he said. The things he <em>did.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He picked a fight with so many people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(He\u2019s always thought about snapping back at Kacchan, since well before middle school. He\u2019s always wanted to smack Mineta in the face when he got too gross to handle. He\u2019s always wanted to make someone sit down, shut up, and listen to him for goddamn once. But he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d <em>do </em>it. Especially like <em>that.</em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grabs his pillow to muffle his groan. Or suffocate himself. Whichever happens. Secondhand embarrassment has always been a problem for him. Firsthand, up close embarrassment? Just take him out back and put him out of his misery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tries to ignore the panic building in his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> He'd sassed his teachers</em>. He\u2019ll have to leave school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damn. Izuku really likes school though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His not-that-internal freakout must wake Hitoshi and Shouto. Probably the panicked wiggling. Shouto hums sleepily in a not-at-all cute way while Hitoshi cracks his neck and stretches. Not as cute, but <em>hello </em>collarbones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh look, now he\u2019s perving after his closest friends. Fantastic. He\u2019s noticed they\u2019re attractive, all of his friends are (curse his bisexual little heart) but now was <em>not </em>the time. Now was escape-plan time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku?\u201d Shouto asks quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s Izuku? There\u2019s no Izuku here,\u201d he squeaks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi chuckles then yawns obnoxiously. \u201cWhat, are you changing your name and going into hiding?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku drags the pillow from his face to pout at the lavender-haired teen. His plan was that see-through, huh?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop freaking out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d he wheezes. Shouto frowns and rests a cool hand on Izuku\u2019s forehead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, okay, deep breaths,\u201d Hitoshi says. He squeezes Izuku\u2019s ankle without realizing it. The grounding sensation helps him focus enough to even his breathing. He stares at the ceiling for a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to brainwash you again?\u201d Hitoshi jokingly offers. Both Izuku and Shouto freeze and turn to him in unison. \u201cWait, no, I\u2019m not actually going to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...it would be easier,\u201d Izuku admits. He liked feeling confident. He liked silencing all the negative thoughts in his head. He liked being Izuku, not worthless deku.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouto frowns while looking at his own hands. \u201cIf what happened yesterday was truly him, wouldn\u2019t it be fine to brainwash him again?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi groans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a short-term solution. Based on his reaction yesterday, the quirk is literally altering his brain chemicals, and the only suggestions or commands I\u2019ve done on people alter their conscious minds, not their literal neurons. That\u2019s not healthy for me to do. I\u2019m not a doctor and I\u2019m not as reliable as medication. If he isn\u2019t consistently brainwashed then he\u2019d have a huge fallout with the consequences of the suppression wearing of suddenly. I\u2019m not risking it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know a lot about this kind of stuff,\u201d Shouto says curiously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving a quirk like mine means I got really into learning about brains and stuff.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. I live for your approval,\u201d Hitoshi drawls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku sits up and fidgets with a loose thread on his pillowcase.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it really so bad?\u201d He mumbles. \u201cI trust you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi curses under his breath. He looks away, hiding his suddenly pink cheeks, not that Izuku can\u2019t see them. Shouto grumbles unintelligently. Is he glaring at Hitoshi? That\u2019s weird, Izuku could\u2019ve sworn they were becoming friends. Especially with how close they seemed yesterday.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(He is pointedly blocking the memory of the breathy \"marry me\" from yesterday's lunch. The grin on Hitoshi's face as they ran through the training city. The soft laughter between all three of them as they ran through hypothetical \"murder Endeavor\" scenarios. Friends. Friends, friends, <em>friends.</em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mental health is more important,\u201d Hitoshi states with a note of finality. Izuku huffs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFiiiiiiiine. I\u2019m still going to run off to live in the mountains. You both are welcome to visit me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be coming with you,\u201d Shouto says, matter-of-fact. Izuku does <em>not </em>squeak and blush.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in trouble or anything, Midoriya.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy for you to say! I <em>punted</em> Mineta!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it was great,\u201d Hitoshi insists. Shouto nods enthusiastically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yeah, okay, it was kind of great. But he still assaulted another student.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d have to deal with Kacchan too. And that, just. He wasn\u2019t sure he had enough mental energy to handle that fallout.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan is going to murder me today.\u201d Izuku moans and falls back to his pillow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can try, but I doubt he\u2019d succeed,\u201d Shouto tries to reassure him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cConsidering you wrecked his entire shit, he should stay out of your way for at least a few days.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to hate me,\u201d he mumbles. Did Kacchan deserve a smackdown? Yes. Did he want to ruin any chance of working together in the future? No. He\u2019s tried so hard already, even when Kacchan wouldn\u2019t do anything in return.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well. We\u2019ll deal with it. Okay? You don\u2019t have to do anything alone.\u201d Hitoshi rubs the back of his neck.\u00a0 Shouto nods, smiling softly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku can\u2019t stop the emotional tears that gather in his eyes. He pushes them down, not eager to start his day off crying. These two are really the best.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that sounds good. Hey, don\u2019t you both have to get ready for class?\u201d He redirects and gives them a wobbly smile. They both glance at each other and reluctantly nod. Hitoshi pats his shoulder and Shouto grabs his hand to give a quick squeeze. Blushing, Izuku waves them from his door as they both head to the elevator.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re out of sight, Izuku breathes out and rubs his hand. His shoulder feels tingly. He shakes himself and sits back on his bed. His phone is lit up with notifications so he takes a moment to check his messages.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Ochako:</strong> good morning deku! how\u2019re you feeling???\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Tenya:</strong> Midoriya-kun, I would like to invite you to join me on a morning run today. I feel as though I should apologize for not seeing how much your struggles have been affecting your mental state and I wish to check in with you. Please know you can always rely on me if you need anything. As a hero student and more importantly your friend... [1 / 5 messages]</p>\n<p><strong>Meimei:</strong> Hey ten million!!! Your friends said you recommended them to me for their gear. Nothing but the best from Hatsume Company :devil emoji: thanks! Make sure to come by the lab for your new babies too~! Should be done by this afternoon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles at his friends. He stretches and gathers clothes for the day. He might be able to meet with Tenya if he hurries, but then he continues to read his remaining messages as he walks around the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Eraserhead (!!!):</strong> Problem child, come to Nedzu\u2019s office before school starts. You\u2019re not in trouble but we have some things to discuss about yesterday.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>[Unknown Number]</strong>: Hello Midoriya-kun! When you come to my office, please be sure to bring your delightful notebooks! I would be greatly interested in discussing your analysis in more depth.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Eraserhead (!!!):</strong> Also don\u2019t listen to a word the rat says. If you respect me as a teacher at all, you won\u2019t turn to the dark side.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Yagi (Dad):</strong> My boy, make sure you are well-rested! If you need anything let me know. I wish to have lunch with you today if you are available :^)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Eraserhead (!!!)</strong>: And make sure you stop by Recovery Girl during the day.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Eraserhead (!!!)</strong>: We\u2019re getting you anti-anxiety medication.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku short-circuits at the last text. He doesn\u2019t have the emotional capacity to freak out about meeting Principal Nedzu just yet (the principal wanted his notebooks? Did he like something about Izuku\u2019s hobby? How\u2019d he find out? Okay, maybe he <em>was</em> starting to freak out).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa-sensei seemed so exasperated yesterday. He took one look at Izuku\u2019s personality and noped so hard he was almost catatonic. He had no doubt based on the texts that his teacher understood what exactly had happened to him. Did Hitoshi tell his mentor about his anxiety?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And here he was, offering Izuku help even if it would negatively affect his sanity. Izuku sniffs and clutches the phone. He's blessed to have great teachers for once in his life. He sends a text to Tenya confirming that he can do a short run but that he\u2019s needed in school early. He confirms with all of his friends and mentors that he\u2019s alive and well as he stumbles around the room to get ready. He\u2019s looking forward to going to class, maybe more anxious than usual, maybe not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe Mineta would act worse. Maybe Kacchan would act better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like Shouto and Hitoshi promised, they\u2019d figure it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls on his sneakers and runs out the door, humming the song Ashido played last night in the dorms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, bitch, yeah, I\u2019m a savage.\u201d </em>\n</p>"
