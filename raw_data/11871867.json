  "notes": "<p>PSA: If you want to headcanon a different Spider-Man than Tom Holland, more power to you. Weirdly I have no trouble reading fics where the author as used a different actor as the template, but people think they can come on here and shame me for using Holland. Regardless of the respective ages of the actors, they are all playing the same CHARACTER, who all happen to be underage in their first films. The excuses people use about the actors being older than Tom is really grasping at straws, and I don't have time for the anti bs. In this fic, Peter is an adult. If you don't like it, don't read it.</p>\n<p>Second PSA I never thought I'd have to add to a fic lmfao, but there is strong language in here, including the use of the name Jesus Christ. If that offends you, I suggest not reading any further.</p>\n<p>So there was this prompt on tumblr I stumbled across that asked: For some reason, Peter thinks Deadpool knows his secret identity so he thinks its not a big deal to chat with the merc in his civilian identity whenever he bumps into him in various locations. Wade, meanwhile, is confused on why a cute but grouchy nerd keeps talking to him like they know each other but hey, its New York! Eccentrics are everywhere and this guy is really cute and doesn\u2019t seem to mind hanging out with him! Also somehow they ended up maybe-or-maybe-not on a date???</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Tense change to indicate flashback to the Kree fight Peter mentioned in the first chapter-- I think it might be a bit confusing, but we *are* inside Wade's head, sooo...</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Just a warning that updates won't always be so close together. I am working on another WIP in another fandom and taking turns between chapters, but this is coming pretty quickly, too.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Sorry for the longer wait on this one. I can't tell you how amazing all your comments have been, but it makes me want to work extra hard to give you a great chapter and not just rush it to get it out faster. Thanks so much for your support &lt;3</p>\n<p>Also, my main fandom is Hannibal and I don't really have any friends/followers to talk Spideypool to. I'd love someone to look over chapters before I post, just to keep an eye on consistency and characterisation, if anyone is interested. Hit me up on tumblr: moku-youbi.tumblr.com</p>\n<p>warning for all kinds of nerd speak on the topic of treks, star wars, BSG, and more...</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I've got a couple more chapters already finished and the rest of the story outlined, but I am really angsting over a few pacing issues, so once again I'll put a call out for someone to talk things through with me regarding that and characterisation. It would help me to post more frequently, to be sure. Hit me up on tumblr (moku-youbi) if you're interested!</p>\n<p>Art in this chapter by the amazing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cervinelich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cervinelich</a> on twitter! Go shower them with love!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I want to thank everyone for the offers of help. I'm contacting everyone who offered, trying to find a good fit, but I do feel a bit more confident about what I've written and where this is all going, so the next chapter shouldn't be too long of a wait!</p>\n<p>Also, wow, this is such an incredible fandom--everyone here is so supportive and kind, and very generous with the feedback, which is just amazing, as an author. Thank you all so much for the kudos and the comments that keep me excited about writing &lt;3 You rock!</p>\n<p>Just warning that as far as angst goes, this is probably going to be the worst chapter. This is overall, supposed to be a light-hearted fic, but with Deadpool, there's some unavoidable darkness. Still, it won't last long, but be warned that there's some bad thoughts at the end of this chapter.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>SORRY! But it'll get better soon, I promise. However this time of year is super busy with autumn festivals and Halloween prep (we do a big party every year, so yeah, we're already getting things set up) anyway, it might be slightly longer between chapters, but I do plan on having this finished in the next few weeks!</p>\n<p>OMG, go check out the beautiful art <a href=\"https://cervinelich.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">cervinelich</a> made <a href=\"https://cervinelich.tumblr.com/post/181223941364/art-cervinelich-inktober-5-was-inspired-by\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a> and shower them with praise! I like to imagine it's their first kiss from chapter 5 :D<br>(ETA links have been updated since tumblr's purge, so they should work now!)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Haha, hate to cut you off right there, but this chapter was getting super long, so it was time to cut it off somewhere, and this was the best place. More soon, and I think we all know what's coming now :D</p>\n<p>Ahahahah, I love all of you and all your comments. I'm SO SORRY for leaving you hanging, but at least it wasn't for long, right? What can I say, your comments drove me to finish this as fast as I could so you can all enjoy it, as I've enjoyed your feedback and support. I've not really had a chance to edit it, so please forgive any errors, and I hope you have as much fun reading it as I had, writing :D</p>\n<p>Safe to say, this chapter finally earns the rating of the fic, be forewarned!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>It might take me a while to respond to all your comments--there were quite a lot on the last chapter--but please know that the mean so much to me. Every single one is treasured, and helps me to keep writing for you all! Thank you, and I love you guys \u2665</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I was super tempted to throw some Thorki in there, so just go ahead and have that confirmed as canon for this fic, if you ship it!</p>\n<p>Okay, this was supposed to be a short, porny little chapter, maybe 2k...and then it turned into this monster of yes, a lot of porn, but a lot of feelings too, and just these two being adorable and hot and in love. So, sorry for the massive chapter. I considered splitting it up, but since this is already marked as complete, I want anything I *do* add to still end on a satisfying place so there are no cliff-hangers and it feels neatly tied up. </p>\n<p>Also, I still plan to add a holiday themed epilogue very soon, but we'll see what time allows, this close to the holidays!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Okay, I know that's a bit of an abrupt ending, but I've been unexpectedly busy the weekend leading up to Christmas, and I really just wanted to get this up in time. Sorry if it feels rushed. </p>\n<p>HOWEVER, part of the problem was that I originally started it with Wade's first meetings with Peter's friends, and got a couple thousand words of Gwen's meeting and MJ and Ned's meeting before I realised there was no way I'd get them complete in time. I'm still going to finish them up and post them, because they're fun and I'm enjoying writing them, but they'll be out of chronological order, since they come before Wade meets May.</p>\n<p>So, the question is, do I just post them as additional chapters, or do I turn this into a series and post them as one-offs in the same universe? Any thoughts are appreciated!</p>\n<p>And Happy Holidays!</p>\n<p>ETA I've decided I'm not going to add any more chapters here. Any further content in this verse will be a separate one-off posted as part of a series with this one. So keep your eye out, because I'm working on the Wade meets Peter's friends installment, and then I will probably do a Peter meets the rest of Wade's friends installment as well.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cWade!\u201d</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s not unheard of for someone to know his name, but more often than not they tend to call him Deadpool when he\u2019s wearing the suit. He likes to think it\u2019s a sign of respect.</p>\n<p>[Or pant-shitting terror]</p>\n<p>Wade looks up from the screen of his phone where he\u2019s been destroying the shit out of the Imperius, and turns to find the source of his name. \u201cHey,\u201d the guy says, giving a friendly wave, and puts on a little speed to catch up with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Wade says back cautiously. </p>\n<p>The guy is really rocking the hot nerd look. Blue hoodie over a fitted t-shirt with a cartoonish representation of the periodic table proclaiming something about the element of surprise. Wavy brown hair that looks incredibly soft to the touch and flops across his forehead with a little curl. He\u2019s got a perfectly even and white smile, and the kind of eyes a guy could get lost in, behind round-rimmed glasses. </p>\n<p>He neatly cuts his way through the crowd on the path with his skateboard and skids to a stop when he reaches Wade. Taps his toe against the tail and neatly snaps the board up to his waiting hand, not missing a beat falling in stride with Wade\u2019s gait. </p>\n<p>Wade lets out a little whistle. \u201cSweet moves.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Check out those sweet little cheeks!]]</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Wade agrees distractedly. There\u2019s a pretty pink flush in the apple of the kid\u2019s cheeks, whether from the exertion or unseasonable heat. And he\u2019s taken by the impulse to lick them.</p>\n<p>[Don\u2019t do it.]</p>\n<p>\u201cBet they taste like strawberry, mmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[I meant his <i>other</i> cheeks.]]</p>\n<p>And oh, yes, Wade can now confirm it. \u201cOh sweet Sandra Dee, thanks for the skinny jeans,\u201d he mutters. Skateboarding does a body good, apparently. On top of that sinfully adorable face, he\u2019s got an ass to move Sir Mix-a-Lot to compose odes.</p>\n<p>[Yeah so why is he talking to us?]</p>\n<p>[[Maybe he\u2019s got us confused with someone else?]]</p>\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone thought he was Spidey, but still, \u201cHe called us Wade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d the kid\u2019s cheeks darken at that. \u201cSorry, I wasn\u2019t thinking. Do you prefer Deadpool in public?\u201d He looks so honestly contrite, chewing his pillowy bottom lip between his teeth in a way that should be fucking illegal, eyes cast at the ground.</p>\n<p>So, points for not being deterred by Wade talking to himself. \u201cNah, kid, you can call me whatever the fuck you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>His shoulders sag in relief. \u201cSorry, I just--secret identities and all that. I didn\u2019t want to out you or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Oh shit! He\u2019s adorable\u2026]]</p>\n<p>Wade laughs out loud. \u201cI think that boat sailed a long goddamn time ago.\u201d It isn\u2019t like he\u2019s ever tried very hard to hide. It wouldn\u2019t take an intrepid reporter to follow the threads from his business page on Facebook and put two and two together..</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing down here on campus anyway?\u201d the guy asks.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a weird familiarity about his tone and posture, and it\u2019s true that Wade is pretty far from home today but he\u2019s also sure he\u2019d remember that baby-face if he\u2019d seen it before. On the other hand, he has spent the better part of the past few years feeling like he\u2019s missed a step, so this conversation isn\u2019t exactly anything new.</p>\n<p>[[A hot guy is willingly talking to us. Go with it.]]</p>\n<p>[Don\u2019t make an ass of yourself.]</p>\n<p>\u201cShaddup,\u201d Wade grumbles, though Yellow has a point. He pats his belly. \u201cHad a craving. There\u2019s, ah, this little hole in the wall place down Bleeker that has chilaquiles to <i>die</i> for.\u201d</p>\n<p>The kid lets out this sound, and it\u2019s not Wade\u2019s fault there\u2019s an answering stir in his groin. A saint wouldn\u2019t be able but help to imagine that groan in a different context. Is this kid for fucking real?</p>\n<p>\u201cMedina\u2019s?\u201d he says. \u201cDamn it, your craving is contagious. If I didn\u2019t have an exam at two I\u2019d totally join you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade laughs nervously, rubs at the back of his neck where the velcro of the mask digs into his skin. Civilians don\u2019t usually come up and talk to him, let alone invite themselves along to lunch. They generally avert their eyes and give him a wide berth.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d he says, which is fucking stupid. The next time he stumbles upon the one implausibly hot New Yorker who actually instigates conversation with him.</p>\n<p>Then the guy reaches out and snatches the phone right out of Wade\u2019s fingers, board tucked under one arm, and taps <i>add new contact.</i> \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Did he just--]]</p>\n<p>[No fucking way.]</p>\n<p>Wade hits himself upside the head. Maybe something got wired back the wrong way and he\u2019s just hallucinating all this. \u201cI think that Kree Sentry did more damage than I first realised\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The guy pauses, brows pulled together and slight pout to his lips. He lays a hand on Wade\u2019s arm. \u201cI really wanted to thank you for that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou saved all our asses, and I know The Avengers weren\u2019t very gracious about it, but I really appreciate what you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Jesus, is this kid for real?]</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a curious prickling at the corner of Wade\u2019s eyes, which is fucking ridiculous. It\u2019s just...no one ever thanks Deadpool, whether it\u2019s those holier-than-thou douchebags under Stark\u2019s banner, or some rando getting the stick-up. Don\u2019t they realise he\u2019s not even getting <i>paid</i> for this shit? </p>\n<p>\u201cUh. Thanks?\u201d</p>\n<p>The guy hip-checks him and rolls his eyes up at Wade from under impossibly long lashes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say <i>you\u2019re welcome</i>,\u201d he says, singing the last bit, voice dropped into a lower register that still comes nowhere close to Dwayne Johnson. </p>\n<p>He turns his attention back to the phone, and Wade notices that he\u2019s hesitating over the field for his name. Finally, after several seconds, he types out <i>Peter</i> and gives Wade a smile that\u2019s trying to be a lot braver than it actually is. Wade\u2019s fingers are nerveless when Peter hands the phone back over, and he fumbles not to drop it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh\u2026\u201d Peter reaches up to tug at the straps of the bookbag on his shoulder. \u201cText me, maybe?\u201d There\u2019s a hopeful lilt to his voice, like he wants to be flirty but has no idea how to go about it. </p>\n<p>Wade has to remind himself that gaping open-mouthed, even in the mask, is not an attractive look. He closes his mouth with a sharp click and gives a nod. Neither he nor the boxes trust him to speak at the moment.</p>\n<p>Peter drops his board to the ground and climbs on with a graceful shift of balance that sends him off the path. \u201cSee ya later, \u2018Pool!\u201d he calls, with another little wave in parting. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s already gone before Wade can get his body to cooperate and wave back.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s sort of difficult to appreciate fine Mexican cuisine when the voices in your head won\u2019t shut the fuck up. Don\u2019t get it wrong, he\u2019s still gonna down all twenty of the waiting chilaquiles, because he didn\u2019t come all the fuck the way across town to let a little situational indigestion to stop him in his quest to stuff his face.</p>\n<p>But damn, he can\u2019t get that kid out of his mind.</p>\n<p>[[Peter]] White purrs helpfully.</p>\n<p>Yeah, and the whole thanking him for his services like he was a card carrying superhero or some shit. </p>\n<p>[[It <i>was</i> kinda nice for a change.]]</p>\n<p>And that isn\u2019t really up for debate, but it is definitely fucking with him. A more paranoid man might think someone was setting him up.</p>\n<p>[More paranoid than us?]</p>\n<p>[[It could happen.]] Whitey sounds sort of dubious about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cBet ya Wolvie woulda run him through before he managed to get a word in edgewise.\u201d The image makes Wade snort in amusement, but that quickly sours. </p>\n<p>The real problem, of course, is being reminded of the whole mess with the Kree and the Avengers. It\u2019s been almost a week, and since Wade was summarily kicked out by Tony Dickweed without so much as a thanks for the memories, he hasn\u2019t seen Spidey once. And thinking about Spidey just makes him feel a little guilty for ogling Peter.</p>\n<p>[Well, it\u2019s not like Spider-Man\u2019s going to be batting his pretty little lashes at you like. Ever.]</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso true,\u201d Wade says under his breath. He takes a giant chunk out of a chilaquile just to get rid of the bad taste in his mouth.</p>\n<p>The battle had been rough on the Avengers, all things considered. Wade\u2019s estimation of such things probably isn\u2019t the most reliable, given that no situation is ever going to be dire for <i>him</i>. But by the time he\u2019d shown up to the party with guns blazing, Scarlet Witch was already out of commission, Vision hovering over her like an overprotective dad--something to do with some Kree device that had rendered her powers useless and knocked her out. Stark was on his second suit of the battle, and it was covered in silvery gouges across the red and gold. </p>\n<p>\u2018Course Widow and Spider-Man somehow always managed to keep going and make it look effortless, even when the rest were showing signs of fatigue. Each off in their own little world with the Kree. Black Widow all lethal grace poured into black leather wringing one Kree neck with her thighs while catching another right between the eyes with a bullet, and Spider-Man cracking wise as he swung neatly through the grasping hands and death-rays with the greatest of ease, rounding them up with his webs. </p>\n<p>It had been easy for Deadpool to jump right into the rhythm they\u2019d established. As much as he\u2019d preferred fighting on his own in the past, some situations called for a team up. The more often he spent with Spidey at his side slinging quips as fast as he slung webs, the less fun it was without him.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d made a pretty sizeable dent, with Spider-Man routing the Kree and Sentry down the path towards Black Widow and Deadpool while they picked them off. Bullets worked well enough against the Kree themselves, but they weren\u2019t leaving a mark on the Sentry, who\u2019d gotten in more than one blow, sending Deadpool flying into the nearby skyscraper with enough force to crack the fa\u00e7ade.</p>\n<p>\u201cMight be time to call in the big guy,\u201d Natasha muttered under her breath, when they\u2019d fallen back, yet again giving more ground. The street was littered in blue bodies and streaks of red.</p>\n<p>Deadpool couldn\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t have called The Hulk in to begin with, but these goodie goodies and their misplaced ideas about minimal collateral damage. He shrugged. \u201cFine by me--less bullets to waste.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man flipped over to them, and that was just far too distracting to be allowed mid-battle. He gave them both a look that was unreadable under the mask, but Wade couldn\u2019t help but feel it was probably disapproving. \u201cThere\u2019s an access panel on it\u2019s back. I read about it on the S.W.O.R.D. database--I think I can hack it, if you guys can distract it for a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Black Widow gave him a shrewd look. \u201cJust casually browsing the S.W.O.R.D. database.\u201d And Deadpool didn\u2019t like that note of insinuation in her tone, maligning his boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, just stumbled over it,\u201d Spider-Man said airily, wiggling his fingers. Probably to indicate, who the fuck knew--hacking or some shit? But that was giving Deadpool a whole different sort of idea of where those fingers could be wiggling.</p>\n<p>[[Focus, Deadpool!]]</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatcha need from us, Baby Boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, stop calling me that,\u201d Spider-Man said. It was a totally perfunctory dismissal that\u2019d become more habit than actual annoyance, and Wade smiled goofily.</p>\n<p>[Yeah, it\u2019s fucking heart-warming. God you\u2019re pathetic.]</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond, just do whatever it takes to keep the Sentry\u2019s attention on you guys until I\u2019m done.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a sign of his trust that Spidey swung off before he got confirmation from them. </p>\n<p>[[At least, trust in Black Widow.]]</p>\n<p><i>Well then, let\u2019s show him he can trust us, too,</i> Deadpool growled back in his mind, and leapt into action with Black Widow. </p>\n<p>Distracting the Sentry was child\u2019s play. The exterior might have been damn near impenetrable, but for all that strength, the Kree didn\u2019t give it a very advanced artificial intelligence. And the thing was bulky and unwieldy as hell. All they had to do was get in close to lay down blows to hold its attention, and dodge the laser beams.</p>\n<p>A burst of gunfire caught Black Widow\u2019s attention, and then something must have come over her earpiece, because she nodded and said, \u201cCan you handle this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you joshing?\u201d Deadpool asked, dodging the metal fist that came down where he\u2019d just been standing. \u201cThis is small potatoes, babe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Black Widow rolled her eyes, but didn\u2019t hesitate a second longer before hurrying down the street where Iron Man was surrounded by a group of Kree on space scooters or some shit.</p>\n<p>Everything went fine for the first couple minutes, but then there was the sound of sizzling electricity and Spider-Man let out a yelp of surprise. It made Deadpool\u2019s hair stand on end, and he was already on the move towards Spider-Man\u2019s position without having to think about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine! I\u2019m fine!\u201d That was a different voice than Wade was used to, higher-pitched and much younger. something must\u2019ve got damaged in Spidey\u2019s mask. Spry little fucker did a backflip off the Sentry\u2019s back and stuck the landing. \u201cSelf-destruct sequence has a short fuse--get down!\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man had all these noble ideas, which was adorable but also just plain fucking stupid because his healing factor had nothing on Deadpool\u2019s. They made it a couple yards away, Deadpool putting himself between Spidey and the Sentry, before the thing went off in an explosion of fire and steel. The force of it carried them forward and they landed hard with Deadpool flattening Spidey to the ground. </p>\n<p>After a couple seconds of trying to draw a breath and being unable, the darkness receded a bit and Deadpool pushed himself up on hands and knees. Singed around the edges and it felt like maybe a broken rib or two, but those would heal within minutes. Deadpool might have taken the brunt of the fire, but Spider-Man had taken the impact of the fall. He scrambled to roll Spidey onto his back. </p>\n<p>[[Maybe we should do mouth to mouth]]</p>\n<p>[He\u2019s breathing already.]</p>\n<p>Yeah, there was a little rise and fall to Spidey\u2019s chest and Wade felt out his pulse, just under the edge of his mask. Not as strong as he\u2019d like. The fabric of the mask was black from whatever shorted wire Spidey had struck, looked like it had melted in places across his face and hair. The skin beneath was red from heat but it didn't look badly burnt. Wade peeled it away carefully just enough to bare Spider-Man\u2019s nose and mouth. </p>\n<p>\n<i>There, maybe he\u2019ll breath a little easier that way.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your hands off him, Wilson.\u201d Stark\u2019s voice rang out cold in the silence after the explosion.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool your shit, Kylo Ren,\u201d Wade snapped back. \"Just trying to help.\"</p>\n<p>Widow came rolling out from under a nearby SUV where she'd taken cover. \u201cHe did come in handy in the fight, Stark,\u201d she said. The last of the Kree were a smoking pile of alien blood and technology on the pavement just behind. Wade could appreciate a woman just as deadly and efficient as himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, thanks but no thanks,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need your help with the Kree and Spider-Man doesn\u2019t need your brand of <i>help</i> now, either.\u201d He landed hard and strode over, mask sliding back to reveal a stern scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Wade gritted his teeth as he got to shaky legs--oh yeah, there was the broken femur still slotting the shattered pieces back together. He held up his hands and took a step back, \u201cThanks for reminding me why I don\u2019t bat for your team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if we\u2019d have you,\u201d Stark said under his breath, but he was kneeling at Spider-Man\u2019s side, and that was where the majority of his attention was. Black Widow was talking to someone on the other end of her earbud about a medical team, and Vision floated down from the building he\u2019d stood upon, not so subtly angling his way between Deadpool and Spider-Man while Stark lifted his mask the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>Deadpool averted his gaze. As much as he\u2019d love to know the face behind the mask, it was clear from their past interaction that Spidey wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. Being respectful of another superhero\u2019s boundaries was important.</p>\n<p>[Since when do you give a dick about boundaries??]</p>\n<p>[[Since when the fuck are we a superhero?]]</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, I don\u2019t need this shit.\u201d It was as much for Yellow and White's benefit as it was for Iron Dick and Vision, who wasn\u2019t quite touching Wade yet with his outstretched hand shepherding him away. There was an anxious buzzing under his skin and his stomach turned sickly at the idea of just <i>leaving</i> when Spidey was still lying there motionless. But it wasn\u2019t like Stark was about to let him come back to their super NOT secret HQ and sit by his bedside.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust...tell Spidey to get better soon,\u201d Deadpool muttered.</p>\n<p>Stark gave him a look like he\u2019d just sprouted a dick out of his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho else is going to remind me not to unalive the civilians?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMorality and common decency?\u201d Stark suggested.</p>\n<p>[[Clearly he doesn\u2019t know the voices in your head\u2026]]</p>\n<p>Wade flipped the bird over his shoulder as he turned off and stumbled down the street. Black Widow fell in step beside him, surprisingly unscathed. \u201cYou gonna be alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Deadpool might normally be all about the concern from a hot little red head with a tightass body, but right now he just wasn\u2019t in the mood to be around other people, particularly not those associated with Tony Fucking Stark. He grunted noncommittally in response. He didn\u2019t like the way she was looking at him, like she could see right through his mask, and maybe even the skin beneath.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might take him a little longer than you to recover, but Spider-Man will be fine,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Deadpool agreed glumly. There was this stupid little fantasy playing itself out in his mind right now, of holding Spidey\u2019s hand while he convalesced, keeping him company instead of all those humourless dickbags. He\u2019d caught a glimpse of brown hair and pale skin behind that mask, before he\u2019d snapped his eyes shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony\u2019s just really protective of him,\u201d Black Widow continued. \u201cStill thinks of him as a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>And thanks for reminding him of the fact that basically all of <i>them</i> knew Spidey\u2019s secret identity, had apparently known it all along, and Wade was the one asshole left in the dark. They could team up all the liked, but it was clear where Spider-Man\u2019s loyalty was.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well if he was that worried, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have put a <i>kid</i> in a costume and sent him off to fight,\u201d Wade snapped back. And look, it wasn\u2019t like Wade wasn\u2019t aware of the fact that Spidey had to be young. Even with his silly little voice modulator, he wasn\u2019t kidding anyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-Man is a big boy, and he can make his own choices, like everyone else here.\u201d There was something suggestive in her tone that Wade couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on. \u201cAnyway, thanks for the assist.\u201d She punctuated her words with a super brotastic shoulder bump that actually sent Wade staggering. He let out a hiss, his hand coming up instinctively to protect the burn that was sluggishly healing itself there.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck--don\u2019t you have somebody to be crushing to death with your thighs right about now, Famke?\u201d</p>\n<p>[Oooh, now there would have been a nice piece of casting!]</p>\n<p>[[But then who would play Jean Grey.]]</p>\n<p>\n<i>I prefer Scar-Jo anyway.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, go rub some dirt on it,\u201d Black Widow said. Wade didn\u2019t think he was imagining the softening around her eyes, though, almost like fondness. Take that, Iron Dildo. Deadpool would just win them over one by one on his own, thank you very fucking much.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the same as dat Spidey-Ass, but Wade wasn\u2019t about to let the opportunity of Black Widow\u2019s swaying hips just walk away from him unnoticed.</p>\n<p>[[Keep making excuses for your horndog ass. First Black Widow and now <i>Peter</i>]]</p>\n<p>[The professed love of your life could be wasting away in a Shield laboratory and you\u2019re lusting over some barely legal coed.]</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t fair that shoving more food in his mouth doesn\u2019t shut the boxes up. It\u2019s almost enough to make a guy lose his appetite. He really needs to go stab some bad guys to distract himself. There\u2019s that suspected Hydra warehouse Spidey had been surveilling before shit went down with the Kree. Seems like as good an opportunity as any to take his mind off things.</p>\n<p>[And hey, one less thing for Spidey to worry about when he gets back!]</p>\n<p>[[I doubt he\u2019ll see it that way\u2026]]</p>\n<p>Nothing like slaughtering Nazis wholesale to cheer a reformed mercenary\u2019s soul. </p>\n<p>The place is locked down tighter than a cat\u2019s asshole. Deadpool\u2019s a little suspicious. He\u2019s taken hits on Hydra agents in the past, and for a super secret underground organisation pulling the strings of, like, every world government, they had hilariously lax security. Makes him think there might be something else going on here.</p>\n<p>The whole information gathering deal has never been his strength. As far back as the second grade, when he and Lark Bryant decided to steal the answers for the science test, he\u2019s always been on hand to be the lookout, the distraction, and later the muscle.</p>\n<p>Killing everyone is so much easier than trying to figure out what these apparent Hydra scientists are up to in the lab. Maybe not as satisfying as the ones that can fight back, but beggers can\u2019t be choosers.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in the elevator heading up to clear another floor when there\u2019s a loud thunk on the roof of the car. Deadpool lifts his gun, ready to shoot through the metal, but familiar red-gloved fingers peek around the edge of the access panel.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey--so good to see you out heroing again, man--fancy seeing you here!\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man drops down into the elevator, arms crossed over his chest, the white slits of his eyes narrowed. Daddy Stark got his suit all fixed up again, complete with his voice modulator. \u201cYou mean because of how I\u2019ve been running recon on this place for a goddamn <i>month</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh that was <i>this</i> Hydra facility?\u201d Deadpool says.</p>\n<p>\"You came by to annoy me while I was here just last Friday!\u201d Spidey puts a hand to his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m out of commission for less than a week, and you go off the rails.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Ha! That\u2019s cute!]]</p>\n<p>[Like your entire life hasn\u2019t been off the rails...]</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you believe me if I said I was trying to help?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d believe you\u2019re shitty at helping,\u201d Spider-Man mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the <i>best</i> at helping, Spidey,\u201d Wade declares excitedly. \u201cJust point me in the right direction and tell me who to unalive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow am I going to get any answers if everyone\u2019s dead?\u201d Spidey exclaims. He gives Deadpool a lingering look, then says, sotto voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve already killed everyone, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust on the bottom three floors,\u201d Wade says. He crosses his finger over his heart in an \u2018X.\u2019 It\u2019s seriously impressive how Spidey manages to look so dubious through his mask. \u201cAnd maybe set some explosive charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man sighs. \u201cAnd here I was trying to stick up for you with Iron Man\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>[[Aw, his ire almost sounds affectionate!]]</p>\n<p>The elevator dings cheerfully when they arrive on sub-level 2 and Spider-Man strides out. He stops after a couple steps and casts a glance over his shoulder. \u201cYou coming?\u201d Wade practically skips after him. \u201cNo more unaliving, though! I need to be able to talk to them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo when you\u2019re done\u2026?\u201d Wade asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at <i>all</i>, Wade.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Wade trails off, pouting. \u201cNazis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not even Spider-Man can make an argument against that, apparently, because he stops trying. Maybe because he\u2019s focussed on the room numbers and labels they pass. Things like <i>Nerve and Muscle Regeneration</i> and <i>Pressure Vessels</i> and <i>Extreme Environmental Deprivation</i>.</p>\n<p>[[I don\u2019t like where this is going\u2026]]</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Spidey, you know genetic experimentation always makes my trigger finger a little twitchy.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Everything makes your trigger finger twitchy.]</p>\n<p>[[Trigger warning--heh, clever on multiple levels!]]</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Spider-Man mutters. \u201cCap asked me to take a look on the DL. If Shield knew, they\u2019d just sweep in overnight and wipe all trace of the operation off the face of the planet, but who knows what they\u2019d do with what they found.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, Spidey, I think I\u2019m supposed to be the cynical one in this relationship,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe that\u2019s not entirely fair. There is a long and storied list on Deadpool\u2019s part, with Tony Stark and Wade\u2019s own issues with authority at the top, in bright, bold red ink. Spider-Man has fewer problems with the team all around, but the reason the two of them get along so well is the same reason neither of them really fits in with the rest of the good guys.</p>\n<p>[[Whether or not <i>we\u2019re</i> the good guys is debatable\u2026]]</p>\n<p>Wade considers the bodies strewn across the floor downstairs, the blood splatter on the wall.</p>\n<p>[Gold star; you tried.]</p>\n<p>Spider-Man tsks. \u201cCome on, son, you know my cynicism is why there even <i>is</i> a relationship. That and my razor sharp wit.\u201d He pauses, and smiles cheekily, or at least Wade likes to imagine what the expression under the mask is like. Probably with stupidly soft, gorgeous, pillow-like lips. Deadpool had been a bit too distracted by the whole making-sure-Spider-Man-was-breathing deal to pay much attention when he saw them first hand, but he has a vivid imagination.</p>\n<p>[[He said <i>relationship</i>!!!]]</p>\n<p>[I think that\u2019s like, tacit approval for ass-grabbing.]</p>\n<p><i>Though maybe not in the middle of a mission.</i> Wade tilts his head to the side speculatively, as Spidey continues on down the hall unawares. Well, probably not unawares--he has been working alongside Wade long enough to know where and how often his mind wanders. </p>\n<p>[Oooh, you should totally write Daddy Stark a thank you for designing those tights!]</p>\n<p>Wade giggles out loud at the thought and earns a shushing sound from Spider-Man, but it\u2019s so true. That blue spandex leaves nothing to the imagination. Wade has spent a lot of time wondering--okay fantasising--about the guy behind the mask, and what sort of routine he has going on that keeps his ass so tight and pert but still full enough for Wade to really get a handful, with the shallow dip where hip meets thigh, and damn if those tights don\u2019t hug every single curve and swell. Especially when he\u2019s climbing the walls, with his booty all popped out like he\u2019s just begging for Wade to fit up against him just right\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<i>Well. Maybe a little squeeze couldn\u2019t hurt.</i>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a testament to Spidey\u2019s professionalism that he doesn\u2019t even jump when Wade cops a feel.</p>\n<p>[[Or maybe he\u2019s just used to your perversion.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called <i>affection</i>,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you maybe show it some other time?\u201d Spider-Man hisses back, smacking his hand away.</p>\n<p>Wade presses closer, just for Spidey to get a brief feel of them back to front, and whispers, \u201cBaby boy, I\u2019ll show you any way, any time. And just to be clear, I\u2019m a shower <i>and</i> a grower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, Wade,\u201d Spidey says, but he doesn\u2019t pull away right away, which is as good as consent. Wade can feel the tension thrumming in the muscles beneath his hands where they rest on Spider-Man\u2019s hips. His thumb swipes across that little dip. Spidey drops his head back to thump against Wade\u2019s chest, and for just a second, his whole body seems to <i>melt</i> back into Wade\u2019s. \u201c<i>Later</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>And, okay, Wade <i>knows</i>, he <i>knows</i> Spider-Man doesn\u2019t mean it like that. Not in the way that goes straight to Wade\u2019s dick with promise. And it shouldn\u2019t even sound so goddamn sexy with that stupid voice-modulator, and yet. Here he is, following along like a stray puppy looking for any scrap Spidey tosses out, helplessly turned on by even the suggestion that he might have a chance.</p>\n<p>[Pa. The. Tic.]</p>\n<p>Which goes without saying\u2026</p>\n<p>Spider-Man pushes off again, and Deadpool stays close at heel. The lab he\u2019s looking for is ominously unlabelled. If Deadpool had a special sense like Spider-Man\u2019s, it would be a-tinglin\u2019. There are three scientists inside, and as soon as they look up and see company, they start scrambling to grab what they\u2019re working on and throw it in the incinerator. </p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t anyone ever teach you not to play with fire?\u201d Spidey calls after them. A second later they\u2019re all three webbed to the spot, with their notes scattered all over the floor. Spider-Man slams the incinerator shut and plucks one of the papers up. \u201cI have a few burning questions for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deadpool likes to imagine himself coming up with all sorts of sassy and threatening phrases worthy of a Tarantino film, but the sad fact is that the scientists just give it up seeing him standing there at Spider-Man\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>All the work they\u2019ve be doing on mind control techniques, or menticide, as these tool bags keep calling it. No wonder Cap was so interested in the facility. And with all the trouble Barnes has caused, both between the Avengers and in the legal system, of course Hydra is looking to take it further, which explains the trail of dead guards Deadpool left behind. But shame on Hydra not training their scientists better--seriously, he hadn\u2019t even had to torture them a little bit, first.<br>\nSpidey webs them up good and tight and then destroys everything in the lab except for a couple of handwritten notebooks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019d be easier if you let me just blow the place. All you gotta do is give the word,\u201d Wade says winningly. \u201cYou said yourself what Shield might do if they got ahold of this stuff. Like they wouldn\u2019t just disappear those scientists into a cell somewhere like they did with Cap\u2019s dream team after the whole Bucky incident?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to,\u201d Spider-Man says. \u201cI\u2019m giving it to Steve. And we\u2019re not going to go around killing people because it\u2019s <i>easier</i>, Wade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think that was easy?\u201d Wade says, indignant, gesturing at the floor below them. \u201cI forgot my ammo bag again, I lost my right ear, and one of those assholes stabbed me in the thigh. We\u2019re talking mere inches from Little Wade!\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man\u2019s gaze flicks down to the spot where Deadpool\u2019s suit is torn from said stab wound. Though the skin has closed now, it\u2019s pink and brand-new, and visible through the gash on the inside of his thigh. \u201cPoor baby,\u201d he cooes.</p>\n<p>Deadpool wiggles his brows and sidles close, pitching his voice low. \u201cWanna kiss it better?\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him a sharp jab to the spot, and Spidey\u2019s gleeful \u201coops\u201d as he slips free and makes for the elevator. \u201cCome on, help me drop these off and then I\u2019ll treat you to gelato to make up for it?\u201d Deadpool considers the scientists, watching them like they\u2019re the crazy ones--</p>\n<p>[[Well, we are.]]</p>\n<p>And really there are far better ways to be spending his evening than cleaning their blood off his blades. They fight their way out, leaving a pile of unconscious and/or webbed scientists and guards in their wake, and it might not be the same as killing Nazis, but it <i>is</i> with Spidey at his side, so that\u2019s basically just as awesome.</p>\n<p>True to his promise, Spider-Man meets up with Captain America. Deadpool sticks to the shadows, and don\u2019t think he misses the fact that Cap has his own shadow or two--the Winter Soldier lingering in the dark of an alley, and another dark figure on a fire escape overlooking the exchange. Maybe they\u2019ll do what needs done back at the Hydra base.</p>\n<p>After they part, it\u2019s back uptown for gelato, at Spidey\u2019s favourite place. They\u2019ve been there so many times the workers and clientele don\u2019t even double-take anymore when two masked vigilantes stroll in to place an order. </p>\n<p>Deadpool pointedly averts his gaze when Spidey lifts his mask up to his nose to eat. One of these days his patience is going to pay off, and Spidey\u2019s going to realise he\u2019s trustworthy enough to take it the rest of the way off.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for your help,\u201d Spider-Man says, when they\u2019re sitting on a rooftop overlooking the park. \u201cI mean, I probably could have done it without you--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Deadpool asks, knocking their shoulders together.</p>\n<p>\u201cFun, right,\u201d Spidey scoffs. </p>\n<p>[[Definitely affectionate.]]</p>\n<p>Spidey doesn\u2019t move away, just leans his head on Deadpool\u2019s shoulder, and Deadpool goes rigid beneath the touch, afraid to shift or even breathe, because then Spidey might <i>move</i> or pull away, or think Wade doesn\u2019t want him. He doesn\u2019t know what possesses him, in that moment, to say, \u201cThis really hot guy gave me his number today.\u201d </p>\n<p>[Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you??]</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Spider-Man asks. He straightens up to look Wade in the face.</p>\n<p>[[Way to kill the moment, Douchepool.]]</p>\n<p>Because Wade apparently hates himself, and can\u2019t have anything nice, he adds, \u201cI think he asked me on a date?\u201d That part is still sort of confusing. Okay. The whole thing is still pretty confusing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should probably call him, then.\u201d He sounds...excited? Happy? Either way, it fucking sucks, because Spidey isn\u2019t supposed to be happy that some other guy wants to date Wade. Maybe, no matter how far-fetched it is, he was hoping Spidey might be jealous.</p>\n<p>[Keep dreaming, loser.]</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man hops to his feet, still full of boundless energy, and brushes off his suit. \u201cI\u2019ve got an early day tomorrow--gonna catch a few hours of z\u2019s.\u201d He pauses at the edge of the roof, ready to swing off, and shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cIt <i>was</i> fun, DP,\u201d he says, and jumps into the night.</p>\n<p>Wade watches him swing gracefully from roof to roof until he\u2019s disappeared into the distance. All flirting aside, Spidey couldn\u2019t be any clearer, telling him to go for it with someone else. If Wade were the sort to wallow in self-pity, he\u2019d never be able to pull himself out from under the long enough to get out of bed.</p>\n<p>He takes his phone from its pocket on his suit and thumbs through to Peter\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>In the end, it takes Wade a while to muster up the courage to text Peter. He composes about half a dozen unfinished messages, deleting each one in disgust before he can press <i>send</i>. Maybe in the moment it seemed like a good idea, texting Peter as some fucked up (and ineffective) way of getting back at Spider-Man. But at home, surrounded by the hot pile of garbage that is his life, it\u2019s all too obvious that there\u2019s no place in it for some hottie science nerd college kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust fucking do something already,\u201d Al grouches at him sometime around noon the next day. \u201cYour pity-party is so loud I can\u2019t nap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know being blind just enhances all your regular senses, it doesn\u2019t actually make you a mind-reader.\u201d</p>\n<p>Al gives him a knowing look, one brow quirked as if to say <i>oh really</i>, and Wade has to reevaluate. She has a whole life he knows nothing about, from before they met, and it would explain a lot of eerie prescience, but\u2026</p>\n<p>[There\u2019s no way she\u2019d still be here if she could hear all the freaky shit that goes on inside our head.]</p>\n<p>[[Unless she\u2019s <i>into</i> it.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew this was just your long game seduction plan to get get a piece of this sugar baby ass--\u201d Wade is cut off abruptly by Al snatching the phone from his hand. They wrestle briefly, while Al taps out a message one handed. \u201cI\u2019m lacing all your food with Visine and leaving Blair\u2019s hot sauce on the toilet seat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Al throws the phone back at him with a smirk. \u201cIf the payoff is not having to clean your jizz off the couch for the 900th time, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re really underestimating my refractory period, there. By the way, you missed the spot where you\u2019re sitting.\u201d Wade glances down at the message she\u2019s typed out. \u201cHow the frick--\u201d Wade demands suspiciously, mouth dropped open in disbelief. \u201cHow did you even write that?\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Do you have any proof she\u2019s actually blind?]]</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d rely on you for <i>anything</i> if I had any other choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Are we sure she\u2019s not a mind-reader??]</p>\n<p>Just in case, Wade lets the voices run wild with the most demented shit they can conjure up, in retaliation for the texts she\u2019s sent.</p>\n<p>\n<i>my roommate was gonna start testing my regenerative powers if i didn\u2019t stop pining and ask you out </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>this is wade btw</i>\n</p>\n<p>Peter is already typing a response, and Wade awaits it in dread, but all that finally appears is <i>I was starting to think you were never gonna text me</i> Wade stares in disbelief until the next text pops up. <i>Just finished my last class, I neeeeeed caffeine. There\u2019s a place nearby my apartment that has the most amazing dark roast with black pepper. It\u2019s grounds for celebration.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with this kid\u2019s head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you\u2019d know,\u201d Al mutters.</p>\n<p>Wade has never in his life angsted so hard over what to wear, like a kid on prom night. He doesn\u2019t usually go out in full-on Deadpool suit for day to day living, but Peter--even if he knows who Wade is, that doesn\u2019t mean he knows about the horror show under the mask. On the other hand, maybe seeing Wade in all his horrifying glory will wake the kid the fuck up.</p>\n<p>So he compromises. His Team Instinct tank top with a hoodie on over it so he doesn\u2019t scare off any little kiddies. It lets him hide his face in the shadow without suffocating in the early autumn heat. Of course there are still plenty of rude fuckers who stare on the train, but Deadpool isn\u2019t above flashing the magnum he\u2019s got tucked in the waistband of his jeans.</p>\n<p>\n<i>And for once, I don\u2019t mean my dick.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Or do I\u2026?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Then he gets there, and actually sees Peter standing outside the coffee shop, and is reminded of how stupidly hot the kid is. Golden skin, hair mussed like he just rolled out of bed with a little curl across his forehead, body leaned against the wall like a fucking invitation with his hips canted outward, feet spread, shoulders lax, eyes closed.</p>\n<p>Peter's wearing glasses today, and apparently he\u2019s one of the lucky ones who somehow manages to look even hotter with them. Wearing another one of his science shirts with a zombie cat popping out of a cardboard box proclaiming, \u201cThe cat is UNDEAD!\u201d this time without a hoodie, and Wade hadn\u2019t anticipated those arms, okay? Petey must work out, because those are some serious guns he\u2019s carrying, all long, slender, elegant muscle unlike Wade\u2019s bulk. It\u2019s unfairly hot.</p>\n<p>Wade is considering just splitting when Peter straightens up and opens his eyes, finding him staring from across the street like he\u2019s got some sixth sense for it. Peter smiles, which one, shows recognition, and two, that he\u2019s not phased by what he sees.</p>\n<p>[[It might be time to consider that he\u2019s a plant...]]</p>\n<p>\n<i>Definitely starting to fall under the \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d category.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Peter asks, when he draws nearer. His mouth splits with a yawn, and covers his mouth. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m exhausted after last night. Almost fell asleep in lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wade agrees, \u201cI remember those late night study sessions.\u201d Peter gives him a strange look, part confused, part suspicious. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m full of shit, I never attended a day of college in my life. Unless you count all the times I was paid to rough up jackhole frat guys who didn\u2019t understanding the meaning of the word <i>no</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a bro,\u201d Peter says. \u201cCareful, DP, or word\u2019s going to get around about what a softy you really are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently word already <i>is</i> around, if Peter considered him safe to approach in the first place. Now if Tony Stank and his buddies at Shield could just get with the program and get off his dick. While they wait in line, Wade considers the likelihood of any of the Avengers actually believing Peter was here of his own free will, or if they'd just assume Wade kidnapped him.</p>\n<p>Which, fair enough...</p>\n<p>Wade has never been one for artisanal coffee. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he enjoys it as much as the next guy, but he never got the fuss when the day old dreck in his coffee maker gets the job done just as well. Peter\u2019s right about this peppery blend, however, it is the shit. They take theirs to go and Peter leads the way through the crowded sidewalks outside as gracefully on foot as on his skateboard.</p>\n<p>Peter takes a sip from his coffee and makes another sinful noise of appreciation. \u201cUgh, I so needed that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what\u2019cha studying?\u201d Wade asks, before the silence can grow super awkward.</p>\n<p>\"Well, science stuff, obviously,\" Peter answers with an eye roll like Wade already knew that. \u201cBut I honestly haven\u2019t decided between Biochemistry and Molecular Biology or Neurobiology, and I have to admit in my circumstances, Evolutionary Biology has more than a little appeal.\" Peter shrugs. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d just rather do them all--it\u2019s not like Mister Stark or Bruce Banner limited themselves to one field of study--but May worries about me being too stressed, between school, work, and...extracurriculars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a legit nerd, then,\u201d Wade says. His brain sort of went off-line after <i>Biochemistry</i>, but it sounds pretty smarty-pants.</p>\n<p>\"Has that been in question to this point?\" Peter holds up his hand in a Vulcan salute. \u201cLight sabre-carrying, pipboy-wearing, lego-building dork.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wade says, considering. \u201cBest Star Wars Episode?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter answers without hesitation. \u201cFive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInteresting choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Empire Strikes Back is like, one of, if not the most iconic films of all time, and I will <i>fight</i> you on this.\u201d Peter starts ticking points off on his fingers as he speaks. \u201cThe Battle of Hoth alone is a wonder of special effects that still holds up over thirty years later, plus the scoring, holy shit. And the whole back and forth between Leia and Han ending in that iconic \u2018I love you\u2019/\u2019I know\u2019 exchange? And talking about iconic lines, like, can you even imagine what it was like in theatres the first time everyone heard \u2018Luke, I am your father.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, the line is \u2018I\u2019m your father,\u2019\u201d Wade corrects. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to imagine--<i>did</i> see it in theatres, thank you very much for highlighting the age difference here, Mister Jail-Bait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Peter waves him off. \u201cThe point remains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just frankly relieved that you didn\u2019t try to lecture me about the comedic genius of Jar-Jar Binks, you freakin\u2019 toddler.\u201d </p>\n<p>Peter punches him in the shoulder <i>hard</i>, holy shit. \u201cThat\u2019s just fucking rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade can\u2019t help but laugh at his indignant expression. \u201cAlright, alright. Favourite Trek?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter scoffs. \u201cNext Gen,\u201d he says, like there\u2019s any other answer.</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s lips pull into a scowl. \u201cClearly DS9, but we\u2019ve just established that you\u2019re practically an infant, so I\u2019ll give you time to come around.\u201d Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cFavorite character lightning round: BSG?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOriginal or reboot?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cReboot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Starbuck, clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Wade agrees. \u201cKara Thrace can kick my ass any day.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes please.\u201d Peter nods his head and they bump fists. </p>\n<p>\u201cThough I do feel a personal affinity for Gaius,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>Peter laughs. \u201cAre the voices in your head secretly a hot Cylon babe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>wish</i>,\u201d Wade says. \u201cDC?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like I should say Batman, but it\u2019s gotta be Riddler.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade strokes his chin. \u201cHarry Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, you are old,\" Peter grimaces. \"I bet you\u2019re one of those weirdos who still takes house quizzes on Buzzfeed.\" He eyeballs Wade. \"Which I'd guess are about 40-60 Hufflepuff and Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade is taken aback, and more than a little smitten. \u201cMost people would probably guess Slytherin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith all your charging headfirst into danger regardless of threat of dismemberment or death? Sticking around your allies even when the heroes and press are dickheads? Stupidly brave and loyal.\u201d Peter\u2019s smile is soft and fond. And Wade. Wade doesn\u2019t know how to <i>take</i> this kid--this complete stranger, really, who seems to know him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wade says. This one\u2019ll stump him. \u201cBest episode of Golden Girls?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that really <i>nerdy</i>?\u201d Peter asks, giving him the side eye. \"Just because you're obsessed with it?\"</p>\n<p>So okay, maybe Peter was a stalker. \u201cNo stalling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs, eyes rolled upwards in consideration, before he finally says, \u201c<i>The Case of the Libertine Belle</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, I think you mean <i>It\u2019s a Miserable Life,</i>, but more importantly, are you, like, an evil cyborg or, brainwashed by Hydra, or\u2026\u201d Wade is cut off by Peter\u2019s giggle, and holy shit, he even <i>laughs</i> adorably.</p>\n<p>\u201cI take it I passed?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith flying colours,\u201d Wade mumbles.</p>\n<p>[Would it be rude to stick a needle in him to make sure he bleeds red on the first date?]</p>\n<p>A couple townies walking the opposite way down the street purposefully bump into Wade, snickering when he spills some of his coffee. Peter looks between them and Wade, whose hand is inching toward his waistband.</p>\n<p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d Peter calls over his shoulder, flips them off, and loops his arm through Wade\u2019s. \u201cHey, come on.\u201d He gives a tug, trying to get Wade\u2019s attention back on him. \u201cYou could go kick their asses, <i>or</i> you could come back to my place and teach me why I\u2019m so wrong about Next Gen. I\u2019ve been meaning to do a rewatch of DS9 anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Major Kira <i>is</i> the finest Trek character ever created,\u201d Wade says by rote, though his attention is still mostly on the dbags that are now joking about how apparently twinks dig the burn victim look.</p>\n<p>\u201cFormer militia with a chip on her shoulder and a problem with authority, and she looks super hot in a skin-tight red uniform? Hmmm\u2026\u201d Peter says, and taps a finger to his chin. \u201cNow why does that sound so familiar?\u201d He gives a firmer tug on Wade\u2019s arm in the opposite direction. The kid is deceptively strong for his height and build.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and I suppose you\u2019re more the Wesley Crusher sort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTeenage geniuses never get the appreciation they deserve,\u201d Peter says breezily.</p>\n<p>Wade allows Peter to lead him away, to a trendy looking walkup nearby the N train. \u201cI cleaned and everything,\u201d Peter says, as he lets them in the door. \u201cAnd by cleaned, I mean shoved all the laundry and random shit lying around in my linen closet--don\u2019t open the door if you value your life.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s cramped but fairly tidy with modern appliances, and frankly more than he\u2019d expect a college-aged kid to afford on his own. One whole wall of his tiny living room is taken up by a giant television screen and his gaming set up. Wade lets out a low whistle.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says, \u201cthe Stark Internship pays pretty well.\u201d He says it in a joking, off-handed, casual sort of way.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all starting to make sense. If Peter is smart enough to have qualified for a paid internship at Stark Industries--and to understand all that sciency stuff that Stark and Banner go on about--maybe he\u2019s worked with them on some Avenger-related project. Hell, it\u2019s entirely possible Wade already met him at some point when he showed up to annoy Tony. It would explain the familiarity on Peter\u2019s part. Though he still thinks he\u2019d remember that face. Not to mention that ass...</p>\n<p>They make it through a couple of episodes before their stomachs start growling in unison and then they have an intense rock paper scissors battle over Vietnamese vs Pizza for delivery. Then starting the next episode devolves into an argument over whether Kai Winn or Gul Dukat is more evil, which rages on over food.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Maybe he\u2019s not a spy. Maybe I\u2019m just hallucinating it all.</i>\n</p>\n<p>[Odds of anyone other than Vanessa actually being into your raggedy ass are exceedingly low\u2026]</p>\n<p>[[No need pining for Spidey and how he\u2019s never going to love us back when you can just make up the perfect boyfriend in your head.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d Peter lays a hand on Wade\u2019s. \u201cIs Six stealing your attention away from me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say the thought that this is <i>all</i>,\u201d the pizza dangles perilously from Wade's hand as he waves it around to encompass Peter, the apartment, all of it, \u201csome elaborate hallucination on my part has crossed my mind more than once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter clucks his tongue and gives Wade a dubious look. \u201cI'd offer to smack you across the face, but I think you'd like it and I'm not sure it'd prove anything to you, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy goodness, Peter,\u201d Wade exclaims in faux shock, one hand to clutched against his chest. \u201cOn the first date? What kind of girl do you think I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>A blush colours Peter's cheeks and it takes a second for Wade's brain to catch up and realise he just called this a date. Peter ducks his head, pleased smile tucked into his shoulder, and says, \u201cSeriously, Deadpool, I'm pretty sure everyone in the city knows what kind of girl you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade covers his panic with a blas\u00e9 shrug. \u201cFair enough.\u201d He throws back his shoulders and turns his face to the side, patting his left cheek. \u201cJust don't go for my good side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sits up straighter, licking pizza grease off his fingertips and wipes them on his jeans. He wriggles closer on the sofa, turns to face Wade more fully, legs all folded up beneath him, and lifts his hand like he's actually gonna go through with it.</p>\n<p>Wade can't say what's braver\u2014actually considering hitting <i>Deadpool</i> or willingly touching his bare skin. He almost jumps when Peter makes contact. Just the warm press of his palm against Wade's jaw, fingers giving the slightest pressure to angle his face upward. His breath catches in his throat and his body doesn't seem to want to ever exhale again when Peter leans in and brushes his lips across Wade's cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Pete says, biting his bottom lip as he leans back against the arm of the sofa. Smiling like he hasn't just managed to render Wade speechless. Staring in wide-eyed disbelief, skin tingling from the memory of the touch, and it's been <i>so long</i> since anyone's touched him so gently. \u201cIf you were hallucinating, we both know you'd have me putting out on the first date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is pretty fucking perfect, that goes without saying.</p>\n<p>There aren\u2019t a whole lotta people who can put up with Wade; the very short list is mostly made up of those who knew him before Deadpool, and those who are just as fucked up as he is, in their own ways. \u2018Course there are exceptions, like Spidey, who takes his rambling in stride and then rambles right back, but...Spidey <em>is</em> a mutant or something, and they don\u2019t tend to be the most mentally together people.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Which is what makes it particularly rich when Silver Member tries to start lecturing on mental health. While living in Mutant Grooming Manor, no less.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Peter is normal, though, so Wade\u2019s more than a little shocked when he texts Wade to hang out again. He\u2019s still waiting for the other shoe to drop, and keeps looking over his shoulder on the way, like maybe someone\u2019s decided to reopen Weapon X studies, or maybe Tony Stark\u2019s gonna pop up and accuse him of molesting innocents or something.</p>\n<p>They meet up again for a monster movie marathon in the Village, and are two of only a small handful that make it through all 9 films. Peter sneaks in every flavour of Mountain Dew known to mankind, along with red vines and seven layer dip combos, and Wade sneaks in enough vodka to kill a horse, and they sit in the back, snickering and joking over the dialogue like their own personal Mystery Science Theatre.</p>\n<p>Sometime around movie number three, Peter rests his cheek on Wade's shoulder. Wade can\u2019t help but think of Spidey doing the same on the rooftop the other night, and then he misses the next half hour of the movie while he has several different, simultaneous freakouts--what is he even doing here with someone as perfect as Peter? What is he even doing here when he\u2019s already in love with someone as perfect as Spider-Man?</p>\n<p>[[That one\u2019s easy--he already made it clear how he feels about you dating other people.]]</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the question of what, exactly, Peter thinks is going on here? Like sure, he keeps <em>calling</em> these dates, plus there\u2019s the kiss to the cheek that Wade can\u2019t even think about because every time he does his brain goes off line with the refusal to believe it actually <em>happened</em>. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019s hallucinated this week.</p>\n<p>But, supposing it did happen, that doesn\u2019t mean this is a date. Kids these days, so comfortable with their sexuality and showing physical affection--who the fuck knows, right? So maybe he\u2019s just a giant creep who\u2019s reading way too much into this whole situation.</p>\n<p>Sometime after movie number four Wade finally gets fed up with the argument waging in his head and throws caution to the wind, and wraps an arm around Peter to draw him nearer. Peter let's put a contented little sigh and snuggles closer.</p>\n<p>It's mid-morning on Sunday when the marathon ends, and it's a misty grey day, like autumn finally set in overnight. Peter draws his arms in his hoodie sleeves and huddles in on himself to keep warm. He stands there waiting, expectant, with his face tilted upward and Wade...</p>\n<p>Wade is <em>not</em> the picture of restraint, okay? He can't even remember the last time he had someone who actually wanted him, who he wasn't paying for the privilege. Even Vanessa started that way, and that was back when he could've been on the cover of GQ. And Wade never held it against any of them, but this, this was something new.\nPeter's skin is flushed beneath Wade's palm when he cups his cheek. Brown eyes smudged in dark shadow, red from exhaustion, but still bright and attentive, widening slightly when Wade leans in, before fluttering closed altogether.</p>\n<p>Fuck, Peter's skin is soft, lips plush and full. His mouth is a balm against Wade's. Peter's lips part on an exhale, enough for their mouths to fit together just right, and he tastes sweetly of strawberry and Arctic Blast Mountain Dew. Before Wade can even process the sensation, or take a moment to wonder whether it's a good idea or not, he's licking into Peter's mouth for a proper taste, past the slick part of his teeth and across his palate.</p>\n<p>Peter makes a faint sound of surprise that melts into a moan of appreciation, and suddenly his hands are everywhere. Running up Wade's arms to guide them around Peter's waist, up to Wade's shoulders to haul him closer, winding around his neck to cup the base of his skull. Peter kisses back with an enthusiasm that is intoxicating. Wade can't help but meet it with his own, hands clasped in the back of Peter's hoodie, body crowding into the last sliver of space between them as his tongue draws along Peter's. Anything to hear another one of those shivery little moans that go straight to his dick.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Finally</em>,\u201d Peter breathes, when they part.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's only the second date!\u201d Wade protests, which might be the most ridiculous thing that's ever come from his mouth.</p>\n<p><em>And that's saying something</em>.</p>\n<p>Peter arches a brow and smiles, a look that's equal parts amusement and ridicule. His mouth is red from kissing, a tempting sight. Wade just wants to sink his teeth into that swollen bottom lip and see how much it gives. Peter licks his lips like he can read Wade's thoughts and pulls him in for a second kiss.</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DuuIjYlUcAAttKW.jpg:large\" alt=\"Spideypool by cervinelich\" width=\"900\" height=\"1200\">\n</p>\n<p>Beneath his hand Peter's body practically hums, and it isn't until Peter makes a distressed sound and pulls away that Wade realises it's the phone in his hoodie pocket vibrating. Peter disentangles himself just enough to free it and swipe the screen up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat's up?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Standing as close together as they are, Wade can almost make out what the guy on the other end is saying. A low-pitched, growly voice saying he needs Peter's help and he'll text the details.</p>\n<p>Peter sighs and pulls away altogether, swiping a hand through his hair. \u201cOkay, I gotta run home and change. I'll meet you up after.\u201d He ends the call and gives Wade a weary look. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d He shakes the phone in Wade\u2019s direction. \u201cWanna come?\u201d</p>\n<p>What a strange kid. Wade can only imagine that it\u2019s either something to do with his internship, or something to do with school, and either way, Wade isn\u2019t going to be any help. \u201cNah, I think you\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s brow furrows, mouth parted in disbelief like he\u2019s caught off-guard and doesn\u2019t know how to respond to that.</p>\n<p>[[Oh look, you\u2019ve finally found someone as co-dependant as you!]]</p>\n<p>[I\u2019m honestly not sure if this is cute or pathetic.]</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter finally says, drawing out the syllables. Then he laughs it off with the shake of his head and steps back into Wade\u2019s personal space. He goes up on his toes to press a chaste kiss to the corner of Wade's mouth. \u201cRain check?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter takes off down the street, and Wade is left alone with his thoughts, which is never a good thing.</p>\n<p>What the fuck is he <em>doing</em>? Sure, the kid is hot as hell, and funny, but...</p>\n<p>[You're not still carrying that torch for Spidey?]</p>\n<p>[[Dude, we have covered this. He's just not into you. Take it where you can get it.]]</p>\n<p>Wade grabs a cab home; right now he's not fit for the public. Once there, he locks himself up in his room and mulls it over, which makes him think of mulled wine, which makes him think of Christmas. That, inevitably, just brings up all kinds of shitty memories revolving around his cancer diagnosis and Vanessa, and the reminder of all the reasons why this is a Bad Idea.</p>\n<p>[[Face it, you\u2019re not meant to be in a relationship with anyone. You\u2019d just fuck it up.]]</p>\n<p>[Well, certainly not anyone nice and normal...]</p>\n<p>Before, when all his baggage included was a miserable childhood full of abuse and a government sanctioned body count, Vanessa was the closest he'd ever come to healthy. Until they met, most of his relationships, if they could even be called that, were brief and casual. She was the only person he'd been able to imagine himself with past a romp in the hay. Neither of them were ever going to be anyone else's idea of normal, but together they managed to almost make a whole, functional person, filling in all the gaps.</p>\n<p>The problem was, Vanessa had fallen in love with the man he'd been, not the monster Francis made him into. By the time Wade found her again, the tiny gaps had become wide, aching holes, and no amount of wishing was going to hold them together. Wade couldn't be the man she'd known, and they both ended up resenting him for it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>But Peter never knew the old Wade.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And fuck, Wade wants to believe that could mean something.</p>\n<p>Peter is so young and sweet and innocent. He's a smart kid with a shit ton of potential, and for some reason he thinks <em>Wade</em> is worth his time? The last thing he needs is to be drawn into the shit show that is Deadpool's life, and all that entails. With superheroes and villains and shadowy government organisations and nazis. People who would leap at the chance to get back at him where it hurts the most. People who would kidnap or murder Peter in a second if they thought it would get them what they wanted from Deadpool.</p>\n<p>Sometime around the fifth time this all circles around in his head and it's clear that he's not going to shut it up on his own without putting a pistol in his mouth, Wade stumbles out to Sister Margaret's. Weasel takes one look at him and pours a double shot of tequila. Wade picks it up and gives him a little salute of thanks with the shot glass before throwing it back.</p>\n<p>It's hard to get and stay drunk with his healing factor, but Weasel's been messing around with his own, higher proof shit for just these occasions. He keeps Wade's shot glass full while he babbles the whole thing out, expression growing dubious when Wade waxes poetical about Peter's gorgeous face and soft mouth for probably an hour straight.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, you need to get laid,\u201d Weasel says, when Wade's finished. \u201cHow long has it been??\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're missing the point of my crisis, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasel shakes his head and pours another double shot. \u201cNah, man, I think everyone in the bar is clear on that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Wade scoffs and looks around challengingly at the room at large.</p>\n<p>Weasel raises a single brow and points a finger at the muted television behind the bar, where a news anchor is apparently reporting on a sighting of Spider-Man, Captain America, and The Winter Soldier. \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d he says, and a handful of guys in hearing range nod their heads in solemn agreement.</p>\n<p>Okay. So. Maybe Wade has previously spent other drunken hours waxing poetical about Spidey's gorgeous...<em>everything</em>. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d Wade grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you've got this horny teenager trying to climb your dick, and instead of buying an industrial-sized vat of lube and getting down to business, you're here, rambling about...I don't fucking even know what? Morals?\u201d Weasel shakes his head. \u201cSounds like the whole superhero shit has finally gone to your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade jabs a finger in his face. \u201cYou take that back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously though, Wade.\u201d Weasel folds his arms over the bar top and leans closer. \u201cTime to shit or get off the pot. If it's Spider-Man that's holding you back, you gotta fucking do something about it. Otherwise it's gonna come back and bite you in the ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasel's got his number. That's what it comes down to, past Vanessa and the turmoil of his life: Spider-Man. They've worked together for almost three years now, and it probably took all of five minutes for Wade to fall in love. He can still remember the first time he stumbled upon Spidey in person, after seeing his photos in the paper and the youtube videos of him in action.</p>\n<p>The way he arched through the air, it almost looked reckless, and other people would gasp when he'd let go of one web and soar, coming close to the ground before throwing out another web to catch himself, but oh, Wade could almost feel what Spider-Man must: the air whipping past his face, the exhilaration of knowing exactly how much he could take, how far he could push himself, and the satisfaction of executing each movement just right, with unerring precision.</p>\n<p>Running into him during that drugs bust had been complete accident, and Deadpool had been content to just watch, bounty be damned, as Spidey webbed the guns from their hands and slung himself around the tightly confined space with neat little flips, never stopping talking the entire time. It was almost like looking through a distorted mirror, of someone Wade <em>could have been</em>. Someone less damaged, sure, but the same smart mouth, using humour as another weapon in his arsenal.</p>\n<p>A river of red ran from the nose a guy Spidey had punched, and he flung a handful of powder in the face of another, then made a pun about blowing their noses, and Wade just fell, hard. Both figuratively and literally. On his ass, still cackling over Spidey's jokes. For a second Spider-Man had paused, uncertain, like he didn't know if Deadpool was another threat or not. Then one of the drug dealers attacked Deadpool, and that answered his question.</p>\n<p>They'd fought side by side, and after, when the sirens were drawing close, Spider-Man had graciously accepted Deadpool\u2019s invitation to tacos. It probably had something to do with the fact that he'd inhaled some of the stuff himself, during the fight, but Deadpool wasn't about to look a gift horse in the powdered nose.</p>\n<p>It might have been the drugs that had got Spidey to accept food in the first place, but by the end of that first night, the two of them lying on a rooftop too stuffed with food to sit upright, watching as the first streaks of sunlight licked across the horizon, he was back to himself.</p>\n<p>Spidey rolled over onto his stomach and stared at Deadpool for a long time. Back then his expressions in the mask had been inscrutable. \u201cThanks. For the help at the warehouse. And you know. Making sure I ate and drank a million glasses of water and\u2014I've never taken any drugs before, and if you hadn't been there, I might have gotten myself into trouble. So. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, any time,\u201d Deadpool said. \u201cWanna team up, or go for tacos, or cocaine, I'm your guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man laughed once, and then seemed to sober. \u201cThe Avengers warned me about you,\u201d he said. Deadpool was quiet, because of course they had. \u201cBut there's a lot of reasons I haven't joined them, even when Iron Man's offered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Deadpool was cautiously hopeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't agree with everything they say and do,\u201d Spider-Man said, \u201cAnd more importantly, they don't get a say in how I do my job, or who I work with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Outside a handful of the X-Men, there weren't a lot of superheroes who'd work with him, and even those that did merely suffered his presence. With the exception of Negasonic, the others treated him like a burden or a ticking time bomb about to go off, or in Cable's case, a tool, and an expendable one, at that.</p>\n<p>But he and Spidey started working together on the regular, accidentally or planned, and instead of snapping at him to shut his mouth, Spidey met him joke for joke. Instead of taking for granted that Deadpool would act as a human shield, Spidey went out of his way to make sure Deadpool came out unscathed, even after Deadpool illustrated his healing abilities. Instead of telling Deadpool to get lost the minute the mission was over, Spidey went out for celebratory Mexican and gelato, talking a mile a minute and matching Deadpool's enthusiasm every step of the way.</p>\n<p>Weasel is right. Which Wade already knew, but there's no avoiding it now. He wishes he'd had his epiphany maybe after he got Peter in his bed, because it seems like a shame to never see him naked and now that's never going to happen.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI think Spidey's morals are catching, and they fucking <em>suck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Weasel nods in commiseration. \u201cYou can keep your superhero cooties to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>They're meeting at Medina's, finally, after Peter's Monday afternoon classes. Part of Wade is tempted to just do it over text message and get it over with. Well, Yellow keeps urging him to do so, and White has all kinds of suggestions for how to get out of it, most of them involving Wade dying horribly over and over. Wade ignores them both because Peter is cool, and maybe not his soul mate like Spidey, but in his life having another friend can't hurt. If Peter will even have anything to do with him after.</p>\n<p>Peter greets him with a kiss to the cheek and a blinding smile that makes Wade feel like a class A jerkoff. \u201cThings got kind of crazy with the--\u201d Peter pauses, looking around the crowded sidewalk, and finishes, \u201cthe, uh, gang this weekend. I was going to call to see if you wanted to join, but my phone became intimately acquainted with New York's sewer system.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade has to wonder just what they were up to for that to happen, but okay, he\u2019s been known to get fall-down drunk and end up in the gutter before, and they <i>are</i> college students, so who is he to judge? Isn\u2019t that what college is all about? \u201cThat's shitty,\u201d Wade says, and they both manage to keep a straight face for a couple of seconds before bursting into laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, I don't know if you tried to text or whatever, but it'll be a day or two before I get a new one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Wade's really glad he didn't do a text message breakup. Peter wouldn't have gotten the message for days, and he would have shown up here and not known what had happened to Wade. Of course, now he's faced with the problem of seeing Peter again, and being reminded how <i>pretty</i> he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Wade catches him by the arm before they can go inside and Peter starts being funny and adorkable, and Wade forgets why he needs to say this in the first place. \u201cLook, I\u2014I don't know why you're into me, but I know I'm one lucky son of a bitch.\u201d </p>\n<p>Peter frowns and opens his mouth, no doubt to protest, but Wade holds up a hand and plows on. \u201cBut...\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade stops and shakes his head against Yellow and White pushing for attention with all the ways he could sugarcoat this, about how dangerous Wade's life is, or that Peter's too young. He's not a fucking coward. \u201cThe thing is, there's someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter's entire face changes, a flash of disbelief and honest confusion, followed by a look that Wade is personally intimate with. That look that says he's familiar with rejection, that he never should have believed he could have something he wanted in the first place. It's entirely out of place on a face like Peter's. \u201cOh,\u201d is all he says, quietly resigned.</p>\n<p>Then he laughs and takes a step back, and when he meets Wade's gaze, there are unshed tears lining his eyes. \u201cOf course, I just thought--\u201d He makes a gesture with his hand between the two of them to encompass what, Wade can't even begin to say. \u201cBut I mean, of course you have this whole other life, and I mean. It was silly of me to think...\u201d his babbling trails off and he just stands there, clearly at a loss. His teeth bite into his bottom lip hard enough to turn the skin around it white.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo look, Peter, you're fucking awesome. I mean, Jesus, have you looked in the mirror lately? And then there's--\u201d Wade sweeps a hand down the front of himself in illustration of his physical appearance, which really defies description, no matter how often and creatively Weasel tries. \u201cI wish I could just turn it off, but he's really special to me, and even if he isn't into me, it still feels unfair to both of you to just keep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles, a shaky thing that looks like it might break at any moment. Another expression Wade knows all too well from personal experience. \u201cYou know, fuck what anyone else says about you, Deadpool, you're a good guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>And aw, fuck, way to make him feel even worse about it, Peter taking this so graciously. \u201cGood enough that you still wanna hang out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives him this look, like the answer is so obviously yes, Wade is almost taken aback. \u201cDuh, you dick,\u201d he says. \u201cJust. Uh, I don't know, give me a few days, maybe?\u201d He turns away, takes a couple steps, and then turns back, hesitates. \u201cI hope it goes well. With the other guy. You <i>do</i> deserve to be happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Classy.]</p>\n<p>[[Yeah, now you just need to tell Spider-Man.]] White sounds scathingly dubious.</p>\n<p><i>Well fuck </i>you<i>, Buddy, I\u2019ve got a plan.</i></p>\n<p>The boxes respond with expectant silence.</p>\n<p>Okay, it\u2019s not a very detailed plan. Maybe plan is too strong of a word. Wade has an <i>idea</i>. He\u2019s always been better at just diving in and making things up on the fly. Shoot first and ask questions later.</p>\n<p>[[I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s innuendo or not, but either way, I don\u2019t think Spider-Man will appreciate it.]]</p>\n<p>[Just tell me when it\u2019s over. I don\u2019t think I can watch.]</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Wade mutters. His idea is perfect.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Really, his idea doesn't involve much deviation from the standard. Some flirting, some light groping, and then if all goes well some baring of his soul, hopefully followed by some heavy petting.</p>\n<p>[[How could you fail with such a well-thought out plan?]]</p>\n<p>Finding Spidey is never particularly hard. Either there\u2019s gunshots or explosions or ridiculously ostentatious villains to follow, or it\u2019s on the news. And on the quiet nights when he\u2019s patrolling, there are areas of the city that are just statistically more likely to attract his attention. </p>\n<p>Sure enough, Wade catches up with him in a rough neighbourhood of Brooklyn, knocking around a couple of muscled thugs. Normally, Wade would jump right in, but there\u2019s something that gives him pause. Spider-Man is moving differently than usual, getting in close. It doesn\u2019t suit his fighting style, which works best when he has distance with space to flip and twist and web away. Blocking blows he\u2019d usually dodge, flipping one of the guys over his shoulder like it\u2019s no effort at all, none of his usual banter. His body is one tense line. </p>\n<p>His fighting is as impressive to watch as it is jarring, and when he\u2019s webbed up the last guy, Wade lets out a long, low whistle. Spider-Man looks upward and crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Not exactly the warm welcome he was hoping for, but Wade shrugs it off. He slides down the outside of the fire escape and lands in the alley. \u201cHey Baby Boy,\u201d he says, and gamely ignores Spider-Man\u2019s huff of annoyance. \u201cLooks like you got some tension you need to work out. I\u2019d be happy to help with that.\u201d He rocks his hips suggestively, just in case it wasn\u2019t clear.</p>\n<p>Spidey just <i>stares</i> at him for several long seconds of silence. Long enough that Deadpool starts to grow worried. He looks around, but no, it's just them and the muscle guys, still bound and gagged. He sidles closer to Spidey, til their hips bump, and throws a companionable arm around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you just stop!\u201d Spidey snaps, dancing away out from under Wade\u2019s arm, and even with his voice mod, the pitch climbs distressingly high. Wade\u2019s surprise must show on his mask. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just--I can\u2019t--I need you to stop with the flirting, okay, right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>[Shot down in <i>flames</i>]</p>\n<p>Wade can barely hear Yellow over White\u2019s obnoxiously loud laughter. His muscles twitch with the urge to swat at the air around his head. Like <i>that</i> would shut them up. He holds up his hands to show he means no harm. \u201cIt\u2019s cool Ba--\u201d <i>I suppose calling him Baby Boy might constitute as flirting\u2026</i> \u201cSpidey,\u201d he finishes lamely. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man\u2019s shoulders droop. \u201cI know.\u201d He sounds glum, which is so out of character, Wade feels compelled to fix it somehow. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I know, let's do gelato! My treat.\u201d There\u2019s more of that unnerving staring and silence from Spidey. Wade shifts his weight from one leg to another uneasily. \u201cOr we could just patrol together, if you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I <i>want</i>?\u201d Spidey asks, in that dangerously high-pitched voice again. \u201cWhat <i>I</i> want?\u201d He flings his hands in the air. \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t care about what I want!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade is aware that his jaw is hanging open. Would be nice if the boxes could do something useful for once, like slam it shut for him, or shove his foot in it.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Did I miss a page or something?</i>\n</p>\n<p>[An entire issue, it would seem.]</p>\n<p>[[Some Spidey perspective <i>would</i> clear things up a bit\u2026]]</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Spidey says, hand to his forehead. \u201cWhen I want to patrol with you, I\u2019ll let you know. Until then, just <i>leave me alone</i>.\u201d It sounds more like he\u2019s begging than giving an order, body curved away from Wade\u2019s, hugging himself, and if a mask can look miserable, well, Spidey\u2019s does right now. It\u2019s so distressingly out of character, Wade doesn\u2019t know what to say. He wants to <i>fix</i> it, but apparently he\u2019s not allowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he agrees dully.</p>\n<p>[Well, that went over like a lead balloon.]</p>\n<p>White is unbearably smug. [[Maybe you should have made sure Spidey was into you before kicking ole Petey to the curb\u2026]]</p>\n<p>Spider-Man waits a moment longer, like he\u2019s waiting for Wade to say the right thing. Problem is, Wade has <i>no idea</i> what that could be, since he has <i>no idea</i> what\u2019s even happening right now. Then he makes a noise somewhere between disgust and exasperation, and webs up the nearest building.</p>\n<p>Did Iron Man finally get to Spidey? Convince him that Wade was bad news? It seems unlikely given that Spidey\u2019s stood up for him in the past, and besides, he\u2019s mostly won over Cap and Black Widow and Hawkeye. Mostly. </p>\n<p>\n<i>I mean, they don\u2019t shoot on sight anymore, so\u2026</i>\n</p>\n<p>[[There <i>is</i> simpler explanation.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear it,\u201d Wade grits out.</p>\n<p>[[Maybe his tolerance just finally ran out. Maybe he finally realised he was wasting his time with us. Maybe he was so disgusted--]]</p>\n<p>\u201cI said shut the fuck up!\u201d Wade shouts. He has his gun unholstered and halfway to his temple before he thinks better of it. Last thing Spidey needs right now is to hear a gunshot and have to come running to clean up a mess Wade left him. Besides, he\u2019s not going to let White get to him. He\u2019ll figure out a way to fix this. Somehow...</p>\n<p>It surprises literally no one when Wade\u2019s way of dealing with his current predicament is to kill every bad guy who crosses his path, and spending the rest of the time moping in his room listening to Matchbox Twenty. He\u2019s too depressed to jerk off, which is truly impressive, White comments dryly.</p>\n<p>Al gets tired of his shit within a couple of days and says she\u2019s going to visit a friend. Weasel kicks him out of the bar the one time Wade drags himself in, telling him he\u2019s driving off customers who are afraid he\u2019s going to skewer them on a katana. Which, fair enough.</p>\n<p>Wade is considering skipping town for a while. The boxes might call him a coward, but he\u2019s fucked up his friendship with Spidey, and on top of that, he turned down the only person who\u2019s shown any interest in him since Vanessa. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a good reason for sticking around when it\u2019s not doing anyone any good. These days he could pretty much throw an arrow at a map and find a job wherever it lands.</p>\n<p>The pros far outweigh the cons, but he\u2019s still dragging his feet, pretending he doesn\u2019t know the reason why, when there comes a tap at his window. Suddenly he\u2019s grateful for the whole \u201ctoo depressed to jerk off\u201d thing, because it\u2019s Spidey\u2019s face staring back at him through the glass. No need for another kick in the blue balls with his pants down, as they say.</p>\n<p>[No one says that.]</p>\n<p>[[Literally no one has said that ever, except you, right now.]]</p>\n<p>Wade sits up so quickly he thinks he tears something in his neck, holy fuck, thank god that\u2019s going to heal in a few seconds. He rubs at the tendon and jumps up from bed to unlatch the window and slide it open. \u201cSpidey! Hey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>Shit, shit, play it cool.</i>\n</p>\n<p>[[Yeah, the likelihood of that seems vanishingly slim.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cWade.\u201d If a mask can look weary, Spider-Man\u2019s does right now. Which is at least better than disgusted or pissed off, so Wade will take it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey, man, I\u2019m so sorry, I feel like such a dick, I mean I <i>am</i> a dick--\u201d Oh god, he\u2019s babbling. <i>Just don\u2019t turn it into innuendo, no innuendo.</i></p>\n<p>[Please don\u2019t say anything about your dick.]</p>\n<p>Spider-Man holds up his hand. \u201cWade,\u201d he repeats, more firmly. \u201cLet\u2019s just forget about it, okay? Cap and Barnes need some help at this Hydra base upstate. You in?\u201d</p>\n<p>As much as Wade is eager to jump on the invitation, the apparently self-destructive asshole part of of him can\u2019t keep its mouth shut. \u201cAre you sure the Avengers want my help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Avengers aren\u2019t going.\u201d Spidey shrugs. \u201cLingering trust issues, I guess? I don\u2019t know, the point is, we need help, and <i>I</i> trust <i>you</i>, which is good enough for them. So are you in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade might need a few minutes to get the wild pattering of his heart under control at that declaration. Like, sure, they work together, and Spidey has made his trust implicit, from the amount of times he\u2019s let Wade cover his back. But he\u2019s never <i>said</i> it. He practically trips over his own feet in his rush to get his suit.</p>\n<p>He figures he\u2019ll take his bike, or maybe hotwire a car, or hell, even call Dopinder and see if the terms of his parole allow him to leave the city, but when Wade comes out back, it\u2019s to find Spidey waiting by a sleek, nondescript black SUV. \u201cI guess we get to travel in style when we\u2019re playing with the big boys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Inside, Sam Wilson is at the wheel with Barnes at shotgun, and Cap is all serious-faced in the middle row, in a fancy seat that can spin around and face back or forward. Wade has to resist the urge to clap his hands in glee. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to have Colossus on his dick trying to get him to join Captain Picard\u2019s bunch of declawed losers. But Captain America, he\u2019s like, a fucking rebel--going against orders to save the 107th (okay, yes, he read all the old comics as a kid and maybe still has them in pristine fucking condition in plastic sleeves locked up in a safe box somewhere), dismantling Shield, then going up against the Avengers and the UN--in the end, all of it to save Barnes. Wade\u2019s never believed in anything that much, but he has to respect it.</p>\n<p>[Oh come on, we all know you\u2019d do at least that much for <i>Spider-Man</i>.]</p>\n<p>He\u2019d do a whole fucking lot worse than all of that for Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool,\u201d Cap greets, with a polite but serious nod of his head. \u201cSpider-Man has good things to say about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOMG,\u201d Wade squeals, because Captain America is addressing him directly. \u201cYou\u2019ll make me blush--thank goodness for the mask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you really take out all those dudes in the sub basement at that medical facility?\u201d Falcon asks, and when Wade nods, he whistles. \u201cRespect, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, impressive though it may be, we\u2019re not really going for a triple digit body count tonight,\u201d Cap says. \u201cThat medical facility was only one of three that we took out, but apparently there was at least one more, because our reports tell us they\u2019ve started working on a new round of super soldiers.\u201d He passes a tablet to Wade with a series of dossiers to sweep through.</p>\n<p>\u201cSix prisoners have gone \u2018missing\u2019 over the last two weeks, from all over the country, all of them convicted for violent crimes, all of them ex-military. Right now it\u2019s being covered up. Anyone with the ability to hit six different maximum security prisons simultaneously and leave not a trace behind is reason enough to justify the involvement of enhanced individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade flips through the dossiers as Cap talks. It\u2019s not just the prisoners, either. There are several suspected missing members of military and paramilitary. Go big or go home, the Hydra way of getting shit done. That\u2019s a whole fucking lot of canon fodder.</p>\n<p>Cap outlines the plan. They\u2019re going to be outnumbered like thirty to one (with the fucking King of Wakanda himself meeting them there in his <i>jet</i>), and that\u2019s not even taking into account the potential for brainwashed killing machines. Who knows how far they\u2019ve gotten along on the whole reconditioning thing. As far as the media is concerned, everything is peachy-keen with the Avengers again, but if that were the case, this is definitely the sort of situation to bring in all the guns.</p>\n<p>When Wade says as much, Cap\u2019s mouth goes tight and he can practically feel the tension radiating from the front seat. \u201cTony has the rest of the team working on another problem,\u201d Cap says, and that\u2019s the end of that. Spidey wasn\u2019t kidding about those trust issues, damn son.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Falcon, Spider-Man, and Deadpool taking the front, head-on assault, </p>\n<p>(and Yellow is still giggling about that, giving Wade some totally inappropriate mental images of them all charging in butt-ass naked--which, in Wade\u2019s case, might be considered a deadly weapon</p>\n<p>[[You can decide for yourself whether he means his dick or that much of his skin on display.]])</p>\n<p>while Black Panther takes the rear (it takes all Wade\u2019s not considerable self-control not to remark on that), and Cap and Barnes sneak inside. Barnes obviously has a lot more experience in this fucked up Manchurian Candidate bullshit than the rest of them, and it\u2019s their hope that whatever has been done can be reversed--like it was with him. Deadpool is willing to smile and nod for now, but he\u2019s not opposed to taking them out if they prove too dangerous, and he has a feeling that no matter what the others say about leaving the safety on, they know it.</p>\n<p>Turns out Falcon\u2019s a pretty good addition to Spidey and Deadpool\u2019s fighting style. He doesn\u2019t have Natasha\u2019s style or ruthless efficiency, but the flying thing is so goddamn cool. Of course it\u2019s not as fun when he can\u2019t just cut through these fuckers. Wade consoles himself with the looping mantra of <i>Captain America let us on his team!</i> and even White can\u2019t think of a single thing to say to shit on his parade right now.</p>\n<p>The Hydra security have no compunction about shooting <i>them</i>. Within seconds an alarm is blaring, painting the night in shades of yellow and red, and they\u2019re facing the full defensive force of the base. Falcon and Spidey are good at dodging, with Falcon picking them off one by one and neutralising them, and Spidey webbing guns out of hands and pinning them to the spot. But for every one they take out, it\u2019s like two more come spilling out from the door, guns blazing.</p>\n<p>[[I see what you did there, and it wasn\u2019t funny.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking hilarious,\u201d Deadpool mutters, and charges in, because there\u2019s nothing more unnerving or demoralising for the enemy than the guy that just <i>doesn\u2019t go down</i> no matter how many clips you empty in them. The nearest guy\u2019s gun clicks harmlessly when he pulls the trigger, and his eyes widen almost comically.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is with you assholes never paying attention to your clip size?\u201d Deadpool asks, as he grabs the barrel and shoves the butt back against the guy\u2019s head. \u201cYou think this is a fucking Hollywood production? Unlimited ammo?\u201d He jerks the gun and twists it out of the guy\u2019s grip to use like a club. A single blow knocks him unconscious. \u201cFucking amateur.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next guy\u2019s just holding down his finger on the trigger, apparently either unaware or unconcerned by the fact that recoil is sending that shit all over the place. \u201cHey! Spray and Pray!\u201d Deadpool vaults himself over the low vehicle gate and breaks into a run. \u201cDo they even <i>train</i> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hydra\u2019s tried to hire Deadpool in the past, and now he almost feels bad turning them down, because it\u2019s clear they need someone who knows what the fuck they\u2019re doing around here. Almost. Except for the whole Nazi thing. The second guy goes down as easily as the first. He tries to back up and trips over his own feet, firing into the air. Deadpool dodges under the fire of another errant assault rifle and grabs him by the hair, slamming his head against the concrete. They said no killing, but they didn\u2019t say anything about permanent brain damage.</p>\n<p>[Hey, if it\u2019s good enough for Batman\u2026]]</p>\n<p>The whole fight is sort of pathetic. Even with wave after wave of soldiers pouring out the door like some sort of shitty survival video game, Deadpool only has a half-dozen healing bullet wounds, all in fairly innocuous places. They drive the line back to the entrance within the first ten minutes, leaving a trail of unconscious or webbed dickheads behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Deadpool shouts. \u201cIt\u2019s no fun when you don\u2019t make it a challenge.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGoddamnit, Deadpool, what have I told you about tempting fate like that?!\u201d Spidey shouts back.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, when they fling open the door onto a weird receptionist area, Deadpool recognises the faces of the three people waiting to meet them, from Cap\u2019s dossiers. The grizzled ex-marine with a face like it was carved out of stone, the six foot five convict with a trail of tear tattoos down his cheek and missing incisor, and the paramilitary lady with the buzz cut. They move quickly--no guns, but Deadpool quickly learns they don\u2019t really need them, when the marine lands a punch to his nose. A lesser man might have dropped dead on the spot from the force of it. As it is, blood gushes freely down his face and through the mask.</p>\n<p>[[Now this is more like it!]]</p>\n<p>Deadpool licks the taste of blood from his lips and drops his centre of gravity as the soldier rains down blows on him. He manages to get a single punch in before the soldier physically lifts him up by the straps on his suit. The world turns sideways and Deadpool lands on his back on the reception desk, followed closely by the soldier.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuy a guy a drink, first!\u201d Deadpool protests, and brings his arms up just in time to keep his newly healed nose from being broken all over again.</p>\n<p>Beside him, the ex-con is slamming Spidey\u2019s face into the computer screen. \u201cHave you tried just turning it off and back on again, first?\u201d Spider-Man bites out. He arches his back and throws the guy off.</p>\n<p>Falcon manages to distract the soldier on Deadpool for a second with an arm around his neck, and earns an elbow to the face and a kick to the gut, sending him flying. It\u2019s enough of a distraction for Wade to get the upperhand, though. He plants both feet on the soldier\u2019s chest and shoves with enough force that he stumbles and lands on his back. </p>\n<p>Grizzly\u2019s on his feet again the same time as Deadpool, and it\u2019s been years since Deadpool\u2019s really engaged in hand to hand combat. Pretty much around the time he underwent his \u201ctransformation\u201d and stopped giving a fuck about whether the people he was after were still breathing when he was finished with them. Bullets and katanas are far more efficient.</p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s muscle memory from his time in the Special Forces. Deadpool manages to dodge and get the soldier by the wrist, twists and forces his hand back. Without missing a beat the soldier does a fucking backflip and uses the momentum to pull Deadpool off balance and knock him to the ground. He sweeps out a leg and brings the soldier down with him.</p>\n<p>Around them, Deadpool is vaguely aware of the others fighting. Falcon\u2019s wings and Spidey\u2019s webs aren\u2019t a whole lot of good with the low ceilings and narrow confines of the hall. He catches a glimpse of Falcon pinned to the desk by Buzz-Cut and flailing around for something to use as a weapon. He hits his super soldier across the face with a stapler and Spidey says, \u201cYou really stuck it to her.\u201d </p>\n<p>Falcon makes a disgusted noise, and Deadpool laughs out loud before his soldier hops to his feet and kicks him solidly in the gut. Spidey webs the guy in the back and yanks him across the room, then shoots out another web to his feet. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not slowing down even a little bit,\u201d Falcon comments under his breath, regrouping at Deadpool\u2019s side and offering him a hand up.</p>\n<p>Deadpool reaches back to rub his hand along the hilt of one katana. \u201cI have a few ideas about what we could do to remedy that,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo--\u201d Spidey cuts off as he rolls out of the way of a blow, \u201ckilling!\u201d </p>\n<p>For a minute Wade is distracted watching him, because his chance at ever tapping that might be shot to hell, but damn is he nice to watch in action. The fluid curve of his body as he rises to his feet and flips forward, shooting off webbing at the ceiling as he goes. He pulls his legs upward, forming a V with his body and vaults over Missing-Incisor (he really needs to come up with a better monkier for this one) to land behind him, then webs him face first against the wall.</p>\n<p>The remaining two share a look like they\u2019re communicating without words, and then both turn to Spider-Man. Apparently, they\u2019ve decided he\u2019s the real threat here, which, fair enough.</p>\n<p>[[Only because we\u2019ve been neutered.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about some light dismemberment?\u201d Deadpool asks. \u201cWe could even fix \u2018em up with metal limbs, and name \u2018em after different seasons, collect a full set.\u201d Falcon snorts in amusement.</p>\n<p>From somewhere deep in the facility there\u2019s an explosion that rocks the whole building. The floor under them rumbles ominously. Deadpool and Spidey might not have the whole super-soldier mind-whammy telepathy, but they\u2019ve fought together often enough that they\u2019re a pretty well-oiled machine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to oil his machinery,\u201d Deadpool says, and can imagine Spidey\u2019s eyeroll. They move together to take advantage of the momentary disorientation, Deadpool kicking Buzz-Cut in the side of her knee and sending her to floor, and Spidey webbing her lower legs in place there, stuck kneeling, while Deadpool punches her between jaw and ear, and she slumps over, unconscious.</p>\n<p>Now Grizzly\u2019s reassessing his odds, and turns to run down the far corridor. \u201cHey, Autumn Soldier, we weren\u2019t finished dancing!\u201d Deadpool yells after him. He dives after him, arms around his lower legs, tackling him to the ground. They wrestle for a minute before Grizzly comes up on top. He gets in a few good blows and fucking <i>breaks the nose again</i> before Falcon knocks him over the head with enough force to stun him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I miss the part of the plan with the explosion?\u201d Deadpool asks.</p>\n<p>[I think we would have remembered that.]</p>\n<p>[[I\u2019m a little insulted they didn\u2019t ask <i>us</i>.]]</p>\n<p>Falcon shrugs. \u201cProbably Barnes, destroying the lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan after my own heart!\u201d Deadpool exclaims. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe should get these three back to the jet,\u201d Falcon says. He hauls up Grizzly and Spidey grabs both of the other two, one over each shoulder. Deadpool\u2019s mouth goes dry and his mind fills up with all kind of filthy images of the way Spidey could use that strength.</p>\n<p>They come around the side of the building to find Cap, Barnes, and His Royal Highness fighting their way through a crowd of at least two dozen Hydra security officer. Barnes and Rogers cut through them with a ruthless efficiency that is, frankly, really fucking hot. The way Cap throws his shield and Barnes catches it, lays out one of the security guys, and throws it back, ricocheting off another on the way, before it lands neatly back in Cap\u2019s grip. And it occurs to Deadpool then, watching the bodies drop dead, that maybe they meant no killing with the super soldiers, but everyone else was fair game.</p>\n<p>Fuck yes.</p>\n<p>Through the open hatch of the jet, Deadpool can see two rows of weird, glowing white pods fixed to the hull, filled with the super soldiers, so they\u2019re safe. He unsheathes his katana and leads the way through the crowd, clearing the path for Falcon and Spider-Man. He skewers one guy and kicks another in the ballsack, then runs him through when he falls to his knees.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool!\u201d Spidey calls, half despairingly, half scolding, but Deadpool\u2019s not having any of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh huh, Spidey, Captain America just about decapitated that dude with his <i>shield</i>, so you can\u2019t say shit!\u201d And to punctuate his point, he goes ahead and <i>actually</i> decapitates the asshole rushing at them with guns blazing, and takes a moment to appreciate the comical expression on the guy\u2019s face as it goes sailing away.</p>\n<p>Spidey gives a long-suffering sigh, but at least he doesn\u2019t try to argue the point. And, well, maybe that leaves Deadpool feeling magnanimous, because he doesn\u2019t even <i>kill</i> the next two that cross his path, just leaves them minus a couple of parts. They can live without \u2018em.</p>\n<p>Falcon and Spidey get the last of the soldiers loaded up while the rest of them take care of the stragglers, and okay. Look, Deadpool has never given two shits about what Tony Stark and the rest of those holier than thou douchebags think of him, but this is something else. All these superheroes actually fighting alongside him, trusting Deadpool to have their backs.</p>\n<p>[[Yeah, real fucking touching. You know the only reason they\u2019re putting up with you is Spider-Man.]]</p>\n<p>[It\u2019s not like they\u2019d hang out with us otherwise.]</p>\n<p>Deadpool aggressively ignores them \u2018cause, nope! Still not going to let them bring him down right now! Spidey and Falcon rejoin the fight, and then it\u2019s over in minutes. T\u2019Challa, Barnes, and Cap have a whispered conversation, and then the jet is off again with it\u2019s new precious cargo.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna go with him and do the whole\u2026\u201d Deadpool gestures to his head to indicate a mind-whammy or who the fuck knows.</p>\n<p>\u201cT\u2019Challa knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Barnes mutters. \u201cHis scientists fixed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be heading over soon enough,\u201d Cap says. \u201cThere are things here that still needs handled. We have to make sure that fourth medical facility was the last of them, or what we did tonight won\u2019t matter--they\u2019ll just keep churning out more and more soldiers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut now we go for celebratory tacos, amiright?\u201d Wade asks hopefully.</p>\n<p>[[Oh my god, you\u2019re so pathetic. Spidey barely tolerates you, what makes you think--]]</p>\n<p>\u201cI could kill a plate of nachos right now,\u201d Sam says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know this place outside Yonkers that has chalupas to die for,\u201d Wade offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know what those are,\u201d Steve says.</p>\n<p>Sam gives him a sidelong look. \u201cMan, you are like a walking, talking caricature of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man,\u201d Wade gushes, \u201cCaptain, you gotta try \u2018em--and not that shit from Taco Die-Shitting-on-Toilet Bell. I mean the real deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap gives him an amused look, one eyebrow arched indulgently. \u201cYou can call me Steve, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barnes throws an arm around Cap\u2019s shoulders and starts leading him back toward the car. \u201cCome on, old man, let\u2019s go feed you and get you tucked into bed before you turn into a pumpkin.\u201d </p>\n<p>Cap sputters indignantly. \u201c<i>Me</i> an old man?\u201d The two of them and Sam leave Wade standing there, jaw dropped in disbelief. </p>\n<p>Spidey comes up to stand beside him and nudges him companionably in the side. \u201cYou good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said--they said--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, you doofus, I\u2019m starving.\u201d Spidey gives Wade a little shove towards the rest of them. </p>\n<p>\u201cHa!\u201d Wade says to the boxes. \u201cTake that, dickweeds.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wade has to jog to catch up with Spidey, still trailing behind the others. \u201cSo...we\u2019re good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey nudges him again, this time shoulder to shoulder. \u201cI just needed a little time, Wade,\u201d he says softly, and then, \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter texts him a few days later, and Wade is honestly afraid to open the message for the better part of two days, just looking at the notification every time he uses his phone. He knows he\u2019s lucky Al hasn\u2019t gotten back yet, because she\u2019d have already stolen his phone and professed undying love for Peter. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s just...now that Spidey has made it clear he\u2019s not interested, Wade feels like a total dick for turning Peter down, but it\u2019s not like he can walk that back. Peter doesn\u2019t seem like the sort happy to be someone\u2019s second choice, and he deserves better than that. He deserves better than Wade, without a doubt. Because even though Spidey\u2019s turned him down, it hasn\u2019t stopped how Wade feels.</p>\n<p>Then he considers the sort of d-bag that actually leaves a friend hanging on a text for two days and almost shoots himself in the face. Turns out Peter was inviting him to play games, and Deadpool only feels a little shitty for making up a lie about being out of town on a job, and shows up at Peter\u2019s place with a shit ton of junk food, booze, and a pile of new games to make up for it.</p>\n<p>Peter takes in the bounty bemusedly, idly turning the bottle of beer Wade hands him, and says, \u201cI\u2019m not old enough to drink, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, really?\u201d Wade hasn\u2019t thought about it much. Like, college-aged, sure, but he\u2019s working at Stark Industries already. \u201cWell, here\u2019s to contributing to the delinquency of minors.\u201d He clinks his bottle against Peter\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this isn\u2019t going to do anything for me, but--\u201d Peter shrugs and takes a swig. \u201cWhy not?\u201d He makes a considering face, and Wade waits for his approval. He\u2019d picked this one because of all the spices, remembering how Peter likes his coffee. Then Peter smiles and takes another, longer drink. \u201cIt\u2019s good. But Wade.\u201d He laughs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to bring all this stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade waves him off. \u201cEh, I\u2019ve got the money, why not?\u201d He takes the rest of the six-pack to the fridge and his eye catches on the invitation stuck to the front with an Invader Zim magnet. \u201cHey, you going to Stark\u2019s party?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks momentarily confused before his gaze lands on the invitation as well. \u201cOh. That thing. Do you know when I first started working with him, Mister Stark invited me to this NBA finals party at Stark Tower, and then he didn\u2019t even show up? He was <i>at the game</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a douche,\u201d Wade says. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt was still a pretty sick spread,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut I mean, I went to his Halloween thing a couple years ago and it was just weird. I felt out of place with all the Avengers and Shield agents and random socialites.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, dude,\u201d Wade throws himself over the back of the sofa and lands heavily next to Peter, jostling beer down his hand. \u201cWe should totally crash it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter spares his a sarcastic smirk. \u201cIt\u2019s not crashing if I have an invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have an invitation,\u201d Wade points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you saying you wanna be my plus one?\u201d Wade leans against his side and bats his lashes at Peter, which, actually, must be a pretty horrifying sight, but Peter just smiles fondly and sighs. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not exactly as if I have a busy social calendar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade pumps his fist. \u201cYes, this is great. Stark\u2019s gonna shit bricks when he sees you showing up with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cWhat are you going as?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly my <i>favourite</i> superhero ever,\u201d Wade exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cI...have no idea, seriously, that could be one of a dozen, honestly\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll just have to wait and see. What about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know--maybe since you\u2019re going as someone else, I\u2019ll be Deadpool,\u201d Peter says breezily, and Wade has to remind himself that he\u2019s already had and lost his chance at that ass when his brain supplies the image of Peter wearing his suit, red and black leather hugging all those sweet little curves.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, please don\u2019t say you\u2019re joking,\u201d Wade whispers.</p>\n<p>[[Please, he couldn\u2019t fit in our pants.]]</p>\n<p>[Oh, but he\u2019s welcome to try.]</p>\n<p>Peter laughs, but it sounds a little off. \u201cGuess <i>you\u2019ll</i> just have to wait and see,\u201d he shoots back.</p>\n<p>[[You need to watch your fucking mouth.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Peter--\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter holds up his hand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t apologise again,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, okay. I get it. It\u2019s how you are. And I--\u201d He grabs the two controllers from the coffee table and shoves one at Wade. \u201cI like how you are, okay? So can we just shoot some shit up now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade swallows back all the stupid, useless, inadequate things he might say, and nods his head. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of shooting some shit up.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>With the Avengers moved upstate and Stark Tower sold, the party is being held at the much more intimate penthouse Stark purchased shortly thereafter. It\u2019s just another ostentatious display of wealth, sitting empty 90% of the time and only getting use when he breezes through New York City. Wade stands in front of the tower of glittering glass and steel, and mutters, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone laughs behind him. \u201cWait until you see the regulation tennis court on the roof.\u201d Wade turns to see Barnes lingering in the shadow by the side of the building, dressed in a pretty badass Solid Snake costume.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing over there? Have you seen Peter? Parker?\u201d Wade adds at the end, and then feels like an utter moron because how would Barnes know who the hell Peter is, last name or no?</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably upstairs already, playing nice with Stark.\u201d Barnes rolls his eyes. \u201cAnyway unless you wanna deal with all the reporters and bullshit, you should take the back way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Wade glances over his shoulder at the main entrance where there are flashing lights and more super powered people than he\u2019s ever seen before in one place lined up to enter, like it\u2019s the fucking Oscars. \u201cProbably for the best. I don\u2019t know if the cameras can handle all of this.\u201d He sweeps his hands down the front of himself, and Barnes snorts. \u201cAnd, you know, I wasn\u2019t strictly invited. In the strictest sense of the word.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStrictly speaking.\u201d Barnes shakes his head. \u201cCome on, dumbass.\u201d Coming from him, it almost sounds like a term of endearment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem suspiciously familiar with this place,\u201d Wade comments, when Barnes leads them through a staff entrance.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting that I\u2019ve broken into Tony Stark\u2019s penthouse on numerous occasions in his absence, to be fed by his chef and swim in his ridiculous pooI, I know nothing about it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a <i>pool</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, as I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d Barnes presses the button for the elevator and then leans against the wall beside the mirrored doors and takes Wade in head to toe. \u201cNice costume, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade considers his reflection in the elevator doors, the truly alarming shade of yellow that makes up the majority of it and the more subdued blue of the highlights, topped with his own mask, of course. \u201cYeah.\u201d Wade offers him a fist to bump and Barnes gives him a dubious look, but ultimately gives it up and taps his fist to Wade\u2019s. \u201cI knew you were my kinda dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just can\u2019t wait to see Logan\u2019s face when he sees you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s mouth drops open. \u201cWhat the shit? He\u2019s here?\u201d He might start bouncing out of excitement any second. \u201cHe <i>never</i> does costume parties. Or any parties. Or gatherings of people for festive purposes!\u201d Wade really thinks about it for a second, mouth pulled into a cringe. \u201cOr, really, any purposes, aside from getting shit-faced and watching cage fights.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barnes shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Stark has this way of getting people to do whatever the hell he wants.\u201d He tips his head to the side and indicates himself in illustration. \u201cWhat are you doing here anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Wade <i>does</i> bounce on his toes. \u201cGonna get Petey to help me prank Iron Toaster,\u201d he says gleefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodie two-shoes?\u201d Barnes arches a brow. \u201cYeah, good luck with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s about to ask how Barnes knows Peter, when the elevator dings and opens up in a bustling kitchen. The staff greet Barnes like an old friend and suddenly the two of them are surrounded by platters of fresh hors d'oeuvres and champagne.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that nice friend of yours?\u201d one of the women asks Barnes. </p>\n<p>Wade already has all sorts of ideas about what the Cap and Bucky are getting up to behind closed doors, and the way Barnes blushes and he ducks his head pretty much confirms all of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Steve\u2019s out making nice for the paparazzi,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>The woman wraps up a stack of lumpy orange biscuit-looking things and passes them over to Barnes like a secret. \u201cI made some of those carrot cookies you two like so much. Make sure he gets a few!\u201d She pinches his cheek in parting.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d Barnes says sidelong to Wade, once they\u2019ve left the kitchen, still pink about the cheeks.</p>\n<p>Wade mimes zipping his lips and Barnes eyes him suspiciously. Like, he\u2019s got to know that Wade basically has no filter whatsoever, right? He can\u2019t honestly expect Wade to keep a promise like that, can he?</p>\n<p>There are several smaller rooms splitting off, staff quarters and storage, and Barnes points out all the little secret features of the place as they go, most importantly the one that leads to Stark\u2019s \u2018wine cellar.\u2019 Then the hallway opens up into a gigantic, open space full of what looks to be roughly \u2153 of the population of the city.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man, Steve made it up. I gotta go rescue him from Senator Garner.\u201d Barnes heads off into the crowd, tossing over his shoulder, \u201cHave fun screwing shit up.\u201d </p>\n<p>Where to even <i>start</i>? There\u2019s Doctor Strange dressed up as Sherlock Holmes, talk about some serious fourth wall breakage, and he\u2019s gesturing with his hands animatedly talking to a bored looking Jessica Jones dressed like Jessica Jones carrying a mostly empty fifth of bourbon. Wade has never been more envious of a pair of skinny jeans in his life.</p>\n<p>Natasha has set up shop at the bar in her Resident Evil Alice costume (to match Clint\u2019s Leon, presumably), complete with an assortment of fully functional weaponry, along with Sue Storm as Claire, Maria Hill as Jill Valentine, and Storm as Ada Wong. Frankly, Wade can\u2019t decide which of the five of them is hotter, but Storm is rocking the <i>shit</i> out of the slit on her dress. <i>Legs for daaaaaaays.</i></p>\n<p>[Holy shit, is that that Captain Marvel dressed up as Xena Warrior Princess???]</p>\n<p>Tonight is going to fuel his spank bank for <i>years</i>.</p>\n<p>Wade makes his way to the bar and Natasha greets him with a frothy pink concoction and a wink. Wade takes a sip, pineapple, cranberry, and a <i>lot</i> of vodka. \u201cThat would knock a lesser man off his feet,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should see Thor if you want something that might have an actual effect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if Tony or Logan is going to be more annoyed to see you,\u201d Storm murmurs, \u201cbut either way I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be an entertaining show.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Wade protests, \u201cI\u2019m here legitimately. Peter invited me.\u201d Clint and Natasha share an unreadable look that makes Wade suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re looking for him, I\u2019d suggest the lounge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sure enough, there\u2019s Peter standing with Pepper Potts, looking earnest and attentive, and like he\u2019d do anything to get out of whatever conversation he\u2019s a part of.</p>\n<p>[We should swoop in all superhero and rescue him!]</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s costume, a Vault 101 jumpsuit, looks homemade instead of store-bought, and pretty well-done, too. It\u2019s not particularly sexy or revealing, but all the same, Wade can\u2019t stop grinning at the choice. Complete with a pip-boy and leather armour pads. What a nerd. And they even <i>match</i>, how perfect is that, and they weren\u2019t even trying!</p>\n<p>Wade practically skips over, and Pepper stops mid-sentence to stare at him in disbelief when he says, \u201cHey there, sexy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter bursts into laughter at the sight of him, hand over his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI--\u201d Pepper looks at Peter and back at Wade, like she\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019s addressing her or Peter. Her expression wars between confused and concerned. \u201cPeter,\u201d she says, and clears her throat, \u201cThis is Wade Wilson. Mister Wilson--\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter waves a hand, still giggling. \u201cHe knows who I am.\u201d Pepper\u2019s face finally settles on concern, eyebrows pinched, but Peter pays her no mind. \u201cOh my god, you look--is that actual <i>hair</i> you glued to your mask?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWolverine fur.\u201d Wade grins, showing off all his teeth, and Peter breaks down, bent over in half.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Miss Potts,\u201d Peter says, straightening and trying to wrangle his laughter to no avail. He wipes at the corner of his eyes. \u201cWade is my plus one tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper\u2019s lips press in a thin line. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware--does Tony know about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Just then, there\u2019s a crash from the floor below, and over the balcony Wade catches sight of Johnny Storm and Scott Lang, both dressed as Han Solo, engaging in an impromptu game of beer pong. \u201cOh my--\u201d Pepper runs off in that direction, thank <i>fuck</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Peter says, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cEveryone acts like I\u2019m still a teenager around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Wade asks.</p>\n<p>Peter flushes bright red. \u201cOnly for another couple months. That\u2019s not the point. I\u2019m not their kid brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy tiger.\u201d Wade holds up his hands. \u201cI promise I don\u2019t think of you as a kid brother. And hey, at least they invited you.\u201d At that, Peter looks contrite, and Wade has no interest in his pity. \u201cHey, help me find Thor. Black Widow says he\u2019s got the good shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes and lets Wade drag him off through the crowd. They find Thor along with Banner, and Steve and his crew tucked away in a game room off to the slide, playing pool. Sam is telling a story, dressed up like Geordi LeForge with the eyeband and everything. \u201cAnd then I wake up in Jersey without my shoes, and Barnes doesn\u2019t have his arm, and all I can think is, \u2018where are the bees?\u2019 And then this asshole,\u201d here he jerks his thumb at Barnes, \u201cjust goes, \u2018I think I dropped the tracker in the sewer.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd dissolves into laughter, except Thor, who is literally on the edge of his seat. \u201cAnd what became of the bees?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam waves a dismissive hand. \u201cHope and Scott had already taken care of it by then. The real adventure was finding his arm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Thor booms. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve brought a friend!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Wade--Deadpool--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes!\u201d Thor claps a hand on Wade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI have heard tell of your deeds. The tale of your triumph over the zombie dinosaur in the Savage Land is a favourite in New Asgard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, seriously?\u201d Wade asks. \u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor frowns and glances questioningly at Peter, who waves a hand. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean literally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Thor says. \u201cHeimdall watches over all the realms, and regales us with the rousing battles he witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight on.\u201d Wade offers his fist and Thor cheerfully hits it with his own, hard enough to break a couple bones. Wade grits his teeth around a smile while he shakes it out. </p>\n<p>Beside him, it sounds suspiciously like Peter is trying to muffle his laughter with his hand. \u201cHey, Thor, you have any of that Asgardian Ale?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly!\u201d Thor pulls out a flask and pours a tipple in Wade\u2019s drink, then turns to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Steve interjects.</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Thor gives them a blinding smile. \u201cAesir are weaned from our mother\u2019s milk on this ale!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Banner says under his breath, and the others just stare wide-eyed. Wade very diplomatically doesn\u2019t make any comments about backwards, medieval practices.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Peter says. \u201cNot really looking to get trashed tonight anyway. I\u2019ve got an exam Monday and the last thing I need is to spend all day tomorrow nursing a super-hangover.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talk of exams apparently gets Banner all hot and bothered, because suddenly he\u2019s all up on Peter, and the two of them are geeking out over science. Wade gets drawn into the conversation with the others, and, prompted by Thor and Sam, even tells a few of his own stories. It\u2019s definitely weird to have a hero other than Spidey listening to him without responding in utter disgust. (Logan and Cable don\u2019t count, because Wade has a sneaking suspicion they tune out about 98% of what he says. Domino is actually a pretty good listener, but he always assumes she's just humouring him.)</p>\n<p>Then Vision and Scarlet Witch show up, and Wade does his best to disappear into the wall himself, before Vision notices him and runs to tattle to Stark. If Potts hasn\u2019t already done so. Wade grabs Peter by the wrist and drags him out of the room. Thor\u2019s ale has gotten him buzzed, and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll last long. Might as well take advantage of the feeling while he has it, and carry out his plans.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, come on, Barnes showed me this, you gotta see it.\u201d He takes them back towards the little hallway that leads to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheck this, Stark has a fucking hidden stairway for the staff. Like this is antebellum Georgia or some shit.\u201d Wade pushes on the wood panelling in the hall which opens to reveal the staircase.</p>\n<p>The upper floor is mostly just one giant room, separated by furniture into a bedroom, sitting room, and study area. Through the floor to ceiling windows, just outside bedroom area is a pool that looks like it just drops off the side of the building.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s awesome,\u201d Peter says, and pushes open the sliding door. He crouches down to flick his fingers in the little waterfall at one end. \u201cI should totally swing by sometime when it\u2019s not fricking freezing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something about his word choice is strange, suggesting a familiarity with Stark beyond employee/employer, and <i>that</i> threatens Wade\u2019s good mood. He fishes around in the pockets he specially sewed into his Wolverine costume, until he finds what he's looking for, packed just for tonight. A bunch of unexploded dye packs from a bag of ransom money on a recent job. They way he sees it, he got the guy back relatively unharmed, the ransom money is like a bonus on his pay.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Peter asks, coming up behind Wade at Stark's dresser.</p>\n<p>Wade holds up one of the packs for him to see, grinning and wiggling his brows. \u201cGonna tuck 'em in his underwear drawer, may be a couple of his suit pockets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter covers his face with his hand. \u201cOh my god, you are like a twelve year old. Why do you want to make him hate you even more?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna help?\u201d Wade tosses one and damn, Peter has some quick reflexes and a delicate touch. He manages to snag it out of midair without setting it off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can't! If Mister Stark found out--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Wade interrupts, \u201cbecause he's your boss. Nah, I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks indignant. \u201cHe's not my <i>boss</i>,\u201d he says haughtily, throwing the pack back at Wade, who does manage to catch it, but it still goes off in his face. Peter smirks. \u201cI'm not an Avenger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wade scoffs. He grabs the nearest article of clothing from the drawer--a Pink Floyd t-shirt, <i>nice</i>, he\u2019s keeping this--to wipe the purple ink off his mask, sputtering at the taste on his lips. \u201cI doubt anyone is going to mistake you for one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?\u201d Peter demands. There's a smile toying around his lips, but he looks ready to be offended if he decides that's the proper course of action.</p>\n<p>\n<i>God, he's fucking adorable.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't worry, Petey, you have plenty of amazing, non-traditional superhero qualities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well I can non-traditionally kick your ass,\u201d Peter says. He crowds close, and Wade can't help but giggle. Peter's face softens and he shakes his head. \u201cYour mask is ruined. You need to wash that off before we go back to the party or he's going to know as soon as he sees you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, we should put one in the shower head!\u201d Wade doesn't wait to hear Peter's protest or agreement, and takes off for the bathroom.</p>\n<p>The room is off the fucking hook. Wade might even be considering having a shower like that installed in his own place. A giant, open-sided stall with all the massaging heads on the wall and a bench. Of course, he might actually have to spend some of his merc money and get a bigger place, first, because the stall alone is bigger than his <i>bedroom</i>.</p>\n<p>[Imagine getting Spidey in there! Or Peter!]</p>\n<p>Wade is trying not to, as a matter of fact. The main shower head is a long bar along the ceiling. \u201cIs there something to stand on?\u201d he mutters out loud.</p>\n<p>Peter makes an annoyed sound behind him, snatches one of the packs out of Wade's hand, and goes to stand under the head. \u201cI can't believe I'm doing this,\u201d he says, and then, in one fluid motion, does a back flip and lands gracefully on the ceiling. He fidgets around with the dye pack and shower head, before dropping back to his feet. </p>\n<p>With a cheeky smile for Wade, Peter dusts his hands together. \u201cThere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade does an actual double-take, then stands there speechless, frozen in disbelief. \u201cYou--\u201d </p>\n<p>[Maybe that Asgardian shit was stronger than we realised\u2026]</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a whole lot of things are starting to make sense. Like, sure, there could be any number of possibilities for Peter\u2019s sudden manifestation of Spider-Man-esque abilities. But now he\u2019s looking back on basically every interaction they\u2019ve ever had through this new lens, and only one thing makes sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he's totally going to know I helped you,\u201d Peter agrees. <i>Spidey</i> agrees.</p>\n<p>Wade's brain has checked out at this point, allowing the boxes to run free.</p>\n<p>[[I knew it all along.]]</p>\n<p>[Fuck you, no you didn't. Also, holy shit, Spidey is <i>hot</i>. I mean, we always knew he would be, but this is even better than we could have hoped for.]</p>\n<p>[[Except for how you <i>totally blew him off</i>.]]</p>\n<p>[Eek, no wonder Spidey was so butt-hurt when you tried to hit on him.]</p>\n<p>\n<i>God, I\u2019m such a dick.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit\u2014you--\u201d Wade splutters uselessly.</p>\n<p>Peter catches Wade's gobsmacked expression and arches a brow. \u201cYou didn't think it was the suit that let me climb walls, did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly hadn't given it much thought,\u201d Wade says blankly.</p>\n<p>[[That's a fucking lie. You have whole notebooks of self-insertion real person fic about Spidey's origin story and abilities.]]</p>\n<p>Peter\u2014Spidey!!!--reaches out to grab Wade's mask and tugs it off the rest of the way, then twists around to fill the sink with water. \u201cMaybe it'll come out if we soak it.\u201d When he turns back, he cups Wade's cheek and smiles in a fond, sad way that makes Wade's chest ache. His thumb smudges through the ink on Wade's cheek. \u201cYou've got it all over y--\u201d The rest of what Peter was going to say is muffled by Wade's mouth on his. </p>\n<p>This? This is perfect. It means that Spidey <i>wants</i> him, as much as Wade has wanted. Not just for the back up and the one liners and the witty repartee. Not just the late night, post-fight gelato runs and rooftop tacos. Spidey wants to go on coffee dates and to the movies and to make out in broad daylight where anyone can see that he's chosen someone as hideous and morally bankrupt as <i>Deadpool</i>.</p>\n<p>Peter jerks like he\u2019s going to pull away and makes a sound of protest, but then it\u2019s like he melts. His hand slides around to grip the base of Wade's skull, and the other comes up to clutch at Wade's shoulders. He kisses back, parting his mouth to suck Wade's upper lip between his own, his tongue tracing the shape of the bow. It's slick and hot and somehow delicate, like both of them are waiting for the moment to shatter.</p>\n<p>Wade, has <i>no</i> finesse, just stupid, blinding desire. He\u2019s been missing this since the last time they kissed, kicking himself over missing out on the way Peter (SPIDEY!!!) fits just right against him, crushed against him when Wade gets two handfuls of his ass and jerks him close. He nudges a leg between Peter's, rocks up to find his cock growing hard against Wade\u2019s thigh. Licks into his mouth, chasing the flavour of champagne, and Peter <i>Spidey,</i> his mind supplies helpfully, moans and arches against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey,\u201d Wade breaths against his mouth, because he <i>has</i> to, has to say it out loud, just to confirm, and Peter hums as he presses his lips against Wade's again, gives a little nip and says, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>And he knew, of course, all the pieces are coming together now, and how could he miss it at this point? But to hear Peter say it so casually, like he hasn't just turned Wade's whole life upside down. It sends heat shooting through Wade's gut. He clutches Peter tighter, hands on his ass urging him up, and Peter gets the hint, easily bounces up on his toes and slings his legs around Wade's waist. Wade sinks a hand in his hair and guides him into another kiss, and oh, Baby Boy is so good at this. Every slide of his tongue between Wade's lips, every little snag of his teeth against sensitive skin, makes Wade's dick that much harder.</p>\n<p>[So, we're not going to discuss this at all?]</p>\n<p>Discussing seems like a bad idea. They've been doing nothing but talking for weeks, and apparently they've been having very different conversations. Wade can\u2019t help but think of all the moments that now, upon reflection, he was <i>so close</i> to knowing the truth. All that time when they could have been doing this. This is a lot simpler.</p>\n<p>\u201cI've got a new idea to piss off Stark,\u201d Wade says against Peter's lips, as he walks them back into the bedroom. \u201cLet me fuck you in his bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just like that, Peter goes stiff in his arms, and not in the good way. \u201cWade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr you could fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter wriggles out of Wade's hold and pushes him away with a hand to the chest once he's on his feet again. He's got purple ink on his cheek and chin and smeared across his top lip, and he runs a hand through his hair, sticking up all over the place. Wade imagines that's what it looks like when he's first taken off his mask at the end of the night.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr we could just make out,\u201d Wade backtracks quickly. \u201cSome grinding, heavy petting?\u201d <i>Fuck fuck fuck, why do I always have to ruin every single good thing that happens to me?</i></p>\n<p>[[Because you're a masochist, and a shitty one at that.]]</p>\n<p>Peter bites his bottom lip, red and swollen already from Wade's kisses, and oh shit, that does nothing for Wade's self-control. \u201cLook, I can't do this, I'm sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I want to, <i>fuck</i>. The flirting, okay, but I can't just do the making out and the casual sex stuff, especially when you're in love with someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but Baby Boy,\u201d Wade says, and reaches out to take one of Peter's hands. Peter lets him, grudgingly, but he looks downright miserable. \u201cI'm in love with Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, and I can't b--\u201d The words catch up with him and Peter stops mid-word, mouth open like he's ready to speak but has no idea what to say. \u201cWade,\u201d he finally says, very slowly, like he\u2019s talking to a toddler, \u201cI <i>am</i> Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight!\u201d Wade agrees cheerfully. \u201cSo problem solved!\u201d He ducks in for a kiss and Peter brings up his hand, fingers pressed to Wade's lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why would you say all that? Do all--\u201d Peter asks, face contorted into a frown. \u201cWere you just fucking with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, maybe it slipped your attention,\u201d and maybe it had, Wade is willing to give Peter the benefit of the doubt here, as much as it's hurt in the past to know he was the only one not in on Peter's secret, \u201cbut you've never told me your secret identity. No name, no stupidly pretty face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony said you took off my mask, when we were fighting the Kree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade throws his hands in the air. \u201cYou were having trouble <i>breathing</i>, Jesus Christ, what a fucking dick. I was trying to help!\u201d He strokes a hand down Peter's cheek, and then he can't help himself, eyes drawn to the shape of Peter's mouth. He traces along the swell of his bottom lip with his thumb, smiling when Peter's breath catches in his chest. \u201cI didn't look. I know how you feel about your identity. I wouldn't do you like that, Spidey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peter's eyes widen briefly, and then he's suddenly all over Wade, jumping up again to lock his legs in the small of his back, sending Wade stumbling back a few steps before he catches himself. Arms and mouth full, all Wade can do is make a sound of appreciation and try to keep up with Peter's kiss. His hands grip the back of Wade's head to hold him in place when he draws back just enough to ask, \u201cDid you just say you were in love with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade smiles. He has a feeling it looks pretty goofy, but Peter's eyes are suspiciously wet, and he has that sort of effect on Wade. \u201cWell, duh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says, and presses another hot, breath-stealing kiss to Wade's mouth. He pulls away with a groan that makes Wade's dick throb painfully and reaches between them to fumble with the fastenings of Wade's pants. \u201cYeah, let's do it. Let's totally fuck on Stark's bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>That's basically as good as an <i>I love you, too</i> as far as Wade is concerned.</p>\n<p>Wade tumbles Peter onto the bed\u2014as ridiculous as everything else about this place, easily big enough to sleep five\u2014and Peter climbs up on his knees to grab Wade by the belt and haul him close. \u201cI can't believe you didn't know it was me,\u201d he laughs, mouth pressed against Wade's throat while he unbuckles the belt. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, in my defense...\u201d Wade trails off, distracted by the thing Peter's doing with his tongue against his pulse. And the fact that Peter's totally right. Now that Wade knows he's sort of gobsmacked by the fact he hadn't noticed sooner. \u201cIn my defense, you are stupidly hot, and I was mostly functioning in a state of disbelief that someone who looks like you could want anything to do with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWade,\u201d Peter admonishes. Wade can feel his smile against his skin, which might be his new favourite sensation. That is, right up to the point that Peter sinks his hand down the front of Wade's pants and wraps around his cock. Wade makes an embarrassing sound and Peter chuckles and sucks gently up the line of his neck to snag Wade's earlobe between his teeth.</p>\n<p>He should move\u2014he should do <i>something</i>. White and Yellow are eagerly offering their backseat driver suggestions. About the conveniently placed zipper right down the front of Peter's jumpsuit, and the way Peter's ass fits perfectly in his hands, and how those cherry red lips would look wrapped around his cock. But Peter feels so good. His grip just the right side of tight, and the slow, dry drag of his palm from root to tip before swiping his thumb over the head. Wade's hips stutter into the touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI've been going crazy trying to figure out why you were all over me one minute and shutting me down the next,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm so sorry, babe,\u201d Wade moans. \u201cLet me make it up to you.\u201d He goes for the zipper of Peter's costume and has to pull back and watch as it parts. It's not quite the same as all his fantasies of stripping Spidey out of his suit, but that hardly matters when all Peter's perfect, pale gold skin is on display. There's a flush over his chest and throat, darkening the lower Wade drags the zipper and the more is revealed.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, look at you,\u201d Wade breathes, when the zipper ends just below Peter's belly button. The smooth cut of his muscle is not as defined or bulky as Wade's own but beautifully chiseled. Sort of slender, compact, and graceful like a gymnast. Wade pushes the jumpsuit from his shoulders and Peter unclasps the pipboy and throws it aside, then shucks the sleeves from his arms and pushes the suit down over his hips. He sits back to kick off one leg then the other, til all he's left in are his boxers, and Wade doesn't know where to start.</p>\n<p>Yellow is making a hard case for finding where Stark keeps the lube and jumping straight to the main feature. And White\u2014well, Wade didn't even know such a thing was possible, but White is apparently shocked into silence by the sight of mostly naked Peter. It <i>is</i> a mouth-watering sight.</p>\n<p>Wade goes with instinct and lets himself touch, hands smoothing up the hard planes of Peter's stomach to the curve of his waist, pulling him closer as he ducks his head to suck one dusky nipple between his lips. Peter's breath catches, stomach going concave. Wade flicks the flat of his tongue against the peak before scraping his teeth over the sensitive skin, and Peter's fingers come up to caress Wade's head. When Wade's hands find the elastic of his waistband, his fingers dig in tighter, but he gives no protest as Wade slides the boxers down over his hips.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh-ho Spidey,\u201d Wade whispers, and drops to his knees on the floor in worship. Peter's cock is rock-hard and red, bobbing in his face like it's waving hello. Wade places a kiss on the head and is rewarded by a rush of precum. \u201cHello.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snorts. \u201cWade, you're such an--\u201d Then Wade pulls him in by the hips and swallows him down until Peter's cock is nudging the back of his throat. \u201cOh fuck, you\u2014you're mouth, Wade.\u201d Wade hums around his mouthful, draws back just to fit his tongue along the underside, press hard against the roof of his mouth, and <i>suck</i>. Peter's grip is going to leave little fingerprint bruises all over his skull, but it's totally worth it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Wade teases, when he pulls back. He looks up at Peter from under his lashes with a coy smile, and swirls his tongue around the head. Peter laughs a little breathlessly and nudges forward to rub his dick over Wade\u2019s lips, and Wade sucks him back down. </p>\n<p>The weight of him in Wade\u2019s mouth is so fucking good, the stretch of his jaw, the taste of Peter leaking onto his tongue. Wade could suck him off for hours. Take Peter apart with nothing but his mouth, bringing him right up to the edge over and over again before finally letting him cum. And even then, not stopping. He wants to hear Peter\u2019s wounded little sound when Wade keeps licking him after. Cleaning up every drop of cum from his over-sensitised skin until Peter\u2019s hard again and ready to do it all over.</p>\n<p>Wade pulls off Peter\u2019s dick to say as much, muffled as he licks and kisses his way down to suck first one, then the other of Peter\u2019s balls between his lips. Peter\u2019s cock jerks in response to the words, little dribbles of precum waiting for Wade to lick them up. \u201cFuck, Wade, if you keep talking like that--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that do it for ya, Spidey?\u201d Wade asks, switching from mouth to hand, jerking Peter off with a loose, leisurely stroke. He rises up, tracing a path with his tongue up Peter\u2019s belly and across his chest as stands. \u201cLike it when I talk dirty?\u201d He hums in question as he flicks one nipple between tongue and teeth. \u201cAll those times we were working a job and I made some comment about what I\u2019d like to do to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter lets out a low, shaky moan, and Wade grins, teeth sharp against Peter\u2019s bottom lip. He gives a tug and Peter opens to welcome him in. \u201cWere you getting all hot and bothered? Getting hard in your Spidey suit? Wanting me to push you up against the wall of some dirty alley, just rip open your suit and go to town on your ass right there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWade.\u201d Peter thrusts into his grip erratically. \u201cI thought...you said...you were gonna fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade chuckles. \u201cGetting impatient?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not have Tony Stark or Pepper Potts walk in on us,\u201d Peter says. \u201cSo. Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, okay,\u201d Wade says, putting a little bit of distance between their lips. \u201cWe need a rule about no talking about your dad during sex. Total boner killer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cOh my god, then maybe you should shut me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Never let it be said that Wade isn\u2019t up to a challenge. Quick as a flash he\u2019s got Peter face down, sprawled out on the sheets, and he doesn\u2019t even put up any sort of reflexive fight. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d Peter sounds astonished as Wade at the fact, and seriously turned on. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even make my Spidey-Sense tingle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade, fishing around in the bedside drawer, snickers. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll be feeling a tingle here in a minute.\u201d He finds the lube, in a fucking crystal pump bottle, of all the fucking things, but all his derisive thoughts roll to a stop when he pumps some into his hand and feels the silky smooth glide of it.</p>\n<p>Peter casually crosses his arms under his chin and turns his head to watch Wade. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re all talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s time to put my money where my mouth is,\u201d Wade says, as he climbs up on the bed. Then he stops and frowns, head cocked to the side. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense. I\u2019m not putting any money up your ass. My cock where my mouth is? I mean, not that my mouth is on your ass, but I\u2019d totally be into that--would you be into that, Spidey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, Wade, as long as something is in my ass, I don\u2019t give a flying--oh!\u201d </p>\n<p>Wade slides one slick finger between his cheeks and down until he finds the puckered hole, and Petey opens just enough to let it slip inside to the first knuckle. His forehead flops down to the bed, body drawn tense, breath still, and Wade waits for him to adjust to the sudden intrusion, exhale, and then he pushes deeper, in one slow, steady glide until he\u2019s in all the way to the join of his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re tight,\u201d Wade breathes. \u201cYou ever done this before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter swallows audibly and gives a little rock of his hips when Wade starts to move, dragging his finger slowly out and back in again. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d He sounds dazed, and Wade sort of wishes he could see his face right now, lost and sweet. \u201cI\u2019ve done it,\u201d he says, around panting breaths. \u201cI mean, to myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade bends down to watch his finger disappearing into Peter\u2019s body. Spreads his cheeks open with his thumbs and squeezes in a second finger, and after the momentarily resistance, it glides in as easily as the first. Peter moans and spreads his legs open wider. The tiny, restless jerks of hips grind his cock against the comforter, no doubt smearing precum everywhere, and Wade can\u2019t help but grin at the idea of Stark knowing exactly what happened here, and that it was Deadpool who defiled his precious little Spidey.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Wade asks. He spreads his fingers apart and works Peter open, trying to commit every second to memory. Every little sound Peter makes, and the way he feels inside, in case this is some hallucination, or Spidey comes to his senses, at least he\u2019ll have this to revisit. \u201cYou fuck yourself on your fingers thinking about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods his head jerkily. \u201cUh huh.\u201d Wade rewards that little bit of honesty with the drag of his fingertips across the prostate, and Peter cries out. The muscles of his back and legs ripple, a reminder of his strength and power, all carefully caged beneath Wade\u2019s body. It\u2019s impossibly hot. \u201cWade,\u201d he whines, and twists his hips to press harder back on Wade\u2019s fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t--I\u2019m too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh.\u201d Wade presses a kiss to one pert asscheek, and then he has to take a nibble that earns him a squeak and twitch, with Peter\u2019s ass clenching down on his fingers. <i>Fuck</i> Spidey\u2019s ass is perfect, and he just wants to mark it all up. Wants to dig his fingers in, spread Spidey open and just lick and suck until he\u2019s a whimpering mess. </p>\n<p>Just thinking about it has Wade hard enough to hammer nails. Making a wet spot on the front of his Wolvie costume. And Peter is a fucking wet dream splayed out beneath him, face turned to the side, eyes squeezed shut tight, cheeks flushed, lip caught between his teeth. Wade\u2019s white-knuckled grip on his self-control is slipping fast. He pumps more of the lube over his fingers and pushes it in Peter\u2019s hole along with a third.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Peter cries, hands flailing out to grasp the sheets. His spine twists and arches as he settles into the stretch, and Wade can see the exact second he relaxes into it, the tension in his face bleeding away to pleasure. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade opens the zip of his pants and reaches in to let his cock spring free. He smacks it against the curve of Peter\u2019s ass and says, \u201cGot something even bigger for ya, Baby Boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey must be pretty far fucking gone, because he doesn\u2019t even comment on Wade\u2019s inappropriate sense of humour. \u201cI swear to god Wade, if you don\u2019t fuck me soon, I\u2019m going to hold you down and ride you like a fucking racehorse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d Wade grins, and traces the head of his cock over Peter\u2019s skin, leaving a shiney streak of precum. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me when you can\u2019t walk straight, after,\u201d he says, drawing back and then shoving all three fingers in deep. \u201cLimping around the party.\u201d He leans up to whisper in Peter\u2019s ear. \u201cEveryone knowing what we\u2019ve been up to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you better fuck me good,\u201d Peter whispers back. \u201cIf you want everyone to see. Hard enough that I\u2019ll still feel it, even with my healing.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Fuck, he\u2019s amazing. We have to keep him.]</p>\n<p>There is literally <i>no way</i> Wade can resist that. He straightens up to hastily pour lube over his cock and jerk it a couple of times, not that he can get any harder than he already is right now. \u201cJust remember you asked for it.\u201d He nudges forward, cock lined up to where his fingers split Peter open, and pulls them free as he pushes in.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Wade grunts. His eyes fall shut, unable to keep them open as much as he\u2019d like to watch. Peter\u2019s so goddamn tight, his body opening just enough to let Wade in and no more, practically sucking him deeper. \u201cOh, shit, Spidey.\u201d He bottoms out in one long, deep thrust, bodies flush, and bends forward to press his forehead between Peter\u2019s shoulder blades. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo long,\u201d he mutters, lips moving against Spidey\u2019s skin. He rocks his hips back, pulling out until only the very tip of his dick is breaching Peter\u2019s body. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this for so--\u201d he thrusts in deep and hard, and Spidey cries out. \u201cfucking\u201d Wade does it again, harder and faster. \u201clong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s hand unclenches from the sheets to find Wade\u2019s braced by his head, and threads their fingers together. \u201cMe--ah--too.\u201d He rocks back to meet Wade\u2019s next thrust and his ass clenches down, like he\u2019s trying to pull Wade even deeper. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s so fucking tight in this position, but there\u2019s only so far Wade can reach like this. He smacks one open palm against Peter\u2019s ass and pulls out, and says, \u201cUp on your knees.\u201d Peter rises up on shaky limbs, knees spread. His weight on his hands gives him the leverage to push back on Wade\u2019s dick when he slides in again, a little more open now, really letting Wade sink in.</p>\n<p>Wade has to take a minute to breathe deep so he doesn\u2019t embarrass himself by coming right then and there, and then he\u2019s setting up a brutal pace. Good fucking thing the party downstairs is loud and the soundproofing in this place is top of the line, because the frame of the bed knocks against the wall with every thrust, and Spidey isn\u2019t shy with his approval. Every breathy moan, every cry, every gasp echoes through the room and goes straight to Wade\u2019s dick.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always boasted about his control and stamina, but leave it to Spidey to strip all that away and leave him shaking with how bad he needs it. Wade shifts all his weight to one hand to get the other on Peter\u2019s cock. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like you to come on my dick without being touched, it\u2019s gonna have to wait for another time,\u201d he manages. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna last that long.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter starts to laugh, but it ends on a sharp cry when Wade slams into him. \u201cAll those times you bragged about what a great lover you were\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade hooks his arm around Peter\u2019s neck and sits up, pulling Peter with him, legs splayed on either side of Wade\u2019s lap and <i>oh</i> that lets him get deep. Peter moans and grinds down on Wade\u2019s cock with a hot, slow roll of his hips that has Wade gritting his teeth against cumming. He spreads his hand over Peter\u2019s throat, fingers curled around his chin to guide his face to the side where their lips can meet in a messy, off-centre kiss. </p>\n<p>Peter reaches back to hold him in place, fingers slipping sweaty over Wade\u2019s skull. His body undulates in a elegant movement, over and over, using Wade to fuck himself and Wade can tell he\u2019s close, too. There\u2019s a desperation in him, a single-minded focus on splitting himself open on Wade\u2019s cock in the clumsy, distracted way he sucks Wade\u2019s tongue. </p>\n<p>Wade draws on his last reserve of self-discipline to piston his hips fast, in time with the blur of his hand on Peter\u2019s cock, and anyone else would probably complain it\u2019s too fast, too rough, too much, but Peter just moans, \u201cMore, Wade, fuck.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wade gives it to him, fucking <i>tears</i> Peter\u2019s orgasm out of him, brings down his other hand to massage Peter\u2019s balls, his fingers dipping lower to brush against Peter\u2019s hole stretched wide around his cock. Thinks idly about sinking another finger in there alongside, how Peter would squirm and squeal and <i>take it</i> and has to tell himself <i>another day</i> because neither of them are going to last that long. </p>\n<p>But his fingers tease the sensitive ring of muscles that open for him, and his other hand tightens on Peter\u2019s cock on the upstroke, and then Peter\u2019s cumming, back bowed away from Wade\u2019s chest, white striping across Stark\u2019s comforter and fancy pillows. Pulse after pulse, slicking up the way under Wade\u2019s fist, messy and stupidly, impossibly hot. Wade sucks on Peter\u2019s throat, imagining the taste of him, and it\u2019s a combination of all those things, and the way Peter\u2019s hole tightens rhythmically around him, that has Wade\u2019s hips stuttering. He buries himself in Peter, sounds muffled against his skin, as he empties deep inside.</p>\n<p>Even then, it doesn\u2019t feel like coming down. He\u2019s still buzzing on the high of having Peter\u2019s close, and all the places their skin meet. Already wants to go again, but without his costume in the way. To feel all Peter\u2019s silky-perfect skin sliding and catching on his own. And of course, in awe of the fact that Peter, apparently, wants the same thing. He nuzzles the mark he\u2019s left on Peter\u2019s throat, already fading from a dark purple to a lighter pink. It\u2019ll be gone entirely in another couple of minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Spidey,\u201d he whispers, \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t too married to the whole college education thing, because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you out of bed for, like, the next month at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter chuckles, hand coming up to rest over Wade\u2019s, braced against his stomach. Now, without the immediacy of his need distracting him, Wade can appreciate all the different sensations--the weight of Peter in his lap, and the racing of his heartbeat thumping against Wade\u2019s palm, beneath his lips, the little trembling after-shocks skipping through Peter\u2019s muscles, and Wade\u2019s cock going soft inside him. Peter pats his hand and lays his head back on Wade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming I\u2019d try to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, I love you,\u201d Wade breathes, and he can see Peter\u2019s profile lighting up, the stretch of half his smile spread wide across his cheek. Peter squeezes his fingers and kisses the underside of Wade\u2019s jaw and says, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Peter groans, an indeterminate time later, nudging his elbow in Wade\u2019s chest. Wade grumbles and shifts above him from where they\u2019ve collapsed together on the sheets. \u201cOh my god we just trashed Mister Stark\u2019s bed. After helping you plant dye packs around his room.\u201d He face plants in the pillow. His voice is muffled. \u201cI'm dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade presses a kiss between his shoulder blades and lifts his head to assess the damage. That\u2019s definitely cum on the headboard and maybe on the wallpaper, and somehow Stark\u2019s fancy lube has spilled off the nightstand and onto the floor.</p>\n<p>[[Stark is going to find a way to actually permanently kill you for deflowering Spidey in his bed]]</p>\n<p>\u201cWorth it,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSays you,\u201d Peter fires back, raising his head to give Wade a baleful look. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to face him on a regular basis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade gets to his feet and smacks Peter on the ass, just to admire the way it jiggles. Peter doesn't even react; he just stares morosely at the cumstained bedspread. \u201cCome on.\u201d Wade tugs on his hand. \u201cYou go de-boobie the shower while I clean up in here, and then I\u2019ll join you in there for round two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWade.\u201d The absurdity of it all sinks in, and Peter begins to laugh, shaking his head. He loops his arms around Wade\u2019s shoulders, still laughing when he presses their mouths together. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to die of shame anyway, we might as well,\u201d he murmurs against Wade\u2019s lips. </p>\n<p>With a little rock of his hips to show he\u2019s already half-hard again, Peter pulls away. \u201cHurry up.\u201d Apparently any concerns of what Stark\u2019s going to do when he finds out have been overridden by desire at this point, which is really flattering, and also hot as fuck.</p>\n<p>[I think Petey might be the one to actually kill us.]</p>\n<p>[[And what a way to go\u2026]]</p>\n<p>The lube cleans up easily enough, though it does leave the wood of the nightstand looking suspiciously shiny. The bedspread is frankly a lost cause. They waited far too long. He wipes up what he can and flips the pillowcases over, and it looks good enough for now, but Stark\u2019s gonna know what he\u2019s smelling the second he lays down, and Wade isn\u2019t the slightest bit repentant.</p>\n<p>Peter has <i>not</i> de-boobie-trapped the shower, but is in fact standing in front of the floor length mirror, fingers stroking absently over the fading bruises on his hips. Wade has to take a minute to appreciate the image, and maybe pinch himself, because how is this real life? How is Peter so fucking perfect for him <i>and</i> he\u2019s Spider-Man, <i>and</i> he wants Wade back.</p>\n<p>Wade comes up behind him, wrapping an arm around his waist to pull them flush together and drops a kiss to the curve of Peter\u2019s neck, then just buries his face there and breathes in the smell of them. He nudges forward, cock growing harder in the groove of Peter\u2019s ass, and the movement pushes Peter up against the smooth surface of the mirror.</p>\n<p>\u201cWade,\u201d he moans. It almost sounds like a protest except for the way his arm comes up to wind around Wade\u2019s neck and hold him into place. Peter rocks backwards and then forwards again, a delicate little shudder running through him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d Wade hums. He strokes idly up Peter\u2019s stomach as he drinks in their reflection. The red flush spreading down Peter\u2019s throat and chest, the bitten pink of his lips, the glassy look in his eyes when they meet Wade\u2019s. \u201cOh the things I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s all but panting already, squirming between the hard, hot line of Wade\u2019s body and the cool press of the glass, where the tip of his dick leaves a new streak every time they rock forward. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade opens his mouth to start to rattling off the list he\u2019s been compiling since basically the moment he first laid eyes on Spidey, but then Peter freezes up, eyes wide. Wade knows that look, though admittedly he\u2019s used to seeing it on a fully clothed and masked Spidey. He\u2019d like to think he\u2019s the reason for his senses to be tingling, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.</p>\n<p>\u201cPete?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s--\u201d Peter pushes him off and grabs Wade by the wrist, dragging him back the way they came, snagging pieces of their costumes as he goes. They barely make it into the walk-in closet before the bedroom door opens. </p>\n<p>Whoever Peter was anticipating, Wade is willing to lay odds that it wasn\u2019t Bucky and Steve, stumbling blindly through the room not bothering to part at the mouth long enough to look where they\u2019re going. A lamp and what looks to be a priceless vase are just a couple pieces of the collateral damage of their journey to the bed, where Cap lands solidly on his back with a grunt. Bucky\u2019s already between his legs, working down the zipper, when Peter\u2019s hand covers Wade\u2019s eyes, and he drags him deeper into the closet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey,\u201d Wade hisses, \u201cthis is like, all of my childhood fantasies playing out on that bed right now, you <i>have</i> to let me look.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter actually seems torn, like maybe he has some of those same fantasies.</p>\n<p>[[Ayyy!]]</p>\n<p>[Somewhere in our wicked, miserable past, we must have done something good]</p>\n<p>Wade scowls. Julie Andrews deserves better than Yellow obnoxiously off-key singing.</p>\n<p>In the end, Spidey\u2019s morals win out over his horniness--</p>\n<p>[[Sadly]]</p>\n<p>--and he shoves a handful of spandex at Wade and tells him to get dressed. It\u2019s trickier than expected in the dark of the closet, and it definitely seems tighter than before, sticking to all the places he\u2019s sweaty and still covered in cum and lube.</p>\n<p>When Cap and Bucky sound sufficiently distracted, Peter leads the way, sneaking around the opposite side of the room to the maid\u2019s entrance. Wade can\u2019t help but steal a single glance backward, and the sight will forever be burned into his memory. Captain America, sprawled-out naked and all golden skinned on Tony Stark\u2019s bed, chest heaving like he\u2019s dying. Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes between his thighs, deep-throating like a fucking champ. Oh yeah.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is <i>really</i> good sound-proofing,\u201d Wade remarks, when they\u2019re safely back on the second floor. The party has increased in both volume and drunkenness. No one immediately appears to have noticed their absence. But still, Peter\u2019s back is unnaturally straight and stiff, and he\u2019s got an apprehensive look about him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Wade says carefully. \u201cAt least now you don\u2019t have to worry about Stark knowing what <i>we</i> were up to.\u201d He jerks a thumb back at the stairs. \u201cSomething tells me Barnes isn't going to bother cleaning up after.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turns to him, face softening into something undeniably fond. He lifts a hand to stroke Wade\u2019s cheek, and that\u2019s when it occurs to Wade that he still isn\u2019t wearing his mask. The concern that he left it upstairs evaporates when Peter closes the distance between them to brush a kiss over his lips. \u201cWade, I don\u2019t care if Mister Stark knows what we were doing. I'd just rather him not know <i>where</i> we\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade draws him closer and takes a chance at deepening the kiss. The novelty of being allowed this is never going to fade. To lick past Peter\u2019s lips, and have Peter open for him so eagerly. The way Peter sinks closer in Wade\u2019s hold until they\u2019re pressed flush together, and hums in pleasure at the roll of Wade\u2019s tongue in his mouth.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re jostled apart by the appearance of Natasha at their shoulder, surprisingly unsteady on her feet. Between her training, heritage, and general badassitude, Wade sorta didn\u2019t imagine her the tipsy type. \u201cWoah.\u201d He grabs her elbow, but Natasha shrugs him off and totters a step back. \u201cJust how much of Thor\u2019s baby juice have you had?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter thumps his head on Wade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOh my god don\u2019t call it that,\u201d he says under his breath.</p>\n<p>Natasha gives Wade an imperious look, one eyebrow raising impossibly high. \u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least Peter looks as confused as Wade feels. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint sidles up to Natasha, snuggling drunkenly into the curve of her bosom, and Natasha takes advantage of the convenient armrest made by the shelf of his shoulders. She points at Wade with one fingertip, the rest wrapped around her precariously full martini glass. \u201cStark\u2019s been tearing the place apart looking for you for the last half-hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you two show back up looking like that!\u201d Clint dissolves into giggles, from somewhere near Natasha\u2019s armpit.</p>\n<p>[Oh my god is your dick out???]</p>\n<p>[[It <i>has happened before</i>]]</p>\n<p>\u201cOne time!\u201d Wade snaps, ducking his head down to check, just in case.</p>\n<p>[[Three, at least, in my recollection]]</p>\n<p>Suits are tricky, okay, and sometimes things get overlooked when you have to hurry into battle! No one ever wants to address superheroes needing to take a piss.</p>\n<p>It takes a second for Wade\u2019s brain to catch up with what his eyes are seeing. After all, the fabric is still yellow and blue. Peter is coming to the same conclusion, if his slightly hysterical giggles are anything to go by. He\u2019s not disentangling himself from Wade, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make a hot X-Person, Spidey.\u201d</p>\n<p>[The just-been-fucked hair definitely helps.]</p>\n<p>Peter snorts and and wipes the tears at the corner of his eyes, still chuckling. He tugs lightly on the zipper up the front of the Vault Suit that Wade now wears. \u201cSo, uh, this is probably not the best time to discuss my Ghoul kink that you\u2019re currently fulfilling...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, babe.\u201d Wade bounces excitedly. \u201cDo I get to play your Hancock?\u201d He let his voice drop down in register, mimicking Hancock\u2019s. \u201cHave some impure thoughts you\u2019d like to act on?\u201d </p>\n<p>Peter waggles his brows, despite the bright blush staining his cheeks. Wade can\u2019t help but think of all the times he\u2019s flirted with Spidey in the past, never knowing the effect he was having.</p>\n<p>[[Oh this is going to make teasing him so much more fun!]]</p>\n<p>\u201cGag,\u201d Natasha says blandly, over Hawkeye\u2019s continued laughter. \u201cIf I say \u2018get a room,\u2019 I sincerely hope you\u2019ll choose a better one than last time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter makes a miserable sort of sound, melting into Wade as if he can hide in the confines of his arms. \u201cWell jokes on you \u2018cause Bucky\u2019s up there with Cap right now and he is Getting It, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never took you for an idiot, Wilson,\u201d Natasha says, \u201cbut if you don\u2019t think Stark\u2019s got Friday recording everything that happens in this place, then I\u2019m going to have to reassess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Even Peter\u2019s ears are pink at this point. \u201cNot even twenty and I\u2019ve already starred in my first porno. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to kill me first: Mister Stark, Aunt May, or the crippling shame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Wade smirks. \u201cWe\u2019d be a best-seller. Well. You would at any rate.\u201d </p>\n<p>Natasha is not very subtle about checking them both out, then shrugs and throws back her almost entirely full drink in one swallow. \u201cI\u2019d buy it.\u201d Clint hums a sound that might be agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the whole point, anyway,\u201d Wade mutters. \u201cNot making a porno, I mean.\u201d He meets Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m just an fuckup who you wouldn\u2019t give the time of day, and you\u2019re just a kid who has to be protected from the likes of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter straightens up, something like steel glinting in his eyes, but before he can speak, Stark\u2019s voice cuts through the chaos of the party.</p>\n<p>\u201cWILSON.\u201d </p>\n<p>For a second, when Peter pulls away, Wade can\u2019t blame him, but he is disappointed in himself for expecting any different. Except then Peter angles himself between Wade and Stark, who\u2019s barrelling towards them, and Wade realises Peter\u2019s setting himself up as his <i>protector</i> or some ridiculous shit, and Wade\u2019s tired old heart flutters in joy.</p>\n<p>Stark draws up short at the sight of him, and Natasha and Clint just sort of...disappear into the crowd, fucking spies. Pepper Potts and some stocky, personal security-type guy who looks vaguely familiar hover at either side of Stark's shoulders. Wade\u2019s mind unhelpfully conjures up images of the Plastics, and he does his best to stifle his laughter. For Petey\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p>Stark blinks, then narrows his gaze at Wade, before turning his attention back at Peter. \u201cPete...are you...okay? Pepper told me that <i>he</i> came with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s lips twitch in amusement. \u201cSlightly after,\u201d he says. \u201cBut close enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade lays his head on Peter\u2019s shoulder, shaking with silent laughter. Stark clears his throat, clearly someone unused to being confused and not happy about it. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d he asks, incredulous. \"Has someone been giving drinks to the minor??\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm almost twenty!\u201d Peter protests, at the same time Wade says, \u201cLike you\u2019re one to talk,\u201d and Natasha\u2019s voice floats from somewhere in the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the tabloid photos, Tony!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark\u2019s mouth, poised to say something else, snaps closed and he points blindly in Natasha\u2019s direction. \u201cThat. Is beside the point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, no, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Peter crosses his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen help me out here, Peter,\u201d Stark says through clenched teeth. \u201cBecause I\u2019m trying to figure out what other excuse you could have for your judgement being so impaired that you trusted <i>Deadpool</i> with your identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Several people around them are trying to stealthily slink away, while others are pretending not to be listening in and failing. </p>\n<p>[Earth\u2019s mightiest right here, folks.]</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Wade and I work together a lot. I\u2019ve lost track of the number of times he\u2019s saved my life. And anyway, it would be weird, not telling my boyfriend my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boxes are fucking squeeing, which is always a nice change of pace from ridicule.</p>\n<p>Potts is going on an epic face journey, and the bodyguard dude's jaw just drops, but Stark\u2019s brain hasn\u2019t finished processing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to team up with him. If you need something, you can call Happy, or me. There\u2019s always a place for you here, with the Avengers, and Jesus Christ, did you just saying <i>boyfriend?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLay off the kid, Stark.\u201d Bucky ambles down the stairs, making no attempt to hide where he\u2019s coming from, and looks utterly unashamed. Both he and Steve are stained purple around their faces and the crown of Cap\u2019s blond hair, and Wade cringes at the same time Pete sucks his teeth in realisation that they\u2019d obviously tried to shower after their quickie.</p>\n<p>\u201cQueue our exit, babe,\u201d Wade whispers. \u201cWhile your Iron Daddy is distracted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that just sounds wrong,\u201d Peter hisses back. \u201cNo more nicknames. I am making a rule right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark rubs at his brow and pushes back his hair. \u201cDo I even want to know what you two were doing up there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cap looks anywhere but Stark\u2019s face with an expression like butter wouldn\u2019t melt in his mouth. Bucky just smirks and shrugs. \u201cHate to tell you we weren\u2019t even the first of the evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha and Clint are <i>cackling</i> from minimal safe distance.</p>\n<p>Wade tugs on his arm, but he\u2019s reminded of how strong Spidey is when he doesn\u2019t budge from the spot. He shrugs off Wade\u2019s hand and throws back his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about the mess, Mister Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark pivots on his heels to face Peter with a stunned expression, mouth parted in dumb surprise. Peter\u2019s bright red, but he\u2019s not backing down. \u201cWade will replace anything we damaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>At Peter\u2019s elbow in his gut, Wade nods his head vigorously. \u201cYes. New sheets, and pillows. Maybe a new bed just to be safe. And I\u2019ll buy you some more of that fancy lube.\u201d He holds his hand up, thumb and index fingers pressed together and winks at Pepper. \u201cGreat stuff, I\u2019mma have to get some for myself!\u201d</p>\n<p>For a long second, Stark just stares at him, nonplussed, and Wade is starting to worry he\u2019s stroked out. \u201cI\u2019m. I\u2019m not sure I follow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is clearly similarly concerned, his voice gentle when he speaks. \u201cLook, Mister Stark, I appreciate all you do for me, but I\u2019m not a kid anymore--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is debatable,\u201d Stark interjects.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I can team up with, or date, or have sex with whoever I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potts makes a strange sound and Stark looks skyward. \u201cWhere did I go wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not his real papa!\u201d Wade yells.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Peter continues on as if he weren\u2019t interrupted, voice raising slightly, \u201cthe person I want to do those things with is Wade, so, I hope you can respect that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade, utterly smitten, presses a kiss to his cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head, somewhere between exasperation and amusement. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark, who hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off Wade since his little outburst regarding Peter\u2019s parentage, narrows his eyes. \u201cI take your point, Peter,\u201d he says slowly and finally redirects his attention to Peter. \u201cBut did you have to make it <i>in my bed</i>?\"</p>\n<p>Wade claps his hands. \"Are we one big happy family now?\"</p>\n<p>\"You.\u201d Stark steps forward, angling himself at Wade and taps his fingers against his chest. They both know Wade's the stronger one, with Stark out of his suit, but he lets himself be pushed back until he's against the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t think I even need to tell you what\u2019s gonna happen if you step one toe out of line.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah yeah.\u201d Wade rolls his eyes and waves his hand around at the collected eighty or so superheroes milling around the place. \u201cI getta deal with you and everyone else in the place. But see, Stark, I think you\u2019re still missing the point. I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m not a colossal fuck up, and Christ knows why Peter wants me. The <i>point is</i>, when I do inevitably fuck up, Peter can take care of it himself, \u2018cause he\u2019s a big boy now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, be that as it may,\u201d Stark grits out, \u201cit would just give me so much personal satisfaction to, you know, help him out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, Tony, enough posturing.\u201d Potts pats him on the shoulder a couple of times. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Peter.\u201d She looks from him to Wade and back again, then gives him a tight-lipped smile like she has no idea what to say. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, apparently, things are back to normal, with Potts leading Stark away, and the party carrying on. Bucky comes up to clap Wade on the shoulder and grins broadly at Peter. \u201cThanks for taking the heat off us, Pete.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, any idea about my new hairdo, by the way?\u201d Cap runs a hair over the purple streaks.</p>\n<p>Wade finger guns him. \u201cLooks good on you, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Peter says, but ruins it by how obviously he's trying not to laugh. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey, there you losers are,\u201d Sam says, coming up and knocking shoulders a little too roughly with Bucky. \u201cThor was looking for you, DP. Something about being partners for doubles beer pong against Valkyrie and Okoye?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this real life?\u201d Wade asks Peter gleefully.</p>\n<p>Peter leans in to peck a quick kiss against his lips. \u201cI\u2019d wish you luck, but let\u2019s be real, you don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Sam leads him away, Wade catches Natasha making her way back over, congratulating Peter on finally growing a pair and making a move. He\u2019s kind of sad he won\u2019t see Spidey\u2019s blushing response, but BEER PONG WITH THOR AND OKOYE AND THE FUCKING VALKYRIE!</p>\n<p>It turns out he and Thor do indeed lose, and spectacularly so, doing shots of Thor\u2019s God Ale every time the ladies score a point against them. Okoye fucks off after trouncing them, and Banner takes over for her. Somehow they still lose, Banner and Valkyrie shouting \"DRANK\" obnoxiously every time they score. Wade is sure there\u2019s a great story about how brotp those two are with one another that he's just dying to hear.</p>\n<p>Then Loki shows up, and has some things to say about Wade telling people they\u2019re related. Wade is a little too drunk and a little too busy laughing hysterically at the way Thor stands behind Loki's shoulders, mimicking his annoyed expression, to really follow it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come now, Brother,\u201d Thor bellows, throwing his arm around Loki and speaking over his increasingly aggrieved tone, \u201cyou must admit Wade shares your own appreciation for wreaking havoc in the name of creating mischief.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Loki allows, mouth twitching and eyes sparkling. \u201cI am rather fond of the way Stark\u2019s eye ticks whenever you steal one of his vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time Spidey shows up, Valkyrie has cracked open some of her own alien booze and has drunk Loki literally under the table, and at some point Wade and Thor figured it was a good idea to join them. That\u2019s where Peter finds them, lifting up the tablecloth and squatting to look at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh!\u201d Thor roars.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey, you have to try Brunhilde\u2019s space vodka.\u201d Wade holds out a cup to him. Peter ignores him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you find us?\u201d Thor asks, in what he probably thinks is a whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys have been moving the table back and forth across the room for like the last hour,\u201d Peter stage whispers back. \u201cI\u2019m going to steal Wade now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy son!\u201d Loki calls, reaching after him, from where he\u2019s only upright thanks to his position propped up between Valkyrie and Thor. Banner is passed out in his lap with impossibly tiny braids in his fringe. Wade is glad he\u2019s taken a hundred horrible selfies with them all over the last hour or so, because he\u2019s not going to believe any of this actually happened tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for inviting me, Mister Stark,\u201d Peter calls, as he\u2019s dragging Wade towards the door leading into the veranda.</p>\n<p>Stark waves them off. \u201cI guess I should just be thankful that your boyfriend and Loki didn\u2019t start some interdimensional incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey Spidey,\" Wade whispers in his ear, when the door closes and the sounds of the party cut off abruptly beyond the door. \"Spidey, now that we\u2019re knocking boots, does that mean I get free web-slinging piggy-back rides.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gave you those before!\u201d Peter says, but he doesn\u2019t put up any protest when Wade scrambles onto his back. He huffs a breath, hoists Wade higher, and checks to make sure there\u2019s no one around before swinging off.</p>\n<p>Between his accelerated healing and the cold air rushing past his face, Wade\u2019s buzz fades pretty quickly. Damn, he hadn\u2019t realised how much he missed being able to get drunk until now.</p>\n<p>[What do you think are the chances that Valkyrie will share her intergalactic bootlegging source with us?]</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I do think I have some prime blackmail material on her and Loki on my phone now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s laughter carries back to him on the wind, and Wade squeezes tighter where his legs are locked around his hips. It\u2019s true they\u2019ve done this plenty of times before, when Wade was hurt, or they were in a hurry, or when he was just too lazy and whiny enough that Spidey carried him around just to shut him up. And still it gives him a heady rush of pleasure to be allowed.</p>\n<p>Travelling by the skyline, it\u2019s a quick trip back to Peter\u2019s place. Wade hadn\u2019t really noticed how convenient the terrace off his living room was until they land there. But then again, he missed a lot of the clues. Peter lets them in and walks over to the couch, where he dumps Wade off, then falls back against him, driving all the air from Wade\u2019s lungs.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re heavy for such a small dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>muscle</i>,\u201d Peter grumbles. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not small.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re kinda tiny, Spidey,\u201d Wade says, digging his fingers in the ticklish curve of Peter\u2019s ribs. </p>\n<p>Peter giggles and writhes away to settle on the sofa beside him. \u201cYou know, I was thinking about what Mister Stark said.\u201d</p>\n<p>[oh fuck]</p>\n<p>[[Well, we knew this was never going to last.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Wade swats around his head distractedly. \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sits up and takes his hand from midair, holding it in both of his own. \u201cAbout trusting you. And I wanted you to know, that\u2019s not why I didn\u2019t tell you sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade shrugs. \u201cHey, Spidey, you don\u2019t have to explain yourself to me. I wouldn\u2019t have told me, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo--listen, fuck those voices, and the Avengers, and whoever else told you that you weren\u2019t worth their trust. Wade you\u2019ve had my back since the day we met, when you could have totally taken advantage--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were adorably stoned.\" Wade smiles dreamily at the memory.</p>\n<p>Peter nods his head, smiling wearily. \u201cYeah, yeah, I was sixteen, okay? And you were a complete gentleman. My point is, I trusted you then, and now I trust you more than anyone. But...it was really nice, having this <i>one person</i> who didn\u2019t treat me like their little brother, who wasn\u2019t constantly treating me like a kid--you\u2019ve always treated me like an equal, and I don\u2019t know, I wanted to keep that for myself for a while. That and I was kind of worried once you saw I was younger, you wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with me anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade wants to protest, but they both know that it\u2019s at least partially true. If he\u2019d known just how young Spidey was that first night, he\u2019d probably have gone off the kill Stark right then and there for putting a kid in a suit and sending him to do an adult\u2019s job. </p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Fuck, I was hitting on a sixteen year old,\u201d Wade says dully.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee!\u201d Peter says. \u201cOh my god, please don\u2019t beat yourself up over it--you didn\u2019t know. But you see what I mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade tugs him closer, turning his hand to lace his fingers through Peter's. Peter comes so readily, climbing over Wade\u2019s lap and settling in with his legs splayed wide on either side of Wade\u2019s hips. And Wade does get it, because Peter is right. If he\u2019d known all along, they might never have gotten here.\n\"Ah, it was kinda fun though, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Wade holds up their joint hands to place a kiss on Peters knuckles. \u201cThe tease of not knowing what was under the mask?\u201d Peter\u2019s breath catches when Wade\u2019s tongue darts out to lick the delicate skin between his fingers. \u201cThough it\u2019s gonna be a lot more fun having our post-fight rooftop hangouts now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice is gratifyingly breathy.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Wade takes Peter\u2019s middle finger between his lips, giving it a nice, firm suck and scraping his teeth on the flesh as he pulls off. He\u2019s got a lovely little mental image of Spidey on his knees in full costume, mask rolled up just enough to reveal his lips, wrapped around Wade\u2019s dick. He pulls Peter in close, free hand splayed on his back, as he whispers just that into his ear.</p>\n<p>Peter actually trembles. His body does one of those sweet, sinful little undulations against Wade\u2019s, and he whispers back, \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t have to wait until the next time we patrol. I\u2019ve got the costume in my closet right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, the second Peter starts stripping out of Wade\u2019s Wolvie costume, baring all that perfect sculpted skin, any plans of having him cover up again go right out the window. Wade tackles him to the bed before Peter can even get the top all the way over his head, placing sucking kisses down his chest and the line of his stomach. Covers all the fading marks and bruises with new ones.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s laughter is muffled through the fabric. He twists beneath Wade and struggles to free himself, but all that stops when Wade drags down his pants and boxers all in one go. Then Peter just sort of rips himself free, which is probably hotter to Wade than it should be.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought--\u201d Peter\u2019s voice gives out when Wade goes down on him, head thumping back on the mattress. \u201cI thought I was supposed to be the one blowing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Now there\u2019s an idea\u2026]</p>\n<p>Wade straightens enough to tug down the zipper, shrug his arms free and push it down around his hips. He grabs Peter by the arms, manhandling him around. \u201cCome down here.\u201d It only takes a second for Peter to get the idea, putting his head at the foot of the bed, tipped back just right for Wade to fuck his face. It\u2019s a sinful sight, the dark of Peter\u2019s pupils swallowing up his eyes, bottom lip caught between his teeth, the way his hips twist and strain off the bed as if he\u2019s not even aware he\u2019s doing it.</p>\n<p>Peter reaches up to wrap one hand around Wade\u2019s cock and guides it to his mouth. Wade tries to savour the moment, he really fucking does. Wants to take it slow and commit every little second to memory. But Peter\u2019s perfect, pink lips part around the head of his cock, and Wade\u2019s eyes fall closed, mouth hung open on a moan. His body tremors with the effort not to thrust forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck, Spidey.\u201d Peter hums in answer, the vibration buzzing down Wade\u2019s cock. He sucks gently at the tip, pulls back to lave his tongue over the head, and then takes him in again, deeper. His free hand brushes up the outside of Wade\u2019s thigh, the tips of his fingers tracing the shape of scars. It\u2019s a delicate counterpoint to the pressure of his tongue on the underside of Wade\u2019s cock. Tender in a way that catches in Wade\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>He opens his eyes to see Peter looking up at him with an intensity that makes Wade\u2019s cock throb. Peter sucks the precum that pulses from Wade\u2019s cock and makes a satisfied sound. His hand comes to rest beneath the curve of Wade\u2019s ass, just enough force behind the touch to urge him deeper. It\u2019s a slow slide, and Wade keeps waiting for the second Peter starts to gag or pushes him away. Tears prick up at the corner of his eyes, but he makes no protest as he takes Wade all the way down. </p>\n<p>The sensation of Peter\u2019s throat fluttering desperately around the head of Wade\u2019s cock is quite possibly the single hottest thing he\u2019s ever experienced, and he lets himself indulge in it for several long seconds before pulling out altogether. He\u2019s slick with spit, a thick trail of it connecting Peter\u2019s mouth with Wade\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>Peter gasps for breath, his throat working around a series of aborted swallows, trails his tongue along the outline of his lips and lunges up to take Wade back in his mouth. \u201cJesus Christ, how are you for real?\u201d Wade moans, thrusting despite his best efforts. Both Peter\u2019s hands grab him by the ass, squeezing big handfuls, and urges him to meet the rhythm of his bobbing head.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only when Wade finally tears his eyes off Peter\u2019s face to trail down the length of his body that he remembers the whole point was sucking Peter off <i>while</i> getting sucked off. Peter\u2019s perfect cock is hard and curved up towards his stomach, glistening at the tip, just begging for Wade\u2019s mouth and Wade isn\u2019t about to deny him. He braces a knee on the mattress and his hands on either side of Peter\u2019s hips and bends over to suck him.</p>\n<p>Peter arches into him and Wade has to grab onto his hips and hold him down, just to feel the flex of his muscles straining against his palms. Fits his thumbs to the yellowed-skin bruises he left earlier and pushes down just enough for Peter to feel it.</p>\n<p>They both know Peter could easily buck off Wade\u2019s hold, but he doesn\u2019t. He makes himself still, trembling with the effort, and lets Wade control the pace and the depth, the same as Peter does with him. He keeps taking Wade deep, making those ridiculously hot sounds when he chokes himself on Wade\u2019s cock, and fuck he\u2019s not going to last long, between that, and the taste of Peter on his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cWade,\u201d Peter pants, pulling off to place tiny kisses down the length of him. \u201cI want your fingers.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Fucking minx,</i> it\u2019s like everything Peter says and does is designed to drive him crazy. Wade slicks up two fingers good and wet, pulls his asscheek back with the other hand and circles Peter\u2019s hole to feel it twitch. He dips his middle finger inside, just the tip and gives a little tug. Peter makes this sound, lets out a shuddering breath pressed against Wade\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking tease,\u201d he says, and nips at Wade\u2019s balls. Wade grins around his mouthful and pushes his index in alongside, sinks them in deep. Peter groans his appreciation and shows it by taking Wade back in his mouth. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for Peter to get close like that, fucking himself back on Wade\u2019s fingers and up into his mouth, whining when Wade crooks his fingers just right and deepthroats him. The closer he gets, the harder he goes at Wade, sucking him like he\u2019s getting him off. Like he wants to make Wade cum as much as he wants to cum himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Petey.\u201d Wade licks over the slit of his cock, really works his tongue against it to make Peter writhe. \u201cCome for me baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. You first,\u201d he breathes, and then one of his dexterous little fingers works its way between Wade\u2019s asscheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little--oh fuck, yeah, right there, Spidey.\u201d Peter keeps rubbing over that spot, and oh, the pressure\u2019s just right. The mouth on his cock is almost secondary to that. Shit the kid knows what he\u2019s doing. Wade\u2019s orgasm hits him like a fucking freight train. He blacks out for a goddamn second, face pressed between Spidey\u2019s damp thighs. Spidey\u2019s still sucking him, throat working as he swallows every last drop of Wade\u2019s cum. Not stopping even as Wade starts to go soft and is shuddering from the sensitivity. </p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s legs are threatening to give out on him altogether. \u201cBabe, ya gotta--\u201d Peter makes a questioning sound and Wade\u2019s ass clenches at the <i>too much</i>, but it\u2019s so good. Wade drags himself upright, stumbles backwards from the edge of the bed, cock hanging limp between his legs. Peter grins at him upside down, drags the back of his hand across his mouth. There\u2019s a glint of challenge in his eyes.</p>\n<p><i>And boy, are we ever up for a challenge</i>.</p>\n<p>[[You say up\u2026]]</p>\n<p>\n<i>Give it a minute.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Wade climbs up with him, lets Peter wind his arms around Wade\u2019s neck and drag him down for a kiss, lost in it for a minute. Kissing Pete is so good, the way his whole body gets into it. Straining up to meet Wade, leg twining around his hips to pull him down, fingers digging into Wade\u2019s scalp to hold him in place while Peter licks into his mouth. </p>\n<p>But he\u2019s still hard and leaking with it, cock nudging against Wade\u2019s skin with every movement of their bodies, and maybe Wade has a point to make. He disentangles himself from Spidey, and fuck is he living up to his name, nothing but limbs hanging on tight. Wade sinks down, grabs Peter behind the knees and slings them over his own shoulders, hauls Peter as close as he can get him with hands splaying his asscheeks open, and buries his face there.</p>\n<p>\u201cOH!\u201d Peter\u2019s hands scramble over Wade\u2019s head, nails scoring. \u201cOh shit, I--\u201d Wade licks across his hole, broad, flat swipes of his tongue, just to get Peter used to the sensation. \u201cWade, oh fuck, it\u2019s too much, I can\u2019t--oh!\u201d He actually squeals when Wade jabs at the opening with the tip of his tongue, clench and release, until Wade can thrust inside, and then it\u2019s just a litany of \u201cyes, yes, yes, yes, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter reaches down himself, hand fisted around his cock. His heels thump against Wade\u2019s back, then the soles of his feet press flat for leverage as he rocks down on Wade\u2019s tongue. \u201cRight there,\u201d Peter pants. \u201cLike that, oh please.\u201d His body is one tense line, toes curling into skin, fingers bruising Wade\u2019s skull, hips jerking reflexively. </p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s jaw is starting to ache and his tongue is cramping, but there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to stop, not when Peter\u2019s stopped breathing, hanging right there on the edge. And then in breaks over him, little jolts running up and down his body as he finally cums, almost silent except for the ragged breath he finally exhales. Wade keeps working his tongue until the last pulse of Peter\u2019s cock and then lets Peter\u2019s legs drop and collapses beside him, both their heads hanging off the end of the bed, catching their breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>A chuckle bubbles up from Wade\u2019s chest. He rolls onto his side to sling an arm and leg over Peter, cock tucked up against his hip. Peter gives him a sidelong look, brow raised. \u201cI thought I was the teenager here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade waggles his brows. \u201cHealing factor, babe. It has its benefits.\u201d He rocks his hips to drive the point home, so to speak.</p>\n<p>Peter rolls onto his side as well, strokes a hand along Wade\u2019s stomach. He looks up from under his lashes, and has no right to look so coy given all that\u2019s just transpired between them. \u201cSo you weren\u2019t kidding about that whole not getting out of bed for a month thing, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d Wade really pops the P.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s grin matches Wade\u2019s and he gets up on his knees, pushes Wade onto his back and climbs over to straddle him, hands roaming down Wade\u2019s chest. \u201cMmm, well, sign me the fuck up,\u201d he says, grinding his ass back on Wade\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>After their third go around, Peter tugs the comforter over them and curls up, little spoon to Wade\u2019s big, and is asleep in seconds. Wade\u2019s eyelids have weights attached, but he can\u2019t quite keep them closed long enough to sleep. Like if he drifts off, he\u2019s going to wake up somewhere else to find all of this had been nothing but the best dream ever.</p>\n<p>[[Maaaaaybe you finally managed to die for good.]]</p>\n<p>Which, okay, entirely possible this could be Wade\u2019s version of heaven. The only thing is, if he were ever to really die, they all know there\u2019s no chance he\u2019d end up here.</p>\n<p>Yellow starts singing \u201cHeaven is a Place on Earth\u201d in the background of Wade\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>[[Since we\u2019re up anyway, maybe now is a good time for us to discuss all the ways you could possibly fuck this up.]]</p>\n<p>Wade resolutely closes his eyes, jaw set, and wills himself to sleep.</p>\n<p>[[What, exactly, do you think that\u2019s going to achieve? I\u2019m <i>inside</i> your <i>head</i>.]]</p>\n<p>At that point Peter rolls back towards him, sleepy warm and soft. Wade grows aware of the fact that he\u2019s been humming along absently with Yellow and stops, holds his breath. Peter\u2019s hand comes up to cup Wade\u2019s cheek and he mumbles, \u201cTell your boxes to let you sleep, Wade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade is stupidly touched by the thought. He presses his smile into Peter\u2019s hair. \u201cBold of you to assume they listen to anything I say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet him sleep, guys,\u201d Peter mutters. \u201cDon\u2019t be dicks.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sort of stunned silence that follows in Wade\u2019s mind, and then a perturbed grumble from White, but after a moment he quiets down. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing Spidey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter makes a sound of agreement. \u201cThey wrote a song about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade chuckles and bundles Peter up close in his arms, hums the melody under his breath until Peter quiets him with a kiss. \u201cSleep, Wade,\u201d he says, and Wade does.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>True to his word, Wade keeps Peter in all day Saturday, venturing out of the bedroom only occasionally for a well-deserved shower or to pay the delivery guy, who gets an eyeful when Wade answers the door in a sheet. Peter is insatiable and without any sort of shame in bed, whether it\u2019s telling Wade exactly what he wants, fucking himself open on his fingers when Wade doesn\u2019t get to it fast enough, wanton moaning even through the blush that spreads from his cheeks down his neck...or letting himself be bent over the kitchen counter while Wade eats him out, thrusting back on his face, bouncing on Wade\u2019s dick like a fucking trampoline on the dining room chair, feet braced on the rungs for leverage.</p>\n<p>There are all sorts of amazing things about Spidey, let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s not just the physical shit. But Spidey really excels at the sexy shit. Super strength and endurance and healing on top of being nineteen years old. And the way he can <i>move</i>. He\u2019s so bendy in all the right ways, like when he\u2019s got his knees over Wade\u2019s shoulders, pressed all the way back against his chest and it leaves him so open for Wade to fuck him deep.</p>\n<p>Saturday rolls into Sunday, and Peter makes breakfast burritos. Which, okay, he had Wade at burritos, but they\u2019re fucking good, which he keeps moaning about around huge mouthfuls. Peter grins around his own overstuffed mouth. \u201cSurvival mechanism. Aunt May tried, but she truly is an awful cook. We mostly lived off takeout, which was way too expensive, so I picked up a thing or two. Besides, it\u2019s just science when you come down to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Oooh, have we finally earned the right to his back story?] </p>\n<p>Spider-Man hasn\u2019t talked a lot about his home life. Early in their relationship he was so guarded about any personal information and by the time he\u2019d warmed up to Wade, they\u2019d moved to a more casual exchange. Wade knows about his Aunt, but this is the first time he\u2019s gotten a name to go along with it, and he\u2019s never asked why Spidey was with her instead of his parents.</p>\n<p>Does Peter want him to ask about his Aunt? Is that even allowed. Wade sort of thinks Peter using the L word means he can probably ask about family, but Yellow and White are rather insistently against it. </p>\n<p>Thing is, Wade could have figured this stuff out for himself years ago. He could have known the face and the name within days after first meeting Spidey, but something about that first encounter left him inclined to respect his privacy. It had been a weird and uncomfortable sensation, given the general attitude of the Avengers towards him, to not learn everything he could about a potential enemy.</p>\n<p>[Don\u2019t pretend you weren\u2019t in love with him from the word go.]</p>\n<p>[[A fucking kid you perv.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, asshole,\u201d he grumbles under his breath. Then he freezes in mopping up the sauce that\u2019s spilled on the plate. He darts a concerned look at Peter, because maybe that sounded bad given the context, but Peter just kicks him in the shin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never bothered filtering yourself before,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t scared me off yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade laughs, and he knows it\u2019s a little off, but he can\u2019t control it. \u201cYeah, and as fucked up as the worst thing you\u2019ve ever heard me say might be, not even the tip of the iceberg, Petey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Peter swallows his bite and licks the sauce from his fingertips, and it\u2019s fucking distracting, but Wade makes himself focus. \u201cWhen Mister Stark first came to see me, he wanted to know why I was doing the whole hero thing. And I told him a--well, it wasn\u2019t a lie really, but it wasn\u2019t the truth, either. I mean, not the actual answer he wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has no idea where this is headed, but Wade wants to know, desperately. Truth like a dried up scab picked away, oozing painful secrets. Stark was Peter\u2019s doorway to this world of supeheroes, and even so this was a secret he\u2019d apparently never shared before now, even with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was fourteen when I got my powers, and I was so stupid. I didn\u2019t give a fuck about saving the world or hell, even being a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. I could climb the walls. I could lift a car over my head one-handed. I came up with the webbing just to see how high I could swing with it. When I put those first videos up on youtube, I had these delusions of making insane amounts of money off my stunts. I guess I figured the Avengers had the whole superhero thing pretty well taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head, something dark behind the humour on his face. He crosses his arms over his chest and leans back in his chair, like he can put some extra distance between himself and whatever it is he\u2019s remembering, and Wade knows that feeling all too intimately. He almost reaches out, almost tells Peter to stop telling the story, but Peter speaks first.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy uncle caught on really quickly. I was being so irresponsible, staying out late, missing school, sneaking out. He gave me this big lecture on owning my actions and taking responsibility, and how having certain abilities makes you obligated to use them to help other people, and I could not care any less, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, long story short\u2026\u201d Peter fidgets, leans his elbows on his knees, stares down at his feet. \u201cHe was shot, just a couple blocks from our place. I was supposed to have been with him. If I had--If I hadn\u2019t been so selfish and stubborn and only out for myself--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were fourteen,\u201d Wade grits out between his teeth. </p>\n<p>[[Focus on your breathing.]]</p>\n<p>[It probably wouldn\u2019t be the best start of your relationship if you ran off and dismembered Tony Stark]</p>\n<p>Because there\u2019s no way Stark didn\u2019t research Peter\u2019s background before recruiting him, and there\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t put two and two together about his uncle\u2019s death and Peter\u2019s sense of obligation, and instead of oh, say, getting him to a therapist, he gave him a superpowered suit and sent him off to fight fucking Captain America.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you realise what you<i> could</i> have done? What you\u2019re really capable of? If I\u2019d had the powers I do now when I was your age, I mighta gone full darkside. Fuck knows my special forces body count would have easily doubled, not to mention the jobs I would have taken, after. But you--a kid with superpowers, and your worst crimes were truancy and extreme base jumping and being a hormonal teenager? \u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head with a rueful chuckle. \u201cYeah, well, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m responsible. I knew I was being an asshole, and I didn\u2019t care. I knew how to be a better person. My parents, my aunt and uncle, they raised me to be a good person, and I made a choice not to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am almost positive that wouldn\u2019t be held against you in a court of law,\u201d Wade insists. \u201cBeing a dick doesn\u2019t mean your his death was your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201c<i>Anyway</i>,\u201d Peter goes on. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is I try <i>so hard</i> to be the best person I can be, to help people, because I know it\u2019s the right thing to do, but what it really comes down to is I like how it feels to be special. I like how it feels to save people and know I\u2019m making a difference. My motivations aren\u2019t always noble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll find that most of your Avenger friends have similar motivations,\u201d Wade says, and he\u2019s not bitter, okay?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying,\u201d Peter drawls, slipping from his chair into Wade\u2019s lap and winding his arms around his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s fucked up. And I just talk to my suit instead of the voices in my head. Most of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>[That\u2019s goddamn adorable.]</p>\n<p>[[Aww look at the itsy bitsy spider trying to play like he\u2019s a badass]]</p>\n<p>Wade can only presume his eyes are actual hearts right now, if the growing expression of annoyance on Peter\u2019s face is anything to go by. Wade reigns it in, makes himself focus on the important part of what Peter said. \u201cSo, uh, what happened with your mom and dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlane crash. I was really little, I don\u2019t remember them much. My Aunt and Uncle pretty much raised me even before they died--they were gone all the time.\u201d He\u2019s clearly trying to play it like it\u2019s not as big a deal as it actually is, so Wade lets him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a proper origin story \u2018til you\u2019ve racked up the body count.\u201d It\u2019s kind of a horrible thing to say. He knows it, and has the time to stop the words before they cross his lips, but Peter knows him, has been around him at some of his lowest points, and he\u2019s not only still around, but now letting Wade touch him in his private places, so...</p>\n<p>And sure enough Peter just rolls his eyes and says, \u201cYou would know.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Okay, but maybe try not to actively push him away yeah???]]</p>\n<p>They spend the afternoon snuggling on the couch with a Lord of the Rings marathon, arguing over who is the hottest of the fellowship, until Liv Tyler shows up and they can both agree on that anyway. Then cuddling turns into making out, and then it\u2019s only a matter of time before they\u2019re grinding against each other like two kids getting off for the first time.</p>\n<p>Wade keeps waiting for Peter to shoo him off so he can do his school work or maybe patrol, or maybe for the simple fact that they\u2019ve basically been dating all of two days and they\u2019re not lesbians, so they\u2019re not at the moving in together stage of things. But Sunday night becomes Monday morning, and Peter shows no sign of discontent, or any intention of asking Wade to leave. </p>\n<p>Wade blinks awake sometime in mid-morning, and it\u2019s a novel sensation these days, waking up without the voices reminding him of all the ways he\u2019s a failure, and nothing but the sound of Al\u2019s slippers shuffling on wooden floorboards to distract him from the crushing weight of loneliness.</p>\n<p>Peter rolls towards him when he moves, snuggling up close and weighing the pros of chocolate chip pancakes against the cons of actually getting out of bed to make them, between lazy morning-breath kisses. He reaches past Wade for the lube on the nightstand and pushes down the sheets enough to reach his goal, slicks Wade up and straddles him, sinking down in one smooth motion. Wade just holds on, admiring the way his hands look splayed on Peter\u2019s narrow hips,</p>\n<p>After, with Peter curled up against his side panting, Wade has to ask. \u201cDon\u2019t you have school or some shit? Or your internship. Wait. Is being a hero your internship?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, yes, but I do other stuff, too. Mostly working on my own projects--it\u2019s a lot easier when Mister Stark is footing the bill. As for class\u2026\u201d He sits up to squint at the bedside clock, then flops back down. \u201cMissed a couple, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at you, you fucking rebel, I always took you as too much of a goody two shoes to go skipping school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou promised me a month of uninterrupted sex, and I might be a nerd, but I know how to prioritise.\u201d He gets up from bed, taking Wade by the hands to pull him to his feet. \u201cSo, pancakes first, shower sex after.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade crowds him against the door frame, sucking marks onto his throat. \u201cOh baby, talk dirty to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplosive ordnance, Bea Arthur, chimichangas,\u201d Peter says, around those impossibly sexy, breathy moans of his when Wade bites down on the curve of his neck. \u201cBernadette Peter\u2019s Playboy shoot.\u201d Wade drops to his knees and Peter draws in a sharp breath. \u201cOkay, blowjobs, <i>then</i> pancakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade finally puts down his foot late Tuesday morning when they\u2019re woken by the ringing of Peter\u2019s phone. They\u2019re lying close enough together and it\u2019s quiet enough that Wade can hear the woman on the other end, who sounds remarkably non-emotive given the content of her words. \u201cDude, where the hell have you been? You\u2019re not answering your texts, Gwen said you skipped out of class yesterday. Ned is losing his shit. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve just been a little distracted,\u201d Peter mumbles around a yawn. \u201cI meant to text him back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you\u2019d let anything distract you from going to class, you nerd, unless you...holy shit, Parker, did you finally climb on that dick?\u201d She sounds like she\u2019s talking around a mouthful of cereal.</p>\n<p>Peter flings an arm over his eyes as Wade shakes in silent laughter. \u201cJesus, MJ, tact, look it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. And I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want, <i>Michelle</i>?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust calling to remind you about Harry\u2019s tonight. Maybe wash off the sex stank first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you probably shouldn\u2019t skip again or Gwen\u2019s going to show up at your front door to lecture you on your ten year plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye MJ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Wade comments, after Peter has jabbed the end call button with more force than strictly necessary, and tossed the phone aside. \u201cShe sounds absolutely charming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s going to love you, too.\u201d Peter sounds unreasonably forlorn about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Wade springs up onto his knees with a clap of his hands. \u201cUp and at \u2018em, kiddo. Gotta burn those bunsens and table those elements. Bedazzle some DNA. Do science!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter grumbles a lot along the way, but Wade finally manages to get them showered and dressed and out the front door. They grab peppery coffee at the place around the corner, and Peter buys them red bean stuffed taiyaki from a street vendor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making me go to class when you could have me in bed,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I am frankly astonished at your underestimation of Tony Stark\u2019s obsessive compulsive surveillance habits. Seriously, he could put The Police to shame. And I think if you were to miss much more school he\u2019d show up to whisk me away to some S.H.I.E.L.D. black site.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you so eloquently pointed out at the party, Tony Stark isn\u2019t actually my father,\u201d Peter says, but then his shoulders sag and he adds. \u201cBut, yeah. You\u2019re probably right. Though he wouldn\u2019t show up himself, he\u2019d just send Happy to lecture me.\u201d After a second, he punches Wade lightly on the arm. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got that song stuck in my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade walks with him to the subway, and Peter sidles up to him while they\u2019re waiting on the train, toe to toe, leaning into Wade\u2019s space. \u201cSo, I\u2019m supposed to do this movie night with friends tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Wade agrees.</p>\n<p>Peter tugs at the ends of the strings of the hoodie Wade has borrowed from him, and goes up on his toes to brush a quick kiss over his mouth. \u201cWanna come with?\u201d</p>\n<p>After several seconds of Peter\u2019s expectant, upturned face, it sinks in. \u201cOh. You\u2019re being serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Wade</i>.\u201d Even his frustration is adorable. \u201cAs you may have gathered from MJ, I ah, might have gone on about you. At length. Especially once I finally made a move and you shot me down.\u201d His face falls. \u201cI was really fucked up over that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Sp--etey, I\u2019m so fucking sorry about that. I didn\u2019t mean to jerk you around. I coulda just blown my brains out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, no.\u201d Peter strokes a hand down his cheek. \u201cI prefer them intact. Even if you\u2019d grow them back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you want me to come hang out with your friends who\u2019ve heard you telling them what an asshole I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter huffs in annoyance. \u201cYou are an asshole, but that\u2019s not what I told them. I mostly blubbered about how I\u2019d somehow mistaken all the flirting, and also speculated about who you were actually in love with. I had it narrowed down to Matt Murdock and Cable.\u201d</p>\n<p>[I\u2019d have said Wolvie and Cable.]</p>\n<p>[[Please, are we just going to ignore his burning thirst for Colossus dick?]]</p>\n<p>Wade nods at all of them. \u201cFair enough. The thing is babe, most civilians aren\u2019t down to chill with Deadpool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m not going to badger you into it.\u201d Peter releases his hoodie as the train rumbles down the tunnel. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t wanna come, then you shouldn\u2019t. But I hope it\u2019s not because you they won\u2019t like you, because they will.\u201d </p>\n<p>The train pulls up, screeching as it halts, and Peter gives him one last kiss before turning away. \u201cI\u2019ll text you the info if you change your mind,\u201d he calls over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you,\u201d Wade calls out, belatedly, just as the doors are starting to close, and Peter\u2019s whole posture changes--spine straight, shoulders back, face lighting up like a Christmas tree. He mouths the words back through the closed doors, and waves as the train pulls away.</p>\n<p>The dilemma over whether or not to attend movie night isn\u2019t helped by Peter\u2019s text, when it becomes obvious from the address that the Harry in question is Harry fucking Osborne, which aside from being a whole messy can of worms that he\u2019s going to have to ask Pete about, just feels weird? He can just see himself striding into Osborne\u2019s posh penthouse, surrounded by beautiful teenagers, looking like he do. Probably shouldn\u2019t wear the suit for a night in, but that means leaving his face bare to their scrutiny. All the questioning looks over why Peter wouldn\u2019t have chosen him--and is it weirder for him to be dating Deadpool if they know he\u2019s Spider-Man, or if they don\u2019t?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fucking providence then, that when he lets himself into his place, it\u2019s to find Cable sitting alongside Al on the sofa, sipping tea and listening to an old George Burns routine.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking finally,\u201d Cable growls. \u201cWhat is the point of that shitty flip phone you insist on keeping, if you never answer it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a bit busy. Balls deep in Spider-Man, if you must know,\u201d Wade answers, with great dignity.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't,\" Al mutters.</p>\n<p>Cable\u2019s brows climb to his hairline. \u201cHave you completely lost the ability to distinguish between fantasy and the real world?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade flips him off. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is how he\u2019s given a suspiciously convenient out for the movie night. He sends Peter an apologetic text, and a selfie with his cheek pressed closed to an unamused-looking and possibly homicidal Cable, with Domino visible in the background only as a pair of bunny ears behind each of their heads. </p>\n<p>Peter responds with increasingly explicit descriptions of what he\u2019d rather be doing with Wade over the next several days, complete with some artfully shot pornographic photos, escalating to full on sexting in the back of Dopinder\u2019s taxi. If anyone notices they\u2019re probably not surprised at this point.</p>\n<p>When they get back in the wee hours of Saturday morning, Wade has Dopinder drop him off at Peter\u2019s. It\u2019s almost two, but it\u2019s the weekend, and Petey keeps fucked up hours anyway, so when he doesn\u2019t answer to Wade\u2019s knock or text, it\u2019s safe to assume he\u2019s still out on patrol.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long to find him. Spidey will stray from his neighbourhood as required, but most of the time he sticks fairly close to home, keeping an eye on things. Tonight Deadpool finds him outside a townhouse with a bunch of drunk college girls who are climbing out of the silver Prius that Spidey pulled up to the curb. Wade crouches on top of the bodega across the street to watch.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s maybe remember to take the subway next time,\u201d Spidey is saying, over their giggling and chatter. \u201cLike, why did your parents even let you take a car with you to college? The cost of parking alone, how is it even worth it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The girls move like a pack of wolves, circling Spidey. One of them wraps an arm around his waist and another other around his shoulder, and a third snuggles up against his front poking at his mask. \u201cThat voice thingie sounds kinda hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to mention that ass, umph.\u201d One of them palms said ass, and Wade can\u2019t help cackling in glee.</p>\n<p>Spidey\u2019s head jerks up, eyes of his mask narrowing when they land on Wade. \u201cA little help here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve got this one covered babe,\u201d Wade calls back, hands cupped around his mouth.</p>\n<p>This gets the girls\u2019 attention. The one still kneading Peter\u2019s ass sizes Deadpool up as best she can from the distance and says, \u201cOoh, you can invite your friend along, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey does this little sideways wiggle dance and disentangles himself from them, then shoots a web and flips up onto a streetlamp to dodge their grabbing hands. \u201cNo more trying to drive drunk,\u201d he says sternly, then flings the keys towards the building and webs them to a window ledge on the second floor. \u201cYou can get those tomorrow when you\u2019ve sobered up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade gives him a golf clap, and then Peter is swinging across to land beside him, grabs Wade around the waist with one arm and lifts the edge of his mask with the other, and Wade has just enough time to roll up his own mask before their mouths are crashing together. Down below the girls start cheering and screaming lewd suggestions. Wade takes Peter by both asscheeks and squeezes, which just makes them squeal louder.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Peter pulls away with a moan. His grip on Wade tightens, and he mutters, \u201chold on,\u201d which is all the warning Wade gets before he swings them off, to the chorus of disappointed groans of their audience. </p>\n<p>A few minutes later, they come to land on a much taller building, with no prying eyes, and Peter backs Wade up against the door of the roof access. </p>\n<p>\u201cI seem to recall a fantasy of yours starting something like this?\u201d Peter hums against his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much all the fantasies, Spidey. Every fantasy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter grins. \u201cWell then we should probably get started if we wanna hit them all.\u201d With that he sinks to his knees on the rooftop. Nuzzles the exposed part of his face over the bulge of Wade\u2019s suit, and it\u2019s not like he can feel much of it through the material, but the sight alone is so goddamn hot--Spidey\u2019s mask eyes narrowed to little slits, and just that one small strip of exposed skin from nose to chin with the rest of him still covered in red and blue--Wade\u2019s dick twitches and leaks within its confines.</p>\n<p>The buckle comes off first, and then Peter\u2019s nimble fingers find the hidden fly and drag down the zipper. Probably it shouldn\u2019t be so arousing, the texture of Spidey\u2019s gloves, the silky smooth of spandex and nanofibers cut through by the ridges of web, sliding over Wade\u2019s dick, pulling to free. Peter goes straight to town. Lips wrapped tight around him, cheeks hollowed out making a tight, wet tunnel of suction, while his tongue presses to the sensitive spot just beneath the head of his cock, dragging back and forth over the ridges there.</p>\n<p>Wade spreads his legs, sinks down a little further, rocks his hips to push a little deeper. Peter\u2019s hand rests on the inside of his thigh, and he pushes just enough to hold Wade in place and stop his squirming. Then he rewards Wade\u2019s stillness by going down to the root and just holding him there for a second, before pulling off altogether to place little kitten kisses up and down the length of his cock. Pursed lips against his frenulum, sucking just slightly, then down to lick and suck at his balls. Wade\u2019s head falls back against the door with a thunk.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Spider-Man,\u201d he moans, a little showy, when Peter takes his cock in his mouth again. His hand wiggles inside Wade\u2019s suit to cup his balls, while his fingers brush teasingly over the delicate skin behind. \u201cGonna have your way with me?\u201d Peter\u2019s fingers move with new purpose at the words, sliding further to prod between Wade\u2019s cheeks. Wade\u2019s cock hits the back of his throat and Peter keeps going. Wade\u2019s eyes fall closed at the duel sensation. \u201cGonna show the bad ole Merc who\u2019s boss, with your dick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat what you want, Pool?\u201d Peter asks. Shit, he sounds wrecked already, voice hoarse from Wade\u2019s dick down his throat. Two fingers push at Wade\u2019s hole, but not with enough pressure. Wade tries to push down, and Spidey pulls his hand free of the suit. He stands, chest leaning into Wade\u2019s, mouth on Wade\u2019s jaw, biting rough, sucking hard enough to bruise. His hands fumble between them at the pockets of Wade\u2019s suit. \u201cWant me to punish you for all the shit you\u2019ve done? All the times you fucked up a mission, crashed a job, caused more problems than you solved charging in with blades flying?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade lets out a shuddering breath and nods. He likes the way it feels, his adam\u2019s apple bobbing, the pressure of it against the cut of Peter\u2019s teeth on his throat as he swallows hard. \u201cYeah.\u201d Peter\u2019s lips curve into a grin. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>The show of strength is really doing it for Wade, the way Spidey grabs him by the arms and pins them over his head while they kiss, hands like steel bands on his wrists. Wade flexes his muscles just to see, and there\u2019s not the slightest give, but Peter doesn\u2019t even have to <i>try</i>. A shudder goes down his spine, hot and electric.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to take out every ounce of frustration on your ass?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Spidey, you\u2019re killing me here,\u201d Wade whines.</p>\n<p>Spidey switches his grip, bringing both wrists together to hold them with one hand. \u201cWhich of these fucking pockets has the lube, and don\u2019t you dare play dumb like we both don\u2019t know you carry it on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade jerks his chin vaguely in the direction of his right leg. \u201cSnap pouch, on my thigh.\u201d Peter kisses him hard, teeth clacking together from the force, while his hand finally finds its goal. As soon as his fingers close around the little tube, he steps back, releasing Wade, and pressing the spider on the front of his suit, which sags, suddenly slack, and falls loose around his shoulders, then down to pool at his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, ah, always go commando under your suit?\u201d Wade asks, because, well, he\u2019s dreamed, but never really imagined it was true.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m hoping my boyfriend\u2019s back in town after ditching me for five days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll make it up to you, baby boy.\u201d Wade scrambles to get undressed himself, getting all tangled up in his straps and holsters, and he doesn\u2019t even have the suit down to his knees before Spidey spins him around face first into the wall. Now bare fingers down Wade\u2019s back, mouth on his shoulder blade. The other hand slick on his ass, smearing lube over his hole, dipping briefly inside. Spidey lets out a groan, followed by the unmistakable sound of a lube coated hand stroking a dick. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s all the warning Wade gets, before Peter\u2019s lining up and pushing in. It\u2019s been a while, but Wade\u2019s body remembers what to do, relaxing into the rolling thrusts of Peter\u2019s hips to drive him deeper and deeper, until he\u2019s in to the hilt. Then he just rests there, spandex-covered forehead to Wade\u2019s back as he takes a steadying breath. Wade\u2019s dick is a fucking fountain of precum. Even the slightest twitch of Peter\u2019s cock inside him making it leak all the more.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Wade, you--\u201d Peter\u2019s words die on a choked moan when Wade contracts his muscles, making them clamp down on the base of his cock. \u201cThat\u2019s so--you\u2019re so--\u201d He never finishes the thought, just springs into motion. Hands clamped on Wade\u2019s hips, knees between his thighs spreading him wider, and then he\u2019s fucking <i>drilling</i> Wade\u2019s ass. As with everything else he does, Peter is good at this, too. All that super stamina, probably, lets him keep thrusting in that rough, punishing way that hits all the right places.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing Wade can do but twist and moan and fist his own cock desperately in time with the brutal pace Peter has set. He\u2019s so wet from leaking and close to cumming within a handful of minutes, and that\u2019s so out of character for him, but then again, Peter has that kind of effect, like any semblance of self-control or dignity out the window.</p>\n<p>[[What self-control?]]</p>\n<p>[WHAT DIGNITY???]</p>\n<p>Wade kind of proves their points by whining like a whore for Spidey to fuck him harder, moaning about how close he is, how he wants it so bad. Spidey answers by wrapping his fingers around Wade\u2019s on his cock. His pace slows, but he fucks in harder, <i>deeper</i> somehow, barely drawing back before shoving in again, tucked up tight against Wade\u2019s ass. </p>\n<p>Wade turns his head over his shoulder for a kiss, and Peter seems to get it right away, arching up to meet him. It brings it all back home, seeing the mask still covering half his face, that this is Spidey doing this, fucking so hard he\u2019s going to be limping the rest of the night, healing factor notwithstanding. Spider-Man, taking him right out in the open, for any of Stark or Fury\u2019s surveillance to see, for any civilian with an open window to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d he moans, \u201cI\u2019m gonna cum.\u201d He can feel it in the clench of his muscles, the radiating heat caught up between the feel of Spidey splitting him open and their hands on his cock. He\u2019s too far gone now.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you\u2019re already so wet,\u201d Spidey pants out against his mouth. He works his fingers between Wade\u2019s to rub over the head of his cock, then just beneath, thumb sweeping back and forth. \u201cIt feels so good when you fuck me, Wade, I wanna make you feel it, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade opens his mouth to say something, but all that comes out is a series of obscene groans, lips against the metal of the door, as his body jerks with the force of his orgasm. Behind him Peter makes a surprised sound, and his hips start thrusting erratically, barely able to move with how tight Wade\u2019s holding onto his dick. </p>\n<p>And shit, it\u2019s so hot, the way Peter fills him up so much he can feel it leaking out, how it\u2019s going to drip all inside his suit and he\u2019s never going to be able to wear it again without thinking of this very moment. It\u2019s all Wade can think of, shooting jizz all over the door and the front of himself, and it\u2019s unrepentantly dirty, and Peter is into it as he is. Those last little jerks of his hips as he empties every drop of cum in Wade\u2019s ass are on the edge of <i>too much</i>, but Wade rides it out with a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Peter says, when he\u2019s caught his breath and pulled out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we did that right here, oh my god. I don\u2019t even--I never would have--you make me do the dirtiest shit.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Wade says, still breathless himself. He turns to lean against the wall facing Pete. \u201cI think it\u2019s more like you know you can do every kinky thing you\u2019ve always wanted, and know I\u2019m not going to judge you for it. I\u2019m going to <i>let you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s blushing, but he\u2019s not denying it. \u201cAnd,\u201d Wade continues, stroking a single finger down the line of definition on Peter\u2019s abs. \u201cYou know you\u2019re going to let me do even dirtier, kinkier shit to you, and you\u2019re going to love every fucking second of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter breathes in agreement, closing the distance between them with a kiss. \u201cSo, uh, let\u2019s go home and do those things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, most people don\u2019t really think of me as the take home to meet your parents type,\u201d Wade says, as he\u2019s picking himself up off the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not most people.\u201d Spidey flings a web at one robber who\u2019s trying to run away, hitting his ankle and yanking him off his feet. \u201cAnd my parents are dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know--\u201d A gunshot rings out, and Wade registers the impact of three bullets in centre mass. </p>\n<p>[That fucking stings. Every. Goddamn. Time.]</p>\n<p>[[Rip his head off!]]</p>\n<p>Wade sighs in annoyance and grabs the gun from the guys hand, breaks his wrist for good measure, pulls his arm out of socket with the twisting of it, throws him to the ground where he groans in pain. White\u2019s suggestion is tempting, but he settles for a kick to the face instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I meant--and no fair trying to use the sympathy card.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey dodges a punch and webs a gun from another of the robbers, comes up swinging from a new web to one of the bank buttresses to land in front of a guy charging at Wade. \u201cLook, Deadpool, if you don\u2019t want to spend Christmas with me--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Wade protests, struggling with yet another of these robbers. Seriously, is there a clown car they\u2019re pouring out of somewhere?</p>\n<p>[[Just break his neck.]]</p>\n<p>[I don\u2019t think adding to the body count is going to make things with Spidey <i>better</i>.]</p>\n<p>Wade grits his teeth in frustration and just runs the guy head first into the wall, knocking him out. \u201cYou know I love you babe, but your aunt--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you guys for fucking serious?\u201d a robber asks them breathlessly.</p>\n<p>Wade faces him with hands on his hips. \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry, are we offending your delicate homophobic sensibilities?\u201d</p>\n<p>The guy gives him a strange look. \u201cI was talking more about the venue you\u2019ve chosen, to air your grievances.\u201d</p>\n<p>[I\u2019ve changed our mind. Kill <i>him</i>. A lot.]</p>\n<p>\u201cMind your own goddamn business,\u201d Spidey yells over, from where he\u2019s webbing two of the guys together.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was, before you two busted in here with your little domestic drama.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade punches him and his nose gives a satisfying crunch before he crumples to the ground, unconscious. \u201cSpidey,\u201d he says, aiming for conciliatory. \u201cI don\u2019t think I need to remind you how things went over with your Dad--\"\n</p>\n<p>[Lead balloon would be putting it too mildly.]</p>\n<p>\"For the last time, please stop calling him that.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to mention Gw--your beautiful blonde nerd friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Better watch out for that one, in case she tries to steal Petey away.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Spidey swings himself over to the last two guys, who have been silently loading their duffle bags full of cash, like they could somehow slip under the radar. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a problem with you. And frankly--\u201d he absorbs the punch of one robber and ducks under the spray of machine gun fire from the other, \u201cmy aunt might disagree with Iron Man\u2019s opinion of you just on principle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like the sound of this woman more and more the more you tell me about her,\u201d Wade says, watching with admiration as Peter begins to weave his webs around the remaining two, bouncing off the narrow walls of the vault back and forth, until they\u2019re trapped.</p>\n<p>Finally, Peter swings back over the land lightly on the ground before Wade, the expressive eyes of his mask wide and vulnerable. \u201cThen why are you fighting me so hard on this?\u201d He crosses his arms defensively over his chest, shifts his weight around, the very picture of uncertainty. \u201cShe\u2019s going to love you. Why won\u2019t you just trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>How can Wade put it into words without sounding super self-deprecating, which Peter never appreciates? He still can\u2019t figure why Peter chose him, cause Stark and Gwen and all the others are right--Peter <i>is</i> way too good for him. Not just the whole superhero side of things, but he\u2019s an actual fucking genius who\u2019s going to change the world. He\u2019s probably going to cure diseases and help people regrow limbs and end hunger and fix global warming and--</p>\n<p>Point is anyone with half a brain can see Wade doesn\u2019t deserve Peter, and anyone who cares about Peter is going to be rightfully upset over that fact, and Aunt May is the person who cares for him the most.</p>\n<p>[Other than us!]</p>\n<p>[[<i>Nobody</i> loves Spidey like us.]]</p>\n<p>Which is absolutely true, and is also why there\u2019s no point in resisting anymore, because they all know he\u2019s going to give in in the end. \u201cOkay. Okay! You\u2019re right. I mean, what\u2019s Christmas without disappointing your family with your choice of romantic partners, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man manages to convey an eyeroll very eloquently given that Wade can\u2019t actually see his eyes. \u201cExactly.\u201d He leans forward and presses his lips to Wade\u2019s cheek. With both of them still wearing their masks, it barely registers as anything more than pressure.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll take care of these guys while you go get cleaned up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which is how Wade finds himself outside a cute little pre-war walkup next to the Q train line holding a tray of steak and cheddar chimichangas.</p>\n<p>[We look like a tool.]</p>\n<p>Wade doesn't disagree, but it\u2019s not like he could show up at Peter\u2019s aunt\u2019s in full Deadpool regalia. Besides the ridiculous black slacks and jacket over his white button-down and appropriately festive green and red striped tie, he\u2019s also almost completely unarmed.</p>\n<p>[[Might as well be naked.]]</p>\n<p>Aunt May lives on the second floor, and when he knocks there\u2019s a flurry of movement from within. Wade has to fight the urge to just throw the tray and bolt out the window when he hears the sound of the lock turning. Peter\u2019s face greets him, split into a huge grin at the sight of Wade. Wade holds out the trays. \u201cBrought chimis,\u201d he says weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Peter says. He takes the tray and pitches his voice in a whisper just for Wade. \u201cMay got it in her head she was going to make duck, so now we\u2019ll actually have something edible on the table.\u201d </p>\n<p>As he steps back to let Wade in, his brow furrows. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not digging the look, but you didn\u2019t have to get all dressed up.\u201d Peter himself is wearing a black t-shirt with a Christmas tree outline that is actually lit up in a rainbow of LED lights, and lusekofte printed pajama pants. \u201cHang on!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter dashes out of the room, and Wade is left to take it all in. Cosy and cramped, but neat. Lots of small, comfortable overstuffed chairs covered in pillows and knitted throws. Leafy green plants all over the place, tucked in around the bookshelf and end table and tv stand, alongside photos of Peter throughout his childhood, often with one of two sets of very attractive adults.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s bent over one particularly adorable photo of Peter at maybe age eight or so, dressed up in an Iron Man costume with the mask lifted up to reveal a gap-toothed smile. Behind him, someone clears their throat, and Wade turns to face one of the women from the photos, who barely looks as though she\u2019s aged. Aunt May, with a cascade of shining golden brown hair tumbling down around her face, wearing a red tank top covered in snowflakes and reading \u201cI\u2019m dreaming of a wine Christmas,\u201d that shows off her toned arms.</p>\n<p>[AILF material, holy shit!]</p>\n<p> \u201cWade!\u201d she says, smiling cautiously. There\u2019s none of the flinching he\u2019s used to at the sight of his face. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to finally meet you, after I\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou---don\u2019t look at all how I imagined,\u201d Wade finally says.</p>\n<p>May shakes her head. It\u2019s weird how much she looks like Peter when she rolls her eyes, given they\u2019re not actually biologically related. \u201cYeah, I get that a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter comes skidding back into the room in his socks, holding a fistful of truly horrifying holiday sweater, which he hands over to Wade. \u201cNow you\u2019ll fit right in.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[Somehow I doubt that.]]</p>\n<p>Still, Wade lets Peter lead him off to a bedroom that must have been his, still done up as he left it when he moved out on his own. Wade takes in the action figures on the wall, Star Wars model ships, a half-finished game of chess left forgotten. Wade still hasn\u2019t quite come to terms with the fact that this is where Peter lived when they first met. The desk where he rushed through his homework so he could go on patrol. This is the place he returned after every fight\u2026</p>\n<p>Like the time with Doc Oc on the roof of his building and Wade only just managed to arrive in time to break Spidey\u2019s fall when he\u2019d run out of web fluid. Cracked ribs, internal bleeding, and Spider-Man had just made Wade wrap his chest then jumped right back in the fray before he\u2019d healed.</p>\n<p>And after, bloody and battered, that\u2019s the window he climbed through. That\u2019s the bunk bed he crawled into and passed out, surrounded by the trappings of his childhood, and Wade had just let him go. It made his chest ache to think of it. </p>\n<p><i>Never again.</i> Peter would never be left alone again after one of his fights. If there was ever a time to be thankful for the curse of his immortality, it's knowing he\u2019ll be around to keep Peter safe.</p>\n<p>When he reemerges in his Christmas sweater (Santa riding a unicorn through space, shooting stardust out its butt) he\u2019s greeted with Peter presenting him a glass of wine. May\u2019s smile is sad, but genuine, when she gives Wade a once over. \u201cThat was one of Ben\u2019s favourites,\u201d she says, then she gives him a wry look. \u201cIt looks good on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Wade agrees. \u201cI know this mug just screams male model.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope Peter warned you that we don\u2019t do an exactly...traditional Christmas here in the Parker household.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit, well I guess I should probably just leave.\u201d Peter yanks him back down on the couch from where he tries to rise. Wade cracks a smile. \u201cBut seriously, Christmas in the Wilson household tended to involved a lot of verbal abuse and unbearable silences and both parents either storming out or getting shitfaced, so...yay for breaking that tradition.\u201d He gives May a double thumbs up and waits for Peter\u2019s embarrassment or censure, but Peter just hugs his arm and lays his head on Wade\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter will attest that I can\u2019t leave a silence alone, and the screaming only starts after the third hour of Monopoly.\u201d May shrugs and gives him a double thumbs up in return. \u201cI guess we\u2019re 2/3rds the way there.\u201d</p>\n<p>They each nominate a non-Christmas Christmas film to watch--Peter picks Trading Places, May Edward Scissorhands, and Wade The Long Kiss Goodnight. They pull them out of a hat and settle in for Peter\u2019s choice first. It\u2019s comfortable, the way they\u2019ve both clearly seen it so many times they know it by heart and they have no qualms about quoting along with the film or making jokes the entire time.</p>\n<p>Near the end, Aunt May starts cursing and running into the kitchen, exclaiming something about how she forgot to set a timer. Wade and Peter follow to find her staring in dismay at the duck. \u201cHow is burnt and raw at the same time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, May, Wade brought chimichangas. I\u2019ll make some guacamole.\u201d</p>\n<p>May breaks out the tequila, and what she lacks in the cooking department, she makes up for with her Margaritas. They watch The Long Kiss Goodnight over dinner, and then break out the board games. They\u2019re both horrible cheaters, but they\u2019re both so adorable about it that Wade can\u2019t even bring himself to be annoyed. After about an hour, Peter does his Spidey thing, where he sits up straight, eyes going far away.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d May says, with her voice tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing big,\u201d Peter says, already standing up. \u201cTen minutes. Sounds like someone taking advantage of empty apartments on the next block.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant some help?\u201d Wade asks, looking between him and May with uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Peter waves him off, halfway down the hall. \u201cYou don\u2019t have your suit--I keep an extra here just in case. Ten minutes, fifteen max.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a brief silence in his wake, before May laughs nervously. \u201cTold you I can\u2019t do silences,\u201d she says after a few seconds. \u201cSo.\u201d She claps her hands together. \u201cTell me about yourself, Wade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Aside what you\u2019ve no doubt seen on the news?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually I tend to avoid anything to do with the superheroes or mutants.\u201d May takes a long gulp of her margarita. \u201cIt just makes me anxious, seeing all the things that are a part of Peter\u2019s world, all the ways he could be hurt. But Peter\u2019s told me about you two working together. About you keeping him safe.\u201d She reaches across the table to lay a hand over his. \u201cThank you for taking care of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is not the usual reaction people have about me hanging around Spidey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess?\u201d May asks dryly. \u201cTony Stark? He\u2019s the one getting Peter into trouble to begin with half the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to disagree with you there,\u201d Wade says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got this feeling that if you had the full picture of my whole mercenary background, you might not be so keen on me hanging around.\u201d</p>\n<p>May takes a deep breath, holds it a moment, then lets it out on a long sigh. Her gaze is fixed on something over Wade\u2019s shoulder; he thinks he remembers a photograph there, of Peter with his parents. \u201cI\u2019m not keen on a lot of what Peter does. He\u2019s brilliant--just like his parents. Just like Ben, so full of potential. And I worry constantly that he\u2019s going to end up dead way too young, just like them. If it were up to me, he\u2019d never have gotten mixed up in this Avengers business to begin with. Never put on that stupid costume again.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Mmm, I\u2019d be fine with that, too.]</p>\n<p>Wade has to tune out the stream of truly filthy things White is suggesting they do with a naked Spidey, because he <i>cannot</i> spring a boner in front of his aunt.</p>\n<p>May\u2019s eyes refocus on Wade. \u201cBut I have to let him make his choices, even if I don\u2019t agree with them, and if he\u2019s going to be out there, putting his life on the line, well. I\u2019ll be honest with you, Wade, I\u2019d prefer someone like you having his back. Someone whose primary concern is his safety and who will do whatever it takes to bring him home alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[She can\u2019t possibly be suggesting what we\u2019re thinking?]]</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re down with the killing?\u201d Wade asks, dubious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI--\u201d May looks flustered and takes another gulp of her drink. She swallows and clears her throat. \u201cI think--Well, Peter has a very strong moral code, and I\u2019m so proud of him. But I\u2019m not naive. I can\u2019t help but notice how so many of the people he fights come back again and again, killing and hurting more people every time. I\u2019m not saying I condone killing, but I understand that sometimes it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay, you are a delightfully unexpected surprise in an absurdly hot package.\u201d</p>\n<p>May blushes. \u201cI\u2019m going to go refill my drink.\u201d She stands and snatches Wade\u2019s from him too on the way to the kitchen. </p>\n<p>While she\u2019s gone, the distant sound of sirens rings out, and then Wade\u2019s cell chimes from his pocket. It\u2019s Peter saying he\u2019ll be back soon. May must have gotten the same text, because all the tension from her shoulders has eased when she comes back with fresh margaritas.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, I know it must have been rough for you, finding out about Peter--shit that\u2019s not true, I have no idea what it must have been like. I\u2019m still trying to deal with the fact that he was doing this when he was a kid, and you--\u201d</p>\n<p>May\u2019s eyes are a little watery, and it strikes Wade that maybe she\u2019s never talked about this with anyone, which just in turn makes him pissy with Stark all over again. Like what kind of shitty ass support system has been for these people?! </p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never known him as anything other than Spider-Man. It\u2019s who he is. He wouldn\u2019t be your Peter anymore if he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d May says, voice all shaky. She dabs at the corner of her eyes. \u201cI think I\u2019m starting to see why he fell for you. You\u2019re a very good listener.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let it get around that I\u2019ve got a sensitive side--might ruin my image.\u201d</p>\n<p>[[For who? Everyone already knows that about you\u2026]]</p>\n<p>Spidey thankfully pops back in before the waterworks actually start, swinging in through the living room window still in his suit. He\u2019s carrying a plastic grocery bag on one wrist, and when he takes off his mask he\u2019s got a flush to his cheeks that makes Wade want to carry him off and do naughty things. It still gives him a thrill every time Spidey exposes his face, to know that Wade is one of the trusted few outside of the Avengers. Plus there\u2019s just the general prettiness of his face and the way the suit hugs his body in all the right places.</p>\n<p>[We <i>just</i> got her approval, perhaps now is not the best time to grope her nephew\u2026]</p>\n<p>Peter gives him a look like he knows exactly what Wade is thinking, and pecks him on the cheek, before presenting his bag to them both with a flourish. \u201cThe neighbours paid me with fudge and cutout cookies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Aunt May perks up and stands. \u201cAnd I made fruit loaf!\u201d</p>\n<p>After she disappears into the kitchen, Peter bends to whisper in Wade\u2019s ear. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t eat it.\u201d Then he straightens and claps Wade on the shoulder. \u201cBRB, gotta change.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thing is, May is such a sweetheart and looks so earnestly pleased with herself when she presents the loaf, how is Wade supposed to say no? He hides a grimace behind what is likely a terrifying smile. \u201cDelicious,\u201d he manages around his mouthful.</p>\n<p>May beams at him. \u201cI got the recipe from Mary Berry on the Great British Bake-off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Wade struggles to swallow. \u201cMoist.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter saves the day with a pitcher of spiked horchata, which Wade chugs gratefully. They finally give up on Monopoly shortly after and settle in for May\u2019s movie pick. Once it\u2019s finished, Peter introduces Wade to their tradition of making new ornaments for the tree each year. Wade sort of wants to make a snide comment about it, but who would he be kidding?? He\u2019s so down for arts and crafts.</p>\n<p>There's a fair amount of smack talk between the three of them, whose ornament will be best, and eventually devolves into flinging glitter and festive pom poms tacky with glue, while May moans about how she\u2019s never going to get the glitter out of her house now. The end results are hideous, but May still hangs each in a place of pride on the tree.</p>\n<p>Wade had such anxiety over this whole meeting the family thing that he\u2019s sort of in disbelief by how well it\u2019s gone. He isn\u2019t even aware of how much time has passed until Peter joyfully exclaimes it\u2019s midnight and goes to gather the gifts under the tree. Wade slips back Peter\u2019s room for his jacket to get May\u2019s present.</p>\n<p>[I\u2019m still not sure this is the best idea.]</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Wade mutters. \u201cI give the best gifts.\u201d</p>\n<p>May presents them both with lumpy packages wrapped in rainbow snowflake papers, practically bouncing with excitement. \u201cThe pattern was a little more challenging than my normal projects, but I think they came out.\u201d She gestures at the throws all around the room.</p>\n<p>Peter and Wade tear into them at the same time. Wade pulls his out, a knit beanie in a red and blue web pattern, with Spidey\u2019s mask eyes on the front and tiny spiders around the bottom. He pulls it on his head and turns to see Peter\u2019s already opened and donned his as well--bold black and red with Wade\u2019s mask on the front.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways knew you\u2019d look good in my suit, babe,\u201d Wade says, and the sparkle in Peter\u2019s eyes suggests that Wade might get to see him in it sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, ah. I wasn\u2019t sure what you might want,\u201d Wade says, when he hand the envelope over to May. She opens it, her eyes getting wide, mouth dropping open just a little. \u201cPeter mentioned you work long hours and don\u2019t have a lot of time for cooking, so this should make things easier. You just need to fill out the information on what you like\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWade, this is--\u201d May holds the paper out for Peter to take. It's six months of premade meals delivered fresh daily, based on her preference. \u201cThis is very generous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade shrugs. \u201cMerc work pays pretty well.\u201d What he can\u2019t say is that she\u2019s taken such good care of Peter and she deserves to have someone take care of her, because that\u2019s probably too intimate a thing to say.</p>\n<p>[[And since when has that stopped you?]]</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you\u2019ve put my beanies to shame,\u201d May says with a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Wade pulls it tighter down over his head. \u201cI\u2019m never taking this thing off. It\u2019s coming in the shower with me. It\u2019s going on over the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou only think he\u2019s joking,\u201d Peter sighs. </p>\n<p>They\u2019ve already agreed they\u2019ll exchange their gifts for each other the day after Christmas at Peter\u2019s place, so Wade doesn\u2019t mind sitting back to watch as Peter and May open their other presents to one another. They\u2019re both so earnestly pleased no matter how small the gift, it\u2019s like they can\u2019t actually be real, right? Something out of a movie about the spirit of Christmas being the thought that counts or some shit. </p>\n<p>All the remains after are the stockings, which Peter has explained are for Christmas morning. Wade is not to be blamed for the slightly choked feeling he gets when May brings them out to be hung and there\u2019s one with Wade\u2019s name embroidered on it along with May and Peter\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we supposed to sleep in separate bunks?\u201d Wade asks, after they\u2019ve brushed their teeth and Peter\u2019s dug out some oversized Hello Kitty pj pants for him from the back of the closet.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cI hardly think Aunt May cares, if that\u2019s what you mean. So sure, by all means, let\u2019s both try to squeeze onto a twin mattress together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade rubs his hands together. \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to take that as a challenge,\u201d he says. Peter rolls his eyes and huffs in annoyance as Wade maneuvers them around the bed, but he allows himself to be tucked up between Wade and the edge of the bed with Wade\u2019s arms and legs wound around him and not a breath of space between them. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even seem to mind the press of Wade\u2019s growing erection against the curve of his ass, despite the sound of Aunt May still shuffling around in the living room, tidying up.</p>\n<p>[[You fucking lech.]]</p>\n<p>There was squirming and rubbing, okay, and Wade is only human, albeit a mutated one.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you even capable of being quiet?\u201d Peter whispers.</p>\n<p>Wade gives a little rock of his hips. \u201cI\u2019m up for it if you are, babe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter presses his face into his pillow and makes a sound somewhere between arousal and exasperation. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to do this,\u201d he mutters, then turns to look at Wade over his shoulder. \u201cI swear to god if you make a sound, I\u2019m kicking you out of bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeak for yourself, Spidey,\u201d Wade whispers, as tugs down his pj pants just enough to free his dick. Peter wriggles around to do the same, getting the elastic waist down around his thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re the noisy one. All those whines and moans, so fucking hot, Jesus, just thinking about it gets me going.\u201d He gets a handful of Peter\u2019s ass, kneading and spreading him open to drive his dick between his cheeks, proving his point.</p>\n<p>Peter fumbles at the bedside table, only managing not to fall out of the bed thanks to Wade\u2019s hold on him and grabs a bottle of lube. Doesn\u2019t waste any time popping the cap and squeezing a handful into his palm before reaching back to fist Wade\u2019s cock. Wade has to take a centering breath to keep from groaning at that first slick touch. Presses his face in the nape of Peter\u2019s neck as he pumps his hand up and down a few times, spreading the lube around, and then he\u2019s guiding Wade to his hole.</p>\n<p>The initial resistance gives and Wade pushes inside in a long, slow glide. Peter\u2019s got his eyes screwed up tight, bottom lip between his teeth, holding his breath until Wade\u2019s completely sheathed, and then Wade just stays there a long minute, while Peter takes several shakey, panting breaths as he adjusts. Fuck, Peter\u2019s already sweating along his brow from just this, working his hips back in tiny, fitful movements, like it\u2019s killing him to be quiet.</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t really move much, between the lack of space and the creaky frame that gives a squeak of protest every time they shift position. After a few experimental thrusts, Wade finds just the right angle that lets him roll his hips. Pulling maybe an inch back and it feels like he\u2019s going deeper and deeper each time--not much friction, but it\u2019s still so fucking good. Peter must think so too, the way his mouth is hanging open on a silent cry, hands fisted in his pillow.</p>\n<p>And shit, Wade never would have thought he could cum like this, with so little stimulation, but maybe it\u2019s just the illicitness of doing it in Petey\u2019s childhood bedroom, or the effort to keep quiet making his lungs burn and his skin too tight. Peter\u2019s nothing but one long, tense line, muscles drawn tight. </p>\n<p>Wade shifts a hand from Peter\u2019s hip to smooth over his belly towards his cock, but Peter catches it and laces their fingers together, holding them tight against his chest. \u201cLike this,\u201d he moans. It\u2019s nothing more than the breath of an exhale, but still loud in the silence of the room, with nothing but their heavy breathing. \u201cMake me cum like this, Wade.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Jesus, that is dirty pool. Wade\u2019s already so wound up, Peter\u2019s so tight with his thighs trapped together, and the elastic of his pants rubs against the underside of Wade\u2019s dick with every movement. \u201cWhat do you need, baby?\u201d Because if Peter doesn\u2019t cum soon, Wade\u2019s not going to be able to hold off.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust this,\u201d Peter whines, too loud, and bites his lip again. Twists his hips in this restless little grind on Wade\u2019s cock. </p>\n<p>Wade licks up the line of his spine, grits his teeth against the desire to just roll Peter onto his belly and fuck him hard. He puts a little more force behind his next trust and the bed squeaks. They both freeze, Wade straining to hear a reaction, but all he can hear is the distant sound of the kitchen sink running, so he does it again, and again, a handful of rough, rolling thrusts, each punctuated by the squeak of the bed, and then Peter starts to cum, clenching down so hard Wade can\u2019t even move. He just rides it out and gives over to the hot pulse around his cock. Bites down on the back of Peter\u2019s neck to keep from making any noise pumps Petey full of his cum.</p>\n<p>After, Peter is pliable and sleepy in his arms. \u201cNow aren\u2019t you glad I talked you into coming for Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should know by now it doesn\u2019t take much talking to get me to cum,\u201d Wade says with a waggle of his brows, as he cleans them both up with tissues from the nightstand and gets their pajamas back in place.</p>\n<p>Peter covers his face with both hands, but the shaking of his shoulders gives away his silent laughter. \u201cThat was awful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you have any room to talk. Have you <i>heard</i> yourself mid-fight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love my jokes,\u201d Peter protests.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, everyone knows I have a shit sense of humour.\u201d</p>\n<p>From there it descends into a wrestling match, until Peter has Wade flat on his back and curls up on top of him, settling in like a contented kitten. \u201cI have the best jokes,\u201d he insists.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have the best jokes,\u201d Wade parrots back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love <i>you</i>,\u201d Wade amends.</p>\n<p>Peter either doesn\u2019t notice, or doesn\u2019t care, already mostly asleep. \u201cLove you too,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>[[Even I have to admit the evening wasn\u2019t an unmitigated disaster.]]</p>\n<p>\u201cGee thanks,\u201d Wade snorts.</p>\n<p>[Family\u2019s not an F-word.]</p>\n<p>And yeah, Wade still needs that reminder from time to time, but here, with Peter in his arms, he knows it\u2019s true. \u201cSo, uh, Al and Weasel and I do this thing for New Year\u2019s. These days Dopinder and Cable and Domino and some of the X-People come along. Everyone brings a different type of carryout and drinks heavily, and sometimes the weapons come out, but no one\u2019s had to take a visit to the hospital in years. I know it\u2019s nothing like what you\u2019ve got with your aunt, but if you wanna come\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter squeezes him tight, some of that super strength bleeding in, making Wade\u2019s chest feel tight. Or maybe that\u2019s something else. Peter lifts his head to give Wade one of his happy, open, guileless smiles. \u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d he says.</p>"
