  "text": "<p>\u201cDraco Malfoy?\u201d Harry said in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ron pushed through the knot of people surrounding the eighth year notice board.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m down to share with Draco fucking Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Look.\u201d Harry pointed to the names on the list. \u201cHarry Potter. And Draco Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can\u2019t do that!\u201d Ron sounded outraged. \u201cNot to <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned, his eyes darting left and right to see who might have heard. It wasn\u2019t because of who <em>he</em> was that he minded. He didn\u2019t expect any special favours or anything. It was just because\u2026 well. Because of who <em>Malfoy</em> was.</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s clear voice rang out over the babble of conversation. \u201cWhere\u2019s Millicent Bulstrode?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Millicent asked, rather aggressively.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sharing with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Millicent looked less than delighted at this news.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we go and have a look at our new room?\u201d Hermione asked, trying her best at a friendly smile, but giving up in the face of Millicent\u2019s cold stare. \u201cOh come on, Millicent. It\u2019s not like we have any choice, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron was still frowning at the list. \u201cWho\u2019s Stephen Cornfoot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Ravenclaw,\u201d someone answered. \u201cUsually comes top.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Ron shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s going to work out well, me and him. Is McGonagall having a laugh or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry resisted the other bodies trying to jostle him aside, standing firm so he could read the line with his name on for the fourth time. Yep. It still said <em>Malfoy</em>, all official-looking in McGonagall\u2019s rather scratchy handwriting, and signed at the bottom. He could imagine her face now if he went and asked her to change it. The same kind of face she had made when he and Ron had arrived at Hogwarts in a flying car.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut seriously, mate, we need to kick up a fuss about this,\u201d Ron went on. \u201cYou and Malfoy? It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt a pointy elbow in his ribs as someone else pushed their way to the notice board.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s haughty voice cut through the chatter. \u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned around with a scowl. Malfoy seemed to have grown another inch or two over the summer, and looked more angular than ever, hollow cheeks leading down to a sharp jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, they really do hate me around here, don\u2019t they?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s lip drew up into a sneer.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Ron told him. \u201cHarry\u2019s not going to share with you. Anyone who thinks he is has got to be kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Malfoy raised an eyebrow and turned to Harry. \u201cGoing to ask for special treatment, instead? Get paired up with one of your many admirers? Of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry\u2019s hands were clenched in his pockets. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron drew an indignant breath, but Harry didn\u2019t give him a chance. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>fine</em>, Ron.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another half dozen people had arrived and were trying to get a look at the list. This time, Harry allowed himself to be nudged out of the way.</p>\n<p>Ron spoke more quietly. \u201cAre we just going to\u2014\u201d He broke off as two students in Ravenclaw robes joined them. \u201cI\u2019m Stephen Cornfoot,\u201d one told Ron, his face rather pale and serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Right. I\u2019m Ron Weasley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I know. We\u2019re going to find our rooms, if you want to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron looked uncertainly at Harry and then back to Stephen. \u201cYeah\u2026 In a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, Ron.\u201d Harry pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron loped away, following the Ravenclaws. Harry and Malfoy were left together, standing a little apart from the crowd. \u201cOh, not Zach Smith!\u201d someone at the notice board exclaimed in tones of horror, and Harry saw Malfoy smirk to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and unpack.\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou can do yours when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d Maybe if they didn\u2019t spend any time together in the room, maybe if they literally went up there just to sleep...</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, and let you bag the best bed? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell. Come on, then,\u201d Harry said, his jaw tightening with the desire to smack Malfoy round his stupid, pointy face, and walked off quickly without waiting to see if Malfoy was following.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was a neat little room near the Astronomy tower. There were a couple of chairs and a decent-sized wooden desk. There was a shower room attached, with a toilet and washbasin. The window faced onto the Quidditch pitch, and Harry could see that, in other circumstances, it would be pretty nice to sleep up here, quite cosy and comfortable, with their own private bathroom and a space to work.</p>\n<p>But then there was the matter of the two beds. One for him, and one for Malfoy. Somehow more than anything, this hammered home the reality of it. That he would be spending eighth year sharing with the one person who\u2014</p>\n<p>Well. Someone Harry had never considered living in close quarters with.</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked around, his lip curling, then gestured with his wand to send his trunk skidding over the floor to the bed in the far corner. \u201cI\u2019ll have that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opened his mouth to protest, but then bit it back. It was only a bed. And he preferred to sleep near the window, anyway. He walked over to look out over the grounds.</p>\n<p>Malfoy opened the lid of his trunk. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they give us separate rooms, for god\u2019s sake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there <em>are</em> any separate rooms.\u201d Harry\u2019s eye ran over the pile of rubble that used to be the Owlery. \u201cThere are barely enough classrooms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come back if I\u2019d realised things were going to be so disorganised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPity no-one told you, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy shot him a foul look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d Harry went on. \u201cIf they thought you were in danger, they\u2019d probably put you somewhere else. I\u2019d be happy to Hex you badly enough to get you moved to the hospital wing, for instance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy narrowed his eyes. \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked innocent. \u201cOnly trying to be helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead and try it.\u201d Malfoy gripped his wand, the length of hawthorn that Harry knew so intimately. It seemed strange to see it again after so many months, and in Malfoy\u2019s pale hand rather than his own. \u201cJust try it, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry realised he was staring, and shook himself. \u201cThis is stupid. Don\u2019t you think everyone expects us to fight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care what other people <em>expect</em>,\u201d Malfoy hissed.</p>\n<p>Harry considered just Stunning him and letting it all go to hell. It would be so easy; he could feel it throbbing through his fingers, could imagine Malfoy falling down senseless, still and mercifully quiet. Instead Harry threw the lid of his trunk open with a bang and began to take out his books. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this done and then we can go down and eat. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t answer, but turned his back on Harry as he flicked his wand at books, robes and toiletries to send them all bobbing to their correct places. Harry didn\u2019t want to admit it, but it was a neat piece of charmwork. He satisfied his feelings by dumping his books in a messy pile on the shelf next to Malfoy\u2019s neatly ordered one. It looked like this was going to be a very long term.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s Stephen thingy?\u201d Harry slid in beside Ron at the Gryffindor table.</p>\n<p>\u201cCornfoot. What kind of a name is Cornfoot?\u201d Ron poured them both a glass of pumpkin juice from the brimming jugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he is, because he doesn\u2019t say anything. Just sits there bloody reading. How\u2019s Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill a git.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo surprises there. I still think you should talk to McGonagall about it. They can\u2019t expect you two to get through the year without AK-ing one another. And really, mate, you deserve a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt the unexpected prickling of self-pity in his throat. He had been so looking forward to coming back to Hogwarts. And now this. But fuck it. He wasn\u2019t going to let Malfoy ruin everything. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay out of his way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I guess. Oh, I saw Seamus. He\u2019s in with Terry Boot; we\u2019ve decided that\u2019s going to be the party room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione leaned over. \u201cWe need to be studying, Ron, and you know it. We missed practically a whole year. I reread all of my notes from sixth year over the holidays, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron rolled his eyes. \u201cLessons haven\u2019t even started, Hermione. Seamus has smuggled a bottle of something past Filch. Eight o\u2019clock in their room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cYou heard Professor McGonagall, we\u2019re meant to be setting a good example to the rest of the school, and getting legless is hardly going to help us do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the holidays,\u201d Ron said with emphasis. \u201cTerm starts tomorrow. And if I can have one more day of relaxation, I think I\u2019ve bloody earned it. Oh, come on, Hermione. McGonagall said that the common rooms are off limits while we get to know the people we\u2019re sharing with. So it\u2019s come with us to Seamus and Terry\u2019s, or spend the evening in your room with Millicent Bulstrode.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione let out a sigh. \u201cAll right. But just this one evening. This is our most important school year, and I want to make the most of it.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Our most important school year</em>. Was that true? Harry had certainly been intending to make the most of it, but nothing seemed as he had expected, and he had to swallow down the lump in his throat with a draught of pumpkin juice before he could speak again.</p>\n<p>With a small pop, the feast appeared before them. A first year gave a loud squeal of surprise and a ripple of laughter went up. The food did look bloody good. There were steak pies topped with golden pastry, large joints of every kind of meat filling the room with savoury smells, towers of succulent sausages, buttery mashed potatoes piled high, heaped platters of vegetables, sauces and all the trimmings you could wish for. Harry\u2019s stomach gave a grateful growl and he reached for the roast chicken.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was maybe two a.m., and as Harry made his way to his new room, he was hazy and relaxed. Well. Maybe a little more than relaxed. Maybe a fair bit drunk.</p>\n<p>He felt like perhaps everything would be OK after all. He was home. The castle felt just the same, even though bits of it were fucked up. A bit like him, he thought, and smiled to himself as he climbed the steps to his new room. Coming back to Hogwarts after missing it so much was like sinking into a warm bath after being out on a freezing cold day. It had been great to see Dean and Neville again. The Ravenclaws who had joined the party seemed friendly enough, Seamus had provided a generous supply of alcohol, and Ron, for a change, hadn\u2019t once asked when Harry was going to get back together with Ginny. He wondered if Filch had been told to leave the eighth year students alone for the evening, but whatever the reason, they had been able to talk until the small hours, and Harry felt happier than he had done for a long time.</p>\n<p>The room was dark as Harry inched the door open. It felt so odd to be coming back here rather than getting into bed next to the others in the old Gryffindor dorm. However, inside it was warm and quiet, with a faint smell of something sweet and spicy, like Malfoy had been eating some kind of treat before bed. Harry slipped his shoes off and was planning to tumble straight into bed and go to sleep, when he tripped over something solid and very pointy on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit!\u201d He clutched at his toes, which were throbbing with pain. \u201cOw, fucking ow.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could hear Malfoy sitting up. \u201cWhat the bloody hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBumped into something.\u201d Harry found the bed and sank onto it, casting a low <em>Lumos</em>. \u201cMerlin, your blasted trunk. What did you leave it there for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to be crashing around like an Erumpent at two in the bloody morning, did I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOw.\u201d Harry nursed his bruises. \u201cYour fault for booby-trapping the room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny chance of getting back to sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDepends whether you shut up and stop being an arsehole.\u201d Harry felt pretty pleased at the wit of his own reply. His tongue felt thick from the elf-rum, and his blood pumped hot and lazy around his body. He realised he\u2019d quite like a proper fight with Malfoy. In fact, it would be great if Malfoy said something really shitty back, so that Harry would have to go over there and make him wish he hadn\u2019t. He could imagine the two of them wrestling together, the ozone-y crackle of magic in the air, and Malfoy\u2019s angular body struggling against his.</p>\n<p>He stood up in anticipation but sat back down again, suddenly dizzy as the blood rushed away from his head. \u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry lay down, then realised he was still fully dressed. \u201cYep.\u201d He sat up and pulled his shirt over his head, yanking as it got stuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this going to be something that happens every night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno.\u201d Harry kicked his jeans off and fumbled with his socks. \u201cCould be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I should think myself lucky you didn\u2019t bring a girl back here for some inept shagging.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, ha,\u201d Harry said. \u201cFunny.\u201d He could totally still go over there and punch Malfoy. If he wanted to. But the bed was wonderfully soft, and he\u2019d bet that it would feel so good under the covers if he slid his legs in, like that. Ah, yes. He would just close his eyes for a moment. Only a moment.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>The sun was streaming in across Harry\u2019s bed and some fucker had drawn the curtains back so that the light could abuse his eyes even more cruelly. Harry groaned, and then wished he hadn\u2019t, because that hurt, too. Then he remembered where he was, and why, and groaned again. The shower was running, the sound of water pounding against tile magnified in his head. He groped on the bedside table for a drink and gulped it down. Hell, he wished he had a hangover potion. Then he remembered. Seamus had given him one last night, and he had put it\u2026 where?</p>\n<p>He sat up and Accioed his jeans. <em>Yes</em>. There it was, in the hip pocket, the tiny, precious phial. He had just swallowed it down and sank back against the pillow, relief already trickling through his veins, when the bathroom door opened and Malfoy walked in.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s alive,\u201d Malfoy said, then wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou smell like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pulled the sheets up over himself. He seemed to have stripped naked last night when he got into bed, and Malfoy being here\u2026 well, it was weird. No, it was <em>fucking</em> weird. He looked around for his glasses, but couldn\u2019t find them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the floor,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cI thought about treading on them, but it seemed a bit juvenile.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swiped them up and pushed them onto his nose. His stomach lurched at the sudden movement, but it was already settling, the potion doing its work. Malfoy was sitting on the bed, doing up his shirt. Harry stared for a moment. It was just so disorientating to see Malfoy sitting there, barefoot, a slice of his pale chest exposed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long til breakfast?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout ten minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou certainly look it.\u201d Malfoy fastened his tie with a few deft motions.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Harry said. As an insult, it lacked finesse, but it was all he could manage at that moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI intend to.\u201d Malfoy stood up. \u201cNot planning to spend any longer here than I have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Harry. He really needed a piss. And he didn\u2019t particularly want to get up and walk to the bathroom naked, not with Malfoy there looking all self-possessed. \u201cGo on, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy shook his head and used his wand to lace his shoes. \u201cTosser.\u201d He flung his robes over his shoulders. \u201cWell, see you around. Hope you have a crappy day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat up straight, the covers falling to his waist. \u201cHope you choke on your cornflakes, you wanker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy gave him a look Harry couldn\u2019t quite place, half disgust, half\u2026 something else. His eyes flicked over Harry\u2019s bare torso and Harry pulled the covers around himself again, glowering at Malfoy and daring him to say anything more. Harry would go for him if he did, he bloody would, and hang the consequences. But Malfoy merely walked out, looking disdainful and letting the door bang shut behind him.</p>\n<p>Harry sank back with a frustrated exhalation. Merlin, this was never going to work. Never, never, never in a million years. He considered running away. Going back to Grimmauld Place with its dust and memories and ghosts and just hiding there until he forgot all about the war, about all those who were lost, about all the mistakes he had made and everything that had been done to him and those he loved. Until he couldn\u2019t even remember Malfoy\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>One day, this would all be in the past, right? He\u2019d be looking back on it, maybe sharing it as a story with his grandchildren or something. <em>And then, after the war, when I went back to Hogwarts to do my NEWTs, I punched Draco Malfoy right in the nose, and I can tell you, children, it felt good.</em></p>\n<p>Harry grinned despite himself. He forced his now only slightly-hungover body out of bed and towards the shower. He was going to be late for breakfast.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Once Harry had eaten porridge with cream and honey, and a fat bacon roll which oozed salty grease, he felt vastly improved, enough to walk over to Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione. Eighth year lessons were starting that afternoon, so they spent a nostalgic morning perusing the shops and spending a few Galleons. Hermione had developed a taste for Ice Mints \u2013 she said they cleared the mind brilliantly \u2013 so their last stop took them to Honeydukes.</p>\n<p>While Hermione paid, the young witch at the counter passed Harry a plate bearing a selection of small bonbons. \u201cTry one,\u201d she said, lowering her long lashes at Harry. \u201cOur new flavours for autumn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d Harry popped one into his mouth and nodded happily as smooth chocolate melted on his tongue. Then a zing of something fiery exploded in his mouth. <em>Ahh</em>, ginger, hot and sharp and delicious, with just a hint of sweetness. He was reminded of the smell in their room last night \u2013 maybe Malfoy had been eating these before bed? \u201cThey\u2019re really good,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ll buy a box.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the house,\u201d the witch giggled, and would accept no gold, despite Harry\u2019s protests.</p>\n<p>Outside, Harry offered the box to Ron and Hermione. \u201cYou have to try these.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. Not bad,\u201d Ron said. \u201cShe liked you, mate, in case you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook down his fringe to cover his scar. \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously. She was quite nice-looking, too.\u201d He looked to Hermione for support. \u201cWasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione just rolled her eyes and took Ron\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll be late for our first lesson.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It had been a long day, and Harry was ready for sleep, but as often happened, it was taking him a while. He lay in the dark, listening to the quiet, small sounds of Malfoy breathing. It was nothing new to hear other people in the dorm, moving about or snoring or fidgeting their way to sleep. But to know it was just him and Malfoy there, alone in the dark in this small room\u2026 that was quite unsettling. It was often difficult for Harry to drop off, to let go and trust that nothing bad would happen while his guard was down. It was as if part of him needed to be alert at all times. He didn\u2019t know what for, exactly. Just in case he was needed.</p>\n<p>Letting himself slip away into obliviousness with Draco Malfoy only a few feet away was such a counter-intuitive thing to do. Harry felt for the wand under his pillow and lay with his fingers resting against the cool, smooth wood, his thumb stroking across the familiar groove on its handle, over and over. He let his breath come slow and steady, taking in the scents of the room \u2013 old books and parchment, thick wool blankets, and that intriguing smell of spices, until his body finally relaxed enough for him to drift off to sleep.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t know what time it was, but it was nowhere near morning. He found his wand and opened the curtains a couple of inches, just enough to see a slice of the sky sprinkled thickly with stars.</p>\n<p>He lay there for a while, just looking and trying not to think about anything, when he heard Malfoy sit up and get a drink. Malfoy lay down again, but Harry could hear from his movements that he wasn\u2019t going back to sleep, and after a while, Malfoy sighed.</p>\n<p>It seemed ridiculous, both lying there in the dark and not speaking. \u201cCan\u2019t you get to sleep, either?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy sounded haughty. \u201cI got to sleep fine, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. \u201cYeah, but you\u2019re awake now. And it\u2019s about three a.m.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I do know that.\u201d Malfoy was quiet for a minute, and then, \u201cPointing it out doesn\u2019t make it any less shit.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Merlin</em>. Harry bit back a retort. It was no time for an argument, and he didn\u2019t much want to think about why Malfoy couldn\u2019t sleep, what thoughts came to him in the middle of the night, what troubles whispered in his ear and crept into the dark, helpless corners of his brain. It was worse, somehow, than thinking about Harry\u2019s own ghosts.</p>\n<p>The room was quiet for a while. Then Malfoy said, \u201cOpen the curtain a bit more, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry used his wand again and then lay in silence, looking at the stars. He must have slept again, eventually, because the next thing he knew, light was streaming in and he could hear the shower running full blast.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry avoided Malfoy as much as he could that day. It wasn\u2019t hard, because they had a full day of classes, the first assignments were set, and the usual, comforting rhythm of meals and owl post and trips to the library and homework began all over again.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s attention did stray to Malfoy in Charms, but only because Malfoy looked like he was in danger of falling asleep over his book, dark shadows around his eyes and his pale complexion ashier than usual. But Malfoy, feeling Harry\u2019s eyes on him, pulled himself up poker-straight and glared in Harry\u2019s direction until he looked away.</p>\n<p>There was a bit of a gathering in Seamus\u2019s room again that evening, but this time, Harry declined to swig from the near-empty bottle of spirits as it came round, and headed up to his new room around ten thirty. Malfoy was already in bed, lying with his back to Harry, and didn\u2019t acknowledge him as he came in. Harry felt pretty sure Malfoy was only pretending to be asleep, but it was a relief not to have to speak to him, so he undressed quietly and slipped into bed.</p>\n<p>He lay for a while, willing his body to unwind. He could hear the owls hunting. He knew Muggles found the sound eerie, the low hoots and sharp shrieks. But to Harry, they simply meant that he was at Hogwarts. His lack of sleep from last night meant it was easier than usual to sink towards a doze. But just as he was on the threshold of relaxation, his senses softening and blurring, he heard a noise from the other bed and was instantly alert again.</p>\n<p>Harry lay still, his heart banging against his ribs. All was silent at first, and he wondered if he had dreamed it, but no, there it was again. A low, breathless sound, then a slow exhalation, as if Malfoy was hurt, or perhaps\u2014</p>\n<p><em>Oh</em>.</p>\n<p>Malfoy did it again and this time, it was unmistakably a very quiet moan of pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Malfoy?\u201d Harry felt his cheeks flushing.</p>\n<p>Malfoy went very still.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t even know why he was so annoyed, but he was.</p>\n<p>There was a rustling of blankets. \u201cThat\u2019s a stupid fucking question, even for you, Potter. My dick didn\u2019t suddenly stop working just because I have to share a room with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Harry\u2019s ears were burning with heat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2013 You can\u2019t just\u2013 Why can\u2019t you wank in the shower?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy sounded as if it was <em>Harry</em> who was being unreasonable. \u201cI did. But are you trying to tell me you only do it once a day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. Maybe not. But that wasn\u2019t the point. \u201cI was almost asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood for you. I thought you <em>were</em> asleep, as it happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not, so can you keep the noise down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, like you did when you crashed in here on Tuesday night? Bloody hell. Such a fuss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a fuss? I\u2019m not the one who was lying there playing with myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your concern, Potter. Now, I want to finish off and get some sleep, so I suggest you stick a pillow over your head if the thought of it bothers you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t wait to hear if Malfoy meant it or not. He shoved his fists angrily over his ears and kept them there for a good five minutes. Even though he couldn\u2019t hear anything, it was hard not to picture what was happening in the other bed, and to ignore his own cock stirring with interest at the thought that Harry could do the same if he wanted. He screwed his face up in the darkness. He didn\u2019t want to think about this \u2013 Malfoy stroking himself with those long fingers, his body jerking into his own fist...</p>\n<p>When Harry finally took his hands away from his ears, Malfoy was lying quietly, probably not quite asleep yet, but his breathing was deep and even. <em>The bastard</em>. It would serve him right if Harry did the same thing. See how he\u2019d like that. Harry didn\u2019t touch himself, all the same. Instead he lay there, listening to the owls\u2019 hoots, and making a mental list of the top five Hexes he\u2019d like to use on Malfoy, until sleep finally came.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>The Knut was starting to drop that this year was a lot more academically challenging than Harry had expected. Nobody suggested a get-together in Seamus\u2019s room the following evening; instead they headed to the library or to their own rooms to work. Harry wandered down towards the Hufflepuff basement to find Hermione\u2019s room and ask if she could lend him her Potions notes. If he was honest, half of today\u2019s class had gone right over his head.</p>\n<p>He was prepared for the possibility of Millicent Bulstrode, but he hadn\u2019t expected to find a whole group of girls crowded into the room. There were eighth years and seventh years too, in Slytherin and Ravenclaw robes, sitting on the beds and, in some cases, the floor. Some of them were studying, some chatting, and one girl was using her wand to do another\u2019s hair up into a what looked like a very elaborate sparkly topknot. He didn\u2019t recognise all of them, but from the snickers and whispered comments, they seemed to know him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr. I was looking for Hermione,\u201d he said, trying not to look as awkward as he felt.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione\u2019s voice came from the desk. He hadn\u2019t seen her there in the corner. \u201cI\u2019m <em>here</em>.\u201d She sounded embarrassed, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Right. Potions notes? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione merely rolled her eyes and passed some parchment to the girl nearest to her, who passed it across the room until it reached the girl nearest Harry, a dark-haired Slytherin. Harry put out his hand to take it, but the girl held it out of reach. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you boys do your own work in future, instead of copying from Granger?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>copying</em>, thanks. I didn\u2019t quite get the thing about the Bloodroot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione shook her head. \u201cOh, let him have it, Petra.\u201d</p>\n<p>Petra gave the scroll to Harry, looking seriously unimpressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said, deliberately addressing Hermione rather than Petra. <em>Blimey</em>. Was it like this in here every night? How did she get any work done? \u201cEr\u2026 are you OK?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Hermione pushed her hair off her face and gave him a tired smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hesitated; he didn\u2019t want to hang around, but it didn\u2019t feel right leaving Hermione in there, either. \u201cDo you want to come with me to the library or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really. I\u2019m almost finished.\u201d Hermione turned to one of the girls sitting on the floor. \u201cMandy, can I see that page again? The one with the chart showing the decline in the Merpeople population?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019ll</em> come with you,\u201d the girl having her hair done told Harry, in a voice obviously meant to be suggestive, and several of the others sniggered.</p>\n<p><em>Blimey</em>. Harry glanced at Hermione but she was bent over her work again. \u201cBye, then,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cThanks for the notes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione just waved a hand, but a rather derisive chorus of \u201c<em>Bye</em>,\u201d followed Harry as he got out of there as fast as he could.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>That night, in bed, Harry realised he was listening out for what Malfoy might be up to. He was knackered, again, but he sort of kept himself awake, just to see if it would happen again. He didn\u2019t think he would have noticed, this time, if he hadn\u2019t have been expecting it. Malfoy\u2019s movements were pretty slow and quiet, and it was only the occasional hitch of his breath that made Harry sure he was listening to more than Malfoy simply falling asleep.</p>\n<p>The thing was, after years of sleeping in dormitories, it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d never overheard this kind of thing before. If it had been Ron, or Dean, or whoever, Harry would have just ignored it, not thought anything of it at all. But this felt different. He kept quiet, trying to ignore his own cock, which was telling him it had been a long time since he\u2019d brought himself off in the shower that morning, and resigned himself to waiting for it to be over.</p>\n<p>Then Malfoy\u2019s voice came in the dark, low and slightly irritated. \u201cI know you\u2019re listening.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time it was Harry\u2019s turn to freeze. But he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. He was just waiting for Malfoy to shut up, so he could go to sleep\u2014 \u201cNo I bloody wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor god\u2019s sake, why don\u2019t you get yourself off as well, instead of lying there huffing at me,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cMaybe then we can both sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s cock seemed to think this was a fantastic idea, and for some reason that made Harry crosser than ever. \u201cPiss off. Not everyone is like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Not everyone likes a good wank before they go to bed? I\u2019m pretty certain you\u2019re wrong there. I think just about every eighteen-year-old boy on the planet does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to do that in public,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn public? What are you talking about?\u201d Malfoy asked. His voice was still breathy, despite his annoyance. As though he\u2019d been really close when Harry interrupted him. \u201cI was actually being quiet, but if you\u2019re determined to lie there listening\u2026. Maybe you\u2019d have less of a pole up your arse all the bloody time if you\u2019d let yourself have one off the wrist when you needed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s cock twitched even as his face flushed with anger. It was the way the crude words sounded in Malfoy\u2019s snooty voice. Harry was just really wound up, from having to share a room with Malfoy, and not being able to sleep very well. There was all of the weird stuff that he couldn\u2019t get used to, like seeing Malfoy coming out of the shower every morning and that bloody spicy ginger smell which he was pretty sure was Malfoy\u2019s cologne. \u201cDo what the hell you like, Malfoy. I wasn\u2019t listening anyway. But if it bothers you so much, I\u2019ll use a pillow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shoved his head under the pillow and pushed it against his ears so he didn\u2019t have to hear any more. But it was too hot, and there wasn\u2019t enough air, and the whole thing seemed ridiculous, so Harry came out again, and\u2014</p>\n<p>Bloody hell, Malfoy was making more noises. They were still kind of quiet, but Malfoy didn\u2019t seem to be holding back so much any more. There were long, deep sighs, and then a hoarse groan, and, <em>fuck</em>, Harry was hard, properly hard, just thinking about what Malfoy must be doing to himself to make that kind of noise.</p>\n<p>At first Harry thought he would just listen, and then, as Malfoy carried on, Harry thought there was no way that Malfoy would know if he joined in. Malfoy was much too into it, and Harry could be quiet. Really quiet. He slipped his boxers down and his cock bounced wildly, brushing against the sheets, and even that felt bloody good. Harry wrapped his palm around his shaft and gave one, slow, experimental stroke, and then instinct took over and he started to wank in earnest.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was definitely far too wrapped up in his own pleasure to notice. He made a small, high sound like \u201c<em>Uh-uh</em>\u201d, as if he was not far away from coming, and Harry sped up his own pace. He never needed very long to bring himself off, and the quicker the better in this situation. Harry was quiet. So quiet, as his fist flew over his prick, his teeth digging into his bottom lip. Malfoy made a sound like a whimper, then groaned, long and deep, and Harry could imagine exactly what was happening in the next bed. He spread his legs as the first wave of his own orgasm hit him. He was still quiet as spunk pulsed over his fingers, spurting up towards his chest. <em>Uhhh</em>, yes, it was good, but he made no noise, only one low gasp which he choked off in his throat before it could escape.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, he felt warm and muzzy as he stretched his legs out comfortably under the cool sheets. He wasn\u2019t going to think about the fact he\u2019d just pulled himself off while listening to Draco Malfoy have an orgasm. He might even be able to get some sleep now. He heard Malfoy groping for his wand and muttering, and Harry congratulated himself on teaching himself a silent, wandless cleaning spell for occasions such as this. Malfoy never needed to know. He heard Malfoy roll over and then Malfoy asked in a sleepy voice, \u201cFeel better now?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>. How could Malfoy tell, when Harry had been so quiet and Malfoy had practically been yelping? Harry\u2019s face felt hotter than when he had tried to hide under the pillow. He said nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right. Are we not talking about it, then?\u201d Malfoy snorted in the darkness. \u201cMerlin, what a big deal about nothing. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve got off with someone else there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bloody <em>hell</em>. This was not a conversation Harry wanted to be having. This was not anything Malfoy needed to know about him. Maybe if he kept quiet, Malfoy would drop it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice niggled at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, OK?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice came out sounding far more bothered than he had intended.</p>\n<p>There was a low laugh. \u201cOh my god. You\u2019re not telling me it <em>is</em> the first time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt a wave of embarrassment and fury boil up inside of him. \u201cI thought you wanted to get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but this is really funny. Do you actually mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about that thing you had with Weasley\u2019s sister?\u201d Malfoy sounded wide awake again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of this is any of your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never fucked her?\u201d Malfoy sounded gleeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy, I\u2019m going to Hex your right hand off in a minute. See how your dick likes that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m perfectly proficient with my left, as well,\u201d Malfoy drawled. \u201cFrees the other one up for\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin. Stop there while I Obliviate myself.\u201d But Harry\u2019s brain was running through all the likely scenarios, and exactly how Malfoy would look in each of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, this is an eye opener for me,\u201d Malfoy said with satisfaction, and Harry could hear him rolling over and getting into a comfortable position for sleeping. \u201cI never knew Gryffindors were such prudes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry realised that Malfoy was simply delighted to have found a new way to get Harry riled up. If he ignored him, Malfoy would get bored much more quickly. \u201cI\u2019m falling asleep just hearing about your tedious wanking habits, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOK, Potter. You tell yourself that.\u201d Malfoy snickered to himself.</p>\n<p>Harry let his breathing get quiet and slow, hoping Malfoy would drop the whole conversation. But before long, he didn\u2019t need to pretend any longer. His body felt pleasantly wrung out and satisfied, and soon sleep stole over him, soft and warm as an owl\u2019s wing.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry came back to the room after lunch, flung the door open and \u2013 oh. Goyle was there, sitting in a chair with Malfoy perching on the desk next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPiss off, Potter,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry felt his hackles rising. \u201cThis is my room, too, you can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he noticed Goyle was sitting with his big fists pressed to his eyes, and making gulping sounds which suggested he was trying not to cry. Malfoy didn\u2019t exactly have his arm around Goyle, but he was sort of patting Goyle\u2019s shoulder while glaring at Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, <em>piss off</em>,\u201d Malfoy repeated.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Harry turned to the door. \u201cYou know, you could have asked nicely...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust <em>go</em>, will you?\u201d Malfoy asked, a fiercely protective look on his face that Harry had never seen before.</p>\n<p>It seemed like a good time to visit Ron. It wasn\u2019t that Harry had been avoiding him, but there was an irrational fear in the back of his mind that Ron would take one look at Harry and somehow <em>know</em> what Harry had done last night. He was being ridiculous, though. He headed for Ron\u2019s room near the Library, and as soon as he knocked, he heard Ron call, \u201cCome in, s\u2019not locked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pushed the door open and then stopped, feeling slightly awkward, as he realised Ron wasn\u2019t alone. He and his roommate were sitting opposite each other, a chess board between them. Ron got up when he saw Harry, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck. \u201cAh, alright mate? Just\u2026\u201d He gestured at the board. \u201cHe plays, too, so thought we might as well give it a go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded at the tall pale boy in Ravenclaw robes. \u201cHello.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cornfoot nodded in return, then continued frowning down at the chess board.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to go for a walk or something?\u201d Ron asked Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can finish this later,\u201d Ron told Cornfoot. \u201cOut to the lake, yeah?\u201d he asked Harry. The thing about having no common room was that it was harder to find places to hang out with your mates. And there had always been something comforting about it, too. Harry would have given a lot to be able to stroll into the Gryffindor common room right now and sink into one of the cosy, worn sofas.</p>\n<p>But McGonagall had been quite clear \u2013 the eighth years were not to use the common rooms until after Christmas at the earliest. \u201cGive yourself a chance to settle down with your new roommates,\u201d she had said. According to Hermione, when some of the Hufflepuff girls had protested to the Headmistress about it, McGonagall had got quite shirty. So a walk through the grounds would have to do.</p>\n<p>There were a few other eighth years by the lake. Most were standing and chatting, but two figures were kneeling down at the water\u2019s edge, and as they drew nearer, they could see that Hermione was one of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione!\u201d Ron said. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing fishing about down there? Have you lost something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cWe\u2019re just collecting some specimens of the plants growing here.\u201d She pushed up the sleeve of her robe to avoid it dragging in the water as she gathered what looked like murky pond water in a flask.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for? Herbology?\u201d Harry asked. He didn\u2019t remember any homework about collecting stuff from the lake.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Hermione looked a little embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually for schoolwork. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve got a theory about how the aquatic plant life here might use moonlight to photosynthesise, so we\u2019re taking some samples to check.\u201d She pushed her hair back from her face. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s enough now?\u201d she asked the blonde witch in Ravenclaw robes kneeling next to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat should be fine,\u201d said the other girl. \u201cIf we test it with wormwood, we can compare with the results of the pond water I brought from our garden at home, and then begin charting the effect of the moon over the next month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this for fun?\u201d Ron asked in dismay. \u201cAre they not giving you enough to do for your NEWTs?\u201d</p>\n<p>The blonde witch got to her feet and Hermione looked slightly anxious. \u201cOh, Ron, Harry. This is Mandy Brocklehurst. Her friend Lisa is sharing a room with Daphne Greengrass. And Daphne is Millicent\u2019s friend, so we all got chatting, and\u2026 well, it turns out Mandy and I have quite a lot in common.\u201d Hermione shrugged casually, but Harry noticed a happy flush on her face.</p>\n<p>Mandy began to tuck the specimen flasks safely away in her satchel as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in the aquatic life at Hogwarts for quite a while,\u201d she told the boys, \u201cbut I somehow never made the time to really explore it properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, actually,\u201d Hermione told Ron, \u201cand it could be important, too, because if we can find out how magical plants respond to moonlight without disrupting their circadian rhythms, it might have applications for\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Hermione,\u201d Ron moaned. \u201cI came out here to get away from that kind of stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mandy didn\u2019t seem discouraged by Ron\u2019s reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier with two of us working on it, and of course Hermione\u2019s knowledge of Herbology and Potions is pretty much the best I\u2019ve come across, so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s ears were turning pink with pleasure and she let her hair fall down over her face, but Harry could see her smiling all the same. For the first time it struck Harry that maybe Hermione <em>minded</em> the fact she had never really clicked with the Gryffindor girls. In fact\u2026 as far as Harry knew, she had never had a female friend in all the years they\u2019d been at Hogwarts.</p>\n<p>Why had this never occurred to him? He\u2019d always presumed that he and Ron were enough for her. But now, when he saw her face lit up with interest as she helped Mandy charm the flasks to protect them against damage, talking all the time about the likely results of their tests\u2026 he felt a bit of a dick for never thinking about it before.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you later, Mandy,\u201d Hermione said, still looking pink and pleased. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk with Ron and Harry for a bit now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLisa, Daphne and Millie are going to the library after lunch to do their Potions essay. Do you want to come?\u201d Mandy hoisted her satchel over her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun working together, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it really is. I\u2019ll definitely be there later.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Mandy was out of earshot, Ron poked Hermione in the ribs. \u201cYou don\u2019t need encouraging to study <em>more</em>,\u201d he teased. \u201cI bet those Slytherin girls only want to copy your homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione shook her head. \u201cDaphne\u2019s top of her House in Potions, actually. It\u2019s just nice to have company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve got our company for a while.\u201d Ron wrapped his arm around her and kissed the top of her hair.</p>\n<p>She snuggled into Ron\u2019s arm as they walked, looking contented. \u201cWhat have you two been up to? How are things with Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry had a vivid flash of himself last night, silently wanking while listening to Malfoy doing the same. He coughed. \u201cBit bloody weird,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt must be,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cOh well, I guess you can stay out of his way most of the time. Does he say much?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yeah, he told me he\u2019s just as good at wanking with his left hand as with his right.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Harry told her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHonestly, what would someone like Malfoy have to say to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione sighed. \u201cAre you sleeping any better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr. Maybe?\u201d Harry said. Well. It was nowhere near as bad as it had been straight after the battle, so it wasn\u2019t exactly a lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still look tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m OK. I\u2019ll have an early night.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Malfoy got into bed and it wasn\u2019t Harry\u2019s fault that everything sounded so loud. He could hear Malfoy rustling, could imagine him getting comfortable and then easing his pyjamas down, just low enough to\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do you want me to pretend I\u2019m not doing this, so you can pretend you\u2019re not listening?\u201d Malfoy asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what the fuck you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOK, I will. But do I have to pretend I can\u2019t hear you, either?\u201d Malfoy snickered to himself. \u201cI know. Let\u2019s pretend we don\u2019t have dicks at all. Would that make you feel more comfortable?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry knew he should just ignore Malfoy. The more Harry protested, the more he showed that it was bothering him. But\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m perfectly OK with the fact I have a dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s just me that has to pretend I don\u2019t? Oh, right. I get it. Well, you can rest easy. There are no dicks over here, Potter.\u201d Malfoy shifted on the bed and let out a small sigh. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have an erection right this minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin. Malfoy was bloody impossible. Making it sound like Harry was the one with the problem. Thank god it was dark so that he couldn\u2019t see Harry\u2019s cheeks burning. But Malfoy genuinely seemed to think it was quite normal, what they had done last night. Perhaps it <em>was</em> normal? Perhaps Ron was doing the same thing every night with Stephen Cornfoot. Perhaps everyone at Hogwarts had been masturbating together since the time of the Founders, and Harry was the only one who hadn\u2019t known about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely not \u2013 <em>uh</em> \u2013 touching myself right now.\u201d Malfoy went on. \u201cThat would be terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck\u2019s sake</em>. Harry\u2019s cock didn\u2019t seem to think it was terrible. Not at all. Harry\u2019s cock thought it was bloody <em>brilliant</em>, and it wanted to know why Harry was wasting all this time instead of joining in.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor goodness sakes, don\u2019t get carried away and get a hard-on, Potter. The wizarding world as we know it will literally crumble around our ears if you have a quick wank at bedtime when someone else might hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hell. The thing was \u2013 Harry was hard now. It was only because Malfoy kept <em>talking</em> about it. He hadn\u2019t been hard when he got into bed. Well, not completely. If Harry didn\u2019t wank now, he would just have to wait for Malfoy to go to sleep so that he could do it later. And Malfoy didn\u2019t care. In fact, Malfoy was going to think Harry <em>was</em> doing it, even if he wasn\u2019t. So it seemed stupid to make himself wait, to stay awake for ages when he could just do it now and then have a good chance of getting to sleep.</p>\n<p>Harry gently wriggled out of his pyjama bottoms and started to stroke himself. He was quick and efficient. He came just before Malfoy and cleaned himself up without making a sound while Malfoy muttered his way through his own spells. And when Malfoy said \u201cSleep well,\u201d snide as anything, Harry maintained a dignified silence.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was still bloody weird, this business of Malfoy sauntering out of the bathroom with his shirt undone every morning. He always sat on the bed to do up the buttons and fasten his tie. It made Harry feel sort of flustered, and sitting in silence while he did it was even weirder, so it seemed best to make some kind of conversation. Harry leapt on the first topic that came into his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Goyle, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked up, his face cold. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with him? Oh, I dunno, Potter. Maybe the fact he saw his best friend burn to death last year? Maybe the fact his parents are in Azkaban, do you think that might be a little bit of a problem for him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry clenched his teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s lost people. And in case you forgot, Crabbe was trying to murder me and the others when he died.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy finished his buttons and reached for his tie, his face screwing up. \u201cHe was a crazy bastard at the end. All twisted up with hatred.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou encouraged him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy narrowed his eyes. \u201cNot to kill. I was shouting at him to stop\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot then. I mean all your Pureblood crap. That\u2019s what killed him. Nearly killed us all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m the one who has to live with that, you righteous fucking wanker.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s face looked as if it would twist up in a sneer, but at the last moment, he couldn\u2019t quite manage it. Instead he just sat there looking miserable and angry, his tie hanging loose around his neck.</p>\n<p>Harry let out an uneven breath. He could feel a muscle jumping at his temple, and a familiar rage simmering in his chest, but he was so tired of all this and he didn\u2019t want to fight any more. Not right now. It was hopeless to think he and Malfoy could discuss that sort of thing. But still, he couldn't help wondering... \u201cSo who is Goyle sharing with, anyway?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked up, surprised, as if he had forgotten what they were talking about. \u201cGreg?\u201d He snorted. \u201cSome bloody Hufflepuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNo. Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Malfoy. He attempted a faint smile. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to be a fly on the wall in their room?\u201d He stared into the middle distance. \u201cMind you. Greg is\u2026 rather a sweet bloke sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was sure he looked as sceptical as he felt. \u201cErr. Are you serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, in his own way.\u201d Malfoy qualified. He met Harry\u2019s gaze again, and his eyes had just a hint of amusement. \u201cMaybe the Hufflepuffs will adopt him as one of their own?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Harry\u2019s turn to snort. \u201cYeah, maybe. Hermione\u2019s fitting right in with the Ravenclaws.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought she was sharing with Millie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, she is. I think she\u2019s just making some new friends, you know? About time, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy grunted. \u201cPoor woman. All those years of putting up with Weasley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d Harry felt the anger stir again. \u201cNo slagging off my friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, but it\u2019s OK for you to insult mine?\u201d</p>\n<p>The words, <em>That\u2019s different</em> sprang to Harry\u2019s lips, but he bit them back with an effort. \u201cOK,\u201d he said, his brows drawing down. \u201cI won\u2019t if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Malfoy stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>After lunch, Harry went to the library, but it seemed like everyone else had the same idea for once and he couldn\u2019t find a free table. He checked out the book he was working from, a big old volume on the history of Magizoology, and a tiny one which he could hardly read from, the writing all cramped and scratchy, and took the stairs to the room he shared with Malfoy.</p>\n<p>The door swung open to reveal Malfoy with his back to Harry, shirtless and apparently changing out of his uniform. He looked over his shoulder at Harry as he came in, but didn\u2019t speak or acknowledge him, just carried on unfastening his belt and then shucked off his trousers in one fluid movement.</p>\n<p>Harry froze, standing by the door. He couldn\u2019t even remember why he had come up to the room, let alone think what to do next. Malfoy simply stood there, in a pair of snug-fitting boxers and nothing else, hanging up his robes so they didn\u2019t crease.</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI.\u201d He looked down at the books in his arms and it came back to him just in time. \u201cI came up to do some work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Right,\u201d said Malfoy, sounding uninterested, and rather as if he wondered why Harry was telling him this. \u201cI\u2019m going into Hogsmeade.\u201d Malfoy turned to his trunk and bent over, rummaging through the contents, and Harry found himself staring, fascinated by the delicate ridges of Malfoy\u2019s spine. The neat sweep of his waist and\u2014 <em>Fuck</em>. The tight curve of his arse under white cotton.</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked around again and Harry quickly moved, went to put the books down on the desk and then walked around it to sit down. He couldn\u2019t help it if this meant he was still facing Malfoy, and when Malfoy straightened up and started to pull a soft woollen jumper over his head, all of the muscles in his back tightening, his ribs shifting under the skin, Harry pushed the desk away from him in his hurry to get up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cForgot something,\u201d Harry said, and was back out of the door and into the corridor, something loud and startling rushing in his ears.</p>\n<p>When he went back, ten minutes later, a hot, shaky feeling still pulsing through him, Malfoy was gone, and there was only a hint of ginger in the air.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>The bathroom light was still on. Malfoy had showered before bed and Harry was going to mention when he came out that he\u2019d left the light on, but he didn\u2019t, because he was too busy thinking about whether Malfoy showering before bed meant that he had already had a wank while he was in the shower. And if so, what Harry should do next, because he was hard already, and his body seemed to think it was <em>owed</em> a wank, as though doing it two nights in a row meant that he had a commitment to <em>always</em> wanking at this time of night for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>So Harry was lying there, sort of expectant, and if he were being honest, hopeful. He hadn\u2019t started touching himself, but he definitely wanted to. When Malfoy got under the sheets and started to move in that slow, deliberate way, started to make those soft noises, Harry guessed that he probably hadn\u2019t wanked in the shower and that it was going to be OK for Harry to wank too. He nearly mentioned the light then \u2013 they never usually left it on when they went to bed \u2013 but then he realised that if he kept quiet, he might be able to see what was happening. Just a little bit. It felt wrong to be thinking that way, but there was also a heavy kind of thrill coiling in his stomach, and it didn\u2019t seem like Harry cared very much about what was right and what was wrong at that exact moment.</p>\n<p>The bathroom door was only open a crack, but Harry could see that Malfoy had got comfortable on the bed with one of his legs stretched right out, dangling over the edge of the bed, and that Malfoy\u2019s head was sort of tilted back. Harry hadn\u2019t even touched his cock yet, but it was already straining against his pyjama bottoms, and Harry slid his hand inside to wrap around the hot, sticky-smooth length of his erection.</p>\n<p>Malfoy made noises, again, quietly at first, and then a shivery low moan that made Harry\u2019s cock leap eagerly in his hand. He kept his eyes half-closed in the hope that Malfoy couldn\u2019t tell whether he was looking or not, but Malfoy didn\u2019t seem to be paying much attention to Harry. Maybe he didn\u2019t even care if Harry was watching? Malfoy had one knee up, his legs wide apart, and Harry thought he could even see the movement of Malfoy\u2019s hand under the covers, moving steadily over his cock. Harry found himself unconsciously matching Malfoy\u2019s rhythm, pushing into his own hand and wondering if it felt as good for Malfoy right now as it did for Harry, a shuddery slow build of pleasure which threatened to spill over at any moment.</p>\n<p>Harry had to hold back, though, after only about a minute, because he was getting really close, and he didn\u2019t want to be the first to come and have Malfoy <em>laugh</em>, or something\u2026 He gripped the base of his cock and waited for the urge to die down. Then Malfoy made a harsh sound, his mouth fell open, and his head tipped right back, and he was gasping and moving his hips, and, <em>oh fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry came pretty much immediately after. He didn\u2019t mean to be loud like that, but somehow he couldn\u2019t help it.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>The next day in Charms, Harry struggled to stay focused. They were working on an advanced Concealment Charm and he could see he wasn\u2019t the only one having difficulty \u2013 Malfoy was two desks down, frowning at the coins they\u2019d each been given to practise on.</p>\n<p>Hermione nudged him. \u201dWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sleeping any better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr. Kind of?\u201d Harry said. He usually said he was whenever Hermione asked. She looked so worried otherwise. But now he thought about it\u2026 \u201cActually, yeah. Quite a lot better, in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look all dopey, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m OK. I\u2019ll have an early night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes wandered over to Malfoy again. The other boy let out a little grunt of frustration as he tried and failed to make the Knuts disappear, and Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking of the sounds Malfoy had made last night. The sounds he might make again tonight. If, you know, it happened again tonight. It might not. It wasn\u2019t like they had a <em>routine</em> going or anything, after all. He looked at the twin creases between Malfoy\u2019s eyebrows, the way he sucked in his bottom lip as he prepared to cast again, and wondered if this was the same way Malfoy looked when he was coming.</p>\n<p>Then Hermione elbowed Harry gently, making a wry, <em>What is wrong with you today?</em> face. Merlin, what <em>was</em> wrong with him? Just because he and Malfoy had to share a room now, it didn\u2019t mean Harry had to get all <em>funny</em> about him. He went back to practising on the little heap of Knuts with a guilty conscience.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>That night, Harry was brushing his teeth, like he did every night, and then when he came to bed, he forgot to turn the bathroom light off and shut the door. That was all it was. He didn\u2019t mean to leave a triangle of gold slanting over Malfoy\u2019s bed, illuminating everything in its path. He just forgot to turn off the light, and Malfoy didn\u2019t mention it, but when Harry lay down and rolled over to face Malfoy\u2019s bed, Malfoy had a knowing look on his face.</p>\n<p><em>What?</em> Harry wanted to ask, but he was pretty sure he knew what, and decided to keep his mouth shut instead.</p>\n<p>The door was open much wider than the previous night, light streaming in, so when Malfoy tucked one hand beneath his head and let the other slide down under the covers, Harry could see it all quite clearly. Malfoy\u2019s eyes were resting on him, the lids half-shut. Harry wasn\u2019t sure, but he thought he could tell the moment that Malfoy first touched himself \u2013 the way he bit down on the fullness of his bottom lip, and arched up a little, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of whatever was going on under the covers.</p>\n<p>God, this felt weird, watching someone else wank. But weird in a very, very good way. Hot shivers rippled through Harry as Malfoy closed his eyes and let out one of the small sounds Harry was starting to know quite well. He could see the movement under the covers, see the tension in Malfoy\u2019s jaw as he worked his hand back and forth. And then Harry was touching himself, too. Stroking his cock, slowly at first, then faster, while he watched Malfoy do the same, and all Harry could think was that he wished Malfoy wasn\u2019t under the covers like that.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s legs shifted, his body angling towards Harry, and Harry imagined the view he\u2019d be getting right now if Malfoy pulled the blankets back. His own thumb swiped over the head of his cock and he gasped, his body jerking.</p>\n<p>It would just be <em>interesting</em>, that was all. It wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever seen before, someone doing that. He\u2019d like to see if Malfoy did it the same way as Harry \u2013 he probably had some fancy technique or something. How would Harry know, if he couldn\u2019t see? That was all he wanted. It wasn\u2019t because he was into boys or anything. He\u2019d never even thought about it, not until he had to share the room and Malfoy started wanking all the bloody time and practically shoving his dick in Harry\u2019s face. Harry had never been the slightest bit interested, not before now. Not before he\u2019d seen Malfoy\u2019s eyes screw up and his mouth fall open, heard him make that little choking cry that meant he was getting close.</p>\n<p>Harry thought about turning away. He didn\u2019t have to look any more \u2013 he could just quickly get himself off with his eyes closed and then go to sleep. But the breathless, reckless feeling that swarmed through him as he thrust into his own hand said otherwise. His eyes burned with looking, and the longing to see more built inside him until he thought he would go mad. Malfoy shifted on the bed again, one knee drawing right up, and, <em>holy shit</em>, the covers slipped a little and Harry could see Malfoy\u2019s bare leg, and his arm, his wanking arm, moving, oh god, moving in firm, slow strokes.</p>\n<p>Harry choked back a whimper and felt his own prick leap in his palm. He couldn\u2019t see Malfoy\u2019s cock. But if he sat up, bloody hell, if he sat up, he would see it. Or if Malfoy turned a little, if he just rolled over a bit further, the covers would slip right off. Harry was leaking pre-come all over his hand and he felt his balls drawing up, pleasure coiling tight and ready to release. He tried to hold on. Tried not to come yet. Because if he waited, just another minute, Malfoy might move and then Harry would see\u2026 It was only curiosity, that was all. Harry just wanted to know how <em>big</em> Malfoy was, just out of interest...</p>\n<p>Malfoy let out a low throaty moan and then stilled. It looked as if his leg was trembling a little, his body held taut as if right on the edge. Another sound bubbled up from his chest, but still he didn\u2019t move, except to throw his arm over his head to grip one of the bedposts. His eyes were tightly shut, and oh god, was Malfoy <em>teasing</em> himself? Harry stuffed a fist against his own mouth, because he was going to come, any second, and it was going to be fucking loud, he could feel it. Holy fucking Merlin, he could feel it, and Malfoy started moving again, and he wasn\u2019t exactly being quiet himself. Harry\u2019s orgasm ripped through him, fierce and fiery. He bucked into his own hand, biting on his fist, trying and failing to be quiet, while a string of filthy sounds spilled from Malfoy\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Harry lay there, limp and out of breath. Bloody hell, that had been intense. He felt shame pricking hotly at his cheeks at how carried away he had been, at the noises that had escaped from around his knuckles. He couldn\u2019t look at Malfoy, but he could see from the corner of his eye that he had pulled the sheet over himself again and was lying flat on his back. Harry was hoping they would just go to sleep, and never mention this again, when Malfoy spoke softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to try and keep quiet, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry lay staring at the ceiling, his ears burning with embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s as though you feel like you shouldn\u2019t be enjoying it.\u201d Malfoy made a snorting sound, and Harry wanted to hit him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the bloody point of doing it if you don\u2019t let yourself have a good time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. It\u2019s not that.\u201d Harry tried to swallow around the lump of discomfort in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, then? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOK, I know we both do it, yeah? But maybe you don\u2019t want to hear me. Maybe I don\u2019t want to hear <em>you</em>.\u201d Well, that was a whopping lie. Harry had definitely wanted to hear Malfoy, every breath and sigh. He didn\u2019t want to admit that part of him was still wishing he had found a way to get a better look at what Malfoy had been doing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a load of shit.\u201d Malfoy sounded annoyed. \u201cIf I\u2019m getting off, why wouldn\u2019t I want to hear someone else enjoying themselves, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned into the darkness. The thing was, it did make sense when Malfoy put it that way. But\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou liked it, Potter. You know you liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry did look at him then, to try and work out why Malfoy was saying that, whether he was just trying to rile Harry, or what. Malfoy was lying on his back with his arms behind his head, looking completely self-satisfied.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou liked it,\u201d Malfoy said again. \u201cAnd I liked it, too. Why pretend otherwise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry groped under the pillow for his wand and flicked off the bathroom light, but even when he couldn\u2019t see Malfoy, he still felt churned up with the awkwardness of the situation. \u201cForgot to do that earlier,\u201d Harry said, trying to sound casual.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Irritation flared in Harry\u2019s chest. \u201cCan you shut up now so I can get some sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t answer, but Harry could still feel his smug amusement in the silent darkness.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry hurried up the stairs to their room. He\u2019d downed a pint of pumpkin juice at lunch and now he was bursting for a piss. Malfoy wasn\u2019t there. He unzipped as he crossed the room, flipped the bathroom door open, and\u2014</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was already in the bathroom. Malfoy was already in the bathroom, standing, <em>bollock naked</em>, with one leg up on the bathtub, drying himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit!\u201d Harry blurted. Malfoy looked surprised, but made no move to cover himself. His body was skinny, but not as skinny as Harry would have expected \u2013 it was lean and strong, and, Merlin, there was so much pale, smooth skin. It went on and on, broken only by Malfoy\u2019s Dark Mark, standing out on his arm like a violation.</p>\n<p>But even the Dark Mark couldn\u2019t take Harry\u2019s attention away from Malfoy\u2019s prick. It hung, soft and heavy, surrounded by blond curls, his neat, firm balls below, and fucking hell, Harry was staring like a brainless fool.</p>\n<p>Harry turned around and walked out, slamming the door behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter?\u201d Malfoy called. Shit, he sounded like he thought it was pretty funny. \u201cDid you want something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said hoarsely. Ugh, his flies were still undone. He zipped up, his hands unsteady, then cleared his throat and pitched his voice lower. \u201cJust needed a piss. Didn\u2019t know you were in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could always knock next time, if you don\u2019t want an eyeful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry could hear the bastard smiling. Could picture him, clearly, Malfoy\u2019s cock jiggling slightly as he resumed drying himself. Lean muscle and a lightly-curved arse, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cLock the door in future, OK?\u201d Harry told him. <em>Fucking great</em>. Now he was half-hard, as well as still needing the loo. He went to adjust himself in his trousers, then snatched his hand away as the bathroom door opened and Malfoy came out, the towel slung low on his hips. Harry turned away, but not before his eyes had travelled over sleek damp hair combed back from Malfoy\u2019s sharp face. Small pink nipples. The taut dip of his navel.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stood staring out of the window, as if there was something really interesting happening out there. There might be, for all he knew. He could only see acres of pale skin and jutting hipbones.</p>\n<p>\u201cBathroom\u2019s free,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Right,\u201d said Harry. He wasn\u2019t sure if his semi was obvious in these trousers or not, but there was no way he could check. He was just going to have to brazen it out.</p>\n<p>He turned without meeting Malfoy\u2019s eye and walked to the bathroom as much aplomb as he could manage. Safely inside, with the door firmly <em>locked</em>, he ran the tap and splashed cold water onto his face. What was <em>wrong</em> with him? He\u2019d seen blokes in the shower before. Loads of times. Just because it was Malfoy. Just because he knew what Malfoy sounded like \u2013 knew what he <em>looked</em> like \u2013 when he was coming. Why did that mean he had to get all weird about seeing Malfoy naked?</p>\n<p>As he stood over the toilet, dick out (now <em>more</em> than half hard, thanks to the way it leapt with delight as soon as Harry had begun to unzip), desperately trying to piss, he was sure of only one thing. He definitely wasn\u2019t going to leave the light on again tonight. It was far too confusing.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was maybe a bit cold to sit by the Lake, but it had become a habit for some of the eighth years to head out there before dinner each night as dusk started to fall. Tonight there were about a dozen students sitting on rugs, chatting and watching the Giant Squid catching Grindylows and tossing them from tentacle to tentacle. Harry wandered over to where Hermione was sitting with a group of eighth year girls, her hands clasped around a steaming mug of something. \u201cHot chocolate?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, no.\u201d The tip of Hermione\u2019s nose was a lovely pink colour. \u201cIt\u2019s tea with rum, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right. Is it some kind of party? You\u2019re not spending the evening at the library, as usual?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione frowned. \u201cOf course I am, I\u2019ve got loads to do. But we came out for a quick break. The tea is just to keep warm.\u201d She smiled shyly, looking over her shoulder at the other girls. \u201cIt was Millicent\u2019s idea, and I have to say it\u2019s quite delicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry raised an eyebrow and grinned. It was lovely to see Hermione looking relaxed. He\u2019d thought she was going to lose her marbles at first, trying to get a whole term\u2019s work done in a week and confiding to anyone who would listen that she was \u201cgetting awfully behind already\u201d.</p>\n<p>Harry said hi to Padma and Katie as they joined the group, then felt himself go strangely still at the sight of three Slytherin boys strolling towards the Lake. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him. There was absolutely no need to feel all jittery like this in his chest just because Draco Malfoy was walking past. Malfoy had left his robes at the Castle, and was wearing the standard uniform trousers and jumper like everyone else, but, god, he looked good in them. Like a fucking model or something with his slender frame and that haughty walk of his.</p>\n<p>As Malfoy walked past with Goyle, he nodded in Harry\u2019s direction, and his lips twitched into a kind of smile \u2013 well, more like a <em>smirk</em>, to be honest, but it had the horrifying effect of sending a deep shiver of interest along Harry\u2019s spine. Hermione was still sitting right there, and Harry desperately tried to keep his face from showing anything unusual, but he suspected it wasn\u2019t working out. He cleared his throat, which only made Hermione look concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you getting a cold? Do you want some of this tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Thanks. I\u2019m fine.\u201d If he had a drink every time Malfoy unsettled him, he\u2019d be an alcoholic by Christmas. Malfoy kept walking, all swanky and fascinating. Harry tried not to watch, but it was too late; his cock was stirring in his pants, apparently eager to show its approval at the mere existence of Malfoy. Harry stuck his hands in his pockets to disguise the bulge, and hoped it just looked as if he was cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all sitting out here again?\u201d Ron sounded fed up. \u201cI can never find you these days, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust having a break from schoolwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s bloody freezing and there\u2019s a perfectly good castle over there. Anyway, why don\u2019t you come and find <em>me</em> when you want a break?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione flushed and got to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk, then. You too, Harry.\u201d She put down her tea and linked arms with Ron. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so <em>rude</em> about it,\u201d she whispered, then looked round at the other girls. \u201cI\u2019ll see you back in the library in a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, Granger!\u201d someone called after them. \u201cWhere are you taking those two? Don\u2019t do anything we wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d There was some snickering, and Ron increased his pace, his long legs striding along and making the other two hurry to keep up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you want to hang around with that lot?\u201d he said sulkily.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re all right.\u201d Hermione frowned. \u201cDaphne\u2019s quite nice, and I like Mandy a lot. I\u2019m still getting to know the others. It\u2019ll take time, I expect, but at least I\u2019m trying, unlike some people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re sharing with Bulstrode, doesn\u2019t mean you have to be all pally with her and her gang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a <em>gang</em>,\u201d Hermione said crossly. \u201cHalf of the Slytherin girls didn\u2019t even come back this year; Millicent\u2019s best friend has gone to France. Some of us are just trying to get along with the others left at Hogwarts. This tradition of splitting people into Houses is very divisive, you know, I\u2019ve been drafting a letter to the Governors about it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you even find time for stuff like that?\u201d Ron shook his head. \u201cI swear the Professors are having a competition to see who can give the most homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink about it, though,\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cMost people have traits from more than one house, anyway; sorting us arbitrarily when we\u2019re eleven years old is an archaic system with no real benefits. I\u2019ve been reading a lot of Muggle history lately. Looking at how conflicts arise and how those in power often set one group of people against another and use it to their advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry met Ron\u2019s eye. \u201cYou\u2019ve started her off now, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can laugh, but this is important. If we\u2019re going to prevent more wars in the future, we need unity, not separation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stopped for a minute and gazed out over the lake. You could see the white tomb from where they stood, the moonlight softening its stark outline, and he let out a long breath. \u201cAll right. I'm not laughing, and I know what you\u2019re getting at.\u201d He looked round at Hermione. \u201cIn fact\u2026 I don\u2019t think I ever told you this. But the Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin to start with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron gaped. \u201cYou are kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI asked it not to, and... well, you know the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron whistled. Hermione flushed a little and thrust her hands deep into her pockets. \u201cWell, if we\u2019re coming clean\u2026\u201d She glanced between the two of them. \u201cThe hat was fairly determined that I belonged in Ravenclaw. But I was ready for that, and I\u2019d prepared a list of reasons why Gryffindor would suit me much better. It soon gave up arguing.\u201d She smiled to herself.</p>\n<p>Harry burst out laughing. \u201cThat has to be the most Ravenclaw way of <em>not</em> being Sorted into Ravenclaw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt worked, though.\u201d Hermione lifted her chin, looking satisfied.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Ron said. \u201cIf this is where I\u2019m meant to break down in tears and admit I\u2019m actually a Hufflepuff, you can forget about it. Come on, it's too cool to hang around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>They walked on, past Hagrid\u2019s hut and to the edge of the Forbidden Forest before looping around back towards the castle.</p>\n<p>\n<em> <em>\u201cAll right. Say putting everyone into Houses does have its drawbacks,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWhat about forcing us to share with people we\u2019ve got absolutely nothing in common with? That\u2019s not going to help anybody.\u201d</em> </em>\n</p>\n<p>Hermione spoke seriously. \u201cNo, listen. I think they chose the people we were sharing with very carefully. People who could offer us a different view on things. You know, who we could learn something from. Or who would give us something that we need.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something that we need. Harry didn\u2019t know why those words tugged at him like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to be honest, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s working for me.\u201d Ron shook his head.</p>\n<p>Hermione made a face. \u201cYou haven\u2019t given it a chance!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I could have learned something from Stephen if I didn\u2019t already know Ravenclaws were boring bastards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! That\u2019s so unfair, Ron, and not in the least bit true, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron put up a hand. \u201cSorry, sorry. It was just a joke. He\u2019s OK, I suppose. But what about Harry, then? Eh? What\u2019s he supposed to learn from sharing with bloody Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry could think of a few things. <em>That Malfoy really likes wanking?</em></p>\n<p>Or that Harry was pretty keen on it, too. Ron probably didn\u2019t want to hear about that, though.</p>\n<p>What about the fact that Harry now had a fairly good idea he liked looking at blokes? Well, looking at Malfoy, anyway. Malfoy, all pale and bare and snooty. That was a pretty major thing to learn, in his opinion, but he didn\u2019t imagine it was precisely what McGonagall had had in mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink about it, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cThe Wizarding world has been this way for centuries, more or less. Maybe it\u2019s time it has to change.\u201d</p>\n<p>They walked back to the castle in silence, Ron\u2019s arm thrown over Hermione\u2019s shoulder, each of them occupied with their own thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Nothing weird was going to happen tonight. Harry had made sure he used the bathroom after Malfoy was finished, and he turned the light out, like they had always done before\u2026 <em>before</em>. Malfoy was reading a book by the light of his wand, but Harry knew he would turn that out in a few minutes, and then they could both have a perfectly normal wank, in the dark, and everything would be fine.</p>\n<p>Harry wasn\u2019t wanking yet. He was just getting comfortable under the covers. He was waiting for Malfoy to cast <em>Nox</em> before he started wanking, but in the meantime, he was just getting <em>ready</em>. His pyjamas were down around his thighs, and, well, his cock was pretty hard, but he wasn\u2019t wanking. He was just\u2026 adjusting his balls. It felt much better now he\u2019d moved them like that. And his foreskin\u2026 yes, that was perfect.</p>\n<p>Malfoy glanced over. \u201cEager tonight, Potter.\u201d Harry could see his sharp face glowing by the light of the Lumos.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry stuttered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell you what\u2026 why don\u2019t you come over here?\u201d Malfoy asked, and Harry choked on his lungful of air.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just thinking.\u201d Malfoy spoke with careful nonchalance. \u201cYou could always come over here. You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry <em>didn\u2019t</em> know. What the fuck did he mean, come over there. Like, to his bed? Come over to where Malfoy was? And then\u2026.? Harry\u2019s brain seized up before he could even finish the thought.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was acting as if he was saying something perfectly reasonable. \u201cIt would make sense. I mean, we both want to get off. So, we might as well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s throat made a weird sound that wasn\u2019t anything approaching speech. He tried again and managed, \u201cUh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just thought you might like to try it. You know, if you\u2019ve never\u2026 with anyone else. Sounds like the Gryffindor dorm was a fuck of a lot more boring than the Slytherin dorm, after lights out.\u201d Malfoy let out a snorting kind of laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI. I don\u2019t. Uhh.\u201d Harry fumbled for words. \u201cFucking hell, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, forget it. It\u2019s not like I care either way.\u201d But Malfoy sounded like he did care. Just a little bit. \u201cYou can remain hopelessly clueless. I was only trying to do you a favour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on. I\u2019m not <em>clueless</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, Potter. Stay over there and have a nice wholesome wank, thinking about your future wife and how she\u2019ll bake bread every morning while tending your adorable children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think about <em>that</em>, you tosser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Nor do I. Now why don\u2019t we both shut up so we can get on with whatever it is we <em>do</em> think about?\u201d Malfoy muttered <em>Nox</em>, low and irritable, and the room plunged into darkness.</p>\n<p>Harry lay stunned for a moment. What was it he normally thought about? Well, Malfoy, of course. Malfoy, touching himself. He thought about what Malfoy looked like. He might have even wondered what Malfoy would <em>feel</em> like. And now Malfoy had offered, actually offered, and Harry had said\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Malfoy was not impressed. \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was easier in the dark, without Malfoy\u2019s silvery eyes on him. \u201cMaybe\u2026 maybe I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s voice was hesitant. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t believe he was saying it, but\u2014 \u201cMaybe I do want to come over there.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a pause, then Malfoy said, a little breathlessly, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wet his lips. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Harry could hear Malfoy swallowing in the darkness. \u201cGet over here, then, Potter.\u201d There was a rustling and a creaking, presumably as Malfoy moved over on the bed.</p>\n<p>Harry swung his feet onto the floor. Merlin, his pyjamas were still at half mast. He yanked them up and hurried over to the other bed. It was cold, and, well, he didn\u2019t want anyone to have time to have second thoughts.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have a clue what to do when he got there, but Malfoy lifted the covers and whispered, \u201cGet in.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>. Harry scrambled onto the bed and, hell, those were Malfoy\u2019s bare legs, right there, closer than he\u2019d been expecting. He pulled away, kind of shocked, and Malfoy let out another snort-laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese beds are tiny.\u201d Harry slid down under the covers and tried not to do anything too stupid. Malfoy\u2019s knee bumped into Harry\u2019s, cold and a bit bony, and Harry made a hiccuping kind of noise of surprise, and then they both laughed, together this time, and when they stopped, there was a kind of expectant silence.</p>\n<p>Harry let his legs slide down against Malfoy\u2019s, as if he was just getting comfortable, but Malfoy let out a small sound and shifted on the bed, so that their hips brushed together for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>They spoke together and broke off at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start off how you normally do?\u201d Malfoy said, his voice softer and more persuasive than Harry had ever heard it before.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr. OK.\u201d Harry\u2019s heart was jittering in his chest, but his erection was rock solid. He let his hand slip inside his pyjamas, wrapped his fingers around it and started to stroke.</p>\n<p>Hell. It was so strange, but also thrilling. Malfoy was <em>right there</em>, and Harry was actually <em>in bed</em> next to him, with the smell of Malfoy\u2019s cologne and the scent of his skin all around him. It was like ginger and oranges \u2013 Malfoy smelled mouthwatering. Harry stifled a small moan and slowed the movement of his hand. He was far too worked up already. Apparently his cock really, really liked Malfoy being this close to him. But he had no idea what was actually going on. Was he allowed to touch Malfoy? Was that something that could happen? Or were they just going to lie here and do it like this, side by side?</p>\n<p>Malfoy shifted his legs against Harry\u2019s again, and Harry felt sweat break out on his top lip. Malfoy didn\u2019t seem to have any pyjama bottoms on, and Harry wasn\u2019t sure if he was wearing pants or not.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re really warm,\u201d Malfoy said with approval.</p>\n<p>Harry laughed shakily, then asked, \u201cAre you going to\u2026 you know? Do yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy shifted against him again and said, \u201cMmm. Yep.\u201d But Malfoy\u2019s hand trailed across Harry\u2019s hip, and then he tugged at Harry\u2019s pyjama trousers. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take these off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s chest felt tight with nerves, but he stripped off the loose trousers until his cock sprang free, straining up against Malfoy\u2019s cool sheets.</p>\n<p>\u201cHas anyone else ever touched you?\u201d Malfoy asked, close to his ear, and Harry thought he could feel his breath, warm and damp. \u201cI mean\u2026 your cock?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry never talked about this stuff. Well, it wasn\u2019t as if he was going to discuss what he and Ginny had got up to with <em>Ron</em>, was it? And Hermione\u2026 he could tell her anything, but somehow he didn\u2019t think she wanted to hear about this. It was private, anyway. But\u2026 it seemed ridiculous to pretend it was too personal to talk about when he was in Malfoy\u2019s bed, with Malfoy\u2019s hand a few inches from his erection. \u201cNot really,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI mean\u2026 no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t? Not ever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d It wasn\u2019t <em>that</em> unusual, surely? Although Malfoy sounded like he could hardly believe it.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>.\u201d Malfoy sounded breathless again. His fingers brushed Harry\u2019s hip, this time finding bare skin. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2013 Uh.\u201d Harry\u2019s skin was alive with trails of heat, everywhere Malfoy touched. \u201cIt never seemed like the right time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s hand edged under Harry\u2019s pyjama top, pushing it out of the way and splaying his hand over Harry\u2019s stomach. \u201cAny time is the right time, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but. Ginny was\u2013 she was quite young when we got together, you know?\u201d Harry went on.</p>\n<p><em>And I thought I was going to die</em>. He didn\u2019t say that bit out loud.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s cool fingers were travelling over his skin. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it any more right now,\u201d Harry gritted out, trying not to moan at the pure pleasure, sparking hot and bright.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Malfoy agreed, and shifted on the bed so that the sudden, shocking, smooth-hardness of Malfoy\u2019s erection nudged against Harry\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d Harry said. He felt his own cock leak against his stomach, then Malfoy\u2019s hand skimmed over his navel, and he knew Malfoy would be feeling it too, the slippery trail of pre-come. Malfoy\u2019s breath caught in his throat, a little stuttery inhale, then his fingers brushed across Harry\u2019s shaft and Harry bucked wildly into his touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Harry said, and Malfoy\u2019s hand froze. \u201cNo. I mean \u2013 don\u2019t stop, god, I mean, I just\u2014 \u201c</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s fingers skimmed over the head of Harry\u2019s cock and Harry forgot how to speak. How to <em>breathe</em>. \u201c<em>Uhhhh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was like, <em>fuck</em>, it was so intense, like the first time Harry had ever masturbated. He didn\u2019t know how to handle the shocks of sensation, the almost frightening bliss of Malfoy\u2019s hand wrapped around him. \u201c<em>Uhhhh\u2026. </em>Fuck,\u201d Harry said, and grabbed at Malfoy, blindly, his hands meeting smooth, warm, firm skin and just the feel of Malfoy\u2019s body against the pads of his fingers, just the smell of him, made Harry feel like he was coming apart. Malfoy was breathing fast, his hand working Harry\u2019s foreskin slick and sure, so much better than Harry doing it himself. So good, so insanely good, and when Malfoy tightened his grip and worked him right down to the root, Harry let out a long moan and came all over Malfoy\u2019s fucking fist, long spurts of it, making Harry shake with the blistering sweetness of it.</p>\n<p><em> Oh</em>. The whole thing had taken less than a minute. Maybe thirty seconds. Harry felt hot shame flooding in, washing away the relief he had felt moments before.</p>\n<p>But Malfoy didn\u2019t seem bothered in the least. His hard-on was still pushing against Harry\u2019s leg, and his hand shook a little as he wiped it on the sheets. He made a noise something like a laugh, but he sounded pleased, not scornful. Maybe he was just pleased because Harry had just made such a fool of himself?</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say that wasn\u2019t completely idiotic. <em>It was just so good. In fact, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to my cock.</em> He felt his throat burn with the humiliation of it.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s voice was hoarse and urgent. \u201cGod, yes. Now do it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...\u201d Harry was going to say that he didn\u2019t know how, but bloody hell, if he couldn\u2019t work out how to give a hand job, then he really was a useless tosser.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s hand groped towards him in the dark and found the arresting length of Malfoy\u2019s prick. God, that was the strangest thing \u2013 to feel another cock in his hand instead of his own. It was similar and yet so different, and he couldn\u2019t quite believe this was happening. At first he felt awkward, his wrist twisted uncomfortably, but then he changed the angle and, wow, it fitted into his palm, just so. It was so hard, pulsing with heat and life, and as he tentatively slid his hand along the shaft, it jerked, once, twice. Malfoy made a low desperate noise and bloody hell. <em>Bloody hell</em>. Harry felt mad shivers of excitement race through him. He was holding Malfoy\u2019s cock. He was wanking him off. And Malfoy liked it \u2013 more than liked it. Malfoy was moaning, his fingers digging into Harry\u2019s arm, and, bloody hell, if Harry kept this up, he might even make Malfoy come.</p>\n<p>It was incredible. Malfoy was incredible, and when he started to thrust into Harry\u2019s hand, saying, \u201cYes<em>. Yessss</em>,\u201d it felt almost as good as when Malfoy had touched Harry.</p>\n<p>There was also a kind of realisation that maybe, just maybe\u2026 the reason why he and Ginny had never gone further than kissing, was nothing to do with Ginny seeming so young at the time. Nothing to do with wanting to protect her. And a lot more to do with the fact that he had never \u2013 never, not once \u2013 felt about Ginny the way he did right now with Malfoy. As if something hot and fierce was rising up inside him, something hungry, that could only be appeased by getting Malfoy naked and doing exactly what he wanted to him, again and again. Harry felt like he would never be sated, not while Malfoy was like this, all hot breath and sharp angles and long, bare limbs, rough sounds spilling from his lips, his body twisting against Harry\u2019s, every muscle tense and ready.</p>\n<p>Harry breathed in the sweet, spicy tang of Malfoy\u2019s cologne and wondered if he would ever be able to smell it again without remembering how this felt. He almost felt like laughing, because he had thought he wasn\u2019t really that bothered about sex. He thought maybe his experiences had damaged him in some way, leaving only a faint flicker of the interest other boys seemed to feel when they talked about tits and fanny. Oh god, he\u2019d been so stupid. This \u2013 this \u2013 was what it was all about. No wonder people went on about it all the fucking time. His cock was starting to stir with interest again, sweat gathering under his arms, every inch of him surging with life. And he was never going to forgive himself for not leaving the light on to see Malfoy\u2019s face as he came, his whole body shuddering, chest heaving, a deep moan of satisfaction rumbling from his chest.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s cock jerked powerfully in Harry\u2019s hand, spunk spattering on his fist and even up onto Harry\u2019s stomach where the pyjama top was pulled askew. Before it happened, Harry might have thought this would be gross, but bloody hell, it was hot as fuck. He wished Malfoy would come some more. He wished they could do it again straight away. A raw, furious need churned inside him and images of all the things he wanted Malfoy to do to him flashed in front of Harry\u2019s eyes in the darkness.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was reaching for his wand to clean up, but Harry cast wordlessly like he normally did. He had kind of mixed feelings as the cleaning spell shimmered over his skin. Was it weird to like the thought of Malfoy\u2019s come on him?</p>\n<p>Malfoy made a surprised, breathless noise. \u201cDid you just\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blushed in the dark. He didn\u2019t usually do wandless magic in front of anyone except Ron and Hermione, in case people thought he was showing off. Being the hero. \u201cThought it would save you the bother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t say anything, but after a moment, Harry felt fingers brushing across his hip. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t bad, you know. For a first time.\u201d Malfoy sounded almost friendly.</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Did you like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah. Yeah. I liked it a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy let out a pleased laugh. \u201cOK. Well. Maybe I\u2019ll let you do it again sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. That kind of sounded\u2026 as if this was Harry\u2019s idea in the first place. As if Malfoy had been doing him a favour. But, then, actually\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to, that is,\u201d Malfoy said carelessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said quickly, before he could chicken out.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, then. Get dressed and get back in your own bed.\u201d Malfoy patted Harry, just where the curve of his arse met his thigh, and that should not have made Harry want to growl and pin Malfoy down on the bed, but it did.</p>\n<p>Harry wriggled back into his pyjama bottoms and then stepped quickly on shaky legs across the dark room. It was horribly cold, after the humid warmth under Malfoy\u2019s covers, and then pain exploded through the toes of his right foot. \u201cAh! Shit, Malfoy, why can you not leave your trunk under the bed like anybody else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy sounded smug and sleepy. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have great big feet like shovels, you wouldn\u2019t keep tripping over it all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s bed was chilly and unwelcoming, dammit. He thought of Malfoy lying curled up in the warm, while Harry nudged a toe down into sheets that felt glacial. He\u2019d probably planned it that way, the git.</p>\n<p>There was something else, as well. \u201cMalfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did used to happen in the Slytherin dorm?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a low sound of amusement. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Damn</em>. A barbed tendril of jealousy stirred in Harry\u2019s chest at the thought of all the unknown things Malfoy had done in the past. All the people he had shared his bed \u2013 and his body \u2013 with. Harry lay back and stared into the darkness. It was all very well that Harry\u2019s libido had finally woken up to the fact that he was an eighteen year old male, with desires and needs and all of that crap. But was it really necessary for it to be Malfoy who got it to sit up and take notice?</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>The library seemed airless and dusty, and Harry had read the same sentence three times already without understanding a single word. He needed a break. He\u2019d only just got there, but he still needed a break. He kept having vivid flashes of memory from the previous night, and it was the most distracting thing he\u2019d ever experienced.</p>\n<p>He passed Ron in the Long Gallery. \u201cAh, mate, just the person,\u201d Ron said. \u201cCome for a wander to Hogsmeade? I\u2019m sick of studying, and it\u2019s all Hermione and flipping Cornfoot talk about some days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m knackered. Going to go and lie down.\u201d <em>And probably wank</em>, he didn\u2019t add. God, this felt rubbish. Nothing this big had ever happened in his life without being able to share it with Ron. He felt like a dirty liar not telling him what was on his mind. But how could he? Harry could hardly just drop it into conversation, could he, that he was feeling pretty distracted because last night he had wanked off Draco Malfoy, and he was having a bit of a crisis about it.</p>\n<p>Ron screwed up his face in disappointment and Harry felt a pang of guilt twist in his ribs. He hated the feeling of neglecting his friends. But this didn\u2019t change the fact that he needed to get away and think about everything.</p>\n<p>And probably wank.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch you later, OK, Ron?\u201d</p>\n<p>The corridor leading to the Astronomy Wing was deserted, and Harry reached down to adjust himself in his trousers as he took the stairs two at a time. He remembered coming in and finding Malfoy getting changed. The time he\u2019d accidentally burst in when he was showering. Maybe today\u2014</p>\n<p>Harry flung the door wide. Malfoy was sitting on the desk, facing Harry. He had unfastened his trousers, and \u2013 fuck \u2013 his legs were apart and he was stroking his erection with pale fingers, a look of satisfaction on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. You\u2019re\u2013 uhh.\u201d Harry\u2019s tongue felt thick and clumsy in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Malfoy didn\u2019t stop, his arm moving lazily back and forth. His voice was husky. \u201cI am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s brain felt like it had liquefied and his satchel dropped onto the floor. His eyes snapped from the motion of Malfoy\u2019s hand, up to Malfoy\u2019s face, which was pinker than usual, back to Malfoy\u2019s prick, long and hard and flushed. Malfoy arched his back, one hand splayed out over the desk as he leaned back against it. His shirt had ridden up a little and Harry could see the taut skin of his stomach and the shadow of his hipbone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI keep thinking about last night,\u201d Harry blurted.</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked pleased. \u201cYeah.\u201d There was a little sheen of sweat on his top lip. \u201c<em>Uhh.</em> Good. I came up here to work and then I started thinking about\u2026 well. So I thought, <em>why not</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Why not</em>? Harry\u2019s cock throbbed painfully against the seam of his trousers. Malfoy took his bottom lip between his teeth and looked at Harry from beneath lowered eyelids. <em>Why not</em>? Harry couldn\u2019t think of a single reason. He closed the short distance between him and the desk and stepped between Malfoy\u2019s spread thighs. Malfoy\u2019s hand stilled, and Harry just stood for a moment and stared at the smooth, shiny head of Malfoy\u2019s cock, peeking out from his foreskin. Harry rested his hands on Malfoy\u2019s thighs, felt the warmth and the tight muscle through the wool trousers. It felt as if they were both holding their breath. And then Harry was leaning in, one sweaty hand slipping on the polished wood of the desk and the other reaching for Malfoy\u2019s cock, while Malfoy was tugging at Harry\u2019s belt and yanking his trousers open.</p>\n<p>God, it was almost too much. Not just the feel of Malfoy\u2019s hand, making Harry shudder, fast, shaky thrills that shot right through him. But the sight of it. Malfoy\u2019s smooth fingers working Harry\u2019s cock, and Harry\u2019s hand right next to it, wrapped around Malfoy. It didn\u2019t look real, except that it was \u2013 there was the ragged thumbnail Harry had been biting that morning, and this was actually happening, in real life. It made everything in his brain shut down except for the need to get more of this, to feel more of this, and to make Malfoy come again. Something powerful squirmed in Harry\u2019s chest to think that this time he would be able to see it.</p>\n<p>Malfoy seemed almost as worked up as Harry, the tendons on his wrist standing out as he wanked Harry, his other hand gripping Harry\u2019s shoulder tightly. Harry suddenly got a flash of what it would look like if someone were to walk in at that moment, the two of them frantically clutching at one another and urging each other on with disjointed grunts and gasps.</p>\n<p><em>This is mad</em>, thought Harry, <em>The war\u2019s sent us both mad</em>. But it seemed a far, far saner way to behave than so many of the other things he\u2019d been forced to do in his life.</p>\n<p>A drop of sweat fell from Harry\u2019s brow as his arm worked furiously, chasing Malfoy\u2019s pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nnngh</em>,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cGonna come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, letting his forehead press against Malfoy\u2019s as they both watched the movement of their hands. \u201cYeah,\u201d he breathed, hot ripples building in his thighs, his balls drawing up tight and ready to release.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s fingers dug painfully into Harry\u2019s shoulder and then he was coming, his stomach clenching, cock twitching. Harry moaned, long and loud, and if he hadn\u2019t have been about to come anyway, this still would have tipped him over the edge: the sight of Malfoy coming and coming, coating his own stomach and dripping down Harry\u2019s fist.</p>\n<p>Harry made a sound more like an animal than a person, his mouth falling open as his orgasm ripped its way down his spine and out through his balls. Malfoy\u2019s hand had gone limp, but now he redoubled his efforts and worked Harry\u2019s cock until Harry was empty, his body shaking and gasping. Harry\u2019s spunk was mixed with Malfoy\u2019s, smeared across his skin. Harry stared, memorising how it looked, knowing there was no possibility he was ever going to be able to think about this in the future without getting hard.</p>\n<p>Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment and sagged back against the desk. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, his eyes wandering over Malfoy\u2019s face, softer in repose than he remembered ever seeing it, his lips pink and full.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s chest heaved and then he opened his eyes. \u201cAre you going to do your sexy wandless thing now?\u201d He arched one eyebrow upwards.</p>\n<p>Harry felt his cheeks flame. \u201cUh. OK.\u201d He gathered his magic into his fingertips and then focused on the incantation.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s lips curved into a slow smile as Harry\u2019s spell washed over him. There was a still a smear of come near his hipbone, but Harry didn\u2019t say anything. Something in him liked the thought of Malfoy going about his day with a little reminder of Harry on his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s... really quite cool,\u201d Malfoy said, buttoning his trousers. \u201cWhat else can you do that way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, not much,\u201d Harry said, thinking of at least a dozen wandless spells he could do easily, and a few more that he could manage with effort. He fastened his own trousers, but it took a couple of goes because his hands were shaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you teach me how?\u201d Malfoy asked, tucking in his shirt. He hardly looked rumpled at all, unless you counted the fall of hair that had flopped down over his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK.\u201d Harry realised he sounded uncertain, so he said it again, more confidently. \u201cOK.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Malfoy looked at Harry slyly. \u201cIt can be your way of paying me back. You know, for showing you stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something uncomfortable twisted in Harry\u2019s stomach. Did Malfoy not want to do this with him anyway, then? He seemed to enjoy it enough while it was happening. But then why would he talk about Harry paying him back? Harry's brows drew down and his chin jutted moodily.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need to look like that,\u201d Malfoy said, frowning. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to share your little secrets, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s OK. I will. I mean, I want to.\u201d OK, so he might be an idiot. But he wasn\u2019t such an idiot that he was going to turn down the offer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Malfoy smiled again, and Harry wished his stomach would <em>stop</em> flopping around like this, because it was making him feel weird. He had the strangest urge to push that piece of hair back from Malfoy\u2019s face, but he grabbed his satchel instead and stuffed his hands deep into his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing back to the library for a bit,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to get stuck in here.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s mouth twitched at the corners. \u201cActual schoolwork this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we can have a go later.\u201d Harry felt his cheeks flame at how that sounded. \u201cI mean, the wandless thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Malfoy was reaching for his books, but he flashed another smile at Harry, and, hell, Harry needed to get out of here before he did something stupid. \u201cWe can have a go.\u201d He let his voice drop in pitch. \u201cLater.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a good job Harry had just come, or he would have been concealing yet another hard-on all the way back to the library.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Dusk was falling outside, but it was not yet dark enough to switch on a light. Malfoy was sitting on Harry\u2019s bed looking ever so slightly anxious. \u201cGive me your wand,\u201d Harry told Malfoy.</p>\n<p>Malfoy frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt helps if you don\u2019t have it anywhere near you to start with,\u201d Harry explained.</p>\n<p>Malfoy drew the hawthorn wand from his pocket and Harry took it and walked to the desk. The wood felt receptive to his touch, and he let it slip into his palm for a moment, remembering the many times he had channelled his magic through its unicorn hair core. Sometimes, that narrow length of wood had seemed like the only thing he had to rely on. He liked seeing it there in his hand again. A wand was such an intimate thing; he had got used to the feel of it, and then to return it to Malfoy after his trial and give up that connection Harry had felt with it\u2026 that had been harder than he expected.</p>\n<p>He realised Malfoy was sitting there waiting, and placed the wand on the desk. \u201cOK. So, what\u2019s the spell you find easiest to cast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy shrugged his skinny shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably one that you do pretty often. Kind of without thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe\u2026 <em>Lumos</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Harry let his hand relax, and summoned his magic into it, feeling it tingling at his palm. <em>Lumos</em>, he thought, and let the energy flow into his fingers. A warm glow appeared at the tips and Malfoy\u2019s eyes widened.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do it, too,\u201d Harry told him. \u201cYou just need to practise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy nodded. \u201cOK. So what do I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry considered it. \u201cYou probably won\u2019t get the hang of it in one go, so maybe we should break it down. You know how you use your wand to sort of guide your magic? It\u2019s just the same, but you\u2019re guiding it yourself.\u201d Harry thought <em>Lumos</em> again, and once more the glowing light appeared at his fingertips. \u201cOK, that feeling you get just before you cast? Like your hand\u2019s getting warm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked dubious, and Harry went to sit next to him on the bed, took hold of Malfoy\u2019s narrow wrist so that his palm was facing upwards. \u201cHere,\u201d Harry said, tracing his finger around the shallow bowl of Malfoy\u2019s palm. \u201cOr you might feel it running down your arm. Summon your magic into your hand, and then once you\u2019ve got the hang of that, we\u2019ll go on to the next bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy wet his lips. \u201cBut... how do I summon my magic when my wand\u2019s over there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErm,\u201d said Harry. \u201cJust imagine that feeling, starting from here.\u201d He let his fingers move up Malfoy\u2019s wrist, over the tendons. The skin there was amazingly smooth, and Harry did it again, just so he could feel it. \u201cThe warmth, or tingling, or\u2013 I dunno. Sometimes it\u2019s like bubbles, inside you, yeah? Just imagine it in your mind, and try to get your magic flowing in that direction. You must have done it thousands of times. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re usually holding a wand when you do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two lines appeared between Malfoy\u2019s eyebrows, and Harry shook his head. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t try so hard. Think how it normally happens.\u201d His fingers brushed along Malfoy\u2019s inner arm again \u2013 his skin was so pale there it was almost white, the veins a map of milky-blue pathways, and Malfoy made a small sound as Harry\u2019s fingers travelled down to his wrist. \"Like your blood pumping around your body,\u201d Harry told him. \u201cYou can\u2019t force it. It flows by itself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy stared at his arm and made a frustrated sound, pulling it away from Harry. \u201cI know what I want it to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI just can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just practice,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYears ago, nobody used wands. And in parts of Africa, they still don\u2019t bother, half the time \u2013 it\u2019s easier, more satisfying really, just to use your own hand. But we\u2019ve forgotten how. Use the incantation, that might help. You can say it out loud.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy closed his eyes. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d he said, and then his eyes sprang open. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou felt it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. <em>Lumos</em>,\u201d he said again. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>. Bugger. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOK. Just remember. What did it feel like? Picture that, and say it. Close your eyes again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy did, and Harry watched him sitting there, serious and solemn, his lips parted. He looked like a prince in a story book, with his fine-boned face and his silver-sleek hair. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Malfoy said, and then made a low sound, a little grunt of pleasure. \u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d he said, eyes still closed, and Harry had to shift on the bed because the look on Malfoy\u2019s face was making him think of something quite different.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on. You can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. <em>Lumos</em>. Fuck, yes.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s eyes opened again. \u201cFeel it.\u201d He grabbed Harry\u2019s hand with his own. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>. I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry could feel flickers of magic skittering all around them. He closed his own eyes and ran his fingers over the smoothness of Malfoy\u2019s palm. \u201cUhh. <em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Malfoy said, and Harry felt a burst of energy, brief and electric, against his fingertips.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. Yes. That\u2019s it.\u201d He felt excitement fizzing inside him at Malfoy\u2019s achievement.</p>\n<p>Their hands slid together, Malfoy\u2019s thumb rubbing across the callouses at the base of Harry\u2019s fingers. Fuck, that was distracting. Like hot sparks rushing over every nerve ending.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s more tiring than I expected,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know. It gets easier. Now \u2013 <em>mmm</em> \u2013 you have to let it flow out to your fingers,\u201d Harry told him. But Malfoy was no longer looking at their hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s enough for a first attempt?\u201d His gaze ran over Harry\u2019s face, his lips still parted.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah?\u201c Harry let Malfoy\u2019s hand drop, realising he was breathing quite hard considering they were both just sitting on a bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Malfoy was staring at Harry\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was good, for a first time,\u201d Harry said, then had to swallow hard when he realised what he\u2019d said, what it sounded like...</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m a natural.\u201d Malfoy was smiling, and it made Harry\u2019s stomach flip. \u201cBut there are other things I\u2019d rather be doing right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dusk was drawing in every minute and the shadows cast intriguing patterns over the angles of Malfoy\u2019s face, softening them. Malfoy\u2019s hand slid over Harry\u2019s knee and slowly up to his thigh. \u201cTime for me to give you another lesson,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was because what had happened earlier had taken away the urgency, but this felt so different. Malfoy untucked Harry\u2019s shirt and began to unbutton it, watching his face the whole time while Harry sat quivering with need and uncertainty. Everything felt in slow motion and he had no idea where this was going. It felt as if he might easily ruin the moment if he spoke or did the wrong thing, so he did nothing. When the shirt was half off Harry\u2019s shoulders, Malfoy pushed Harry down on the bed and lay down next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake my cock out,\u201d Malfoy whispered. Well, Harry could definitely do <em>that</em>. Malfoy was hard again, and something about this set heat flaring inside Harry \u2013 the thought that Malfoy had got hard just from starting to undress him. Malfoy\u2019s cock felt so bloody good in his hand, but Harry wasn\u2019t sure he would ever get used to the thrill of seeing it like that, with his own fist wrapped around it. He began to wank Malfoy off like he had done before, but Malfoy wrapped his hand around Harry\u2019s wrist, pinning it against the bed while he unbuckled Harry\u2019s belt with his other hand. Harry was aching by the time Malfoy had got his trousers open and began palming Harry\u2019s erection through his pants.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uhhh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy let his hand slide down to Harry\u2019s balls, caressing them through the thin cotton and then back up to his prick, making Harry\u2019s mouth fall open in a moan.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that good?\u201d Malfoy asked, massaging with a firm hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2013 uh\u2013 yeah,\u201d Harry gasped, closing his eyes for a moment and letting the hot waves of it ripple over him. \u201cGod, yeah, really \u2013 uh \u2013 really, yeah, so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy smiled, slow and appreciative. Harry was leaking pre-come and Malfoy rubbed at the damp fabric, swiping his thumb over the head. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Malfoy asked, his eyes drinking in all of Harry's reactions, every twitch, every moan.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d Harry wanted everything. Anything. \u201cI\u2013 I dunno.\u201d It was like asking a starving man to order in French from a fancy restaurant menu.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s hand squeezed around his cock and Harry jerked on the bed. \u201c<em>Uhh</em>. That. I want that,\u201d Harry told him.</p>\n<p>Malfoy laughed softly and eased Harry\u2019s pants down so that they were around his thighs, then shifted on the bed until he was lying propped up on one arm, facing Harry. His fingers circled the base of Harry\u2019s cock, a snug, sure fit.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2013 <em>uh</em>. Can I touch you?\u201d Harry reached for Malfoy again, but Malfoy brushed his hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Not this time.\u201d Malfoy started to move his hand, sending a rush of sensation through Harry. Then Malfoy moved so that his own erection slid against Harry\u2019s body, a sweet drag of friction along the dip between Harry\u2019s hipbone and his stomach. He moved like that, slow and deliberate, his eyes smoky in the dim light, his fist still firm around Harry\u2019s cock, and Harry thought he might break apart with the pure dazzling pleasure of it.</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t rush, and Harry savoured every thrust of his hips, the slickness of pre-come smearing over Harry\u2019s stomach, the clasp of Malfoy\u2019s fist around him. Harry began to move, too, tentative at first and then finding a rhythm, pushing Malfoy\u2019s shirt up out of the way so that he could feel more of him, skin against skin against skin. His whole body blazed with it. Malfoy kept moving like that, moving and stroking, his face serious, and it all felt so incredible that Harry didn\u2019t know what to do. Malfoy arched his hips so that the length of his shaft dragged over the head of Harry\u2019s cock, and Harry cried out, sudden and shaky, at the unexpected bliss of it.</p>\n<p>He looked up at Malfoy, wondering whether it felt anywhere near that good for him, and finding Malfoy\u2019s eyes dark and intent, Harry bit his lip so he wouldn\u2019t cry out again. But Malfoy began thrusting harder and faster against Harry, propped up above him on both arms with his muscles straining, making a low, rough sound deep in his throat which was one of the hottest things Harry had ever heard.</p>\n<p>Malfoy thrust again, then buried his face in Harry\u2019s neck and came hard, shooting all over Harry\u2019s stomach, his body a juddering weight pinning him to the bed. Harry found himself grinding up against Malfoy, clutching at his arse and groaning, his own prick jerking to a hot, slippery climax in the perfect press of their bodies.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Draco</em>,\u201d Harry panted, then said it again because of how good it felt in his mouth. \u201c<em>Draco</em>,\u201d just like that, in two breaths, like a plea and then a sigh, and Malfoy would probably think he was a complete idiot, but at the time, Harry didn\u2019t even care.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was dusk again. Malfoy said it was better for his concentration at that time of day and Harry could see why, with the darkness settling all around them like a cloak. It was easier to imagine the idea of <em>Lumos</em>, springing from Malfoy\u2019s fingers like a beacon, and they would instantly be able to see any glimmer of light that Malfoy produced.</p>\n<p>Harry sat holding Malfoy\u2019s hand, letting his thumb trace slowly over the creases of Malfoy\u2019s palm and mapping the delicate bones of his wrist. That was easier in the half-darkness, too, with Malfoy\u2019s eyes much softer than the piercing grey of daytime. It sometimes felt as though anything at all could happen, here in their room. As if Harry could say or do anything, anything he wanted, and it would be OK, because\u2014</p>\n<p>There was a sharp rap at the door and Harry, startled, dropped Malfoy\u2019s hand as if it had burned him. Malfoy frowned and they both sat there, waiting for the person to go away, but another knock came and a voice drawled, \u201cDraco? I know you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy cleared his throat. \u201cYes? What is it, Theo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy stood up and smoothed a hand over his hair, then switched the light on. Harry\u2019s shirt had come untucked at some point and he hurriedly stuffed it back in as Malfoy opened the door a few scant inches.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat Arithmancy book you wanted. I\u2019ve finished with it.\u201d Nott sounded, as usual, as if he found everything beneath him.</p>\n<p>Malfoy took the large volume, nodded his thanks, and tried to shut the door again, but Nott had his foot in the way. \u201cWhat are you up to, Draco? Have you got someone in there?\u201d He put his head round the door. \u201cOh. Hello, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave him a curt nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you having a pleasant afternoon?\u201d Nott raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re busy with something,\u201d Malfoy said dismissively.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d call by. To give you the book, and because we never seem to see you any more. But I see now that it\u2019s because you\u2019re far too <em>busy</em> up here, with Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt himself colouring at the way Nott said <em>busy</em>. He had never imagined the word could sound so filthy.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the book,\u201d Malfoy said, trying again to shut the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, like that, is it? Well, you know where to find me. You know, if you get bored of what\u2019s on offer elsewhere. Or maybe I\u2019ll come and find <em>you</em> some time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stiffened at Nott\u2019s suggestive tones. Did that mean what he thought it did? Something fierce stirred in his chest at the thought of Malfoy taking Nott up on his offer.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cYou\u2019d best move your foot, Theo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should probably watch out, or people will talk.\u201d Nott lowered his voice, but Harry heard, \u201cWhat will they think about their precious hero spending all this time with a De\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a brief scuffle, and then the door was closed quite firmly, with Nott on the other side of it.</p>\n<p>After a silence, Harry cleared his throat. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t he the charmer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were nearly there with <em>Lumos</em>, you know.\u201d Harry gestured to where Malfoy had been sitting. \u201cWhen he turned up.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Malfoy didn\u2019t come back to sit with Harry. Instead he walked to the desk to collect his wand, then back to his own bed where he stood and stared at the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Malfoy said, flat and cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we try again?\u201d Harry could still feel the way Malfoy\u2019s hand had lain in his. The press of Malfoy\u2019s leg, warm and firm, against his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d Malfoy fiddled with his wand, turning it over in his hands.</p>\n<p>Something Nott had said had really rattled Malfoy. <em>People will talk</em> \u2013 was that it? Maybe he thought\u2013 \u201cPeople will just think he\u2019s making shit up, you know. I\u2019m not going to tell anyone,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Malfoy looked up at him, his eyes palest silver, his face haughty. \u201cTell them\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know. About <em>Lumos</em>. About you practising. Or...\u201d</p>\n<p>Who was Harry kidding? It wasn\u2019t <em>Lumos</em> that Malfoy was bothered about, was it? It was the fact that he and Harry had been doing the other stuff together, and Malfoy clearly didn\u2019t want his friends to know. Harry wasn\u2019t prepared for the clammy slither of disappointment that he felt. \u201cI won\u2019t tell them about <em>any</em> of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed in his throat, and he lifted his chin. \u201cNo. I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually do wandless magic myself when there are people around. They can be a bit... funny about it.\u201d Harry laughed, but it sounded forced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never thought for a moment that you would tell anyone, Potter.\u201d Malfoy gave a tight little smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything that happens in this room is the deepest secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. Malfoy must really hate the idea of Nott talking about them. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try again?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou were getting close. I could feel it.\u201d He wanted to go to Malfoy, to reach for his hand. To smooth his hands over Malfoy\u2019s shoulders and see if he could stop him standing in that stiff, hurt-looking way\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough,\u201d Malfoy said, reaching for his satchel. \u201cI\u2019m going to the library.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll come too.\u201d Harry stood up.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d The corner of his mouth twisted into an ugly sneer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to talk, do we?\u201d He threw the bag over his shoulder and made for the door. As the door swung shut, chilly air from the corridor rushed in and hit Harry in the face like a slap.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>That night, Malfoy turned out the light after using the bathroom, and slipped wordlessly between the sheets.</p>\n<p>Harry lay staring into the darkness before asking in a breathless whisper, \u201cCan I come over there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t answer for a moment. Then he asked haughtily, \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what for,\u201d Harry said, his prick leaping hard and eager at the thought of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, do I?\u201d Malfoy didn\u2019t sound impressed, but that wasn\u2019t enough to discourage Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you do.\u201d Harry rolled on his side towards him, feeling bold. \u201cA good hard what for. Or a long, slow one, if you prefer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll give <em>you</em> what for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry let his own hand trail across his stomach, adjusting his pyjamas where the fabric tented. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was another silence, then: \u201cGo on then. If you must.\u201d It sounded grudging, but when Harry slid in next to him, he found Malfoy was already hard, too.</p>\n<p>Harry missed being able to see Malfoy\u2019s face, his expression as Harry pulled Malfoy\u2019s pyjamas down and yanked his own right off. His desire felt urgent, fierce, as if he couldn\u2019t wait another minute to get his hands on Malfoy, and Malfoy grunted approval as Harry slid his palm over the length of his cock, so smooth and solid and satisfying. He shifted his hips towards Malfoy, craving friction, closeness, heat \u2013 an urgent need seething in him as his cock dragged over the firm flesh of Malfoy\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>Malfoy rolled onto his side so they were facing one another and shifted against Harry until their cocks brushed together. Harry let out a harsh sound at the feel of it, and then another as Malfoy wrapped his hand as far as he could around the two of them, wanking their two foreskins against one another and nudging the head of his cock with delicious intent against Harry\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d Harry gasped.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d Malfoy asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. <em>Yes</em>,\u201d Harry told him, the words nowhere near enough, but they were all he could manage at that moment. Malfoy moved so that his legs tangled with Harry\u2019s, their bodies flush together, their cocks sliding snugly together in Malfoy\u2019s fist. Malfoy made a sort of whining sound, and Harry\u2019s arms flew up to Malfoy\u2019s waist and lay there, his thumbs resting in the smooth dip just above the hip bone. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was OK to touch Malfoy like this, but <em>ohhh</em>, Malfoy\u2019s hand, Malfoy\u2019s cock, even Malfoy\u2019s balls dragging against his own, made it impossible to think straight. Spikes of pleasure surged through him, wave after wave, and he buried his face in the smooth, yielding skin where Malfoy\u2019s throat met his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Holy hell. Harry pulled Malfoy to him, his hands bolder than ever. He had never felt anything like it in his life, the glorious tightness of Malfoy\u2019s fist, the taut curves of Malfoy\u2019s arse shifting against his hands, the warm, fresh smell of Malfoy\u2019s skin against his nose, and the amazing feel of Malfoy\u2019s cock next to his, silky-sleek and perfect. Harry\u2019s lips opened in a long moan, not caring what he sounded like or who might hear.</p>\n<p>He wanted to do this forever. Just this, nothing but hands and mouths and sweat on skin, blood pumping and every nerve in his body singing <em>yes, yes, yes</em>. Malfoy threw his head back as Harry\u2019s tongue slid over his skin, <em>fuck, yes</em>, and they were both panting so hard. Malfoy\u2019s hand moved faster, urgent, Malfoy\u2019s breath hot against Harry\u2019s cheek, and for one crazy moment Harry thought of how it would be to cover Malfoy\u2019s lips with his own. But then Malfoy thrust against him, fierce and incredible, and everything got slippery with Malfoy\u2019s come, and then Harry was groaning, long and hard and he couldn\u2019t believe it, he couldn\u2019t believe how good it felt.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Afterwards it was still pitch black and when Harry cleaned them up, he felt all soft and relaxed, so his magic seemed to come out that way too, lingering over Malfoy\u2019s skin like a caress. Malfoy squirmed a bit, as if he liked the feel of it, and when it was finished, he didn\u2019t suggest Harry should go back to his own bed.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was breathing slow and even, and one of Harry\u2019s hands was still resting against Malfoy\u2019s hair; it was just where it had ended up, after they both came, and he didn\u2019t see why he should move it now. It tickled against his palm, and Harry thought about how it would feel if he spread his fingers a little and sifted through the cool strands of it. He suspected Malfoy\u2019s hair would smell good, too, if Harry leaned in. The rest of him did. But maybe if he did any of those things, it would remind Malfoy that Harry was still there, and he might remember to say\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI really like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy hadn\u2019t said that. Harry had, and he hadn\u2019t meant to, but it had slipped out anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Malfoy sounded half asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really like this. You know. What we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Malfoy was laughing. \u201cWell, of course. <em>Everybody</em> really likes this, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d <em>Oh, fuck it. Why the hell not?</em> \u201cI mean <em>with you</em>. I really like doing this with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy went quiet for a few moments. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know why, but just telling Malfoy this made something thrilling bubble up into his chest. It felt risky and wonderful.</p>\n<p>Apparently Malfoy\u2019s hand had just happened to end up by the nape of Harry\u2019s neck, because Harry felt Malfoy\u2019s fingers tease lightly over the tufts of hair there and across the tender skin below. It pulled a soft sound from Harry\u2019s throat, and he let his fingers slip into Malfoy\u2019s hair, too, to rest against the warmth of his scalp. Malfoy\u2019s breath caught in a weird way and Harry could feel the weight of all the other things he wanted to say, feel them tingling on his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco,\u201d he said, and it sounded a bit terrifying. And then, he had no idea why \u2013 apparently his brain thought it was a better option than some of the other stuff rattling around in his head \u2013 but the next words that came out were, \u201cHow\u2019s your Mum?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s hand froze in his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2014 I\u2019ve been meaning to ask. How she is.\u201d This was true. Harry had been meaning to write to Narcissa since the battle, but he wasn\u2019t sure how you began such a letter, and so he had put it off until it seemed too late to try at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite well.\u201d Malfoy sounded every inch the Pureblood. \u201cWhy on earth do you want to know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe helped me at the end. With Voldemort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell. Did she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. She was trying to get to you, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry could hear Malfoy swallowing in the darkness. \u201cMerlin, Potter, you\u2019ll drag up any old crap to avoid going back to a cold bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry thought of all of the other idiotic words inside him that were still trying to spill out, and pushed them down again. He was screwing this up badly, and now Malfoy had gone all closed off and prickly. Harry tried to sound offhand. \u201cYeah, well. I know your fucking trunk is lying in wait for me. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy grunted. \u201cThe trunk\u2019s under the bed. Now bugger off. I want to sleep.\u201d His fingers skated over the back of Harry\u2019s neck one more time and then withdrew.</p>\n<p>The trunk was slap in the middle of the floor again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou lying arsehole!\u201d Harry yelped. \u201cWhy is it always afterwards that I walk into it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause apparently your brain turns to mush once you\u2019ve had an orgasm.\u201d Malfoy sounded smug, warm, and distinctly uninjured. Harry considered going back over there and kicking him, only he would probably stub his toe a second time on the way back.</p>\n<p>They were both silent for a while, the owls hooting, low and gentle. Then Malfoy said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell my mother you were asking after her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, do that. Send her my\u2026\u201d Harry nearly said <em>love</em>, but stopped himself in time. \u201cMy good wishes, or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry could hear Malfoy shifting around to get comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, goodnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry expected to dream of Voldemort, of Narcissa\u2019s ashen face as she bent over him on the ground. But instead he slept soundly until light was creeping in through the crack in the curtains.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry took the stairs two at a time. They had an hour to practise <em>Lumos</em> before dinner, and something made him feel really good about Malfoy\u2019s chances today. But from outside the room, he heard voices, and when he pushed the door open, Goyle was sitting at the desk with his back to Harry. Malfoy leant against the window ledge, his hands in his pockets. Goyle didn\u2019t seem to be in distress \u2013 he hadn\u2019t heard Harry come in and was laughing, presumably at something Malfoy had just said. But Harry still felt like he was intruding, and he caught Malfoy\u2019s eye.</p>\n<p><em>Shall I go?</em> he mouthed.</p>\n<p>Malfoy wrinkled his nose apologetically and gave a small nod. Goyle looked around and stopped laughing when he saw Harry there.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ve, er, left something downstairs. See you later.\u201d He backed out, wondering how long Greg would stay, and fighting against a ridiculous feeling of disappointment.</p>\n<p>Maybe he would go and find Ron. There was time for a nice fast fly before dinner, or maybe even a game of Quidditch if they could round up some others who were at a loose end. Harry hurried down the stairs again, good spirits rising up inside him once more.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>He passed Malfoy on the way to dinner. \u201cSorry about earlier,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Harry said, truthfully. It had been exhilarating up on the broom, and great to spend time with Ron, passing the Quaffle back and forth while trying to out-do each other with fancy manoeuvres. They\u2019d agreed to carry on the game after dinner if it stayed dry, and Harry was looking forward to it. \u201cHow\u2019s Goyle doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy shrugged. \u201cHe could be a lot worse, you know? The guy he shares with apparently comes from a long line of Hufflepuffs, because his grandmother has started owling a ton of homemade cakes and stuff to Greg every week.\u201d He snorted. \u201cShe feels sorry for him or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThat\u2019s so bloody unfair. How come I didn\u2019t get to share with a Hufflepuff?</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d Malfoy raised an amused eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should stage a protest. <em>Hufflepuffs for all</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>They grinned at one another, and then Malfoy stopped suddenly, his face going oddly still, and Harry realised Hermione was standing at his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Harry. Malfoy,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cGranger,\u201d Malfoy nodded politely enough, but he looked uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you on your way to eat?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think we\u2019re a bit late. Mandy and Daphne and I lost track of time; Professor Slughorn\u2019s letting us use the Potions room to do some work when he\u2019s not teaching in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy nodded again, rather stiffly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going in for dinner now. Good evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d Harry had to stop himself from following Malfoy with his eyes as he walked away.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he always so stuffy and Pureblooded like that?\u201d Hermione whispered, taking Harry\u2019s arm as they walked to the Gryffindor table.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr. Not really.\u201d Harry had a flash of Malfoy with his head thrown back, on the edge of orgasm.</p>\n<p>Hermione frowned. \u201cMaybe just when there are people like <em>me</em> around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it,\u201d said Harry. But what did he know? If he and Malfoy never talked about anything important, how could he know how Malfoy felt about any of it?</p>\n<p>After dinner, Harry and Ron flew until they were aching with cold and Harry\u2019s arse felt like it had gone to sleep, possibly permanently. It was, as Ron said, bloody brilliant.</p>\n<p>Harry showered before bed and then \u2013 Harry really hoped he wasn\u2019t reading this wrong \u2013 he put on a clean, black pair of boxers and left it at that. Well, it seemed bloody stupid to put his pyjamas on just so that Malfoy could take them off again. He paused before coming out of the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror.</p>\n<p>He looked\u2026 all right. He hoped so, anyway. Malfoy was bloody gorgeous, that was the thing. An ordinary bloke like Harry was always going to look a bit of a troll next to him. But Harry\u2019s body wasn\u2019t the worst. He wasn\u2019t totally scrawny like he used to be \u2013 Molly had fed him up over the summer and he\u2019d flown a lot with Ron, and built up a bit of muscle in the right kind of places.</p>\n<p>He glanced at his hair and winced, but there was nothing he could do about that. He thought about shaving, peering at the sharp stubble on his jaw, but that would mean he would be quite a long time in the bathroom, almost as if he was getting <em>ready</em> for Malfoy, and god knows this wasn\u2019t some kind of <em>date</em>... This was getting silly. Harry squared his shoulders and opened the bathroom door.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was at the desk making some notes, but when he saw Harry, he stopped writing and just sat there <em>looking</em>, the quill poised in mid-air. His eyes ran over Harry\u2019s body, from his chest, across his stomach, then lingering over Harry\u2019s thighs and the cotton-covered bulge between them, and Harry was regretting the no-pyjama thing already. He was an idiot \u2013 he wasn\u2019t nearly fit enough to be sauntering around in his pants like this, and the way Malfoy was looking at him, he felt bloody <em>naked</em>.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what to do: Get into bed? Sit and read? Nothing seemed right, not with Malfoy staring at him like that, his eyes burning into Harry. Harry was just about to go back into the bathroom and get dressed when Malfoy put down the quill and said, \"Time for bed, Potter. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>After they had both come, Malfoy didn\u2019t mention Harry leaving at all, but lay with his hand lightly on Harry\u2019s hair. He was breathing slowly as if, given enough time, he might fall asleep that way, and Harry felt such a mixture of things: grateful, and a bit raw, and kind of dazed. He\u2019d never dreamed of the simple peace of another person\u2019s body next to his. After a while, he started thinking of all the nights he\u2019d spent lying awake on his own, the horrors and the guilt and the loneliness and the fucking <em>relentlessness</em> of it all, of being a survivor.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you dream about the people who died?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2014 I know sometimes you can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s been the same for me. And often it\u2019s because I know I\u2019m going to dream about them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a ray of sunshine you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut since we... since this started, I haven\u2019t had those dreams. Not so much, anyway. So I just wondered if it was the same for you. You were there when he killed Professor Burbage, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy turned his head away. \u201cMerlin, Potter, can we not\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I saw him forcing you to torture Rowle \u2013 I used to see stuff through his eyes, did you know that? I saw how you hated it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s voice was sharper than usual. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough of this conversation now\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But Harry pressed on. \u201cI sometimes think you and me saw the worst of it, you know? We saw, more than anyone else, what he did. Maybe we\u2019re the only ones here who get what it was like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy swallowed and it sounded painful. Then, \u201cI still hate him so fucking much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d There was nothing else to say. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>Harry was surprised. \u201cYou want to\u2014 again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy nodded. When Harry reached for him, his cock was soft, but it soon stirred under Harry\u2019s hand and that was something new and astonishing, feeling it swell and harden at his touch.</p>\n<p>Malfoy sighed and rested his forehead on Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYes\u2026 s\u2019good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry changed his grip, listening to Malfoy\u2019s breathing, trying to find the rhythm, the angle that would make him gasp and moan. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you feel shitty. I\u2019m just not sure if anyone else understands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy did moan, then, a soft cry muffled by Harry\u2019s chest, and he pushed into Harry\u2019s hand. \u201c<em>Yes</em>. Like that.\u201d He swallowed again. \u201cThat whole time he was living at the Manor. I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t do this at all.\u201d Harry\u2019s rhythm faltered and Malfoy pressed his hand over Harry\u2019s, urging him on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get it up. No matter what I tried. I sometimes felt as if I was dead already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t know what to say, so he just kept stroking. Malfoy\u2019s body felt so alive, taut and trembling, and his cock pulsing right there in Harry\u2019s hand. Malfoy\u2019s breath was hot against Harry\u2019s skin as he hissed the words out. \u201cI felt like I deserved to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry\u2019s tempo stuttered again and he spoke fiercely. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>, keep touching me.\u201d He made a sound like a small sob. \u201cPlease. Feels so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry told him. He didn\u2019t talk any more, just held Malfoy and stroked him, firm and steady, until he came with a thankful cry, all over Harry\u2019s fist.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was dusk. Which was rapidly becoming one of Harry\u2019s favourite parts of the day.</p>\n<p>Harry took Malfoy\u2019s wand and put it on the desk, as usual, but this time, without knowing quite why, Harry got his own wand out and laid it down next to Malfoy\u2019s. He stood there for a minute and stared at them, lying side by side. He liked the way they looked, together, the paler holly bringing out the warmth of the hawthorn, and the rougher, twisting lines of Harry\u2019s wand a nice contrast to the elegant taper of Malfoy\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Also, there was something else he liked\u2026 something about the fact he and Malfoy were both at a disadvantage, with their wands out of reach like this. That they\u2019d both chosen to make themselves slightly vulnerable to one another. It felt... satisfying, in a way he couldn\u2019t describe.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was waiting on the bed, one eyebrow raised. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re really close, you know. I even thought I saw a flicker last time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy moved up to make room for Harry. \u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d He closed his eyes, and Harry felt guilty at the way he let himself look at Malfoy when Malfoy couldn\u2019t see. At his pale lashes. His sharp cheekbones. The sensual curve of his mouth, and the sweep of his jaw, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Malfoy said, and Harry flicked his gaze to Malfoy\u2019s fingers. Nothing visible, but he could sense Malfoy\u2019s magic flickering, pulsing back and forth along his arm. He reached for Malfoy\u2019s wrist and held it lightly, cradling it in his fingers while his thumb sought the delicate rhythm of Malfoy\u2019s pulse.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s eyes fluttered open. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNearly. You can do it,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Malfoy nodded, but chewed his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust relax,\u201d Harry said. \u201cKeep it instinctive, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Malfoy said, and Harry could feel the energy gathering in his palm, but he could also feel Malfoy\u2019s arm tensing with the effort of trying to channel it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink of something you do that\u2019s natural and easy. Like\u2026 catching the Snitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy frowned. Harry could feel Malfoy's magic swirling, agitated and directionless, and Harry's brows drew down with the effort of trying to explain. \u201cThere\u2019s that moment where you just reach out and then it\u2019s there in your hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo long since I caught any bloody Snitch,\u201d Malfoy griped. \u201cAll the studying this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry tried to think. Malfoy\u2019s pulse beat against his thumb, bold and dauntless, and he remembered feeling the same pulse throb at Malfoy\u2019s throat the night before. Covering it with his mouth, crying out against Malfoy\u2019s skin, the way his body had reacted, intense and unstoppable.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike coming,\u201d Harry said, and didn\u2019t look away when Malfoy\u2019s silvery eyes fixed on his. \u201cLike when we make each other come, yeah?\u201d Saying it out loud made him want to blush, but he knew he was right. Wandless magic was like sex. Raw and instinctive, and pleasurable in the same deep, powerful way.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice was rough, and Harry wanted to remind him, right this minute, how it felt when they stopped thinking and did whatever felt good. Harry wanted to show him exactly how perfect that was.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think about it, you can\u2019t force it. It just happens to you. You have to let go, let it sort of flood through you, and then\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy was watching Harry\u2019s mouth, his eyes dark and hungry, and Harry\u2019s throat was too dry to carry on. Malfoy\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed once in his narrow throat, and then he lifted his chin. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Harry felt it like a torrent of energy; a great rush of magic, powerful and beautiful. It made the hairs on his arms stand up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he urged. \u201cLike that, just like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Malfoy said again, and this time a shimmer of gold outlined his fingertips for a fleeting moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d whispered Harry.</p>\n<p>Malfoy was gazing at his own hand, transfixed. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d he said. It felt smoother somehow this time, still surging along Malfoy\u2019s arm, but\u2026 it felt more assured. And there it was, not a glimmer, but a <em>glow</em>, strong and steady and undeniable.</p>\n<p>Harry reached for Malfoy\u2019s fingers, fascinated by the soft rich warmth, but the light flickered uncertainly, and then went out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did it,\u201d Harry said. \u201cFuck. Do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lumos</em>.\u201d Heat flowed through Malfoy\u2019s arm, and his fingers bloomed with light, and Harry traced the brilliance of them with his own, his breath catching in his chest. God, he hadn\u2019t expected to feel like this. Malfoy was doing it \u2013 wandless magic, elemental and pure and \u2013 hell, it was impressive. He felt shivery, just watching. It made him feel sort of <em>reverent</em>. And ridiculously turned on.</p>\n<p>Malfoy glanced at him, eyes widening as he took in Harry\u2019s expression. The light dimmed for a moment, but, \u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Malfoy said again, and this time it burned brighter than ever. Malfoy lifted his hand, still glowing, and touched the tip of his finger to Harry\u2019s wrist, where his sleeve was rolled up. Harry could feel it, the subtle, pulsing heat of it, thrilling over his skin. Malfoy drew in a breath and traced along Harry\u2019s arm, illuminating the freckles and the hairs, and then slipping over the paler skin of Harry\u2019s inner arm, right to the crook of his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you learn to do this?\u201d Malfoy said, his voice husky.</p>\n<p>Harry stared at Malfoy\u2019s fingers, at the golden splash of light resting on Harry\u2019s skin. \u201cI just\u2026 taught myself, last year. When, you know, we were hiding out. There were days and days just hanging around, and when my wand got broken, I had plenty of time to practise.\u201d</p>\n<p>The light at Malfoy\u2019s fingertips wavered and died again, making Harry realise how much the room had darkened as they worked. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Harry whispered, and lifted his own fingers, looking at Malfoy\u2019s face by the light he had conjured.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took my wand. At the Manor,\u201d Malfoy said, his face unsmiling, the lines of it starkly beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI needed one. Wandless magic wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Hurt flickered across Malfoy\u2019s face and it made Harry\u2019s voice gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s a good wand. It helped me a lot.\u201d He wanted to run his hand along Malfoy\u2019s jaw. Light it up with his fingers. He wanted to trace the sharp contours with his lips and taste Malfoy\u2019s skin, again and again.</p>\n<p>Malfoy caught Harry\u2019s hand in his and squeezed, making pain flare for a moment, and muffling the light. \u201cI hated you for it,\u201d Malfoy hissed. \u201cI felt so fucking powerless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were all powerless.\u201d Harry said. \u201cI was just trying to survive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d He seemed to notice his grip on Harry\u2019s hand, then, and released the pressure. For a brief second, he turned to nuzzle it, his lips brushing against the glow of Harry\u2019s fingers, kindled with gold. Then he lay it down on Harry\u2019s lap. He took a couple of deep breaths and when he spoke again his voice was steadier. \u201cIsn\u2019t it dinner time? Why don\u2019t we get some food and then come back here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe can practise some more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Malfoy let his fingers slide over Harry\u2019s knee. Across his thigh. \u201cWe can practise lots of things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry reached for him, but Malfoy evaded his grasp and stood up. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take you long to get the hang of <em>Lumos</em>,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s mouth quirked up on one side. \u201cIt really didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could try it wordlessly next time. It\u2019s just habit, to use the incantation as well. You don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy seemed to like the thought, his lips curving into a smile as they went down the stairs. Harry was still giddy with the breathless feeling of watching Malfoy cast without his wand. They would be at the Great Hall soon, and Malfoy would be far away at the Slytherin table, and Harry would be left thinking about how it had been, and wishing\u2026 maybe wishing he had done the thing he most wanted to do.</p>\n<p>Wanking was one thing, wasn\u2019t it? The kind of stuff that loads of boys did together, according to Malfoy. Kissing was something entirely different. But as Harry looked at Malfoy again, at the faint flush of satisfaction on his cheeks, even the thought that someone might come and find them wasn\u2019t enough to keep him from grabbing Malfoy\u2019s hand and pulling him to one side. Harry leaned in, his blood thrilling with nerves, with desire, and oh, god, the look on Malfoy\u2019s face as he realised what Harry was going to do. It made something inside Harry blaze, so bright, so fierce, that he had to close his eyes as he leaned closer, his lips parting, holding his breath for the moment when he felt Malfoy\u2019s mouth against his. Malfoy made a small sound of surprise, a soft <em>oh</em>, and Harry felt that sound right through him, too, and everything seemed to hang in the air for the moment before their lips touched.</p>\n<p>Then a door banged open and Malfoy\u2019s hand jerked in his, and time started again, and everything was going in the wrong direction. Malfoy pulled away, his face guarded, his hand instinctively going to his wand. Ron stood in the doorway that led to the Long Gallery, blinking at both of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Ron\u2019s face was thunderstruck. Harry would have expected horror, but this was worse \u2013 he looked <em>betrayed</em>. Guilt and shame flooded through Harry, hot nauseous pangs that gripped at his guts. Why had he kept all of this from Ron? Oh, god, his best friend, and he hadn\u2019t even been able to tell him something so important.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Ron. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But it was. It <em>was</em>. Harry had lied to him. How could he explain? He\u2019d thought that when he first told someone about this, Hermione would be there, and she would help him find the right words and explain in her sensible way how it had all come about.</p>\n<p>He tried to say, <em>It\u2019s nothing like you think,</em> but his throat felt jagged inside. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Harry gritted out, and then the words got stuck. A spineless little part of him thought <em>Now Ron knows. Soon everyone will know. That you like blokes. The whole world will know that Harry Potter is gay for Draco Malfoy.</em> And he was ashamed of the part of him that wanted to find a safe, dark place to hide.</p>\n<p>Ron stood there, still dumbfounded with surprise and looking as if Harry had punched him without warning. But when Harry glanced at Malfoy, he realised Ron was actually taking it pretty well. Malfoy\u2019s face was white and pinched with shock, and Harry remembered vividly his lacerated body on a bathroom floor.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s nothing</em>. Had he really said that? Harry swayed on the spot, feeling as helpless as he had when Malfoy had reeled back from Sectumsempra and hit the ground. <em>No, no, I didn\u2019t mean it.</em> But it was as poor an excuse as the first time, and his throat was so tight it was choking him. He should know by now the damage that words could do.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco.\u201d It sounded like a plea, but Malfoy\u2019s face was now shuttered tight, his eyes wintry, and he turned to go. When Harry grabbed his arm, it was unyielding as stone. \u201cWait,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Malfoy turned back, his throat working. Then he lifted his chin and his mouth twisted into an ugly sneer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d Harry croaked, but Malfoy gave him no chance to finish.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, Gryffindors.\u201d His accent was like cut glass all of a sudden. \u201cAll this angsting over a few crappy hand jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hand jobs</em>?\u201d Ron\u2019s tone of bewildered incomprehension would probably have been funny at any other time, but god, not now. Was that what Malfoy thought, then? They probably had been crappy. Harry had never imagined that he was any good at sex, but Malfoy hadn\u2019t seemed to mind before.</p>\n<p>Harry opened his mouth to\u2014 he didn\u2019t know what. To apologise? To try to explain? Or maybe to shout something angry and desperate and painful, but Malfoy was walking away, too fast, and it all seemed pointless. Harry felt weirdly numb. Like the time his knife had slipped in Potions, once, sliced deep into his finger and Harry had watched with an odd detachment as the blood began to well up. The pain hadn\u2019t come until later.</p>\n<p>Malfoy turned the corner and was gone in a swirl of robes. Harry stared at the empty space where he had stood. He had nearly kissed him. So nearly.</p>\n<p>Ron had managed to shut his mouth, but his eyes were wide. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the bloody hell\u2019s been going on, but I reckon you\u2019ve fucked that right up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words spurred Harry into motion. He couldn\u2019t let this end here, no matter what. This glorious, shining thing, broken to bits by a couple of careless words. \u201cI need to go,\u201d he blurted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, OK then.\u201d Ron shook his head, bewildered. \u201cTell me some other time what the fuck this is about, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will. Sorry.\u201d Harry darted along the corridor. Where would Malfoy be? Not in the Great Hall, surely? By the Lake? He hesitated, then doubled back to their room and started rummaging in his trunk. His fingers were shaking so that the map fell from his hands at first, but he scooped it up again. \u201c<em>I solemnly swear that I am up to no good</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shit, shit, shit, shit. Where was Malfoy? He\u2019d lost so much time already. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to say when he found him, but he knew he had to try. The parchment swarmed with tiny footprints, and at first, Harry couldn\u2019t see Draco\u2019s name anywhere, but then he spotted the small dot in the corner of the middle courtyard.</p>\n<p>The quickest way would be along the second floor and then down the steps towards the library. Harry was nearly there when one of the shitty bastard staircases moved and he had to dart around to the south instead. Harry raced along, then stopped, heart thumping, at the top of the stairs to peer out of the window. <em>Yes</em>. Malfoy was down there, sitting on a stone bench in the shadows of the courtyard, barely visible from the castle but for his bright head of hair. Harry felt a swell of relief, but before he could turn to hurry down the stairs, another cloaked figure stepped into view and began to cross the courtyard towards Malfoy.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Theodore Nott.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s stomach rolled with anxiety, but he seemed unable to move until he had seen what Nott was up to. Nott\u2019s face was alight with interest as he walked quickly over the stone flags to where Malfoy was sitting. Malfoy looked up at Nott, unsmiling, and Harry\u2019s heart thudded into his boots at the cold, closed off look on his face.</p>\n<p>He wished he could hear what Nott was saying. Malfoy shook his head, and Harry leaned forwards to get a better look until the glass in front of him fogged with his breath. He scrubbed at it with his sleeve until he could see the figures below once more.</p>\n<p>Nott seemed to be talking, while Malfoy stared at the ground in front of his feet. Nott took Malfoy\u2019s arm, his head tilted to one side in invitation, and Harry felt a stab of something hot and sharp in his chest. He could guess exactly what Nott was trying to talk Malfoy into. Malfoy looked up at Nott again, his expression bitter in a way Harry hadn\u2019t seen for quite a while. Then Malfoy seemed to come to a sudden decision; this time, when Nott tugged him by the hand, he yielded, his body unfolding as he got to his feet. Harry could barely stand to look at Nott\u2019s sly face, but he watched all the same as Nott led Malfoy away, pulling him by the hand around the courtyard and through the gate that led to the greenhouses.</p>\n<p>Harry stood for a moment, picturing Nott\u2019s look of triumph. He felt sick. But sick didn\u2019t begin to cover it. It was nausea, hot knives of it twisting in his gut. And then his feet were moving again, propelled forward by the need to get to Malfoy and see where that bastard Nott was taking him.</p>\n<p>Harry stumbled on the stairs, almost tripping and tumbling headlong on the stone. \u201cSteady, my lad,\u201d warned a portrait of a wizard in a feathered hat. But Harry hurried onwards, anger and misery warring in his throat as he reached the foot of the stairs and flung open the door to the courtyard. How dare Nott just take Malfoy\u2019s hand like that? As if it meant nothing. Harry knew what he was after. All Nott wanted was a warm body to get off with, but Malfoy should know that this meant so much more to Harry than that. He should fucking know\u2014</p>\n<p>Except that Harry had never told Malfoy.</p>\n<p>In fact, Harry had never really even admitted it to himself, had he? That this was so much more than getting off.</p>\n<p>And all Harry had found to say to Ron was that this was <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s bastarding bollocks, Harry was an arsehole.</p>\n<p>He banged through the gate, furious with Nott, furious with Malfoy, furious most of all with himself, then rounded the corner and found Nott and Malfoy at the other end of the path. Nott was pressing Malfoy up against the wall, his hands under Malfoy\u2019s robes while Harry stopped in his tracks, a savage roar of jealousy thrashing inside him, pure and deadly. Nott bent to say something into Malfoy\u2019s ear and the casual intimacy of it tore at Harry, but he couldn\u2019t stop watching.</p>\n<p>Malfoy didn\u2019t look as if he was enjoying any of it, leaning against the wall with a vacant look on his face, but neither did he do anything to stop it. Nott didn\u2019t seem to care either way, his hands moving greedily to push Malfoy\u2019s shirt up. Malfoy stared into space over Nott\u2019s shoulder, his face stony, and then Harry watched in horror as Nott reached to cup the bulge between Malfoy\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p>A searing hatred jolted through Harry, deep from his core, burning along his veins and into his palm and out to his fingertips, fast and fiery and <em>fuck</em>, the thing with using wandless magic a lot was that apparently sometimes it happened when it really shouldn\u2019t. The Hex, or Curse \u2013 Harry didn\u2019t even know what the spell <em>was</em>, and shit, he of all people knew the damage <em>that</em> could do \u2013 flew through his fingers, starting to race towards Nott until Harry managed to get control of his magic and used every bit of power he had to rein it in. He was trying to stop it dead, halt the spell in mid air before it could reach Nott, but he did more than that. He pulled the fucking spell <em>back</em>, back into his own body, and cried out in pain as the unknown magic scalded its way along his arm.</p>\n<p>Harry sank down onto his knees, his body shaking. <em>Merlin, what had he done?</em> It felt bad. About as bad as anything he could remember. The pain reached his chest and for a few long moments he thought he might pass out. \u201cShit,\u201d he gasped, but it came out more like \u201cShiiii-hurrr.\u201d</p>\n<p>He huddled there on the ground, violent red splotches before his eyes, and then Malfoy was standing above him, his face still cold. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>The pain ebbed for a moment, then flooded back, blistering over his ribs. \u201cH\u2013 Hexed myself. Or something. Fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Malfoy tried to sneer, but there was a hint of something else underneath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Harry tried to get up, then thought better of it, and crouched panting on the stony path. \u201cWhat I said. Wasn\u2019t\u2013 true. Wasn\u2019t nothing. No way. It was\u2013 it was fucking <em>everything</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I get it. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want your dirty little secret to get round the school.\u201d His mouth trembled on the word <em>secret</em> and at last, at last Harry began to see exactly how all of this looked to Malfoy, and god, it was grim.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not true.\u201d Breathing hurt, but not as much as the prickling torment at his fingertips.</p>\n<p>Another pair of legs joined Malfoy\u2019s. \u201cWhat is Potter doing down there?\u201d Nott\u2019s superior tone made Harry want to Hex him all over again.</p>\n<p>\u201cPiss off, Nott,\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, piss right off,\u201d Harry managed to grit out, but something seriously wrong was happening inside his chest, crushing it like a vice, and his vision was starting to go white around the edges. He couldn\u2019t see Nott, but he could still hear his snooty voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin. Like that, is it?\u201d Nott made a contemptuous noise. \u201cYou\u2019ve done some stupid things in your time, Draco, but falling for Harry Potter has to be the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry considered Hexing him for real this time, but the pain was becoming unbearable, and then the rushing whiteness closed in, and the last thing Harry felt was the stones of the path jabbing at his face as he hit the ground.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>The first thing he noticed was the sharp smell of herbs. <em>Dittany</em>, he thought, and then, <em>oh shit</em>.</p>\n<p>He opened his eyes and, <em>yes, fuck</em>, he was in the hospital wing, and god, it hurt to breathe, a tearing pain in his lungs with every inhalation, bad enough to let out an anguished moan.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned his head with difficulty. She was sitting on the other side of the bed, her hair pulled back into a ponytail and her face pale and tired.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione,\u201d he croaked, and then, \u201cUgh. Hurts. Bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrink this,\u201d she said. \u201cMadam Pomfrey left it in case you woke up. You were stirring this morning, so we hoped\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She helped him lift his head enough to sip at a vile lemon-coloured concoction. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Harry protested at the taste, the bitterness of it and then the sharp peppery afterburn. But even as he struggled to get it down, he could feel the pain receding until it was only an ache.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that better? What on earth happened?\u201d Hermione asked, and memories started to slowly surface.</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s face as Harry leaned in to kiss him. Malfoy\u2019s face as Harry told Ron it was <em>nothing</em>. And then, the cold, hard look he gave Harry after Harry had pulled the spell back into himself. Harry\u2019s face screwed up in misery and Hermione leaned forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it worse? Oh, I should get Madam Pomfrey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry forced out. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He lay back, trembling slightly. \u201cWhere\u2019s Draco?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco?\u201d Hermione wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in class, I suppose. I think it\u2019s time for Charms? Look, Harry, I think I should fetch Pomfrey...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said forcefully, reaching out to grab her arm, then drawing back as a fresh wave of pain hit him. He held up his hand to see, and oh, wow. His fingers were smeared with some kind of sticky ointment, but underneath he could see they were blistered and cracked. \u201cOh, hell.\u201d He turned his hand from side to side to see better. Two of his nails were charred, and streaks of angry red ran from his index finger along his wrist and all the way up his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened, Harry? Did <em>Malfoy</em> do something to you? They checked his wand, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no it wasn\u2019t him. God, no. It was me,\u201d Harry told her, but her look of worry and confusion only grew. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re missing <em>classes</em> to be here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course. Madam Pomfrey has loads of other patients \u2013 there\u2019s an outbreak of Dragon Pox among the first years \u2013 and we didn\u2019t want you to be on your own when you woke up, not after being unconscious for so long\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat up a bit more. \u201cWhat? How long have I been here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d Hermione said, her voice wobbling slightly. \u201cHealers came from St Mungo\u2019s but they didn\u2019t want to move you. Oh Harry, I must fetch her.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Two days</em>. And did Draco still think that Harry was <em>ashamed</em> of what they\u2019d done? God, he\u2019d been such an idiot. Harry sat up again. \u201cMe and Malfoy, we\u2019ve been\u2026\u201d <em>Wanking together all the time</em> didn\u2019t sound that great, did it? \u201cI mean, I\u2026 we\u2019ve been... \u201c He took a deep breath. \u201cSeeing each other. In secret. I really need to speak to him, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cOh, Harry. Ron said something, but I thought maybe he\u2019d misunderstood, and then\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>need</em> to see him.\u201d Harry swung his legs around, and tried to get off the bed, but was stopped in his tracks by a sudden lurch of pain in his chest, and then a shocked cry came from across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d Pomfrey\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cWhat in the name of Merlin do you think you are doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry set his jaw stubbornly. \u201cThere\u2019s someone I need to speak to. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you lost your senses? You\u2019ve been out cold for two days with some of the worst spell damage I\u2019ve ever seen in a student. Get back on that bed immediately and don\u2019t even think about moving.\u201d She bustled over and set down an armful of potions and ointments on the bedside table. \u201cRight. We have work to do. Miss Granger, you can return to classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I stay?\u201d Hermione asked. \u201cI could help, I won\u2019t be in the way\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Madam Pomfrey looked stern, then caught Hermione\u2019s expression and patted her on the arm. \u201cCome back at teatime. We\u2019ll have him feeling much better by then and you can talk properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione smiled at Harry, her eyes slightly shiny. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later.\u201d She bent to give him the most gentle of hugs, her hands resting lightly on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him to come,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cHe\u2026 might not want to. But tell him. Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>Madam Pomfrey frowned. \u201cTime to go. If you really want to help, you could always have a talk with Potter later about <em>not</em> trying to find new ways to kill himself all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>When Pomfrey had finished with him, Harry felt physically more comfortable, but his mind was a riot of anxiety. What the bloody hell would Malfoy be thinking right now? Did he understand what Harry had been trying to say to him before the curse sucked Harry under? Or did he still think Harry wanted to keep this secret so badly that he would lie to his best friend in front of Malfoy\u2019s face to avoid getting found out? Fucking hell, why had Harry never told Malfoy how he felt? Those moments when they were together, when it felt like Harry could say anything, like anything was possible. Why had he messed that up so badly? He\u2019d talked about the bloody war \u2013 about Malfoy\u2019s <em>mum</em>, for fuck\u2019s sake, when he could have been telling Malfoy what this whole thing had meant to him.</p>\n<p>Damn it all to hell. Harry made a choked sound of frustration which drew Pomfrey back to his bedside.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs the pain worse again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cNot really.\u201d His fingers were throbbing, especially the ones with the scorched nails, but he didn\u2019t care. He deserved it.</p>\n<p>Malfoy had probably decided that Nott was a much better bet. They were probably together, right now, in Harry and Malfoy\u2019s room \u2013 Harry closed his eyes and pushed his face against the pillow to try to blot out the images that his brain was supplying.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s vital that you rest,\u201d Pomfrey was saying. She took a small silvery phial from her apron pocket. \u201cHere. Take this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t take it, I\u2019ll have to use a spell,\u201d she told him, and Harry stretched his hand out in defeat. \u201cDrink, then,\u201d she said, and stood over him to watch him swallow.</p>\n<p><em>Damn everyone and everything</em>. Harry would sleep, then. It was better than being awake and stuck here like this without any clue of what was going on in the outside world. The potion was obviously very fast-working, for he felt lethargy pulling at his limbs already. Within a minute, he was yawning, and within two, he was asleep.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes felt sticky and heavy but he managed to open them. Ron was sitting by the bed reading a magazine.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Ron\u2019s eyebrows shot up in greeting. \u201cYou\u2019re awake again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rubbed his uninjured hand across his face. \u201cUgh. Sleeping potion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Pomfrey said. Shall I call her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry shook his head, although his chest was hurting in that knife-like way again when he breathed in, and he suspected he would have to ask for some more of the lemon-coloured potion soon. \u201cJust talk quietly so she doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m up.\u201d He propped himself upright against the pillows. \u201cI need to apologise to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, if this is about what happened \u2013 you know, what I saw \u2013 before you got hurt, it can wait. Pomfrey explained you need to rest and all of that, and not get wound up about stuff. But bloody hell, how did you end up in the hospital wing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I want to tell you. I should have done it ages ago.\u201d Harry got as comfortable as he could, took a deep breath and started to explain everything. Well. Not everything. He tried to keep the more embarrassing bits to a minimum, to spare both him and Ron. And there were a <em>lot</em> of embarrassing bits, so it was actually fairly brief.</p>\n<p>Ron listened in silence, then nodded. \u201cSo you\u2019re definitely going to be all right? The damage isn't permanent?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry held up his hand and looked at it. The redness had gone down a little along his arm. \u201cI don't think so. Pomfrey chucked a ton of spells and potions at me. The good thing about her is that she never asks many questions. She just tries to fix whatever part of you you\u2019ve fucked up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this thing with Malfoy.\u201d Ron pulled a face. \u201cWow. I never saw that coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave a nervous laugh. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Ron scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cIs it serious or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared at his lap. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know.\u201d He picked at the blanket, pulling off a bobble of wool that had formed. He\u2019d promised himself that he would be honest with Ron. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m serious about him.\u201d <em>There. That wasn\u2019t so difficult</em>. \u201cBut\u2026 I think you\u2019re right. I think I screwed it up.\u201d He tried to swallow down the uncomfortable lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>Ron shook his head. \u201cOh, mate. <em>Malfoy</em>. Really? You\u2019re sure about this? I mean\u2026 I know this is stating the obvious, but he\u2019s a bloke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had noticed that, actually, Ron, but thanks for pointing it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, I just mean\u2026 you never went for blokes before. But, Harry, he\u2019s not just a bloke.\u201d Ron gave Harry a pleading look. \u201cHe\u2019s a git.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that, but have you spent any time with him lately?\u201d Harry frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take my word for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me he\u2019s <em>not</em> a git any more? Not at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake\u2026\u201d Harry glared at Ron. \u201cHe is still a bit of a git. OK?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron jerked his chin upwards smugly. \u201cKnew it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I like gits.\u201d Harry settled back on the pillows and shut his eyes. \u201cDid you think of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did ask after you, though,\u201d Ron went on.</p>\n<p>Harry eyes snapped open. \u201cWhat? When was this?\u201d he demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYesterday. Asked if I knew anything about how you were.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat up straight, ignoring the pain in his side. \u201cRon. What were his exact words? How did he say it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t bloody know! He came up to me after Potions. And he said it\u2026 I dunno, he said it with his mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, funny.\u201d Harry grimaced. \u201cI mean, did he smile? Did he look\u2026 I dunno, worried?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron gazed at Harry as if he were mad. \u201cHe looked how he always looked. A bit sneery. Like he could hardly be bothered to even speak.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see? A git,\u201d Ron said. \u201cI told him I didn\u2019t know anything, because at the time, I didn\u2019t. You were still out cold. And look where chasing after him has got you. In the bloody hospital wing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Madam Pomfrey\u2019s shoes must have specially quiet soles for creeping up on people, Harry thought, as she appeared over Ron\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPretty much everything Potter does gets him in the hospital wing,\u201d she said drily. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Like crap</em>. \u201cOK,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cTime for more potions,\u201d she told him, measuring out a large dose of the lemon-yellow one, to Harry\u2019s relief.</p>\n<p>He swallowed it down and shuddered. \u201cUgh. Do you know if Hermione\u2019s spoken to him?\u201d Harry asked Ron quietly, aware of Madam Pomfrey nearby, uncorking another bottle.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. Hardly seen her all day, she had loads of classes to catch up on. I\u2019m meeting her at\u2013 oh, bloody hell. I\u2019d better go. Is that all right, mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCourse,\u201d Harry said. He could feel the numbing power of the potion spreading through his veins. He thought about asking Ron to speak to Malfoy, but that probably wasn\u2019t the best idea in the world. \u201cI\u2019ll maybe see you later?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough visitors for one day.\u201d She shooed Ron away.</p>\n<p>Harry screwed up his face in vexation, but he knew from experience it was useless to argue. \u201cIf anyone does come, though, you will tell me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>She peered at him with surprisingly soft eyes. \u201cPotter. Whoever this <em>him</em> is that you\u2019re so worried about... if he\u2019s worth worrying over, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll still be there when you\u2019re better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes prickled suddenly at her words. He knew she meant it kindly, but if only it were true. He\u2019d felt such a flash of hope when Ron had said Malfoy asked after him\u2026 but now he realised Malfoy was probably just feeling guilty about what had happened to Harry. Not that it was Malfoy's fault, or anything, but he probably wanted to put his mind at rest. <em>So he could feel fine about shagging Theo Nott</em>, Harry\u2019s brain told him helpfully, supplying images of Malfoy and Nott entwined.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d Pomfrey said. \u201cYou have got it bad.\u201d She passed him the next dose of potion. \u201cListen to me, Potter, I know it seems that way now, but the world doesn\u2019t end because of a love affair gone wrong.\u201d She turned away and wiped her hands on her apron, sighing to herself. \u201cLife goes on, believe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was two in the morning, and there was no way in the world that Harry was ever going to get to sleep. His burned fingers throbbed with pain, but far worse was the ache in his chest which he didn\u2019t think was anything to do with spell damage. Everything was wrong here: the loathed smell of Dittany, the way every sound echoed coldly around the bare room, and the stark loneliness of his narrow bed. He longed for the neat little room in the Astronomy wing. But most of all, he longed for Draco. \u201c<em>Draco</em>\u201d, Harry whispered to himself, and the name was as intoxicating on his lips as a first kiss. He wasn\u2019t <em>Malfoy</em>, not any more. Not in Harry\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>He thought of Draco in the next bed, the soft sound of his breathing. The sounds Harry had heard him make when he touched himself. When Harry had touched him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Why don\u2019t you come over here?</em>\n</p>\n<p>He remembered the shock those words had sent right through his body, like a jolt of electricity. The thought of it made him groan aloud even now. He didn\u2019t think six hotter words had ever been spoken since time began.</p>\n<p>Harry thought he would do pretty much <em>anything</em> if he could only hear those words again now.</p>\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t just the memories of Draco\u2019s body and Draco\u2019s hands, even though, hell, they were like nothing he\u2019d ever felt. It was more than that.</p>\n<p>It was sitting in the dusky light together, with low voices, Draco\u2019s hand resting in his. It was the feeling that anything was possible. That the war was something that could be left in the past.</p>\n<p>And oh god \u2013 the thought struck him like <em>Stupefy</em>. What if Draco showed Nott how to do <em>Lumos</em>? Harry felt as if something inside of him was tearing apart. The thought of Draco sharing the things Harry had shown him with someone else was somehow the most unbearable of all.</p>\n<p>It was almost enough to drive him to use the silvery phial Madam Pomfrey had left for him. Almost. Instead Harry lay in the dark for what seemed like hour upon hour, remembering how Draco\u2019s face had looked as he conjured light from his fingers. The night seemed it would never end, until at last sleep washed over him like a great wave and dragged him under.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>In the morning when Harry woke, Pomfrey was at his bedside.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour arm is looking better,\u201d she said. \u201cNot bad progress, considering what a state you got yourself into this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, honestly,\u201d Harry told her. And he did feel a lot better, physically at least. His lungs didn\u2019t burn with each breath, and the red streaking on his arm had faded even further. \u201cMaybe I could get up today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to be joking,\u201d she told him, holding her wand over his chest and noting the result on a piece of parchment. \u201cOh, Professor McGonagall called in to see you. She wants to investigate this whole matter thoroughly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s heart sank.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need to look like that. I told her you were not to be disturbed. You need rest, and lots of it.\u201d And she left him in peace.</p>\n<p>It seemed like one of the longest days of Harry\u2019s life. Nobody visited \u2013 or Pomfrey didn\u2019t let anyone in, Harry wasn\u2019t sure \u2013 until after lunch, when Hermione dropped in with an armful of parchment scrolls. \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t want to get behind on our NEWTs work, so I brought you these.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder and spoke quietly. \u201cMadam Pomfrey says we\u2019re not to question you about any of it in case it upsets you. But if you wanted to tell me anything\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cI do want to. And I will, I promise. But she\u2019s probably going to kick you out in a minute, and I just need to know \u2013 did you talk to Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione looked serious. \u201cI caught up with him after Herbology yesterday. I told him that you were awake. And that you were asking for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d His pulse was hammering in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Harry.\u201d Her face twisted miserably. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. Just looked down his nose, in that way he has, you know, and walked off, like I\u2019d offended him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s heart felt like it had dropped down to his knees. No, right onto the fucking floor. Ready to be stomped on. \u201cOh. Right.\u201d So that was it. Draco wasn\u2019t coming. He didn\u2019t want to see Harry. Probably wouldn\u2019t speak to him, even if Harry could get a chance. Which he couldn\u2019t, not stuck here like this in this fucking bed...</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Harry.\u201d Hermione made a sympathetic face, and that was almost more than he could take.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, but it came out weirdly strangled and he couldn\u2019t remember how to swallow without it hurting.</p>\n<p>Right on cue, Madam Pomfrey was at his bedside. \u201cThat looks like quite enough for now,\u201d she said firmly.</p>\n<p>Hermione got up reluctantly. \u201cI can try again, if you like?\u201d she asked Harry. \u201cI mean, perhaps he didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Her voice trailed away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThanks. But forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Pomfrey suggested something to help him rest again, Harry didn\u2019t even argue.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry slept for hours, thanks to Pomfrey\u2019s silver bottle. At first, the numb, blank sleep that came from a potion, but then he shifted into a lighter sleep where he dreamed, horrible dreams of loss and longing and regret that seemed to have no end.</p>\n<p>Draco was falling through the Veil, the black tattered fabric rippling around his body as it sucked him in, and Harry trying to reach for him, his arm outstretched, over and over again. However many times he tried, he couldn\u2019t save him, and worst of all, Harry somehow knew, in the hopeless way one did in dreams, that he himself had cast the spell which propelled Draco through the archway and into the space beyond.</p>\n<p>Harry thought he woke up, sweat on his top lip and a cry in his throat, but it was still part of the dream and Draco was still falling, endlessly, falling, and nothing Harry could do could save him.</p>\n<p>Then the dream changed. Harry woke up in the hospital wing again and it seemed so real. He could smell the Dittany, and his burned fingers were throbbing gently.</p>\n<p>He opened his eyes and Draco was there by the bed. He was wrapped up in a big cloak with his legs tucked up on the chair, the soft glow of <em>Lumos</em> blooming at his fingertips and illuminating his face.\u00a0Draco sat watching the light, turning his fingers this way and that so that <em>Lumos</em> danced over the angles of his cheeks, his brow, his sharp profile and the curve of his lips. He took Harry\u2019s breath away. It seemed such a cruel dream to have right now \u2013 it was so glorious, but Harry knew it was just his mind playing tricks.</p>\n<p>He lay there watching quietly, not wanting the dream to end, and then Draco noticed Harry\u2019s eyes were open.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. You\u2019re alive.\u201d His voice was haughty as ever, but there was something soft about his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Harry croaked.</p>\n<p>He tilted his head and gave Harry a guarded look. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Draco\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed and as the <em>Lumos</em> flickered over his skin, Harry saw the dark shadows under his eyes were back. \u201cSo I thought I might as well come and ask what the fuck happened the other night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a dream, right?\u201d Harry asked, and Draco laughed, a small, tight sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could be. If you want it to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scrambled to sit up. \u201cI wanted to see you so much,\u201d he said, and he felt a fresh wave of grief wash over him.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes flicked over Harry\u2019s face, and Harry swore he saw a flash of longing in his eyes, but when Draco spoke, he sounded quite offhand. \u201cSo what happened to you? They keep asking me, so I thought I had better come and find out before they decide it <em>was</em> my fault after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI Hexed Nott, or something. When I saw him with you. Well, Pomfrey says it was more like a curse. I didn\u2019t mean to, it just\u2026 happened without thinking. You know. Like <em>Lumos</em>.\u201d Harry attempted a smile, but he felt too rubbish to make it stick.</p>\n<p>Draco just looked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never meant to do it. I wouldn\u2019t go around cursing people because\u2014 \u201c Harry swallowed hard. \u201cBecause they touch you, or something. So I \u2013tried to stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I sort of\u2026 pulled it back into me. The spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes were narrow. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. It happened, though.\u201d Harry splayed a hand over his ribs. \u201cIt hurt like a bastard. Still aches now. And I slept for two days or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a fucking Gryffindor lunatic,\u201d Draco said emphatically, and it was so exactly what he would say in real life, that Harry knew for sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head. \u201cNo, Potter. It\u2019s not,\u201d and he sounded bitter again. \u201cThis is real life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen\u2013 I can tell you I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d Harry tried to reach for Draco\u2019s hand, but he pulled it away. \u201cI\u2019ve been lying here and trying to work out how I can make it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco didn\u2019t seem to take in what Harry was saying. \u201cYou should probably know. Nott\u2019s told some people that there was something going on between you and me. I tried to stop him, but\u2026\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cHe wanted me to do certain things for him, and I wouldn\u2019t do them, so\u2026\u201d Draco let out a long breath. \u201cI expect people will get bored and find something else to talk about eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Harry said. \u201cI mean \u2013 if you were OK with it, I\u2019d tell them myself. I told Ron and Hermione already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco narrowed his eyes again. \u201cTold them? Told them <em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow I feel about you. That I\u2013 I want to be with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked stunned, but then: \u201cThat\u2019s not what you said to Weasley before.\u201d His mouth twisted into a bitter shape, and his <em>Lumos</em> flickered and went out.</p>\n<p>Harry groped for his wand and set it on the bedside table with its tip alight.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah I know. That was shit.\u201d He\u2019d run through it all in his head, but now Draco was there, he wasn\u2019t sure if he could find the words to explain. \u201cI felt so bloody awful when Ron found out like that. He probably still thought I was going to marry his sister one day.\u201d This was no use. He was getting it all wrong. He carried on anyway, his voice cracking. \u201cBut I really fucked things up, didn\u2019t I? I don\u2019t want it to be a secret. This isn\u2019t <em>nothing</em>. It\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to me for\u2013 for a bloody long time. The best thing I could imagine happening to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tried taking Draco\u2019s hand again, and this time Draco let him, and Harry felt hope darting in his chest, vivid and irrepressible. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSo fucking much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco blinked, looking a bit startled, but then he said, \u201cWell. Our room has been a bit dull without you blundering about and tripping over stuff, I have to admit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wanted to run up and down the ward shouting stupid things and possibly singing, but he thought he\u2019d probably regret that, so he just said, \u201cWhen I woke up. You were doing <em>Lumos</em>. I\u2019ve missed that, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been practising. But it wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d He lifted his eyes to Harry\u2019s. \u201cLots of things weren\u2019t the same without you there.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh, Merlin</em>. Harry\u2019s mouth was dry just imagining Draco alone in their room. But maybe Harry was misunderstanding. <em>Had</em> he been alone?</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout those <em>things</em> Nott wanted you to do.\u201d Harry felt the low growl of jealousy in his chest again. \u201cWhat were they?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked at him steadily. \u201cYou know what things, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t want to?\u201d Harry\u2019s throat was scratchy, making the words come out roughly.</p>\n<p>Draco raised his chin. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you go with him the other time?\u201d Harry demanded. \u201cDid he threaten you or something? Because if he did, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what? Go and curse your other arm off to spite him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t do anything like that. But, seriously, if he\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t threaten me. He just\u2026 wanted me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s face screwed up. Nott <em>wanted</em> Draco? Of course he did, anyone who had eyes would want him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he was honest about it,\u201d Draco said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t, you know, he wasn\u2019t ashamed to be seen with me.\u201d The bitterness in his tone made Harry wince. \u201cAt that precise moment, I thought it was better than a kick in the teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> want you.\u201d Harry glared at him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not ashamed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed down the discomfort in his throat. \u201cYou said that night that I was an idiot. And you were right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I was. You\u2019re a total fucking idiot,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell, Malfoy,\u201d Harry growled. \u201cI\u2019m trying to apologise here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you call it?\u201d Draco\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI think there could be a hell of a lot more grovelling, personally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to grovel, you bastard. But I want you.\u201d It made his face flush to say it, but Harry pressed on. \u201cYou must know it. I\u2019ve wanted you pretty much every minute since I bloody saw you at the start of term.\u201d The admission shook him with its truth. \u201cI want you right now,\u201d he said simply.</p>\n<p>Draco fell silent, his gaze lingering on Harry\u2019s mouth. Then he said quietly, \u201cYou do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMy hand is a bit fucked at the moment and I\u2019m probably, you know, pretty crap at it, like you said. But I do want you. And maybe I could learn what you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Draco was staring at Harry, his voice low, and the look of challenge in his eyes made heat flare inside Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s easy to say. How about you show me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t hesitate, but leaned forwards and reached for Draco, letting his hand run along his waist, feeling for the shape of his body through the thick folds of his cloak. Draco\u2019s lips parted, and Harry held his breath as he found the fastening of Draco\u2019s cloak and slipped his hand inside. <em>Shit</em>. Draco was just wearing his thin cotton pyjama trousers underneath. His chest was bare, and he closed his eyes and moaned as Harry\u2019s fingers skimmed over his stomach.</p>\n<p>Harry had to have him \u2013 all of him. \u201cDraco,\u201d he groaned. He couldn\u2019t wait. It had been much too long. \u201cCome over here. In the bed with me. Will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes darted to the curtains pulled around Harry\u2019s bed. \u201cAre you serious? What if Pomfrey comes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d said Harry, hoping his optimism was not misplaced.</p>\n<p>Draco wet his lips, but he looked pretty keen. \u201cWe\u2019d have to be really quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m good at that,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, you\u2019re utterly shit at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on. I will be this time. We won\u2019t get caught.\u201d Harry moved over on the narrow bed, and Draco shucked off his cloak and climbed in beside him.</p>\n<p>Harry reached for Draco eagerly and then let out a stifled yelp of pain. \u201cUgh,\u201d he said. \u201cWrong hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Draco whispered. \u201cWe need to be fast, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really <em>am</em> good at that,\u201d Harry admitted, and Draco snorted, wasting no time in nudging Harry\u2019s trousers around his thighs so that his cock bounced free against his stomach. Harry kicked them all the way off under the bedclothes, not wanting anything to get between him and Draco, sighing at the feel of Draco\u2019s skin against his.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s hands were gentler than usual, one in Harry\u2019s hair and one moving, deft and delicious, drawing long sighs of pleasure and need from Harry. Draco dragged his fingers lightly through the curls at the base of Harry\u2019s cock, and Harry let out a sound like steam escaping from a kettle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of fool burns their wanking hand with their own spell?\u201d Draco whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone who \u2013 <em>ahhh</em> \u2013 has someone else to \u2013 oh, <em>Merlin</em> \u2013 do it for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco responded by twisting the hand that rested in Harry\u2019s hair, just hard enough to hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uhh</em>. Someone amazing,\u201d Harry assured him. \u201cYou\u2019re much better at it than I am, anyway. Oh <em>fuck</em> yes.\u201d Harry\u2019s cock jerked as Draco pushed his knees apart and wanked the full length of his shaft, slow and intense and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Draco whispered, and Harry\u2019s heart lurched in his chest. Of course Draco would know. He\u2019d probably been with dozens of boys, and they\u2019d probably all told him how good he was, how talented his hands were, the things his body made them want to do. And what things <em>had</em> he done, with other boys? How soon before he got bored of Harry\u2019s fumbling inexperience and went somewhere else?</p>\n<p>The words stuck in Harry\u2019s throat, but he forced them out anyway. He had to know. \u201cAre you going to go with him again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s hand slowed. \u201cWho? Theo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry winced at the easy intimacy of the name. \u201cYeah. Are you going to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes were intent on Harry\u2019s face.\u201cWhat if I did? Would you curse him again?\u201d His hands, god, his hands. The rhythm of it, the slow, heavenly ache of it. Harry tried to thrust upwards, but Draco pushed him back down. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI might want to, but\u2013 no. I wouldn\u2019t do that. Not on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d want to?\u201d Draco asked. His voice sounded throaty and it made Harry\u2019s stomach clench with arousal. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>God, his mouth. Harry stared at the soft curve of his lips, the way they parted as Harry let out another moan. Harry was so close, already, and he felt like he might say anything. \u201cBecause\u2013 I don\u2019t want you to do this with anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco took his bottom lip between his teeth, his eyes running over Harry\u2019s face. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Harry said, and then cried out as Draco moved his wrist in that way he had, sending hot shivers of bliss rippling through Harry\u2019s balls, the pressure building. His enjoyment was given a cruel edge by the unwelcome thought of Draco being like this with anybody but him. \u201cJust me,\u201d Harry gritted out, and there was something fierce about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust you?\u201d Draco whispered, his pupils wide and black, and <em>god</em>, Harry wanted to weep at the delicious torment of his touch, the teasing, wicked way he brought Harry to the edge, right to the edge, then left him dangling there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry told him. \u201cGod, do it like that\u2013 uhhh. Yes, yes, <em>please</em>, Malfoy.\u201d He was trying to keep quiet, but he could hear the rawness of his own desperation. \u201cJust me, please <em>oh god</em>, yes, just me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Draco said. He sounded breathless. \u201cJust you,\u201d and Harry reached for him, caring nothing for the sudden stab of pain in his fingers. His hand cupped the back of Draco\u2019s head and pulled him in, and Draco\u2019s mouth was so hot, so soft, and so willing. His lips opened against Harry\u2019s, his tongue sliding like honey, and Harry tried to hold on, to make it last, but his body was already flooding with pleasure. He groaned into Draco\u2019s mouth, coming and coming until he was shaking with it, and Draco kissed him all through it and then pushed him down onto the pillows to kiss him some more.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s kisses quickly changed from sensual to hungry, and he made noises, too, all sorts of noises, and it occurred to Harry that maybe he wasn\u2019t so bad at this, after all. \u201cNot so loud, remember?\u201d Harry whispered, but god, he wanted to hear him, wanted to urge Draco on until the whole school could hear. His left hand felt so stiff and clumsy, but it only took a minute before Draco was coming too, pressing his face into Harry\u2019s hair to muffle his cry.</p>\n<p>Harry cleaned them both up and then wrapped his good arm around Draco\u2019s waist. He lay nuzzling the crook of Draco\u2019s neck, breathing the familiar scent of ginger, with Draco\u2019s skin so warm and clean-smelling underneath, and in barely two minutes, Harry was asleep.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>When Harry woke, it was very early and Draco was still in bed with him, their legs entangled, Draco\u2019s face soft and relaxed. His jaw was mottled with pink, the telltale scratch of Harry\u2019s stubble on his fine skin, and Harry felt a fierce purr of approval at the thought that he had marked Draco in this way. That people might see, and guess, and\u2014</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s cock had twitched determinedly to life at the sight of Draco next to him, but he stayed still with his eyes closed, enjoying the pressure of Draco\u2019s bare leg thrust in between his, and the steady sound of his breathing. He lay there, feeling full of more emotions than he had words for, until he heard the rustle of skirts and opened his eyes to see Madam Pomfrey standing by the bed with an expression of dismay on her face.</p>\n<p>Harry froze, but didn\u2019t speak, begging her silently not to cause the unholy row he knew she was capable of.</p>\n<p>Draco stirred in his sleep and shifted a little closer. Oh, god. Why did they both have to be so very naked? Draco lay there with the signs of last night\u2019s activities written on his face, his hair rumpled, the lean lines of his body covered only by a thin sheet, and as Madam Pomfrey stood there, shocked, Draco sighed and mumbled, \u201cHarry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pomfrey watched all this without comment, and her expression took on a strangely conflicted look. She frowned, then seemed to come to a decision. \u201cI think I need a cup of tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>She spoke quietly, but Draco\u2019s eyes flicked open immediately and Harry felt him start in horror.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am going to go and make myself a pot of Assam, and forget that I ever saw this.\u201d Her brows drew together firmly. \u201cWhen I come back, however, if there is anyone on this ward who is not one of my patients, I will make them rue the day they set foot in here without my permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco made a sort of gulping noise. Harry just nodded. \u201cOK,\u201d he said very quietly.</p>\n<p>She turned on her heel and walked away, twitching the curtains closed behind her as she went.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhmygodohmygod,\u201d Draco said. He was out of the bed and wrapping the cloak around himself in seconds, his bare arse flashing at Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry began to laugh with the giddy relief of a disaster averted. \u201cIt\u2019s your fast getaway cloak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>,\u201d Draco said again, but he grinned. \u201cWhere the fuck are my pyjamas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping them as a souvenir,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanker.\u201d Draco said. \u201cI\u2019m getting out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, run off and leave me.\u201d He wished more than anything he could go with Draco, sneak back to the little room and spend the day there. \u201cI need to get better so I can come too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do. Hurry up and do it.\u201d Draco turned to go, but Harry grabbed at his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you come and visit me? Later?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd have to face Pomfrey again after what she just saw? Not a hope in hell.\u201d Draco smirked.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Ron came to visit shortly after lunch.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look cheerful,\u201d he said, tossing down a box of Honeydukes' Firework Furies and a copy of Quidditch Weekly. \u201cBrought you these. Watch out, they\u2019re seriously hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry eyes darted uncertainly from the magazine cover, showing four fit guys in Quidditch leathers, to Ron\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sweets,\u201d Ron explained. \u201cI mean the bloody sweets! They\u2019re those ones with the red-hot centres. I know you like spicy stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, thanks!\u201d Harry said, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look <em>really</em> cheerful,\u201d Ron said, suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to see you?\u201d Harry suggested.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, of course.\u201d Ron helped himself to a sweet from the box. \u201cSo, nothing to do with Malfoy roaming the castle early this morning? Barefoot, wearing only a cloak, seen sneaking out of the hospital wing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s face must have been a picture, because Ron snorted loudly. \u201cSpotted by Dean while out for an early Quidditch practice. You can\u2019t keep anything a secret around this place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron reached for another sweet and chewed thoughtfully. \u201cSo I take it you and Malfoy have been\u2026 you know?\u201d The look on Ron\u2019s face made it quite clear what he meant.</p>\n<p>Harry tried giving Ron a blank look, but it didn\u2019t work. \u201cErr\u2026\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYup. Quite a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Ron frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the perfect bloody set up for it, haven\u2019t you? Sharing a room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Relief washed through Harry that this was all Ron was bothered about. Ron sounded very hard done by as he explained, \u201cMe and Hermione have to take turns. With Millicent and the bloke she\u2019s seeing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t know she had a boyfriend.\u201d The thought of the abrasive Millicent climbing into bed with anyone was vaguely terrifying. Harry imagined she would probably put them in a headlock before she snogged them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Ron waved a hand. \u201cShe\u2019s been out with plenty of blokes.\u201d He gave a small cough, looking uncomfortable. \u201cSo, you know Hermione\u2019s quite friendly with some of the other girls now, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cShe seems really pleased about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ron leaned closer, as if confiding a secret of great importance. \u201cThey, like, discuss things.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201c<em>Bedroom</em> things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry let out a surprised laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know!\u201d Ron looked shocked. \u201cThe conversations they have. I\u2019ll tell you, anyone who says boys are the ones with dirty minds doesn\u2019t know a thing about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow.\u201d Harry was wondering whether he wanted details, and deciding probably not. \u201cGood for them, I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron shifted around in his chair. \u201cYup. I guess so. But\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron leaned in once more. \u201cIt gives her ideas.\u201d He raised his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Right. Well... that\u2019s, er, great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron looked anxious. \u201cIs it? I never know what she\u2019s going to suggest next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. I see.\u201d Harry must be an awful friend, because looking at Ron\u2019s worried face gave him a terrible desire to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI kept wondering where she was getting it all from. Well, she always was a fast learner,\u201d Ron said.</p>\n<p>Harry hid his smile by choosing a sweet and putting it into his mouth. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably calm down in a little while. You know what she\u2019s like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad thing. Some of it is really\u2026\u201d Ron broke off and cleared his throat. \u201cYeah. Anyway. Change of subject.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOK... How\u2019s Cornfoot?\u201d Harry wondered.</p>\n<p>Ron wrinkled his nose. \u201cOh, him. Same as ever. Although... he did actually laugh at one of my jokes the other day. That was a first. I thought to begin with he was having some sort of seizure, but no, apparently the one about the three centaurs finally wore down his resistance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry bit down to the glowing centre of his sweet, like a tiny flame on his tongue, and had to fan his mouth before he could go on. \u201cI also heard you got an O from Slughorn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Stephen\u2019s pretty good at Potions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe lets you copy his homework?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ron looked offended. \u201cHe just explained a couple of things to me. He\u2019s not a pain in the arse about it, not like some people. I\u2019ve been bloody bored, some evenings. You\u2019ve been busy all the time \u2013 well, I know why, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Ron, I honestly would have got around to telling you, only\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForget it, mate. But sometimes I didn\u2019t have anything better to do, and so I sort of got into the habit of sitting up there sometimes and working with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione stuck her head through the curtains around Harry\u2019s bed. \u201cWorking? I thought that was Ron Weasley\u2019s voice I heard, but I must have been mistaken.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron grabbed her around the waist and wrestled her into his lap. \u201cWatch it,\u201d he told her.</p>\n<p>Hermione was laughing and breathless as she pulled away and sat perched on the bed next to Harry. \u201cI can only stay a minute. How are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Harry told her. \u201cA <em>lot</em> better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s all happy and stuff,\u201d Ron told her.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stuff</em>?\u201d she repeated, mockingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you know me,\u201d Ron said. \u201cI\u2019m an emotionally constipated teaspoon or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI had a visitor. But I\u2019ll tell you some time when Pomfrey\u2019s not around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s eyes were full of curiosity, but she just smiled and patted his knee. \u201cOK. I\u2019ve got to run and do my Charms homework. I\u2019m getting so behind again, the exams are only a few months away, and according to my timetable, we should have covered all the major weather charms by now, as well as\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron gave Harry a meaningful look. \u201c<em>Some</em> things haven\u2019t changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione swept her thick hair back from her face, then assumed an innocent expression. \u201cOh, and Ron\u2026 if you\u2019re not busy this evening, I thought we could work on your Transfiguration project together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, Hermione, I told you, I don\u2019t care what mark I get on that. I\u2019m probably going to fail Transfiguration anyway, there\u2019s no point wasting more time on the bloody thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Ron,\u201d Hermione interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand. <em>Millicent</em> will be going out later. So we can work on the project <em>undisturbed</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron\u2019s face cleared and took on a look of nervous anticipation. \u201cOh. Right. Transfiguration. Yep.\u201d His eyes flicked to Harry, who struggled to keep a straight face.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Hermione\u2019s cheeks were a little pinker than they had been when she came in. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better get back to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron sat chatting for another hour, leafing through Harry\u2019s magazine and munching his way through the box of sweets, until Pomfrey came to evict him.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>\u201cSo.\u201d McGonagall looked over her spectacles at them. Harry had to remind himself he was no longer a first year, and that despite being summoned to her office the moment he was discharged from the hospital wing he was \u2013 probably \u2013 not likely to be expelled for this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am waiting for an explanation. Mr Potter, you go first. I\u2019ll get to you in a moment, Mr Malfoy.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I told you,\u201d Harry said, \u201cit was nothing much. An accident with a spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn accident that left you in Madam Pomfrey\u2019s care for nearly a week,\u201d she said tartly.</p>\n<p>Draco cleared his throat. He looked quite cool and composed, considering the circumstances. \u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I would get to you in a moment, Mr Malfoy,\u201d she said, rather sharply, and Draco pressed his lips together.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was casting something at Theodore Nott,\u201d Harry went on. \u201cI was\u2026 annoyed with him. But I don\u2019t know what it was I cast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the incantation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2026 wasn\u2019t one. I didn\u2019t mean to do it, but when I got angry with Nott, it sort of\u2026 sprang out of me, you know, the way it does when you do wandless magic. But I hadn\u2019t meant it to happen. And so I tried to take it back, the spell that is, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop there, Mr Potter. <em>The way it does when you do wandless magic</em>? What precisely do you mean by that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. I can do magic\u2026 without a wand. You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall\u2019s tone became sharper than ever. \u201cClearly, I do not know, or I wouldn\u2019t be asking. What <em>kind</em> of magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll kinds, really.\u201d Harry frowned. \u201cI mean, the simple stuff is easier, of course. Transfiguration is hard, I usually mess that up if I try. But basic defence stuff, everyday spells\u2026 things like <em>Accio</em> and <em>Lumos</em> and so on. I reckon I could have a go at duelling without a wand, if I needed to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco made a small sound, like something stifled in his throat, and McGonagall turned to him, her eyebrows raised. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Draco looked down at his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never thought it worth mentioning that you had this\u2026 <em>talent</em>?\u201d McGonagall asked Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cErr. I didn\u2019t think about it, really. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like you were there when I worked it out, were you? I was in the Forest of Dean trying not to get killed at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall\u2019s lips tightened at the disrespectful tone and Harry pressed on quickly with what he was saying. \u201cAnd then I didn\u2019t see the point of making a big deal about it when I got back to school, I just wanted to carry on as normal, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs normal? You call going around doing wandless magic without anyone\u2019s knowledge, <em>as normal</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s normal for me. It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s normal for anyone else, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry could hear his voice rising, but he couldn\u2019t seem to stop it. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t spend last year on the run from the most dangerous wizard of the times with their wand snapped in two, did they?\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall gave Harry a long, penetrating look, then stood up. She walked to the window and looked out. \u201cSo. Events of the last year aside. You can do wandless magic, a skill which the most powerful, experienced wizards treat with great caution, and use only after careful training and discipline, and you think it a good idea to use it to settle some petty disagreement with Mr Nott?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, that was a mistake.\u201d He felt anger flame inside him, even now. The thought of Nott, the casual, careless way he\u2019d touched Draco...</p>\n<p>McGonagall turned. \u201cYou have been using this power completely untrained, Potter. That is why mistakes happen. Of all the idiotic, foolhardy things to go and do\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t say anything. It was surprisingly humiliating to get a dressing down like this in front of Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had better explain all this from the beginning to Professor Flitwick. He can give you the correct training in wandless magic; a proper foundation so that you can use these powers safely, and only in appropriate circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry bit back a complaint. She was cross enough already without him making it worse. But really, when was he supposed to find the time for extra work?</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd for this incident, the reckless use of magic which led to serious injury to yourself, and could have endangered other students, I have no choice but to deduct House Points\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that go for anyone who has been using wandless magic?\u201d Draco asked.</p>\n<p>Both Harry and McGonagall turned to look at him. \u201cI beg your pardon, Mr Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry\u2019s not the only one. I\u2019ve been doing it, too. Wandless magic, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh Merlin.</em> It kind of seemed like Draco was trying to <em>stand by him</em>, and this was something Harry had never expected. Just the thought of it set warmth buzzing in his stomach \u2026 but Harry also had a feeling that the shit was really going to hit the fan now.</p>\n<p>McGonagall spluttered. \u201cWould someone care to tell me exactly what is going on this year?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt recklessness rise up within him. This whole thing was her fault, anyway. She\u2019d thrown them together with no warning, and apparently, this was the result. \u201cI taught Draco,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe can do <em>Lumos</em> easily. He\u2019s really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall walked back to the desk and leaned on it. \u201cYou\u2019ve been teaching your fellow students wandless magic,\u201d she said faintly. She looked up at Dumbledore\u2019s portrait as if for help, but the old headmaster was snoozing in his frame and she cast an exasperated look at him. \u201cHeaven help us all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not that hard,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of how hard it is!\u201d The cords of her neck stood out as she shook her head at them. \u201cYou eighth years are causing more trouble than all the rest of the school put together! Yesterday I found a group of girls in the library, Miss Granger among them I might add, who were clearly inebriated. In the library, of all places! And when asked what they thought they were doing, they all began <em>giggling</em> at me, and said it had been especially cold out by the lake that evening!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry risked a glance at Draco, who had ducked his head and appeared to be suppressing a smirk.</p>\n<p>McGonagall took off her glasses and rubbed at her temples, closing her eyes for a moment.</p>\n<p>Harry wet his lips. \u201cProfessor. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA sentence which begins in that way rarely ends well, Potter.\u201d She regarded him with piercing eyes. \u201cOh, go ahead, for goodness\u2019 sakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just think when you decide to chuck people together like you've done this year, you\u2019re going to get all kinds of weird stuff happening. You must have been expecting it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, heavens.\u201d McGonagall put her glasses back on and threw another look at the sleeping Dumbledore. \u201cThis is something of an experiment, I admit\u2026 but we certainly hoped there would be benefits to the situation which outweigh the disruption.\u201d She gave them a shrewd look. \u201cHave <em>you</em> seen any benefits?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt a blush rising up from his throat. \u201cErr,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked at the floor. \u201cWell,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s still quite early in the year.\u201d McGonagall didn\u2019t blink, but carried on watching him. \u201cYes, perhaps,\u201d he said eventually.</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t help asking. He\u2019d wanted to know since the start of term, and now was his chance. \u201cWhy did you choose to put <em>us</em> together. I mean, me and Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d McGonagall raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhat gave you the idea that <em>I</em> chose to do anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you? Then\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes went to the portrait, but Dumbledore had apparently woken and wandered off somewhere else, for the frame was empty.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the Sorting Hat,\u201d McGonagall said, and her lips twitched as she looked between the two of them and saw the surprise on their faces. \u201cWe consulted the Sorting Hat to decide who we should place together. It gave us some\u2026 interesting answers, I admit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked up at the hat, sitting upon its usual shelf, its point at a rakish angle. \u201cThe bloody hat? Seriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did that even work?\u201d Draco asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s some powerful magic in that hat, as you both know. It carries memories of all the students it has ever sorted. And then it used my personal knowledge of each of you, how you have grown and developed over the years, to decide\u2026\u201d She lifted a hand. \u201cWell. I\u2019m still not entirely sure <em>what</em> it thought it was deciding, but you know the results.\u201d McGonagall turned and regarded the hat with a cynical eye. \u201cI have questioned the wisdom of some of its choices. But at this stage I feel obliged to see it through.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That crafty old hat</em>! Harry always knew it had been pissed off with him for questioning its judgement, and now it appeared to have had the last laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, Potter.\u201d McGonagall peered over her glasses at him. \u201cI never knew the hat wanted to sort you into Slytherin House.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh, Merlin</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d Draco snapped out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, we had quite the chat about you when I gave it my memories.\u201d She gave them both a look. \u201cAbout all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Salazar\u2019s\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite enough, Mr Malfoy.\u201d McGonagall put her hands flat on the desk. \u201cWe seem to have strayed far from the matter in hand. House points to be taken from Gryffindor <em>and</em> Slytherin, too. Compulsory lessons on the safe use of wandless magic with Professor Flitwick. And I don\u2019t want to see either of you in my office again this term unless you have come to wish me a pleasant morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snorted, then hurriedly composed his face into something more appropriate. \u201cYes, Professor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may go.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>They emerged from her office slightly dazed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Slytherin</em> House?\u201d Draco asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat hat is a troublemaker,\u201d Harry said. \u201cListen. You didn\u2019t have to do that. Tell her you\u2019d been doing wandless magic as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, Potter, no need to get arsey with me. I\u2019ve already had one ticking off, thanks. If you\u2019d have kept quiet about teaching me she\u2019d be none the wiser, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not bothered about that.\u201d Harry stopped in the corridor. \u201cI mean, you put yourself in the firing line too. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed, then he lifted his chin. \u201cI just thought there was no point waiting for them to find out and get all shirty about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was\u2026 OK, don\u2019t laugh. It was sort of hot, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco <em>was</em> laughing, of course, the bastard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Like, she was furious and practically about to explode at me, and you were all, <em>Oh, by the way, I can do it too</em>.\u201d Harry had a stab at imitating Draco\u2019s haughty tones.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou find that hot?\u201d Draco looked surprised but certainly not displeased at the idea.</p>\n<p>Harry stared at Draco\u2019s mouth as he answered. \u201cYeah.\u201d He really did. \u201cAnd another thing.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThis is bloody ridiculous calling each other Potter and Malfoy when we\u2019ve had our hands down each other\u2019s trousers since term began.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your opinion, Potter.\u201d But Draco\u2019s eyes were glinting with satisfaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m calling you Draco from now on. Starting this minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m calling you Scarhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry tried to wrestle Draco up against the wall. There was a bit of a scuffle, during which Harry found out that Draco\u2019s shoes were quite pointy, and then Harry managed to get him pinned with one arm above his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, Potter. Stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean, <em>stop it, Harry</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it a rest.\u201d Draco rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay <em>Harry</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stubborn wanker.\u201d</p>\n<p>But he was hiding a smile, and Harry felt bubbles of elation swelling in his chest. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask something,\u201d Harry told him, a smirk pulling at his mouth. \u201cWas that true, what Theo Nott said, about you <em>falling</em> for me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up, <em>Harry</em>,\u201d Draco said, and mixed with the thrill of victory came that familiar feeling rising up inside Harry. The feeling that if he didn\u2019t get to kiss Draco, right now, that something in him was going to break apart with need, and he didn\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t just...</p>\n<p>Draco was staring at Harry\u2019s mouth. His gaze felt warm and heavy, and Harry held his breath as he tilted his head towards Draco\u2019s parted lips. He didn\u2019t stop until he reached Draco\u2019s mouth and, <em>yes</em>, this was what he\u2019d longed for, oh god, was it ever.</p>\n<p>There was something fearless about it, the way Draco gave his mouth up to Harry, and let him take what he wanted. And Harry wanted so much. He closed his eyes and let himself float in a hot haze of longing until he was dizzy from it. Draco\u2019s mouth was sweet from the spiced apple juice at breakfast. His lips were soft, and then hungry, and then demanding, and Harry forgot to wonder how many House points would be taken if they were caught like this outside the Headmistress\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>A door opened somewhere in the distance and the sound of feet hurrying on stone brought them back to reality. Draco pulled away. \u201cYou know we\u2019ve got double Potions,\u201d he said, his lips pink and well-kissed, and Harry could happily have <em>Incendioed</em> the entire Potions department if it meant he could go on kissing Draco a little longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s time,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s really <em>not</em>,\u201d Draco insisted, but he let Harry press him against the stone wall to kiss him one more time anyway, til his breath was coming faster into Harry\u2019s mouth, the hard length of his body making Harry\u2019s head swim. It only seemed like a second before Draco pushed him away again. They were late for Potions, but not by much.</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was cruel how slowly a day could go by when you were waiting for it to be over. Transfiguration. Charms. Then a free period, but Draco had Ancient Runes, and Harry had a ton of reading to catch up on anyway. Then Professor Sprout nabbed Harry in the corridor for a chat about how his Slug-Eating Lettuces were getting on in Greenhouse Three, and by the time he could get away, dinner was about to be served.</p>\n<p>Ron was noticeably cheerful and served himself a hearty helping of chicken pie.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking forward to working on your project?\u201d Harry teased him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron, grinning. \u201cActually...\" He looked around to make sure nobody was listening. \"Don\u2019t tell anyone, but first I\u2019m going out to the Quidditch pitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah? Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione\u2019s busy till seven, so I told Cornfoot I\u2019d help him out\u2026\u201d Ron lowered his voice till it was a whisper, \u201cWith his flying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right? Does he want to get on the team or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHim? Nah, he\u2019s bloody rubbish at it. Can\u2019t get more than a few feet off the ground before he wobbles like mad. And then he thinks he\u2019s going to fall, so\u2014\u201d Ron shook his head. \u201cHe makes excuses every time so no-one has to know he\u2019s worse than a first year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlimey. I hope you can help him.\u201d Harry frowned. \u201cBut\u2026 not being funny, Ron\u2026 why did he tell <em>you</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ron looked shifty. \u201cWell. There was a spider in my bed the other day, and\u2026\u201d He gulped. \u201cStephen had to deal with it. He\u2014 he could tell I don\u2019t like them much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry thought of Ron\u2019s likely reaction to the spider and suppressed a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt a bit, you know.\u201d Ron whispered again. \u201c<em>Embarrassed</em>. So he told me <em>he</em> was scared of flying. Well, can\u2019t have that, can we? I said I'd meet him out there after dinner. We should have time before Quidditch practice starts. And then\u2026 \u201c He waggled his eyebrows as he took another generous helping of pie. \u201cThe <em>project</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s appetite was no match for Ron\u2019s, and he let his attention be drawn to the Slytherin table, where Draco sat chatting with Goyle and taking sips of spiced apple juice. Harry watched the movement of his throat and the quick flick of Draco\u2019s tongue over his lips, knowing how those lips would taste and feel and, hell, he <em>wanted</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco looked up and met his eyes, and Harry felt an irresistible throb of heat at the base of his spine. Fuck, he wasn\u2019t sure if he could make it through this meal without going over there and\u2014 Draco smiled, slow and full of promise, and Harry could only guess what his own face was doing, because Ron was nudging him and Draco looked as if he were smothering a laugh. Merlin. Harry was going to have to sit here and finish his meal really slowly while he waited for his erection to go down, goddammit, and he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Draco knew perfectly well what effect he was having on Harry by just existing.</p>\n<p>Then Goyle got up, with Draco following, and as they walked past the Gryffindor table, Draco <em>smirked</em> at Harry, and that was it.</p>\n<p>Harry pushed away his half-eaten meal and got to his feet in a rush, then walked out as quickly as he could without running. He hurried through the quad and caught up with them near the kitchens.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook \u2013 Goyle \u2013 can I just butt in? I need Draco for a minute.\u201d Goyle looked mildly surprised, but Harry was already pulling Draco away and round the corner towards the Astronomy Tower and their room.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry panted. \u201cIs Goyle OK? You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No. He\u2019s fine. Off to play Gobstones with the Hufflepuffs.\u201d Draco looked bemused. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we go to our room?\u201d Harry stopped and searched his face. \u201cI\u2013 uh.\u201d Oh god, how did you say something like this? <em>I need you. Right now.</em></p>\n<p>But luckily Draco didn\u2019t need telling. \u201cOh. Nice idea.\u201d He took his bottom lip between his teeth as he looked at Harry. \u201cReally nice idea.\u201d His eyes were smoky and amused. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got Arithmancy \u2013 an extra study group for NEWT students.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>. \u201cWhen do you have to be there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn about five minutes.\u201d Draco put his head on one side and let his gaze travel over Harry\u2019s body. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and have a wank?\u201d he said, speaking low. \u201cGo up to our room and lie down on my bed and think about us together, yeah?\u201d His pupils were wide and inky, with just a ring of silver showing.</p>\n<p>Harry tried to strangle the moan rising up in his throat, but it came out anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, Harry. That would be fucking hot,\u201d Draco urged. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll come and join you later.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Uhhh</em>. Harry could do that. If he could make it up the stairs with this raging hard on, that is. He adjusted himself in his trousers, and Draco made a soft groaning sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Arithmancy thing lasts about an hour,\u201d Draco told him. \u201cI\u2019ll get away quicker if I can. Will you be in our room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Harry went to kiss Draco, but he ducked away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice try,\u201d he said. \u201cSee you later, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>Harry was waiting in the half-dark. He didn\u2019t want to wank \u2013 he wanted Draco\u2019s hands, not the consolation prize of his own. For a while he tried to study but he couldn\u2019t focus, and in the end he just gave up and lay on Draco\u2019s bed with his hands behind his head, desire thrumming through him in a steady pulse. He lay there, thinking, and remembering, and maybe dreaming a little. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had let himself want something that was just for him, and there seemed something awfully wrong about that.</p>\n<p>When he heard footsteps coming up the stairs, Harry\u2019s pulse leapt in time with the sound of Draco\u2019s shoes on the stone steps.</p>\n<p>Draco came inside in an elegant flurry, dumped his robes and satchel on the chair and then he stood, silhouetted against the light coming in the window where the Quidditch pitch was lit for a late practice. Just looking at him made Harry\u2019s throat tighten.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re on my bed,\u201d Draco said, and his voice sounded throaty. \u201cDid you\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI waited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. That's even better.\u201d The mattress dipped as Draco sat down. Harry felt oddly shy considering all the things they\u2019d done together, but this felt like something quite new. Draco\u2019s hand ran over his jaw and then cupped his face, his fingers brushing the hair at Harry\u2019s nape.</p>\n<p>\u201cI talked to Ron and Hermione about this. About <em>us</em>,\u201d Harry said, and Draco\u2019s eyes widened for a brief moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\u2026?\u201d Harry could feel tension rolling off him.</p>\n<p>Harry propped himself up on one arm. \u201cI told them I was happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy.\u201d Draco looked a bit stunned at the concept.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said. Draco was still too far away, so he sat up a bit more, till his breath whispered over Draco\u2019s lips. \u201cCan I?\u201d Harry wasn\u2019t sure why he was asking, but part of him just wanted to hear Draco tell him <em>yes</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed, and it sounded loud in the dark room. \u201cDo what you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but do <em>you</em> want me to?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes were half-closed. \u201cYeah. Yeah, do it. Do it, <em>Harry</em>.\"</p>\n<p>The angle was awkward, and Harry ended up kissing the corner of Draco\u2019s mouth. He straightened up a little, searching for the soft skin of Draco\u2019s lips, and the lush space between them, and when he found it, fuck, it was so good that he gave a low moan.</p>\n<p>Draco kept his hand on Harry\u2019s neck and pulled him closer, his tongue sliding in, slow and sensual. He tilted his head, making it deeper, making Harry feel <em>so much</em>\u2026 things he never thought he would feel. It was better than anything, better than flying, or casting his first Patronus, and they had the rest of the bloody evening to do this, and anything else they wanted, oh god, <em>yes</em>. Harry thought he could quite probably come, just from this, just from Draco\u2019s tongue stroking against his, and the clench of his hand in Harry\u2019s hair, and the soft stuttered breaths and sighs which passed between them.</p>\n<p>Harry had already taken his tie off, but now Draco reached for his own and worked the knot loose. It slithered onto the floor and then Draco began to work at the buttons of Harry\u2019s shirt. Harry shivered, but it was nothing to do with the cold, and everything to do with this new and strange feeling \u2013 the sensation of baring himself to Draco. Not just his body, but all of him. He was there for the taking. Draco snicked the last button free from its hole and then his hand was on Harry\u2019s stomach, smooth fingers grazing over his side as \u2013 oh, Merlin \u2013 Draco bent to press his mouth to Harry\u2019s collarbone, his tongue startlingly hot, his teeth a warning beneath.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s fingers shook as he reached for Draco\u2019s shirt. \u201cLet me\u2014 I want to see you,\u201d Harry said, and Draco cast <em>Lumos</em>, with his wand this time, and set it by the bed, the golden flicker casting soft light over all of Draco\u2019s angles. His pale skin glowed as Harry slowly undressed him, and Harry had never seen anything so compelling. He wanted to see all of it; to commit it to memory. The shift of Draco\u2019s muscles as Harry stroked over his ribs, the tightly crinkled knot of a nipple and the unexpected sound Draco made when Harry brushed a hand across it.</p>\n<p>Draco reached for Harry\u2019s belt, his expression so intent and hungry, and Harry lay back and let Draco strip his clothes away, leaving him naked and hard. The room was chillier than usual, and goosebumps raced over Harry until Draco reached for his wand. \u201c<em>Thermo</em>,\u201d he murmured, touching him here and there, and Harry groaned at the feeling of Draco\u2019s magic penetrating him down to the bone.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re good at that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe heating in the Manor is fucking atrocious,\u201d Draco said, layering warmth over their bare skin like cashmere, and then for a while there were no words, just murmured sounds of pleasure and the soft wet hush of kisses.</p>\n<p>Everything that was happening was incredible, just the feel of Draco\u2019s skin against his, hands clasped on muscle, lips ghosting over flesh, a tongue tracing a jut of bone. But Harry wanted more; he wanted in some ridiculous way to show Draco what this meant to him. He knew some of the things men did together. He\u2019d even seen pictures, in a magazine Ron found in Charlie\u2019s room when they were about fourteen, and the thought of Draco using Harry\u2019s body like that made him shiver all over, part-nerves, part-longing. But surely that would hurt\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it? And Harry might be no good at it; he was sure that would take practice, to be able to let someone do that to you, and he just wanted this to be right, to be good for both of them.</p>\n<p>Draco stopped suddenly and looked at his face and Harry realised he\u2019d been chewing his lip anxiously. \u201cWhat?\u201d Draco asked. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI.\u201d Harry took a deep breath. \u201cI thought you might want to\u2026 you know. Fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes widened for a second, but Harry pressed on. \u201cThe thing is, I\u2026 don\u2019t know how. And doesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stared at him, looking a bit dazed. When he spoke, his voice was throaty. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t you\u2013 don\u2019t you like what we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNo, I\u2013 I love it. I thought you might\u2026 I dunno. Be bored of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s mouth twitched, then. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d He gave a short laugh. \u201c<em>Bored</em>.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t resist kissing him, even as he was trying to answer. Draco closed his eyes and arched towards Harry, towards the hand tracing the ridges of his ribcage. \u201cThis is\u2013 uhh. Good. Pretty fucking good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry kissed him for a while longer, then Draco said, \u201cBut...\u201d He looked at Harry, and his voice took on a carefully casual tone. \u201cIf you wanted something different\u2026\u201d Draco went on.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said, without even thinking. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d He wished he had a Pensieve to capture it all: Draco\u2019s eyes full of heat, his well-kissed mouth, and the rangy strength of his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this thing someone told me about\u2026 ages ago.\u201d Draco said, his eyes flicking uncertainly across Harry\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you want to try it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d He suppressed the growl of <em>And who did you do it with</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2013 ah.\u201d Draco shrugged. \u201cI never actually...\u201d He looked at Harry, biting his lip. \u201cI just thought, if you wanted...\u201d</p>\n<p>If just the thought of it made Draco look like that, his eyes dark and hungry... \u201cYes,\u201d Harry said. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco kissed him some more, his hands in Harry\u2019s hair, tugging gently and making appreciative noises until Harry\u2019s insides were starting to feel like molten wax. When Draco pulled away, they were both breathing hard and Draco\u2019s pupils were as wide as Harry had ever seen them. Draco reached for his wand and pointed it at his hand, muttering a spell, and then a splash of something warm and wet hit Harry on the stomach, making him flinch.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d said Draco, not looking sorry at all, and then he smeared slippery wet heat all over Harry\u2019s cock, his hand working from the root to the tip and back again, and then down around his balls, his fingers stroking underneath, massaging and rolling and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Harry moaned. \u201cOh, fuck, that\u2019s good.\u201d Draco had learned all of Harry\u2019s weak spots, the bastard, and just how to work them so that Harry trembled at every touch. He knew the rhythm that would make Harry start to lose it, to let his head tip back, his mouth falling open with how good it felt...</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look so hot,\u201d Draco whispered, low and intense. \u201cSo fucking hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Harry said, feeling it start to rise up within him, powerful and shivery. \u201cI\u2019m going to come.\u201d It was far too soon. He snatched Draco\u2019s hand away and panted out some quick breaths until the feeling subsided and he dared let go. \u201cUgh.\u201d He pushed the sweaty hair off his forehead. \u201cLet me do that to you. What\u2019s the spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oleum caldus</em>,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry sat up to grab Draco\u2019s wand from the bedside table and started to cast before he saw Draco staring at his wand in Harry\u2019s hand, and realised what he\u2019d done. \u201cShit. Sorry.\u201d He offered Draco his wand back, but Draco just nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I shouldn\u2019t have just taken it,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI got so used to using it, you know and I think for a minute I thought it was mine\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can use it,\u201d Draco said, and then his mouth quirked at the corner. \u201cI kind of like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words made something quiver inside Harry\u2019s chest, but when he tried the spell, nothing happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cPush your wand into your hand a little bit at the end,\u201d said Draco, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it helps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave Draco a lopsided smile. \u201cWe need to learn this one wandlessly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Draco grinned. \u201cMake that a priority.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the second attempt, Harry felt his palm fill with a pool of oily warmth, far more than he\u2019d been expecting. Draco snorted as it dripped down Harry\u2019s arm and onto the bed. \u201cPlanning to wank off the whole school, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said, giving him a dark stare. \u201cJust you,\u201d and then he lifted his hand to Draco\u2019s cock and tilted it, letting the warm oil drizzle down over Draco\u2019s slit, dripping around the crown and coating his shaft.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco said, and when Harry\u2019s hand followed the oil, smoothing and stroking over every inch, \u201cFuck, oh, <em>fffuuuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry copied what Draco had done, reaching down for his balls and spreading the oil everywhere. God, even Draco\u2019s bollocks were beautiful. He didn\u2019t have a lot of hair there, and they were so neat and tight and, god, when Harry reached further and stroked along the wrinkled skin just behind them, Draco\u2019s mouth fell open in a wordless exhalation.</p>\n<p>Harry tried it again, wanting to watch Draco\u2019s face do that over and over, but Draco batted his hand away and grabbed the wand from the bed. He cast again, this time dripping the oil deliberately onto Harry\u2019s thighs, all over his balls and arse, and god, it would have been embarrassing how much Harry loved this, all the noises he was making, if it hadn\u2019t been so insanely hot. Draco smeared it all over, pushing Harry down on the bed with his knees apart so that Harry was completely exposed. Draco watched him the whole time with a fierce, hungry gaze that made desire twist in hot flurries through Harry\u2019s gut.</p>\n<p>Draco knelt up on the bed. He conjured one more palmful of oil and spread it over himself so his cock was glistening, every muscle taut and ready, his haughty face looking down at his own cock as he stroked it. Harry had never seen anything so shameless, so perfect, in all his life. Warm oil was getting everywhere, dripping from Harry\u2019s cock onto his stomach, trickling down into the cleft of Harry\u2019s arse, and he thought that if Draco tried to fuck him now, he\u2019d probably let him. But instead, Draco pushed Harry\u2019s legs together and moved until he was crouching over Harry on hands and knees.</p>\n<p>When he bent to kiss Harry, his lips were soft and searching. He tasted of salt and magic, and his hand in Harry\u2019s hair was damp with oil. \u201cOK?\u201d he whispered, and Harry didn\u2019t have a clue what he was agreeing to, but he nodded, and Draco slid his cock between Harry\u2019s closed thighs, all slick and warm and trembling.</p>\n<p>Some kind of noise came from Harry\u2019s lips, like a gasp or a sigh, or\u2014 <em>Oh, holy hell</em>. Draco started moving, slowly at first, holding himself up on his arms and watching Harry\u2019s face. He thrust against Harry\u2019s skin, the gap between his legs and \u2013 <em>uhh</em> \u2013 under his balls and, oh god, everything was so slippery and hot and fucking hell, that was good. Harry let out a long moan, and Draco stilled and asked again, \u201cOK?\u201d This time his voice cracked, and Harry had to take a breath before he could answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry sounded so hoarse. \u201cYeah, really, really OK.\u201d Draco\u2019s arms shook as he held himself above Harry. \u201cGo on,\u201d Harry said, and he thought he might go mad if Draco didn\u2019t do it again, now. \"Go <i>on</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco bit his lip and closed his eyes for a moment, and then started to move again, this time pushing in further, past Harry\u2019s thighs. He didn\u2019t try to get inside Harry, to do any of the things Harry had seen in Charlie\u2019s magazine which had looked so brutal and worrying. Instead his cock dragged silkily against Harry\u2019s balls and then against his cleft, and it felt so incredibly good and so bloody dirty at the same time. So good, in fact, that when Draco pulled back, Harry pressed his thighs tightly together, to keep him there.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Draco said. \u201cOh, oh god <em>yes</em>,\u201d and Harry did it again, squeezing his thighs together around Draco\u2019s cock and feeling the way it jerked against him. Draco looked as if he\u2019d been Obliviated, blinking down at Harry with his mouth open. Then, slowly, his face intent, he began to find a rhythm, watching Harry to see his reactions. There were plenty of those. Harry felt as if he were unravelling, every thrust making his nerve endings spark with delight, the feel of Draco\u2019s cock trapped between his thighs making him want to growl his approval. As for the steady, teasing pressure on the underside of his bollocks and his arse... sweet Merlin. Everywhere Draco touched set off feverish ripples of heat.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s breath hitched, his stomach taut and the lean muscles of his thighs driving him forwards as he fucked into the tight space between Harry\u2019s legs. He looked so full of grace and power and Harry felt another spike of need in his belly. He pulled Draco to him so that their bodies were flush against one another, chest to stomach to hip and ahh, yes, Draco still kept moving, Harry\u2019s cock now pressed between them, hard and aching, slippery with oil and pre-come and sweat.</p>\n<p>Harry threaded his fingers through Draco\u2019s hair, kissing his throat, his jaw, his lips, everywhere that the wandlight flickered on his skin. Draco\u2019s face glowed with an insatiable look, and then his mouth was crushing Harry\u2019s, the weight of his body so satisfying, so right. The honeyed glide and drag of Draco\u2019s prick between his thighs was like nothing Harry had ever felt before and part of what had him gasping and begging was how impossibly intimate it was.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes\u2013 more, fuck, <em>more</em>,\u201d he moaned. Draco slotted their bodies together so that Harry could thrust up against Draco\u2019s stomach, his cock rubbing against the smooth skin there \u2013 once, twice, three times \u2013 and then the heat roaring through Harry\u2019s body spilled over into a delirious, flooding bliss. He arched up against Draco, his cock pulsing powerfully between them, and then Draco gave a low cry and started to judder against Harry. \u201cHoly\u2026 fucking\u2026 oh, god, Harry,\u201d Draco gasped, and Harry felt him come over Harry\u2019s legs, smearing over his balls and into the cleft of his arse, and his own cock jerked again with one last heavenly throb.</p>\n<p>Draco slumped on top of him, his body surprisingly heavy when at rest, his chest heaving. Harry felt his own racing heartbeat start to slow, and a rapturous kind of ease took over. He wound his hand into the fine silk of Draco\u2019s hair and let his body sink into a warm, lush place where nothing mattered but the feel of Draco\u2019s skin against his.</p>\n<p>When Harry felt like opening his eyes again, he found that Draco\u2019s were already open and he was watching Harry, his eyes the softest and smokiest Harry had ever seen them. He was hiding nothing, and in that moment, Harry felt that he could do anything, take on the whole fucking world if he had to, just so long as Draco would look at him like that afterwards. Neither of them spoke for a minute, then Draco looked at Harry from beneath lowered lids and said, \u201cDo you know your knees are really fucking bony?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned, shifting on the bed to deliberately grind his knees against Draco\u2019s legs. \u201cYup. Do you know your ribs are like a xylophone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a xylophone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuggle thing. You hit it with a stick thing and it makes a noise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas about that.\u201d Draco rolled off to lie at his side. \u201cGod, this bed is a wreck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry peered down at himself. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m ready to be wrapped in foil and baked in an oven.\"</p>\n<p>Draco grinned lazily and waved a hand. \u201cClean everything up for us, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do you and me, but your bed is trashed. You\u2019re going to sleep in a puddle of grease while I lounge around on lovely crisp sheets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco narrowed his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah? Why not?\u201d Harry whispered threateningly, but his hand reached to play with the soft hair at Draco\u2019s nape.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I want to go to sleep now, on clean sheets \u2013 if I can find a comfortable position without your bony knees prodding me \u2013 then wake up in the night and do that to you all over again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, Draco.\u201d Harry\u2019s stomach lurched with arousal again. <em>Again</em>, for god\u2019s sake. Was there no bloody end to it?</p>\n<p>\u201cOr you do it to me.\u201d Draco\u2019s voice was soft and filthy in his ear. \u201cOr how about you lie on your front, and I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough. Merlin. Time to swap beds.\u201d Harry felt laughter rising up in his throat. \u201cSo kind of them to give us two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMcGonagall thought of everything. She and that fucking hat. And listen.\u201d Draco leaned over Harry, pinning him down with one arm. \u201cAbout you and Slytherin. I haven\u2019t forgotten. What the hell was that about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we\u2019re in the other bed. It can be your goodnight story. Go on, get moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to be the first to go over there and get into a freezing cold bed...\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pushed him, hard, and Draco yelped as he rolled over the greasy sheets and almost fell out. He grabbed at Harry, hard enough to hurt, and pulled himself back into the middle.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou arse. I nearly ended up on the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a tragedy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Draco wrestled with Harry until Harry\u2019s head and shoulders were off the bed and the rest of him was in danger of joining them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Harry protested, fighting back, but Draco was strong and sinewy and Harry couldn\u2019t pull free. Draco was laughing, his face lit with devilry, and as he pinned Harry\u2019s arm and made to heave him right over the edge, Harry grabbed hold of him around the middle and tried to flip him, with the result that they both tumbled off and landed with a massive bump that shook the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco was half-laughing, half-groaning. \u201cMy bloody elbow. You are the worst roommate in the entire world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSod your elbow, your poxy trunk is digging right into my arse. Do you sharpen the corners of it specially or something?\u201d Harry tried to get up, but Draco was half on top of him and as Harry wriggled, Draco pinned him again, quick and determined, and got Harry\u2019s hands above his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Harry said mockingly. \u201cYou got me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I did,\u201d Draco breathed, his eyes flicking approvingly over Harry\u2019s body lying beneath him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever shall I do?\u201d Harry asked with as much sarcasm as he could muster.</p>\n<p>\u201cLie there and take it, Potter,\u201d Draco said, and he leaned in to kiss him, and then it was really quite a long while before they made it to Harry\u2019s bed at all. \u00a0</p>\n<p>*^*^*</p>\n<p>It was dusk again. Harry would have to admit he loved this as much as the sex: the quiet, still intimacy of it, sitting together in the darkness with their knees touching, the light gleaming on Draco\u2019s skin, and the soft murmur of <em>Lumos, Lumos</em> in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do it easily now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but still not wordlessly.\u201d Those little furrows that Harry loved appeared between Draco\u2019s eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it.\u201d Harry cupped his hand around Draco\u2019s glowing fingers, letting the light play over his own skin. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell McGonagall.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed softly. \u201cNo. It\u2019s our little secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry cast with only a thought, and light glimmered at his fingers too.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo disobedient of you.\u201d Draco touched his own fingertips to Harry\u2019s and watched as the light intensified.</p>\n<p>Merlin, he looked so <em>open</em>, watching with childlike focus as their fingers laced together, casting shadows of light and dark that danced over their skin. His usual guarded expression was completely gone, and Harry felt a great tug in his chest that left him feeling breathless.</p>\n<p>Harry moved his hands so that they were wrapped around Draco\u2019s, cradling the light as if it was precious. Or maybe he was trying to hide it from the world. As if it was the last spark of warmth and hope anywhere and they had to protect it. He pressed their hands together, fingers tucked in so that the visible light dwindled to a mere glimmer.</p>\n<p>Then Harry loosed his hands and the light sprang free again, vivid and astonishing. Draco\u2019s face lit with pleasure and Harry couldn\u2019t resist the tug, not any more. He pressed his lips to Draco\u2019s mouth and Draco made the sound of surprise he often made when Harry did that, as if he would never quite get used to it, and then he kissed Harry back.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s tongue searched for the seam of Draco\u2019s lips, coaxing them to open, before Draco\u2019s <em>Lumos</em> faltered and then went out altogether.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your fault for distracting me,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said, and let his own light go out. He loved it like this, in the half-dark, too, Draco\u2019s lips only a vague shape in the darkness. It coloured everything with just a hint of danger, from the spice of Draco\u2019s cologne hanging in the air, to the feel of his magic whispering over Harry\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you were sorry, you wouldn\u2019t\u2013 <em>uhh</em>\u2013 do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Harry said, casting without words again and bringing his hand up to Draco\u2019s hair, the light making it shine like strands of gold that gleamed from within. There was no way to hide how Draco made him feel; he couldn't resist. He couldn't remember why he had ever tried.</p>\n<p>Draco kissed him again, his head tilted, his fingers splaying over Harry\u2019s throat and jaw. \u201c<em>Lumos</em>,\u201d he murmured against Harry\u2019s lips, and there was light, and it was beautiful.</p>"
