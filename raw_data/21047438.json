  "notes": "<p>This was only supposed to be like a 2000 word oneshot not a chaptered fic. I don't know what happened.</p>\n<p>Just a little indulgent fic of Wild animals loving Zuko and everyone around him trying and failing not to find it cute. I have no explanation for this. Blame it on MuffinLance.</p>\n<p>( This takes place after Southern Raiders and before Ember Island Players)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Poor Sokka. A wart on your throatal flap will really turn you against frogs. He stood no chance against Zuko and Froggy\u2019s wholesomeness. Don't ask me how Froggy managed to track Zuko down. Just chalk it up to that love an animal has for it's human.</p>\n<p>Holidays mean freetime. Yay! </p>\n<p>Just a note. Ham Ghao is the name of that really bitchy Sun Warrior who wanted Aang and Zuko to fail.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And then Zuko found a Phoenix. He tried to name it Sunny but Iroh stepped in. Aang once again drowned in jealousy. Sokka could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>-Insert sad sappy AN here-</p>\n<p>Hey everyone.</p>\n<p>I know I've been gone for a while. Things have been pretty terrible on my end. Mental health issues and a few Hospital visits have pretty much taken up my time in the past few months, but even that can't compare to the biggest hit I took. </p>\n<p>I lost my Mom in April to Cancer.</p>\n<p>Even today it still doesn't feel real. I still can't look at any of her pictures without crying. Everything reminds me of her, reminds me that she is gone and I didnt even get a chance to say goodbye. But through the sadness and tears, funnily enough the reviews I would get, the knowledge that people enjoyed what I put out, it was one of the things that helped me. It meant so much to me to see my silly insignifiant little stories could make people happy during this time that is so hard for everyone and I found my will to write again and when I started I couldn\u2019t stop. ^^</p>\n<p>I might sound like a ridiculous sap for saying so , but thank you guys, thank you so much for helping me, for kicking me back into gear. Even if all you were doing was just enjoying a cracky fluffy fic.</p>\n<p>-End Sad sappy AN -</p>\n<p>Now back to the regularly scheduled fluffy humor.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Mango, at Jee : Who lets a cub run out into a rockslide and get injured!? You fail at parenting! And what\u2019s with that Scar on his face? Let me find out any of you put your hands on my cub-</p>\n<p>Jee: General Iroh, why is she growling at me?<br>-------<br>I really couldn\u2019t end this without including Sokka.</p>\n<p>Jee (and the crew) love Zuko and care about his well being. I don't take constructive criticism.</p>\n<p>That's the end of it. I become quite fond of this universe. I might make it a series and write some oneshots here and there. Especially since you guys have given me some good ideas about assassin stopping turtleducks.</p>",
  "text": "<p>Sokka comes back to the waking world rather slowly, his body protesting the entire way. It had been a hard week with running from the Fire Nation and fighting a war . So it\u2019s a bit of a surprise when Sokka finds himself blearily blinking up at the night sky in blank confusion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The slight crackling of the dying fire and the warmth of his bedroll do a phenomenal job of leading Sokka back into dreamland . He snuggles deeper into his bedroll, flexing his toes deep into the fluffy and slimy warmth\u2026..\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait. Slimy?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRibbit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka shoots up. It takes awhile for his eyes to catch up to his sleep-fogged brain, but when it does the first thing he notices is a pair of large glowing yellow eyes staring back at him from under the front of his bedroll.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His proceeding manly howl is loud enough to wake the dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> (\u201cIt was a girly shriek.\u201d Toph will argue later, when she is more awake and thus able to properly insult Sokka. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cIt was a manly howl,Toph\u201d\u00a0 A sulking Sokka would reply. \u201cI thought being blind made your ears bett- Ahhhh.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cNow that was girly shriek.\u201d Sokka would keep his mouth shut after that because Tui and La , did Toph hit hard! ) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As it stands, his manly howl is more than enough to wake the entire camp, who in less than five second are up, mobilized, armed and ready to confront the danger attacking their trusted comrade.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Sokka would take the time to be impressed( and a bit touched) if he wasn\u2019t still hopping from foot to foot and patting frantically at his arms ,trying to rid his clothes of the slimy icky Froggy residue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka.\u201d Katara\u2019s water whip gleams in the, her eyes sharp and dangerous and way too alert for someone who was just woken up in the middle of the night.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a frog in my bedroll!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The immediate silence that follows his statement is judgmental and frankly, quite rude.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA frog?\u201d\u00a0 Katara says blankly. Beside her, a wild haired, rumpled Toph stares in his direction incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c You woke us up and nearly blew out my eardrums... over a frog?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's a big Frog!\u201d Sokka snaps, indignation making his voice shrill. Could they not see how distraught he was?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Toph stares at him for a moment, then looks towards the boulder she\u2019s levitating. She turns back to Sokka and there\u2019s an oddly\u2026 contemplative expression on her face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToph?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would leave too much of a mess.\u201d Is what Sokka thinks he hears( He\u2019s obviously mistaken because Toph would never crush him with a rock...right?)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As it stands, Toph lets her boulder drop with an accusing thud, and stomps back to her bedroll.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that the adrenaline of their rather abrupt wake up call has worn off, the rest of the Gaang , confirming that there really wasn\u2019t any real danger( Physically, Sokka\u2019s emotional well-being was definitely in danger at the moment) were all dropping their weapons and shifting into relaxed stances.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if there\u2019s nothing else.\u201d Aang says, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. His eyes shift over to Sokka and Sokka can tell that it\u2019s only Aang\u2019s innate kindness that is currently keeping the monk from laying into him. \u201cLet's all go back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s greeted with a chorus of sleepy agreements as Suki, Zuko and Katara start to hobble back to their bedrolls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka desperately resists calling out to them. His pride battles with his need to avoid all things amphibian in nature, but he had already lost enough face, waking everyone for a frog in his bedroll, he wouldn\u2019t stoop to actually asking them to get the frog out for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No matter how big and warty it was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just as Sokka was steeling himself up to confront the giant monster frog, a hand came to rest on his shoulder. He looks to see Zuko staring down at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStand back,\u201d he says gruffly, \u201cI\u2019ll get the frog out of your bedroll.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think I need you to get the frog out of my bedroll.\u201d Sokka sniffs, trying to portray an image of manly bravado. From the look on Zuko\u2019s face,however, something tells him he\u2019s not doing a very good job.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't know. I just got the impression that you don't like frogs very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u2018I DON\u2019T!\u2019 </em> is what Sokka desperately wants to say, but he notices that Aang and Katara are watching the exchange curiously. He takes special notice of the glint in Katara\u2019s eyes. He knows that glint. That\u2019s her \u2018I'm-going-to-use-this-embarrassing-thing-against-you-when-you least-expect-it\u2019 glint. Sokka would not give her the satisfaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, but I think I got it covered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zuko moves to head back over to his own bedroll, but a deep, loud, threatening\u00a0 Ribbit has Sokka making a wild lunge for Zuko\u2019s arm, firmly rooting him in place. There\u2019s a long awkward silence, broken only by Katara\u2019s barely muffled giggles.<br><br></p>\n<p>\u201cUm, It\u2019s a really big frog.\u201d Sokka says weakly. The look Zuko gives him is one of\u00a0 almost patronizing kindness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka valiantly ignores his sister and stands off to the side as Zuko carefully approaches the occupied bedroll. He watches with a certain degree of vindication as Zuko\u2019s eyes widen as he pulls open the top of Sokka\u2019s bedroll.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gigantic isn\u2019t it? The biggest frog you've ever seen?\u201d He says smugly before turning to Aang and Katara, \u201cSee? Even Zuko\u2019s shocked. Imagine that. A gigantic monster frog, in your bedroll. That\u2019s what I woke up to so I would appreciate a little bit of sympathy for-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Zuko\u2019s shocked exclamation abruptly cuts off the rest of Sokka\u2019s bid for sympathy. As one he, Aang and Katara turn to where Zuko is staring at the inside of Sokka\u2019s bedroll, his eyes shining in delight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Zuko?\u201d Sokka calls. Zuko ignores him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, little guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s soft tone is out of place for someone currently looking at a giant, monster frog. In fact, it\u2019s more akin to someone looking at their favorite pet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko shuffles back a bit from Sokka\u2019s bedroll and holds his hands out, palms up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He beacons softly, \u201cCome on out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a happy ribbit from within the confines of Sokka\u2019s bedroll (really how does one discern emotion from a frog? This is what happens when Sokka doesn\u2019t get enough sleep) and suddenly something slimy and gigantic and warty jumps out into Zuko\u2019s open palms. Sokka shudders in utmost revulsion at the wet sound the action produces. That was in his bedroll!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oogie!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a pretty big badgerfrog.\u201c Sokka hears Aang whisper, and he doesn't even take the time to bask in his validation, too preoccupied by the strange sight unfolding before him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can't believe it!\u201d Neither can Sokka. Zuko is actually cooing at a\u00a0 Frog like it was some cute Polar Bear pup instead of a slimy disgusting, hideous monster frog. The Fire Nation was weird.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know this Frog?\u201d Katara asks, as she comes over to stand next to Zuko, Aang in tow. Zuko nods absently, his eyes crinkling in soft fondness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe kept me company at my first\u00a0 campsite, the one I stayed at before I joined you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean the one way back near the Western Air temple? \u201c Aang says, his eyes bulging. \u201cThat was miles away, not even factoring in flying on Appa! He followed you all the way from there!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure it\u2019s the same badgerfrog?\u201d Katara asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c Yeah,\u201d Zuku says and runs a finger down the Frog\u2019s warty back, \u201cSee, I recognize the markings on his back. I can't believe he followed me all the way here.\u201d Zuko raises the Frog to his face, \u201cHow did you find me, Froggy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFroggy?\u201d Aang asks with utter delight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s his name.\u201d Zuko says with an entirely straight face, as if there was nothing out of the ordinary about an angry jerky angsty Banished Prince naming a frog Froggy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katara makes a strange sound at that,\u00a0 almost crossed between a hiccup and giggle. Sokka chooses not to comment on it . Mostly because of the situation at hand. There are so many things he could say about this situation. Such a wealth of material, an endless well of mockery, but Sokka is running off little sleep and post-frog-in-bedroll adrenaline so the best he can come up with is,</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFroggy is a stupid name for a Frog.\u201d Zuko\u2019s shoulders visibly slump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka!\u201d Katara says giving Sokka her best disappointed glare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d Sokka waves his arms wildly in Zuko\u2019s direction. \u201cHe\u2019s just basically taking what it is and putting a \u2018Y\u2019\u2019 at the end of it! It lacks creativity, individualism, intrigue!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The stare Katara levels at him reeks of \u2018I'm-going-to-use-an-embarrassing-thing-against-you.\u2019</p>\n<p>Sokka shrivels before the might of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHawky.\u201d Is all she says. It effectively takes all the wind out of Sokka\u2019s\u00a0 sails. Leave it to Katara to\u00a0 expose Sokka\u2019s blatant hypocrisy in the art of animal naming rather than blindly taking his side and backing him up like a good sister should!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Froggy is a perfectly wonderful name for a Frog.\u201d Aang says with a smile. Sokka doesn\u2019t recall Aang giving that reassurance. \u201cAnd he must really like you if he followed you all the way from the Western Air Temple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s face lights up and he draws Froggy the BadgerFrog closer to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you stop cuddling that thing!\u201d Sokka cries because he just can\u2019t take it anymore. Zuko has had the frog pressed against his chest for a solid minute and Sokka skin crawls at the slight slimy residue he can see shining on Zuko\u2019s clothes..</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm not cuddling him!\u201d Zuko snaps. He brings the Frog closer to his chest, ironically cuddling it even harder. \u201cCome on Froggy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka does like the way Zuko says that. \u201c What do you mean \u2018Come on, Froggy\u2019?\u2019 I hope you mean \u2018 Come on Froggy,\u2019 as in\u00a0 \u2018Come on Froggy, let me toss you out into the wilderness where you belong. \u2018</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, why would that be what I meant?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re obviously going to take him far away from the camp and set\u00a0 him loose so he doesn\u2019t rudely interrupt my precious sleep again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko looks scandalized at the very thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not setting Froggy loose.\u201d he says, his brows drawn into a frown. \u201cEspecially after all the trouble he went through to find me. He\u2019s staying with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka knew he was gonna say. He knew it, he had seen it coming when he\u2019d started fawning over the frog. And that's why Sokka has a\u00a0 response ready to go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo Zuko. You absolutely are not going to\u00a0 keep a slimy ugly frog that doesn\u2019t respect personal boundaries at this campsite! Nu-uh, not happening!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s face shifts\u00a0 into an expression of deep offense. \u201cFroggy isn\u2019t ugly! Don\u2019t say that! You\u2019ll hurt his feelings!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka couldn\u2019t believe he was having this conversation.

I\u2019m not going to abandon him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka is forcibly reminded of being in a similar position. Except instead of Zuko, it\u2019s Katara. And instead of a badgerfrog it\u2019s a polar dog bear pup, or a zebra seal, or a penguin, or a tigershark, or an airbender -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, losing focus. Zuko was being too damn stubborn about this frog. He needed outside support.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara back me up! We don't need a slimy frog hopping around,do we? Think of the warts!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what this is about\u201d Katara murmurs with a slight shake of her head. She turns to Zuko and places a comforting hand on his shoulder. \u201cDon't mind Sokka, Zuko.\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Aang pipes in. He\u2019s looking at Zuko and the Frog with those sappy eyes he wears when he\u2019s looking at something cute. Which was ridiculous because cute, frog and Zuko did not belong in the same sentence. \u201cSokka just has a thing about Frogs...and warts.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, <em> that </em>sounded strangely accusational. Sokka wouldn\u2019t stand for it. \u201cA WART ON MY THROATAL FLAP AANG!\u201d Aang sighs and Katara rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Tui\u2019s sake- there was nothing there Sokka!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI KNOW MY THROATAL FLAP KATARA!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko looks between Sokka and Katara in abject confusion, before eventually turning to Aang when no explanation is offered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aang merely shrugs and waves his hand in the universal gesture of \u2018you-don\u2019t-want-to-know\u2019. Thankfully Zuko takes his dismissal in stride and drops it. Instead, he takes a step closer to Sokka, holding up the Frog a little higher. Sokka is treated to\u00a0 a brief look at large yellow eyes before Zuko is suddenly a good few feet away from him and there\u2019s a tree separating them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Aang says, clear amazement coloring his tone. \u201c I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you move that fast, Sokka.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep that thing away from me!!\u201d Sokka yells from behind the safety of his tree.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFroggy wont hurt you Sokka.\u201d Zuko says in a tone that was meant to be comforting. It was not.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a good frog. He\u2019s nice and cuddly and he\u2019s a really good listener.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of those things did not sound quite right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFrogs can't be cuddly, Zuko.\u201d Sokka says, \u201dAnd how do you know he's a good listener?\u201d He adds as an afterthought because honestly all things considered, a cuddly frog is a lot stranger than a frog that's a good listener.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was my sounding board back at the campsite.\u201d Zuko says, as if that was a natural thing to do. \u201cHe actually helped me practice my introductory Speech. Y\u2019know, the one I used when I asked to join you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That gets everyone\u2019s attention. Katara turns to Zuko slowly, her eyes practically sparkling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou practiced that speech...on a frog?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her voice cracks at the end. Sokka, shockingly enough, completely understands. Because as much as he wants to deny it, the image of Zuko actually practicing an introductory speech to use on the Gaang, on a frog no less, is so unbelievably dorky it somehow transcends hilarity and settles firmly into adorable territory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka feels the intense need to insult Zuko, just to realign the universe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWell, if he\u2019s your speech advisor you should\u00a0 think about firing him cause your introductory speech sucked.\u201d Sokka says with a haughty sniff. Zuko sheepishly rubs the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFroggy actually thought it was bad too. He hopped away after I tested it on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huh? Well, Froggy may be ugly and disgusting but at least he wasn\u2019t dumb, Zuko\u2019s speech skill were truly terrible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so the frog at least has good taste, but I still object to him staying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can't make that decision by yourself!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but Aang can. Aang, tell Zuko he can't keep that monster frog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFroggy went through so much to find me Aang. Tell Sokka he deserves to stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both turn to a wide eyed Aang, who looks surprised at his sudden promotion to mediator. He looks at Sokka, then back at the frog, then at Zuko then back at Sokka then finally back to the frog. Sokka knows he\u2019s already lost even before Aang\u2019s eyes soften in the way they normally do before he\u2019s about to cave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Betrayal! Aang has been turned by the enemy! Sokka should have known this would happen when they let Zuko into the group. To actually use Aang's love of animals to get his way.Katara was right this whole time. Zuko was an evil mastermind sent to infiltrate the Gaang and tear them apart!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAaaaangggg,\u201d Sokka says in his best big brother voice. But it is nothing in the wake of Zuko\u2019s rather impressive set of\u00a0 puppy dog eyes. It wasn\u2019t far. Zuko was a big brother too. Big brothers were not to have puppy dog eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little froggy Sokka.\u201d Aang says and just like that the matter is officially closed. Aang has ruled in Zuko\u2019s favor. The frog is staying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka tries to be angry. Truly he does, but Zuko\u2019s doing something unfamiliar\u00a0 with his face that\u2019s currently making it impossible for Sokka to focus on being mad. Something that pulls at his cheeks and makes his eyes light up and ....</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, he\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s an unfair thing to do when Sokka is trying to be mad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome aboard Froggy.\u201d Zuko says. He brings Froggy the BadgerFrog up to his face and presses it against his cheek .\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, now <em> that </em> was just overkill. Sokka couldn\u2019t separate that, no matter how Oogie it was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well and truly defeated, Sokka ignores the beaming Aang and cooing Katara and slinks away to his bedroll to lick at his wounds. \u201cJust keep that abomination away from me!\u201d he calls over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sokka. I won't let Froggy anywhere near your throatal flap.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko says this with such genuine earnesty, Sokka can\u2019t even be mad when Aang and Katara burst into snickers.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The servant\u2019s\u00a0 fervent and fearful whispers are what compels Zuko to stop. The day was young and warm, Agni high and proud in the sky. Zuko had thought a nice stroll was warranted. He had no pressing issues to attend to, so why not take a break? Beside, Papaya, one of the adult turtleducks, was due to birth a clutch soon and Zuko really wanted to check up on her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yet, it was only halfway through his walk that he noticed Dai and Mei, two of the servants that tended the gardens, bundled together in a corner, fear coloring their faces. Zuko doesn\u2019t so much as stop to think as he changes his course and quickly makes his way over to them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, Mei, Dai?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko barely resists sighing when they jump in that familiar way that\u00a0 his staff does whenever he directly addresses them. He really does sigh when, in unison, they sink into bows so low their noses nearly brush the ground. Really, they\u2019d talked about this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Your highness. \u201c Mei says, \u201cForgive our idleness. How may we assist you?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Good Morning, I\u2019m not in need of any assistance. I just, um noticed that you both looked a little distressed. Are you okay? Is there something I can help with ?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Nothing you need to worry about your highness.\u201d Mei said. \u201cIt\u2019s just there\u2019s a small disturbance in the garden.\u201d Now that caught Zuko\u2019s attention.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c A disturbance in the gardens?\u201d His turtleducks were in the gardens.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t handle , your Highness.\u201c Dai rushes to pacify, \u201cIt was just an unusual creature and it took us by surprise.\u201d That made him even more alarmed</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Unusual how?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c It was small and slippery. It moved really fast, so we didn\u2019t get a good look but from the slashes we saw along the trail it left behind, it must have some pretty impressive claws. We managed to track it to a nearby bush but when we got close enough it let out the most ferocious growl. We sent Aki to fetch a guard- um your Highness?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko walked towards the garden. A guard. There was something dangerous enough in his gardens to warrant a guard.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko doesn\u2019t pause as Mei and Dai catch up to him, trailing behind him nervously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Um, your highness,\u201d Dai says, \u201cMay I ask where you are going?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I\u2019m going to confront this creature.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mei and Dai look about ready to pass out at the mere notion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Your highness, no! I promise we have it under control. You need not concern yourself with these trivial matters!I!\u201d Zuko does not break his stride, waving off Mei\u2019s concern with a flick of his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI do when my staff is in danger. Beside my turtleducks are in there. They could be in trouble.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I honestly fear less for the turtleducks and more for whatever is foolish enough to attack the little menaces- ack!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Zuko stops at the Garden\u2019s entrance and turns back to them. Dai is rubbing his arm, his eye fixed firmly on the wall. Mei smiles sweetly at him. She quickly hides her clenched fist behind her back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing your Highness.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shrugging, Zuko silently gestures for them to stay still, cutting off their immediate protests with a sharp glance. He leaves them at the entrance and silently creeps into the garden.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first thing Zuko notices is that his usually tranquil garden was not very tranquil. In fact, it sounded like it was in the midst of absolute pandemonium, if only due to the loud angry squawking. Zuko cautiously makes his way over to the pond, his senses on high alert. The pond is completely empty, every turtleduck having forgone their domain to cluster around a nearby tree. If Zuko strains his ears, he can just barely make out a low chattering growl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhoa guys! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zuko is absolutely shocked. His turtleducks have never acted like this before. They look half ready to start climbing the tree. Half of the squawking abruptly stops and suddenly Zuko is swarmed by a fluffy wave of feathers as the younger turtleducks happily crowd around his feet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Normally, this would effectively take away all of Zuko\u2019s attention but he can\u2019t help but notice that the adult turtleducks are still squawking at the tree. It would seem they had chased something up there. Taking extra care not to step on any chicks, Zuko walks over to the tree. He immediately notes that the trunk is covered in claw marks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Everyone settle down.\u201d He soothes as the squawking from the adults grows more frantic at his appearance. He gently tugs his robe from\u00a0 the beak of Lilac, one of the mother turtleducks, as she attempts to tug him away. Now that he\u2019s closer, he can definitely hear the low growling. However, the nearer he comes the more the ferocity of that growl eases. By the time he\u2019s at the base of the tree the growling has morphed into a low trill.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Looking up, Zuko only has about a second to register a pair of golden eyes before something is barreling straight for his chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko barely has time to even summon his fire before a small,hard, pointy weight rams into his stomach. He goes down hard in a flurry of limbs, robes, and panicked yelps.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He hears the outraged squeaks from his turtleduck and the alarmed gasps of Mei and Dai but Zuko only has eyes for the small huddle of purring scales clinging to the front of his robes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh no.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The news of the Fire Lords\u2019 abrupt departure is a hot button topic in the palace by sundown.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mei and Dai remain tight-lipped even as Prince Iroh quietly slips in as his nephew's representative with the reasoning that his nephew simply had an urgent matter to attend to.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Fire Lord swore us to secrecy.\u201d Is all Mei and Dai say as they frequently share glances filled with giddy wonder and delight. The other palace servants are near ready to resort to bribery by the end of the day.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Fire Lord's eventual return coincides with a surprise visit from the Avatar and company. Mei and Dai\u2019s air of secrecy takes on a smug knowing edge, like there\u2019s an inside joke that only they are a part of.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>------</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aang blinks as he steps into Zuko\u2019s study. The sight before him remains. He blinks again, rubs a fist over his eyes. The spots that enter his vision lets him know that he indeed is not hallucinating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That fact does not bring him comfort.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Zuko, um, w-w-whatcha got there buddy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA tea cup.\u201d Zuko is all smiles mixed with an aura of serene tranquility.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If it was anyone else, that might\u2019ve been an attempt to dodge the question or a sarcastic quip but this is Zuko so Aang dismisses it as a typical literal Zuko answer, because he was indeed holding a teacup, and tries again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI um, actually meant that,\u201d Aang points a finger just beyond Zuko\u00a0 to where a tiny, red dragon is currently tearing into a tiny tea cake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Zuko\u2019s tone is adoring and yet perfectly casual, as if a baby Dragon tearing into a teacake was an everyday occurance, \u201c This is Druk. He\u2019s my new Dragon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There were a lot of gaps between</span>\n<em>\n<span> \u2018this is Druk\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018he\u2019s my new dragon\u2019 </span>\n</em>\n<span>that Aang desperately needed filled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Like,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Where do you find a baby dragon?\u2019</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018How did you get the baby dragon here?\u2019</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018What is it with you and finding things that have been missing for centuries?\u2019</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And most importantly,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Can I hold it?\u2019</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Granted, that last one may not be the most pressing question but it was still pretty important.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aang takes a minute to think of the best approach for this situation because while visiting Zuko and discovering that he had a new pet was now a shockingly familiar experience, visiting him to see that he now had a baby dragon was very different from visiting him and seeing he had added yet another pond to the royal garden to hold his growing collection of turtle ducks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>However, just as Aang settles on the </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Where and how</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019, Sokka choses that very moment to make an appearance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Zuko, I heard you just got back buddy. How was your little vacat -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Whatever else Sokka was about to say was completely cut off the second he laid eyes on Zuko or rather Zuko\u2019s newest friend. His easy going smile slowly slides off his face, replaced by a look of abject horror\u00a0 as he processes what he\u2019s seeing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko... is that a dragon?\u201d Sokka doesn't wait for Zuko to answer him, \u201cZuko that\u2019s a Dragon. That\u2019s a dragon, Zuko. Why do you have a dragon Zuko? Zuko, where did you get a Dragon?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSokka,\u201d Aang soothes, because Sokka's face is doing that twitchy thing, \u201ccalm down!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sokka turns to Aang, his eyes shining\u00a0 with such a crazed intensity that Aang actually takes a hasty step back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAang, that\u2019s a dragon! Aang, why does Zuko have a dragon!?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c His name is Druk.\u201d Zuko says helpfully. Unfortunately, it does not\u00a0 help in the slightest. If anything this sets Sokka off even\u00a0 more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c You let him name it?!\u201d He shouts at Aang who puffs up in indignation.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I didn\u2019t let him do anything! He had already named it before I even knew he had it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere did he even get a dragon to name?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to figure out!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They both turn to Zuko, who stares back at them with an expression of blank puzzlement as if they are the ones who are being weird. Aang approaches Zuko carefully.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Zuko, you think you can tell us a little more about your new friend?\u201d Zuko immediately perks up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c He likes tea cakes. \u201c Zuko says brightly, before his eyes take on a worried glint as he surveys the dragon happily licking the crumbs off the table, \u201cBut I\u2019m worried about him having so many sweets. This is the 2nd one. I don\u2019t want them to upset his stomach. I\u2019ll have to contact Chief Ito again just to make sure I\u2019m keeping up with his diet -\u201c </span>\n<span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm,\u201d Aang interjects gently, keeping a wary eye on Sokka, \u201c I was thinking more along the lines of where you got him from, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, my gardens. The poor thing was chased up a tree by my turtleducks. I still need to figure out what caused them to be so aggressive. I\u2019ve never seen them act\u00a0 that way. They nearly swarmed me trying to get at him. I was barely able to get him out of the gardens \u00a0 -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sokka pinches the bridge of his nose. He looks about a step away from tearing his hair out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko, forget about your crazy, possessive army of psycho turtleducks!. Where. did. The. Dragon. Come. From!\u201d Zuko frowns at Sokka in reproach.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy turtleducks aren't crazy or possessive.\u201d Aang wasn\u2019t sure about that. He had marks on his ankles that said otherwise. \u201cAnd his name is not Dragon, it\u2019s Druk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sokka throws his hands in the air. \u201cDruk then! Where did you get Druk!?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I told you, I just found him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The silence that follows is broken by the loud smacking of Sokka\u2019s palm meeting his forehead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aang can sympathize. He does not believe that for a second. Coming from personal experience, downplay was the language of Zuko. After all, Aang wouldn\u2019t feel that Zuko was leaving out a significant portion of the story if </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018 I just found him.\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> wasnt the exact same answer he had whenever anyone inquired about how he managed to track down the Avatar.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luckily, Sokka is of the same mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did not just </span>\n<em>\n<span>find</span>\n</em>\n<span> him, Zuko.\u201d Zuko opens his mouth to argue but Sokka swiftly cuts him off. \u201c No! I refuse. I refuse to believe you just randomly found a Dragon in your gardens. You don\u2019t just find something that hasn't existed for over a century.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut is that\u00a0 not exactly how we all meet?\u201d Aang just can\u2019t help but point out. The look Sokka gives him is the very essence of dryness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPresent company excluded.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko considers him for a moment, a contemplative look on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c You know you might be right Sokka. I didn\u2019t just find him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFinally, you\u2019re starting to talk sense-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c He found me.\u201d He shoots Druk a fond smile, to which the dragon responds with a proud trill.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sokka\u2019s eye twitches and Aang decides at that point that it\u2019s best for him to do his Avatar thing and start meditating.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe need a little more background Zuko. Do you think you can start from the beginning?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it all started when I went for a walk \u2026.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chief Ito was a complete loss. He knows he should say something, knows that the stretching silence was unsettling the young man before him, but cannot believe what was happening.He knows his fellow Sun warriors feel the same is their slack-jawed expression are any indication. Ham Ghao looked particularly upset. Ito has never quite seen so many veins on his forehead at once.The only one that doesn\u2019t seem affected by the thick tension was the actual cause of it. The Young Master currently dozing in the Fire Lord\u2019s arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because the Fire Lord, despite all evidence to the contrary and Ham Ghao\u2019s ...insistent accusation, absolutely did not steal the egg. What\u00a0 thief would return something that they stole? That and the Fire Lord was too honest on top of being a horrible liar. Chief Ito knew the second the boy had come flying into the inner sanctum with a tiny dragon clinging to his front,his face a mask of distress and babbling about turtleducks and gardens, that he had absolutely no idea the honor that had been bestowed upon him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A spirit bond.That was the only thing that could have compelled the Young Master to not only travel to the Fire Lord\u2019s palace but to recognize him on sight.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first Dragon born in over a century had formed a Spirit bond with the Fire Lord. The Fire Lord he\u2019d never seen. The Fire Lord that probably only held his egg for 10 seconds tops. The Fire Lord he\u2019d travelled across an entire nation for.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ito frowns.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>30 years.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>For 30 years, Ito had looked after\u00a0 that precious golden egg. Protected it from all that would see it harmed and cared for it as if it was an actual dragonling. Not once had the egg so much\u00a0 warmed under his touch. But the Fire Lord holds it for a couple of seconds and the young Master sees fit to not only hatch but to make an entire cross-country journey.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chief Ito is not a child and thus is not prone to fits of petty jealousy, but he wouldn\u2019t lie and say that he wasn\u2019t annoyed and a bit bitter by this turn of events.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If only slightly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d probably be a little more so if the Fire Lord and the Young Dragon didn\u2019t make such a cute picture.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFire Lord Zuko?\u201d Ito calls. The boy jumps at the sound of his voice and subconsciously tightens his arm around the bundle in his arms. The young master makes a happy sound,\u00a0 snuggles up deeper into his robes, and butts its tiny head against his chin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The young Master is tiny and very affectionate and already firmly attached to the Fire Lord. Ito is an old man, he has a pretty good hold on his emotions, but it is becoming harder and harder by the second not to break into a smile at the admittedly adorable sight of the Young Master trying to bury himself into Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s robe.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which makes what he\u2019s about to say a little easier to get out.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt would appear that the Young Master has created a Spirit bond with you.\u201d\u00a0 At the boys blank stare, Ito elaborates. \u201cIt has claimed you as a companion, so to speak. In the days of old, dragons would mark humans that they were fond of through Spirit bonds. That is what the young master did to you and why he was able to find you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut I had never even seen him before. How was he able to mark me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I think it may have happened after you picked up his egg on your last visit here.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut it was ages ago, and\u00a0 I didn't even hold it for that long! How could he have bonded with me that quick!?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI cannot be sure.\u201d Is all Ito can manage\u00a0 because he honestly has no damn clue himself. This was clearly the work of something far beyond the realm of his understanding. A dormant Dragon egg hatching at a simple touch could only be the work of the Spirits. There was no other explanation. No matter how badly Ito would like to keep the little master, he was not fool enough to interfere in the work of Spirits.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBe that as it may, there is no interfering with a Spirit bond. As such the Young Master is now in your care. It is not easy to raise a dragon, so I will need a few days to catch you up on proper care as well as-\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, \u201c Ito starts as Ham Ghao's heated\u00a0 voice cuts across his words. His Second is glaring at The Fire Lord with barely contained venom. \u201cI do not accept handing a Dragon over to a member of Sozin\u2019s line!\u201d The Fire Lord tense at that but thankfully remains silent, even as his eyes narrow into a heated glare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Young Master has chosen the Fire Lord as his Companion, Ham Ghao. \u201c Ito says, willing the boy to hold his tongue. \u201cWe must respect his decision.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c With all due respect, Chief Ito, the Young Master is an infant. He knows not the crimes of the line of Sozin. I propose that we care for the young Master just to ensure he actually makes it past infancy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s shoulders slump at that and Chief Ito feels a stab of annoyance at his second\u2019s intolerant attitude. \u201cHam Ghao, you are out of line. You dishonor the Master\u2019s\u00a0 wisdom and insult the Fire Lord\u2019s integrity with your accusations. \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ham Ghao does not back down. If anything he pushes harder. \u201cOur job is to protect the Dragons and keep their existence a secret. Do you really believe that the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fire Lord</span>\n</em>\n<span>-\u201d He spits the word.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u201cWould be able to contain himself\u00a0 from revealing the secret of the Masters? Do you think he\u2019d forgo the glory?\u201d</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don't care about glory!\u201d Fire Lord Zuko snaps, outraged.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve kept the secret of the Masters and I intend to continue to do so!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd how will you do that if you have a Dragon in your care,hmm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBy lying of course!\u201d Ito notes with some amusement that Ham Ghao is at a loss at how to counter that. Unfortunately, he recovers quick enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c If you were supposed to have that Dragon, there would have been a sign, some sort of indication from the Masters -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His words were cut off by a tiny growl. Ham Ghao\u2019s eyes widen and he takes a hasty step back as the tiny Dragon lunges at him. With his fangs flashing and tail on edge he\u2019s a far cry from the mewling docile dragon of just a few seconds ago. In fact, he looked downright terrifying. Before Ito can even think to intervene a louder, more menacing growl shakes the ground. As one, the Fire Lord and the assembled Sun warriors turn to the cave of the Masters. Shaw\u2019s head peeks out of her cave, her eyes focused squarely on the Fire Lord Zuko. Everyone falls to their knees and\u00a0 holds their breath, unsure of what to do at one of their Masters\u2019 sudden appearance. Shaw slowly slides her gaze over the assortment of\u00a0 Sun warriors before landing on a frozen Zuko. She holds his gaze for a few seconds and then tilts her head back, unleashing\u00a0 a roar that produces a shower of Dragon fire.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a sign of approval if Ito\u2019s ever seen one. He looks over to Ham Ghao. The man's face is pale, his expression twisted into a mixture of a grimace and a scowl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Ito says faintly as Shaw retreats back into her cave.\u00a0 \u201cI do believe that that\u2019s all there is to say on the matter. The young Master has made his choice and one of the Masters has given their approval.\u201d\u00a0 Ito pins Ham Ghao with a pointed stare, \u201c Unless of course you still believe there is a mistake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ham Ghao\u2019s eye twitches, his face twisting into an expression that made him look slightly constipated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo Chief.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood. Then it's settled. The young Master passes over into Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s guardianship.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Young Master lets out a happy chirp at that. With not another glance their way, he turns back to the shock still Fire Lord and leaps at his chest. Fire lord Zuko\u2019s arms move to cradle him automatically.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just as well. Even without Master Ran\u2019s approval, Ito had seen the iron grip the young master had on his new Guardian\u2019s robes and the equally possessive(albeit tender) hold the Fire Lord had on the Dragon. Nothing short of the full force of every Sun warrior present would be able to pry the tiny dragonling from the Fire Lord\u2019s\u00a0 arms. Ito wouldn\u2019t lie and say he wasn\u2019t apprehensive about the young Master staying with the Fire Lord or the existence of a Dragon being exposed to the world but he trusts the master\u2019s judgement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSoo, he stays with me?\u201d Fire Lord Zuko asks, finally regaining his voice. Ham Ghao\u2019s face twists even more at the hopeful question, but he holds his tongue. The Young Master and\u00a0 Master Shaw have spoken and he wouldn\u2019t dare go against them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Yes, young one. The young Master has chosen you as\u00a0 his guardian.\u201d Ito\u2019s barely bites back a smile when the FireLord eyes literally begin to sparkle. \u201cMay you find veneration in your new companion, your highness and through actions may you usher in the new age of Dragons.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I\u2019ll take care of him, I swear it.\u201d The boy breathes and there\u2019s such fierce conviction in his words,that Ito doesn't doubt for a second that the Fire Lord will be the ideal companion for the Young Master.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I think I\u2019ll name him Scales.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Or not.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Scales.\u201d Ito hears Ham Ghao whisper behind him. There\u2019s a hint of genuine terror in his voice. Ito can empathize.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. No. No no no.\u00a0 Ito had been very forgiving when it came to\u00a0 the line of Sozin\u2019s crimes against the Dragons but every man had a limit. THERE HAD TO BE A LINE!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour Highness, perhaps a more illustrious name is appropriate, all things considered.\u201d Ito says with a touch of desperation because he will not be known as the man who let the Fire Lord name the first dragon born in centuries \u2018Scales\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Oh,\u201d The Fire Lord asks. He strokes the Dragonling\u2019s back, a contemplative look on his face. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d Ito say a tad too quickly. \u201cMay I suggest Druk? It means Thunder Dragon. It\u2019s a proud mighty name. I think it would suit the Young Master quite\u00a0 well.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Please take the name.\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> Ito thinks as Fire Lord Zuko lapses into silence. \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Please, Sweet Agni take the name.\u2019\u2019\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Eh, \u201c Their Fire Lord says after a moment of quiet deliberation. \u201dHe looks more like a Scales to me but if it honors his heritage then Druk it is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Thank Agni.\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> Ito thinks as the newly named\u00a0 Druk trills in delight under Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s tender affections.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And thus Chief Ito\u00a0 would go down in history as the only person to save one of Zuko\u2019s pets from his horrible naming skills.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s an honor he\u2019d unknowingly wear with pride.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sokka has his head in his hands by the time Zuko has finished with his epic tale. Aang can vaguely hear him muttering. He thinks he catches the phrase\u00a0 </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Freaky Animal magnet spirit powers\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018conspiracy against his sanity.\u2019 and \u2018of course it would be a Dragon\u2019 </span>\n</em>\n<span>somewhere mixed in there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, Aang says,\u201d You mean to tell me that the golden glowy thing in the temple was a dragon egg the whole time?!\u201d At Zuko\u2019s nod, Aang crosses his arms, fuming as he thinks back to the pretty golden orb that he had warned Zuko not to touch. If he hadn\u2019t been so careful he could've had his very own dragon. Dangit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Aang internally fumes Zuko\u2019s boldness, Sokka finally composes himself enough to speak in coherent sentences.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is all your fault, Aang.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aang abruptly snaps out of his funk to stare at Sokka in indignation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow is it my fault?!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sokka scowls at Aang, his hands coming to rest on his hips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>It\u2019s just a little Froggy, Sokka</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Sokka says in an eerily accurate impression of Aang\u2019s voice. \u201cRemember when you said that? Remember when he found that monster frog at\u00a0 the Campsite and you said that?You enabled him and now look at where we are!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sokka waves his hands\u00a0 to where Zuko is happily feeding Druk another tea cake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA Dragon Aang. An actual Dragon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis name is Druk.\u201d Aang says before Zuko can. He sees Zuko nod approvingly out the corner of his eye. Yes. Cookie points. He could practically feel that tiny dragony weight in his arms.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd how was I supposed to know a frog would escalate to a dragon!?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThese things always escalate Aang,\u201d Sokka says darkly, his eyes taking on a haunted edge \u201cOne day it\u2019s a baby penguin separated from its herd and then BAM you\u2019re trying desperately not to die as you herd a full grown tiger shark back into the sea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Those scenarios sounded a little too specific. Aang makes a mental note to pull Katara aside later and get the details.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to tell you that you can't keep the Dra-Druk.\u201d Sokka quickly corrects as Zuko opens his mouth, \u201cClearly this has to be the work of some kind of freaky, spirit magic. I mean, one time is a coincidence but twice is a trend. I\u2019m not getting in the way of freaky spirit magic. That being said, I hope you know that taking care of a Dragon is a huge responsibility, young man, and you need to be sure you\u2019re up to it. \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aang wasn\u2019t so sure Sokka was talking to Zuko during that last part. He really needed to grill those details from Katara.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko for the most part, seemed to be taking Sokka very seriously indeed, if his very serious expression was anything to go by.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m more than up to it. I told Chief Ito that I was not leaving until I knew all there was to know about Dragon Care. That\u2019s why I was gone for so long, so he could teach me. He even gave me some old scrolls to read through.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood. Also, I would like the coordinates to the Sun Warrior temple.\u201d</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n</span>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI need to send the Chief a strongly worded letter about Dragon Egg watching.\u201d\u00a0 Sokka pauses to consider something, \u201cAnd a thank you note, you know, for stopping you from naming that poor little guy Scales.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Scales!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a stupid name Zuko. Scales is a stupid name for a dragon. You can name a frog Froggy but\u00a0 you can't name a Dragon something lame like Scales! He would\u2019ve been a laughingstock.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAvatar Roku named his dragon Fang,\u201d Aang says, once again showing off his irrational need to defend Zuko\u2019s terrible naming skills. \u201cand he was pretty intimidating.\u201d Sokka stares at the monk in disbelief.</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAvatar Roku named his dragon Fang?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad name either.\u201d Zuko says with a thoughtful look. Sokka shakes his head in despair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a family thing. It\u2019s got to be a family thing.\u201d</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere you guys are! Zuko, what is this we\u2019re hearing about a tri - IS THAT A DRAGON!?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis name is Druk.\u201d Aang, Sokka and Zuko say in perfect unison.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katara can only blink in helpless confusion.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It doesn\u2019t take long for news of Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s newest acquisition to spread across the Fire Nation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The general populace could not believe it. To think that a dragon, something believed to be dead for over a century, would suddenly turn up in the Garden of their venerable Fire Lord and claim him as its owner. It was something straight out of a spirit tale. A long dead legend revived! A perilous journey taken to find their one true companions. Was it not the might of Agni\u2019s Chosen? To call forth legend from the dead? It was a sign from Agni himself. A sign that their Fire Lord and their Nation was indeed blessed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The tale spreads past the Capital. The story becomes a favored folktale practically overnight. Takao of the colonies eagerly watches his fortune grow with each rendition of </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018The Sacred journey.\u2019 </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0An original ballad composed of the heart-wrenching journey of the last dragon seeking his treasured Fire Lord.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c I tell ya Lee,the Fire Lord is a magnet for legends straight outta spirit tales .\u201d Takeo chirps to his friend as they stroll through the market. He doesn\u2019t notice a nearby figure in blue immediately tense up. \u201cHe found the Avatar. He found a Dragon. Who knows? Maybe the next thing he\u2019ll find will be a phoenix.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Sokka, no!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There is a slight commotion to his left and then Takao is on the ground, an angry blue blur looming over him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done! You\u2019ve doomed us all. If you say things like that it might just come true! Take it back! Take it back!\u201d The bard is too shocked to even speak as he\u2019s violently shaken back and forth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Sokka, let him go!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c Not until he takes it back! I\u2019m putting my foot down Katara. He will NOT find a phoenix. I will not allow it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It takes the effort of Lee and two girls;one that bears a striking resemblance to the crazed lunatic, and one that looks to be blind; to get the boy off of Takao. He\u2019s helped to feet by a hand covered in the tattoos of an airbending Master. Takao can only stand there stiffly as the Avatar himself bows low in apology.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s been a long week.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And without another word he joins the two girls in dragging away their companion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seemed like the Fire Lord didn\u2019t actually have to be present. Just his name alone could call forth legends.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Takao starts composing his next ballad that very night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He titles it </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cThe Fire Lord and the Phoenix\u201d</span>\n</em>\n<span> and puts it aside for later.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just in case.</span>\n</p>\n<p>Jee is sure that later, when he has time to process what is currently happening , he would still never quite understand how things had progressed to this point.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Not too close. Not too close.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cAHHH! IT ALMOST TOOK MY ARM OFF!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cStop yelling!

Why had it not been a simple scouting mission?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ground rumbles threateningly. All conversation ceases as the Sabre Tooth Moose Lion rises from its\u00a0 tense crouch, kicking up dust and pebbles as it stomps angrily It\u2019s beady black eyes glare at the assembled group menacingly. It bears its teeth, a low snarl rising deep from its throat\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jin drops the slab of\u00a0 meat and he, Haku and the handful of other crewmates huddled a bit further back, scramble to put some space between them and the Moose Lion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of them trip. Some of them trip over each other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee barely resists the urge to bury his face into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Agni, they were making complete fools of themselves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In hindsight, he really couldn\u2019t blame them, neither the crew nor Jee were adequately prepared to deal with such an\u2026.. unprecedented situation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the world works in mysterious ways when you follow a banished Prince chasing after a spirit tale.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Satisfied with the distance, the great hulking beast lowers back into her defensive crouch, careful not to crush the unconscious Prince she so fiercely guarded. The very same Prince they\u2019d been trying to retrieve for the last hour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And throughout it all, the Prince slept on, completely unaware of his precarious predicament.</p>\n<p><br>That in itself was more worrying. It had been a good while since the Prince was knocked out and the cut on his head was still bleeding sluggishly. They needed to retrieve him so they could treat his head injury before it got worse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee turns to the huddled group of trembling\u00a0 sailors who\u2019d taken solace behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing!? Get back in there and retrieve your Prince!\u201d<br><br>\u201cSir!\u201d Jin squeaks, \u201c That thing almost took my arm off!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't get angry, Jee. Be comforting. It improves morale.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo it didn't,\u201d Jee snaps,\u00a0 \u201c That was a warning nip at best. If it really wanted your arm, you wouldn\u2019t have it anymore!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Considering the fact that Jin\u2019s face goes 4 shades paler, Jee would hazard that that fact wasn\u2019t very comforting at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coward. His men were a bunch of cowards.General Iroh could never know what happened here. They\u2019d never live down the shame.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop sniveling boy! So what if it takes your arm. Are you not a loyal citizen of the Fire Nation! It is your duty, your privilege, to risk life and limb for the Royal Family!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s scary!\u201d Haku wails. The man looks as if he would actually start crying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Indeed, the beast\u00a0 was scary\u00a0 with her razor sharp tusks and colossal paws. She had yet to grow to her full size, but that just made her even more lethal. There was nothing more dangerous than an adolescent Sabre Tooth Moose Lion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, Jee wasn\u2019t moved, mainly because there was indeed reason to fear for their lives, but it was not because of the Beast before them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can guarantee you that there are far scarier things than a temperamental Moose Lion, mainly an elderly General that was once the Dragon of the West.\u201d Jee feels a very grim satisfaction at the way the men pale. Good. They should be afraid. Jee sure as hell was. \u201c Do any of you fancy explaining to General Iroh why we allowed his nephew to be ensnared by\u00a0 a vicious beast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sir.\u201d the men say, suddenly looking a lot more\u00a0 motivated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was good. If they could just get the Prince they could probably salvage this situation. Explain away his injury as something else and make sure that General Iroh never knew what happened-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that is indeed good to hear, for I assure you that no explanation you could give me would be satisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee doesn\u2019t scream, because he\u2019s better than that. His men, unfortunately, are not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGENERAL IROH!?\u201d Jee wants to cry, did they have to sound so pathetically shrill?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>General Iroh\u2019s answering smile is all teeth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, General Iroh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Angi preserve him, Jee would hazard he\u2019d just lost a good ten years off his life at the General's tone alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeneral Iroh,\u201d Jee was not shaking, he was not! \u201c Sir, I thought you were going to wait on the ship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>General Iroh regards him coolly and Jee loses an additional 5 years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c I was. But then I heard the sounds of a rockslide and I grew worried. It is indeed fortunate that I\u00a0 chose to track you down.\u201d General Iroh surveys the scene with a solemn gaze. \u201cYes, a good thing indeed, because not only did you not send someone to inform me, immediately, that my nephew was in danger, but from what I just heard it also sounded like I would have never known about this incident otherwise. I would hope that you weren\u2019t intending to lie to me about what happened here, Lt. Jee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cO-o-o-o-of course not sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTruly? Well in that case, would you care to tell me why my bloody and unconscious nephew is being held hostage by a Sabre Tooth Moose Lion or\u00a0 am I just to infer that your guardianship abilities are so horrendous you could allow such an unbelievable oversight to occur?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sweet Agni, Jee was going to die. He was going to die either by shame or Dragonfire. And he\u2019d deserve it.\u00a0 He was a failure, a disgrace\u2026.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, would be an appropriate time to tell me, Lieutenant.\u201d Jee can't hold back a flinch at that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell sir, let me assure you that the Prince currently isn\u2019t in any danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>General Iroh raises a brow at that, and Jee sees his life flash before his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m curious to know what you define as <b> <em>danger</em> </b>, Lt. Jee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI understand your scepticism but, it\u2019s really not what you think, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? What is it then?\u201d Jee swallows. He throws a quick look at his useless crew before turning back to the General\u2019s feet because looking him in the eye was currently impossible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this-\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">000000000000000000000</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry up!\u201d Prince Zuko snapped for what was surely the 100th time. Jee barely resists snapping back at the little brat, the tremulous task of not slipping down the narrow mountain path doing much to hold his tongue. The mountain rumbles ominously with each step they take, fine tremors shaking the small foundation beneath their feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee bits back a curse as he loses his footing once again. He barely managed to snag hold of a tree branch, saving himself from a rather nasty tumble. Behind him, he hears a few of the men in their tiny search party grumble mutinously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can't blame them. The Prince had been absolutely unbearable( well, more so than usual)\u00a0 since he\u2019d gotten a tip at the last\u00a0 outpost that could lead him to a spot the Avatar was said to have frequented. He\u2019d damn broken the engine in his rush to get to the tiny Island, and had hopped off the boat before they had the chance to even properly dock, yelling for the entire crew to comb the Island.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had only been the timely interference of General Iroh that had\u00a0 halted the Princes\u2019 frenzied\u00a0 charge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA search party seems more prudent.\u201d The General had said, because he was old and wise and should really be leading them instead. \u201cLess of a waste of time and resources, wouldn\u2019t you agree, my nephew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And thus the Prince had assembled a small group of men, which included Jee because the Spirits hated him, to map out a course for more in-depth exploration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which landed them on this damn mountain covered in rocks and misery.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another tremor shakes the mountain, dislodging a few rocks. Jee hears Haku\u00a0 yelp behind him, followed by the sound of rocks crumbling and decides enough is enough. They need to get off this damn mountain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Prince, perhaps we should -\u201d But the Prince shushes him with a harsh hand wave.<br><br></p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d He hissed and Jee\u2019s hackles raised. Disrespectful little-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, before Jee could finish puffing up in anger, Prince Zuko pointed down towards an adjacent path.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook.\u201d Jee begrudgingly followed his hand and felt his stomach drop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Further down the path, was a raging\u00a0 Sabre Tooth Moose Lion. Jee\u2019s brain temporarily forgets how to work as he takes in the beast\u2019s giant frame and razor sharp tusks gleaming in the sunlight. There are a few things that the Earth Kingdom has to offer that can truly frighten him, and one of those things were Sabre Tooth Moose Lions. Extremely Dangerous and highly temperamental, Jee had heard horror stories about the beasts from some of his friends from the colonies. He would sooner take on a battalion of Earth Kingdom soldiers than wrestle with a Sabre Tooth Moose Lion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His palms were already heating when he saw that the beast had not noticed them. In fact, Jee would doubt it would notice anything , what with it\u2019s attention being solely focused on the giant boulder pinning its paw to ground. Jee watches as the beast struggles against the weight , it\u2019s struggles growing more and more frantic as it slams it body against the cliffside..\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least he knew what the source of the tremors were.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should double back.Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait! \u201c Jee turned back\u00a0 and saw that the Prince was staring at him in outraged disbelief. \u201cWe can't leave it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWha- yes we can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s trapped!\u201d<br><br></p>\n<p>Jee failed to see why the Prince phrased that as if it was a bad thing. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good for us then. Less chance of getting maimed. Now, let's double back and get as far away from that beast as\u00a0 physically possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving it there.\u201d Prince Zuko growled and the only thing that stops Jee from strangling the boy is the fact that assaulting Royalty is a crime worthy of imprisonment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Zuko,\u201d Jee said slowly, calmly, \u201c that is not a badgerfox kit with its paw stuck in a snare trap. It is a vicious monster that can snap your spine with a single click of its jaws. You ARE NOT going to get near it. We ARE going to double back, and you WILL return to the ship UNMAIMED.\u201d<br><br>Prince Zuko\u2019s looks like he\u2019s rearing up for an epic tantrum, one Jee is ready to smack down, but any retort he can give is cut off as the Moose Lion lets out a thunderous roar. Heart thumping, Jee whips around to where the Moose Lion is still attempting to dislodge it\u2019s foot. The beast has apparently grown desperate and is thrashing wildly, it\u2019s great hulking mass slamming into the side of the mountain. The mountain lets lose a very ominous rumble, followed by a terrifying crack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee has about five seconds to register why that is not a good thing, before his hands find Prince Zuko\u2019s wrist. The boy lets out an indignant squawk as Jee slams him against the cliffside, before pressing his own body as close to the side as he can.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPRESS AS CLOSE TO CLIFFSIDE AS YOU CAN!\u201d he yelled at the rest of the party, \u201cNOW!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another slam against the mountain, a louder rumble and suddenly an avalanche of rocks are raining down the mountainside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u2018I don't get paid enough for this.\u2019\u00a0 </em>Is Jee's only thought as rocks the size of small houses fell\u00a0 mere inches in front of him. He can barely hear his own heart beat or the panicked yells of his men of the thunderous crash of rocks against earth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no!\u201d If Jee wasn\u2019t so familiar with his Prince\u2019s voice, he might've thought that horrified whisper came from someone else. He feels an unhealthy\u00a0 amount of vindication at the Prince\u2019s fear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018Yes, this is what happens when you charge in head first, you little brat!\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But when he looks over at\u00a0 Prince Zuko he sees that the boy isn\u2019t looking at the rocks. No, he\u2019s looking at the Moose Lion! The Beast's furious roars have been replaced by loud high pitched yelps of fear and Jee would almost feel sorry for it\u2026 if it hadn't caused the avalanche in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee is more concerned with the safety and survival of his Prince and crew, which is why he has a miniature heart attack when Prince Zuko suddenly surges forward. Jee just barely manages to snatch onto his arm, pinning the suicidal idiot in place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING!?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s stuck!\u201d The Prince yelled back, fighting against Jee\u2019s\u00a0 ironclad hold on his arm. \u201dWe have to help it! It\u2019ll be killed!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What in Agni\u2019s name was this child on!? \u201c<b> <em>You\u2019ll</em> </b> be killed! Stay put-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the Prince is done listening. Before Jee even has a chance to register what is happening, the Prince breaks out of his hold and barrels down the mountain path at top speed, weaving through the rockslide. Jee curses viciously and presses back into the path\u2019s wall unable to do anything else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Moose Lion roars as it spots Zuko approaching, it tusks flashing menacingly, but the Prince pays it no mind. He nimbly dodges a tumbling boulder, and without even pausing to think, brings his leg down in a mighty kick, effectively breaking the large rock trapping it\u2019s paw into tiny pieces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly <em> shit </em>.\u201d Jee hears Jin whispers. Jee would echo the sentiment, if he wasn\u2019t worried out of his mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Zuko!\u201d Jee can barely hear himself over the rumbling. \u201c TAKE COVER!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But his warning has the opposite effect. Distracted by his yell, Prince Zuko, who\u2019d been focusing on dodging boulders now that the beast was freed, abruptly loses his concentration and takes a well sized rock to the temple. Jee can only watch in horror as the Prince goes down, hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPRINCE ZUKO!\u201d Jee is dimly aware of the rest of the men letting out loud dismayed\u00a0 exclamations, but he barely registers it. All he could see was his Prince, lying motionless on the ground, helpless in the middle of a rock avalanche and at the mercy of a vicious beast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>TIme loses its meaning. The rocks are\u00a0 not letting up and Jee can not get to his Prince and the men are still screaming, and the mountain is still shaking and the beast is looming over Prince Zuko and the boy is no longer on the ground but clutched between lethal jaws and\u00a0 the beast is running, dodging the rocks and disappearing through the trees and Jee could only blink at the retreating beast, his body immobilized by horrified disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Jee comes back to himself, the mountain is once again calm, the Prince is still gone and Jin is pulling at his arm, his face a mask of panic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, the Prince was taken by that Beast!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWHAT DO WE DO!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDO MOOSE LIONS EAT HUMANS?\u201d<br><br></p>\n<p>\u201cOH SHIT! WHO'S GOING TO TELL THE GENERAL!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNOT ME!\u201d<br><br>\u201cSILENCE!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The men instantly quiet under Jee\u2019s fierce glare.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPanicking is not going to get the Prince back. Moose Lions usually take their prey back to their den. If we want to save him we need to move NOW. Pull yourselves together and follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is not hard to track the beast, thanks to its huge footprints. As they follow the trail, Jee internally fumes, torn between worry and rage.\u00a0 They're gonna track down the Moose Lion, retrieve their Prince and when they got back to the ship he was going to tear that IDIOT CHILD a new one, Prince or not!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee doesn\u2019t know what he expects when they finally arrive at the Moose Lion den. Part of him thinks (hopes) the prince has regained consciousness and found a way to escape. Another part of him is terrified\u00a0 that he\u2019ll find the Prince, but he won't find him alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d Haku\u2019s low whisper\u00a0 breaks Jee out of his morbid thoughts. \u201cLook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee follows the other finger and nearly jumps as he spots the Moose Lion, pacing in front of its den, and just beyond its massive frame, pale and unmoving,\u00a0 is\u2026..</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Zuko!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Jee severely underestimates the Beast\u2019s\u00a0 hearing. He barely refrains from squeaking in fear alongside his men as the Moose Lion\u2019s head swivels in his direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee feels like he is rooted to the ground, as those beady black eyes bore into his and that lethal mouth shifts into a threatening snarl.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t move, doesn't even dare to breathe, least he angers the beast and seals the fate of the unconscious boy at its feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tense stand-off seemed to go on forever, until in a move that contributed to the\u00a0 emergence of at least 50 new gray hairs, the Moose Lion broke eye contact\u00a0 with Jee and lowered its\u00a0 head down. No one dared make a sound as the beast gently pressed its snout against Prince Zuko\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took\u00a0 everything that Jee had not to lash out at the beast and drown it in fire. The little brat may get on his nerves but he was still his Prince and he was still a child. No self-respecting adult could watch a child get mauled by a beast and not want to save them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, as it turns out, the Moose Lion had no intention of mauling the Prince. Nope,\u00a0 no intention at all, if the way it was lovingly nuzzling his temple was any indication.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee couldn't tear his eyes away from the tender display.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was the \u2026. beast friendly? Was he wrong in his assessments? Could the violent, volatile nature the world associates with the creatures be false? Was everything he thought he knew about Sabre Tooth Moose Lions a lie?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee hesitantly takes a step forward\u2026.only to immediately retreat several paces when the Moose Lion lets out a ground-shattering roar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nope, not a lie then.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Moose Lion glowers at him for a few more seconds before happily returning to nuzzling Prince Zuko\u2019s cheek with a gentleness that one would only show their own offspring.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Haku whimpers as Jee stumbles away from the shelter of the trees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think a Sabre Tooth Moose Lion just abducted our Prince.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">0000000000000000</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c.....And we\u2019ve been trying to get him back ever since.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To his credit, General Iroh doesn\u2019t immediately drown Jee in Dragonfire for relaying such a ridiculous tale. Honestly, if Jee hadn\u2019t lived it, he wouldn\u2019t believe the story either. He still kinda doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean to tell me that a Sabre Tooth Moose Lion has adopted my nephew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee can only shrug helplessly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir. Like I said, the beast doesn't want to hurt him.\u00a0 She just\u2026.doesn\u2019t seem to want to give him back and every attempt to retrieve him just seems to agitate her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if in response to his words, the Moose Lion paws angrily\u00a0 at the ground once more, causing an assortment of tremors\u00a0 to shake the earth. Then, with a contradictory amount of gentleness, it carefully lays a mighty paw on their Prince\u2019s chest. It keeps its glare on them the entire time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>General Iroh\u2019s brow disappears behind his hairline.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026..see.\u201d\u00a0 It takes everything in Jee not to start fidgeting like a new cadet as the General lapses into silence. He can practically see his credibility as a competent leader going up in flames.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Let\u2019s just set the damn beast on fire and be done with it!.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently literally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c Yuji, please explain to me why you think it\u2019s a good idea to flame the Sabre Tooth Moose Lion that is currently holding our prince hostage. It can't be because you might agitate the beast who would in turn trample the Prince and attack us. OR because you might accidentally hit the Prince.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of Yuji\u2019s bravado abruptly disappears in the wake of Jee\u2019s scathing glare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI-um-I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI assure you gentlemen, there need not be any idiotic acts of violence. Allow me to handle this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d General Iroh merely smiles at him. This time it\u2019s more reassuring than terrifying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe this is\u00a0 all just a misunderstanding as well as a\u2026. difference in opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Jee can ask what he means. General Iroh\u00a0 is breaking away from their group and walking purposely toward the Moose Lion\u2019s den. It\u2019s such an unexpected move Jee doesn\u2019t register it until the General is mere inches away from the Moose Lion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is he doing?!\u201d Jin whispers, terrified. \u201c Why is he just walking up to it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee doesn\u2019t answer. He\u2019s too busy tearing at his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Moose Lion keeps a wary eye on Iroh as he approaches, but otherwise does react as he stops\u00a0 just a few inches before the mouth of the den.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood Afternoon, Madam.\u201d Jee starts at General Iroh\u2019s pleasant tone. \u201cI must say, you\u2019ve done a fantastic job of caring for my nephew and I do thank you for that, however I\u2019m going to have to insist that you return my nephew to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee cannot believe what he\u2019s currently witnessing. Why was his General having a conversation with a wild animal? Were the rumors true? Did insanity truly run in the Royal Family!?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Moose Lion regards General Iroh stoically for a few seconds before tossing her head.<br><br></p>\n<p>\u201cYour apprehension is appreciated but unfounded Ma\u2019am. I understand you have not been shown the best example of the care that he receives with us, but I assure you , he is quite safe with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Beast regards him and to Jee's utter amazement the Moose Lion snorts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honest to Agni snorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>General Iroh is unperturbed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat,\u201d he points at Zuko, \u201cIs my nephew.\u00a0 I care for him deeply and I would appreciate it if you return him to me, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Jee\u2019s mounting disbelief it looks as if the beast is actually considering the General\u2019s words. Then in a deliberate show of defiance the Moose Lion uses a paw to delicately slide Prince Zuko's body closer to her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u2018Try and take him.\u2019 </em>Her eyes seemed to say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What \u2026. Was happening?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201dIf that's how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d General Iroh shifts into a fighting stance, \u201c If I must take him back by force, I will.\u201d There is a lethal promise in his words and Jee and the men instinctively scramble behind the cover of the trees, on principal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Man and Moose stare each other down. After about five minutes into their tense exchange,\u00a0 the Moose Lion let out a slight huff. Her head tilts to the side, the hostility fading\u00a0 from her gaze, replaced with something almost looks like\u2026 respect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Jee can contemplate the eerily humanlike expression, the Moose is shifting,the paw she was using to cover Prince Zuko now being used to push him toward General Iroh. The General slowly shifts out of his fighting stance, his fierce expression morphing into one of gratitude.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jee holds his breath as General Iroh steps forward and bundles the Prince into his arms. THe Prince stirs just a bit and Jee feels a bit of tension leave his shoulders. The Moose Lion doesn\u2019t so much as twitch, though she does eye Jee menacingly out of the corner of her eye. Jee glares back with just as much force.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have my eternal gratitude for saving and looking after my nephew, Madam. Your protection will not go unrewarded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The General bows as formally as he can with his nephew in his arms and starts to head in Jee\u2019s direction. Jee and the Moose Lion hold each other\u2019s stare until the General passes him and continues on. Only then does Jee deem it safe enough to turn his back on the creature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>They make the trip back to the ship in silence, No one relaxes until they see the tip of the ship's burner peeking out over the trees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Immediately the rest of the men stumble down to galley. No doubt to drown themselves in alcohol and regale the other crewmates with the fantastical events that took place. NOt that they would believe them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee opts to follow the General down to The Prince\u2019s quarters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, General Iroh, may I ask how you were able to outmaneuver that beast and retrieve Prince Zuko?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no out maneuvering on my part\u00a0 at all Lt. Jee.\u201d<br><br></p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cContrary to popular belief Lt. Jee, Sabre Tooth Moose Lions are perfectly amicable and reasonable animals. While temperamental and territorial if they or theirs are threatened they are actually very parental. Most do not know this due to their fearsome reputation,\u00a0 but Moose Lions are known as nanny animals due to their natural disposition to care for and foster young of different species.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't see what that has to do with why the Moose Lion took the Prince or why she wouldn\u2019t return him to us.\u201d General Iroh momentarily stops tucking in the Prince and looks over at him. The smile on his face is a bit disconcerting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently, Madam Moose Lion found your care of Zuko quite lacking, and\u00a0 was thus reluctant to release him back to you, lest he come to more harm.\u00a0 However, as I was prepared to challenge her head on, she saw that she could trust me to care for him and happily relinquished him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee takes a minute to process the meaning behind that revelation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou mean, she was protecting him\u2026. from us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee\u2019s pride had suffered a lot today but that, somehow, that was the worst hit of all.\u00a0 How bad of a Quartermaster was he if a vicious wild animal thought his Captain was safer with her than with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would take awhile to get over that. Maybe he\u2019d join the men in the galley for a drink, after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c Do send the Doctor down, Lieutenant. \u201c General Iroh calls after his retreating form, \u201cand make sure the ship stays docked for the time being . I would think my nephew would like to personally thank Madam Moose Lion.\u201d</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Prince does indeed jump at the chance to personally thank his Moose Lion Savior, once he stops seeing double, and the knot on his head shrinks. All thoughts on the Avatar lead are forgotten as they trudge through the forest to the Moose\u2019 Lion den.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee tries and falls not to scream as the hulking beast outright tackles Prince Zuko the second she sees him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only the fact that the Prince is not screaming in agony from having his bones crushed that keeps Jee from going into cardiac arrest. In fact, the Moose Lion is cradling Prince Zuko in her paws\u00a0 as tenderly as one would a newborn Owlkitten. It's worth noting that\u00a0 Prince Zuko is not the slightest bit perturbed by these happenings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle, did you bring the dried meat for Mango?\u201d Prince Zuko calls over the Moose Lion\u2019s loud happy purrs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Jee blinks in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWhose Mango?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Moose Lion.\u201d General Iroh\u00a0 as if it was obvious . As if most people went around naming dangerous animals after fruit. \u201cIt\u2019s what Zuko decided to call her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe named it?\u201d Is what Jee says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u2018He named it MANGO?\u2019\u00a0 </em>Is what Jee thinks. <em> \u2018You let him name it Mango!?\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we certainly couldn\u2019t keep calling her Moose LIon.\u201d General Iroh says with a chuckle. \u201cThat would be rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jee\u2019s natural response to that would have been that wild animals have no concept of rudeness, but after the events of the previous day, he\u2019s not so sure anymore. Jee watches as Prince Zuko happily feeds the Moose Lion scraps of dried meat and contemplates the most recent events.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not only had the Prince down what until recently had seemed impossible and somehow tamed a Moose Lion but he\u2019d also named it Mango. Mango the Moose Lion. Mango.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It hits him suddenly then, when he takes the time to think about it. By the time it registers Jee can\u2019t even stop it, the smile is already pulling at his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mango the Moose Lion. Jee shakes his head with a soft chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dammit, that was adorable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> (Jee really doesn\u2019t feel like smiling, however, when Prince Zuko declares that they are to make yearly stops to visit Mango.) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> (Just be grateful I talked him down from monthly visits, Lieutenant.) </em>\n</p>\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the story of how Zuko was adopted by a Sabre Tooth Moose Lion.\u201d Iroh takes a long satisfying sip of tea and basks in the young faces painted in various shades of disbelief. Aang is the first to break the silence , his eyes pinning a sheepish Zuko with an irritated glower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you get all the cool pets?\u201d he pouts , throwing a longing gaze at Druk, who's curled around Momo and Froggy, \u201cIt\u2019s not FAIR!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko stares at him blankly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAang\u2026 you have\u2026. a flying bison.\u201d Aang merely huffs as Katara gently\u00a0 pats his arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSparky, this is important. \u201d Toph says, turning to stare at Zuko intensely, \u201cDid you go back and visit Mango and did she remember you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery year in fact.\u201d Iroh answered for him, ignoring Katara\u2019s soft whisper of<em> \u2018Of course\u2019 </em>, \u201c And she did indeed remember him and I unfortunately found myself having the same\u00a0 argument with her every time we visited. She grew even more insistent on keeping him with her after she had a litter of her own. \u201c\u00a0 Iroh takes another sip of tea. \u201c It drove Lt. Jee insane. They never did quite learn to get along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of which, with everything that happened, we missed our visit with her this year. She must be so worried. I\u2019m going to have to spend a few extra days with her to make up for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven't tried to move her to the Palace.\u201d Zuko actually looks mildly offended at that.<br><br></p>\n<p>\u201c I wouldn't do that to her Katara! Of course I\u2019d like her closer but she\u2019s meant to be in the wild. I\u2019d have to put her in an enclosure and that would make her miserable! I am worried about her though. I hear Moose Lion hunting has increased over the past few months. I do hope King Kuei got my proposal about classifying Moose Lions as a protected species. Maybe I should send him another messenger hawk-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Zuko begins to fret, Katara turns to stare at Sokka, who\u2019d been strangely quiet. After shifting under her intense gaze for a few minutes, Sokka couldn't take it anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're not going to say anything?\u201d Katara asks incredulously, \u201c After all the fuss you made about Froggy and Druk and Blaze-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don't talk about the <b> <em>Phoenix</em> </b>, Katara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not gonna overreact and scream about \u2018freaky spirit magic\u2019 or tackle unsuspecting bards?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst off, I don\u2019t appreciate your assasination of my character. I only tackled <b> <em>one </em> </b>bard, don't make it sound like it\u2019s a reoccurring thing. Secondly, normally I would do all that , but I actually understand this one. There\u2019s something sacred about the bond between a boy and his Sabre Tooth Moose Lion. That\u2019s not freaky spirit magic, that\u2019s just being claimed. You wouldn\u2019t understand, Katara. It\u2019s an \u2018in the know\u2019 kinda thing.\u201d Katara rolls her eyes at Sokka\u2019s haughty handwave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course. We can't forget about little\u00a0 Foo Foo CuddlyPoops, can we.\u201d Sokka flinches violently as Zuko stops his proposal planning and looks over at them curiously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhose Foo Foo CuddlyPoops?\u201d Sokka flinches even harder and pointedly looks away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmmmmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Toph barks out a laugh as Aang giggles and a positively evil smirk spreads across Katara\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the name of Sokka\u2019s own little Moose Lion Cub. Isn't it sooo cwute?\u201d Katara\u2019s smirk widens as Zuko turns to stare at Sokka.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou named a Sabre Tooth Moose Lion \u2018<em> Foo Foo CuddlyPoops </em>\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And there it was. Sokka figured this would come back to bite him in the butt. Karma never let\u00a0 him get away with anything for too long. He\u2019d gotten too comfortable making fun of Zuko\u2019s naming skills and ignored the fact that his own weren\u2019t any better. And now he was going to pay for it. The worst thing about it? Zuko deserved to throw this one in his face.\u00a0 He can\u2019t even complain about it. He can only sit there and wait for the epic teasing to commence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing of the sort happens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead a small smile devoid of any kind of mockery spreads across Zuko\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <b> <em>is</em> </b> a cute name for a Moose Lion cub. You wouldn\u2019t mind if I used that, would you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka stares at Zuko blankly. He\u2019s not the only one. Zuko begins to fidget as the weight of everyone\u2019s eyes pin him down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously Sparky?\u201d Zuko flushes under Toph \u2018s deadpan stare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c Well - I just - uh - AH!\u201d Zuko squawks in surprise as Sokka suddenly rockets\u00a0 across the room and throws his arms around Zuko\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Sokka?\u201d Sokka hugs him tighter and buries his face into Zuko\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't deserve you.\u201d</p>"
