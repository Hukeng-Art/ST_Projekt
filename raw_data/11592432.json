Thank you so much for following along and for all of your encouragement and comments \u2014 you really and truly make my day and inspire the writing bug. If you are so inclined to check out more in this general vein, I've written another (one-shot) fic this week chronicling Peter's coming of age through the people who raised him, and there is, as usual, plenty of angst and precious smol bean Peter and Tony Stark just tryna do the right thing. </p>\n<p>HAPPY WEEKEND!!! Sorry for the emotions (but like, we all knew it was gonna shake out this way, right?). As always, you can find me on upcamethesun.tumblr.com, my shady side blog where I basically stalk Tom Holland and reblog Spider-Man jokes like the well-adjusted individual that I am.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cHey, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter stops just outside the gates of Midtown Science like there\u2019s a sniper rifle viewfinder trained on him. Then he\u00a0sees Tony standing there, propped against the sleek and decidedly unsubtle car he pulled\u00a0up in, and his jaw partially unhinges itself from his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony cocks his head at him. \u201cGet in the car before people start rolling to a stop in front of you, your eyes look like traffic lights.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cM-Mr. Stark, hi, wow,\u201d says Peter, doing a predictably poor job of collecting himself as he hikes his backpack further up onto his shoulders and walks over to the car. He inexplicably fiddles with the zipper of his jacket, pulling it all the way up to his neck. \u201cUm, okay, where are we going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChuck E. Cheese,\u201d says Tony, opening the door for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t knock Chuck E. Cheese,\u201d says Peter, getting into the backseat, looking nervously behind his shoulder at his classmates as they start to funnel out. \u201cThe Ske-Ball machine on the one in Queens is rigged, you can get tickets for days \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do you a solid, kid, and pretend I didn\u2019t hear any of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYup, thanks,\u201d says Peter, gazing out at his campus through the tinted windows as the car drives away. He turns back to Tony abruptly, his eyes bright and earnest. \u201cIs there some kind of mission? I\u2019ve got my suit and my passport in my backpack \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy, kid. We\u2019re just going upstate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony wonders for a moment if there\u2019s a gentler, more \u201ckid who hangs on your every word\u201d-appropriate way to put it, but instead he cuts right to the chase: \u201cLook, I promise I\u2019m not trying to cramp your style or anything. But you\u2019re terrible at hand-to-hand combat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter\u2019s face is immediately redder than an emergency flare. \u201cBut \u2014\u00a0I mean, I\u2019m fine out on the \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, are you? I\u2019m guessing the bruises up and down your ribs from last night beg to differ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter creases his lips. \u201cBaby monitor,\u201d he mutters, looking out the window again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s skip past the part where you slam the metaphorical bedroom door and say I\u2019m ruining your life and cut to the chase \u2014 you may have super spider strength, but it\u2019s useless if you don\u2019t know how to use it. You\u2019re going to have weekly hand-to-hand combat sessions with Natasha at the tower, starting now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait \u2014\u00a0like, <em> Black Widow </em> Natasha?\u201d Peter blurts, all traces of offense gone as soon as they came. \u201cAre you <em> shitting </em> me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d says Tony, immediately wincing\u00a0because dear Jesus, he hates admitting to himself how much Cap has rubbed off on him. Still, it\u2019s not his fault that a swear word coming out of Peter Parker\u2019s baby face is about as jarring as watching a bird juggle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d says Peter. \u201c<em>Wow</em>. She doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf she did, we\u2019d know. Trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat. \u201cOh my god,\u201d says Peter gravely. \u201cShe\u2019s going to kick my ass. She\u2019s going to <em> murder </em>me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony crosses one of his legs over the other. \u201cYeah, well. At least you won\u2019t have to worry about the SATs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forty minutes and approximately one hundred questions later, Peter is at the compound and learning the basics from a surprisingly patient Natasha. Tony hasn\u2019t exactly come right out and told her that the punk kid and the Spider-Man that was fighting with them in Germany are one in the same, but only because he figures he doesn\u2019t have to \u2014 even if the kid\u2019s voice weren\u2019t painfully distinctive (so much for interrogation mode), Natasha is way too observant to be fooled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d says Natasha, when Peter actually manages to avoid a blow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Peter chipperly, even though he is nursing Natasha\u2019s recent uppercut to his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s not really committed to watching, only looking up from his screen every now and then, but even from here he can tell the kid is sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna take off that jacket, maybe?\u201d asks Natasha, beating Tony to the punch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head almost violently. \u201cN-nope, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha shrugs. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony leaves to take a call, and by the time he comes back Peter and Natasha are still at it \u2014 and the kid is <em> still </em> in his jacket, sweating so much that his entire face looks like someone lit his brain on fire inside of his skull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid,\u201d yells Tony. \u201cJust take off the jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha and Peter answer at the same time, Peter saying, \u201cI\u2019m good!\u201d and Natasha wryly echoing, \u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony scowls. He clearly isn\u2019t. Why on earth would Peter insist on wearing that ridiculous jacket for all two hours of \u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh. <em> Oh</em>. Tony doesn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t think of it earlier; the kid obviously got into some kind of scrape, and is trying to hide it from Tony <em> again</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPause,\u201d says Tony, raising a hand up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha pulls her punch back, and Peter teeters a bit on his feet, not quite as prepared to come to a full stop as Natasha was. Tony walks across the room to the two of them and crosses his arms in front of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJig\u2019s up, kid. Take off the jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s expression is so pained that it looks more like a kicked puppy on the side of the road than an Avenger-in-training. \u201cUm, no thanks,\u201d he bleats. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong answer,\u201d says Tony. He nods at the zipper. \u201cOff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d says Peter, pleadingly. \u201cUm \u2014\u00a0if anything, it\u2019s cold in here \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t test me, kid. Take it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t move for a moment, but Tony knows it will only take a few seconds for the kid to shrink under his gaze. Sure enough, slowly, excruciatingly, Peter\u2019s hand lifts to the zipper of his jacket. He pauses for a moment, his face more miserable than Tony has ever seen it in all the months of knowing him, and unzips the jacket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first Tony is so focused on looking for whatever ridiculous bodily injury the kid is trying to hide that he doesn\u2019t even notice the real source of embarrassment; it isn\u2019t until Natasha turns away and tries to hold back a snicker that Tony goes off the offensive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a birthday present,\u201d says Peter miserably. \u201cAlso \u2014 I just \u2014\u00a0it was my turn to do laundry, and I haven\u2019t done it yet \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dear God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Don\u2019t laugh. Don\u2019t laugh. Don\u2019t \u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Emblazoned on the now painfully sweaty cotton t-shirt on Peter\u2019s torso is an image of the Iron Man logo, accompanied with the words, \u201cKEEP CALM AND IRON ON.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony tries to hold in a wheeze, and even charitably considers, for a half a beat, turning the other cheek and letting the kid off the hook. But he can\u2019t keep it up \u2014\u00a0he takes one look at Natasha, who is practically holding her breath trying not to laugh, and within a second the two of them burst into merciless cackles as Peter covers his face with his hands and all but melts into the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKill me,\u201d says Peter to Natasha. \u201cI know you can. Just <em> do </em> it \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, come on, kid,\u201d says Tony, slapping him on the back so hard that he stumbles a bit despite all of his uncanny, radioactive insect-induced strength. \u201cDon\u2019t <em> sweat </em> it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This, of course, only makes Natasha laugh harder, because the kid is so caked in his own sweat from keeping the shirt under wraps that he looks like someone just dragged him out of a lake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll never live this down,\u201d Peter mutters under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Tony agrees, the smile still curled across his face. \u201cNow please go get some water before you pass out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter obliges, murmuring to himself under his breath as he goes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd hey, kid,\u201d Natasha calls. \u201cIf you forget what I taught you\u00a0in training, just remember to keep calm and iron on!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter stops short and turns to her. \u201cBetrayed by my fellow spider,\u201d he deadpans, before he picks back up again and walks away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToo harsh?\u201d asks Natasha, her eyes glinting, as soon as Peter is out of sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs. \u201cEh. A little hazing is healthy. Prep the kid for college and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly <em> how </em> old is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe approximate age of someone who unironically owns a \u2018Keep Calm And Iron On\u2019 shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c... Fair enough.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u201cUm, hello?\u201d<span class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">Tony scowls as the call comes through, knowing that if Happy bothered to forward it along, it can\u2019t mean anything good. \u201cTed, is it?\u201d he asks, walking to a less crowded side of the rooftop and narrowly avoiding half a dozen ridiculously well-dressed people trying to flag him down to talk.<span class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u201cNo. Um, it\u2019s Ned.\u201d<span class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u201cHow did you get my associate\u2019s number, Fred?\u201d<span class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u201cYou mean Happy\u2019s?\u201d<span class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u201cYou don\u2019t even know which of the seven dwarves you\u2019ve been calling?\u201d asks Tony, waving back at a man whose name he definitely does not remember, that Pepper will no doubt have to remind him about when she\u2019s back from the bathroom.<span class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-p1\">\u201cNo, I \u2014\u00a0yes, I\u2019ve been calling Happy.

Then pulls out his phone and finds Ned's number, texting the picture of Peter with the caption,\u00a0<em>Do with this what you will</em>.<span class=\"m_-4097134374622677504gmail-Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s been sitting in the little Italian restaurant in midtown Pepper picked out for ten minutes when her text comes through: <em> Smoothing things over with a late shipment, promise I\u2019m on my way! </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to flag down the waiter to go ahead and order a drink while he waits, but his line of sight is interrupted by the hostess, who is shepherding a teen who looks so out of place by himself in this moderately nice restaurant that Tony can\u2019t help but look up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course. Of <em> course </em> the one time Tony is stopping for dinner in a city of millions, he would end up seated across from one Peter Parker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid hasn\u2019t seen him yet, fidgeting with his phone, his eyes flitting between the time stamp on the screen and the restaurant\u2019s front doors. He\u2019s dressed in a pair of khakis and with a button down shirt under his sweater, a step up from his usual ironic nerd tees, but the whole <em> look </em> is slightly thrown off by the kid\u2019s unbridled panic and the fact that his hair looks like a stuffed animal someone accidentally ran through the washing machine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony clears his throat. Peter looks up, locks eyes with him, and immediately registers the kind of horror on his face of someone who stepped out in front of a bus.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you <em> doing </em> here?\u201d he demands, his voice cracking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to see you too, kid,\u201d says Tony, leaning back in his seat.

Well, you\u2019ve got a little something in your teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cI do?\u201d he says, running his tongue over them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. But you are bleeding slightly out of the top of your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d says Peter. His hand flies up to his forehead, where he starts rubbing at it with his palm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony sighs. \u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d he asks, dabbing his napkin in his glass of water and leaning across the table to hand it to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my defense, the tree ran into <em> me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind. Plausible deniability.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony watches carefully as the kid pulls the napkin away from his forehead, but he can tell whatever he did to himself is already healing and decides not to press the point.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, so \u2014 are you \u2026 eating here? Or are you finished eating?\u201d asks Peter hopefully, his eyes flitting back to the outside window.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, kid. I\u2019m not going to tell your aunt about that little incident in the East River last week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting for my aunt,\u201d says Peter, \u201cI\u2019m waiting for \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, dork squad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony ducks his head into the menu just as the girl walks up to the table seemingly out of nowhere. He can only see the back of her \u2014\u00a0long hair, jeans, a pair of combat boots, and a slouch with a defiance in it Tony can detect without even seeing her face. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only then does it dawn on him what\u2019s happening here: the kid is on a <em> date</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony has half a mind to call Pepper and tell her they\u2019re calling off the Broadway musical she wants to see tonight. The real show is right here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMJ,\u201d says Peter, standing up so quickly that he bangs his knee on the table and nearly knocks the silverware off it. \u201cYou look \u2014 you look nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She seems to hesitate for a moment, then reaches forward and half-nudges, half-punches him in the shoulder in response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look terrible either,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter smiles at her like it\u2019s Christmas, but he\u2019s also a little scared about it. Then his eyes shift a bit to the left, where Tony is still watching him with mirth, and the smile half-slides off his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, uh, let\u2019s sit,\u201d Peter stammers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBanner idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As they settle in Tony\u2019s gives Peter a thumbs up and mouths the words \u201cYou got this\u201d as Peter\u2019s face steadily turns redder and redder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your \u2026 day going?\u201d says Peter, trying to duck his head so Tony can\u2019t make eye contact with him. (It doesn\u2019t work.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean in the last two hours since you saw me?\u201d the girl \u2014\u00a0 MJ, the kid called her \u2014 asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, those two,\u201d says Peter, seeming to relax into himself a bit. \u201cGive me all the deets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBlogging. Reading. Making quiz cards for you dweebs so we can crush regionals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter tilts her head at her. \u201cYou mean flash cards?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm, no. I don\u2019t want Flash\u2019s ego inflated anymore than it already is so I renamed them in an abundance of caution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Peter, a broad, knowing smile curling on his face. \u201cSmart thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By now the kid\u2019s completely forgotten Tony is here, which is remarkable, considering Tony has been making faces at him behind his date\u2019s back throughout the conversation. Maybe Tony even feels a little bit bad about it, watching the way the kid watches her \u2014 with that wholehearted, rapt\u00a0kind of look in his eyes, that brand of skittish teenage love that is all good intentions and awkward nods and knocking over the water glass with your elbow before the waiter takes your order. It\u2019s a relief, almost, to see the kid capable of something so \u2026 ordinary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was another day of polishing Iron Man\u2019s boots?\u201d the girl asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes flit back to Tony for a split second so fast that even Tony almost misses it. \u201cOh, you know. Long hours,\u201d he says. Then, very clearly and with undisguised irony, he deadpans, \u201cSometimes it feels like they have <em> no regard for my personal life</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony has to cough to cover the sharp laugh that almost betrays him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh. Well, there\u2019s always OsCorp.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony looks up sharply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what MJ? That is a <em> great </em> idea,\u201d says Peter. \u201cA phenomenal one. The best idea I\u2019ve ever \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes accidentally meet Tony\u2019s glare and he stops mid-sentence like someone sucked the air out of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c... heard,\u201d he finishes, reaching for his water glass and taking an absurdly long sip. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Parker, you don\u2019t have to suddenly start being all\u00a0<em> nice </em> to me just because I agreed to go on \u2026 whatever this is with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s brow creases. \u201cI\u2019m always nice to you.

I forgot.\u201d She leans back in her chair and seems to give Peter a once-over. \u201cWow, and you <em>still</em> wanted to do this? Your self-esteem must be at like, rock <em> bottom</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d says Peter wryly. He blinks at her then, and looks down at the table and then back up and says, \u201cSeriously, though, I\u2019m \u2026 glad you were down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat, and she must acknowledge him in some quiet way, because Peter lights up faster than he did he when Tony offered to let him design a few of his own web shooter combinations.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh. Don\u2019t make it weird,\u201d she says. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter smiles this patient kind of smile Tony\u2019s never seen before, something grounded and assured and nothing like Tony ever felt as a teenager \u2014\u00a0hell, even as an adult. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s phone rings, then, vibrating on the table so loudly that they both jump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my aunt,\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it, take it. I want some alone time with this menu anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d asks Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl waves him off. \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter picks up the phone and ducks out of his seat. The moment he leaves the restaurant, the girl wrenches her body around to face Tony so abruptly that he almost startles. For a moment the two of them just stare at each other. Her gaze is so leveling that he might actually be a little bit intimidated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, for Christ\u2019s sake. These toddlers can\u2019t even <em> drive </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s falling asleep in class, you know,\u201d she says bluntly. The words are innocuous, but her tone is accusatory.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d asks Tony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She leans forward and grabs one of the pieces of bread out of the basket on his table, then takes a graceless bite out of the side of her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell him not to patrol so late,\u201d she tells him through her chews. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one he listens to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony doesn\u2019t move a muscle \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s rare that he doesn\u2019t immediately have a backup plan when he\u2019s caught on the spot.\u00a0Then again, it's even rarer that he gets verbally\u00a0knocked on his ass by a teenage girl in the time it takes for him to tie his shoes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d she mutters, her lip curling, a little smug at the\u00a0reaction he apparently didn't hide well enough. \u201cI knew something was up before he started running around Queens in those pajamas last year. You don\u2019t go home with the flu and come back three days later with biceps like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony watches in mild horror as she yanks another chunk of the bread wedge off with her molars and casually upends every assumption Tony has made in the last ten minutes. He\u2019s used to being wrong, sure, but even he\u2019s not used to being <em> this </em> wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her voice is low and surprisingly guarded when she speaks again. \u201cAnyway, he doesn\u2019t know that I know, so don\u2019t wreck that for him.\u201d She thinks for a second, the vulnerability gone as soon as it came. \u201cOr me. Honestly, watching him try to lie about dressing up like a giant bug every night is like, my new favorite extracurricular activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho <em> are </em> you, exactly?\u201d Tony asks, half in alarm, half in awe. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She ignores him. \u201cI have to pee. Watch my purse,\u201d she says, slinging it on her chair and sliding out of the table without so much as a glance back. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Tony can even begin to process what was surely a mild hallucination he just endured, Pepper walks in, cheeks red from the cold and her usual hurry. \u201cHey, you,\u201d she says, \u201csorry I\u2019m late. Who was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony blinks. \u201cUh,\u201d he manages. \u201cEither\u00a0future of SHIELD or the death of us all, I can't decide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He fills Pepper in on the situation to afford the kid some small shred of dignity; when he walks back in, Pepper nods at him with a quiet smile and winks, and Peter half-waves back at her, clearly relieved that Tony\u2019s leash has arrived.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOsCorp, kid?\u201d says Tony, before MJ returns from the bathroom. \u201cLow blow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLower than you think,\u201d Peter mutters back, settling into his seat. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony scowls, but before he can ask for any elaboration on <em> that </em> cryptic statement, Peter\u2019s girlfriend-but-not-girlfriend strolls back out. Tony opens his mouth anyway, but Pepper kicks him under the table. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be fair, Tony totally was planning on leaving the punks alone after that \u2014\u00a0he only has to sneak a few glances of the two of them eating their ravioli to get the gist of how insufferably precious and awkward they are. He hates to admit it, but maybe it warms his jaded heart a bit to see Peter, as unsure and unsettled as he is prone to being, look genuinely at ease for the first time since Tony met him \u2014\u00a0to know that there\u2019s one more person looking out for him, even if he doesn\u2019t know it just yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s a remarkable kid. It only makes sense that he\u2019d have remarkable friends, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, that sentimental notion goes crashing right out the window as soon as Peter and the girl get up to leave the restaurant. MJ pauses deliberately in front of Tony, her eyes narrowing at him; behind her Peter freezes like someone has hit him with a stun gun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says, leaning over the table as if to get a better look at him. \u00a0\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you look like a much, much older version of Tony Stark? It\u2019s <em> uncanny</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pepper splutters into her drink trying not to laugh as MJ walks away. Peter lingers for a moment, clearly trying to decide whether or not to apologize, and ultimately says something utterly\u00a0incoherent and half-chases the girl out the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Tony turns back to Pepper, her eyes are shining with her effort not to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d says Tony warningly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pepper smirks at him. \u201cCan we adopt her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if you want Peter to live.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony is blasting music and tinkering with a new alloy combination in the lab when the music abruptly cuts itself off, a call coming through. Tony sees the caller ID and immediately pulls up the Baby Monitor feed, hearing Peter before he actually picks up. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Karen, I said <em> don\u2019t </em> call Tony Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCalling Tony Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKaren. Karen. Stay with me here. I said <em> not </em> to \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cConnected to Tony Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor fu \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 ck\u2019s sake,\u201d Peter mutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYikes. Do you kiss your aunt with that mouth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKaren\u2019s broken,\u201d says Peter, clearly agitated on the other line. \u201cI told her not to call you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony peers at the night vision on the screen. \u201cConsidering you have two feet stuck in quick dry cement in an empty construction site, I\u2019m going to go ahead and say she\u2019s working just fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat. \u201cI can get out of it myself. I just need a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> That\u2019s not why Karen called</em>, Tony almost says, but he doesn\u2019t want to embarrass the kid. The less Peter knows about the systems Tony put in place for the AI in his suit to detect any changes in his vital signs, the better. Especially because right now the kid\u2019s heart rate is through the roof.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony doesn\u2019t have to ask why. He saw the security footage, in the aftermath of the incident with the Vulture \u2014 watched as Peter walked into the building, watched how minutes later the whole thing came tumbling down on top of him. The kid hasn\u2019t said a word about it to anyone, but it only took two weeks of trying to figure out the inexplicable spikes in his readouts to know that he\u2019s been skittish around construction sites and parking structures and anything reminiscent of that warehouse ever since. It\u2019s rare, though, that it gets this bad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you <em> not </em> attempt a DIY cement extrication in that multimillion dollar suit, so sit tight,\u201d says Tony. \u201cOr, er \u2014 stand tight. Be there in five.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no snappy comeback, no dorky little quip. Tony hangs up before Peter can hear his sigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gets there a minute earlier than he told the kid he would, and he feels a familiar twinge of responsibility and regret when he sees that the kid is completely tense, his eyes trained on his feet, his chest inflating a little too much with each breath. Tony engages the thrusters a bit so the kid hears the noise and sure enough, he collects himself the moment Tony is in his sightline.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, collects himself as much as he can for a kid whose feet have disappeared into a murky gray mass and is holding \u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that an <em> egg? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter holds said egg a little closer to him, the gesture curiously protective. \u201cNed said he was feeling too much like a single parent and I had to contribute, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony squints at him. \u201cDid you hit your head again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Peter, \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 it\u2019s for school. You get partnered up and take care of an egg. For, like \u2026 learning about responsible parenting? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, his words coming too fast, his eyes grazing the half-finished roof. \u201cCan you just \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, on it,\u201d says Tony, holding back the <em> many </em> merciless comments he plans on making as soon as the kid is freed. It only takes a few seconds, but the kid doesn\u2019t say anything more, watching with an uncharacteristically still kind of focus as Tony dislodges his feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Peter, as most of the cement is cleared. \u201cAnd, uh, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, don\u2019t beat yourself up. You haven\u2019t done anything moronic in this suit in like two whole months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWoo,\u201d Peter deadpans, his feet crunching slightly as he walks out of the construction site with a determination and speed that are too deliberate to be casual. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony follows him close behind. \u201cNow, are you going to introduce me to your \u2026 son? Daughter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re electing to let the egg decide its gender when it\u2019s old enough,\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. That seems like a much sounder parenting choice than, say, taking it out to fight crime with you at 11 p.m. on a school night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They finally clear the construction zone and Peter pulls his mask off, his face a little too pale, his eyes a little too wide. He deliberately doesn\u2019t look at Tony, focusing instead on his hand and saying, \u201cWhat can I say? Like father, like egg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lull, then, where Tony\u2019s supposed to clap the kid on the back, say something embarrassing to take the edge off, and fly home. But he sees that tremor in Peter\u2019s hand, sees that slight glaze that hasn\u2019t left his eyes, and something stalls him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cText your aunt and tell her you\u2019re spending the night at HQ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to chip the rest of that concrete off your suit,\u201d says Tony, \u201cand I\u2019d prefer if the instructions for it didn\u2019t come from YouTube.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few minutes and several pictures proving that both Peter and his egg are unharmed later, he has the all clear from his aunt. Tony calls a car so he doesn\u2019t have to half-drag the kid upstate like a limp noodle, and also because even if he did, Peter seems so genuinely concerned about the welfare of his tiny egg that Tony suspects he too would have secondhand anxiety about it being so high up in the air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they get into the car, Peter pulls out his webbing and makes a tiny little nest for it, propping it in the empty space between them as if it is the most normal thing in the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we talk, or will we wake the baby?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis egg is worth, like, half my grade,\u201d says Peter. \u201cAnd Ned\u2019s. If anything happens to it, he\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be able to hold your own against Fred.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPhysically, sure. But I meant emotionally. Psychologically. He\u2019d kill me dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid, at least, seems a little bit more at ease now, even if he is talking nonsense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long, exactly, is this state-funded, extremely competitive, nationally-ranked school requiring you to walk around tending to an expired dairy product?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo weeks. Tomorrow\u2019s the last day, thank god,\u201d says Peter, with the weary affect of someone who <em> actually </em> has a child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Parenthood seems to have done a number on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you never had kids?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The question comes so fast and so unexpectedly that Tony has to fight the reflex that says <em> None of your business </em>or some similarly defensive, snarky variation of it that the kid certainly doesn\u2019t deserve. He isn\u2019t asking the way people normally ask \u2014 in that presumptuous, concerned, or even critical way people have asked in the past. Peter, as always, seems just plain curious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs. \u201cJust was never quite suited for it, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter looks at him a little disbelievingly, but doesn\u2019t press the point.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Timing. The lifestyle,\u201d says Tony anyway, not even sure why he\u2019s elaborating or even which part he\u2019s elaborating on. \u201cIt\u2019s not very \u2026 kid-friendly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds himself staring at the little egg in its misshapen web nest, blinking away something that never was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he says abruptly, \u201cI should probably warn you that I have guests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, cool, cool. I\u2019m fine on the couch \u2014 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I had guests, not a national army,\u201d says Tony. \u201cYour room\u2019s still empty, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s ears visibly redden. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, a happy little lift in his voice that Tony isn\u2019t expecting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony clears his throat. \u201cNo nursery, though, so the egg is gonna have to make do,\u201d he recovers. \u201cAnyway, you might want to decide if you\u2019re going in there as Spider-Punk or Peter Parker before you run into anyone in the hallway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm \u2014 I guess I\u2019ll just put on the mask,\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late when they get back, quiet enough that Tony walks Peter down to the empty room himself. It\u2019s not a very long walk, but just long enough for them to fall into a stilted silence \u2014 just long enough for Tony to wonder if maybe he should use that silence to talk to Peter about the whole panicking in large empty buildings thing. Before he can, though, a shadow meets them in the hall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony looks up, about to remind Vision about personal space, but it isn\u2019t Vision at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC-Cap,\u201d Peter startles, taking a step back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony sizes the other man up \u2014 the dark clothing, the newly acquired beard, the dark, brooding shadow of his face. He freezes for a moment, torn between his old loyalties, his fresh hurt, and the unhelpful urge to make a joke about Steve coming full circle with the new Brooklyn hipster look. In the end, all he says is, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you invited us,\u201d says Steve. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d says Tony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat, then, where the two of them don\u2019t say anything at all. Tony wonders who, if anyone, will yield, or if there\u2019s anything left to be said at all. He is about to settle into the uncertainty of it, when \u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, hey, I don\u2019t know if you remember me? I\u2019m, um \u2026 \u201d Peter apparently loses his ability to speak, so aggressively extending his hand out for Steve to shake that he nearly trips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve blinks, and just like that, the tension seems to snap, if only for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQueens,\u201d says Steve in recognition, taking Peter\u2019s hand. His smile is worn, but genuine. Tony\u2019s only grateful for the kid\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony takes a step back to Peter is fully visible in the light. \u201cAnd this is his egg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter freezes, the egg still clutched protectively in his left hand. He turns to Tony, clearly embarrassed. \u201c<em> Dude </em>,\u201d he says quietly. .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I should ask,\u201d says Steve, who had evidently noticed on his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter waffles his weight between his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidnight snack,\u201d Tony prompts him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go put that in the fridge overnight, so you don\u2019t have to worry about Humpty Dumpty taking a great fall?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter tilts himself back toward the kitchen. \u201cThis is <em> not </em> how I imagined my first legitimate conversation with Captain America would go,\u201d he mutters as he heads back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to see you again, kid,\u201d calls Steve down the hall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too, Cap,\u201d says Peter miserably.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They wait until Peter is out of earshot \u2014 well, until Steve thinks Peter is out of earshot, at least, because Tony knows there\u2019s no way in hell the kid can\u2019t hear them from the kitchen \u2014 and Steve asks, \u201cIs he \u2026 part of the team now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony doesn\u2019t want to put any pressure on Peter by saying no, so he says, \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what the team is now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve nods. \u201cWell \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever we\u2019re doing, let\u2019s not do it now. It\u2019s late,\u201d says Tony, as if either of them actually sleep normal hours. \u201cI trust you remember your way around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Steve. He waits for a beat, then presses onward in the direct he was headed, toward where his room used to be at the end of the hall. It takes approximately one second after he closes the door for Peter to come bounding back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, <em> Captain America?</em>\u201d he says, ripping off his mask, his eyes so bright they look like someone put batteries in them. \u201cWho <em> else </em> is here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do roll call in the morning,\u201d says Tony. \u201cYour room\u2019s here. Get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter looks into the open door and his jaw falls open. \u201cYou could get lost in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, the rent\u2019s a bit cheaper upstate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bathroom\u2019s bigger than my <em> room!</em>\u201d says Peter, who has already dashed back from it and jumped on the bed to get a better view.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have an off button?\u201d asks Tony, watching Peter\u2019s eyes flit over the room so fast that even Tony\u2019s getting a little dizzy. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he says, heading back out into the hall, \u201cI\u2019d say don\u2019t let the bedbugs bite, but \u2026 well. Too late for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leaves before the kid can see the <em> Star Wars </em> poster hung over the bed, because honestly, he is nowhere near caffeinated enough to handle that kind of excitement right now. Nor is he caffeinated enough when he strolls into the kitchen the next morning to find a tense gathering of Steve, Sam, Clint and Natasha at the table, eating in relative silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, this is \u2026 homey,\u201d says Tony, already dreading the talks they were going to have to have later today.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha nods to the space behind him. \u201cMorning, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony turns around, and in that moment discovers two things: Peter Parker is not a morning person, and he is also very, very bad at keeping his own secrets. (Okay, so he already knew about that second one; his eardrums were still scarred from the hour long phone call and subsequent two hour in-person meeting with Peter\u2019s aunt.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Nata \u2014 oh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes are comically wide, his cheek still red with indentations from his pillow, his hair so messy that it seems to have grown several inches overnight. He\u2019s wearing a spare Stark Industries shirt and jeans that someone with more wherewithal than Tony must have left in the room for him, and is decidedly not in the suit he\u2019d planned on wearing in front of everyone else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Clint asks. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u201d Peter looks at Tony and then back at them, a little helplessly. \u201cPeter,\u201d he mumbles eventually. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what exactly are you doing here?\u201d asks Sam.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s an intern,\u201d says Tony, flashing Peter a look \u2014 <em> you\u2019re on your own </em>. It\u2019s not like the kid wasn\u2019t warned upside down and backwards about the other guests.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clint frowns, looking at Peter suspiciously. \u201cAnd he spent the night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aaaand not on his own anymore. \u201cCat\u2019s out of the bag now, kid. Just tell \u2018em,\u201d says Tony, reaching into the fridge to grab the milk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me you don\u2019t have secret kids, too,\u201d says Clint to Tony. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter splutters. To be fair, even Tony\u2019s a little bit startled by the assumption, so much so that he doesn\u2019t say anything and accidentally leaves the kid hanging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 well, I \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The realization dawns on Steve\u2019s face then. He muffles his mouth to keep from laughing, but it\u2019s too late. \u201cOh, my god. <em> You\u2019re </em> Spider-Man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s eyebrows shoot up almost violently. \u201cNo. That right there is a child, is what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha smirks. \u201cSorry, tough guy,\u201d she tells Peter, as his face gets steadily redder and redder. \u201cThey were going to find out eventually.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clint balks. \u201c<em> You </em> knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sam isn\u2019t done. \u201cSo we\u2019re letting Backyardigans on the team now? That\u2019s how this is gonna go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony raises a hand up. \u201cLeave the kid be,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t have him crying in homeroom after Happy drops him off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cHomeroom?</em>\u201d Sam repeats. \u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFifteen,\u201d says Tony, before Peter can open his mouth to lie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d says Clint. And then: \u201cOh my god. You let us kick some kid\u2019s ass in Germany?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Peter protests.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive him <em> some </em> credit,\u201d says Natasha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Steve, polishing off the last of his breakfast. \u201cHe\u2019s not bad, for a punk from Queens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna \u2026 grab some food, and \u2026 find a place to go die of embarrassment,\u201d says Peter, shoving his face into the fridge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve gets up from the table, clearing his plate by hand the way he always does despite the ridiculous amount of technology at his disposal. Only Tony notices when Peter opens the fridge, stares at Steve scraping his the dregs of his omelet off his plate, and freezes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it, kid?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Peter squeaks, with horror written all over his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve nods his goodbye to everyone and leaves the kitchen, and the conversation picks back up again on the other side of the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why do you look like you just had a \u2018nam flashback?\u201d Tony asks. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Peter finally turns to him, he looks like he might faint.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCaptain America ate my baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The words are delivered so lowly and with such palpable devastation that it takes Tony a few seconds to even register them \u2014 unfortunately, those few seconds do nothing to help him compose himself when he doubles over, laughing so sharply that everyone at the kitchen table looks up in alarm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d says Peter, his voice nearly another octave higher than usual. \u201cI\u2019m going to <em> fail sex ed</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, relax, kid, we\u2019ll find another one,\u201d says Tony, leaving the kitchen and motioning for Peter to follow so the rest of the team doesn\u2019t have to witness a pubescent freakout. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t!\u201d he says, panicking. \u201cThat one was stamped at the bottom! Leeds-Parker! Also I was strangely emotionally attached to it and now I feel like this failure is probably going to hang over my head for the rest of my life oh my <em> god </em> I can\u2019t even take care of an <em> egg </em> how am I going to figure out what a mortgage is \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, slow your roll. It\u2019s an <em> egg</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an egg, Mr. Stark, it\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d says Peter somberly, his eyes trained on Tony\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m doomed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony puts his hands on Peter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI feel that I must inform you that you are being extremely dramatic right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter swallows, hard. \u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll just. Um. Calmly explain to our teacher \u2026 that a national war hero ate my homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony sighs. \u201cDo you have a picture of the stamp?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Peter miserably. He pulls his phone out of his pocket, revealing an obscene number of pictures of the egg on his camera roll \u2014 the egg with googly eyes, the egg in a cape, the egg posed on top of a massive LEGO Death Star.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the bad news is that your actual future kids are going to get shoved into lockers in junior high. The good news is I\u2019m 100 percent certain that somewhere in this top of the line multimillion dollar facility we have the technology to recreate that stamp on a different egg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of the hope returns back to Peter\u2019s eyes again. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d says Tony drily, taking the phone from Peter to take it to the printer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter lets out a breath of relief reminiscent of a man who just got cleared from death row. \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark,\u201d he says. He follows him a few paces, half-jogging to keep up, and says, \u201cAnd, uh, sorry for freaking out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now you know how I feel when you get \u2026 scrambled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter blinks, and then looks so momentarily disarmed by the sentiment that Tony almost regrets saying it. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFried. Over easy. The works,\u201d says Tony, trying to take some of the weight of what he just said off both of their shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t say anything as they walk down the hall, and for a moment Tony thinks that he won\u2019t say anything at all. Then, with a solemnity Tony isn\u2019t prepared for, he says, \u201cThanks for looking out for me, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony shifts his gaze toward the window. He tries to think of something to cut through this unexpected heaviness, something that will distract from that ever present worry that beats in his head like a drum: that there are some things that he can't look out for. Some things he'll never be able to protect Peter from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But today is simple. Today is quick-dry cement and teenage embarrassment and a broken egg. So today Tony looks at him sideways and says, \"Of course.\" \u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter shows up to his first post-Avengers victory party with a backpack full of pajamas and textbooks, a slightly wilted looking fruit and cheese plate, and a grin so badly suppressed that Tony\u2019s worried it might break his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I late? Did the party start yet? Where should I put \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, you\u2019re 45 minutes early. Vision hasn\u2019t even fixed his hair yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shoot. My bad,\u201d says Peter, walking past Tony with that same slightly awed expression he has whenever he visits HQ.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can stick that \u2026 literally anywhere,\u201d says Tony, referencing the platter that his aunt no doubt sent him with. \u201cWait. Pause. Are you limping?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. Just, uh, party swagger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, what happened out there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing that won\u2019t be fixed in the next 45 minutes!\u201d calls Peter, bounding down the hall toward the rec room like the impertinent teenager he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony sighs. He was reluctant to even have this \u2026 party, or whatever it is they\u2019re calling it, in the first place \u2014\u00a0and even more reluctant to invite Peter. Not that the kid is unwelcome, but it seems a little counterintuitive, inviting him to a party to celebrate the victory of a battle he was <em> expressly </em> forbidden from joining. Tony has no experience in actually raising a teenager, but he\u2019s 98 percent certain you\u2019re not supposed to reward them for, say, nosediving into a battle of killer robots without a comm, and during a midterm exam, no less.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the Peter factor aside, there\u2019s an undeniable awkwardness to this whole thing. This morning was the first time the fractured team\u00a0really had to work together as a unit since \u2014\u00a0well, since before the Accords blew up in their faces. And they did it with surprising ease. All of the tense hours they\u2019d spent in and out of the training rooms in the last few weeks had culminated into something not just worth salvaging, but maybe something that had never quite gone away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And like it or not, Tony knows Peter plays a part in that. The kid was never truly on anyone\u2019s <em> side</em>, so he\u2019s been weirdly instrumental in freezing some of the ice between everyone \u2014\u00a0and if there\u2019s one thing all the Avengers and non-Avengers and possible war criminals can agree on, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve all got a soft spot for their underage arachnid friend. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony sighs. As it turned out, they\u2019d needed him today. Badly. Clint missed it, but Peter spared him from a hit that would have \u2014\u00a0well, Tony prefers not to think about it. And he got more than a few dozen civilians out of the line of fire from OsCorp\u2019s rogue drones. (Tony\u2019s not going to lie; it\u2019s nice that some <em> other </em> multibillion dollar company is going to have to deal with the fallout from that PR nightmare for once.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s not sure, though, if Peter\u2019s brand of semi-suicidal heroics and naive teenage banter will be enough to actually make this party feel like it isn\u2019t a reenactment of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Little does Tony know that by the end of the night, that will be the <em> least </em> of his concerns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be fair, though, the \u201cparty\u201d starts so tamely that Tony almost resents it. He follows Peter to the rec room to find him scribbling chicken scratch and numbers into a notebook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, I thought you were coming in here to watch cartoons or make an adult feel like a crone. What is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLinear algebra,\u201d says Peter. \u201cI have a test tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so <em> now </em> you\u2019re taking your studies seriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter looks up from the open textbook perched on the couch. \u201cI think killer robots beat high school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is your education, not a game of rock, paper, scissors,\u201d Tony grouses. \u201cIn any case, don\u2019t think I\u2019ve let you off the hook for today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong answer. Think of a better one by tomorrow, because I\u2019m saving the lecture for then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCool,\u201d says Peter, nodding, \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow Tony sincerely doubts that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Within an hour, the group has convened down in the space Tony uses for entertaining. Everything\u2019s all set up \u2014 open bar, pool table, darts, and a hot food bar that Peter diligently retrieved and propped his fruit and cheese plate on, much to the amusement of the team. The floor is so packed with people that it starts to feel like old times; at least, it does if Tony\u00a0ignores the weird ache in his chest and squints.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony slips back into host mode with surprising ease, but there\u2019s not much to be done. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. He has every intention of keeping an eye on Peter, but there are enough eyes on Peter in the room that he figures he doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI come bearing drinks,\u201d says Sam at one point, after a walk to the bar. \u201cBeer for Clint, whiskey for Nat, vodka for Wanda, and juice for Hannah Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d says Peter, taking the lemonade from Sam\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA toast,\u201d says Clint, raising their glasses. \u201cTo successfully having already navigated puberty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter groans and Natasha noogies him, messing up his hair. Still, he takes a begrudging drink, his lips puckering. \u201cThis is <em> sour.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe found his weakness,\u201d Steve quips, walking over. \u201cTurns out kids from Queens can\u2019t handle sour lemonade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes and takes another exaggeratedly long sip, pulling another face. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Tony hadn\u2019t been distracted by a call from Pepper at that moment, he might have recognized that this was the first moment in a series of many moments that he would kick himself for later, when he\u2019d realize that they all low key committed a criminal offense. But Pepper calls, and Tony leaves, and everything is set in terminal, cacophonous motion after that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time Tony comes back, there\u2019s a cluster of them hollering around what appears to be Peter jumping up and down and psyching himself up as Thor smirks at the table across from him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat on god\u2019s green Midgard is going on over here?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter has challenged Thor to an arm wrestling match,\u201d Vision reports.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony scowls at the gathered crowd. \u201cYou guys know we have cable television here, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you prepared to meet your match, young arachnid?\u201d Thor booms over the sound of everyone\u2019s antics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Peter, hopping between his feet. \u201cYeah, bring it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He props his elbow on the table, and Thor claps a hand into his.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Spidey!\u201d Wanda yells.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCrush him like a bug, Thor!\u201d Sam yells louder. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow Clint has become the referee. \u201cOn my mark. Three \u2026 two \u2026 one \u2026 <em> go</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter immediately and visibly strains his arm against Thor\u2019s, his face flushing with embarrassing speed. Thor yawns theatrically, inciting a few cackles from the audience. Then, seemingly against all odds, Peter gets just enough of an advantage that Thor\u2019s arm creaks backward just enough that there\u2019s an audible gasp in the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> BOOM</em>. Thor reacts by slamming Peter\u2019s hand down on the table so fast that the kid yelps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sam whoops and Thor beats his chest victoriously. Peter stares down at his hand and looks up into the middle ground like a warn torn soldier and says, \u201cI think my life just flashed before my eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d asks Natasha sympathetically, patting him on the back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes find hers, his voice cracking. \u201cReally, <em> really </em> nerdy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Thor does a rather ostentatious victory lap around the room, nearly knocking into a row of glasses, Tony calls after him, \u201cTry not to break anything. Priceless art. Glasses. Overly talkative teenage vigilantes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter bounces off before Tony can say anything to him, but that\u2019s hardly the end of his reckless streak for the night. Tony chalks it up to bluster and teenage hormones and the fact that the kid gets about 80 percent more hyper whenever he leaves the border of Queens, but throughout the course of the night, as Peter aggressively establishes himself as The Life Of The Party, Tony can\u2019t help but wonder if <em> something </em> is up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A half hour later, for instance, he finds the kid\u2019s sneakers lined up against the couch. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to connect the dots and look up, where Tony sees that the kid is hanging upside down from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs anybody else reliving the \u201880s right now?\u201d Tony mutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cClint bet me ten dollars I couldn\u2019t drink water upside down!\u201d says Peter, his face slightly red either from the excitement or the blood rushing to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, is your allowance <em> that </em> bad? How about I give you twenty to sit on the couch like a normal person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha pulls Tony away then for a game of pool. He\u2019s wincing from a particularly badly aimed shot when Natasha nudges him, and points halfway across the room with a smirk. Wanda, clearly a little tipsy and uncharacteristically loud, says, \u201cOh, come on, Peter, don\u2019t be a coward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait wait wait,\u201d says Peter, one hand wrapped around his lemonade glass and the other reaching into the air, where Wanda is holding \u2014 no, levitating \u2014 his phone over her head. \u201cI already accidentally liked one of her Instagrams from, like, <em> March </em> a few minutes ago. It\u2019s social suicide. I can\u2019t <em> text </em> her \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you so scared of?\u201d Wanda taunts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter pauses for a moment. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask that if you knew MJ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen tell me about her,\u201d says Wanda. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter stammers for a moment. \u201cI \u2014\u00a0I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, \u201cshe\u2019s \u2014\u00a0she\u2019s smart and mean and beautiful and kind of scary and basically the best person you\u2019ll ever meet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d says Wanda, levitating the phone back down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter extends his hand out in relief to take it from her. Wanda smirks devilishly and leans her mouth into the phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSend audio recording.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter blanches. \u201cS-send audio recording?\u201d he asks. \u201cRecording of <em> what?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wanda blows him a kiss, plopping the phone back in his hand and dashing off. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, little spider.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter chases after her then, saying, \u201cWait, you have to help with the damage control! <em> Wanda!</em>\u201d And then, mercifully, the two of them are out of earshot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, young love,\u201d says Natasha wryly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs a crick out of his neck, eyeing the disaster that he just created on the pool table. \u201cEvery time I talk to that kid I somehow manage to miss that year I spent in high school even less.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s nice having him around. You know? He\u2019s \u2026\u201d She gestures over to the corner, where Peter and Steve and Thor are laughing over something, the phone already long forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Tony, a little jarred by all the smiling he sees in the room. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>From there, though, Peter\u2019s shenanigans only seem to escalate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what would be <em> sick?</em>\u201d he overhears Peter telling an attentive but confused looking Vision. \u201cA pet dinosaur. Not, like, a big one, just like, a microraptor or something. I mean, I live in Queens, though, so the apartment\u2019s kind of too small \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After Tony comes back from a trip to the hot food bar, he overhears yet another gem.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called <em> Pokemon \u2014 </em> wait, wait, but \u2014\u00a0if I tell you about it, you can\u2019t tell Sam, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, I\u2019m one of the most highly trained spies on the planet. I think I can keep your little video game a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Okay. I\u2019m trusting you, Nat. It\u2019s called <em> Pokemon Go</em>, and you kind of just \u2026 well like \u2026 see, there\u2019s a Clefairy in the compound! Whoa! I wonder if there\u2019s a <em> nest </em> in here! Anyway, you can kind of aim it to catch it? See, like right now, it\u2019s chilling on Thor\u2019s butt \u2014\u00a0and you just sort of swipe it, and \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we <em> please </em> keep it PG over here?\u201d asks Tony, looking over Peter\u2019s shoulder at the phone in alarm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCaught it!\u201d says Peter, ignoring him completely. \u201cOh man, I never get high level ones on the first try anymore, that was awesome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honestly, though, even though all signs point to exactly what is happening like a goddamn neon light flashing over the kid\u2019s head, Tony doesn\u2019t manage to make all the pieces make sense until it\u2019s nearly midnight. By then the party is starting to wind down, a quiet, mellow vibe taking over the floor as people start to yawn and start glancing up at the rooms upstairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, Captain Rogers?\u201d he hears Peter saying animatedly by the couches in the center of the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, kid?\u201d asks Steve, an amused grin already on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyebrows are <em> super </em> symmetrical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Never one to make anybody feel stupid, Steve offers him a somewhat puzzled, \u201cThanks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d think that they\u2019d have frozen off or something, after all that time in the ice? But \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHold up,\u201d says Tony, standing in between the two of them. Peter startles a bit at the sight of Tony flooding his vision, and lets out an audible gasp when Tony puts his hand under his chin and holds it there, tiling his face up. \u201cLook at me, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter blinks at him. \u201cUm,\u201d he says, his brow furrowing slightly, \u201cyour eyebrows are cool, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony narrows his eyes at the kid, at his glossy, unfocused expression and the way he seems to be swaying slightly on his feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em> drunk?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asks Peter, shaking his head so violently he nearly knocks himself over. \u201cWhat, no, I \u2014\u00a0I\u2019ve been drinking lemonade all night!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony takes the cup from Peter\u2019s hand, sniffs it, and takes a swig.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dear god,\u201d says Tony, the alcohol so sharp on his tongue that he feels like he just got knocked into a frat house. \u201cKid, how many of these did you <em> have?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many lemonades?\u201d Peter asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know? Sive or fix?\u201d His eyes widen. \u201cFive or six,\u201d he corrects himself. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony sets the glass down on the counter so hard it nearly spills over. \u201cThere\u2019s enough alcohol in here to ruin a prom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Peter asks. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre <em> you </em> kidding?\" Tony counters. \"How did you not realize that you were getting <em> tanked?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2014I\u2019ve never had alcohol before! I thought it was just weird tasting lemonade!\u201d says Peter, looking so earnestly guilty that Tony reminds himself to take a beat. Of course, that beat comes a bit too late, because by now the entire room has gone silent and is staring straight at them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d says Tony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cErm,\u201d says Clint guiltily. \u201cDid you get that from the cooler under the bar? Because I put a <em> ton </em> of vodka in it earlier in the night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony pinches the space between his eyes with his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s been <em> hours</em>. Why didn\u2019t someone <em> say </em> something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thor is the first to respond, scowling at Tony. \u201cAre all Midgardian warriors not entitled to partake in the revels of victory?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony rolls his eyes. \u201cAnyone <em> else?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark, I \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had no idea there was any alcohol in it,\u201d says Steve, holding his hands up in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t metabolize it, I\u2019ve been drinking it all night!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wanda is cackling, but says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Natasha lets out a little scoff. \u201cI knew. Thought the kid did, too. Can\u2019t he have a little fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sam clears his throat, accidentally leading everyone\u2019s eyes straight to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d he says. \u201cI only gave him the first one because I thought it would be funny. I didn\u2019t think people were gonna go around refilling it for him all night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019ll deal with you lot later,\u201d says Tony, whipping around to face his very intoxicated charge. \u201cIt\u2019s your bedtime. Tell everyone goodnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, come on, Tony!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lame</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI fail to see the fault in the young spider warrior's actions \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, man, it\u2019s not the pipsqueak\u2019s fault \u2014\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Enough</em>. Regardless of the complete disregard for the law and the welfare of a minor you\u2019ve all had, it\u2019s a school night. He\u2019s going to bed. So long, farewell, auf wiedersen, good night,\u201d says Tony, corralling Peter toward the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if the kid\u2019s going to bed, party\u2019s over,\u201d says Clint with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wanda shrugs. \u201cRegrettable, but true,\u201d she says, following him toward the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Sam, \u201cif Dora the Explorer's headed out, so am I.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even Thor sighs, tilting himself toward the stairs and saying, \u201cI bid you all a good night, comrades.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, dude,\u201d Peter pipes up. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your hammer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Peter, in all of his drunken, ridiculous, 15-year-old glory, leans down and picks up Mj\u00f6lnir from the floor and extends it out to Thor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment it is so quiet that nobody in the room seems to breathe. And then, so lowly that Tony barely hears it, Clint says, \u201cWell, <em> shit</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It only takes one look at Thor\u2019s face for Tony's anger to completely evaporate as he loses his shit, and just like that they\u2019re all laughing loud enough to do permanent damage to each other\u2019s eardrums. Tony nearly doubles over, his rib cage pressing in on itself with the utter absurdity of the image of Peter, holding the hammer with his unique brand of cluelessness, and Thor, a full-grown demigod who's looking at a kid a third of\u00a0his size\u00a0like he\u00a0just beat him up on the playground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a beat, but then Peter starts laughing with them, looking a little shaken by their reaction but not at all questioning of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHammer is such a weird word,\u201d he says, entirely missing the point. \u201c<em>Hammer. </em> Haha. Oh, god,\u201d he says, putting down Mj\u00f6lnir, his face suddenly going slack. \u201c<em>I\u2019m </em> hammered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you are,\u201d says Tony. \u201cC\u2019mon, kid \u2026 let\u2019s call it a night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He claps Peter on the shoulder and guides him over to the stairs, where, to his credit, Peter only manages to trip once. There are mixed cheers and whoops and a \u201cGet it, Spidey!\u201d as he departs, and Peter turns around and does a clumsy little half-bow before tripping <em> again</em>, making Tony responsible for yanking him up by the elbow before he face plants down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only after they round the corner and everyone else is out of sight does the magnitude of the drunkenness seem to dawn on Peter. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he says, his eyes wide on Tony\u2019s. \u201cAm I gonna go to jail?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but the rest of us\u00a0might.\u201d He cocks his head toward the toward Peter\u2019s quarters. \u201cBed. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait \u2014 but how can you get \u2026 un-drunk? How do I fix it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBy pretending this never happened and never, ever speaking about this again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter follows him dutifully to the open door to his room, where his backpack is strewn out on the bed, spilling over with textbooks, old junk food wrappers, and the sleeve of what appear to be Iron Man pajamas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em> no</em>, Aunt May,\u201d he breathes. \u201c<em>Why?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe has good taste. Now get some sleep and pray that your healing factor extends to hangovers. Otherwise tomorrow is <em> not </em> going to be pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s heading out the door when the sound of Peter\u2019s quiet voice stalls him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Stark,\u201d he says, the sincerity of it cutting through the dim light of the room. \u201cI <em> swear </em> I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony stops, holding in a sigh. He turns around to look at Peter. \u201cI know, kid. I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter opens his mouth to say something more, and then seems to lose the thought in the breath he takes. Tony waits. He knows what\u2019s coming before Peter does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry about not listening,\u201d says Peter, his eyes unexpectedly rimmed with a redness that wasn\u2019t there even moments earlier. \u201cBefore, I mean. With the \u2014 with the robots and stuff.\u201d He takes a shaky breath, trying to master himself, and says, \"I just \u2026 it\u2019s hard, because I don\u2019t want to let you down, I really don\u2019t, but I can\u2019t just be there and not <em> be </em> there, you know? I can\u2019t just \u2014 when I can help, and I can\u2019t help, I just \u2014 I can\u2019t do that, Mr. Stark. I can\u2019t not help. And I\u2019m always going to be like that. And I\u2019m <em> sorry</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony crosses the room to him and puts his hands on the kid's shoulders, steadying him. Then he says, \"Kid, if you're only going to remember one thing about this night when you wake up dry heaving like a college freshman tomorrow morning, remember this.\" He searches Peter's eyes, those wide, absurdly trusting eyes that Tony knows have been watching him for a lot longer than he has even been aware. \"You could\u00a0<em>never</em> let me down. <em>Ever</em>. You understand?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter doesn't say anything, a helpless expression on his face that Tony hasn't seen before. And then, for the slightest beat, something deeper \u2014 Tony looks at him and sees demons that are all too familiar to him, brewing in the eyes of someone far too young to contend with them. The eyes of someone who has lost far too much, far too soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I think the idea of fate is stupid, kid. I really do. I think people who believe in it are even stupider.\" He pats Peter on the shoulder one more time before taking a step back, and looking him in the eye. \"But I think this \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 it happened to you for a reason. I think it chose you. And I know I can't ask you to turn your back on that, even if it scares the hell out of me every other damn day.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter nods then, with a solemnity that makes him look much older than his fifteen years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Now get some sleep and pass that math test tomorrow. We've\u00a0got a world to save.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter cracks a smile at him then, and Tony is reminded yet again at just how little it takes to put the kid's world back into orbit, just how much he internalizes every little\u00a0thing that Tony says. He leaves the room with an inexplicable ache in his chest, knowing that there will be no more lectures, no more banning from battles. He knows he might not be able to live with himself for letting Peter get involved, but he finally understands \u2014 he'd rather bear that burden than have the kid live with the burden of not being able to help, when he is more determined to than anyone Tony has ever met.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Hey, Aunt May, it\u2019s me. Camp is good. Lots of trees. I\u2019m making friends \u2014 uh, there\u2019s Rob, and Harriet, and a guy named Anthony that we just call Tony. Um, I miss you. Try not to burn down the apartment while I\u2019m gone.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It takes them three days to figure out something is wrong.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Hey, Aunt May. Me again. Today we went on a hike. I learned some really corny camp jokes. Like what do you call Tony the Tiger when he runs a copy machine? A copy cat. Yeah, I know, it\u2019s lame. Hope work is good. Miss you.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter gets a scholarship to go to a week-long summer camp upstate. A hybrid camp for science and nature. \u201cTell the team I\u2019m going somewhere super badass,\u201d says Peter, \u201clike \u2014 uh \u2014 backpacking, or something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDisneyland it is,\u201d says Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He looks into the camp. It seems impressive. Peter worries about being gone for a full week, but Tony tells him not to sweat it, they can keep the world from imploding long enough for him to go squint at butterflies and make friends with some other age-appropriate nerds. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Hey Aunt May. Long day at camp. We told ghost stories by the fire. Some kid said he had a full conversation with the ghost of Alexander Hamilton. I tried to call Tony a liar, but he wasn\u2019t having it \u2026 Anyway \u2014 um \u2014 I miss you. I love you. Bye. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s the way Peter says \u201cI love you\u201d that stirs something in May; the way he says \u201cI love you\u201d that makes her call the camp and demand to talk to Peter, only to be told that they received her letter saying Peter had to drop out for a family emergency, and that he had never arrived. It only takes a few moments for her to loop Tony in, forwarding him every voicemail Peter left on her phone while she was at work over the past three days. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony doesn\u2019t even get far enough into the messages to hear the \u201cI love you\u201d. What he hears is the thread all of the messages have in common, the two repeated words Peter had been so desperately trying to convey: </span>\n<em>\n<span>Call Tony. Call Tony. Call Tony. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The words thrum into him like a second heartbeat, growing louder and angrier with each passing second. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Somebody has their kid. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s first instinct is to go out on his own \u2014 find whatever security footage he can and tear the goddamn city apart if he has to. But he can be reckless like that when it\u2019s his own life on the line \u2014 he can\u2019t afford it with Peter\u2019s. Within minutes he has everyone on the compound assembled, Natasha pulling up street footage using Tony\u2019s facial recognition technology, Sam sending out heat-seeking drones, Clint trying to backtrack the number from the \u201ccamp phone\u201d that Peter\u2019s been using to call his aunt. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dead ends. All of them. Someone was one step ahead of them, and all the security cameras from Peter\u2019s street were wiped out on the day he left for camp. The only thing it suggests is that whoever got to him did it early, and did it in his neighborhood \u2014 Peter never even made it on the bus. But where he ended up after that is anybody\u2019s guess. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>May doesn\u2019t go to work the next day, insisting on staying in the apartment in case Peter somehow makes it home; they send Natasha to try and trace the call when it\u2019s supposed to come on the fourth day, but it doesn\u2019t. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony doesn\u2019t think time has ever moved more slowly or more agonizingly in his life. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The entire compound is thick with collective panic \u2014 Tony doesn\u2019t see a single person sleep a wink that first night or into the next day. By chance Natasha finds a YouTube video of some kids doing stunts on Peter\u2019s street the day he went missing; they scan the license plate of every single car that is visible on the street in the time window, dozens and dozens of them, looking into the backgrounds of their owners until \u2014 </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop,\u201d says Tony. \u201cPull this guy up.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It doesn\u2019t matter; he already knows they\u2019ve got the right hit. The word </span>\n<em>\n<span>OsCorp</span>\n</em>\n<span> burns like a brand in Tony\u2019s eyes. Apparently the man had been working for the company for ten years, and was abruptly let go nine months prior. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The same month Peter went on a field trip, and was bitten by a rogue spider that had escaped from its habitat. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGet me a facial recognition scan on this guy everywhere in the country. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Now</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They have a lock on him within minutes, walking into a convenience store in Queens only two hours earlier. They manage to scrap enough footage together to trace him back to the entrance of a warehouse. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony, </span>\n<em>\n<span>wait</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t even know who said it \u2014 he\u2019s in the sky and yelling coordinates to Natasha without looking back. It takes ten long minutes that seem like an eternity to find the warehouse; as it comes into view Tony is unwittingly remembering those spikes in the kid\u2019s heartbeat, the footage of Toomes dropping that building on him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha\u2019s motorbike is outside of the building; she was already in Queens and must have beat him here. He all but blasts through the open door behind her \u2014 the first thing he sees is the former OsCorp employee, on the ground, undeniably dead. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s heart seizes. Natasha wouldn\u2019t kill someone they needed information from. Not unless she had a </span>\n<em>\n<span>damn</span>\n</em>\n<span> good reason to, and Tony is suddenly terrified to know what that reason could be. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNatasha \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShhhh,\u201d he hears her saying. It\u2019s coming from the back corner. \u201cShhh, I\u2019m going to get you out of here, okay?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony freezes, as if he can blink away the image through the viewfinder of his mask. The kid is propped in the corner, his wrists and ankles shackled, his body slack like a rag doll. The screen zeroes in on him before Tony can even fully feel the impact of it, magnifying every gash and bruise from the fresh to the barely healed, picking up on a sick pattern of what appear to be round holes in both of Peter\u2019s upper arms. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he\u2019s breathing, and his eyes are open. Bloodshot, listless, and heavy-lidded, but open. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not here,\u201d Peter says thickly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am,\u201d says Natasha, fiddling with the restraints with a tool from her belt. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take you back home and fix you up. Tony, don\u2019t move,\u201d she says, using the same soothing voice without missing a beat \u2014 she doesn\u2019t even have to turn around to see that he has poised the thin blasters on his suit and targeted the shackles because he just wants to </span>\n<em>\n<span>get the kid out of there</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he can\u2019t even </span>\n<em>\n<span>think</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare him.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span> that, they\u2019re way past scared, they\u2019re at fucking </span>\n<em>\n<span>terrified</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Tony disengages the suit, practically stumbling the last few feet over to them and onto his knees at Peter\u2019s side. Peter sees him there and closes his eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t real,\u201d Peter murmurs, with the practice of someone who has said it many times before. \u201cYou\u2019re not here, you\u2019re not \u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s hallucinating,\u201d says Natasha. \u201cThese marks in his skin \u2026 I\u2019ve seen them before.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony opens his mouth to say something, but for a moment his throat is too tight. \u201cNo, kid, we\u2019re here.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKeep talking to him. I\u2019ve almost got him out.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he doesn\u2019t know what to say except </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m sorry.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter, could you keep your eyes open for us?\u201d prompts Natasha, when Tony is still at a loss. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first shackle finally comes loose, and Peter flinches, his wrist raw from struggling against it. He opens his eyes and lifts his arm, looking at his hand like he can\u2019t quite believe it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna come back,\u201d says Peter. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d says Tony, trying and failing to keep the edge out of his voice. \u201cI promise you, he\u2019s not.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only then do Peter\u2019s eyes snap onto his, only then does he see the recognition finally creeping into them \u2014 and then, just as swiftly, the shame. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit,\u201d Peter mutters, resting his head back against the wall. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve called for med evac,\u201d murmurs a voice behind them, and only then does Tony realize Sam was tailing him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha clicks another one of Peter\u2019s arms free, and the kid starts to shake. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, hey, almost out,\u201d she says to him. \u201cTwo more to go.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter nods sluggishly. \u201cTh-thanks,\u201d he says, trying to prop his head up again to look as Natasha moves onto his legs. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Some gear finally snaps back into place for Tony then, and he puts a hand on the kid\u2019s forehead, easing him back down. He looks up at Tony, and something in Tony\u2019s expression must scare him a little, because his eyes widen a bit in response. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cM-Mr. Stark?\u201d he says. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, kid.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter makes the slightest grimace that, if he weren\u2019t covered in blood and muck and god knows what else, might have looked like a smile. \u201cDisneyland was </span>\n<em>\n<span>shit</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony knows what the kid\u2019s doing, only because he\u2019s done it a thousand times himself. Trying to crack a joke. Trying to ease the tension. Trying to minimize his own agony for the sake of everyone else around him. And maybe if Tony didn\u2019t know the kid so well, he\u2019d be able to do him the favor of laughing, of letting him to just that. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But this is </span>\n<em>\n<span>Peter</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and he </span>\n<em>\n<span>can\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span>. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The final shackle comes off then, and Tony moves to scoop him up from the floor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d says Natasha. \u201cThe capsules \u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter\u2019s eyes are sliding shut again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Kid</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha grabs Tony by the arm and says into his ear, \u201cThose marks on him \u2014 he installed capsules into him to administer injections. They\u2019re still inside his arms. We can\u2019t pull them out here, and we can\u2019t move him too much, or we might set them off. He could OD.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat </span>\n<em>\n<span>can</span>\n</em>\n<span> we do?\u201d Tony hisses. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha\u2019s eyes are firm on his. \u201cWe can wait for someone equipped to \u2014 </span>\n<em>\n<span>shit</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Evidently one of the devices has set itself off, and god only knows what is in it, because Peter\u2019s entire body starts to seize. It happens so fast that they don\u2019t even reach him by the time it stops \u2014 and then, horrifyingly, the kid goes completely slack, his eyes still open but unseeing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter,\u201d says Tony, louder than he means to. He puts a hand on the kid\u2019s face \u2014 </span>\n<em>\n<span>don\u2019t move him, don\u2019t move him, fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cPeter, can you hear me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The kid sucks in a breath that might be acknowledgement and might not be, but it\u2019s proof that he\u2019s still with them, and for one moment it\u2019s enough. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m gonna need you to stay still, kid.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter nods into his hand. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you \u2014 did someone \u2026\u201d He bites his lip like he can\u2019t decide whether to say it or not. \u201cAunt May,\u201d he says, his voice finally cracking. . </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, kid. I\u2019ll call her right now.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter doesn\u2019t answer, his eyes sliding shut again, a single tear leaking from them slipping down his cheek. He\u2019s out cold, but Tony can hear the chopper landing outside. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSir,\u201d someone says, ushering Tony out of the way. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, finally letting go of Peter \u2014 there was something he was supposed to do \u2014 call May, he remembers, and then \u2014 </span>\n<em>\n<span>call Tony, call Tony, call Tony</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u2026 </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>For three days Peter\u2019s been down here, enduring god only knows what, just </span>\n<em>\n<span>waiting</span>\n</em>\n<span> for Tony to find him. And Tony let him down. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The call to his aunt is excruciating; he somehow manages to keep his voice level and calm as he explains to her what\u2019s happening and where they\u2019re taking Peter and that someone is coming to collect her and take her upstate. Then he hangs up the phone and his eyes find Natasha\u2019s and he lets out this painful huff of a breath that he\u2019s been holding in, that he </span>\n<em>\n<span>has</span>\n</em>\n<span> to hold in, that he can\u2019t let himself think about \u2014 </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat fucker was going to kill him,\u201d says Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha glances over at the corpse. \u201cYeah, well. We got him first.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the hell is all this?\u201d Sam murmurs, walking toward the abandoned tech a few feet away. He presses a button, and before anyone is prepared for it, they can all </span>\n<span>hear the audio on it plain as day \u2014 </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d It\u2019s Peter\u2019s voice. He\u2019s crying. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Please</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTurn it off,\u201d says Tony instantly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sam is frantically pressing the buttons. \u201cI\u2019m trying, I \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou think I wouldn\u2019t figure out your little </span>\n<em>\n<span>plan?</span>\n</em>\n<span> Your stupid fucking secret </span>\n<em>\n<span>code?</span>\n</em>\n<span> I swear to god, if I see one fucking </span>\n<em>\n<span>Avenger</span>\n</em>\n<span> within thirty miles of this place, I\u2019ll head back to your apartment myself and blow that aunt of yours to \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Please</span>\n</em>\n<span>, no, I\u2019ll \u2014 I\u2019ll say anything you want, you can \u2014 the next time you call her, just tell me what to \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The words abruptly cut off by a scream; Tony doesn\u2019t mean to look, but it\u2019s just </span>\n<em>\n<span>there</span>\n</em>\n<span> on the screen, and he can see the electric shock pulsing through the shackles, coursing through the kid\u2019s body. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I still have tests to run,\u201d says the man, \u201cor you wouldn\u2019t have any </span>\n<em>\n<span>skin</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTurn it </span>\n<em>\n<span>off</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Tony yells. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha shoots the screen, and it goes silent. Without a word, she walks over to the smoking tech, pulls hard drive out of the computer, and stashes it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to want this when they\u2019re figuring out how to treat him,\u201d she says, with her usual authority. Still, Tony doesn\u2019t miss slightest crack in her expression, just before she turns her back on him and strides out toward the exit. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It takes five hours and a mountain of anesthesia to get the dispensers out of the kid\u2019s arms. Tony is watching and not watching, hovering on the edge of the window with his back turned, the same window May\u2019s eyes are glued on. For a little while other members of the team hover too, until May looks overwhelmed enough by the unexpected company that Pepper swoops in and ushers everybody out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d says May, as they\u2019re prepping to get the last one out. She has barely spoken more than the few words since they arrived, except to politely refuse anything that was offered to her. \u201cWhy would somebody </span>\n<em>\n<span>do</span>\n</em>\n<span> this to him?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony waits for a moment, trying to determine whether May is asking just to ask, or if she really wants an answer. Then her searching eyes find Tony\u2019s. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe man who had Peter \u2014 I suppose he was part of OsCorp's\u00a0bioengineering team. The spiders were a side project. Unauthorized. He was ordered to destroy them, and after one went unaccounted for, he was fired \u2026 the same day Peter\u2019s class went to OsCorp.\u201d Tony doesn\u2019t realize his fists are clenched until he feels the sting of nearly broken skin in his palms. \u201cHe probably knew that spider had something to do with Spider-Man from the beginning, but we have no idea how he traced it to Peter. Believe me, May, every effort has been made to keep that kid\u2019s identity under wraps.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d says May. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2014 this isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault but mine.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony shakes his head at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you do that. Shame spirals over the kid\u2019s well being are </span>\n<em>\n<span>my</span>\n</em>\n<span> thing.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>May watches, wincing, as they pull the last of the dispensers out with excruciating precision. \u201cIt\u2019s been my thing since he was dropped on the doorstep eight years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cJoin the club.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow are you feeling, kid?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter won\u2019t quite look at him from the hospital bed. Instead he tilts his head toward the morphine drip. \u201cLike someone spiked the lemonade again.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony tries to offer him a tight smile. He\u2019s surprised the kid is lucid enough to make jokes; disappointed that he feels like he has to. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI got your messages,\u201d says Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter stares across the bed at his feet. \u201cYeah. Some trick. Nobody\u2019s going to be recruiting me for SHIELD intel anytime soon.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, Peter. You did the right thing. That was a smart move.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSmart move?\u201d Peter echoes. He tries to hide the bitterness in his voice, but it doesn\u2019t quite work. The kid\u2019s too much of an open book. \u201cI got myself kidnapped.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey. You\u2019re not allowed to blame yourself for that,\u201d says Tony. \u201cThat was \u2014 that one\u2019s on all of us.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be \u2014 I fight with the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Avengers</span>\n</em>\n<span>. And some guy just \u2014 he just \u2014 \u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt happens to the best of us,\u201d says Tony, before the kid can go any further, before he can add anymore fuel to the humiliation he already sees burning in the kid\u2019s eyes. \u201cI mean it. Ask literally anyone on the team, we\u2019ve all been snatched, held hostage, the whole nine yards. Iron Man is only a </span>\n<em>\n<span>thing</span>\n</em>\n<span> because I got kidnapped. It\u2019s a goddamn rite of passage, really.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter winces, then tries unsuccessfully to turn it into a smirk. \u201cI would have preferred, like, prom.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Again with the jokes. \u201cKid.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter\u2019s eyes flash up toward his for just a moment, the expression on his face like a bruise. Then he lowers his eyes back down, the mask back on his face just as quickly as it left. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony can\u2019t even be mad. He knows exactly where the kid learned it from. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not going to make you tell me what happened,\u201d says Tony. What he doesn\u2019t say is, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Because I already know</span>\n</em>\n<span>. The footage is graphic and extensive, so much so that Tony has gone to great lengths to make sure neither May or Peter will ever be able to access it. \u201cBut you have to talk to someone. Your aunt. A professional. Me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter shakes his head, just once. \u201cI just \u2014 think it would be best if we never talked about it again.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony purses his lips. \u201cI wish it worked like that. We both know it doesn\u2019t.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s the closest they\u2019ve ever come to talking about his uncle; Tony doesn\u2019t have to have checked on Peter\u2019s files to know what happened. It was written up in a few local papers. Anyone with a search engine could find out Peter was there that night, when he was shot \u2014 anyone with a search engine knows Peter must have watched him die. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter\u2019s eyes are sliding shut again. Tony isn\u2019t surprised. He\u2019s been in and out all day seemingly at random, since he finally regained consciousness; the doctors said they don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last, but that his body is still trying to metabolize the toxins and it makes everything a little unpredictable. The first time he did it he stopped breathing on his own for a minute, so Tony is already on high alert, watching him steadily. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m still not even sure if this is real?\u201d says Peter, fighting against the current taking him. \u201cI keep thinking I\u2019m gonna wake back up, and \u00a0\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wants to be able to tell the kid that feeling goes away. Instead, he says, \u201cI know.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<span>After the drugs start filtering out of his system, Peter doesn\u2019t sleep for three days. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMust be some kind of after effect,\u201d says Peter dismissively, when May brings it up. \u201cI slept some while you were grabbing stuff from home.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony only hears because he happens to be standing outside the door. Peter knows better than to lie to Tony\u2019s face. Everyone else\u2019s, it seems, he doesn\u2019t have a problem with. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha\u2019s the first to visit him, aside from May and Tony \u2014\u00a0she doesn\u2019t wait for permission so much as she walks in behind Tony with her usual brand of quiet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou only look kind of terrible,\u201d she says, looking him up and down affectionately. \u201cGlad you\u2019re safe, kid.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter smirks. \u201cToo bad for you, though,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a little while there you got to be the best-looking spider in the compound\u00a0again.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha laughs, that subtle crease of worry relaxing in her face. \u201cCareful there, Tony. Kid\u2019s starting to sound just like you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen my work here is done.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s the same show every time one of the other team members comes to visit Peter; he\u2019s all snappy quips and wry jokes, deflecting questions with ease, smiling with such practice that it\u2019s almost easy to miss the purple under his eyes, the paleness of his skin. When Sam visits he and Peter spend a good half of an hour craned over the cracked screen of Peter\u2019s phone, watching crude rap remixes of Steve\u2019s high school PSAs. When Wanda comes in they prank call his friend Ned. When Steve busts in demanding to know why aforementioned raps are being broadcast in the downstairs gym, Peter merely answers, \u201cRevenge for my progeny,\u201d and refuses to elaborate as the rest of the team snickers behind his back.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They all come and go in waves, worried and cautious at first, all of them eventually falling for Peter\u2019s charming little charade. But Tony\u2019s the one who watches. Tony\u2019s the one who tells the doctor Peter hasn\u2019t been sleeping, and to fix him up with something that will conk him out. Tony\u2019s the one who deeply regrets it when he hears the scream in the middle of the night from down the hall, and finds Peter wide awake, sweating profusely, gasping for air.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKid. Peter,\u201d says Tony, flicking on the light. \u201cYou\u2019re at HQ. You\u2019re safe, you\u2019re \u2014\u00a0\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter\u2019s eyes find Tony\u2019s then, the panic settling into incomprehension and then, just as quickly, shame. He stares down at the blankets, still heaving, refusing to look at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony hesitates for a moment before putting a hand on the kid\u2019s shoulder. Peter flinches, but doesn\u2019t pull away. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust breathe,\u201d says Tony, feeling a little bit like a fraud when he says it. \u201cIt\u2019s over, kid. Wherever you think you are \u2014\u00a0\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to \u2014\u00a0I didn\u2019t mean to \u2014\u00a0how was I asleep?\u201d Peter asks. The words aren\u2019t accusatory, just genuinely stunned; it wouldn\u2019t even occur to the kid that anyone would do something to him behind his back. \u201cI just \u2014\u00a0I swear that I was \u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou clearly needed it,\u201d says Tony. \u201cYou might have everyone else in\u00a0this compound fooled, kid, but you haven\u2019t slept in days. You look like an extra on a low budget zombie movie.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter takes another rattling breath and seems to swallow it, whatever it is that\u2019s still clouding like a film over his eyes. He lets out another little wheeze that he tries to disguise as a laugh, nudging Tony\u2019s hand off his shoulder and saying, \u201cThe undead got sexy\u00a0again. In like, 2007. Look it up.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFor the love of all that is holy and unholy and in the gray area in between, can we quit it with the jokes, kid?\u201d says Tony. Before Peter can point out that Tony\u2019s doing it himself, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re not nearly old or jaded enough to pull it off, it\u2019s not a good look.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s afraid that he might have offended him, might have pushed it a little </span>\n<em>\n<span>too</span>\n</em>\n<span> far, but Peter hardly even reacts. Tony leans in, trying to compel Peter to look at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be \u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>tough</span>\n</em>\n<span> about this, or whatever you think you\u2019re doing. It was fucked up. Not because you\u2019re a kid. It was baseline fucked up for anyone. Believe me. I know.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter has evened out his breathing, but he can\u2019t quite stop himself from shaking, can\u2019t help the question lingering in his eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo here\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do,\" says Tony, answering it for him. \"You\u2019re gonna quit this not sleeping bullshit before you hurt yourself and further aggravate my publicly known, well-documented heart condition. You\u2019re going to </span>\n<em>\n<span>talk</span>\n</em>\n<span> to someone about this, and I mean talk like a person, not like a UCB student in the bitch slot of Tuesday night standup. And you\u2019re going to </span>\n<em>\n<span>stop</span>\n</em>\n<span> feeling embarrassed about a thing that you know deep down was completely and utterly out of your control. Got it?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter raises his eyebrows at him, and it\u2019s such a </span>\n<em>\n<span>teenager</span>\n</em>\n<span> thing to do that Tony hopes this isn\u2019t some indication that he\u2019s leaning into some rebellious phase two years too late. But then his expression softens, and his shoulders slump a bit, and after a few beats he slowly nods his head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGot it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood. Now, uh \u2026 \u201c </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony leans in to put a hand on the kid\u2019s shoulder again, but then the kid leans forward at the same time. For a second Tony almost deflects, almost says something to puncture the moment before it gets any more heavy than it already is \u2014\u00a0but the kid needs someone. And damn it all after the past few days if Tony doesn\u2019t, too. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s surprisingly easy, pulling the kid in, wrapping his arms around his shoulders. There\u2019s a beat where Peter finally seems to relax, and Tony closes his eyes for the briefest moments, trying and failing not to think of what he almost lost. And then \u2014\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, that\u2019s not a hug, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m just adjusting the IV.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony hears the grin in the kid\u2019s voice and pats him on the back as he pulls away, maybe a little harder than strictly necessary. He's surprised by how thick the words feel in his throat, by how easily he could come unraveled if he let himself say anything but this: \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019ve grown on me, you little shit.\u201d </span>\n</p>"
