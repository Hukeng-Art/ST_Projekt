  "notes": "<p>So, this one shot is a \u2018what if\u2019 scenario based off of Dark Matter, diverging from the main fic around after chapter 16. If you\u2019ve read up to chapter 16, you\u2019re good to go on this one. This is one of those \u2018What If\u2019 scenarios I kept mentioning in the comments. This one had to be cut because it causes quite a few plot holes in the main story line, but I liked it enough to keep it around as a separate thing. There are a few identity reveal ideas I had that ultimately didn't fit the main plot.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this first one has spoilers for the fic up to Chapter 16.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This was completed before I realized it caused a massive plot hole later on while also complicating the story beyond my ability to compensate, so it had to be cut. I still liked a few scenes and figured some of you might, too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the next chapter is on a brief hold until I fully hammer out the plot holes I found.</p>\n<p>Spoilers for Dark Matter up to chapter 16. Note that this hasn't been edited much/at all, so there might be continuity snags and plot holes.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t believe people have this one bookmarked, but here, have a Peter/Felicia flavored version of the Parent Teacher Conference.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I have, no joke, four other versions of the Parent Teacher Conference alone. One with Sam stepping in as Peter\u2019s \u2018parent\u2019 for the night. One where Peter is hit full blast with the fear toxin. Etc. That\u2019s not getting into the next main divergence point in the story: chapter 19. There are four other versions of that, too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Felicia has grown on me the more I write her, and I liked this version enough, so maybe a few others will, too.</p>\n<p>Again, spoilers for Chapter 16. This one almost made the final cut.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>The funniest part about all of this is that the Parent/Teacher conference wasn't even in any of my previous drafts. I tossed in a throwaway line and realized I needed to address it. That's partly why there's so many different versions.</p>\n<p>Again, Chapter 16 spoilers.</p>\n<p>I found the original one shot, but it is in ROUGH shape. It'll take time to clean up and I'd rather focus on other things first.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This ended the story too soon so it didn't happen. It was pretty good practice for crawling back inside Tony's head though.</p>\n<p>No spoilers for this one. This was one of the alternate versions of the original Dark Matter draft, written mostly as a thought experiment/warm up.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>There are a few more chapters of this, but I ultimately decided to go a different direction. Truth be told, I forgot I had this until I started digging through my documents folder and found it and a bunch of other one shots I've never bothered to upload.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Spoilers for up to chapter 31. Here's a scrapped identity reveal that I had to remove. It just doesn't work for the latter half of the story I have in mind. </p>\n<p>As a warning, it's only half edited and has a few plot holes.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>The mind control one is still on the menu, but it's going to be reworked and likely posted under its own fic eventually. It got a bit more involved.</p>\n<p>This is a scene I had written out that doesn't work with the plot I ultimately went with. No spoilers; it's just extraneous nonsense that worked more as a writing warm up than an actual plot.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>There's a few other no spoiler cut scenes I'll toss up eventually. Hope you enjoyed it!</p>\n<p>Got a few requests for alternate POVs for this chapter, here's the first! It's a bit more 'crack AU POV' than the others.</p>\n<p>Spoilers for chapter 41!</p>",
  "text": "<p>They leave the school together, strolling into the misty Gotham night side by side, just close enough that it doesn\u2019t look supremely awkward. Peter lets out a quiet breath of relief when they finally leave the school. The conference is done. And no one died, miraculously. Somehow, Loki managed to charm all of his teachers with only a few careful words and managed the whole situation beautifully. Peter didn\u2019t even have to fling himself out of the nearest window and flee into the night, never to be seen again. Minus that one hiccup with Tim and Duke\u2019s brother, the evening passed without incident. Mission success.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You should worry about what you promised him,</em>\u201d Fury says.</p>\n<p>Okay, yeah, fine, but one crisis at a time, okay?</p>\n<p>Loki pauses on the sidewalk outside of the school and turns to face Peter, reaching out to grip his shoulder. Peter, pale and shaky from a wicked combination of exhaustion, his growing migraine, and hunger pangs, frowns up at him. This isn\u2019t anywhere close to where they agreed to pull their disappearing act. </p>\n<p>\u201cListen, kid,\u201d he sas, pitching his voice just a bit too loud. Peter catches sight of Tim and Dick from the corner of his eye and realizes that Loki <em>wants</em> them to overhear this. Something icy grips his stomach and he\u2019s suddenly worried about whatever Loki\u2019s going to pull. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis whole \u2018us\u2019 thing. You and me, you know,\u201d Loki says, pointing to himself and then Peter. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s been great--you\u2019re a brilliant kid, all your teachers love you--but, uh, I\u2019m not really built for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s headache is getting worse. His temples throb, and his vision begins to go blurry at the edges. He sighs, exhausted. \u201cWhat are you--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m cutting you off. You\u2019ve been handling things on your own long enough that you\u2019ve got this all figured out anyway, so it won\u2019t be that much of a change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCutting me off,\u201d Peter repeats slowly. His blood is pounding in his ears; a sign of his worsening migraine. He raises his own voice, just to hear himself over it. \u201cCutting me off from what? This is the first time you\u2019ve done <em>anything</em> for me since we came to Gotham--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were supposed to be getting an allowance. You didn\u2019t get any of that? Huh. There must have been a problem at the bank,\u201d Loki says. He gives Peter an easy grin and gently punches his shoulder. It\u2019s unbelievably awkward, and Peter steps away from him on instinct. \u201cEven better! You\u2019re already fully independent. See, I knew you had this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stares at him for a long, silent moment that seems to drag on forever before saying, simply, \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re not getting it,\u201d Loki says. His tone grows firmer, and just a bit sharper; not quite a yell, but he is projecting his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re through. I\u2019m going to go my way, and you go your way.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then it clicks for Peter. Loki <em>used</em> him. The runes he traced out earlier severed him from whatever prison he was in. He\u2019s free of the Soul Stone, free of being trapped with the others. Peter just set the God of Mischief loose in this universe, free to do whatever he pleases. The gravity of the situation hits him fully then, and Peter pales. \u201cNo, no, you can\u2019t--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just did,\u201d Loki says from behind Tony\u2019s face, adjusting his cufflinks. \u201cBut hey, once you graduate, look me up in New York.\u201d He winks, and his grin grows sharper. \u201cI was serious about that job offer, and I\u2019d love to catch up with you in a few years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Son of a bitch,</em>\u201d Sam says quietly. \u201c<em>He played us.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just--\u201d Peter steps towards him, and then comes to an abrupt stop. Every nerve in his head flares up as if struck by lightning, and he\u2019s momentarily dazzled by a white hot pain stabbing the back of his eyes like railroad spikes. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnother migraine? Really? You should get that looked at. Maybe eat a little more,\u201d Loki says casually. He checks his watch. \u201cAnyway, I have a flight to catch. Good luck, Peter. It\u2019s been an experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter realizes that there\u2019s a subtle green to his migraine aura this time. Loki is <em>causing</em> the migraine; he probably started it back at the fire station. Loki turns to leave and Peter growls, marching after him. Another bright <em>flash</em> across his eyes causes him to stumble. </p>\n<p>Warm arms catch him, steadying him. A quiet voice murmurs near him. Tim's brother, Dick. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to talk to--\u201d Peter starts. He can\u2019t finish the sentence. Another of those horrible <em>flashes</em> hit him. This time, it\u2019s sharp enough to bring tears to his eyes. He can feel the arm around his shoulders tighten protectively.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s already gone,\u201d Dick says gently. \u201cCome on. You can stay with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I--I need to--\u201d Another flash. And Peter realizes that <em>this</em> was Loki\u2019s plan. To get him here and then abandon him, making a scene of it, so Peter would be delayed by Tim, Duke, and their brother. He tries to struggle free of Dick\u2019s grip, hastily wiping his eyes. He can\u2019t manage it; the migraine is getting worse, and his balance hasn\u2019t quite recovered. \u201cI need to go after him--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater,\u201d Tim says, his tone soft and protective. He settles a pair of sunglasses over Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with him later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Duke?\u201d Dick asks Tim quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI sent him a text a minute ago. He\u2019s getting the car,\u201d Tim answers, just as quietly. It\u2019s not quiet enough, not with Peter\u2019s sensitive hearing. \u201cAlfred\u2019s getting the spare bedroom ready, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dick says, relieved.</p>\n<p>A car rolls up to the curb and <em>god</em>, he can hear <em>every part of it. </em>The engine, well maintained as it is, still has a near overpowering growl. The hazard lights click on, and there\u2019s a weighted heat to the flashes when the light hits his skin. He can even hear the <em>fuel</em> rushing through the vehicle. Loki didn\u2019t turn his senses up to eleven. He shot them up to an even <em>one thousand.</em> Peter sways on his feet, nearly pitching forward. Dick adjusts his hold across his shoulders and braces him before he can fall.</p>\n<p>The door opens, and he\u2019s carefully nudged inside. Someone buckles him in, like a child, and he\u2019d be mortified and embarrassed if his head wasn\u2019t threatening to explode from pain. Other doors open, shut, there\u2019s murmured conversation he can\u2019t hear because of that ever present screeching whine in his ears, and then the car is in motion. The ride passes mostly in silence.</p>\n<p>Peter has half a mind to unbuckle himself, pop open the door, and then flee--</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No, stay here. If you jump out, you\u2019ll just tear yourself up,</em>\u201d Bucky says flatly. <em>\u201cAnd if you try, we\u2019ll get Duke to haul your dumb ass back in the car.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter feels someone startle in the seat beside him. Whoever it is--Duke, he realizes, he recognizes him through the gloom and sunglasses now--reaches out to take his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it easy, man. Go back to sleep. We\u2019re almost home,\u201d he says, pitching his voice low.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been asleep? When? Maybe after he was put into the car. It\u2019s a smooth ride, and the window glass is cold and soothing. Peter slumps back against the door with a quiet grunt, drifting back off. He <em>is</em> sleeping. Or dozing, at least, like he did when he was working with Batman a couple of days ago. This time instead of the cold, it\u2019s a vise grip burn of a migraine burrowing into his brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Tim asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he woke up and panicked,\u201d Duke says after a moment. \u201cSeems like he was about to jump out of the car and run?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMigraines can make you disoriented,\u201d Dick says. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t recognize where he was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Duke says after a moment. \u201cHow much further?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo minutes. Alfred is waiting for us,\u201d Dick says.</p>\n<p>Peter sleeps. This time, he doesn\u2019t stir when the car stops. He\u2019s vaguely aware of Duke gently pulling him away from the door and supporting him until Dick unbuckles him and lifts him up out of the car. He can feel the man grumble, shifting his hold as he carries Peter up a set of stairs. Peter tries to get up, to shift and move, but Dick keeps him braced against his chest with Peter\u2019s head resting against his shoulder.</p>\n<p>This is mortifying.</p>\n<p>\"<em>No shame in letting people carry you when you need it,\" </em>Sam says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s too light,\u201d Dick says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tim says with a sigh. \u201cHe is.\u201d</p>\n<p>A prim, polite, and decidedly British voice speaks next. Peter doesn\u2019t recognize it. \u201cI\u2019ve prepared the room across from yours, Master Richard.\u201d A pause. \u201cI\u2019ll see to finding him more clothing, and food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Alfred,\u201d Dick says. \u201cThat\u2019ll put him between Tim and Duke\u2019s room, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you informed Master Bruce yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>A very long pause follows that question. Finally, Tim clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll go make a phone call.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be wise, Master Tim,\u201d Alfred says politely.</p>\n<p>Peter drifts for a moment; it\u2019s hard to focus on his surroundings when his head is throbbing. When he stirs again, he\u2019s laying in a bed far too large and comfortable to belong to him. His headache has lessened, but hasn\u2019t fully disappeared. His shoes are off, and he\u2019s been tucked beneath blankets that are warm and soft. The curtains are drawn tight across the windows, and he can hear the gentle drumming of rain against the window. He can also hear three other heartbeats nearby, hidden in the dark.</p>\n<p><em>That</em> pushes him awake. He stirs, struggling to sit up. The pain in his head, which had settled to a dull roar, swells to an overpowering wave that paralyzes him before he can sit up. Loki\u2019s spell, whatever it was, is still powerful enough to knock him flat on his back. He hisses in pain.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Easy,</em>\u201d Wanda says gently. \u201c<em>It\u2019s your friends. They\u2019re staying close to you. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Now that she mentions it, he can make out the vague outlines of Duke, Tim, and Dick in the room, asleep in chairs or, in Tim\u2019s case, facedown on the floor. He stares at them for a moment, surprised, and then rubs his eyes, trying to sort out a rush of emotions that threaten to overwhelm him.</p>\n<p>One floats through the mess, rising to the top. He\u2019s going to kill Loki.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u2019s a thought for another day,\u201d</em> Wanda says before gently reaching out and tapping his forehead. The pain abates, and he starts to slip back into true sleep. \u201c<em>Rest.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He sleeps for a long time.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BATCHAT</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (10:30am):</strong> hey, good news</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (10:31am): </strong>Bruce had adoption papers half written out for Peter already</p>\n<p><strong>Jason (10:32am):</strong> Of course he fucking does.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (10:33am):</strong> yeah, not surprised</p>\n<p><strong>Steph (10:34am): </strong>can we even make fun of him for it at this point?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (10:35am):</strong> probably not</p>\n<p><strong>Duke (10:36am):</strong> hell yeah for not being the new kid anymore</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>He sleeps well into the next day. He only knows this based on half heard conversations from outside his door.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t getting better,\u201d Tim says, worried. \u201cIf anything it\u2019s worse. How long do migraines last? Are they supposed to last this long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get migraines, just headaches,\u201d Duke says. He pauses. \u201cI have an idea, hang on.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door to Peter\u2019s room inches open, casting in gentle light from the hallway. Peter can hear Duke step inside; his heartbeat, steady and healthy, sounds like thundering drums in the dark. Peter risks peeking out from under the blanket.</p>\n<p>\u201cSam, how do we help?\u201d Duke whispers.</p>\n<p>Something gold forms near Duke. Sam Wilson briefly becomes visible. \u201cBucky gets like this sometimes, too. He needs food. Soup, soft bread, electrolytes. And water. A ton of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s Bucky?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk Peter about Germany sometime to find out,\u201d Sam says. He starts to fade and hurries to add. \u201cPeter's starving. He can\u2019t heal without food. Make twice as much soup as you\u2019d make for an entire family and make sure he eats all of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, got it,\u201d Duke says. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam disappears. Peter settles back into his burning migraine.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The smell of freshly made soup and bread cuts through his pain like a knife. The pain rolls back so suddenly that it\u2019s almost disorienting. Alfred is in his room, carrying a bowl of steaming chicken broth and freshly made bread on a covered tray. Peter blinks awake, his head clearing for the first time since Loki manifested himself into reality. He sits up slowly, running one hand through sweat slick hair, squinting sleepily at the butler and the food.\n\u201c<em>He cast a curse with a very simple way to break it,\u201d </em>Dr. Strange murmurs appreciatively. \u201c<em>The pain lasts until Peter is fed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhich he wasn\u2019t likely to get if he went back to the fire station,\u201d</em> Hill says. \u201c<em>No wonder he made such a huge scene outside of the school. He wanted to give himself a head start.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you feeling well enough to eat, Master Peter?\u201d Alfred asks politely. His voice is low and gentle, wary of triggering the migraine.</p>\n<p>Peter, who has never been called a master <em>anything</em>, blinks up at him in confusion. \u201cI think so, yeah. Uh. How long was I asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost twelve hours,\u201d Alfred says, arranging his pillows to support his back before pulling out the sides of the tray to turn it into a table. He sets the table in front of Peter and uncovers the tray. \u201cJust a simple broth and bread for now, I\u2019m afraid. We'll move on to more substantial food when you're feeling better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter eyes the soup warily. Food has been a laughable idea during every other migraine, but this is different. He picks up the spoon and takes a wary sip of the broth.</p>\n<p>The pain disappears, only to be replaced with a ravenous hunger. Peter sets the spoon down, picks up the bowl, and outright drinks the broth. He drains it in seconds, sets the bowl down, and tears into the soft bread. It's the worst table manners he's ever shown, but he\u2019s too hungry to care.</p>\n<p>He's cleared the bowl and tray within a minute of Alfred setting it out for him. Alfred tilts his head and says, simply, \"Hm. I see we're ready for another helping.\"</p>\n<p>Peter rubs the back of his neck. \"Er, sorry--\"</p>\n<p>\"You have nothing to apologize for,\" Alfred says, taking the tray from him. \"Nothing at all. Please wait a moment, I'll return shortly.\"</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t exactly have an option. The migraine hangover and the extreme hunger have robbed him of his desire to get up and move. The bed is too comfortable, the room is too warm, the sound of the rain is too soothing. Alfred leaves the room with the tray, gently shutting the door behind himself.</p>\n<p>Peter leans back against the pillows, relaxing. There\u2019s a bone deep <em>itch</em> tingling up his back and into his arms and legs. It may have just been broth and bread, but it was <em>good</em> broth and bread. Enough to help, at least. Peter settles into the bed fully, dozing. He snaps out of it when Alfred wheels in an entire cart <em>full</em> of food.</p>\n<p>\u201cI decided this would be much more efficient,\u201d Alfred says. He sets out the tray again and covers it in small plates. Broth, soup, bread, water, tea. \u201cSince Master Duke\u2019s instincts were correct and it seems you only needed food to recover...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess I did,\u201d Peter says, staring at the food. He\u2019s close to <em>actually</em> drooling.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen eat your fill, Master Peter. And don\u2019t hesitate to ask for more. I understand things haven\u2019t been going in your favor for quite some time,\u201d Alfred says. The way he pauses at the sight of Peter makes Peter wonder exactly how bad he looks.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You look like a starving orphan,</em>\u201d Drax says helpfully. \u201c<em>Small. Pale. Pathetic. Like a puppy that is sad.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Great, thanks. Good to know.</p>\n<p>Peter starts to eat. He clears the entire cart of food, eating the tray bare and sitting back while Alfred fills it again. By the time he drinks the last bit of soup and eats the last crumb of bread, he\u2019s close to full and a low, tingly itch covers his body from head to toe. His healing factor is hard at work, apparently.</p>\n<p>Alfred takes the tray from him one last time. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter. Great,\u201d Peter says, fighting back a yawn. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome,\u201d Alfred replies. He tucks the blankets back around Peter. \u201cRest. When you\u2019re feeling well enough, I\u2019ve left a change of clothes in the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is suddenly aware of how <em>grimy</em> he feels. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alfred smiles, then leaves. Peter is asleep before the door shuts.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BATCHAT</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Steph (11:10am):</strong> so does anyone know where damian went?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (11:11am):</strong> he snuck into the plane when Bruce left</p>\n<p><strong>Steph (11:12am):</strong> okay that tracks</p>\n<p><strong>Steph (11:13am):</strong> in that case i\u2019m stealing this candy bar he had hidden in his room that\u2019s definitely not approved by alfred</p>\n<p><strong>Damian (11:14am):</strong> Touch anything in my room and you forfeit your life.</p>\n<p><strong>Steph (11:15am):</strong> come and stop me, wayne.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Steph has uploaded an image \u2018got_your_illegal_chocolate.jpg\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Damian (11:16am):</strong> Sleep with one eye open, Brown.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Peter wakes up, rolls out of bed, and shuffles straight for the bathroom tucked away into the corner of the room. He showers, revels in the warmth of the water, and then shuffles out. Clothes are neatly folded on a bench. Tim\u2019s clothes, actually; jeans, socks, shirt, and--amusingly enough--a sport coat. He changes, then pulls his old shoes back on; he and Tim definitely don\u2019t have the same shoe size and Peter\u2019s work well enough for now. </p>\n<p>He brushes his teeth, does his best to tame his hair, gives up, and steps back into the bedroom. He pauses to take in the room.</p>\n<p>It's easily the size of his apartment back in Queens. There\u2019s a bed, a desk, a small living room area complete with a small sofa, a plush chair, and a flat screen, and a door leading out to a balcony. Floor to ceiling windows line the wall, and beyond it, Peter can see the distant shape of Gotham City, muted by rain. It's strangely beautiful in the murky afternoon.</p>\n<p>He takes stock of himself. He feels great; he's not hungry, he's clean, he's warm, and it feels as if he can think clearly for the first time in months. He needs to thank Tim and Duke for bringing him here for the night. He owes them.</p>\n<p>It really is going to suck when he goes back to the fire station.</p>\n<p>\"<em>For a genius, you're an idiot sometimes,\" </em>Fury remarks.</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s just rude.</p>\n<p>A knock on his door brings him back to himself, and he\u2019s quick to cross the room and pull the door open.</p>\n<p>Dick is standing on the other side. He takes in Peter\u2019s appearance and perks up, smiling at him. </p>\n<p>\"Hey, Pete. How are you feeling?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"Human, for once,\" Peter answers, running a hand through his hair. \"Thanks for letting me stay the night. I think I needed it.\"</p>\n<p>Dick pauses and tilts his head. \"It isn't just for one night, Peter.\"</p>\n<p>Peter frowns. \"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"We overheard everything last night. It sounds like Tony isn't coming back for you,\" Dick says after a moment.</p>\n<p>Peter starts to protest, then stops. Tony <em>isn't </em>coming for him, but not for the reason Dick thinks. He frowns, staring past Dick.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I guess he isn't,\" he says after a long moment.</p>\n<p>\"You can stay here with us,\" Dick says. \"Alfred\u2019s already getting everything set up for you, and Duke and Tim are excited to have you here. Just stay here.\"</p>\n<p>Peter stares at him. \"Just like that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just like that,\" Dick says.</p>\n<p>Peter mulls it over. It really isn't much of a decision; either freeze and starve in Crime Alley, or stay here where he's safe, warm, and close to his friends. Bonus: the balcony in his room will make it easy to slip out for patrol. So will the warm bed and food. He'd have to sneak around Tim, Duke, Dick, and Alfred, but that shouldn't be too hard, right? Especially in a place this big.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Yeah, okay,\" Peter says. \"I, uh, think I'd like that.\"</p>\n<p>Dick smiles in relief, reaching out to squeeze his shoulder. \u201cGood. Welcome to the family, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is a little amused and curious about how <em>quickly</em> Dick has taken to him. He seems nice enough. Tim and Duke look up to him, and that\u2019s good enough for Peter, but he\u2019s curious about how familiar Dick is with him. They probably weren\u2019t talking about him to their big brother, right?</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d Peter says, rubbing the back of his neck. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have anything you want to grab from your old place?\u201d Dick says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, definitely. If you drop me off at a bus stop, I can go--\u201d</p>\n<p>Dick scoffs, holding up a set of car keys and motioning for Peter to follow him down the hall. \u201cYeah, right. Come on, I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Crime Alley,\u201d Peter says, following after him. He\u2019s briefly overwhelmed by the size of the manor. They walk down a grand staircase, with a family portrait hanging above the landing. A family portrait that includes <em>Bruce Fucking Wayne.</em> \u201cAre you, uh, sure you want to...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can handle Spider Alley,\u201d Dicks says dismissively, jogging down the steps. \u201cWe won\u2019t be very long, and it\u2019s day time anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hesitates, takes one last look up at the family portrait on the wall--how had he missed Bruce taking in so many kids?--and follows Dick outside. He\u2019s a lot less sure of his decision to stay at the manor now.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BATCHAT</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Duke (06:33pm): </strong>where\u2019s Peter?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (06:34pm):</strong> dick grabbed him to go get his stuff from his old place</p>\n<p><strong>Duke (06:35pm):</strong> okay good</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (06:36pm):</strong> btw, unrelated to everything, what was the ghost situation like in that car</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (06:37pm):</strong> like where did they even sit?</p>\n<p><strong>Duke (06:38pm):</strong> please stop</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The drive into the city is quiet. The steady rain turns freezing, and then into a steady sleet. The roads turn slick and the ever present fog that envelops the city lowers to ground level. Dick turns on some music, attempts to make some small talk, and then ultimately gives up when Peter doesn\u2019t respond much. He\u2019s being rude, and he knows it, but he needs some time to think. It\u2019s much easier now that he isn\u2019t starving or exhausted. Imagine that.</p>\n<p>How the <em>fuck</em> did he not notice that Tim and Duke are <em>literally</em> Bruce Wayne\u2019s kids? How did he miss that? Even <em>Steph</em> was on the family portrait, and he had no clue she spent much time with Tim and Duke outside of school. At least, not that he\u2019s noticed, but he also makes a habit of all but fleeing out of the school to go on patrol as soon as possible. He just never paid attention. </p>\n<p>He has the sinking suspicion that Bruce knows he\u2019s stolen from him, that he\u2019s just indulged in Peter's theft. God, he hopes not, he knows he covered his tracks, but he\u2019s not Ned. He might have missed something. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, where exactly am I taking you?\u201d Dick asks after a moment. He frowns at the surrounding buildings. Half are in blatant disrepair and somehow look even more pathetic in the sleet and rain. \u201cYou never gave me an address.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s in a weird spot. Parking is kind of at a premium,\u201d Peter says. He points to a strip mall parking lot playing host to a flea market despite the fog, the chill, and the rain. It\u2019s one of the safer parts of Crime Alley, and is coincidentally about as far as he wants to bring one of Bruce Wayne\u2019s kids into it. \u201cJust park here. I can walk the rest of the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dick glances at him from the corner of his eye, but dutifully turns off the main road and into the parking lot. He parks the car, turning it off. \u201cI\u2019ll walk with you--\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s out of the car the moment it stops, disappearing into the fog.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sneaking off from Dick probably hadn\u2019t been a good idea. He\u2019ll find his way back to the man eventually; he <em>did</em> agree to live at the manor with everyone, after all. He just needs some time to himself to think. Somewhere away from the manor. Somewhere familiar. Which just happens to be the building he climbed up that first month in Gotham, where he met Nightwing. He hasn\u2019t been here in awhile, and the climb up the fire escape had been mildly inconvenient with the icy rain, but he can withstand the cold much better today than usual.</p>\n<p>Too bad his thoughts aren\u2019t going anywhere helpful.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I think you\u2019ve sulked long enough,\u201d</em> Shuri says. \u201c<em>You should get your things.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, probably. The sleet is starting to bother him. He sighs, standing up and stretching, before considering the ground below. He could just walk down the side of the building and avoid the slippery fire escape altogether. That\u2019d be quicker, at least--</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you took a few steps back from that ledge,\u201d a calm voice says behind him. </p>\n<p>Peter startles in place and turns around to face the source of the voice. He ends up almost face to face with Dick Grayson, and aims a disbelieving look at him. That <em>voice.</em> It\u2019s a different accent, but someone trained by Batman would know to train themselves to use something other than their natural speaking voice, wouldn\u2019t they?</p>\n<p>Dick smiles sadly, walking over to Peter. He offers him his hand, just as he did as Nightwing. Peter hesitates for a moment before taking it. He doesn\u2019t need it, of course. He could sprint down the side of the building and be just fine. Dick takes hold of his hand and pulls him away from the ledge, shifting them so that he stands between Peter and the ice slick roof ledge. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d come back to this rooftop,\u201d Dick says, keeping his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou do like to come up here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I told you it\u2019s not what it looks like, would you believe me?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cEventually, but probably not right now,\u201d Dick admits, guiding Peter over to the fire escape. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, figured as much,\u201d Peter mutters. He climbs down the fire escape smoothly and drops to the asphalt with no problem; his old instincts are already in recovery after a few hearty meals from Alfred. \u201cI really do come up here to think, by the way. Things are clearer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t fault you for that. I\u2019m the same way with my night job,\u201d Dick says. He brushes off his hands and looks up and down the street. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Tim never mentioned your night job,\u201d Peter remarks. He wants to ask about that, wants to press him on the details, but holds off. Who knows who else is around?</p>\n<p>Dick smiles at that, as if laughing at his own private joke. Then his expression softens and he glances around the neighborhood. It\u2019s definitely not as nice as the run down strip mall where they parked. \u201cI never could figure out why you\u2019d choose this building. There\u2019s nothing around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s next to where I live,\u201d Peter says. He\u2019s actually kind of going to miss this horrible little neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Dick frowns at him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing around but half empty office buildings, warehouses, and an abandoned fire station. The nearest apartment is six blocks away, and that\u2019s not safe territory to cross at night in Crime Alley.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs, and motions for Dick to follow him over to the fire station. Dick follows him, but slows slightly when he sees Peter climb up the fire escape to the second floor window of the old fire station. The building, already a sad sight on a clear day, looks even worse with the onset of winter. Peter pauses at the window, crouching on the ledge, and looks down at Dick.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can wait there if you want. I won\u2019t be long, promise,\u201d Peter says. He ducks into the building and is pleasantly surprised to see that it\u2019s mostly dry inside. Sure, a part of the roof is leaking, but it\u2019s a slow trickle.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cBetter hurry,</em>\u201d Bucky says. \u201c<em>Grayson\u2019s behind you.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter starts to pack up his things. There isn\u2019t a lot, fortunately. His suit is tucked away in his backpack, he doesn\u2019t have any food to take, and he can just leave the electronics for now. A few are ruined by the leak, but they were already broken anyway. </p>\n<p>He hears Dick step in through the window and stop.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t look up, focused on packing. \u201cHey, I wanted to talk to you about last night, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dick says, subdued.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. About Tony. What you saw wasn\u2019t him, for the record,\u201d Peter says, gathering his things. He picks up the Stark radio he made months ago and turns it off. He doesn\u2019t need the alarm function anymore. \u201cHe\u2019s not actually like that. He doesn\u2019t drink anymore, he isn\u2019t some selfish monster. He\u2019s--he\u2019s a hero. Genuinely.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounds hollow and unconvincing even to his own ears. He sighs, packing away the rest of his things and turns to face Dick. He freezes when he sees the expression on Dick\u2019s face. Horrified is too mild a word. Heartbroken is close, but it doesn\u2019t encompass the furious set to his jaw.</p>\n<p>Peter stands there awkwardly for a moment, suddenly realizing how this must look. He fidgets with the Stark radio in his hands, then clears his throat. \u201cI, uh. I\u2019ve got everything I need.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dick takes one last look around the fire station, eyes roaming across Peter\u2019s makeshift desk, ramshackle lights, and 'bedroom' made of a tarp and ragged blankets, and takes in a deep breath, obviously fighting back a surge of fury. </p>\n<p>\"Good. Let's go home.\"</p>\n<p>The parent-teacher conference is going well enough, Peter supposes, despite the simmering tension and annoyance he has towards Loki. He follows Tim into the gym and frowns at how empty it is. In fact, there are only two other people in the gym: Duke and Felicia, who are sitting at the same table and deeply engrossed in a game of paper football. Duke\u2019s shot goes wide and Felicia raises her hands in apparent victory.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Peter asks, frowning at the empty room. The stillness annoys him somehow.</p>\n<p>Tim shrugs, waving at Duke before walking towards him with Peter. \u201cWe\u2019re the last appointments for the night, so we get the gym all to ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Peter says. Felicia brightens when she sees him and she scoots over on the bench so he can sit beside her. He drops down on to the bench and smiles at Duke and then her. He pitches his voice low enough that only she can hear. \u201cI totally saw you cheat just then. With your luck powers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat,\u201d Felicia whispers back. She smirks. \u201cIt only counts as cheating if you\u2019re caught.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely untrue,\u201d he retorts, fighting back a small grin when she winks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, lovebirds,\u201d Tim says. \u201cWhat\u2019re you two whispering about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter\u2019s inability to see things from my point of view,\u201d Felicia replies. She nudges Peter with her shoulder when he rolls his eyes. \u201cWho\u2019d you bring along anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony,\u201d Tim says.</p>\n<p>Felicia freezes. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Peter says, shooting Tim a warning look. He gets only a curious quirk of the eyebrow in response. \u201cBut yeah, someone is here for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>really?</em>\u201d Felicia asks, turning to face Peter completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d Peter says, shifting uncomfortably. His frustration is starting to build again, the anger rising up unbidden. Felicia\u2019s about to launch into another round of questions and Peter heads her off at the pass, standing up. \u201cListen, I\u2019m starving, I\u2019m going to go grab a snack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet me a candy bar while you\u2019re at it,\u201d Felicia says. Her eyes narrow just a bit, as well. She sees right through him, of course. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight, one terrible chocolate bar coming right up,\u201d Peter says, reaching into his pocket to grab his wallet as he heads for the nearest . His frustration eases somewhat when he\u2019s put some distance between himself and his friends, and he breathes a quiet sigh of relief when he reaches the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re losing it, man,</em>\u201d Quill points out, quite unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he might\u2019ve noticed. What is he even doing here? He should have blown off the conference entirely. Just ignored it. Instead, he\u2019s here, with Loki, trying to pretend to be normal. And now he has to dream up some explanation to Felicia, who is <em>definitely</em> going to ask him why Iron Man has time to show up for a stupid parent/teacher conference but doesn\u2019t have time to invent a way back home.</p>\n<p>God, she\u2019s going to be so pissed at him when he explains it to her. Because he will; he doesn\u2019t want to lie to the only other person from home he\u2019s found. Besides, she\u2019d see right through it. She\u2019s smart. Peter thumps his head against the vending machine, putting in a crumpled five dollar bill to grab Felicia\u2019s candy for her. The machine eats it, of course, and Peter\u2019s annoyance flares into true anger for the first time that night. He grabs the machine, gripping it tightly--</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Put it down,</em>\u201d T\u2019Challa says evenly. </p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t even realize he was holding it in the air. He pauses, then gently sets it back down and backs away from the machine with a shaky sigh. Okay, so maybe Loki was right. Maybe his anger issues are becoming worse. He runs a shaky hand through his hair and sighs, staring at the vending machine glumly.</p>\n<p>That was his last five dollars, dammit.</p>\n<p>Peter takes in a deep breath before heading back to the gym. He pushes open the door and freezes.</p>\n<p>Sometime between Peter leaving the gym and returning, the Joker showed up. Along with his little clown gang. Tim and Duke are tied up, both watching the Joker. The Joker is standing near the door, near Peter, holding a revolver aimed squarely at Felicia\u2019s head. </p>\n<p>Peter pauses only for a moment before stalking inside. \u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, goody, another hostage!\u201d Joker cries out in that infuriating singsong tone of his. \u201cTie yourself up with the others or I\u2019ll blow her brains out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glances at Felicia for only a moment, his stride never faltering. Joker scowls, and pulls the trigger. The gun <em>clicks</em>, the bullet jamming and preventing it from firing; likely a result of Felicia\u2019s luck powers. That little click, with the knowledge that Duke, Felicia, and Tim are in mortal danger sends his fury to a new level. He closes in on the Joker.</p>\n<p>The Joker whirls to face Peter, clearing the jam, and aims the gun at his heart. He starts to pull the trigger--</p>\n<p>Peter clamps his hand down over the Joker\u2019s and <em>squeezes. </em>He crushes the gun in Joker\u2019s hand, the metal crunching between his fingers as the gunpowder slips to the ground. The Joker\u2019s hand is similarly destroyed, and his grin turns pained and vaguely panicked when the delicate bones of his hand are crushed. The grin turns disbelieving when Peter pivots on one foot and flings the Joker into the wall across the room. The man hits the wall with the same heavy <em>thump</em> sound a bag of wet cement makes when dropped. There are a few crackling noises when he starts to move and Peter idly wonders how many of the man\u2019s bones he just broke. Usually this thought is followed by anxiety or sickening guilt. He feels none right now. </p>\n<p>In fact, he can hear the Joker\u2019s heartbeat from here, can hear him breathe in a pain chuckle, and he feels quite the opposite. He\u2019s almost completely lost to his rage. It burns cold, filling him with an icy determination as he stalks towards Joker. The Joker\u2019s minions, upon seeing this, sprint out of the nearest doors, leaving their weapons behind. Good for them. He might chase them down once he\u2019s done with Joker---</p>\n<p>Felicia steps in front of him, hands held out. \u201cPeter, enough. He\u2019s down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMove,\u201d Peter orders. His voice is flat and furious.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Felicia says, planting herself firmly in his path. When he tries to move around her, she matches him, one to one, reaching out to grab his arms. \u201c<em>Stop.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>He stops, annoyed, but unwilling to hurt Felicia. He would never hurt his friends, not even when he\u2019s this furious. But the anger is still there, and he glares at her, clenching his fists. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you defending him?\u201d he snaps. \u201cDo you know what he\u2019s done? What he was going to do to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do! But this isn\u2019t <em>you,\u201d </em>Felicia says. He can see the wariness in her eyes, but she doesn\u2019t show any other sign of fear. \u201cSpiderman doesn\u2019t kill. Everyone back home knew that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim and Duke, already watching them in shock, go very still. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t home,\u201d Peter says after a long moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still <em>Spiderman</em>,\u201d Felicia insists. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. You know you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life if you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter trembles with rage, looking from Felicia to Joker and back again. Finally he lets out a frustrated snarl of fury and whirls away from Felicia and Joker both, slamming a fist on the nearest table. It snaps in half and collapses to the gym floor. Peter closes his eyes and takes in a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Control it,</em>\u201d Bucky says. \u201c<em>You can\u2019t let it get away from you.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDeep breaths, Peter,</em>\u201d Shuri adds. \u201c<em>Give yourself a moment to come back from the anger.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Irritation and frustration go to war in his mind, but the longer he focuses on his shoes, the more it drains away. It leaves him, bit by bit, leaving exhaustion in its place. Behind him, he hears Felicia untie Tim and Duke.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp him,\u201d Felicia whispers. \u201cI\u2019m going to go check on our parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got him,\u201d Duke says.</p>\n<p>He hears Felicia slip out of the door, focusing on his breathing. And he hears two others approach him, slowly and cautiously, and suddenly feels very tired. He let his strength get away from him and now his friends are probably terrified of him.</p>\n<p>Great.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy, man,\u201d Duke says, reaching out to grab his shoulder. \u201cGive it a minute. The anger will go away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim leans around in front of him, looking him in the eye, then scanning his face. \u201cGreen eyes. White streak of hair. Ghosts. Preternatural strength. And mood swings. I can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t put it together before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPut what together?\u201d Peter asks, shaking out his fist. He hasn\u2019t used his super strength like this in a long time, and he\u2019s more than a little disturbed by it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were the person who came out of the Lazarus Machine,\u201d Tim says, as if that should make any kind of sense to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d Peter says, grounding himself through Duke\u2019s hold on his shoulder. He sighs and sits down at the nearest table. The one that isn\u2019t a pile of wood and debris, at least. Duke stays close, still with that comforting hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgly gray thing with a glass tube inside of it. And green liquid,\u201d Tim says. \u201cIt brings people back from the dead and has a habit of making them completely insane when they come back. We call it Pit Madness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Peter says dimly. \u201cYeah. That thing. I remember now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you remember from it?\u201d Duke asks warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cMostly that it hurt. And I was drowning in it, but I couldn\u2019t <em>fully</em> drown,\u201d Peter says, gaze unfocusing. \u201cI think they didn\u2019t get it right the first few times.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim and Duke have matching horrified expressions. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe first <em>few</em> times?\u201d Tim asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t want to remember it,\u201d Peter mutters, rubbing the back of his neck. He suddenly feels too hot and too cold, and his hands start to shake of their own volition. \u201cIt hurt. A lot. And I don\u2019t--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Duke cuts in gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about that later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, that sounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door to the gym slams open. Dick Grayson charges into the room, a fire axe in hand. He stops when he sees the destruction in the gym, and the crumpled and broken form of Joker on the other side of the room. He takes in the scene, lowers the axe to the ground and walks over to Tim, Duke, and Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Dick asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Joker tried to kill us and I threw him into a wall,\u201d Peter says. \u201cFelicia stopped me from killing him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dick takes that in with surprising calm. \u201cHuh. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter\u2019s Spiderman, by the way,\u201d Tim says helpfully.\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dick repeats, a bit less calmly now.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he came out of the Lazarus Machine we found awhile back,\u201d Duke adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dick says. \u201cStop saying things now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Felicia?\u201d Peter asks. He\u2019s suddenly very tired. </p>\n<p>\u201cWith Selina,\u201d Dick says. \u201cShe left with her the moment they found each other. She said the Joker was our problem and she didn\u2019t want Felicia getting mixed up with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHang on, time out,\u201d Duke says. \u201cFelicia is Selina\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Dick says. \u201cHonestly, Joker\u2019s lucky she wasn\u2019t hurt. I\u2019ve never seen Selina so protective. Kinda scary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFelicia\u2019s been through a lot. She needs that,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSays the guy who <em>drowned in a Lazarus Machine</em> more times than he can count,\u201d Tim says dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, it was, like, at most four times, guys. Calm down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not any better!\u201d Duke says in exasperated horror.</p>\n<p>Dick has his head in his hands now. \u201cCan the three of you <em>please</em> use the fire exit in the back corner so we can all go home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Peter says, standing up. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tony?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGone,\u201d Dick says, his tone carefully neutral. \u201cHe ran the moment the men with guns came into the cafeteria.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Peter says bitterly. \u201cGuess I\u2019m walking home--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Duke, help him for us,\u201d</em> Sam says quietly. \u201c<em>He\u2019s been getting worse ever since he came out of that machine.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Duke freezes for a moment, then walks up and slings an arm across Peter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cNope, you\u2019re coming home with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asks, frowning up at the taller boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna pass up a chance to talk with Spiderman? Come on,\u201d Duke scoffs. \u201cSorry, man, you\u2019re stuck with us tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd maybe a bit longer than that,\u201d Tim adds quietly. \u201cPit Madness is nothing to scoff at, Peter. We can help you with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Peter asks, turning to aim a questioning look at Tim. Duke has a firm arm across his shoulders in a hug that isn\u2019t quite protective, but isn\u2019t far off from it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe long and short version is therapy,\u201d Dick says, guiding the three of them over to his car. \u201cComing back from the dead is rough. It changes people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter isn\u2019t sure he wants to start that particular healing process yet. But he\u2019s positive he can\u2019t keep dealing with these bursts of rage on his own. Not as he has been. He frowns, going quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Dick continues. \u201cYou can stay with us. Alfred\u2019s already got a room for you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Peter settles into life at Wayne manor uneasily. He steadfastly refuses to talk to the others about Tony, or where he\u2019s been staying, and he can only guess at what they think of where he came from. It isn\u2019t good. He knows that much. Dick accidentally walked in on him changing shirts once and saw the bruises covering Peter\u2019s chest and back. The man had tensed, clenched his jaw, gently apologized for intruding, and then left. </p>\n<p>Peter has no idea how to explain the bruises came from his patrols as Spiderman, so he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Felicia visits him the next day, leaping up onto the balcony outside his bedroom and gently tapping on the door to get his attention. Peter dutifully opens it for her and steps outside. The wind is sharp and cold, and it cuts through his sweatpants and t-shirt immediately. He ignores it; he\u2019s still conditioned against it from living in that horrible fire station for months on end. </p>\n<p>Felicia isn\u2019t in her costume this time. She came as herself. She\u2019s balanced on the railing, watching him curiously. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d Felicia says. \u201cLooks like you found your Selina.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Peter says, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cIt almost seems too easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? Maybe you should take the easy path every now and then,\u201d Felicia says. She tilts her head. \u201cDo they know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d Peter admits. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for Bruce to come back to have some big family meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Felicia hums, idly kicking her feet. \u201cWhat will you tell them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is quiet for a moment. Finally, he says, \u201cEverything. Will you help me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Felicia smiles, ducking in close to kiss his cheek. \u201cAll you had to do was ask, spider.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Peter wakes up, it happens all at once. One moment, he\u2019s in a deep, restful sleep and the next he\u2019s wide awake and on his feet. His stomach clenches painfully; a half day at school has robbed him of the largest meal of his deal, and the sandwich Lou gave him this morning is long gone apparently. He runs a hand through his hair, attempts to smooth out the wrinkles in his uniform, and checks the time. And then groans.</p>\n<p>The conference starts in an hour and he\u2019s still no closer to figuring out a solution than he was before his sudden nap. He sighs, grabs his notebook and a pen, and starts to doodle. Doodling helps him think, calms him down. He lets the pen move on its own, frustrated and hungry.</p>\n<p>If he had <em>help </em>maybe---</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flash of gold. And suddenly, Sam Wilson is standing in the middle of the room, wearing jeans, a plain shirt, a brown leather jacket, and simple tennis shoes. His wings are noticeably absent. Peter stops midstep, staring at Sam blankly. Sam seems as shocked as Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh. Guess that snake wasn\u2019t lying after all.\u201d He rolls his shoulders, stomps his feet, and lets out a relieved sigh when his body obeys each command as it should. He pats his pocket and pulls out a wallet, peering inside before nodding and pocketing it again. \u201cOkay, everything\u2019s where it should be. Probably. Come on, kid, let\u2019s get a move on. Loki can\u2019t keep this up forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Peter asks dumbly, after a significant pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour conference. I\u2019m standing in for Tony tonight,\u201d Sam says. He pauses, frowns. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop and get you some food on the way. You look like hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like it, too,\u201d Peter mutters. He frowns, fidgeting some, but follows Sam towards the window and the fire escape. \u201cLoki used a spell to bring you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he did. Even brought back my stuff,\u201d Sam says, holding up his wallet again before pocketing it. He hops down to the street lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill your cards work?\u201d Peter asks him, dropping down beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but the cash will,\u201d Sam says. He nods towards the subway station. \u201cI\u2019ve got fifty bucks and know at least three places we can hit up on the way to your school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWon\u2019t that make us late?\u201d Peter asks, frowning up at him.</p>\n<p>Sam shrugs. \u201cOnly a little. And who cares? If things play out right, we won\u2019t need to worry about you starving after tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter feels a rush of relief. Things will be easier if Sam\u2019s here. He\u2019s Captain America\u2019s best friend, right? He knows how to handle situations like this. Sure, they\u2019re not super close, but he trusts the man based on that alone. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>Sam smiles at him briefly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you, Pete. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sam takes him to Batburger and buys half the menu. He doesn\u2019t eat anything himself; he simply kicks back in his seat and looks around the restaurant while Peter demolishes the burgers, fries, and onion rings spread across the table in front of him. He has a wistful look on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Peter asks around a mouthful of cheeseburger.</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, eat with your mouth closed,\u201d Sam replies, tossing a straw wrapper at him. \u201cAnd nothing. It\u2019s just nice to see people clearly again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see things before?\u201d Peter asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe did, but nothing\u2019s clear. It\u2019s like walking through frosted glass most of the time. We see people close to you, but it\u2019s hard to hear them sometimes. Everything\u2019s muffled,\u201d Sam says. \u201cDuke and Nightwing are the only ones we can see clearly from any distance. Duke more than Nightwing. Usually we just see and hear you. Your thoughts and feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI wonder why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a few working theories,\u201d Sam says. He checks his watch. \u201cFinish up, the parent teacher conference starts in thirty minutes.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fifteen minutes away from the school,\u201d Peter says. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there on time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as on time. You\u2019re either early or late,\u201d Sam replies.</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes, but dutifully cleans up his mess and heads for the door with Sam. He feels <em>great</em> after that meal, and his mood, already high now that he has an Avenger with him, climbs higher when the food hits him. He\u2019s even a little energetic, lightly bouncing on his feet, ready to take on the world. </p>\n<p>Sam shakes his head, amused, and pushes the door open for Peter. \u201cMan, you\u2019re just like my nephews.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sam whistles lowly as they walk up the sidewalk leading to Gotham Prep. The school looks foreboding in the night, lit up against the night with dark storm clouds roiling above it threateningly. The smell of rain lingers heavy in the air, and thunder rolls in the distance. Other parents and students are walking to and from the entrance, most of them heading inside, but there\u2019s a small group gathered at the entrance: Tim, Duke, Selina, Felicia, a brown skinned man wearing business casual clothes, and Bruce Wayne. </p>\n<p>As in, the Bruce Wayne Peter\u2019s stolen from.</p>\n<p>The same Bruce Wayne who is smiling fondly at Selina while Tim and Duke look vaguely shellshocked beside him.</p>\n<p>Peter stutters to a stop on the sidewalk. Tim and Duke spot him immediately, of course, and both nod or wave and then focus on Sam. Tim frowns and tilts his head curiously. Duke stares in open mouthed shock. Felicia\u2019s expression isn\u2019t much different from Duke\u2019s. Neither reaction goes unnoticed by the rest of their group; Bruce, Selina, Felicia, and the brown skinned man all turn to look at Peter and Sam.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Peter mutters. \u201cWhy is Bruce Wayne here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably the same reason I\u2019m here,\u201d Sam says, mild amusement in his tone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d Peter says. \u201cWe should go back--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late to get cold feet now, Pete,\u201d Sam says mildly, smiling and waving at the small group.</p>\n<p>Bruce returns the wave.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could sprint away into the night, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Sam says, walking towards the school.</p>\n<p>Peter sighs, but follows him. Naturally, that\u2019s when the rain outside starts to fall. Peter doesn\u2019t have his umbrella with him, or his blazer, or the jacket he normally wears when leaving the firestation. He\u2019s just wearing a plain button down shirt with his uniform slacks. He sighs when the rain pelts him full force.</p>\n<p>\n\u201cDammit,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Sam stops, shrugs off his jacket, and drops it on Peter\u2019s head. \u201cUse that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinks, but pulls it on. It\u2019s far too big for him--Sam is just as broad shouldered and strong as Cap, after all--but it\u2019s warm. He has to roll up the sleeves just so his hands aren\u2019t lost inside them. It\u2019s the most comfortable thing he\u2019s worn since he came to Gotham.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Sam nods, and they close distance with the others quickly. Bruce smiles, easy and friendly, and offers his hand to Sam. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Bruce Wayne. These are my sons, Dick, Duke, and Tim,\u201d he says, nodding to each in turn. </p>\n<p>\u201cSam Wilson, filling in for Tony tonight,\u201d Sam says, shaking his hand. He smiles at Duke and Tim. \u201cHey, guys. Peter\u2019s told me a lot about you two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he has,\u201d Duke says slowly. There\u2019s an odd tone to his voice that the Waynes pick up on immediately.</p>\n<p>Sam turns his attention to Selina and Felicia, offering his hand to them both. \u201cMa\u2019am, Felicia. Good to meet you both.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Selina says pleasantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Sam Wilson,\u201d Felicia says numbly. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLong story. Ask Pete, he can fill you in,\u201d Sam says. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think we have a lot of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d Bruce says, pulling the door open and motioning for everyone to head inside. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside before the storm gets worse. Here, I\u2019ll show you where to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, I appreciate it,\u201d Sam says, holding the door open for Peter, Felicia, and Selina before following them into the school.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * *</p>\n<p>Duke hangs back with Tim, watching the rain, trying to get his thoughts in order. The rain is pulling no punches now, and the thunder is a constant growl in the sky above. Tim watches his brother for a moment. </p>\n<p>\u201cSam Wilson,\u201d Tim says idly. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of Peter\u2019s ghosts,\u201d Duke says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tim says, drinking his coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Duke asks, facing him. \u201cHow? I\u2019ve never described him to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rain,\u201d Tim points out. \u201cHe was standing in the middle of all that rain and was perfectly dry.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Bruce, Sam, and Selina walk three abreast, talking amongst each other in pleasant tones. The typical \u201chi-how-are-you-what-do-you-do\u201d kind of conversation people seem to fall into once they\u2019ve hit full adulthood. Peter tunes it out; he trusts Sam. He doesn\u2019t need to keep up with everything the man is saying.</p>\n<p>He walks beside Felicia, who is still caught up in some kind of disbelieving shock. Peter spares her a few worried glances as they head down the hall. The brown skinned man, Dick, offers his hand to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Peter,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His tone is earnest and friendly, and the way he says Peter\u2019s name seems oddly familiar. Peter returns his smile and shakes his hand politely. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe students are supposed to stay in the gym during the conferences,\u201d Dick says. He nods towards the double doors at the end of the hallway. \u201cThere should be snacks there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter says. He nudges Felicia, who blinks at him, before stiffly turning and walking down the hall. Peter fights back a sigh. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Dick asks, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cExams next week. You know.\u201d Peter shrugs. It\u2019s not a convincing lie, and also probably not true. He has no idea when exams start up. </p>\n<p>Dick is polite enough to not comment on it. \u201cHuh. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you,\u201d Peter says politely before heading down the hall himself.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s barely through the gym doors when Felicia <em>appears</em> beside him, staring at him hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is <em>Sam Wilson</em> here?\u201d she hisses.</p>\n<p>Peter takes in a deep breath and lets it out slowly, fidgeting with Sam\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is going to be a weird one.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The conferences are going well. Sam is polite, attentive, and perfectly charming towards Peter\u2019s teachers. He\u2019s also being watched like a hawk by Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. Selina is much more subtle about it, but just as focused. That suits him fine. He knows who they are; all of the Dusted see other souls as they truly are, and he\u2019d recognize Nightwing and Batman anywhere. He finishes the last meeting of the evening and checks his watch. And then pauses and looks at his hand. </p>\n<p>A single flake of ash falls from his hand and drifts to the floor. Sam watches it fall, considers what it means, and what Loki and Strange told him in the Soul Stone shortly before Peter woke up.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have much time left. He pauses for a moment, gathers his thoughts, and walks towards Bruce and Dick. Both men are in quiet conversation with each other and fall silent when he gets close. They wear matching expressions, equal parts curious and wary, as if they aren\u2019t sure what to make of him.</p>\n<p>He leans against the wall beside them and says, in a voice just loud enough for them to hear, \u201cBatman, Nightwing, I need your help. It\u2019s about Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>If he had their curiosity before, he has their alarmed attention now. Bruce and Dick share a brief expression with one another before Bruce nods to Sam. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can we do for you, Sam?\u201d Bruce asks.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, the whole group is walking outside and into the parking lot. The rain has softened into a light mist that drifts past the streetlights, and the thunder has fallen silent. The air is chill and damp, but it doesn\u2019t affect Peter\u2019s mood much. The parking lot is empty except for a few cars and Peter\u2019s little group. He and Sam are walking ahead of the pack, but he slows when Sam reaches out to grab his shoulder and tug him off to the side for a few steps. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, listen, I don\u2019t have much time left,\u201d Sam says, and there\u2019s genuine regret in his tone. \u201cLoki and Strange can\u2019t keep this up forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter freezes. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re not--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not back. Not fully. And you probably won\u2019t be able to hear me for a long time after this,\u201d Sam says. He shrugs at Peter\u2019s confused frown. \u201cThis was a one time deal. I\u2019m kind of burning up my soul to pull this off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re--what?\u201d Peter asks, horrified. \u201cWhy would you--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo get you help. I promised I\u2019d take care of you, and I meant,\u201d Sam says. \u201cWhen we finish talking, you\u2019re going to go talk to Bruce and Dick and tell them what\u2019s going on with you. They\u2019re going to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSam, no, I can\u2019t,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI can\u2019t get them wrapped up in this. If they get hurt because of me--\u201d</p>\n<p>He trails off. Sam watches him evenly; Peter can tell he\u2019s getting nowhere with the man. He clenches his jaw. \"It's my fault we lost. Everyone else--if I'd been stronger or faster, he never would've had the chance--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Sam says.</p>\n<p>\u201c--and then I got off light,\u201d Peter says, talking over Sam. \u201cI came back--\u201d</p>\n<p>\"<em>Bullshit,</em>\" Sam says, cutting him off. \"He made sure you suffered worse than anyone else. He killed you as slowly and painfully as he could.\"</p>\n<p>\"How do you know?\" Peter asks, frowning at him. </p>\n<p>\"We <em>watched it happen.</em> We watched him pull you apart in front of Tony! We were <em>there,</em>\u201d Sam says.</p>\n<p>Peter freezes. They watched him die? God, he\u2019d been babbling like a terrified child, clinging to Tony and begging him for help. He stares at Sam, shocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had it worse than any one of us and you know it!\" Sam snaps, crowding him. \"Ever since you woke up in that weird ass machine, you've been avoiding help and putting yourself in danger because you think you don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can handle it,\u201d Peter says. The unsaid half of the sentence passes between them: <em>Because I don\u2019t deserve it.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThe hell you can!\u201d Sam says. \u201cIf you keep it up, you'll die again. For real this time. I'm not gonna let that happen.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cSam--\u201d Peter starts. And then he stops. To his horror, Sam starts to flake away and crumble into ash, just like the Guardians did on Titan. Just like <em>he</em> did. Peter\u2019s panic is both instantaneous and overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\"No, no, no--how do I stop it?\" he asks, reaching out to grab Sam. He grabs nothing but ash and dust. It clings to his hands and sticks to his fingers. He makes a quiet, panicked keening noise. \"Not again--\"</p>\n<p>\"You can't stop it,\u201d Sam says gently. He\u2019s in pain, but he\u2019s doing his best to not show it. \u201cJust get some help, man. Take care of yourself.\"</p>\n<p>And then he's gone. Peter trembles, clutching the ashes in his hands, staring at the ground where the Avenger had stood only seconds before. A hand falls on his shoulder. He looks up and, through his tears, finds himself locking eyes with Bruce Wayne. The look he gives Peter is sympathetic, maybe even heartbroken. </p>\n<p>\"Come on,\" he says, his tone gentle. \"Sam wanted us to talk. All of us.\"</p>\n<p>Peter stares up at him dumbly. Bruce nods towards Felica and Selina. Felicia is ghostly pale, her hands trembling at her sides, staring at the ash and dust on the ground in front of Peter. Selina finally steps in front of her, blocking her view of the ash pile, and speaks in quiet, soothing tones.</p>\n<p>It works. Felicia snaps out of her daze, blinking, and then clings to Selina, hugging her desperately. Selina pauses only for a moment before hugging her protectively. She casts a curious look over her shoulder towards Bruce.</p>\n<p>Bruce squeezes Peter\u2019s shoulder for a moment. \u201cStay here. We\u2019ll talk at the manor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d Peter asks him numbly.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything. And I just overheard the details he didn\u2019t share,\u201d Bruce says.</p>\n<p>The Compound is exactly how he left it. Tony is both glad and annoyed by that realization. He\u2019s also annoyed by how quiet and subdued the reporters are in the next room. He\u2019s been to thousands of press conferences and press releases, and he can count on one hand how many were this <em>quiet.</em> Reporters are chatty by default, always jockeying for inside scoops even among their own, especially when it comes to Stark Industries. They\u2019re eerily silent now, just like the cities, just like the social media feeds, just like <em>everything</em> is. Six months ago, the world ended, and the shocked silence lingers, along with the dust.</p>\n<p>The same dust that\u2019s blotting out the sun and causing a nuclear winter, in fact. The reason why he\u2019s here.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for coming, Tony,\u201d Natasha says, reaching out to gently squeeze his forearm. The touch is brief, gentle, and reassuring.</p>\n<p>Tony Stark, dressed in one of his finest suits, does his best to not fidget. He\u2019s surprised he has to struggle against that. He very clearly remembers being trained out of such small showings of his own humanity by his father. The lessons seemed bone deep and lifelong at the time, but ever since Titan, he\u2019s struggled to maintain his press ready persona. </p>\n<p>A lot of things have gotten harder since Titan, really.</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of missing it,\u201d Tony says, giving in to his fidgeting and adjusting his cufflinks. His suit coat is open, and the first three buttons are undone to make room for the arc reactor beneath his shirt. A precaution, and one he\u2019d debated taking. \u201cEspecially since it\u2019s my company doing the heavy lifting.\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him a wry smirk from Natasha. She knows as well as he does that Stark Industries is almost entirely under Pepper\u2019s control these days. \u201cAnd we appreciate it. Trust me. This will help a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony nods. Money doesn\u2019t really account for much in the post apocalypse, but logistics <em>does.</em> And logistics running on clean power that can self-sustain for years at a time is a necessity. Hell, even the clean power is a necessity, as well as the Stark communications satellites that ring the Earth. Donating all of that for the good of humanity is the least he can do after Titan.</p>\n<p>The door opens, and Steve Rogers steps through. He pauses when he sees Tony, clearly caught off guard. Tony feels a surge of annoyance at the sight of the man, but fights it back; the bitterness he feels towards the others, and Steve in particular, is best kept in his workshop at the lake house where he can nurse it in private. He settles for a stiff nod of acknowledgement and focuses on his cufflinks again.</p>\n<p>Much to his annoyance, Steve takes that as an invitation. The man walks towards them. \u201cTony. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy, Rogers, this isn\u2019t a social call,\u201d Tony replies. \u201cJust doing a favor for Nat here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve continues doggedly on. \u201cStill, I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re doing better.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds so <em>sincere</em>, damn him. Tony takes in a deep breath, and bites back on his immediate retort, searching for something to say. He opens his mouth--</p>\n<p>And a sudden flash of orange and red blinds him. Tony blinks away the purple black shadows of the others floating in his sight. He rubs his eyes, on high alert. Are they under attack--</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Loki says. \u201cThere you are. Excellent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha and Steve are so thrown by Loki\u2019s blinding appearance that they don\u2019t react when the man reaches out and grabs hold of Tony\u2019s arm. He turns to Natasha. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m borrowing him for a little while, please excuse us,\u201d Loki says politely. And then he taps his foot against something on the ground.</p>\n<p>Tony is yanked right out of the reality he\u2019s always known.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s moving faster than he ever has in his life, dragged through a landscape of shadowy nothing. Loki has an iron grip on his arm with one hand while the other clings to a thin red thread that shouldn\u2019t be capable of pulling <em>anyone</em> along at speed, let alone two full adults. Loki glances back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a few minutes before we arrive. I\u2019ll need to fill you in,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cFill me in? On what?\u201d Tony asks. He slowly reaches for the arc reactor on his chest.</p>\n<p>Loki notices, of course. How can he not? They\u2019re in a <em>void.</em> \u201cPeter Parker is alive, and he needs your help. I assume <em>that </em>has your attention?\u201d</p>\n<p>It does.</p>\n<p>Loki tells him everything. Tony listens.</p>\n<p>By the time they reach their destination, Tony has already started to make plans.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When Peter wakes up, it happens all at once. One moment, he\u2019s in a deep, restful sleep and the next he\u2019s wide awake and on his feet. His stomach clenches painfully; a half day at school has robbed him of the largest meal of his deal, and the sandwich Lou gave him this morning is long gone apparently. He runs a hand through his hair, attempts to smooth out the wrinkles in his uniform, and checks the time. And then groans.</p>\n<p>The conference starts in an hour and he\u2019s still no closer to figuring out a solution than he was before his sudden nap. He sighs, grabs his notebook and a pen, and starts to doodle. Doodling helps him think, calms him down. He lets the pen move on its own, frustrated and hungry.</p>\n<p>If he had <em>help </em>maybe---</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flash of gold. And suddenly, Tony Stark is standing in the middle of the room, wearing the same suit he wore the day he offered to make Peter an Avenger at the Compound. He looks around in blatant confusion. Peter stops midstep, staring at Tony blankly. Tony seems as shocked as Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, Peter? Is that you?\u201d Tony asks, his voice raw. \u201cYour eyes--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI--yeah, it\u2019s me,\u201d Peter says. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLoki just popped up and grabbed me. He said you needed my help.\u201d Tony says, taking in his surroundings. He frowns, walking towards Peter and looking him over. The longer he looks, the more alarmed he seems to become. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t kidding. Have you been living like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s better than the streets,\u201d Peter mumbles, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cAnd it\u2019s worked--\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of his sentence is cut off. Tony grips his shoulders, steadies him for a moment, and then pulls him into a fierce, protective hug. Peter pauses for a moment, thrown, and then melts into the embrace, mumbling against Tony\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh. This is nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sags into the hug and Tony has to shift his feet to keep from losing balance. They stay like that for a moment before Tony leans back, taking stock of Peter. The \u201cGod, kid. You look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you came all the way here just to tell me that, I\u2019m going to say you\u2019re way more petty than I thought,\u201d Peter says through a watery grin. \u201cAre you here to stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Tony says. \u201cLoki and Dr. Strange are keeping me here. They won\u2019t be able to keep it up for more than eight hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s no time at all. Peter\u2019s shoulders sag. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut I have ideas on how to get back,\u201d Tony says. He pulls the arc reactor off of his undershirt and puts it into Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cYou hold onto this. And here, this too.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls out his cell phone. It isn\u2019t registered for any networks here--Stark Communications definitely isn\u2019t a <em>thing</em> in this universe--but Peter knows it can carry a charge for months at a time and the wifi should work just as well. It also has a copy of FRIDAY on it; nowhere near as sophisticated as her Compound self, but a genuine AI. Tony shoves his phone into Peter\u2019s hand beside the arc reactor. Finally, he pulls out his wallet and pulls out a ludicrous amount of bills.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony--\u201d Peter starts, alarmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, kid, it isn\u2019t worth much back home. Not anymore. Take it,\u201d Tony says. He pauses, glances around the fire station for a long moment, and lets out a slow breath. \u201cRight. Okay. Tech, money, now to get you somewhere safe. With an actual roof over your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, the roof here only leaks <em>sometimes</em>,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>Tony gives him a flat look. \u201cI\u2019m ignoring that. You have friends here? Loki said something about a girl? Felicity or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFelicia. And I\u2019m not sure her guardian will let me sleep there,\u201d Peter says, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cSince I\u2019m dating her adopted kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably not going to happen. Your friends, then? Duke?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>Peter hesitates. \u201cI mean, yeah, they probably will let me stay, but I don\u2019t know how long--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d Tony says, decision clearly already made. He looks around, and heads for the window Peter\u2019s been using as his front door for the fire station. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go talk to them at that conference. I\u2019ll even meet your teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stands in the middle of the fire station, clutching a phone, an arc reactor, and enough money to keep himself fed for six months. He boggles at his luck, boggles <em>more</em> at the fact that this is happening at all, and then quickly pockets the money and phone. After a few moments of hesitation, he unbuttons his uniform shirt and gently places the arc reactor on his own undershirt, quickly doing up the buttons again. The reactor is solid and warm against his chest, even through his shirt, and its gentle glow is hidden by the fabric of his uniform shirt. It\u2019s a comforting weight; proof that this is happening for real.</p>\n<p>Tony calls out from the fire escape. \u201cClock\u2019s ticking, kid, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Tony grabs burgers for them on the way. They eat on the move. Tony seems to be enjoying the burger as much as Peter, if not more. At Peter\u2019s questioning look, he sighs. </p>\n<p>\u201cMeat\u2019s kind of a luxury these days back home. Don\u2019t worry about it, kid,\u201d he says, balling up the wrapper and tossing it into the nearest bin. Peter mimics the move, but with more flourish and nails it. Tony smirks. \u201cShow off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta keep you humble, old man,\u201d Peter says, grinning back at him.</p>\n<p>Tony scoffs, nudging Peter with his elbow. He stops suddenly and turns to Peter, his expression serious. \u201cListen, no matter what happens, I will find you. All right? <em>I will come back for you.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinks up at him, and smiles. \u201cYeah. I know you will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony nods, clapping Peter\u2019s shoulder before walking with him towards the school. He keeps his hand there as they walk towards the school. Peter grins at Duke and Tim with a free and easy smile that they\u2019ve never seen from him before, lifting a hand up to wave at them as they approach.</p>\n<p>Felicia is staring at Tony and Peter with nothing short of absolute shock on her face.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BATCHAT</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Duke (05:58pm):</strong> for those keeping score at home, we\u2019re on minute fifteen of Peter and Felicia\u2019s argument</p>\n<p><strong>Barbara (05:59pm):</strong> Who\u2019s winning?</p>\n<p><strong>Duke (06:00pm):</strong> steph.</p>\n<p><strong>Barbara (06:01pm):</strong> Yeah, that tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (06:02pm):</strong> so how\u2019s things with Tony, Dick?</p>\n<p><strong>Dick (06:03pm):</strong> He\u2019s nervous. He keeps checking his watch, and looking over his shoulder.</p>\n<p><strong>Dick (06:04pm):</strong> It\u2019s like he expects someone to show up and shoot him.</p>\n<p><strong>Duke (06:05pm):</strong> Felicia and Peter both said he was out of town for awhile. Think he was hiding from someone?</p>\n<p><strong>Dick (06:06pm):</strong> I think so. He says he\u2019s out of here at midnight. A red eye flight, I think.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Tony is quick and efficient with the faculty, but just as charming as he can manage. He comes back from his latest meeting--some smug prick of a physics teacher--impatient and a little tired. He walks over to Dick Grayson and leans back against the wall beside the man, sighing. One more meeting and he\u2019s free and clear, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem pretty distracted tonight, Mr. Stark,\u201d Dick says idly in the cafeteria. He\u2019s watching Tony from the corner of his eye. His tone is innocent enough, but Tony can\u2019t help but feel like there\u2019s some kind of unspoken accusation behind his words. \u201cIt almost seems like you want to be somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Yeah, with the kid,</em> he thinks. He says, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not totally wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him a slightly sharp look from the man and Tony fights back a sigh. He can\u2019t afford to chase off this guy. Not if what Loki said was true. He sets his drink down and faces Dick fully. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour kids are friends with mine, right?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy brothers,\u201d Dick corrects. \u201cBut yes. Peter\u2019s their best friend. He\u2019s good for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Peter needed a safe place to stay, could he stay with them? With you guys?\u201d Tony asks. </p>\n<p>Dick blinks, but his answer is immediate. \u201cOf course he can stay with us. Mr. Stark, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in trouble,\u201d Tony says. \u201cBig trouble. Bad people are looking for me--\u201d Technically true. \u201c--and if they find me near Pete, they\u2019ll hurt him worse than you can imagine. They already have. I can\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dick looks fully alarmed now. He can tell Tony isn\u2019t lying. \u201cHave you gone to the police?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cThe police can\u2019t help. This is way past their pay grade,\u201d Tony says. \u201cThe best thing I can do is get Pete somewhere safe and lead the assholes away from him. I know I\u2019m asking a pretty big favor--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already said he can stay with us. For as long as he needs,\u201d Dick says. He\u2019s looking at Tony in a new light now, and though he\u2019s still wary of the man, the outright hostility has drained away. \u201cYou should stay, too. Peter needs you, and we can help keep you safe--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay. It\u2019s not my choice,\u201d Tony says. \u201cJust, thank you. As long as I know he\u2019s safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Of course,\u201d Dick says, frowning at Tony. And then he freezes, staring at Tony\u2019s hand. Or, rather, the ashes flaking off of Tony\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>Tony frowns at him in confusion, then looks at his hand. He clenches his fist. Ashes fall like snow from his hand. It\u2019s significantly less <em>handlike</em> now and Tony curses, covering it with his free hand. He can feel the pain of it now, and it\u2019s sharp enough to make him inhale.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Tony hisses. The pain is crawling up his arm now. He has seconds. \u201cHe promised he\u2019d give me more time--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do we stop it?\u201d Dick asks, clearly out of his depth but doing his best to keep calm. Tony\u2019s opinion of the man raises a few more notches. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Tony says. \u201cGet me out of here before I cause a scene. I can\u2019t do this in front of the kid\u2019s teachers--\u201d</p>\n<p>Dick grabs his good arm and leads him through a nearby fire exit propped open to let in fresh air. Tony stumbles into the frigid, wet air outside and braces himself against the slick wall of the school. The pain is worse now; a burning sensation that cuts a searing line up his arm. Ash falls out of his sleeve like a waterfall, and then that starts to flake away, too. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck.</em> Is this what it was like for Peter?\u201d Tony mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is happening to you?\u201d Dick asks helplessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m dying the same way Peter did,\u201d Tony says. \u201cShit. Promise me he\u2019s safe with you. <em>Promise me.</em> I\u2019ll get on my knees and beg if I have to--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have knees anymore,\u201d Dick says numbly. \u201cAnd that isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Thank you,\u201d Tony says.</p>\n<p>And then he collapses into a pile of ashes. A gust of frigid air sweeps away the ashes.</p>\n<p>Dick Grayson is alone.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BATCHAT</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (06:34pm):</strong> hey Dick, we done? i\u2019m tired of watching Felicia and Peter argue</p>\n<p><strong>Tim (06:45pm):</strong> Dick?</p>\n<p><strong>Dick (06:57pm):</strong> Tony\u2019s dead.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Tony doesn\u2019t appear all at once. It isn\u2019t anything so kind as that. No, he comes back from <em>dust.</em> He doesn\u2019t realize what\u2019s happening until his head is fully formed (and my, won\u2019t <em>that</em> be a fun horror to go over later), and the rest of him starts to follow. It\u2019s slow. It\u2019s painful. It leaves him gasping in pain. And he\u2019s coming back right where he left. It isn\u2019t just Nat and Steve anymore. It\u2019s all of the Avengers--what\u2019s left of them--gathered around him. All of them pale and horrified by what they\u2019re seeing play out in front of them. </p>\n<p>\u201cTony--\u201d Rhodey says. He\u2019s never <em>seen</em> Rhodey so shaken before. It hurts to know he\u2019s caused that, even by accident. \u201cJesus, how do we help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hurts,</em>\u201d Tony rasps, clapping a half formed arm on Rhodey\u2019s arm. Rhodey steadies him, clearly unsure of where or how to hold him. \u201cHoly <em>shit</em>, that hurts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone get medical here <em>now</em>,\u201d Steve orders. Tony hears Clint say <em>\u2018On it, Cap!\u2019</em> and then pounding footsteps down the hall. </p>\n<p>\u201cHold me until the rest of my legs get back--\u201d Tony says. </p>\n<p>Steve, Rhodey, and Nat all grab and hold him in place. He clenches his jaw as his lower half comes back, and staggers away from all three of them. He moves drunkenly, like a newborn calf, stiff legged and unsure of his own balance. He stumbles over to the nearest chair and drops onto it hard, breathing harder, trembling, and covered in a thin sheen of sweat. Jesus, is this what Peter went through when he came back? That thought makes him sick.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony, what happened?\u201d Nat asks, kneeling down near his chair. She pauses, frowns, and adds. \u201cYour reactor is gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I gave it to Pete,\u201d Tony says hollowly. His eyes are focusing on nothing; his attention is fully drawn inward as he takes in the events of the past night. Dimensional travel. Peter is alive. His promise.</p>\n<p>That statement causes the others to share a brief and highly concerned look with one another. </p>\n<p>\u201cTony,\u201d Rhodey says slowly. \u201cPeter\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. He\u2019s not dead. He\u2019s in another dimension. Strange sent him there. That\u2019s why Peter died after everyone else,\u201d Tony says. He pushes himself up onto trembling legs. Rhodey steadies him. God, he doesn\u2019t deserve Rhodey. \u201cThat\u2019s where Loki came from. Peter was in trouble so he came here to get me. FRIDAY, spool up the lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn it, Boss,\u201d the AI replies above their heads.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to go to medical, Tony,\u201d Steve says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I need to get to work,\u201d Tony retorts. There\u2019s a fire in his gaze now, one that\u2019s been missing since they lost the war. \u201cYou can either help me or get out of my way, Rogers. Pick one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve watches him for a moment, and then moves to the other side of Tony, helping Rhodey steady him. Tony lets out a sigh of relief. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Onward, noble steeds, and whatnot. Get me to the lab. I\u2019ve got a few dimension hopping suits to build.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mind is blue. Kept blank and dull until needed. He sits in the darkness of an alley in a place called Gotham, hidden and unnaturally still. He has a mission: steal a prototype energy source from Wayne Technology, and he\u2019s waiting until the building is empty of the night watchmen and janitors before making his move. It\u2019s a mission he\u2019s failed at more than once. He\u2019s been stopped each time by a figure wearing a bat symbol. The figure\u2019s shape and voice and color changes, but it\u2019s always the bat. The fights that follow are draws, at best. He never presses an advantage against the Bats (and he has plenty; he\u2019s stronger and faster than them), and therefore he never wins. </p>\n<p>The smallest one did stab him with a sword though, and that was annoying. In the kid\u2019s defense, he had been beating on the man with blue wings across his chest pretty badly that time. He can\u2019t remember why. The blue had overtaken him, demanding obedience. He had been helpless to fight it.</p>\n<p>The blue follows him, chasing at his thoughts, chewing them apart before he can think clearly. Feeding into a simmering rage beneath the blue that pulses in time with his heartbeat.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>They\u2019ve brainwashed you,</em>\u201d the Winter Soldier says. His voice is bitter and heartbroken.</p>\n<p>They. The Black Order. Thanos. The last name is enough to make him tremble inside. He isn\u2019t sure why. Memories of pain and flashes of jewels follow the name. He isn\u2019t sure what he was before, but he\u2019s now a member of the Black Order, and wears the gold-black armor of the Order with--well. Not pride. Never pride. Acceptance, perhaps.</p>\n<p>He was something else before. Someone else. They\u2019re still there, he knows, but he can\u2019t tell through this unending shade of blue that overtakes his mind. Frustration begins to build, and with it, anger. <em>Rage.</em> Green tinted fury wound through with sadness and horror. There\u2019s someone past the blue, someone that used to be him that\u2019s still there.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost there. He can almost <em>think</em> of himself. But his <em>name</em>. He doesn\u2019t know that, and it falls apart like shattered glass.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Your name is Peter Parker,</em>\u201d the sorcerer says quietly. Something gold and red flashes in his view for a moment; arcane sigils thrumming with power. \u201c<em>And you are being controlled.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The sorcerer is a ghost. One of many that follows him around. They each speak to him and he ignores all of them. They\u2019re nothing more than static on an old phone line; echoes of something passing by. Radio interference that disrupts the peaceful sea of blue that muffles his mind. They\u2019ve been there since he woke up in that horrible machine, speaking to him, haunting him, needling at his mind. He knows if he mentions them to Thanos or any of the Black Order members, they\u2019ll make the ghosts disappear.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t mention them. The ghosts have counted this as a victory, judging by how frequently they speak to him now. He isn\u2019t sure about that, but he does like to listen to them. He feels less alone when they talk to him.</p>\n<p>The Black Order has made him one of their own. But they haven\u2019t given him a name. He needs that. He had one before--</p>\n<p>Before what?</p>\n<p>A wave of blue muffles any answer his own mind can conceive of.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Your name is Peter Parker,</em>\u201d the sorcerer says again. Another flash of those strange symbols.</p>\n<p>Peter, then. That\u2019s a good name. He hears it in his dreams sometimes where he\u2019s home with a family he doesn\u2019t remember. A woman. One named after the spring.</p>\n<p>The memory is almost there. He can smell date loaf bread baking, hear her humming an off key song to herself while she bustles in the kitchen. He tenses, his breath hitching, and he starts to come out of the crouch that has him hidden in the shadows. May. Aunt M--</p>\n<p>A wave of blue, sharper and stronger than before, flashes over his vision, blinding him and burning him at the same time, as if someone has driven flaming ice picks into his temples and scrambled his brain.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dammit, he almost had it that time,</em>\u201d the Falcon says.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Give him a moment to recover,</em>\u201d the sorcerer says.</p>\n<p>He comes back to himself slowly, cringing and holding his temples through the strange material of his mask. Gradually, the pain pulls away, drawing back like the tide, leaving smooth thoughts of blue in its wake.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What do you remember?</em>\u201d the sorcerer asks.</p>\n<p>His mind is blue. He has a mission. His name is Peter Parker.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It worked,</em>\u201d the soldier says, shocked and happy and envious.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It did,</em>\u201d the sorcerer replies. \u201c<em>To some degree, at least.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter ignores them. The last of the janitors is leaving the parking lot of the office building. He braces himself, then launches himself at the Wayne Technology building, crawling up the side of it smoothly, quickly, listening to the rain and wind, wary of being interrupted on his mission. He hears nothing, but that\u2019s no guarantee that he\u2019s alone. The guardians of this city are clever and cunning. He\u2019s worked against them for months now. </p>\n<p>So his life goes. Command. Mission. Objective. Results. He\u2019s good at what he does. He knows this because the Black Order hasn\u2019t tossed him back into the machine with the green liquid. The Lazarus Machine. The thing that brought him back from the dead and gave him ghosts for his trouble. He doesn\u2019t want to go back there.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u2019s not quite what happened,</em>\u201d the panther king says. His tone is always kind when he speaks with Peter; even and gentle and with a touch of sadness. The sadness bothers Peter, irritates him on some base level of his being that he strains against. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My name is T\u2019Challa,</em>\u201d the panther king--T\u2019Challa says. \u201c<em>Dr. Strange is the sorcerer. Bucky is the soldier. Sam is the Falcon. There are others with us. You know them, too.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>A wave of information hits him, breaking the surface of that endless <em>blue</em> inside his mind like pebbles in a pond. Names, faces, memories, voices, they all appear in his mind. He pauses mid movement, blinking up at the Gotham night sky as he absorbs it all. He waits for more, and nothing comes.</p>\n<p>Names, then. He has those, at least. </p>\n<p>He also has a mission. Peter resumes crawling up the side of Wayne Technologies, skittering up to the roof and then crawling inside the HVAC system and into the vents that cross the building. He moves easily through the dark and dusty vents until he finds the lab on the 30th floor. He drops into the dark lab, landing on silent feet.</p>\n<p>The dark lab is flooded with light in an instant, blinding Peter. He senses moving behind him and barely dodges out of the way of a crippling blow, leaping away and whirling around to face his assailant in one smooth movement.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, I almost had you that time. You\u2019re quick on your feet,\u201d a friendly voice says in a conversational tone. It\u2019s the man in the black suit with the blue phoenix on his chest. \u201c Give it a few years and your knees are going to start clicking if you do that a lot, though. Trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter backs away from him, watching him warily.</p>\n<p>The man continues to speak with him, still in that conversational tone, though his eyes never leave Peter. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been introduced yet. I\u2019m Nightwing. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stares at him in response, shifting uneasily, tapping his hand restlessly against his thigh. He says nothing. Nightwing doesn\u2019t seem surprised by this. His eyes briefly snap to Peter\u2019s hand, but other than that, he acts as if they\u2019re having a friendly little conversation in the park.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty weird for someone to break into the same place over and over again,\u201d Nightwing says. \u201cYou know whatever you\u2019re looking for is gone, right? It was moved after your first break in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter says nothing. He knows this, but the Black Order doesn\u2019t. And he follows their commands. To the letter. And he doesn\u2019t correct them when those commands are foolish. If they\u2019re commands are a bit more foolish because they trust him, then that\u2019s all the better.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo knowing that, and knowing that you aren\u2019t a complete idiot, you\u2019re breaking in here for another reason,\u201d Nightwing says. They circle one another like dogs. Peter crouched in a fighting stance, Nightwing loose and graceful, holding escrima sticks in both hands. Sparks of electricity flicker from the tips of the sticks. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s because you keep giving your bosses bad information.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a dangerous thing for the blue in his mind to hear. Peter launches himself at Nightwing, swinging for his head and chest. Not killing blows; just strong enough to draw a grunt or two out of the man. But he uses his enhanced speed, covering the ground between them quicker than Nightwing can react, and the punch is coming in too strong. He shifts his weight and punches the pillar behind Nightwing\u2019s head instead. It cracks beneath the pressure.</p>\n<p>Nightwing braces himself against the cracked pillar and kicks Peter back and away from himself with both heels. Peter flies back with a hissing grunt.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve obviously been holding back when you fight us,\u201d Nightwing says. \u201cRemember when you fought Red Robin? It was last week. You had him trapped and dead to rights, but all you did was give him a black eye and then run away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Robin. Peter remembers him, and the staff he used, their brief moment of struggling over the weapon before he pulled it out of Red Robin\u2019s hands and whacked him over the head with it before tossing it aside and fleeing into the night. Not exactly the most epic fight he\u2019s had with the Bats, but--</p>\n<p>But, well. The ghosts had been distracting him during it.</p>\n<p>Just like Nightwing is distracting him now. The man takes Peter down in a sudden tackle. They go down together in a pile of limbs, wrestling and struggling against one another. Peter gains the upper hand and pins him to the floor, gripping Nightwing\u2019s wrists in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe heard you tapping the staff while you fought. He didn\u2019t catch the whole message, not right away, but he knows Morse code when he hears it,\u201d Nightwing continues, struggling against Peter\u2019s strength. Peter could end it here. He could break the man\u2019s arms and crush his neck--</p>\n<p>No. He doesn\u2019t kill. Not even the blue can make him forget that. <em>He doesn\u2019t kill.</em></p>\n<p>He stares at Nightwing from behind his mask, eyes narrowing in time with his frown. He says nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou kept saying three words,\u201d Nightwing continues, his voice strained. \u201c<em>Controlled-hurt-help.</em> The same message you just tapped out to me on your leg.\u201d</p>\n<p>The escrima sticks crack until Peter\u2019s hands. Nightwing tries to throw Peter off of himself and utterly fails; Peter\u2019s too strong. All he succeeds in doing is wrenching his own shoulder and arm in Peter\u2019s grip. Peter feels the man\u2019s tendons and bones stretch to their breaking point and leaps back from him, letting go before the man breaks his own arm in his struggle to get free and flings the broken sticks to the side.</p>\n<p>One of the broken sticks, the end still sparking, lands in a paper recycling box. Smoke rises, flames soon follow. Peter stares at the flaming recycling box, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Nightwing mutters. The flames are spreading with alarming speed; from the trash can, to the computers, to carpet, and then to the lab proper. Smoke rises, hovering near the sprinkler system above.</p>\n<p>The sprinklers let out a half hearted mist and then shut off, utterly failing to do anything worthwhile to the fire and flame.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, who even built this place? How did this pass the fire inspection?\u201d Nightwing asks, horrified. The flames have covered half the room now and show no indication of stopping or slowing down. </p>\n<p>Peter knows a loss when he sees one. He sprints for the nearest window and shoulders his way through it. It\u2019s supposed to be thick, shatterproof glass, but it can\u2019t stand against his strength. He breaks through it and swings himself over to the side, sticking to the building\u2019s exterior.</p>\n<p>Wind rushes inside the building, feeding the flames, and they expand with a sudden roar and flare that has Nightwing staggering in the smoke. He trips over a burning chair and falls through the window, catching himself on the window edge, gritting his teeth. He knows he won\u2019t find purchase, and he doesn\u2019t have enough time to reach for his grappling hook gun. Not that he would be able to use it with his wrenched shoulder. He tries anyway, grimacing in pain and desperate. He falls.</p>\n<p>Without thinking, Peter snaps his hand out and grabs Nightwing\u2019s good arm, careful of his own strength. He swings them towards another building nearby, one lower than their current battleground, and sets the man down with a gentleness that seems instinctive, helping him sit up against the wall connected to the roof entrance.</p>\n<p>Nightwing lets out a little laugh. \u201cOkay. If I had any doubts before, I don\u2019t now. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks at him, and then tilts his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019m sorry about what I\u2019m about to do. You\u2019ll thank me later,\u201d Nightwing says. </p>\n<p>He pulls something out of his utility belt, a small spray bottle. And then he sprays it directly into Peter\u2019s nose and mouth through the mask. The mask is fabric, thin and porous, because the Black Order didn\u2019t trust him with metal armor. Whatever the chemical is, it passes right through the fabric easily. </p>\n<p>He becomes woozy in an instant, staggering back and away from Nightwing with a choking cough. The ground tilts beneath him, and his mind becomes fuzzy. He stumbles and falls onto his side, blearily staring at Nightwing. Nightwing stands and walks over to him, kneeling down beside him and gripping his shoulder in a comforting manner.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy. It\u2019s just a sedative,\u201d Nightwing says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help you, okay? I promise we won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter struggles against the chemical agent, refusing to sleep. Panic starts to claim him--</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You can trust him,</em>\u201d Sam Wilson says.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>We\u2019ll protect you if they try to hurt you,\u201d</em> Bucky adds.</p>\n<p>Peter can sense the ghosts a bit more now. He relaxes and lets sleep take him.</p>\n<p>Life at Wayne Manor is interesting. It\u2019s comfortable, warm, and Peter never goes hungry. In fact, Alfred just seems to <em>appear</em> beside him with a sandwich or a steaming bowl of soup more often than not. It\u2019s enough to keep him fed and full. Peter gets along with the family, of course. Even Bruce, who seems distant and distracted at the best of times, completely at odds with his playboy reputation.</p>\n<p>The only problem is his sleep and his temper. His room is too comfortable, too warm, and his bed is too soft. Peter tosses and turns more often than not, wishing that he could get away with crawling up into the nearest corner to sleep on the ceiling. He can\u2019t, of course. Alfred keeps early hours and Peter isn\u2019t eager to explain that particular habit if he can help it. So he tosses, turns, and grumbles in his massive, too soft bed. Eventually his perpetual frustration gives way and he starts to relax. He\u2019s just started to drift off when he senses someone standing beside his bed.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Hey,</em>\" an unfamiliar voice says above him. \"<em>You're wearing my shirt</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Peter pauses, then slowly opens one eye. A teenager about his age is standing above him, surrounded by a gentle golden glow. The kid could be Superman\u2019s son; he has the same dark hair, the same eyes, even the same face shape. It takes Peter a moment to realize the kid is a <em>ghost,</em> and when he does, he groans in frustration.</p>\n<p>\"Are you <em>kidding</em> me,\" Peter mutters.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Wait, are we at Wayne manor?</em>\" the kid asks, looking around. \"<em>Holy shit, we are.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Peter yanks the blankets over his bead and lets out a frustrated groan. \"Please shut up and let me sleep.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>What?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"I have to go to a <em>gala</em> tomorrow. It's going to be awkward since it's being thrown in honor of my own death. I don\u2019t <em>want</em> to go, but every time I even <em>look</em> at the door, Dick shows up and shoos me back to bed since I\u2019m technically recovering from pneumonia,\u201d Peter says from beneath the blankets. His words are muffled by the fabric. \u201cI am tired. Please be a ghost somewhere else.\"</p>\n<p>An awkward pause follows that. \"<em>I'm new to being a ghost and don't have anyone else to haunt. Could you talk to Tim for me?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Peter freezes, then yanks the blankets down to squint at the ghost. \"How do you know Tim?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>He's my best friend.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Incorrect, I am.\"</p>\n<p>The two teens glower at one another.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Can I slap you as a ghost?</em>\" the teen asks after a moment.</p>\n<p>\"Why would I tell you that?\" Peter retorts.</p>\n<p>The kid shrugs in response, glances around Peter\u2019s room for a moment and then focuses on him again. </p>\n<p>\"<em>Why am I haunting you, by the way?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"I have the Soul Stone,\" Peter says. \"It's like a vacuum cleaner for lost souls killed before their time.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Whoa.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it sucks,\u201d Peter says. He glances at the clock on his nightstand. Thirty minutes after midnight. He\u2019s supposed to wake up for his suit fitting at five. Great. \u201cAren't there other ghosts for you to talk to?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>I can see some, but they're kind of fuzzy and really far. They keep trying to talk to me, I think.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Do me a favor and walk towards them or whatever light you see,\" Peter says, flopping over and yanking the blankets over his head.</p>\n<p>The room falls into a peaceful silence for a long moment.</p>\n<p>\"<em>I'm Conner, by the way,</em>\" the kid says.</p>\n<p>Conner. That name is familiar. He\u2019s overheard Tim mention him before. Peter squints. \"Wait. Tim's been looking for you.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Can you please tell him I'm dead and that I need his help?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Peter covers his face in his hands. This, somehow, has become even <em>more</em> awkward. </p>\n<p>\"No. I am <em>not</em> waking up my best friend to tell him his friend is dead. Not when he hasn\u2019t been sleeping well and <em>definitely</em> not when I have no proof other than '<em>hey, the voices in my head told me your best friend is dead, his restless spirit popped up in my room last night and threatened to slap me</em>.'\u201d Peter says this with an exaggerated voice and even more exaggerated hand motions. He huffs and then glances at Conner. \u201cEveryone in this place already thinks I'm one step away from a catastrophic and potentially very violent breakdown. I don\u2019t need to end up in Arkham Asylum, thanks.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>He's in danger,</em>\" Conner insists.</p>\n<p>\"Then I'll protect him.\"</p>\n<p>Even in the darkness, Peter can feel Conner's disbelieving look.</p>\n<p>\"<em>If you tell him now--</em>\"</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s had enough. A renewed wave of anger sweeps over him, intermingling with his exhaustion and shortening his temper. \"I said no. Go away.\"</p>\n<p>He puts some strength behind his words. There\u2019s a flash of gold, and then silence. Peter tugs down the blankets and looks around his room.</p>\n<p>Empty. Quiet. Peaceful. </p>\n<p>He sighs and flops back into bed. He's asleep in moments.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>His peace lasts into the morning and ends the moment he steps out of the shower, pulls on his boxers, and starts to brush his teeth. He\u2019s just decided that less than four hours of sleep is, perhaps, not ideal when Conner appears behind him in a golden flash of light.</p>\n<p>\"<em>That was really rude, you know</em>,\" Conner says behind him.</p>\n<p>Peter startles, jumping up to cling to the ceiling out of pure instinct. He also makes a distinctly undignified noise, fumbling for his toothbrush and barely catching it in time. He stares at Conner in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Conner stares up at him curiously. \"<em>How are you sticking to the wall like that?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Because I\u2019m Spider-Man. And <em>dude.</em> You can\u2019t just appear behind people like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Why not?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m in the bathroom. That\u2019s weird. There are <em>rules</em>, okay? You can haunt me literally anywhere else, but <em>not</em> the bathroom,\u201d Peter says, crawling back down from the wall and adjusting his towel. \"None of the other ghosts pop into the bathroom, so this is distinctly a you problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>None of the other ghosts are trying to save their friend's life</em>,\" Conner counters. \"<em>Everyone here is in danger. He's going to hit the gala and kill his family and everyone else within reach.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Who is?\"</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Superman</em>,\u201d Conner says. \u201c<em>He killed me and now he\u2019s going to kill everyone else.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter freezes in place.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Looks like I finally got your attention</em>,\u201d Conner mutters. \u201c<em>Come on, we need to talk to Tim--</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\"No, I need a suit,\u201d Peter says, setting down his toothbrush. \u201cAnd web fluid. And, preferably, a utility belt from Batman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Conner stares at him. \u201c<em>No, we need to talk to Tim. Or Dick or Duke or literally anyone--</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter ignores him, walking past the ghost. He\u2019s been working on a new suit, of course, but progress has been slow. Alfred cleans his room once a day, and Peter has been having significant trouble hiding his sewing supplies and suit material from him. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You aren\u2019t even listening to me, are you?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, obviously not,\u201d Peter replies. A suit. He needs a suit--</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>We can get you a suit from the cave downstairs</em>,\u201d Conner says, annoyed. </p>\n<p>Peter stops and turns to face Conner. \u201cThe what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Follow me</em>,\u201d Conner says.</p>\n<p>Peter stares after the ghost as he slips through Peter\u2019s door and into the hallway. After a moment, he follows him down the hall towards a closet. The door opens easily. The false wall in the back of the closet slides open easier than that. Peter finds himself looking down a steep set of stairs leading into a shadowy light that smells of water, rock, and electronics. Conner\u2019s ghost walks down the steps. Peter follows, his mind a blur.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Bruce meant for you to find this</em>,\u201d Conner says idly, looking around the cave. \u201c<em>He doesn\u2019t just leave entrances like this open.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would he want me to find this?\u201d Peter asks, looking around at the cave. There\u2019s a giant penny in the back, a massive T-rex model, the sound of rushing water and---</p>\n<p>And suits. A lot of them. All of them belong to the Bats. Peter stops at the bottom of the stairs. Why the <em>hell</em> does Bruce Wayne have a cave full of Batman\u2019s suits? He takes another look and amends that statement: Bruce has more than just Batman\u2019s suits down here. He has Nightwing\u2019s, Red Hood\u2019s, and--</p>\n<p>And his. A sleek, red and black spider suit stands at the end of the row.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Probably because he wants you to join the family business</em>,\u201d Conner says dryly. \u201c<em>There\u2019s your suit, now can we please go tell literally anyone else in this house--</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Red Hood says. He\u2019s standing near a bank of computers at one end of the cave, facing Peter from behind his mask. </p>\n<p>Peter and Red Hood stare at each other for a long moment. Conner stares at both of them.</p>\n<p>\"You really shouldn't be down here, kid,\" Red Hood finally says.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I\u2019m just grabbing something,\" Peter says. </p>\n<p>Red Hood lets out a frustrated sigh that turns into a furious growl when Peter approaches the glass case holding the spider suit. Peter opens the case and sighs, locking eyes with Conner in the reflection.</p>\n<p>\"Back me up here, man,\" Peter says, grabbing the suit. He puts just a tiny bit of force into his words.</p>\n<p>Conner fades into existence, outlined in gold, standing between Peter and Red Hood.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Red Hood repeats, a bit more hysterically this time.</p>\n<p>\"<em>He's Spider-Man</em>,\" Conner says. \"<em>Jason, we need your help</em>.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wait, <em>Jason?</em>\" Peter asks, turning around as he shrugs on the suit. He squints at Red Hood, and recognition hits him. Red Hood is Jason Todd. \"What the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Right back at you, asshole,\u201d Red Hood retorts, storming over to him. \u201cI thought you were <em>dead </em>this whole time--\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>We don't have time for this. Superman is coming to kill everyone in this house</em>,\" Conner says. \u201c<em>He\u2019s going to start with Lois and Jon, his family. They\u2019re coming to the gala. They might already be here.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason stops. He facepalms. He\u2019s silent for a long moment before saying, very quietly, \"Of course he is. I hate this family so fucking much.\"</p>\n<p>\"Save it for therapy, Red, I need your help,\" Peter says, pulling on the mask. The suit and mask are snug, obviously made to fit Peter when he was underfed and starving in the streets. The material stretches against the muscle mass he\u2019s managed to build up since coming to the manor. \"We don't have much time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Right, sure. Whatever. This might as well happen.\" He sounds like he\u2019s one step away from having a breakdown. He points an accusing finger at Peter. \u201cI cannot <em>believe</em> you let me think you were dead. You are <em>such</em> an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when we\u2019re done here, you and Nightwing can take turns yelling at me,\u201d Peter replies. He tests the web shooters on his wrists. \u201cConner, how much time do we have?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fifteen minutes, maybe</em>,\u201d Conner says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can work with that,\u201d Peter replies.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>* * *</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The plan isn\u2019t exactly complicated; Jason is going to find Batman, Nightwing, Red Robin, Signal, and anyone else he can find to help. Peter is going to take on Superman and hold him back long enough for back up to arrive. He crawls along the outside of the manor, frustrated by the cold, the party going on inside, his lack of sleep, and the whole situation. He wants to rest. He wants to eat. He wants to throttle Jason for hiding his identity, and he wants to talk to Dick and Nightwing both. But right now, he needs to stop Superman. Conner had said Superman is being controlled, that his eyes were flashing with an unnatural blue color when he dusted Conner in his bedroom. Peter isn\u2019t sure what to make of that.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It means he\u2019s been hit with an Infinity Stone,\u201d</em> Nick Fury says. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s spoken to Peter in weeks. He sounds distant, his voice muffled. \u201c<em>Hawkeye had the same problem until Black Widow fixed him.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d she do that?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>She hit him in the head really goddamn hard.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you telling me the Avengers saved Clint Barton using Looney Tunes logic,\u201d Peter hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>If it\u2019s stupid, but it works...\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Fair enough. From what Peter understands, Superman is just like Captain America. There are two rules for fighting Captain America: go for the legs, and keep your distance. The general understanding is that if you\u2019re within arm\u2019s reach of Cap, you\u2019ve already lost. Peter is fast, and he\u2019s strong, and he\u2019s clever. He managed to surprise Cap back in Germany, he might be able to do the same to Superman. Who is just like Cap. </p>\n<p>Except he can fly. And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And, actually, he might be stronger than Cap, now that Peter thinks of it. </p>\n<p>This might be more difficult than originally planned. Peter shifts in the shadows, suddenly glad that the strength he lost while living in the fire station has come back with a vengeance. He\u2019ll need every ounce of it to keep Superman from hurting everyone in the gala.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that Bruce Wayne keeps idly wandering out to the balcony below Peter, holding a glass of champagne. Despite the man\u2019s focus on the distant silhouette of Gotham City, Peter has the unnerving feeling that Bruce can see him as clear as day. Which is impossible; he\u2019s tucked in against the shadows of the manor. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh, he totally knows you\u2019re here</em>,\u201d Conner says.</p>\n<p>Literally how--</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Over the city!\u201d</em> Conner snaps. \u201c<em>He\u2019s coming in fast!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Peter almost doesn\u2019t catch sight of Superman in time. He\u2019s speeding across the air, flying towards an oblivious Bruce Wayne who is, even now, turning to face the shadows Peter\u2019s hiding within. Peter braces himself against the wall, throws himself into a deep swing and kick, flying past Bruce Wayne. Peter times it with Conner\u2019s help. He swings for a blur of blue and red. putting as much weight and strength into the kick that he can. His heel catches Superman\u2019s jaw, slamming him through the plate glass window leading into the ballroom with enough force to send him careening into the wall on the other side of the room. Superman lands with an annoyed, frustrated growl and pulls himself out of the shattered wood and plaster slowly, his eyes glowing red.</p>\n<p>On anyone else, that kick would have obliterated their skull like an overripe watermelon. For Superman, it just pissed him off. Peter swings through the broken window, flinging himself up onto the ceiling. He scans the startled, terrified crowd and finds the people Conner showed him. </p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Lane, get your son and <em>get out!</em> <em>Now!</em>\u201d Peter calls out. His suit doesn\u2019t have a voice modulator like his old one, and his voice comes out clear, Queens accent and all.</p>\n<p>He sees Duke, Tim, and Damian Wayne snap their heads up towards him at the sound of his voice. Of course they recognize it; he <em>lives</em> with them. He curses, but decides to deal with that later.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone, <em>get the hell outta here!</em>\u201d Peter says, swinging for Superman. If he aims this kick just right, he might be able to knock some sense back into Superman--</p>\n<p>Superman clamps his hands around Peter\u2019s neck the moment Peter gets within arm\u2019s reach of the man, eyes still glowing that baleful red color. Peter knows Superman is fighting against whatever is controlling him due to two simple facts: if Superman truly wanted Peter dead, he would\u2019ve crushed Peter\u2019s head between his palms and obliterated what was left of him with his laser eye beams. He hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s still strangling Peter, but it isn\u2019t a deathblow yet.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s literally no way for Peter to hit him in the head. So he does the next best thing: he kicks Superman in the stomach as hard as he can with both feet. He\u2019s still enhanced, and his legs are the strongest parts of his body. Even a near demigod is going to feel that. </p>\n<p>Judging by the wheezing gasp and startled look on Superman\u2019s face, Peter\u2019s right. Superman drops his hands away from Peter\u2019s neck, staggering back a half step. And then he slaps Peter, apparently too winded to throw a decent punch.</p>\n<p>In the end, it\u2019s the slap that makes Peter\u2019s temper snap. It\u2019s utterly inconsequential, more insulting than painful, but it sends Peter into a red frenzy. When Superman tries to grab his neck again for another round of strangling, Peter catches both of his forearms in a crushing grip and promptly slams his forehead against the man\u2019s nose. He does it three times in quick succession, each one more violent than the last, before bodily flinging Superman across the empty ballroom floor and through a marble pillar. The pillar crumbles like wet sand, and a much more docile Superman pulls himself out of the rubble, hand held to his head. His eyes are no longer glowing an eerie blue or simmering red. They look normal.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You did it,</em>\u201d Conner starts. \u201c<em>Man, you\u2019re strong--\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Peter is too lost in his rage to hear him. He sprints across the marble floor, flinging out two thick strands of webbing on the remaining pillars, yanking back against them before using them as a slingshot to fly towards Superman. The man barely realizes he\u2019s under attack before Peter slams into him and tackles him to the ground. </p>\n<p>He starts to punch. He\u2019s not holding back. Each strike bounces Superman\u2019s head off of the floor, sending a spider web of cracks crawling across the smooth stone.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Kid, that\u2019s enough--</em>\u201d Sam starts, alarmed.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe cannot hear you,\u201d</em> Mantis says. \u201c<em>He\u2019s too angry. I can\u2019t calm him.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Peter isn\u2019t sure how many punches he lands before two sets of arms grab him and haul him away from Superman. He struggles against their grip, too startled to put real strength behind it.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, that\u2019s enough!\u201d Nightwing yells in his ear, struggling to haul Peter away from Superman.</p>\n<p>Nightwing?</p>\n<p>\u201cGet a hold of yourself!\u201d Jason snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s the Pit Madness! Snap out of it!\u201d</p>\n<p>The---what? Peter stops fighting them, breathing hard and trembling with suppressed fury. He takes in a deep breath, letting them haul him back and away. The anger starts to drain away, leaving behind an odd hollow, exhaustion. He looks around and finds himself the center of attention. Nightwing and Red Hood each have a hold of his arms. Tim and Duke are staring at him in shock. Bruce is helping Superman stand up, but he keeps a wary eye on Peter as he does so. The rest of the guests have, wisely, run for the hills.</p>\n<p>Peter raises his arms in surrender, then yanks off his suit mask, reaching up to touch the ring of bruises on his throat. Nightwing and Red Hood stand back from him, watching him warily. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nightwing says. \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replies, sitting down hard. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the far corner of the Milky Way, a ship passes through stars. It moves at a speed faster than light, but not quite as fast as Tony would like. </p>\n<p>They have enough to get home. That\u2019s not what bothers Tony.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the fact that Carol--apparently a new recruit for the Avengers--left before he could ask her any important questions and <em>hasn\u2019t come back yet.</em> She simply appeared in front of the ship, glowing like the sun and hauling two massive crates along behind her, said she was going to make sure no one was following them, and then left.</p>\n<p>And hasn\u2019t been back since. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s been weeks. Maybe <em>months.</em> He can\u2019t tell; everything looks the same inside this ship. It\u2019s like being in an isolation cell in prison. Except that he has Blue nearby; not a huge talker, that one, but she\u2019s warming up to his neurotic tendencies. Which is a good thing; if she takes a dislike to him, she could easily fling him out of the airlock. Fortunately, he\u2019s managed to charm her, though God alone only knows how.</p>\n<p>He grabs a tasteless meal bar from the supplies Carol brought them and wanders over to the cockpit. Blue--<em>Nebula</em>--looks up at him as he approaches and offers a slight nod of greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replies. \u201cAll of the fueling platforms within range are derelict. I suspect most of them exploded when the Snap occurred since there was no one around to maintain safety protocols. Space fuel under pressure is extremely volatile.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. That makes sense, but it\u2019s still disappointing. \u201cSo, no shortcuts home, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. We do have enough standard fuel to make the trip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how long will that take?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m unfamiliar with your solar system and the Benatar does not have the astrography calculations for---\u201d</p>\n<p>He recognizes that urge to over explain. Another hot coal of fury is added to the simmering rage he holds for Thanos. Tony raises his hand. \u201cBallpark it for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fortunately, she\u2019s (somehow) familiar with that phrase. She simplifies her response: \u201cWe\u2019ll arrive within the next six Earth months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sighs, waving a hand over one of the consoles to bring up a map of the galaxy. It\u2019s not news he wanted to hear, but it\u2019s the news he\u2019s got. Six more months of wondering if anyone is still left alive on Earth. Thanos snapped away half of the <em>universe</em>; that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean half of all life on every single planet. He could have easily wiped out entire planets and left others intact. It\u2019s all up to blind luck and chance. </p>\n<p>\u201cSix months of freeze dried potatoes and beef paste it is, then,\u201d Tony says, idly tracing out theoretical paths through the stars. None of them are any quicker than the path Nebula chose for them, but he\u2019s nosy and bored and needs to fidget in a semi-productive way. \u201cWhich is about the only palatable food left in that crate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI enjoy the ice cream,\u201d Nebula says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can have all of mine, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nebula perks up slightly. She doesn\u2019t give him suspicious side long looks when he gives her something anymore, but seeing her excitement is almost worse in some ways. He resolves to take her by one of the good ice cream places in New York when they get back. There\u2019s one that Peter dragged him to once that--</p>\n<p>He shuts that thought down before it can fully take hold and focuses on the map in front of him instead. He traces out a path past a few binary star systems, and a massive black hole. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if we--\u201d he starts.</p>\n<p>A flash of golden light appears in front of the ship, bright enough to shoot blades of light through the metal shutters over the cockpit windows and illuminate the cockpit. Tony has a brief moment of panic that resolves into hope (Carol arrived in much the same way, after all) and then utter confusion.</p>\n<p>The light fades. Something hits the front of the ship with a hard, echoing <em>thwump.</em> For a moment, he and Nebula stare at each other before she cautiously raises the metal shutter over the window in front of her and peers through it. The angle is such that Tony can\u2019t see what she\u2019s seeing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you hit?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cA child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stares at her. \u201cYou...ran over a kid? In space?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>She checks her console. \u201cAt top speed. He is remarkably intact.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony moves over to her seat and looks over her shoulder. And stares. </p>\n<p>Pressed against their window is the body of a teenager. A <em>huge</em> teenager--one that looks like he could rival Cap for size and muscle alone--but a regular human teenager nonetheless. He\u2019s wearing sneakers, jeans, and a black shirt with a red <em>S</em> across the chest. His face, arms, and--well, every bit of exposed skin is black and blue from bruises. Fresh ones from the look of it, too. It looks like someone took a tire iron to the kid before flinging him out into space.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fu--\u201d</p>\n<p>The kid\u2019s eyes snap open. He gasps, clutching at his throat. Tony forgets his confusion and summons his suit. It\u2019s not entirely spaceworthy at the moment, but it should be good for a quick EVA. The nanites roll out and over his skin, sealing up tight just as he floats into space and along the outside of the ship. For a moment, the old fear and phobia hits him, and he has to fight off distant memories of the Battle of New York as he reaches out and grabs the kid. By the time he wrestles the kid inside, the worst of the fear is gone.</p>\n<p>The kid gasps, coughs, and groans in pain. And Tony is sure that he\u2019s not fully human, despite how he looks. Humans pass out in seconds in space; the lack of oxygen and pressure plays merry hell on organs meant to survive in Earth\u2019s gravity. The kid is somehow still conscious.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy, kid, take it slow,\u201d Tony says, drawing the suit back before kneeling down beside the kid. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhere--\u201d the kid starts, his voice raspy and confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpace. The far side of it, actually. If one wanted to be charitable, you could almost call it the <em>ass end</em> of space, in fact,\u201d Tony says. He offers the kid a hand up. \u201cI\u2019m Tony. The pilot up front is Nebula. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConner,\u201d the kid says, taking Tony\u2019s hand. He doesn\u2019t need help to get back onto his own feet, but he accepts the offered hand anyway and stands on his own two feet. \u201cConner Kent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Conner, you\u2019re lucky we ran you over. How\u2019d you end up here?\u201d </p>\n<p>If there\u2019s another ship nearby, one hostile enough to beat the shit out of a teenager before flinging him into the cold void of space, then Tony would like to know that. First, so he can return the favor on whoever hurt this guy, and second, so he can steal their fuel supplies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was--a fight,\u201d Conner says haltingly, as if trying to piece together his own memories. \u201cI was in Gotham.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a ship?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>Conner shakes his head. \u201cA city. On Earth.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, that\u2019s weird, seeing as I\u2019m <em>from</em> Earth and have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about. What was happening in Gotham?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA fight. A <em>big</em> fight--it\u2019d have to be big if the Bats were calling for help. Red Robin called out to me for help. Some new hero had gone insane. They needed help containing him,\u201d Conner says. He winces. \u201cHe was stronger than we were ready for. <em>Way</em> stronger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony, well and truly lost, decides to just roll with this. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that new guy had super strength, given your bruises.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, does he ever,\u201d Conner mutters, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cAnd he could <em>stick</em> to things, too. Crawl or run up walls like gravity doesn\u2019t apply to him. That\u2019s not a <em>huge</em> deal, but it is when he can duck into a crevice somewhere and blind you with webs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony goes very, very still. \u201cWebs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Conner says. He tugs at a splotch of half frozen webbing on his sleeve, making a face. \u201cI really hope this stuff doesn\u2019t come out of that guy.\u201d He sighs. \u201cThe new guy threw a bus at me--an empty one, thank god--and then he hit me with a glob of that webbing before jumping me. The weirdest part--before I ended up <em>here</em> anyway--was that he was begging for <em>help</em> the entire time. Have you ever been beaten up by someone <em>asking for help?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, I have not,\u201d Tony says stiffly. \u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA big orange flash, some guy with a goatee and a cape appeared in front of me and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I have to send you to another dimension. I\u2019m doing this to save your life. When you meet the man in the metal suit, tell him everything\u2019 and then I ended up plastered to the front of your ship,\u201d Conner says, shrugging. He pauses. \u201cI guess you\u2019re the guy with the metal suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Strange is still alive, then. Or alive enough to throw teenagers through portals. Tony\u2019s mind is going a mile a minute. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. Did you catch the name of the guy who beat you up? The one with the webs?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious, but he wants to be sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing and Red Robin called him Spider-Man,\u201d Conner says.</p>\n<p>Tony lets out an explosive breath, closes his eyes, and then opens them again, focusing on Conner. \u201cOnce you\u2019re rested, we\u2019re going to discuss all of that again. Okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>Which is remarkably patient for him. Tony wants to grill this kid nonstop for every detail of this other dimension. He wants to know how Strange is alive. He wants to know if this Spider-Man is <em>his</em> Spider-Man or just another universe\u2019s version of him. He wants to know <em>everything.</em></p>\n<p>But Conner is hurt, confused, and surprisingly resistant to explosive decompression. He probably needs to rest.</p>\n<p>Hell, the kid was just literally shot out of the only reality he\u2019s ever known and ended up in an entirely different one. He\u2019s probably going to have some reaction to <em>that</em>, too. Tony would be a mess, personally. More of a mess, at least. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, sure,\u201d Conner says, rubbing his eyes. </p>\n<p>When Tony wakes up, it\u2019s to the sound of strange machines, rattling chains, and the sharp, arrogant tones of Ebony Maw giving orders. It takes him a moment to put together the chain of events that\u2019s yanked him into this situation and when he does, he fights back a curse. The ship had been taken, yanked inside another ship they hadn\u2019t seen on their sensors. He and Nebula had fled the ship, ready to do battle--and come face to face with an entire <em>army</em> of outriders. All things being equal, they had given it their all, but the outcome was inevitable: a flock of the damn things separated him from Nebula and tackled him straight into a portal and here.</p>\n<p>Wherever <em>here</em> is. It\u2019s Earth, he knows that much. The few stars he can see from the spire look the same, at least. The fact that he can occasionally hear distant police sirens, gunshots, and traffic also adds weight to that theory. No Stark satellite network though; he would\u2019ve seen one or two crossing the sky by now. They might have been lost to the invasion, or simply fallen out of the sky when half his workforce collapsed into dust and ash.</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s in a different place, alone, and being held prisoner by the Black Order.</p>\n<p>He is, to put it lightly, screwed.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s chained up inside some fucked up tower in the middle of a city he doesn\u2019t know, unable to reach the arc reactor hidden beneath his shirt. Worse, he\u2019s in the custody of the Black Order. Ebony Maw is alive (somehow), apparently in the middle of organizing an invasion. He stands in the middle of the spire, glowering down at a computer console. </p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s Iron Spider suit sits on the floor behind him, battered and scuffed, but still whole from what Tony can see. He wants to get to that suit badly; Nebula had left it behind on Titan, more worried about Tony\u2019s fatal wound than any souvenirs from their battle against her father. Tony had resolved to go back to Titan for it, but it looks like Ebony Maw got to it first. Jackass.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d an unfamiliar voice says beside him. There\u2019s a strain to it, a grogginess that Tony knows all too well. The guy either has a concussion or a bruised jaw. Possibly both.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see my reputation precedes me,\u201d Tony says, his voice hoarse until he clears his throat. He turns to face the new guy and winces. \u201cThey did a number on you, pal.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man is in a black and blue super suit, one that almost looks like something Tony would design himself. There are a few differences here and there, things that tug at the edges of his memory before he shakes it off. What <em>does</em> catch his eye is the Avengers <em>A</em> stenciled on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d the man says, grunting in pain. Bruises cover his face and neck, fresh and old alike. \u201cFancy meeting you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds annoyed. As if they\u2019ve already met.</p>\n<p>One of Cap\u2019s people, then.</p>\n<p>Great.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know me,\u201d Tony says, eyes roaming the interior of the spire with an increasing amount of frustration. Magic. He never liked magic. Nuclear radiation kills you dead, but at least it has <em>rules.</em> Magic functions on fairy farts, from what Tony can tell. No hard rules, nothing to contain the power. That\u2019s always rubbed him the wrong way. \u201cAlways looking for a new experience or three. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool name. Way better than Hawkeye. I\u2019m starting to wonder about Cap\u2019s obsession with bird people, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him a confused look. \u201cCap?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gives him one right back. \u201cYeah. Captain America? You know, the ultimate boy scout? Sanctimonious asshole with the blue supersuit? Carries a shield around with a giant star on it? Or he used to, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever met him,\u201d Nightwing says, an odd tone to his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve seen someone draw a few pictures of him though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, you aren\u2019t missing much,\u201d Tony replies. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do they have you strung up like this?\u201d Nightwing asks.</p>\n<p>Tony lets out a huff. \u201cBecause I broke their portal when I went through it and they\u2019re trying to get me to fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know how their own machines work?\u201d Nightwing asks, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the tall guy in the middle of the room, Ebony Maw, <em>used</em> to know. Until I killed him. Turns out there are side effects to being killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing peers at Ebony Maw. \u201cLooks like he got better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, next time I\u2019ll take Peter\u2019s suggestion and add \u2018blow a hole in his goddamn head\u2019 to the last step,\u201d Tony mutters. Nightwing turns a sharp glance his way and he shrugs. \u201cNevermind. Not important.\u201d</p>\n<p>He drops his voice when he sees a swarm of winged outriders fly down the top of the spire, heading towards Tony and Nightwing. \u201cShit. They brought kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing looks up and sucks in a breath, growing tense inside the chains that are binding him. The outriders bring three teenage boys over to their little corner, tossing all three to the magical chains dangling around them. Each chain shoots out and rapidly cocoons one of the boys. Two fight back, nearly breaking free before being yanked back into their half formed cocoons: a black haired kid with blue eyes that carries a runner\u2019s build beneath an extremely well tailored suit and a dark skinned boy with a bright yellow jacket over motorcycle riding leathers. The last one doesn\u2019t even flinch: the chains capture him, leaving him to hang inside the cocoon, almost bonelessly. There\u2019s something oddly familiar about that one.</p>\n<p>Nightwing clenches his jaw. The other two boys curse and struggle. The kid in the yellow jacket manages a vicious kick to one of the outriders before it flies off, sending him into a dangling twirl that makes him turn slowly on the chain. The other boy, the one in the suit, is staring at Tony. Hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Tony asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d the kid says, staring at him closely. It\u2019s a hard stare, one full of suspicion, and Tony is a little unnerved by the intensity behind it. \u201cDuke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good, Tim,\u201d the kid in yellow says, grumbling. \u201cThey were waiting for me--\u201d</p>\n<p>He finally turns all the way around and sees Tony. His eyes go wide and he stumbles to a stop mid sentence before glancing over at the third kid. Or, actually, <em>around</em> the other kid. Tony follows his gaze and wonders what the hell he\u2019s seeing. And hearing. Duke tilts his head, as if he\u2019s listening to something that isn\u2019t there. Maybe he\u2019s enhanced? He might be able to hear Ebony Maw from here if that\u2019s the case.</p>\n<p>The third kid shifts in his chains, groaning as he lifts his head up. He coughs, and mutters, \u201cWha--\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sucks in a breath. That voice is entirely too familiar, and brings with it a wave of memories he isn\u2019t ready to confront just yet. A trick? Or just bad luck. Sometimes people have similar voices--</p>\n<p>\u201cTony?\u201d the kid says, his voice wavering. \u201cIs that really you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know me?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d the kid says. And it\u2019s <em>almost</em> convincing. Almost. \u201cIt\u2019s Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t him,\u201d Tony says, voice tight. \u201cThis is a trick. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw Peter die, in front of me, in my <em>arms</em>. I watched him flake apart into <em>dust</em>. Hell, I still have the shirt that\u2019s covered in what\u2019s left of his body, because that\u2019s all I can give his family. <em>You aren\u2019t Peter Parker</em>. You\u2019re something made up to look like him,\u201d Tony says flatly. He glances at the kid and scoffs. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even get his eyes right. And what\u2019s with the dyed hair? The kid wouldn\u2019t do that. Drop the act, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not-Peter looks wounded and frustrated, grinding his teeth as if he\u2019s fighting back a sudden surge of rage. Add that to the list of things that don\u2019t quite fit. Peter has a temper, but he doesn\u2019t switch from an eager explanation to tooth grinding rage like the fucking Hulk just because someone gets snappy with him. Typically, there\u2019s a moment or two of a kicked puppy look before the anger swells up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were saying, Bird Boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing,\u201d Nightwing corrects, his tone odd, as if he\u2019s puzzling through something. He keeps glancing at Not-Peter. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince the storm started,\u201d Tony says in a huff. \u201cGot sucked into a portal and spat out in the middle of all of <em>this</em>. This isn\u2019t the worst torture chamber I\u2019ve been chained up in, but it\u2019s bordering on the most boring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing shoots Not-Peter a look. The other kid, Tim, does the same. Not-Peter fidgets inside his chain prison, something close to a guilty expression crossing his features. He really does look like Peter--in the face, at least. He\u2019s too skinny otherwise, and the hair and eyes are obviously wrong. As far as fakes go, it\u2019s a pretty half assed attempt.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I saw you at a parent teacher conference,\u201d Tim says.</p>\n<p>Tony gives him a baffled look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim shoots Not-Peter a <em>look</em>.</p>\n<p>Not-Peter shrugs. \u201cMagic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuke saw a man with two faces at the school before the attack,\u201d Tim says, half under his breath. He glances at Nightwing. The two share some kind of unspoken conversation between each other--it\u2019s downright eerie, really. Tony\u2019s only ever seen that kind of thing play out between Clint and Nat. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t <em>actually</em> Tony Stark, was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Not-Peter admits, taking in a deep breath and slowly gaining control of himself again. \u201cIt was--it was someone else doing me a favor.\u201d He pauses, scrunches up his face and adds, \u201cKind of. It\u2019s complicated. They were one of my, uh, ghosts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if you were really the kid, you\u2019d know Nat\u2019s first rule for lying: \u2018keep it simple, stupid.\u2019 No one\u2019s gonna buy that ghost line,\u201d Tony says. Not-Peter fights back another swell of rage and Tony scoffs. \u201cYeah, calm it down, Hulk Junior.\u201d</p>\n<p>A voice suddenly shouts near Tony\u2019s ear, almost as clear as day, frustration laced across every syllable: \u201c<em>Man, will you shut the hell up and </em>listen<em>?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Tony starts, glancing over his shoulder as much as he can. He sees nothing but brick and cement, twisted out of place, but empty of any living soul. He frowns, twisting around to look over his other shoulder. Still nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid...anyone else hear that?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was Sam,\u201d Duke says. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty annoyed with you right now. So are the rest of Peter\u2019s ghosts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony frowns at him, fighting off confusion, frustration, and a rapidly growing headache. He wants to spout off some sharp retort about the existence of ghosts, but he can\u2019t quite shake off an eerie feeling of being watched by someone behind him. That voice was <em>definitely</em> Sam Wilson\u2019s. A trick, maybe? Ebony Maw might have someone like Wanda on his team--</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do I have to do to prove it to you?\u201d Not-Peter says, frustration threading his words.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot sure that you can,\u201d Tony quips, still glancing behind himself warily.</p>\n<p>Not-Peter seethes, looking around the spire. In the middle of the room, the Black Order is talking amongst themselves, plotting out their upcoming invasion. Tony strains his hearing, trying to listen in. He misses his suit; his hearing isn\u2019t what used to be; years of head pounding rock, loud parties, and then flying through the upper atmosphere have done a number on that particular sense. Usually FRIDAY can help, but well--</p>\n<p>She\u2019s trapped both inside the Iron Spider across the room from him and in the arc reactor pressed against the center of his chest. Tony shifts inside his chain prison, gradually pulling his hand a bit closer to the arc reactor. If he can just get his hand over another few inches--</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one. The one in yellow,\u201d Ebony Maw says, pointing at the little group, and Duke in particular. \u201cHe isn\u2019t like the others. We can use him--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you really have to go and do this on a <em>Friday?\u201d</em> Not-Peter calls out, interrupting him. His focus is set on the center platform, and the Iron Spider pod in particular.</p>\n<p>The Iron Spider\u2019s case flashes to life, the standard blue-white of all Stark technology flashes twice. Once to acknowledge Peter\u2019s voice, and once to show readiness for further commands from its user. Tony put FRIDAY into that suit; even a perfect mimic can\u2019t fool her. She\u2019s dialed in on Peter\u2019s DNA. She won\u2019t activate for anyone <em>but</em> Peter and Tony.</p>\n<p>It <em>is</em> Peter.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Shit.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Tony snaps his head back to Peter, his heart pounding in his ears. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You,</em>\u201d Ebony Maw says, focused on Peter now instead of Duke. \u201cYou should be <em>dead.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Ebony Maw makes a sharp motion with his hand, yanking Peter down towards his platform. The kid gives Tony a panicked, guilty look that is so painfully <em>Peter Parker</em> that Tony feels his stomach drop. The expression disappears once he gets closer to Ebony Maw, replaced by false bravado that Tony can see right through.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a roaring sound in Tony\u2019s ears, muffling Peter\u2019s entirely too confident words and Ebony Maw\u2019s sharp, impatient replies. When one of the eerily glowing green vats rises, fills with swirling black dust, and births out a half mad outrider, Tony begins to piece things together himself. When Peter shrinks back from the vat, his eyes becoming guarded and terrified, he makes the connections. He feels himself go pale and becomes dizzy, sees Nightwing clench his jaw tighter.</p>\n<p>That is an <em>ugly</em> way to come back to life.</p>\n<p>Horror gives way to fury, cold and sharp. He can work with that. </p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the count of three, I\u2019m going to break out of these chains and go help the kid. Will you help me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nightwing says. He says it so quickly that Tony can barely finish his sentence. Tony\u2019s regard for the hero rachets up a tiny bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. One, two--\u201d He wrenches his hand over, ignoring the sharp pain in his shoulder when he does so. He presses his palm against the arc reactor, and feels the nanobots swarm out to build his suit, encasing him in the strongest and most advanced suit he\u2019s ever made. When the helmet forms, FRIDAY greets him with the five custom HUDs he needs to pilot the suit. His voice comes out with the distinctive Iron Man echo.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p>"
