  "text": "<p>It starts when Uncle Four starts coughing. They don't think much of it. People get ill sometimes. Wen Qing is able to give him medicinal tea and it never progresses beyond sniffles and a cough. It passes from person to person in their small settlement, never staying long, never making anyone so sick they need to do anything more than drink Wen Qing's tea and nap for a couple of afternoons. The cultivators amongst them don't get ill at all.</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian falls sick, he just stays in his cave \"inventing\" for a couple of days. It's nothing unusual. No one but Wen Ning and Wen Qing even notice.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan gets ill a few days after Wei Wuxian gets better. He gets sicker than the rest, but Wen Qing assures them that this is normal because of his age. Wei Wuxian spends hours telling him stories and holding him while he sleeps.</p>\n<p>It's while A-Yuan is asleep on his chest that Wei Wuxian notices his breathing has become more labored, can feel his little body grow warmer.</p>\n<p>He gets up without putting A-Yuan down and moves to the entrance of the cave.</p>\n<p>\"Wen Qing,\" he calls. A-Yuan doesn't so much as stir.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\" she demands.</p>\n<p>\"I think he's gotten worse,\" he says.</p>\n<p>She frowns and checks his pulse, his temperature, and listens to his breathing. \"Go back inside. I'll get a poultice for the breathing and more tea.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods and does as he's told. It's not long before Wen Qing returns with the promised items. The poultice doesn't smell very good, but Wei Wuxian doesn't complain. They wake A-Yuan up enough for him to drink the tea. For the first time, he doesn't make faces at the taste, just drinks, then lets his head fall back to Wei Wuxian's shoulder and sleeps.</p>\n<p>\"Let me know if there's any change,\" Wen Qing instructs.</p>\n<p>Things seem like they're improving and then A-Yuan's fever spikes. After that, neither of them leave A-Yuan for more time than it takes to get water or relieve themselves. Wen Ning fetches them fresh water and anything else his sister might need, but no matter what she tries, nothing helps bring down A-Yuan's fever for long.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Wuxian,\" she says as dawn starts to break. \"I don't have the things we need to help him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll go to Yiling,\" Wei Wuxian says immediately. \"Buy whatever it is.\"</p>\n<p>She shakes her head, mouth pressed together in a thin line. \"The doctor in Yiling would not have what is needed to treat this. Only a cultivation clan would have everything necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian freezes. Yunmeng is closest, but he can't take this to Jiang Cheng. He knows he can't. There are plenty of smaller clans relatively nearby, but all of them hate and fear him, never mind that A-Yuan is a Wen. None would even let him in the door to beg his case.</p>\n<p>There is only one option.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will take him to Gusu,\" Wei Wuxian says and gets up to start preparing to leave. \"Lan Zhan likes A-Yuan. If nothing else, he would help.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Wuxian,\" Wen Qing says. \"What if he's not there? The Lans\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"Would not turn away a sick child,\" Wei Wuxian insists. \"Even if I am the one who brings him. Unless you think\u2013\" Wei Wuxian stops and swallows hard. \"Unless you think he couldn't make it to Gusu.\"</p>\n<p>She shakes her head immediately. \"If you follow my instructions exactly, he will make it.\"</p>\n<p>\"You should come,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"Make sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then who will be here in case something happens? A-Ning wouldn't know what to do,\" she replies. \"And don't suggest I go by myself, that would be stupid. I'll go prepare a bag with everything you'll need.\"</p>\n<p>With that, she whirls out of the cave.</p>\n<p>\"We'll get you better, A-Yuan. Whatever it takes,\" Wei Wuxian promises the snuffling, sleeping form of the little boy huddled under the blankets on his bed. He throws stacks of talismans and anything he can think of that might be useful in a qiankun pouch. Wen Qing returns shortly thereafter with Granny and Wen Ning behind her.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tries to stay out of their way, to give them some time with him, but Granny calls for him and tugs him close.</p>\n<p>\"Take care of him,\" she says.</p>\n<p>\"I will give up my life before I let anything happen to him,\" he vows.</p>\n<p>\"Of course,\" she says and pats his cheek. \"He is your child.\"</p>\n<p>\"Granny,\" he starts, but she puts two fingers over his lips.</p>\n<p>\"Hush,\" she says. \"We all know it to be true. Just remember to take care of yourself, too. He's already lost one father. Don't make him lose another.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can't speak around the lump in his throat, so he nods and hugs back when Granny embraces him. Wen Ning runs his hand over A-Yuan's small head, then steps back.</p>\n<p>\"If anything happens, I'll be counting on you to protect everyone, Wen Ning,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"I will,\" Wen Ning promises.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian claps him on the shoulder and leans down when Granny tugs on him. She puts a loop of fabric over his head and he recognizes it as the sling she uses to hold A-Yuan when he gets tired. Wen Qing lifts him from the bed and helps get him situated while giving him her instructions on how to take care of A-Yuan until they get to Gusu. Wen Ning tucks the remaining supplies into his qiankun bag.</p>\n<p>\"If the weather takes a turn for the worse, please stop somewhere. Rain or wind would do him no good. Even if you have to pay for a room at an inn.\" Wen Qing says, fussing with the fabric holding A-Yuan and the blanket he's wrapped in. Wen Qing suggesting he <em>spend</em> money only drives home how serious she is about it. \"Don't do anything stupid. Send word when you arrive.\"</p>\n<p>He nods. \"I will.\"</p>\n<p>\"Go,\" she says. \"Be swift.\"</p>\n<p>He nods again, reaches to make sure Chenqing is in its spot on his belt, and heads out into the late afternoon sun. At least the weather is still relatively warm. He won't have to worry about the cold.</p>\n<p>He makes his way down the hill. He pauses just outside the wards to make sure there are no gaps, that the Wens will be as safe and protected as possible while he is away, and then he's off.</p>\n<p>He pushes hard, pausing only to take care of A-Yuan per Wen Qing's instructions, then moving again. He loses track of time completely. He stops only once when he's so tired he knows if he goes much longer, he'll start getting disoriented. He finds them an empty, falling-down shack and sleeps for a few hours before setting off again.</p>\n<p>His exhaustion is starting to overcome him again when he reaches a town late in the evening. It's large enough to still have some activity in the streets, despite the lateness. It takes him nearly falling into the river bisecting the place to realize this isn't just <em>any</em> town. This is Caiyi Town.</p>\n<p>\"We're almost there, little man,\" Wei Wuxian breathes and kisses the top of A-Yuan's head. \"Just a little bit further.\"</p>\n<p>He takes a swig of water and lets himself catch his breath before setting out again. He's so close, it would be stupid to stop now. He can make it. He knows he can make it.</p>\n<p>He almost regrets the decision when he gets to the base of the mountain upon which the Cloud Recesses sit, but he presses on.</p>\n<p>\"Wonder if the fact that normal people would have a harder time getting up here is by design or a happy accident,\" he grouses.</p>\n<p>There's a constant ache in his chest from missing Suibian, but now it pulses. He'd have <em>been</em> here by now. A-Yuan would have already been receiving proper treatment for at least a day.</p>\n<p>Stil, he puts one foot in front of the next and keeps climbing.</p>\n<p>It feels like the top will never come, like he'll be climbing until he dies. This was much easier when he was fifteen\u2013for too many reasons to count.</p>\n<p>He nearly cries when he sees the light of the lanterns hanging at the gates of the Cloud Recesses. He allows himself a single moment of relief before the reality that now he has to talk his way in hits him.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck,\" he breathes. His only hope is getting them to go get Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian doesn't even know if he's actually <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>\"Good evening, pilgrim,\" one of the guards says. \"Please state your business.\"</p>\n<p>\"I come seeking aid,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"I have a very sick child.\"</p>\n<p>\"Step further into the light,\" another guard with a much less friendly voice says. He tugs the sling back so A-Yuan's head is visible and does as he's told.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Wuxian!\" the unfriendly guard shouts and both guards draw their swords.</p>\n<p>Every instinct is screaming for Wei Wuxian to grab Chenqing. He takes a deep breath instead. \"Yes. I come only to beg for aid for my child.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why should we believe you?\" the first, unfriendly guard asks.</p>\n<p><em>Because you're not already dead</em>, he does not say even though he wants to more than anything.</p>\n<p>\"Because he is here in my arms and obviously sick,\" Wei Wuxian replies through gritted teeth. \"And if you think me so dangerous, go get Hanguang-Jun. Let him be the judge.\"</p>\n<p>They confer for a moment. \"Hanguang-Jun is asleep. Why should we wake him for the likes of you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because he has shown fondness for this child in the past and he would be upset with you for delaying. I will submit to whatever he chooses to do with me once he's here,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"Fine,\" the grumpy one says. \"But if you so much as breathe in the wrong direction, I'm sounding the alarm.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods. He keeps both hands where they can be seen and does not move except to press a kiss to A-Yuan's still too warm forehead.</p>\n<p>It feels like hours, or maybe several years, pass before he hears the sound of the gate opening.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying?\" Lan Wangji asks. He looks different. It takes Wei Wuxian an embarrassingly long moment of staring to realize it's because his hair isn't up in a headpiece. His forehead ribbon is, notably, still firmly in place.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says, suddenly feeling heavy and sluggish. \"Lan Zhan, please. He's sick. We didn't have the things needed to treat him and I couldn't think of anywhere else to go. I will beg if I must. I have no pride where A-Yuan is concerned.\"</p>\n<p>To his horror, he feels his eyes burn and he sways on his feet.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying!\" Lan Wangji gasps and suddenly he's very close and he puts an arm around his shoulders to steady him. \"You need not beg. We will help.\"</p>\n<p>The relief at those words is so great, Wei Wuxian feels like a puppet whose strings have been cut. He made it. The Lans will help.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>When he went to bed earlier, Lan Wangji certainly did not expect to be woken up well before morning by a frantic guard proclaiming that the Yiling Patriarch was at the gates demanding to see him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Wei Ying. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He dresses quickly and as they walk, he manages to get more information out of the guard.</p>\n<p>\"He claims he has a sick child with him, but it's probably a trick,\" Zhang San says. \"Why would there be a child with him and his army?\"</p>\n<p>\"Have you been to Yiling?\" Lan Wangji asks. \"Have you seen his army?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well...no,\" Zhang San replies.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I have,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"This army you speak of is less than fifty people, largely old men who could not fight, and women. They were healers before the Sunshot Campaign. The child's name is A-Yuan. Do not make judgements based on unfounded rumors.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Hanguang-Jun,\" Zhang San says quietly. \"Sorry, Hanguang-Jun.\"</p>\n<p>The rest of the walk is silent and not nearly fast enough. Finally, the gates come into view and he waves a hand to open them. There Wei Ying stands, A-Yuan held tightly in his arms. He looks beyond exhausted and rough in ways Lan Wangji hoped to never see again after the Sunshot Campaign.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying?\" he says. Wei Wuxian looks up at him, stares for several long moments, then he blinks.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan. Lan Zhan, please,\" Wei Wuxian says, voice hoarse. \"He's sick. We didn't have the things needed to treat him and I couldn't think of anywhere else to go. I will beg if I must. I have no pride where A-Yuan is concerned.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows hard and watches as Wei Wuxian's eyes go glassy and then he sways on his feet.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying!\" Lan Wangji dashes forward and wraps an arm around Wei Wuxian's shoulders. \"Wei Ying, you need not beg. We will help.\"</p>\n<p>The relief that floods Wei Wuxian's eyes at that almost overwhelms him. It clearly overwhelms Wei Wuxian because his knees give out a bit and it takes Lan Wangji a moment to get him steady again.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, Lan Zhan,\" he says. \"I haven't slept in...a while.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fetch the doctor,\" Lan Wangji orders. \"We will meet him at the medical pavilion.\"</p>\n<p>He keeps his arm around Wei Wuxian as they make their way through the Cloud Recesses. The little boy in his arms is alarmingly still and silent, so unlike the way he was in Yiling. Lan Wangji hates it.</p>\n<p>He wonders how long it's been since Wei Wuxian ate properly or slept. He doesn't have his sword, so he must have traveled on foot, which is a journey of at least four days.</p>\n<p>\"Why did you not ride Suibian?\" Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>\"Please don't ask me, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian replies. He sounds, impossibly, even more tired than he already had. \"Anything else. Not that.\"</p>\n<p>\"All right,\" Lan Wangji replies softly. There's something off in that response. Before, when asked about Suibian, Wei Wuxian has reacted with anger, with defiance. He will let it be, for now. \"Are there others who fell ill?\"</p>\n<p>\"We all caught it. Well, not the cultivators, but everyone else got a cough and some sniffles. A few afternoon naps and it was gone,\" Wei Wuxian replies around a big yawn. \"But not for A-Yuan. It got worse and then became what you see now.\"</p>\n<p>The implication being that Wei Wuxian is <em>not</em> a cultivator, Lan Wangji realizes with dawning horror. Which would also explain why he can't ride Suibian. He is clearly too tired to properly censor himself. Lan Wangji swallows and voices none of this.</p>\n<p>\"How long has he been ill?\" Lan Wangji asks instead.</p>\n<p>\"Over a week, now,\" he replies, then whines, \"Lan Zhan, why is the medical pavilion so far?\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not that far,\" Lan Wangji says. \"You are merely very tired.\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose. Better than back with those two at the gates. They were ready to fight me, even though I was clearly carrying a child,\" he says. \"I'm probably lucky they even bothered to get you.\"</p>\n<p>\"But they did, so while they are young and foolish, they are not hopeless,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>\"What time is it, anyway? I woke you up. I'm sorry,\" he sounds genuinely contrite and Lan Wangji wants to shake him.</p>\n<p>\"It is fine,\" he replies and turns them down a short path to the medical pavilion building.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lays A-Yuan down on a bed and Lan Wangji watches him fuss with the blankets and push his hair back out of his face.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says. \"He will be fine now. The doctor will be here in a moment.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows visibly and nods. \"Thank you for...I knew we could count on you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying\u2013\"</p>\n<p>The clan doctor clears his throat at the doorway just then and he watches Wei Wuxian scramble up to bow to him. Lan Wangji bows beside him.</p>\n<p>\"Doctor,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi,\" the doctor greets. Wei Wuxian doesn't recognize him, but that doesn't really mean much. He doesn't recognize a lot of people he's met.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry to disturb you so late, but my...A-Yuan. He's so sick. I have a letter from Wen Qing detailing the treatments she was able to give and her diagnosis.\" Wei Wuxian reaches into his sleeve and hands the doctor the letter.</p>\n<p>The doctor reads it over quickly and moves forward toward the bed where A-Yuan is curled up. Wei Wuxian's entire demeanor changes in an instant. He goes stiff with tension and his hand moves to Chenqing. It occurs to him that since A-Yuan was taken from the Jin prison camp, it's very likely that Lan Wangji himself is the only stranger who has been allowed anywhere near A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says and wraps a hand gently around his wrist. \"I would not allow anyone to touch him if I did not trust them. I trust Lan Simiao.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" Wei Wuxian replies and Lan Wangji can feel him forcing himself to relax, to take his hand away from his flute. \"I know. I just\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi, all I see here is a sick child. I will treat him with as much care as I did our Lan Wangji when he was a boy,\" the doctor says without looking up from his examination of A-Yuan. \"You have nothing to fear from me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry,\" Wei Wuxian says and takes a breath. \"And thank you.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn't move away, doesn't release his grip. He watches Wei Wuxian close his eyes and take slow, deep breaths.</p>\n<p>After a thorough examination that probably doesn't take as long as it feels like it does, the doctor finally looks up. \"Wen-daifu was correct in her assessment, as expected. He will make a full recovery if we begin treatment immediately.\"</p>\n<p>\"May I stay?\" Wei Wuxian asks immediately</p>\n<p>\"If you can manage to keep out of the way,\" the doctor replies.</p>\n<p>\"You should get some rest,\" Lan Wangji suggests and squeezes his wrist slightly.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shakes his head. \"I'll stay.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's eyes bore into Wei Wuxian's, and he stares back.</p>\n<p>And then Wei Ying sways on his feet again.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying!\" he says once again, and slides an arm around him.</p>\n<p>\"'M fine,\" he replies, voice muffled in the fabric over Lan Wangji's shoulder. \"Just not used to being upright without him anymore.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying, you <em>must</em> sleep,\" Lan Wangji says, feeling slightly desperate.</p>\n<p>\"I can't leave him,\" Wei Wuxian insists, shaking his head. \"Lan Zhan, I can't.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"It is no use, Hanguang-Jun,\" the doctor says. \"You will never convince a parent to leave their sick child.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"Lying is not permitted in the Cloud Recesses, young man,\" the doctor says tartly. \"He may not be yours by blood, but anyone with eyes can see he is yours in every other way and I've known you for less time than it would take to eat a meal.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows audibly, and after a moment he lifts his eyes to look at Lan Wangji. There's an odd look of guilt there which Lan Wangji can't hope to decipher the cause of. He's known since that day in Yiling. Since Wei Ying's ridiculous joke that was only a joke insofar as the physical aspects of it went. The truth of it was shining bright in his eyes, in every action, every interaction with A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>\"I will fetch a few things to make you more comfortable here,\" Lan Wangji says, and turns his gaze to the doctor, \"If that is all right with you?\"</p>\n<p>\"As long as my medical pavilion remains quiet apart from the child,\" the doctor agrees. Lan Wangji nods and leads Wei Wuxian to a mat he found and placed near A-Yuan's bed.</p>\n<p>\"I'll be back,\" he promises.</p>\n<p>\"With food?\" Wei Wuxian asks hopefully.</p>\n<p>\"And a bath and clean clothing,\" Lan Wangji promises.</p>\n<p>\"You really are the best,\" Wei Wuxian says, eyes shining with gratitude.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods at him, then the doctor, and slips out into the night again. Food, a bath, and a clean change of clothing is the bare minimum of courtesy, yet clearly Wei Wuxian does not expect more, not even from Lan Wangji whom he once called his soulmate.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows and gathers everything he needs as swiftly as he can. Lan Wangji catches the two who were at the gates when Wei Wuxian arrived as the guard changes and presses them into service helping him. He knows he's being petty, but it's late and he's tired and despite Wei Wuxian's outwardly flippant attitude, Lan Wangji knows they upset him. They can have their sleep delayed longer in order to make Wei Ying more comfortable.</p>\n<p>The likelihood of finding any food to Wei Ying's taste at this time of night is slim, but he does his best to put together a meal that won't actively repulse him.</p>\n<p>He takes the tray back to the medical pavilion. Wei Wuxian is kneeling next to the bed and running his hand gently over A-Yuan's hair. His eyes snap immediately toward Lan Wangji and then he visibly relaxes.</p>\n<p>\"I have food,\" Lan Wangji offers.</p>\n<p>\"I feel simultaneously like I'm starving and like eating even a bite might make me nauseous,\" he says. \"I suppose that means your bland Gusu food may actually be just the thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji responds and sets the tray on the low table next to the bed. He stares at Wei Wuxian until he sighs, reaches for the bowl of congee, and takes a bite.</p>\n<p>While he eats, Lan Wangji goes into another room and lays out the clean clothes and towel. The guards arrive with the tub and hot water a few moments later. Once it's set up and the tub is full, he returns to the main room.</p>\n<p>The doctor comes back into the room with a tray of his own. It's clearly full of various treatments for A-Yuan, and he starts administering them with Wei Wuxian's assistance.</p>\n<p>\"The last is a poultice for his chest, but he should be bathed and clean before I put it on,\" the doctor says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods and shoots Lan Wangji an apologetic little smile. \"I guess A-Yuan gets the nice bath you arranged first.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will get you fresh water,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"You don't need to,\" Wei Wuxian dismisses. Lan Wangji doesn't bother responding. He will, of course, regardless of anything Wei Wuxian might say.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sweeps A-Yuan up into his arms and carries him into the other room. The doctor hands him some small, child-sized underrobes, then Lan Wangji follows.</p>\n<p>\"He's going to be so sad to have slept through this,\" Wei Wuxian murmurs as he strips A-Yuan of his dirty, worn, and slightly too-small clothes. \"He loves baths and water. I would have started teaching him to swim already if we were at Lotus Pier.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sounds sadder than Lan Wangji ever wants to hear him sound.</p>\n<p>\"He can have as many baths as he likes when he wakes,\" Lan Wangji promises. The cold pond is not a suitable place to teach a child to swim for any number of reasons, but he would offer it as well if he could.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the tub is deep enough that it will make holding an unconscious A-Yuan and washing him at the same time somewhat complicated.</p>\n<p>\"This is silly,\" Wei Wuxian finally declares and passes A-Yuan to Lan Wangji. \"I'll just get in with him. Kill two birds with one stone.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian starts stripping off his robe. Lan Wangji huffs and turns his head to the side. He hears a soft laugh and then hears the water splash as Wei Wuxian gets in the tub.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, Lan Zhan,\" he says. \"Give him to me.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does as he's asked and steps back, turning his head again.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, what have you been doing since we last saw each other?\" Wei Wuxian asks as he bathes himself and A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>\"Night hunts. Study. Music practice,\" he answers. It's nothing terribly interesting or exciting. Even the night hunts were routine tasks with uninteresting creatures. Nothing that would capture Wei Wuxian's interest. \"You?\"</p>\n<p>\"Working on talismans. Testing Wen Ning's abilities. Playing with this one and getting yelled at by Wen Qing,\" he replies. \"I...had some other visitors. On their way to Lanling for a wedding. It was good to see them.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's voice is thick and Lan Wangji doesn't have to look at his face to picture his expression.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Lan Zhan,\" he says. \"It's...I don't think I can wash my hair and hold him at the same time. Do it for me?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji should offer to take A-Yuan. To let Wei Wuxian finish bathing himself.</p>\n<p>He doesn't.</p>\n<p>\"All right,\" he agrees softly and moves behind Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" Wei Wuxian breathes. \"You don't have to, I was\u2013we can figure something out.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji ignores him and uses a jug to carefully wet his hair. He has to concentrate to keep his hands from trembling as he works soap through Wei Ying's hair.</p>\n<p>It feels impossible that this is the most intimately Lan Wangji has ever touched Wei Wuxian, yet the way his heart is pounding proves otherwise. Now that he's done it, he never wants to <em>stop </em>touching Wei Wuxian like this. He wants, more than almost anything, to have the right to continue. To not need the excuse of a sick child to do so.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is curiously silent through the entire process.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying, have you fallen asleep?\" he whispers.</p>\n<p>\"No, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian replies, voice barely a low rumble. \"Feels nice.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows and rinses Wei Ying's hair before running a comb gently through the strands. The water is going to start cooling soon and A-Yuan needs his poultice, but for a little while it's just them.</p>\n<p>Too soon, Wei Wuxian's hair is clean and tangle free. Lan Wangji forces himself to set the comb aside, to get up and retrieve towels for them.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying smiles at him as Lan Wangji reaches for A-Yuan. He takes the boy in his arms and sets to drying him off and dressing him while Wei Wuxian gets out of the tub. He very carefully does not think about anything else happening in the room behind him. Now is not the time. There may never be a time for it.</p>\n<p>\"It's nice to be clean,\" Wei Wuxian says and steps into his field of vision wearing the darkest robes Lan Wangji could find for him and squeezing his hair with a towel. \"I'm not sure I've been this clean since...before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji hums as he finishes dressing A-Yuan, then wraps him in a warm, soft blanket. He seems so small and fragile like this. When they met, his bright smile, like Wei Wuxian's, filled the area around him. It made him seem so much bigger than his small body.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says softly and leans in to press a kiss to A-Yuan's forehead. Instead of pulling away, he lets his head fall to Lan Wangji's shoulder. \"I don't know what I'd do if\u2013\" He cuts himself off. \"Thank you for letting us in the gates.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes and breathes in, then out again. \"Let's get him back to the doctor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Wei Wuxian replies and goes to collect his things from the abandoned pile of clothes. It's clear he didn't carry much with him, just a single qiankun bag. \"I would say to just burn these clothes, but I probably need them.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will send everything to be washed tomorrow,\" Lan Wangji promises. It's not a lie, but he will also send someone to Caiyi Town with money and instructions to buy some simple, black robes and bring them back.</p>\n<p>They move back into the other room and Lan Wangji carefully lays A-Yuan back down on the bed and steps back to give the doctor access. He and Wei Wuxian both stand back and watch as he applies the poultice to A-Yuan's chest.</p>\n<p>\"Remove this on the hour,\" the doctor says. \"Give him broth at any time you can get him to take it. He's underweight and that won't help him get better.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...is. Is it just because of the illness?\" Wei Wuxian asks. Lan Wangji can see his hands clench on the qiankun bag.</p>\n<p>\"Mostly,\" the doctor replies. \"If he hadn't gotten ill, he would still be in the healthy range, if not exactly where I would usually like to see a boy his age.\"</p>\n<p>\"So...he hasn't been going hungry?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"No, Wei-gongzi,\" the doctor says gently. \"You have done well. How often have <em>you</em> eaten less so he could have his fill, hm?\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks to the side and doesn't answer. Lan Wangji feels his breath catch in his throat.</p>\n<p>\"That's what I thought. Make sure Wei-gongzi eats small meals frequently, Hanguang-Jun,\" the doctor tells him.</p>\n<p>\"I will,\" Lan Wangji promises. Nothing about this is right or fair. It hits him square in the chest that it has <em>never</em> been right or fair.</p>\n<p>\"I will be back in the morning unless you send for me sooner,\" the doctor says.</p>\n<p>\"Goodnight,\" Lan Wangji says and bows to him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian does the same. \"Thank you for helping him.\"</p>\n<p>\"There is no need to thank me for helping a sick child,\" the doctor says. \"I would never have turned him away.\"</p>\n<p>He's gone then, leaving the two of them alone with A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath and lets it out again. \"You should go back to bed, Lan Zhan. I've kept you awake long enough.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head. \"I will stay with you and A-Yuan.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm too tired to argue,\" Wei Wuxian says. He's clearly also too tired to regulate his expression because he looks distinctly relieved.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji retrieves another mat from the cupboard and sets it out as Wei Wuxian sinks down to sit on the floor next to A-Yuan's bed and pulls out a small, colorful stuffed creature. The colors are still bright, despite being well-loved. There's a crinkling sound under his fingers and Wei Wuxian turns it over. There is a folded piece of paper pinned to it.</p>\n<p>He frowns and takes the paper, then tucks the stuffed creature under A-Yuan's arm.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stands at the foot of A-Yuan's bed and watches Wei Wuxian's face as he unfolds the paper and reads what's inside. His expression moves from shock, to a grief so deep it makes Lan Wangji's heart ache, to anger.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck that. I won't do it,\" Wei Wuxian says darkly and throws the letter directly into the fire in the corner of the room.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>For the first time in months, Wei Wuxian feels almost content. Almost happy. A-Yuan is receiving the care he needs to get better and Lan Wangji is with him.</p>\n<p>He sinks to the floor to get A-Yuan's stuffed toy from his bag so he has something comforting and familiar with him if he wakes up and Wei Wuxian isn't right there. When he pulls it from the qiankun pouch there's a crinkle of paper under his fingers. His name is written on top in Wen Qing's neat hand. He unpins the note from the toy and tucks it under A-Yuan's arm before he reads.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Wei Wuxian,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Granny, A-Ning, and I have discussed things and if there is a chance GusuLan Sect would take A-Yuan in, if they would make him a disciple and give him a better life, we would ask that you ensure it happens. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He is so young and he deserves so much more than we can give him here.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Wen Qing</em>\n</p>\n<p>It takes a moment for the shock to pass, but when it does, Wei Wuxian feels a thousand things at once. He wants to scream, to weep until he no longer has any tears left, he wants to burn down the world. He settles for burning the letter.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck that. I won't do it,\" he says and watches with grim satisfaction as the paper bursts into flame.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying?\" Lan Wangi murmurs.</p>\n<p>\"It's nothing, Lan Zhan,\" he says, then sighs. He knows Lan Wangji won't believe him. He doesn't really want him to, but he definitely doesn't want to breathe a word of that letter out loud.</p>\n<p>They're fine. Things aren't perfect, but A-Yuan has both Wei Wuxian and Wen Qing to teach him, he has <em>family</em> who love him, a roof over his head, and enough to eat. Wei Wuxian will go a little hungry every day for the rest of his life if he must.</p>\n<p>He reaches out to brush A-Yuan's hair out of his face and sighs. A moment later, a warm blanket settles around his shoulders. \"Will you sleep now?\" Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>\"I need to remove the poultice,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"I will do it,\" Lan Wangji says. \"Please sleep, Wei Ying.\"</p>\n<p>\"Only if I can use your lap as a pillow,\" Wei Wuxian says before his mind catches up with his mouth. \"Ah, sorry. I know you won't...\"</p>\n<p>He trails off as Lan Wangji settles on the floor at the head of A-Yuan's bed and gestures toward his lap.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks at him.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying, please,\" Lan Wangji says. \"Sleep. I will watch over him and you will be right here.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you insist,\" he says after a long moment.</p>\n<p>\"I do,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows and settles on the floor in front of Lan Wangji. He's so tired. He knows whatever was left of his filter is gone and Lan Wangji has already indulged him far more than he deserves. There are many things he should do in this moment, but he's not very good at doing what he <em>should</em> do even at the best of times.</p>\n<p>Since this is nowhere close to the best of times, he sighs, lies down on his side, and settles his head on Lan Wangji's thigh.</p>\n<p>\"You even sat somewhere you could reach the poultice. You're too good, Hanguang-Jun,\" Wei Wuxian mutters.</p>\n<p>\"Sleep, Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji insists.</p>\n<p>This feels familiar, as if he's done it before. He briefly remembers hard, uneven ground and a deep, quiet voice singing to him before he slips into unconsciousness.</p>\n<p>When he wakes up, his head is resting on a soft pillow. He blinks once then bolts upright. It's light out, but still earlier than he would normally wake on his own. He looks to the side and A-Yuan is exactly where he should be with a fresh poultice on his chest.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reaches out to run a hand gently over A-Yuan's head. \"Good morning, little man,\" he whispers.</p>\n<p>\"Absolutely not,\" he hears from outside at a volume that only barely does not break the Lan Sect rule against raising one's voice in the Cloud Recesses. \"You should not have let him through the gates.\"</p>\n<p>He breathes in, then out again, then in again. He has not had nearly enough sleep to deal with Lan Qiren, but he must. For A-Yuan's sake, he will.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian presses a kiss to A-Yuan's forehead, then stands. He smooths out his borrowed robe and makes sure his hair is in some semblance of order. He nearly tucks Chenqing into his belt as he usually would, but discretion being the better part of valor, he tucks it back into his sleeve again. He takes another deep breath and walks out of the medical pavilion.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren, Lan Xichen, and Lan Wangji are standing a few paces from the door, all wearing serious expressions.</p>\n<p>\"Lan-zongzhu, Lan-xiansheng,\" he greets, bowing first to Lan Xichen, then to Lan Qiren. He does not rise from his bow. He knows his place and it is not as it once was. His days as head disciple of YunmengJiang are long past. \"I beg your forgiveness for arriving unannounced. I would never presume to walk these paths again except in the most dire of circumstances and I would never impose on your hospitality or take advantage of your compassion for my own sake. I am here because a bright and precious four year old boy is very, very sick and would have died if he had gone much longer without proper treatment.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bites down hard on the inside of his cheek and blinks rapidly in an attempt to stave off all the emotions threatening to spill over. They almost <em>lost</em> A-Yuan. If something had happened, if he hadn't been fast enough\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says and tugs him up. He studies Wei Wuxian's face for a moment and his voice drops to a whisper. \"He is doing well, Wei Ying. The doctor says he should wake up soon.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian presses his lips together, breathes in through his nose, and nods tightly, then turns back to Lan Xichen and Lan Qiren. \"I have no money or goods to offer as payment, but I offer my skills to the Lan Sect however you might see fit to use them.\"</p>\n<p>\"You may stay a week,\" Lan Qiren says, voice practically a growl. \"If you step a single toe out of line or interfere with our disciples in any way, you will be removed from the Cloud Recesses.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Lan-xiansheng,\" Wei Wuxian says and bows toward the man. Lan Qiren whirls around and stalks away without a backward glance.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi,\" Lan Xichen says, voice kind as ever as Wei Wuxian straightens up again. \"To turn away a young boy in need of care would be against every principle the Lan Clan holds dear. We would not require anything of you in exchange for treating him. If you find yourself at loose ends while the child is confined to the medical pavilion, we would welcome any talismans you might have time to make, but do not require them.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Zewu-Jun,\" Wei Wuxian says and bows again.</p>\n<p>\"I look forward to meeting Wen Yuan when he is feeling better,\" Lan Xichen says. \"Wangji has told me he's a sweet boy.\"</p>\n<p>\"In the absence of Hanguang-Jun, he is my light,\" Wei Wuxian responds, then wishes he could take the words back. They feel like too much for this early in the morning.</p>\n<p>\"Then it is good indeed that you are here now,\" Lan Xichen says. \"I must take my leave. Wangji, Wei-gongzi, I will see you later.\"</p>\n<p>\"Goodbye, Zewu-Jun,\" Wei Wuxian says and watches him as he walks back down the path away from the medical pavilion.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says, \"Are you\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, if you have blank talisman papers I can use, I'll get started. Which do you think I should make first? Are you low on any?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Wei Ying</em>,\" Lan Wangji says. \"You need to rest.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can rest when he's better,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sighs. \"Would you like some breakfast?\"</p>\n<p>\"Breakfast would be wonderful, Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I will return shortly,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods and returns to A-Yuan's side. He has a little frown on his face and he coughs weakly. Wei Wuxian hates this. A-Yuan should be active. Laughing. Mischievous.</p>\n<p>He swallows and kneels down. There's a basin filled with talisman-warmed water with a cloth hanging over the side of a low table next to the bed. He dips the cloth in the water, wrings it out, and washes A-Yuan's face and hands.</p>\n<p>\"You're going to get better soon,\" Wei Wuxian tells him. \"And then we're going to play every game and I'm going to bury you in every part of the garden, no matter how much Qing-Jie yells at me about it.\"</p>\n<p>The frown disappears from A-Yuan's face, so Wei Wuxian keeps talking. He tells him a very silly story about when he got sick for the first time after coming to Lotus Pier until the doctor returns.</p>\n<p>\"Doctor,\" Wei Wuxian greets and rises to bow to him. \"Thank you for allowing us to disturb your rest last night. It seems like he's already breathing better.\"</p>\n<p>\"He is,\" the doctor confirms. \"I believe he will wake, at least briefly, sometime today. It will take a while before he's able to stay awake for long and his lungs will be weak for longer, but he is already on the mend.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" Wei Wuxian says and bows again. \"I have already promised Zewu-Jun I would make talismans for the sect, but if there is anything I can do for you in particular, please let me know.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am only doing my duty, Wei-gongzi,\" the doctor replies. \"As you were doing yours when you brought him here. Now, I am going to remove the poultice.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods and moves aside so the doctor can work. As Wei Wuxian cleans any remaining residue from the poultice off A-Yuan's chest, Lan Wangji returns with a tray of food. One bowl is significantly redder than the others and Wei Wuxian can't help but smile.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, you really are the best.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just don't forget yourself and give that to the little one,\" the doctor says. \"No need to confuse his body with more fire.\"</p>\n<p>\"He refuses to eat my food anyway,\" Wei Wuxian pouts.</p>\n<p>\"Then he's got a good head on his shoulders,\" the doctor says. \"Do feed him if you can. Congee and broth. Nothing more.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir,\" Wei Wuxian replies.</p>\n<p>\"I will return later,\" the doctor says and leaves Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji alone in the room with A-Yuan as Lan Wangji sets out the food. He places the bowls of broth and congee for A-Yuan to the side.</p>\n<p>\"Are you eating with me, Lan Zhan?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>\"Not that I object to your company, but surely you have better things to do with your time,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" Lan Wangji replies simply.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, so you've been tasked with keeping an eye on me,\" Wei Wuxian says and busies himself with pouring tea so he doesn't have to see the truth in Lan Wangji's eyes.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" Lan Wangji says again, this time with a heavy sigh. \"I am here because I want to be.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's eyes snap to Lan Wangji's. He looks...earnest. Sincere. It makes Wei Wuxian's chest feel tight.</p>\n<p>\"All right, Lan Zhan,\" he says after several long beats.</p>\n<p>They eat. It's almost nice, except this time A-Yuan isn't making Lan Wangji smile. Instead, he's still sleeping, too quiet and too still. Wei Wuxian reaches out and runs the back of his fingers over A-Yuan's soft cheek.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a breath and turns back to the meal. It's just...he's fairly certain his appetite hasn't returned since before <em>he</em> got sick.</p>\n<p>\"Is it not good?\" Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>\"It's wonderful,\" Wei Wuxian replies and lets out a guilty sigh. \"I didn't know you could find food like this in the Cloud Recesses. I'm just. Distracted. I'm sorry.\"</p>\n<p>\"There is no need to apologize,\" Lan Wangji says. \"Eat what you can.\"</p>\n<p>We Wuxian nods and forces himself to take a few more bites. He won't be good for much of anything with the lack of sleep and not enough food combined. He drinks several cups of tea, eyes rarely leaving A-Yuan's face.</p>\n<p>\"Did you bring blank talismans, Lan Zhan?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" he replies. \"And a brush and ink.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good, good. Any thoughts on what I should make?\" We Wixuan asks.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes a few suggestions and as he removes the tray of food, Wei Wuxian settles in to start making talismans. He works most of the day, only pausing when the doctor checks on A-Yuan. He never seems to run out of ink. He doesn't think a thing about it until he moves his brush toward the ink stone, only to find it being switched out for a new one with freshly ground ink.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian breathes.</p>\n<p>\"I am here,\" Lan Wangji replies, then moves to add a few drops of water to the stone and starts rubbing the ink stick through it in small circles.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is tired. So, so tired. His eyes are burning and he has a ridiculous urge to lean his head against Lan Wangji's shoulder. But Lan Wangji doesn't like touching people and even if Wei Wuxian had that right at one point, he doesn't now. He left one night in the pouring rain. And then Lan Wangji left as the wind howled through the dead woods at the base of the mountain.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep, shaky breath and turns back to his talismans. The stack of blank ones is much smaller than it was. He might be able to finish it completely.</p>\n<p>He sinks back into the work. He has no idea how much time passes, but despite his focus he hears immediately when A-Yuan makes a small, distressed noise. He practically flings his brush away to move to his side.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan's eyes flutter open and immediately fill with tears. \"Xian-gege. Hurts.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" Wei Wuxian replies, heart breaking. He settles onto A-Yuan's bed and gathers him in his arms. \"I know, little man.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll fetch the doctor,\" Lan Wangji says softly.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods without looking away from A-Yuan and holds him close as he cries. He knows it doesn't take long for Lan Wangji to fetch the doctor and bring him back, but A-Yuan is so miserable that it feels interminable. All Wei Wuxian can do is stroke his hair and whisper in his ear about how much he loves him.</p>\n<p>When the doctor finally arrives, he takes them in with a glance. His expression transforms into one of concern immediately.</p>\n<p>\"He's in pain,\" Wei Wuxian says, throat tight.</p>\n<p>\"Little one, can you tell me where it hurts?\" the doctor asks A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan hides his face. Wei Wuxian has never known him to be shy, but he supposes he woke up in a new place in pain, with a stranger asking him questions. Lan Wangji settles on the other side of the bed and puts a hand on A-Yuan's back.</p>\n<p>\"A-Yuan,\" Lan Wangji says softly. A-Yuan clearly recognizes Lan Zhan's voice because he lifts his head to peek up at him. \"This is doctor Lan Simiao. He's been helping me all my life and he wants to help you now. Will you tell him where you hurt for your Xian-gege and I?\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan nods and turns back to the doctor. He won't look at him, but he points at his throat, then his head, and then his chest.</p>\n<p>\"That'll do,\" the doctor says. \"I have some things that will help it hurt less.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji rubs one hand softly up and down A-Yuan's back and lifts the other to squeeze Wei Wuxian's shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, I hate this,\" he whispers.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji only nods, but there's a look in his eyes that says he understands perfectly.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says over breakfast on the fourth day since he arrived in the Cloud Recesses with A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>\"Yes?\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"You don't need to stay with us, you know. I'm sure you have more important things to do,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has spent more time in the medical pavilion since Wei Wuxian arrived with A-Yuan than he ever has in all his life prior to this and he hopes to never spend this much time here ever again. For now, this is where Wei Wuxian is, so it is where he is as well. He has no wish to be elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This is not how he ever envisioned Wei Ying returning to Gusu. He would not trade A-Yuan's good health for anything, not even Wei Wuxian's presence in his life. A small part of him, a part he's not proud of, is grateful for the child's illness all the same.</p>\n<p>Their time together will be far shorter than he would like; his uncle was very clear on that. It just means he must savor what time he does have. He only leaves Wei Wuxian's side to cook for him and make brief sojourns to the <em>Jingshi</em> for necessities.</p>\n<p>\"Do you want me to go?\" Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>\"What I want doesn't matter,\" Wei Wuxian replies. \"Not if we're keeping you from doing your duties.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do <em>you</em> want me to go?\" Lan Wangji repeats.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowns. Lan Wangji watches him take a breath and look away. \"No. But I know that's selfish and you don't have to indulge me.\"</p>\n<p>Literally all Lan Wangji wants in this life is to indulge Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\"I am where I want to be,\" Lan Wangji says after a moment of thought. \"If I were truly needed elsewhere, I would go.\"</p>\n<p>He would hate leaving, but he would. It's not a lie.</p>\n<p>\"All right,\" Wei Wuxian says and finally meets Lan Wangji's eyes again. \"Thank you for being so attentive, Hanguang-Jun.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn't know how to respond to that, except with a nod. He's abruptly reminded of what Wei Ying said to his brother the first morning he was in the Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>\n<em>In the absence of Hanguang-Jun, he is my light. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Normally, he might assume Wei Ying was teasing or exaggerating in some way, but that entire first day, where Wei Ying would normally make jokes or deflect, he said precisely what he meant. The exhaustion of travel and worrying for A-Yuan stripped him almost bare.</p>\n<p>He once thought Wei Wuxian would be far better suited to the title of \"Hanguang-Jun\" than he is. Everywhere he went, joy\u2013<em>light\u2013</em>followed. The implication that he can find no light or joy within himself, that he needs to seek those things from outside sources now makes Lan Wangji's heart ache. That he might be one of them almost makes it worse. He has not seen Wei Wuxian in months. Not since that day in Yiling. And prior to that, he hadn't seen him since that night in the rain.</p>\n<p>He wouldn't want to leave Wei Ying's side anyway, but everything about this situation magnifies the need to be with him. It has been a very long time since Lan Wangji spent any time in close quarters with someone like this. Even during the Sunshot Campaign, he had his own tent. He finds himself enjoying sharing space with Wei Wuxian in ways he would never have expected. There is a strange joy in merely being in the same room with him.</p>\n<p>It's pleasant to work or read at this side, but Wei Wuxian's relative silence is unnerving. If there's one word he would never use to describe Wei Ying, it's \"quiet.\" Yet, that's what he has been since he arrived. At first, Lan Wangji thinks he's just tired and worried, but as time goes on he realizes that Wei Wuxian is purposefully stopping himself from talking. He will speak to A-Yuan when he's awake and Lan Wangji some when they are alone, but otherwise, he remains unnaturally silent.</p>\n<p>Where once Lan Wangji relished using the Lan silencing technique on him, now he dearly wishes he had the need to use it. He does not, as it turns out, actually like it when Wei Wuxian is quiet. He wants to hear Wei Wuxian chatter about nonsense, wants his voice to fill the space between them. He wants to hear him spout off absurd theories and chase those thoughts to less absurd ideas. He wants to hear Wei Wuxian's stories of A-Yuan's antics, of Uncle Four's various attempts at distilling alcohol, and of Wen Ning's continuing battles with weeds.</p>\n<p>What he hears are polite requests centered on A-Yuan or the talismans he's making. He doesn't ask for food, doesn't ask for books, doesn't even ask for water to bathe in. Lan Wangji supplies all those things and more, but he wishes Wei Ying would ask even a single thing of him.</p>\n<p>Even his movement is different. He holds himself stiff and contained. He does not sprawl. He does not throw his arms wide as he speaks. He hardly smiles. He even goes to bed at nine without a word of complaint.</p>\n<p>By the time the fifth day starts to wane, Lan Wangji can honestly say he <em>hates</em> this. Wei Wuxian is not quiet. He is not polite, except as it suits him. He is not contained. He is broad gestures, chatter, and big ideas.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hates this, but he has no idea how to go about fixing it.</p>\n<p>The next day after lunch Wei Wuxian is, once again, diligently working on talismans while Lan Wangji sits across from him doing his own work and grinding ink for Wei Ying by turns.</p>\n<p>Both of them immediately stop what they're doing when they hear A-Yuan make a noise from his bed. Wei Ying immediately moves over to him while Lan Wangji makes sure Wei Ying's brush is properly stowed.</p>\n<p>\"Good afternoon, little man,\" Wei Wuxian says as A-Yuan blinks at him. Wei Wuxian scoops A-Yuan into his arms and presses a kiss to his forehead. \"Are you hungry?\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan nods and buries his face in Wei Ying's shoulder as Lan Wangji sets about removing the cover on the still-warm congee they saved for him from lunch.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji kneels close and lifts the spoon from the bowl as Wei Wuxian nudges A-Yuan's head up and settles him into a position on his lap better suited to eating. As he gets better, Lan Wangji is certain A-Yuan will start wanting to do things for himself again, but for now, he seems happy to be fed like a child much younger than he is. Perhaps they are coddling him, but Lan Wangji certainly doesn't mind, especially when it gives Wei Wuxian a chance to hold him.</p>\n<p>It doesn't take long until A-Yuan turns his face from another bite. They haven't made much of a dent in the bowl, but he's still eating better than he was even two days ago.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sets the bowl and spoon down.</p>\n<p>\"What do you say, A-Yuan?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, gege,\" A-Yuan whispers.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, <em>Hanguang-jun,</em>\" Wei Wuxin corrects softly, but firmly.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Hanguang-jun,\" A-Yuan repeats. That title has never sounded sweeter. Lan Wangji would rather just be gege to A-Yuan, but Wei Ying is clearly trying to instill proper manners in the child and it <em>is</em> the most appropriate way to address Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\"You are welcome, A-Yuan,\" Lan Wangji replies and reaches out to brush his hair back. At the same moment, A-Yuan holds his arms out in clear request. It is not a request Lan Wangji would deny him, now or ever. He gently lifts the boy from Wei Wuxian's lap and pulls him close.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan's small fingers curl in the fabric of Lan Wangji's robes and pushes his face into his neck. Lan Wangji leans his cheek against the top of A-Yuan's head and lifts his eyes to meet Wei Wuxian's. The look on his face is everything Lan Wangji has been feeling for days now. It's a thousand things he doesn't have the words for, but under it all is the desire, the <em>need</em> to be with Wei Wuxian and take care of A-Yuan\u2013take care of both of them\u2013for all his days.</p>\n<p>Before he can think to voice any of that, there's a sound of a throat clearing at the doorway. Lan Wangji knows that sound. He's known it for as long as he can remember. The look vanishes from Wei Wuxian's face in an instant and he bounces up to his feet and bows deeply.</p>\n<p>\"Good afternoon, Lan-xiansheng,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"How is the child?\" his uncle asks.</p>\n<p>\"Shufu,\" Lan Wangji says and stands carefully, though he does not try to bow with A-Yuan in his arms. \"A-Yuan, say hello.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hello shufu,\" A-Yuan says in his small, raspy voice, echoing Lan Wangji. He even tries an approximation of a bow, though he wobbles a bit and Lan Wangji tightens his grip on him.</p>\n<p>His uncle's face softens just the slightest bit and Lan Wangji takes a slow breath before answering his Uncle's question.</p>\n<p>\"He still has trouble breathing at times and isn't eating very well, but this is better than it was a few days ago,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren nods sharply. He doesn't even look Wei Wuxian's direction, but keeps his eyes on Lan Wangji and A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>\"He may stay until his breathing is better,\" he finally says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian drops into a bow again. \"Thank you, xiansheng. <em>Thank you</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji holds in his sigh of relief and lets himself press a small kiss to A-Yuan's temple. \"Thank you, shufu.\"</p>\n<p>His uncle stares at him for several long moments, then turns and strides back out of the medical pavilion.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nearly starts crying with relief as Lan Qiren marches away and out of the medical pavilion. A-Yuan isn't yet healthy enough to travel. He knows Lan Wangji and Lan Simiao would have advocated for them to stay, or at least for A-Yuan to stay, but he's glad they don't have to. For so many reasons, not the least of which is standing with his little boy in his arms and a\u2013for once\u2013obvious expression of relief on his face.</p>\n<p>We Wuxian bites the inside of his cheek and blinks rapidly, then turns and kisses A-Yuan on the forehead. \"Hear that, little man? We get to stay here a bit longer so you can get all better and be spoiled by Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>\"He is ill,\" Lan Wangji says as if that's a justification for any of the toys and various other little gifts that have mysteriously appeared daily since they arrived. Wei Wuxian wants to kiss him too. He's close enough. All he would have to do is lean in a few inches. He doesn't.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lets the subject drop. If Lan Wangji is spoiling A-Yuan, he is undoubtedly spoiling Wei Wuxian as well. The thought makes Wei Wuxian's palms itch and his chest feel tight, but the new robes, the combs, the ink grinding, the spicy food he brings from who knows where for him every meal prove it.</p>\n<p>The disinclination to be anywhere but at Wei Wuxian's side. If he thinks about it too much, he'll start down paths he needs to avoid if he's ever going to be able to go home and take back up the life he chose.</p>\n<p>Still, having Lan Wangji at his side again is a relief. It eases something in him he hadn't even realized was coiled tight and tense.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan's eyes droop. He stops holding himself up and rests his head on Lan Wangji's shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Here, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says and holds his hands out to take A-Yuan. \"I'll put him back into his bed.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head. \"He may stay where he is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Spoiling him,\" Wei Wuxian teases.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji ignores him and settles back down where he was sitting as he continues to hold A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lets out a huff of laughter, sits back down behind the table, and lifts his brush to start making talismans again. By the time he leaves, GusuLan will not want for any of the standard talismans for a very long time and will have a healthy supply of many others.</p>\n<p>It is the least Wei Wuxian can do as payment for helping them, for agreeing to heal A-Yuan, for letting him stay despite...everything.</p>\n<p>He works until the doctor returns for A-Yuan's next round of treatments.</p>\n<p>\"I hear you will be staying with us beyond tomorrow,\" Doctor Lan says, as he finishes smoothing the now-familiar poultice over A-Yuan's chest.</p>\n<p>\"I thank Lan-xiansheng for allowing us,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"If he attempted to push you out, I would have had <em>words </em>for that old coot, believe me,\" Lan Simiao nearly growls.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, doctor,\" Wei Wuxian says and tries not to smirk. If actual <em>Lans</em> want to say the things Wei Wuxian thinks about Lan Qiren, he can't say he's unhappy about it.</p>\n<p>\"No thanks are needed. I would be a poor physician indeed if I did not advocate for my patients' best interests,\" he says. \"He will need at least three more days of chest poultices twice a day, but I am pleased with his progress. Remove the poultice within the usual timeframe. I shall see you in the morning.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian murmurs his thanks and bows to the doctor. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Lan Wangji do the same thing.</p>\n<p>The poultices always make A-Yuan sleepy, so Wei Wuxian turns back to his talismans. He's not sure how long he works, but he's startled when Lan Wangji speaks.</p>\n<p>\"You are being very quiet,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"I'm working,\" Wei Wuxian points out.</p>\n<p>\"I have never known you to be quiet while you work on anything,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"I figured you'd be happy,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"I'm not interrupting you or bothering you for once in my life.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying. If you are my soulmate, it is always, not just when you are being quiet and diligent,\" Lan Wangji says. Wei Wuxian's brush falls from his fingers and clatters down to the table, ruining the talisman it lands on.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" he breathes after a long moment, throat tight.</p>\n<p>\"When it is just A-Yuan and I,\" Lan Wangji says. \"Speak as you like.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bites his lip hard and breathes slowly through his nose until he gets the well of emotions that tries to flood him under control.</p>\n<p>If he <em>could</em> speak past the lump in his throat, he might say he's afraid of what might come out if he lets his words flow freely again, or that he might never be able to stop them again once they start. He might say that letting himself talk to Lan Wangji, letting himself grow used to being listened to by someone who understands him and can keep up with each leap of logic will make leaving him behind again all the worse.</p>\n<p>He presses his hands flat to the surface of the table to stop them shaking.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine, Lan Zhan,\" he says, suddenly very glad he was already turned away from Lan Wangji. \"I've been trying to think of ways I could improve the standard containment talismans. Make them harder to break for some of the stronger entities so cultivators don't have to use quite as much spiritual energy when they need it for other things.\"</p>\n<p>He picks up his brush again, grabs a fresh sheet of talisman paper, and sketches out his most recent idea, then hands it over to Lan Wangji. \"Obviously I haven't tested it, but what do you think? I've been trying to run through possible problems, but I do think swapping out rope with something stronger is the best option.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji studies the talisman design, then looks up. \"What about the interaction between the metal radical in shackles and the silk radical in bind?\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought about that and I want to test it both ways, but if it's a problem, I <em>think</em> if we change the bind character to confine, the mountain radical will solve the problem since earth contains metal,\" Wei Wuxian responds. \"Actually, now that I say it out loud, that might be even better.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks back at the talisman in his hand and nods. \"We'll test both when he's better.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins. They probably won't get the chance, but it's a nice thought. \"All right, Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>Three days later, Lan Qiren appears again. This time, Lan Wangji isn't with him. He left to go get lunch and hasn't returned. Wei Wuxian swallows and bows.</p>\n<p>\"Lan-xiansheng,\" he says quietly.</p>\n<p>This time, A-Yuan is sound asleep. He's curled up into a small ball, one arm clutching his stuffed toy.</p>\n<p>It hits Wei Wuxian that A-Yuan's breathing is better enough that...this might be it. Lan Qiren could throw them out of the Cloud Recesses in an instant.</p>\n<p>\"How is he?\" Lan Qiren demands, though he matches Wei Wuxian's quiet tone.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows and answers honestly. \"He's breathing much better, xiansheng, if you would like us to take our leave.\"</p>\n<p>\"How are his other symptoms?\" Lan Qiren asks.</p>\n<p>\"He still sleeps most of the day and isn't eating as well as he should be. He's lost a lot of weight since this started,\" Wei Wuxian replies.</p>\n<p>\"You will stay until the doctor says he reaches a healthy weight again,\" Lan Qiren says and turns to leave immediately.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" Wei Wuxian whispers to his retreating back. \"Thank you, xiansheng.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren doesn't acknowledge him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian realise A-Yuan is well and truly on the mend when he sneaks out of his bed during an afternoon nap and hides in a cupboard. After the initial surge of alarm, Lan Wangji hears him giggling and catches Wei Ying's eye.</p>\n<p>The grin Wei Wuxian gives him in return is the widest, most genuine smile Lan Wangji has seen since he arrived.</p>\n<p>\"Oh no, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Ying says with exaggerated concern. \"Where did A-Yuan go?\"</p>\n<p>\"I have not seen him,\" Lan Wangji says seriously.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan's giggles increase as Wei Ying grins and bounces forward on his toes. \"Oh, Zewu-jun! You're just in time,\" Wei Ying says and Lan Wangji turns to see his brother standing in the doorway with a growing smile on his face. Wei Ying winks and tilts his head toward the cupboard. \"A-Yuan has gone missing! I guess we'll have to call a search party!\"</p>\n<p>\"A very serious matter, indeed,\" Lan Xichen says. \"I'll call my best disciples immediately.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm here! I'm here!\" A-Yuan says and he tumbles out of the cupboard, giggling even more as he dashes toward them.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji catches him and swings him up into his arms so he doesn't go careening into any of the low tables.</p>\n<p>\"I'm here,\" A-Yuan repeats.</p>\n<p>\"So I see,\" Lan Wangji replies and brushes A-Yuan's cupboard-mussed hair out of his face. \"We are very glad you did not vanish into thin air.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, very glad,\" his brother says. The look on his face is...tender is the only word that comes to Lan Wangji's mind.</p>\n<p>\"Zewu-jun is very generous to offer his best disciples for such an expedition, regardless,\" Wei Wuxian says, stepping to Lan Wangji's side and leaning in to bump his forehead gently against A-Yuan's.</p>\n<p>\"I could hardly offer less for a child so beloved by my younger brother, could I?\" Lan Xichen says with a soft smile. \"I am very glad to see you are feeling so much better, Wen-gongzi.\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan hides his face in Lan Wangji's neck.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles and rubs his small back. \"A-Yuan, when an elder speaks to you, you must always acknowledge their words and thank them if they've said something kind.\"</p>\n<p>The briefest look of surprise passes over his brother's face and Lan Wangji can't help but feel a bit smug when A-Yuan straightens again, gives Lan Xichen a shaky, awkward little bow while still in Lan Wangji's arms. \"Thank you\u2013\" he looks at Wei Wuxian in question.</p>\n<p>\"Zewu-Jun,\" Wei Ying supplies.</p>\n<p>\"Zewu-Jun,\" A-Yuan finishes.</p>\n<p>\"You are most welcome, A-Yuan,\" Lan Xichen says.</p>\n<p>He would make a wonderful uncle, Lan Wangji thinks. He would be kind and patient. A-Yuan would never want for affection.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows hard and looks away. A-Yuan is not his son. He has no right to these thoughts. But he <em>wants</em>.</p>\n<p>\"Brother,\" he says. \"Did you need something?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mostly, I came to check on our guests, but we received a crate of musical texts we've been expecting and if I could steal you away from Wei-gongzi to help sort them, that would please me,\" his brother replies.</p>\n<p>\"You should go, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says, and lifts A-Yuan from his arms. \"This one is going to grow sleepy\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"No I'm not,\" A-Yuan protests.</p>\n<p>\"No interrupting,\" Wei Wuxian says firmly. \"This one is going to grow sleepy soon and I will just make more talismans. I know you'll want to help sort those texts.\"</p>\n<p>\"All right,\" Lan Wangji says. He's reluctant to leave Wei Ying's side, but he does want to see those texts for himself.</p>\n<p>\"I'll have him back to you for dinner, I promise,\" Lan Xichen tells Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\"You'd better,\" Wei Wuxian replies with a grin. \"I don't know where Lan Zhan is getting the food he keeps bringing me, but it's not like anything I had in the Cloud Recesses before and it's <em>really good</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen smiles broadly and Lan Wangji can only brace himself for what he knows is going to come next. \"Didn't Wangji tell you, Wei-gongzi? He makes it himself.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's mouth drops open and he stares. \"You cook for me, Lan Zhan?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji clears his throat and looks to the side. \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"You, the Second Young Master of the Lan Clan, the current heir to the sect leader, cook for me?\" he asks, disbelief tinging his words.</p>\n<p>\"Jiang Yanli cooks for you,\" Lan Wangji points out.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, but she's my\u2013\" Wei Wuxian stops himself. He closes his eyes and takes a breath. When he opens them again, his eyes are suspiciously bright. \"<em>Lan Zhan</em>.\"</p>\n<p>He doesn't know what to say, he can hardly meet Wei Wuxian's eyes, but he's glad he does because the practically naked affection Lan Wangji sees there is worth any embarrassment he might be feeling.</p>\n<p>\"Brother, those texts?\" he says, turning to Lan Xichen, whose eyes are dancing with mirth.</p>\n<p>\"Waiting in a crate in the library pavilion,\" Lan Xichen says and starts walking up the path away from the medical pavilion. Lan Wangji follows with a sigh.</p>\n<p>They are halfway to the Library Pavilion when his brother starts speaking again. \"It occurs to me that I never really asked you what you saw when you visited Yiling. It's becoming clear to me that I should have. Many things have been said by many people about Wei-gongzi and what he is doing there, but you are the only one who has seen. I trust you over rumor and conjecture. I had no idea there was a child with them.\"</p>\n<p>\"They are a small settlement. It is the only place where there is any green on the whole mountain and that seems to only exist because of the hard work of Wei Ying and the Wens,\" Lan Wangji says. \"A-Yuan is the only young child, but there are several elders. None of the rest are warriors or particularly strong cultivators apart from Wen Qionglin and Wen Qing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who were only ever healers,\" Lan Xichen says with a sigh. \"And what of Wei-gongzi?\"</p>\n<p>\"When I was there, it was clear that when he was not working hard to keep them all safe and fed, he spent much of his time attempting to wake Wen Qionglin, doing research, and inventing useful things that would be of benefit to all,\" Lan Wangji says. \"He is not building an army. He is protecting good people, whose only crime is having the wrong name, from evil perpetrated by another clan.\"</p>\n<p>His brother is quiet until they reach the Library pavilion. \"Wangji, I know you trust him. I know the remaining Wens are worthy of help, but it is not a simple matter.\"</p>\n<p>\"Isn't it?\" Lan Wangji asks. \"We stood by as the Jin Clan paraded their prisoners about in front of us as trophies and used their terror to entertain. The only person who did anything to help them was Wei Ying and he was condemned for it. What has GusuLan become that we would stand by and let such things occur?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen's head dips down and he closes his eyes. Lan Wangji knows he has hurt his brother and he hates it.</p>\n<p>\"Xiongzhang, you do not bear this alone. I do. Shufu does. Every elder who stayed silent does. We are all guilty,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen opens his eyes again and meets Lan Wangji's steadily. \"I can make no promises, but I will do what I can.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji brings his hands together and bows. \"I trust Lan-zongzhu to do what is righteous to the fullest extent of his ability.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen tugs him up out of his bow with a gentle smile. \"Come. Let's look at those texts.\"</p>\n<p>When he returns to the medical pavilion with dinner, Wei Ying's eyes go wide and he scrambles to help clear away the table so they can eat.</p>\n<p>He praises the food extravagantly.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying, there is no need to\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"There is every need,\" Wei Ying counters. \"Because all I can give you in return for doing this for me is praise and I mean every word.\"</p>\n<p>\"You do not owe me anything for making you food you will enjoy,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"It's not that I think I owe you,\" Wei Wuxian replies. \"At least not much. It's that...you are doing these things for me and I wish I could reciprocate because you deserve lovely things that make you happy as well.\"</p>\n<p>\"You being here makes me happy,\" Lan Wangji says and takes a sip of tea. He can't quite bring himself to look at Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is <em>almost</em> used to waking up at five in the morning.</p>\n<p>Almost. It helps that Lan Zhan always presses a cup of hot, strong tea into his hand almost as soon as he's awake and brings him breakfast not long after.</p>\n<p>It also helps that Lan Simiao arrives for A-Yuan's first check-up of the day at 5:30 sharp every morning. He's doing better, but Wei Wuxian always feels a little bit anxious until the doctor listens to his lungs and checks his temperature and confirms that he hasn't relapsed in the night.</p>\n<p>Now that he's feeling so much better, A-Yuan is, of course, also perfectly content to be awake so early, this morning even more than usual because the doctor has promised him a companion to play with.</p>\n<p>\"Are you sure?\" Wei Wuxian asks the doctor. \"He's well enough?\"</p>\n<p>\"He is,\" the doctor assures him. \"We won't want him running around a lot, but I trust that between you and Hanguang-Jun you can contain two small boys, one who is only just walking.\"</p>\n<p>\"And you're sure his parents are fine with their son spending time with me?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"He is my grandson, Wei-gongzi,\" the doctor says. \"As I trust you, so do they.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says. \"It will be fine. We will both be here.\"</p>\n<p>\"A-Yuan isn't used to other children,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"And he can be pretty loud and...exuberant. What if he overwhelms your grandson?\"</p>\n<p>At this, Lan Simiao tips his head back and laughs. Even Lan Zhan has a small smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi, I think you will find that won't be a problem with my grandson. He can also be quite loud and exuberant.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" Wei Wuxian says. He doesn't know why he's fretting. He has never in his life been a person who frets about things.</p>\n<p>But A-Yuan has been so sick and he won't, he <em>can't</em> do anything to jeopardize his health.</p>\n<p>The doctor slips away to go get his grandson while Lan Wangji makes sure A-Yuan finishes his breakfast, and Wei Wuxian moves the table he's been working on back and away to leave more room for the boys to play. He gathers up A-Yuan's toys and puts them all in the newly cleared area. There's already quite the collection because Lan Zhan is absolutely determined to spoil him rotten. Wei Wuxian isn't entirely certain how he's going to get it all back to the Burial Mounds, but that's a problem for the future.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian finishes his preparations in time to watch Lan Wangji clear away the breakfast tray and then see A-Yuan lift his face with a sweet smile so Lan Wangji can wash it with the cloth in his hand.</p>\n<p>\"I cannot believe he volunteers for that when it's you,\" Wei Wuxian says with a pout.</p>\n<p>\"Do you tease him while you do it?\" Lan Wangji asks mildly as he gently rubs the cloth over A-Yuan's cheeks.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs dramatically and flops down to sit cross-legged on the floor. He rests his chin on his hands and watches Lan Zhan move to A-Yuan's hands, and then watches him straighten the pale blue outer robe he's been wearing since he's been well enough to get out of bed. A-Yuan looks absurdly cute. The only thing setting him apart from being a tiny baby Lan is that he has no forehead ribbon.</p>\n<p>It's not hard at all to imagine one there, to imagine Lan Wangji lifting it to A-Yuan's forehead and carefully tying it for him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No one can touch it but parents, children, and significant others.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He shakes his head to dislodge the thought, and a moment later the doctor returns holding the hand of a child in robes that look very much like the ones A-Yuan is wearing.</p>\n<p>When A-Yuan notices him, he hides behind Lan Zhan's leg and peeks out around his thigh. Wei Wuxian wants to coo. Instead, he moves to crouch down between the two boys. \"A-Yuan, come out and meet your new friend.\"</p>\n<p>He smiles wide at the other boy who immediately smiles back, wide and beaming. This one isn't shy at all. \"What's your name, young master?\"</p>\n<p>\"Jing-er!\" the child replies brightly.</p>\n<p>\"It's very nice to meet you, Jing-er,\" Wei Wuxian says and reaches a hand out to A-Yuan. He hesitantly steps out from behind Lan Wangji and takes Wei Wuxian's hand. \"Jing-er, this is A-Yuan.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hi!\" Jing-er chirps with a big grin. It doesn't take long at all for A-Yuan to grin back, and a few moments after that they've moved over to the toys on the bamboo mat. Wei Wuxian grins at them, then pushes himself up to stand next to Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\"I guess they'll be fine,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies. The two of them sit to the side of the room and go back to their usual tasks. Well. Wei Wuxian tries to, but he's sort of having fun watching the boys.</p>\n<p>The first time Jing-er shrieks with laughter, he quickly stifles himself and glances worriedly toward Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn't scold or even encourage Jing-er to be quieter. All he does is give him the tiniest smile and then goes back to his work. Jing-er doesn't try to be quiet again after that.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has never wanted to kiss him more than he does at this moment. Instead, he bites his lip and tries to concentrate on the talisman in front of him.</p>\n<p>The two boys are fast friends well before Jing-er has to go back home. The next several days are much the same. They wake up and have breakfast together, then Lan Simiao brings Jing-er to play for the rest of the morning.</p>\n<p>On the third morning, the doctor kicks them all out of the medical pavilion. \"He needs fresh air and sunshine, now, and it's time for him to start being more active again.\"</p>\n<p>\"This way,\" Lan Wangji says, takes A-Yuan's hand, and leads them down the paths of the Cloud Recesses, past the cold pond, and to the area where the bunnies live. Wei Wuxian is absolutely delighted. They lose track of time playing with the bunnies. Lan Wangji shows the boys how to be quiet and gentle with them so they don't scare them away. He makes a game of it and then starts piling them up with bunny after bunny until the boys are giggling, but continuing to stay still.</p>\n<p>It is far and away the cutest thing Wei Wuxian has ever witnessed. The sun is warm, the bunny in his lap is soft, and Lan Wangji is almost smiling.</p>\n<p>It's going to be so, so hard to go back to Yiling after this. He forces that thought away. There's no use in dwelling on it when he can live in this moment and enjoy it.</p>\n<p>They both notice when A-Yuan starts flagging. They gently shoo away the bunnies and start leading the boys back toward the medical pavilion.</p>\n<p>They're moving through one of the more populated areas of the Cloud Recesses when Jing-er sneezes. He looks so startled and alarmed at himself that Wei Wuxian can't help but laugh. The joy of the morning all comes out at once and he laughs hard and loud. Two moments too late, he sees Lan Qiren is coming toward them from the other direction.</p>\n<p>The man doesn't look at them, but when he's a few paces past them, he mutters, \"Imagine someone letting Wei Wuxian raise a child.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's laughter dies in his throat and he takes a breath.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying\u2013\" Lan Wangji says, voice soft.</p>\n<p>\"Let's get these two buns back to the medical pavilion,\" Wei Wuxian interrupts with a bright smile. \"They've had quite the big morning.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swings A-Yuan up and sets him on his shoulders. He giggles wildly and Wei Wuxian thinks his heart might just fall out of his chest. This boy is so precious. He deserves every single good thing.</p>\n<p>They get back to the medical pavilion and before Lan Wangji can leave to go get lunch for them all, Wei Wuxian stops him.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, would you please tell your brother and uncle I would like to speak with them?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"Of course,\" Lan Wangji says. \"What about?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't think I'll be able to say it more than once, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian replies and looks away from his searching eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I'll speak with them,\" Lan Wangji promises and then he's gone.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian plops himself down on the floor with the boys and puts everything out of his mind while they wait for Lan Wangji to return with their food. He manages to focus on them and then lunch even after Lan Zhan tells him his brother and uncle agreed to see him that afternoon.</p>\n<p>When the doctor returns, Wei Wuxian asks him to watch A-Yuan for a little while, and then lets Lan Wangji lead him through the Cloud Recesses and to the rooms where Lan Xichen conducts most of his business.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi,\" Lan Xichen says in greeting with his usual smile. Lan Qiren stands next to him, scowl firmly in place.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bows deeply toward them. \"Lan-zongzhu. Xiansheng.\"</p>\n<p>\"What may we do for you?\" Lan Xichen asks.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a breath and falls to his knees. He has to swallow twice before he can bring himself to start speaking.</p>\n<p>\"You were right, earlier, Lan-xiansheng,\" Wei Wuxian says, head bowed. \"I am not fit to take care of A-Yuan. I cannot give him everything he needs, everything he deserves. The Burial Mounds are no place for a child. We barely have the means to keep everyone fed. I can't even buy him simple grass toys, never mind a good sword, or books, or any of the other things a young man needs to learn cultivation.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have done my best, but that could never be enough,\" Wei Wuxian's voice cracks and tears start running down his face and drip off his chin. He doesn't rise from his bow, but presses on. \"I must beg you to take him in. He is a sweet, obedient child who brings so much joy to everyone who knows him. I know he would make a wonderful Lan disciple. Please give him the life I cannot give him. Give him the life he deserves.\"</p>\n<p>The very thought of returning to the Burial Mounds without A-Yuan makes him feel as if he's slipping further and further into despair with every passing moment, but he can't be selfish. Not about this little boy who deserves the whole world.</p>\n<p>\"You would give up your child?\" Lan Qiren asks.</p>\n<p>\"I would give up <em>everything</em>,\" Wei Wuxian replies. \"I would let you lock me up. I would let you punish me for my sins however you see fit, if it meant A-Yuan could have a better life. If it meant he could live free of fear, with a full belly and toys and books and love. But I <em>can't</em>. If I want to protect those I have vowed to protect I have a single path forward, so I must take it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have a duty and I will see it through. The remaining Wens deserve more than slave labor and abuse. They are good people whose only crime is their name. I will protect them with the means available to me. I can only hope you feel that, as a child, Wen Yuan deserves better things. I can only hope that your compassion and A-Yuan's promise as a Lan disciple will be enough.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji breathes from behind him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turns and their eyes meet. He wants, more than anything, to spend all his days helping raise A-Yuan with Lan Wangji at his side. He closes his eyes and lets the tears flow.</p>\n<p>\"Please,\" he whispers. \"Please, let A-Yuan stay.\"</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian may be quiet, but Lan Wangji can see that he's shaking and tears are flowing freely down his face. He clenches his hands into fists to stop himself from reaching out.</p>\n<p>Instead he looks at his brother. To most, his expression would seem to be the same neutral, friendly face he usually wears, but Lan Wangji can see more. He can see his brother's concern, he can see his <em>guilt</em>. Their eyes meet and he tries to telegraph everything he can't say right now.</p>\n<p>His brother nods at him and looks over at their uncle. Lan Wangji clenches his jaw as his uncle scowls. He's two beats from falling to his knees next to Wei Wuxian, from offering his own supplication, but his uncle cuts him off before he can.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Wuxian,\" Lan Qiren barks.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Xiansheng,\" Wei Wuxian replies.</p>\n<p>\"If GusuLan offered the Wen remnants sanctuary, would you accept?\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sucks in a breath. Lan Wangji watches his hands tremble where they are still clasped together in a bow. \"If they would not be prisoners, if you would guarantee they would have freedom, but also your protection?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Lan Xichen says.</p>\n<p>\"Then I would accept in a heartbeat and offer myself for whatever punishment GusuLan deems fit,\" he replies, voice going hoarse.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren snaps, \"Stand up, Wei Wuxian!\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji finally allows himself to reach out and help Wei Wuxian back to his feet. He doesn't let go.</p>\n<p>His uncle shakes out his sleeves with a huff. \"You would not be a prisoner. I would not have my nephew following in his father's footsteps quite yet.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can't hold in the small gasp that escapes him and his brother makes a wounded sort of noise he hasn't heard in a very long time.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks distinctly confused, but he maintains his silence, waiting. Lan Wangji watches his Adam's apple bob as he swallows.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi,\" Lan Xichen says. \"GusuLan is prepared to offer the Wens a plot of land to settle on and work as they see fit. We will offer protection and financial assistance as needed. We would appreciate Wen Qing's expertise should she choose to share it with us, but would not require it. We would only ask that you allow us to speak with and examine Wen Qionglin and...as a personal request, I would like you to allow Wangji to play the Song of Clarity for you daily.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wen Ning can refuse or deny your request himself,\" Wei Wuxian says firmly. \"As for the second thing...Lan Zhan is always welcome to play for me, but I don't believe your songs will work on me any longer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why would that be, Wei Wuxian?\" Lan Qiren asks sharply. Lan Wangji already has suspicions about what the answer to that question might be. They've been building in his mind since the night Wei Wuxian arrived.</p>\n<p>\"You are doing this for us, offering us this sanctuary, so of course I will tell you. In time. I'd like to keep it for myself a little while longer, if that's all right,\" Wei Wuxian murmurs and bows.</p>\n<p>\"Fine,\" Lan Qiren says. Lan Wangji does not miss the sigh of relief Wei Wuxian releases at his uncle's agreement.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says. It comes out quieter than he intends, so quiet he's afraid Wei Wuxian won't hear him, but he turns and their eyes meet.</p>\n<p>\"Would you allow me to tell just Lan Zhan?\" he asks. Wei Wuxian takes Lan Wangji's hand in his and squeezes once before letting go and turning back toward the other two. \"If he thinks you should know, I wouldn't stop him from telling,\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't see any reason why not,\" Lan Xichen says with a nod and a small smile.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Zewu-jun,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"If you would like to take Wangji and go to Yiling to bring the Wens back, shufu and I will see that we are ready for them,\" Lan Xichen says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bows once again, deeply and very clearly genuinely respectful in a way he rarely is. \"There are no words to sufficiently express my gratitude. I owe the Lan Clan a debt I can never repay, but know I will spend my life trying.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji murmurs again. He's about to move when his brother moves to stand in front of Wei Wuxian and tugs him up out of his bow. When he looks up, Lan Wangji can see the surprise in Wei Ying's face that it is his brother in front of him.</p>\n<p>\"It is the right thing to do, Wei-gongzi. I apologize for not taking action sooner,\" Lan Xichen says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nods in acknowledgement. \"Thank you all the same. I know the other sects will not look kindly on this. There is little I can offer that would smooth the way, except\u2013\"</p>\n<p>He reaches into his sleeve and pulls out the Stygian Tiger Amulet. Lan Wangji's breath stops in his throat. \"This has been the only thing standing between us and...most of the cultivation world. I trust Lan-zongzhu would never want it for the things others would, so I offer its destruction. If you will stand between us and those who might exterminate us, then I do not need it any longer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi, you honor me and GusuLan with this trust. I do think it would ease certain minds to know it was no longer in this world,\" Lan Xichen says.</p>\n<p>\"And frustrate others,\" Wei Wuxian says wryly. \"But they are probably smart enough to understand that to object would show them to be the unrighteous, power-hungry beasts they are.\"</p>\n<p>\"And you are <em>not</em> unrighteous and power-hungry?\" Lan Qiren asks. Lan Wangji looks at him sharply, but his uncle doesn't seem any more angry than usual.</p>\n<p>\"Xiansheng, I do not know that I could ever be considered righteous in your eyes, but I have never been power-hungry. All I have wanted is to protect the people I promised to protect. There are many things I have given up to do that, and now I will give up the one tool I have which allows me to do so on my own. I hope xiansheng at least views that as a righteous action from an unrighteous man,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>The stirring in Lan Wangji's chest at Wei Ying calling himself unrighteous is almost a surprise. There had been times where he feared Wei Wuxian had fallen to darkness, but Lan Wangji knows, now, that he never did and never will. He may have turned from the path approved by the world, but he did so because the shadows on the bright, sunlit path were growing longer. Those deemed righteous were hiding their sins in them and Wei Ying did not join those shadows, but shined a light on them as he stepped away from treachery and made his own way in the world.</p>\n<p>His uncle says nothing, but reaches out to take the Stygian Tiger Amulet from Wei Wuxian's hand. \"Can it be destroyed safely?\"</p>\n<p>\"There are many precautions we will need to take in order to avoid a backlash,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"I do not believe it would be safe to do it here in the Cloud Recesses. I would say the Burial Mounds, once clear of living beings again, would be a good place for it, but I fear the reaction of the resentful spirits there, particularly since they have been suppressed since our arrival.\"</p>\n<p>\"We will research. Later,\" Lan Xichen says. \"Once you have retrieved the Wens.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods. \"I have some ideas. It's something I've been thinking about for a while now, but the GusuLan library will be an invaluable resource.\"</p>\n<p>\"Go, then. Take Wangji and bring the Wens back to the Cloud Recesses,\" Lan Xichen says with a smile and a subtle glance his way.</p>\n<p>\"With that many people, it will take many days on foot,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"You have my permission to hire horses,\" Lan Xichen. \"Or anything else that will ease the way.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, xiongzhang,\" Lan Wangji says and bows. Wei Ying bows beside him and then they straighten and take their leave.</p>\n<p>When they're halfway back to the medical pavilion, Wei Wuxian grabs his wrist. \"Lan Zhan, that really happened, yes? This isn't all an elaborate hallucination, is it?\"</p>\n<p>\"It happened. You are not hallucinating,\" Lan Wangji assures him. He can't help but wonder if Wei Ying has hallucinated such things before. \"We will leave shortly.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's hand tightens around his wrist. \"If it's not a hallucination...I promised I would tell you.\"</p>\n<p>\"It does not need to be now,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, it does,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"For one thing, if I don't do it now, I might lose my nerve. For another, you deserve to know why I can't travel to Yiling the easiest, fastest way.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"Let's go somewhere else,\" Wei Wuxian says and tugs his wrist. He leads them beyond the place the bunnies inhabit, past the cold springs, and up to the waterfall at the back of the mountain.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stands beside Wei Wuxian on a rock outcropping looking out over the river and waits for him to start speaking.</p>\n<p>\"Please don't interrupt once I start, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"I mean, you're far too proper and polite to interrupt anyone, but...if I stop, I'm not sure I'll be able to finish.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji agrees.</p>\n<p>\"If...if you decide to tell your brother and uncle any of it, I would be grateful if you would only tell them the parts pertaining to me and leave out...anyone else,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"I promise,\" Lan Wangji says immediately.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, you don't even know what you're agreeing to,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"I trust you.\" He does. With his whole heart.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows audibly. \"Lan Zhan, you really\u2013\" he cuts himself off. \"I can only hope to be worthy of that trust.\"</p>\n<p>He falls silent and they stand next to one another for several long moments. Lan Wangji listens to the water flow and to the birds in the trees until Wei Wuxian starts speaking. His voice is uncharacteristically soft. Not, Lan Wangji knows, because he's afraid of being overheard.</p>\n<p>\"When Wang Lingjiao came to Lotus Pier, at first we thought it was merely for the purpose of intimidation, for petty revenge. She demanded I be punished for my transgressions in the Xuanwu Cave. Madam Yu complied.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji curls his hands into fists, but does not interrupt.</p>\n<p>\"Then she overplayed her hand and Madam Yu put her in her place. Except then two things happened. She brought Wen Zhuliu with her and while he fought Madam Yu, Wang Lingjiao set off the signal. Before\u2013before things got bad, Madam Yu put Jiang Cheng and I on a boat, tied us up with Zidian, and sent us down the river.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pauses long enough here that Lan Wangji looks over at him and sees he's fighting back tears. Their arms touch when Lan Wangji shifts closer and Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"As soon as we could we went back, but it was too late. We, ah...we ran and found Shijie and found an inn. It was...everything was awful and when I was out buying food, I saw Wen disciples looking for us. I went back to the inn so we could run again, but Jiang Cheng was gone and I knew exactly where he went. So I sent Shijie to Madam Yu's family and went after him.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a shaky breath and leans into Lan Wangji's side. \"Wen Ning was there and he...he brought Jiang Cheng to me and Madam Yu and Uncle Jiang's remains and then Wen Qing arrived and I was sure we were done for, but she lied to the other Wens and she took care of Jiang Cheng's injuries and in doing so, discovered he no longer had a golden core.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels the horror building in him. Lan Wangji spent three long months fighting at Jiang Wanyin's side as they looked for Wei Ying. Sect Leader Jiang has a golden core.</p>\n<p>\"Wen Qing and Wen Ning hid us away and took us to the Yiling Supervisory Office. Jiang Cheng was...he was...practically catatonic. From...everything. He was ready to die. To give up. I couldn't\u2013I promised Madam Yu and Uncle Jiang I would take care of him and I immediately failed to keep that promise. I had to do something. I spent days and days poring over Wen Qing's books. I didn't sleep much. I finally found something, I convinced Wen Qing, but I didn't know how to make that happen without causing even more problems. Until one day while hunting, I came across Song Lan in the mountains.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels himself go utterly still. No one had heard anything of Song Lan or Xiao Xingchen since word spread of the destruction of Baixue Temple.</p>\n<p>\"Song Lan told me that Xue Yang was responsible, that he blinded Song Lan in revenge, to get back at Xiao Xingchen. He told me that Xiao Xingchen took him to Baoshan Sanren and begged her to heal his dearest friend's eyes. And so, I had an idea. I told Jiang Cheng that Baoshan Sanren had the power to heal him. I told him I knew where to find her. I told him that if he pretended to be me, if he never once opened his eyes to see the Immortal Mountain, that she could heal him.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes. He knows where this is going. He doesn't need Wei Wuxian to finish. He listens anyway.</p>\n<p>\"We climbed a mountain near Yiling. I blindfolded Jiang Cheng and at the top, he was greeted not by Baoshan Sanren or any of her disciples, but by Wen Qing, who put him to sleep. She then did surgery to transfer my golden core to Jiang Cheng. So. You see, Lan Zhan. I <em>can't </em>use Suibian. I can't cultivate the righteous path at your side any longer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" he breathes, finally. His chest feels tight and his eyes burn. He clenches his teeth and swallows.</p>\n<p>\"I'm useless, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"Now more than ever.\"</p>\n<p>\"Never,\" Lan Wangji insists, voice so rough he barely recognizes it. Wei Wuxian could be a common citizen who never cultivated a day in his life and he would still be bright and brilliant and wonderful.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turns to look at him, expression one of surprise. His eyes go even wider when he looks into Lan Wangji's face. \"Lan Zhan. Lan Zhan, don't cry. It's not\u2013it's done. I've adapted.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did it hurt?\" Lan Wangji asks. Wei Wuxian looks away and doesn't answer. \"Wei Ying, did it hurt?\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods slowly.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has known that Wei Wuxian is selfless and giving since an evening years ago in a spot very near where they are now where they lit a lantern and made a promise. But this...he swallows hard.</p>\n<p>\"You do not need to cultivate the righteous path to be at my side,\" he says when he can finally trust his voice to speak again.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's eyes fill instantly with tears. \"Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you ride with me on Bichen, we can be in Yiling before nightfall,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, you are a strong cultivator, but even you would be exhausted after a trip that long carrying two,\" Wei Wuxian says, swiping at his eyes.</p>\n<p>\"The return journey will be on horseback, which I will not need spiritual energy for,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian huffs. \"Fine, fine. You win. Let's go tell A-Yuan we're going to go bring him his granny and aunties and uncles.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" he says as they start moving down the path toward the medical pavilion. \"I will not tell anyone what you have told me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...I trust you. If you decide you need to, I know it will be the right thing,\" Wei Wuxian replies, with a small but genuine smile.</p>\n<p>It's good enough for now, Lan Wangji thinks.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels wrung out. He never intended to tell anyone that story. Not now, not ever.</p>\n<p>He is deeply, deeply grateful that the person he told is Lan Wangji, grateful Lan Xichen and Lan Qiren didn't ask him to tell them as well. The fact that Lan Wangji now knows his most closely guarded secret is...a relief. The burden of it feels a little bit less heavy. Wei Wuxian hadn't realized how much he hated keeping this from Lan Zhan. He should have. Every time he dodged Lan Wangji's questions, every time he misdirected, every time he outright lied or told Lan Wangji it wasn't his business...he <em>hated</em> it.</p>\n<p>When the two of them walk into the medical pavilion, A-Yuan lifts his head from where he's sitting at a table with a calligraphy brush in hand, wearing white and blue Lan robes that are already stained with ink at the cuffs, and beams at them. \"You're back!\"</p>\n<p>\"We are,\" Wei Wuxian says \"But only for a little while, and then we're going to be gone for a few days. Do you want to know why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" A-Yuan asks.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian opens his mouth to respond, but finds himself suddenly overcome. This is <em>happening</em>.</p>\n<p>\"We are going to go to Yiling and will bring back your grandmother and all of your other relatives to live here with us,\" Lan Wangji tells him.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan's eyes go wide. \"Granny? And Ning-gege? And Qing-jie? And Uncle Four?\"</p>\n<p>\"All of them,\" Lan Wangji assures him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian covers his face with his hands and tries to breathe.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying?\" Lan Wangji asks softly and cups Wei Wuxian's elbows in his hands.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2013I went in there thinking that I would\u2013that I would have to leave alone and give up my\u2013\" he cuts himself off with a gasp, but he can't stop himself from shaking.</p>\n<p>\"I would have gone with you,\" Lan Wangji whispers. \"I would not have let you leave alone again.\"</p>\n<p>All hope Wei Wuxian might have had that he could stave off breaking down further is gone. All he can do is pitch forward, press his face to Lan Wangji's shoulder, and cry.</p>\n<p>\"Xian-gege?\" A-Yuan asks, voice full of concern. Suddenly, small arms wrap around his leg as Lan Wangji's hand comes to rest on the center of his back.</p>\n<p>It takes him several long moments to finally get some control back. He grounds himself in the warmth of two of the people he loves more than anyone else in the world.</p>\n<p>\"This is happening, right Lan Zhan?\" he whispers.</p>\n<p>\"It is happening,\" Lan Wangji confirms. \"They will be safe. You will be safe.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. He takes a few moments to collect himself, then twists around to lift A-Yuan up off the floor and into his arms with a sweeping arc that makes him giggle.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to get them and bring them back and we're going to have a <em>feast</em>,\" Wei Ying tells him, pressing his forehead against A-Yuan's.</p>\n<p>\"With meat?\" A-Yuan asks.</p>\n<p>\"With meat,\" Wei Wuxian confirms. \"And red paper lanterns and the last of Uncle Four's fruit wine for the adults and sweet soup for little boys.\"</p>\n<p>\"You won't get drunk and cry again like last time, right?\" A-Yuan asks.</p>\n<p>\"A-Yuan!\" Wei Wuxian scolds. \"Qing-jie said!\" A-Yuan cries, sounding genuinely concerned. \"She was sad you were sad when everyone was so happy.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a careful breath.</p>\n<p>\"There will be no crying at this feast, unless the tears are happy,\" he declares. \"But we have to go get them so we can <em>have</em> the feast, so you'll have to be good for Lan-daifu and Zewu-Jun and play nicely with little Jingyi until we get back, all right?\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan nods eagerly.</p>\n<p>\"Good boy,\" Wei Wuxian praises, and sets him back down on the ground and looks up at the doctor. \"I hope it's not too much of an imposition to ask if he can stay with your family until we're back?\"</p>\n<p>\"It would be our pleasure, Wei-gongzi,\" Lan Simiao replies. \"Now, go on. I am rather eager to consult with Wen-daifu on several subjects.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian puts his hands together and bows. He leans down to kiss the top of A-Yuan's head and smiles when Lan Wangji reaches out to brush a hand over his head before they step out into the afternoon sun.</p>\n<p>\"You're sure about me riding with you on Bichen?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" he replies. They walk through the Cloud Recesses to the outer wall. The guards at the wall bow to Lan Wangji as they leave. As soon as they are out of view of the wall, Lan Zhan steps onto Bichen and holds his hand out to Wei Wuxian who laughs and takes it.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, I know for a fact the rules say you must be further from the gates than <em>this</em> before mounting your sword,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"Extenuating circumstances,\" Lan Wangji replies as Wei Wuxian settles himself beside him.</p>\n<p>\"You're really sure?\" Wei Wuxian asks one last time. \"I'll have to hold onto you the whole way.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying. It is fine. I don't mind,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>\"How times change, Hanguang-Jun,\" Wei Wuxian teases and wraps his arms around Lan Wangji's waist.</p>\n<p>He enjoys it for the first hour or so. It's been a long time since he flew anywhere and he missed the sensation. He revels in the excuse to hold onto Lan Wangji like this. All this time, they have caught one another, they have helped each other up, they have tended one another's wounds, but they have never actually embraced. Lan Zhan has let Wei Wuxian touch him more than usual these last weeks, but he's just being kind because Wei Wuxian has been distressed.</p>\n<p>If he closes his eyes, he can imagine this is something Lan Wangji wants and not just something he's enduring in order to get to Yiling the quickest way possible. He takes a deep breath and rests his forehead against Lan Wangji's shoulder and feels the wind blow through his hair.</p>\n<p>By the time they touch down, he's frozen stiff and exhausted. Lan Wangji, of course, looks hardly any the worse for the wear, though Wei Wuxian knows him well enough that he can see that he's also very tired.</p>\n<p>\"I will speak with the stablemaster,\" Lan Wangji says and presses his coin purse into Wei Wuxian's hand. \"Buy food for everyone. For tonight, and then the journey.\"</p>\n<p>\"Meet you at the edge of town?\" Wei Wuxian suggests.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods and they go in opposite directions.</p>\n<p>It occurs to Wei Wuxian as this could be the last time he walks the streets of Yiling. The last time he buys food from these vendors. The last time any of them will look past him, not realizing the person they fear is standing in front of them counting out his coin to buy seeds and bruised vegetables at a discount. At least, if he's lucky. Fate seems bent on bringing him back here.</p>\n<p>He buys food quickly, suddenly eager to see the look on Wen Qing's face when he tells her the news. Maybe it will feel like reality then.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is already waiting for him when he gets to the edge of town.</p>\n<p>\"How'd it go?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"We will have a full complement of horses, and one of the stablehands can follow with a wagon if there is anything we can't carry on the horses,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs. \"I will be very surprised if that's true, but thank you for the consideration, Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>They start walking. The road narrows to a path only used by the residents of the Burial Mounds.</p>\n<p>\"This trip was probably a bit of a blur the last time you made it, huh, Lan Zhan?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>\"I know it probably wasn't a very notable day for you, but...that was a really, really good day for me. One of the few. So...thank you, I suppose,\" Wei Wuxian says as they walk beyond the place they said goodbye all those months ago.</p>\n<p>\"It was a good day,\" Lan Wangji says. \"I didn't want it to end.\"</p>\n<p>Before Wei Wuxian has the chance to say any of the stupid things running through his head at that, they crest the top of the hill to see Wen Ning and Wen Qing waiting for them.</p>\n<p>\"Hanguang-Jun, Wei Wuxian,\" Wen Qing says and her voice trembles. \"A-Yuan?\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine!\" Wei Wuxian rushes to say. \"He's fine. Recovering well. He got to spend the morning with Lan-daifu's small grandson and had a good time.\"</p>\n<p>\"So you got my letter?\" she asks.</p>\n<p>\"I did,\" Wei Wuxian replies and he can't quite keep the bitterness out of his tone. \"And I burned it. Then, this afternoon, I realized you were right, so I went to ask Zewu-Jun if he would take A-Yuan in as a Lan disciple. He offered another solution.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bows to Wen Qing. \"Wen-daifu, GusuLan is offering protection, sanctuary, and a plot of land for the Wen remnants to live on and work as they see fit. We are here to take you back to Gusu.\"</p>\n<p>Wen Qing crosses her arms over her chest. \"And what are the conditions?\"</p>\n<p>\"None,\" Wei Wuxian replies. \"You can live in Gusu and be free and they will protect you.\"</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes. \"Forgive me if I don't believe you. Conditions placed on <em>you</em> are still conditions and you refuse to protect yourself, so clearly someone has to. Lan Wangji, what has GusuLan demanded of him in order to do this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"I would not have let them place any conditions on him I would not ask them to also put on myself. He is my soulmate and I trust him as I trust myself.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then why did it take him showing up on your doorstep begging in order for you to take any action?\" she demands. \"Why did you let him go? Why did you leave him?\"</p>\n<p>\"Wen Qing,\" Wei Wuxian starts, but she lifts a hand and cuts him off, eyes firmly on Lan Wangji, who is looking back with an expression on his face Wei Wuxian has never seen before.</p>\n<p>\"I will not do so again,\" Lan Wangji says. It sounds like a vow. Wei Wuxian swallows hard.</p>\n<p>\"Good, because we were left picking up the pieces and if I have to do that again, I will kill you and make it look like qi deviation,\" she says. Wei Wuxian is relatively certain she's not joking.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bows to her again. \"I accept those terms.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can we get to the part where we eat this food we brought from Yiling and pack up to leave, now?\" Wei Wuxian asks. His face feels hot and he swallows down five more responses, each more flippant and irreverent than the last.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing levels a glare at him. \"I haven't agreed to anything yet.\"</p>\n<p>\"Qing-jie, it's the best option,\" Wei Wuxian says quietly. \"I know you're tired, too. I already gave them the Stygian Tiger Amulet for destruction\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"You said there were no conditions,\" Wen Qing interrupts sharply.</p>\n<p>\"They did not ask,\" We Wuxian replies. \"I offered it.\"</p>\n<p>\"You trust them that much?\" she asks, unable to mask her surprise.</p>\n<p>\"I trust Lan Zhan,\" he replies. \"He trusts his uncle and brother, so I trust them.\"</p>\n<p>She searches his face for several long moments, before turning to walk back toward the center of the settlement. \"Tell the others we are moving to Gusu, then, but first tell them about A-Yuan.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Wen Qing,\" Wei Wuxian agrees with a grin, and bounds into the center of the settlement and calls everyone to him. The cheers that go up at the news of A-Yuan's recovery and their new accommodations would be enough to keep him happy for months, but he thinks maybe he won't need to stretch it out so long this time.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels somewhat useless standing by as the Wen remnants bustle around packing their belongings and surveying the settlement for other things they might want to bring with them. There's not much worth keeping, not much that can't be replaced in Caiyi Town with a little bit of coin that would hardly put a dent in what is available to Lan Wangji at any given moment. He knows, however, that what they built here is important to them, that for some things, sentiment is just as important as quality.</p>\n<p>Granny Wen insists on taking one of her flower plants. It's a sad little thing, but there's a single, lovely bloom on it. Lan Wangji wonders how much careful tending it took to get even that in this place.</p>\n<p>\"I'll dig it up and put it in one of the cooking crocks. I'll carry it with my own two hands if I have to,\" she insists when one of the younger women tries to talk her out of it.</p>\n<p>Few speak to him or ask anything of him. Wei Ying is occupied with following Wen Qing's every order, so Lan Wangji stands to the side and out of the way and helps with any heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>In the middle of all the commotion, Wen Ning approaches him.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Er-gongzi,\" he says with a bow.</p>\n<p>\"Wen-gongzi,\" he greets, bowing in return. When he straightens, there's a look of surprise in Wen Ning's expression.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi will not ask for anything special, but I know it would mean the world to him if someone brought one of the lotus plants with us. He worked hard to get them to grow and bloom and they were one of the few things that brought him any joy these last months. He misses his brother and sister terribly and they are a nice reminder of them for him,\" Wen Ning tells him.</p>\n<p>\"I will do it,\" Lan Wangji says immediately.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning nods and smiles stiffly. \"It will make him very happy. Though, he is already happier now than I have seen him since...before. I will get you one of Granny's pots and a shovel.\"</p>\n<p>Wen Ning slips away and returns a few moments later with the promised tools, then disappears toward the sound of his sister's voice.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes his way toward the small lotus pond. He has never dug up a plant before. All Lans are taught basic tending and harvest of medicinal herbs, but they never planted or transplanted them, only cared for them after they were grown. He has theoretical knowledge of plant anatomy and careful hands. Hopefully he can manage it without damaging the plant too much.</p>\n<p>In the end, he winds up with mud on the skirt of his robes, his sleeves, and his hands, but he has a largely undamaged lotus plant in a pot in one of his qiankun bags. He goes in search of some water to wash his hands with and encounters Wen Ning pulling a loaded cart toward the center of the settlement.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Er-gongzi, were you successful?\" he asks. There's an air of satisfaction and amusement about him that tells Lan Wangji he knew this would happen. The message is clear. Where Wen Qing was threats and anger, Wen Ning is a harmless prank, the results of which will make Wei Ying happy.</p>\n<p>\"I was,\" he replies. \"Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"My sister was right, you know,\" he says conversationally. \"He will not protect himself if he thinks it will help us or the Jiangs. So we must protect him. You must protect him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will,\" Lan Wangji promises. He thinks of the golden core now burning as bright as it ever did inside Jiang Wanyin, he thinks of how Wei Ying gave up his place in society, his place with his family, for the Wens. Lan Wangji will not allow Wei Wuxian to give up any more of himself.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Lan Er-gongzi,\" Wen Ning says with another bow and moves back toward the rest of his family, who are starting to gather in the center of the settlement.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is standing with them, laughing and speaking with a freedom Lan Wangji hasn't seen in a very long time. In the midst of it all, he looks up and meets Lan Wangji's eyes. His smile shifts and softens, but the joy in his countenance doesn't change as Wei Wuxian starts moving Lan Wangji's direction.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, did Granny make you help her with her plants? I've only seen you this dirty once before and that was under much more perilous circumstances,\" Wei Wuxian says when he's close enough to see Lan Wangji's robes in the waning light.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"It was worth it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Now, or then?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Both,\" he replies.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins. \"Ah, Lan Zhan. Always so good. Everyone is mostly packed up. I think it's time to eat, yeah?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods.</p>\n<p>\"When we're done, it might be best if you went back down to Yiling and got a room at an inn. The accommodations here are certainly not what you're accustomed to in Gusu. They're not even what you were accustomed to during the Sunshot Campaign,\" Wei Wuxian says and his eyes slide away from Lan Wangji's and off into the distance.</p>\n<p>\"If you would like one last evening with these people in this place you built together, I will go,\" Lan Wangji says. \"But I would rather stay here. With you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, how am I supposed to respond when you speak so earnestly?\" Wei Wuxian exclaims, but Lan Wangji doesn't miss him swiping at his eyes.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stays silent and waits for his answer.</p>\n<p>\"I would rather you stayed here as well,\" he finally says. \"But I have no nice beds or clean linens to offer. Just a stone slab and a ragged blanket.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says. \"You have survived here for over a year now. I can manage a single night.\"</p>\n<p>\"All right,\" Wei Ying agrees and wraps his fingers around Lan Wangji's wrist. \"Come on. Let's go join the others.\"</p>\n<p>The meal is lively, though everyone clearly misses A-Yuan dearly. Lan Wangji remains quiet, but he enjoys listening to everyone speak.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nudges him in the side with his elbow. \"Not going to scold me about talking while eating?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not tonight,\" Lan Wangji replies and takes a sip from the cup of water in front of him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs. \"So I can look forward to that resuming when we get home, then?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn't respond. He can't, not with the word \"home\" echoing through his head.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying laughs, and even here in this place where he can feel the resentful energy prodding at the barriers Wei Wuxian erected to keep it out, he can be nothing but content. It will be even better when they get back to the Cloud Recesses and A-Yuan is with them.</p>\n<p>As they finish eating, Wei Ying stands and tugs Lan Wangji up with him. \"We'll head out as soon as it's light,\" he tells them.</p>\n<p>\"Have you ever gotten up that early in your life?\" a man\u2013Uncle Four, Lan Wanghi thinks\u2013calls, voice teasing.</p>\n<p>\"Even if I haven't, Lan Zhan is with me and he's of the Lan Clan where they get up at an hour unfit for mere mortals every single morning,\" Wei Wuxian retorts, shooting a grin Lan Wangji's way. \"He'll make sure I'm up.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll bet he will,\" Uncle Four mutters into his bowl of wine.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels his ears heat and Wei Wuxian lets out a surprised bark of laughter. \"<em>Anyway</em>. We have a long journey ahead of us, but there will be horses waiting in Yiling. I hope that our last night in this place passes peacefully for all of you.\"</p>\n<p>As one, the Wens rise and bow respectfully, gratefully, to Wei Wuxian. Lan Wangji can hear him swallow.</p>\n<p>\"There's no need for that,\" Wei Ying says roughly. \"Please.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji murmurs and wraps his fingers gently around his wrist. \"Let them show their gratitude.\"</p>\n<p>Wen Qing straightens, but the rest do not. \"Not one of us would be alive without you, Wei Wuxian. Bows are the least of what we owe you.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shakes his head vigorously. \"I don't want you to <em>owe</em> me. You are...you are my <em>family</em>.\"</p>\n<p>\"And some families enjoy a little bit of formality once in a while,\" she says tartly. \"I know it's a foreign concept to you, but surely you've spent enough time with your Lan Wangji to realize that sometimes families bow to one another.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs and brushes over his eyes with his free hand. \"Fine. <em>Fine</em>.\"</p>\n<p>\"Now go,\" Wen Qing says. \"I know you haven't packed any of your things yet.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs again and turns his wrist in Lan Wangji's grip to take his hand and tug him toward the cave where he made his home.</p>\n<p>He starts grabbing up half-finished talismans, stacks and stacks of paper with notes Lan Wangji is certain should never fall into the wrong hands, and various bits of wood and metal and shoving it all into a qiankun pouch.</p>\n<p>\"Sit, sit, Lan Zhan. I know you're exhausted and it's already after eight,\" Wei Wuxian says and pushes him over to his bed. Lan Wangji sits without protest. He doubts he'd be of much help to Wei Ying in sorting this out.</p>\n<p>\"Most of this should probably just be burned. I'll sort it out if I have time. It can always be done later. Did I tell you what I've been working on?\" he asks as he flits from rickety wooden desk to stone slab workstation and back again.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" he replies. \"Tell me.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian chatters about the invention he's calling a Compass of Evil, about how he's trying to refine it from a basic, but useful, tool into something truly powerful.</p>\n<p>\"Testing is complicated because this place is so full of resentful energy, it either just spins or is completely still. Right now, I'm working on getting it to differentiate between ambient resentful energy and beings fueled by it. If I can get that, it will be easier to add more functionality after,\" Wei Wuxian explains.</p>\n<p>He shows Lan Wangji some of his notes and diagrams before packing them away. It all makes perfect sense, but Lan Wangji would never have thought to combine all those ideas into something functional like this. Even in its most basic form, something like this would save the lives of many, cultivator and non-cultivator alike. Wei Wuxian is so brilliant, so <em>good.</em> The fact that men like Jin Guangshan\u2013men whose greed and lust cause harm in every village they set foot in\u2013paint Wei Wuxian as a villain fills him with the kind of anger he rarely experiences.</p>\n<p>No longer, Lan Wangji vows to himself.</p>\n<p>\"I imagine testing will be easier in Gusu,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's smile goes crooked. \"Yeah, maybe. We'll see.\"</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Wei Ying picks up a piece of paper and his smile goes soft as he holds it up for Lan Wangji to see the characters for sun, moon, water, and wood repeating over and over in an unsteady hand.</p>\n<p>\"We started practicing calligraphy with A-Yuan,\" Wei Wuxian explains. Lan Wangji watches as he hesitates, then moves to put it on the pile of papers to burn.</p>\n<p>\"You should keep it,\" Lan Wangji says before he can set it down.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks up at him and blinks. \"Isn't there a rule on your wall about how sentimentality is useless?\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not sentiment to look back on the start of something in order to see progress that has been made,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"And that rule is not against sentiment as a whole, it is against sentiment which prevents a person from seeing the present clearly. You should keep it. A-Yuan will like to see it when he is older.\"</p>\n<p>\"All right, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian replies with a smile and moves the paper to the stack of things to keep.</p>\n<p>As Wei Ying keeps working, Lan Wangji looks around the cave. The first time he was here was a happy night for the Wens, for Wei Ying. Wen Qionglin was finally awake and as he watched Wei Ying smile and laugh with the Wen siblings, the chasm that had grown between them that night in the rain felt wider than ever. Wei Wuxian felt so far beyond his grasp and the walls of the cave and the dirty ground felt as if they were closing in on him.</p>\n<p>And the resentful energy of the Burial Mounds pressed in from all sides. He was horrified and terrified. He felt as if the only way to keep breathing was to leave.</p>\n<p>It feels different now. Perhaps because in the morning he will take Wei Wuxian and the people who have become his family from this place, but he thinks it is more than that.</p>\n<p>Here, Wei Ying lived the best life he could. He taught the boy who is like a son to him, he invented, he breathed life back into Wen Qionglin, he protected and provided for the people under his care to the best of his abilities.</p>\n<p>That was all true at the time, but Lan Wangji has had time to gain some perspective. The fact that he is here now is a privilege.</p>\n<p>He watches as Wei Wuxian packs his things and listens to him talk. He can feel the exhaustion of flying them both here begin to settle around his shoulders. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, trying to will it away for just a little while longer.</p>\n<p>The next thing he knows, there's a soft chuckle and a hand squeezing his shoulder. He's too tired to offer even a token protest when Wei Wuxian pushes him back and lifts his legs up onto the bed.</p>\n<p>\"You worked hard today, Lan Zhan. There's no need to stay awake any longer. Sleep now.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can only do as he's told.</p>\n<p>When he wakes the following morning, there's a blanket pulled up over him and Wei Ying is nowhere to be seen. He frowns and gets up. As he's straightening his hair, Wei Wuxian strides into the cave wearing not the simple robes he wore on the journey here, but a pair of striking, ornate robes he must have been storing somewhere in this cave. For the first time since the Wen Indoctrination, Lan Wangji can see Suibian clutched in his hand.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan! Good morning,\" Wei Wuxian says with a smile and gestures down at himself. \"It felt appropriate to leave this place as I came. But you'll want to clean up a bit before we head out. I'll take you to the spring.\"</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji returns to the main area of the settlement, the Wens are already gathered there. They have all put on robes that are much finer than those they were wearing the previous night. Wen Qing, standing next to Wei Wuxian with her head held high, is wearing the Wen Clan robes marking her as a direct descendent of Wen Mao.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji brings his hands together and bows to her, then to the others.</p>\n<p>The Lan Clan teaches that etiquette and adherence to ceremony and ritual are key guiding factors in life. It has never felt more true than it does now. This is an important occasion and it deserves to be treated with respect.</p>\n<p>\"We are ready, Hanguang-Jun,\" she says. He nods in response.</p>\n<p>\"Wen Ning, Wen Qing, lead us down the mountain,\" Wei Wuxian orders. \"Lan Zhan and I will take up the rear.\"</p>\n<p>They fall into line by twos and begin their descent.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is quiet. He doesn't speak as they pass the last of the greenery and through the barriers that allowed it to exist. He doesn't speak as they walk through the dead forest or beyond the spot where A-Yuan asked Lan Wangji to stay and he walked away instead. He doesn't speak until they reach the end of the path and the ancient stone carved with a nearly faded warning against all who might consider stepping foot on the mountain.</p>\n<p>He turns and looks back up the path and Lan Wangji turns with him.</p>\n<p>\"Even before we arrived, people spoke of this place as if it were a living enemy who killed all who encroached on its territory.\" Wei Wuxian's voice is soft enough that it will not carry further than Lan Wangji. \"When I fell, it would not let me die, and when I returned, it allowed us sanctuary. This is not a place anyone should have to live unless the need is most dire and I do not regret leaving, but it has been a friend to me and I can only feel gratitude toward it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I am grateful to it as well,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying turns and smiles at him. It's not his usual, bright smile, but it's genuine. \"Let's go home, Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>When they turn away from the mountain, the Wens are waiting for them a little further down the road.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, then,\" Wei Ying says to them. \"The stablemaster is waiting for us.\"</p>\n<p align=\"left\">They are mounted and ready to head out just as the city of Yiling is flinging shop doors open and market stalls are being set up for the day and children have come out to play. They all stop and stare as they ride past.</p>\n<p>\"Are those the Wens?\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that Hanguang-Jun?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>He's</em> the Yiling Patriarch?\" a woman gasps. \"I sold him turnips last week!\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian snorts.</p>\n<p>As they ride through one square, there's a man in black standing at a corner with a fistful of talismans. Wei Wuxian nods at him and grins.</p>\n<p>\"My apologies, good sir! The real deal is leaving now. You'll have to set up shop elsewhere if you intend to con anyone else into buying your shitty talismans,\" Wei Ying calls.</p>\n<p>The fake Yiling Patriarch sputters and slinks away as those around him start shouting.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tips his head back and laughs freely and brightly. Lan Wangji can't look away.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>When they finally reach Caiyi Town midday on the fourth day of travel, Wei Wuxian is deeply relieved. He hasn't been on a horse in a long time and he's sore in places he forgot he could be sore. He wants to see A-Yuan, soak in a hot bath, and sleep for maybe a century. He'll settle for a full night's rest.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says beside him. \"Brother will have food stores prepared, but the spices may not be to everyone's tastes. We may want to stop here and get some and any other things you think might be necessary.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels a pang in his chest. \"I suppose I won't be getting your cooking any longer.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will cook for you whenever you wish it,\" Lan Wangji replies softly.</p>\n<p>He smiles and does not tell Lan Zhan that he wishes it always. Every meal. For the rest of his life. He has no right to trouble Lan Wangji for any such thing, not when he and his family have already done so much.</p>\n<p>\"I can go to the market and pick up some things if you want to let the horses have a drink and some rest before we head up the mountain,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, hands Wei Wuxian some coin, and takes the reins of his horse.</p>\n<p>\"I'll meet you at the stables,\" Wei Wuxian says and walks to the market. It doesn't take him long to buy the things they'll want and he ignores the gnawing guilt at using Lan Wangji's money for something so ultimately unnecessary, but they haven't had some of this in a long time and the Wens deserve to be comfortable and happy.</p>\n<p>The stables are on the far side of town but luckily it's the right side of town, so they won't have to do any backtracking to get to the Cloud Recesses. When he arrives, the horses are still drinking and Lan Wangji is nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>\"Where'd Lan Zhan go?\" he asks Wen Ning.</p>\n<p>\"He didn't say. Just that he had a shop he needed to stop at and he'd be back momentarily,\" Wen Ning replies.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks, then shrugs. He probably needed more ink or something. Wei Wuxian goes up to his horse and scratches under its mane.</p>\n<p>They don't have to wait long. In the time it takes Wei Wuxian to pull out his water skin and drink, Lan Wangji is back, the stablemaster is being paid for his apples and for the use of his troughs, and they're back on their horses and moving again.</p>\n<p>As if sensing their riders' growing anticipation, the horses are a bit less placid than they have been, but it's nothing any of them can't handle. Even Granny just tuts and the horse settles again.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's own horse is a bit more unruly than any of the others. Lan Wangji sends him a questioning look, but Wei Wuxian can only shrug. By the time they reach the summit and the gates of the Cloud Recesses, his horse is snorting and tossing its head. It jigs to the side as the rest pull to a stop. Wei Wuxian forces himself to relax and give a gentle tug on the reins.</p>\n<p>Zewu-Jun and Lan Qiren are waiting for them. Lan Xichen has a gentle, welcoming smile on his face and Lan Qiren's expression is as neutral as he has ever seen it. Wei Wuxian presses his lips together and leaves the greetings to Wen Qing.</p>\n<p>They dismount and a herd of Lan disciples appear to take the horses away. Lan Wangji moves toward his family and the Wens gather behind Wen Qing and all bow. Wei Wuxian stands to the side and watches.</p>\n<p>\"Lan-zongzhu,\" Wen Qing says. \"We are more grateful than we can express for the kindness you are showing us.\"</p>\n<p>\"If following our sect motto many months late is kindness, then I fear we have strayed from our true path,\" Lan Xichen says and bows back to her. \"Welcome, Wen-daifu, Wen-gongzi. Welcome, everyone. If you will follow us, we will take you to the area we have set aside for you.\"</p>\n<p>They walk down a path that curves around the outside wall of the Cloud Recesses. Wei Wuxian falls in behind everyone and listens as Lan Xichen begins telling the Wens about their new home.</p>\n<p>\"While you will never be denied entrance for any reason, we felt that as you are not members of our sect it would be unfair to ask you to abide by the rules of the Cloud Recesses. At the same time, we felt it would not be fair to our disciples and disciples visiting for study if we made allowances within the walls of our sect. Therefore, we felt the best option would be to create a settlement for you just outside the walls. This area would be extremely difficult to get to via any direction other than going past the gates, so you need not worry that you will not be protected since you are beyond the walls,\" Lan Xichen explains. \"We have also extended our wards to encompass the land and Wei-gongzi is free to add his own if he so desires.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath and nods when they pause and look back at him. Even now, they look to him for protection, despite the fact that they are now in the care of people much better equipped to give it.</p>\n<p>When the group starts moving again, Lan Wangji does not. He waits until Wei Wuxian reaches him and falls into step at his side. They don't speak, but Wei Wuxian feels a little bit more settled as they round the corner and walk into a large clearing.</p>\n<p>There are tents enough for everyone already set up and a large pile of lumber and other building supplies to one side.</p>\n<p>\"We will, of course, build you homes and any communal buildings you wish for, but we thought it best to let you choose where you would like to build,\" Lan Xichen says.</p>\n<p>They scrimped and saved and toiled for months to get enough supplies for the shacks they built on the Burial Mounds. Now, spread out in front of him, are more and higher quality building supplies then they ever managed to get. And this is just the start.</p>\n<p>\"Is it not good?\" Lan Wangji asks low in his ear.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows down the bitter taste in his mouth and forces a smile onto his face. \"It's more than good. It's wonderful.\"</p>\n<p>It <em>is</em>. The Wens deserve this.</p>\n<p>\"Lan-zongzhu, this is more than we ever expected,\" Wen Qing says. Wei Wuxian meets her eyes and a look of understanding passes between them. He breathes out.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" he says quietly. \"Let's go get A-Yuan.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods and they slip away back up the path and into the Cloud Recesses. It feels strange to be going anywhere other than the medical pavilion, but A-Yuan no longer needs to be there.</p>\n<p>\"He's better, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says with a grin.</p>\n<p>\"He is,\" Lan Wangji replies as they turn down the path toward the home of Lan Simiao's family and Jing-er.</p>\n<p>The two boys are playing in front of the house as Jing-er's mother watches from a few feet away. Jing-er spots them first and points excitedly. A-Yuan whirls around and takes a running leap at Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\"Xian-gege!\" he cries happily as Wei Wuxian catches him in his arms and twirls him around. Something in his chest settles as he holds the boy tight. Lan Wangji steps close and puts a hand on A-Yuan's back. \"Hanguang-jun!\" he exclaims and leans forward to place a smacking kiss on Lan Zhan's cheek. The smile that graces Lan Wangji's face makes Wei Wuxian's stomach do a small somersault.</p>\n<p>\"Do you want to go see granny and Ning-gege and Qing-jie?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Yes!\" A-Yuan cheers. \"Can Jing-er come?\"</p>\n<p>\"Tomorrow,\" Wei Wuxian promises. \"If that's all right with Jing-er's mother.\"</p>\n<p>She nods and gives them a crooked grin. \"Put him to work building and get some of his energy out and it's a deal.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs. \"I'm sure we can come up with something.\"</p>\n<p>He puts A-Yuan down on the ground and takes his hand. A-Yuan automatically reaches up with his other hand and slips it into Lan Wangji's. Wei Wuxian takes one deep breath and they begin walking back the way they came.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan chatters the whole way back about his three days with Jing-er and his family. He boasts about how he wasn't scared at all, even though Xian-gege and Hanguang-jun weren't there because he had to be brave for Jing-er He talks about all the games they played.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is surprised and only slightly alarmed when he mentions that Lan Qiren visited.</p>\n<p>\"He asked me all sorts of things!\" A-Yuan says.</p>\n<p>\"Like what?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"'Bout animals and birds and plants and reading and monsters,\" A-Yuan replies. \"It was like a game.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you win?\" Lan Wangji asks dryly.</p>\n<p>\"I think so? He said I answered good!\" A-Yuan says proudly.</p>\n<p>\"Of course you did,\" Wei Wuxian says and sends Lan Wangji a questioning look over A-Yuan's head.</p>\n<p>\"Evaluation,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"For placement.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" Wei Wuxian replies. He hadn't actually expected that the Lans would accept A-Yuan as a disciple, not after offering the Wens sanctuary.</p>\n<p>\"Uncle would not have praised him unless he meant it,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can't help but feel a surge of pride at how bright this little boy is, at how, despite each and every disadvantage, he still answered Lan Qiren's questions well enough to earn praise.</p>\n<p>The moment they can see the settlement and the other Wens, A-Yuan pulls his hands away from them, runs straight into the center of his family.</p>\n<p>Whatever conversation had been happening stops immediately as they all lift him up and pass him from person to person, showering him with weeks worth of worried affection.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles as he watches. Maybe they can hold onto this joy now that they no longer have to work so hard for their next meal, now that the oppressive resentful energy of the Burial Mounds is no longer pressing in, now that they are safer than they have been since before the Sunshot Campaign.</p>\n<p>As the Wens celebrate A-Yuan's return to health, Lan Xichen makes his way over to them. \"Wei-gongzi, we were finally able to take inventory of the talismans you made these last weeks. Our disciples will be well-stocked on night hunts for a long time to come. You have my gratitude.\"</p>\n<p>\"It kept me occupied,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"I am at your disposal should you need anything more.\"</p>\n<p>\"We would be foolish to turn away your expertise,\" Lan Xichen says. \"But I'm sure you will want to help everyone get settled. We would not ask you to turn your attention away from that.\"</p>\n<p>Wen Qing breaks away from the throng and moves their way. \"Zewu-jun, you asked to examine A-Ning. Both of us feel that if it will help your position with the other sects, that would be acceptable.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen gives her a nod. \"Having spoken with him now, the rumors that have been swirling are almost entirely laid to rest for my part, and I believe even my uncle. QingheNie has agreed to support us, as has YunmengJiang. Even Jin Guangshan's sons will both speak in our favor, but...it would likely be helpful to have an official examination report to present.\"</p>\n<p>At the mention of YunmengJiang, Wei Wuxian feels his entire body go still. He can barely breathe. He feels a warm hand on the center of his back and turns his head to meet Lan Wangji's eyes.</p>\n<p>\"He's going to be <em>furious</em> with me,\" Wei Wuxian murmurs.</p>\n<p>\"But he will support you regardless,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bites his lip and forces himself to take a deep breath. Wen Qing and Lan Xichen are still talking, but he can only focus on Lan Zhan's warm hand for several long moments. At least until one of the other things Lan Xichen said hits him.</p>\n<p>\"Wait, did he say Jin Guangshan's sons? Both of them?\" he asks Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen smiles. \"I did. Your brother-in-law trusts his wife's judgement, Wei-gongzi.\"</p>\n<p>Whatever face he pulls makes Wen Qing chuckle. Really, any time he can make her laugh, even if it's at his expense, is a success.</p>\n<p>A second later, A-Yuan hurtles toward him, wraps his arms around Wei Wuxian's leg, and beams up at him. \"Xian-gege! You promised we could have a feast! Can we have a feast now?\"</p>\n<p>He lifts A-Yuan up and tosses him into the air, just to hear his shrieks of laughter. When he catches him and settles him on his hip, he brushes the back of his index finger over A-Yuan's nose. He's getting too big for such things, so Wei Wuxian must do them while he still can.</p>\n<p>\"I did promise, didn't I? What do you say, Qing-jie? Shall we have a feast?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"We have much to celebrate,\" she replies. \"Yes, we will have a feast. Zewu-jun, Hanguang-jun, you are more than welcome to join us.\"</p>\n<p>\"It would be our honor,\" Lan Xichen replies.</p>\n<p>After that, the new settlement descends into a flurry of work. Some are unpacking their things, others are starting to cook the food. Wei Wuxian goes wherever anyone points him. He lifts, he carries, he stirs pots. Lan Xichen was pulled away by a disciple, but Lan Wangji is here helping right alongside him. Finally, the bulk of the work is done and the food is starting to smell incredible.</p>\n<p>When Lan Xichen returns, the feast begins. The food is perfect. Uncle Four regales them all with tall tales that only get taller as the night goes on and granny sings them an old Wen folk song. Wei Wuxian accompanies her on Chenqing.</p>\n<p>He can't stop smiling. He may have mixed feelings about several parts of this, but at the end of the day, his people are happy, they are healthy, and they are safe. His brother is healthy and whole, and his sister is happily married.</p>\n<p>He is here with Lan Zhan. For once, for this night, the scales are weighted toward joy.</p>\n<p>He can tell it's getting toward nine when he glances at Lan Zhan next to him and catches him blinking slowly.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, almost bedtime for Lans, isn't it?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies. His lips are turned up in that soft, small smile that Wei Wuxian loves so much.</p>\n<p>\"Probably almost bedtime for Wens as well,\" Wei Wuxian says. Things <em>have </em>quieted down. Conversation is softer now and A-Yuan is fast asleep with his head against granny's shoulder.</p>\n<p>The end of the night is officially signaled by Wen Qing and Lan Xichen standing and bowing to one another. Wei Wuxian smiles and stands as well.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi,\" Lan Xichen says. \"Lan-daifu had some things he wanted to do in the medical pavilion, so we took the liberty of moving your things into the <em>Jingshi</em> with Wangji. I hope that's acceptable.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hadn't thought about where he might sleep tonight until this very moment. He supposes he assumed he'd take a tent here with the others, but he wouldn't be surprised at all if Lan Qiren wants him within the walls of the Cloud Recesses to keep a better eye on him.</p>\n<p>\"If it's acceptable to Lan Zhan, I will go wherever Lan-zongzhu would like me to go,\" he replies with a bow.</p>\n<p>\"It is fine,\" Lan Wangji says softly.</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" Wei Wuxian replies. \"Then off we go.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you would like to continue celebrating with the Wens, you should,\" Lan Wangji says, the smallest wrinkle between his brows.</p>\n<p>\"I think they'll be turning in shortly, anyway,\" Wei Wuxian says, glancing around at the steadily quieting group with a smile. \"Let's go.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Wuxian,\" Wen Qing says as he's turning away.</p>\n<p>\"Wen Qing,\" he replies and faces her.</p>\n<p>\"We are here, we are safe, we are <em>alive</em> because of you. Thank you,\" she says, then turns toward her brother, but not before Wei Wuxian sees her eyes get suspiciously bright. For once, he keeps his mouth shut.</p>\n<p>\"Goodnight, everyone,\" he says, lifting his voice just enough to carry to all the Wens, then turns toward the path back to the gates of the Cloud Recesses as they call out their goodnights to him. He waves over his head, then he and Lan Zhan follow after Lan Xichen.</p>\n<p>The paths of the Cloud Recesses are illuminated by moonlight and a few, scattered lanterns. Lan Xichen breaks off at one junction of paths. As he tells them goodnight, he gives Lan Wangji a look Wei Wuxian can't interpret for the life of him. People may say Lan Wangji is the more inscrutable of the two Twin Jades, but Wei Wuxian thinks they're wrong. Just because Lan Xichen's resting face is more pleasant doesn't mean he's easy to read.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji keep walking. And walking.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, is your home all the way to the back mountain?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Not quite so far. We are nearly there. I did choose it, in small part, for the privacy,\" Lan Wangji admits.</p>\n<p>They round a bend and pass through an open bamboo gate, then in front of them is a home tucked into a small clearing in the bamboo. There's a deck spanning the whole front of the house and Wei Wuxian can hear the sound of water from the far side of the clearing. As they move up the wide gravel path leading up to the steps, he takes in the stone lanterns, the decorative pines, the plum trees.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian loves it immediately, even in just the light of the moon. Perhaps especially in the light of the moon. He supposes he'll find out tomorrow.</p>\n<p>He follows Lan Wangji up the short staircase and through the sliding door behind him. With a wave of his hand and a small stream of spiritual energy, he lights the candles and lamps in the room.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks around curiously. It's very beautiful and very Lan, but in the same way that Lan Zhan is those things, so therefore Wei Wuxian loves it. He looks to the side and sees what is clearly Lan Wangji's bed. In the alcove next to it, a few of his things were obviously moved to the aside to accomodate a second bed, upon which rests a qiankun bag Wei Wuxian can only assume contains the things he left in the medical pavilion. It's a clear message that Lan Xichen expects this to be a permanent situation, not just for a single night before they can come up with another solution.</p>\n<p>\"I keep disrupting your life, don't I?\" he asks with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\"I have not regretted a single one of your disruptions,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian snorts. \"I think the you of those first few weeks we knew one another might disagree.\"</p>\n<p>\"He was wrong,\" Lan Wangji says easily.</p>\n<p>\"But now you have to share space with me,\" Wei Wuxian points out.</p>\n<p>\"Is that not what I have been doing for the last few weeks?\" Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, but this is <em>your</em> space, not the medical pavilion. This is your home, which you chose\u2013in part\u2013for the privacy,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"It's different.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying. I do not mind,\" Lan Wangji insists, and then his brow furrows. \"If <em>you</em> mind, I'm sure brother would be amenable to changing your accommodations.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian breathes out. \"I can be loud and messy and I prefer to sleep much later than you do and I just. I don't want you to get sick of me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I already know those things,\" Lan Wangji says. \"I will not get sick of you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" Wei Wuxian says and moves toward the bed. The qiankun pouch does contain all of his things, most of which somehow became his things over the course of A-Yuan's treatment. He certainly didn't <em>bring</em> all this. A-Yuan's toys and robes are also there and he can only smile.</p>\n<p>He owes so many people so many debts he can never possibly pay, his life is no longer his, but he cannot regret it. Not when his people are safe.</p>\n<p>\"You are welcome to stay up,\" Lan Wangji says as he reaches up and begins the process of taking down his hair. Wei Wuxian has seen it only a couple of times at this point, but it still feels different here in Lan Wangji's home.</p>\n<p>\"It's been such a long day, I think I may actually sleep with you tonight,\" Wei Wuxian says, then blinks and coughs. \"That is, at the same time as you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Whatever you want,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian holds in a snort. <em>If only,</em> he thinks.</p>\n<p>He sets the qiankun bag aside and takes off his outer layers. As he sits on the bed, he looks up to see Lan Zhan carefully untying his forehead ribbon and hanging it over a hook on Bichen's stand.</p>\n<p>Only once has he seen Lan Wangji remove his forehead ribbon, not even those first few days when A-Yuan was the sickest and Lan Wangji didn't leave the medical pavilion at all. He always kept it on and since he's such a perfect Lan with perfect sleeping posture, it hardly even became crooked in the night.</p>\n<p>Now, his forehead is bare, his hair is down, and his thousand layers of robes are gone, leaving only what he intends to sleep in.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's heart pounds in his chest. He has to swallow and look away before he starts babbling all the foolish thoughts running through his head. He suddenly, desperately, needs to do some pre-sleep meditation, but he's not in the habit and Lan Zhan would definitely question him if he did it now.</p>\n<p>He takes a breath and gets into bed as Lan Wangji does the same a few feet away.</p>\n<p>\"Good night, Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji murmurs as he douses the lights.</p>\n<p>\"Good night, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian replies and closes his eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji chose his mother's home, the <em>Jingshi</em>, as the place he wanted to live when he was given the choice, he didn't imagine anyone but his brother or uncle ever stepping over the threshold.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Wei Wuxian appeared in the Cloud Recesses and upturned Lan Wangji's entire world. With all the turmoil Wei Ying inspired in Lan Wangji, the <em>Jingshi </em>was his sanctuary. It was the one place he could go where there was no trace of him, where he could quiet his heart and mind and find some measure of what he believed was peace.</p>\n<p>And then Wei Wuxian was gone and instead of relief, all he felt was sadness. He was glad of the assignment from his uncle and brother, glad of the distraction. When Wei Wuxian found him on the road with the Yin Iron he tried to be annoyed, but his predominant emotion was relief. While they traveled together, Lan Wangji learned that none of his routines were so precious to him that Wei Wuxian disturbing them was all that irritating or upsetting. He learned that he enjoyed having a companion more than he ever thought he would. When Jiang Wanyin and Nie Huaisang joined them, all the petty irritation he was afraid Wei Wuxian would make him feel was suddenly very much present.</p>\n<p>Somewhere between that trip and those miserable three months when Wei Ying was missing, Lan Wangji stopped thinking of the <em>Jingshi</em> as an escape from Wei Wuxian. He started fantasizing about finding Wei Ying and bringing him back to his home, about nursing him back to health if that was needed, and then spending their time going on night hunts and living a regular life. For a few moments a day, he allowed himself to imagine a life without war, a life without horrible uncertainty about the future, a life with Wei Wuxian by his side.</p>\n<p>When they finally found Wei Wuxian, it felt as if those hopes had been scooped out of his chest and deliberately shattered on jagged rocks.</p>\n<p>Now, five days since he and Wei Wuxuan brought the Wens to the Cloud Recesses, he drinks tea and does his morning reading while Wei Wuxian sleeps a few feet away from him in the <em>Jingshi</em>. Those fantasies he once harbored as his escape from the horrible realities of life feel as if they are within his grasp. He can hardly imagine not sharing his home with Wei Wuxian anymore.</p>\n<p>The new routines they are building around each other are better than anything he had before and he cherishes every moment they spend together in this place. Those moments have only been at the start and end of each day, as they've spent each of the intervening hours helping the Wens build their settlement, but he can't think of better bookends for hours and hours of work.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes one of the noises that indicates he's about to wake up. Lan Wangji lets himself lift his eyes from his book and watch as Wei Ying scrunches his nose, pulls his blankets more tightly around himself and presses his face to the pillow. This goes on for as long as it would take Lan Wangji to read two full pages if he were bothering to keep reading, then Wei Wuxian sighs heavily and sits up and blinks.</p>\n<p>\"Morning, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says with his sleep-rough voice.</p>\n<p>\"Good Morning, Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"The bath is hot. I'll go get our breakfast.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" Wei Wuxian replies with a sweet smile as he stretches his arms over his head.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji carefully sets his book down on the table, stands, and makes his way outside and into the fresh air toward the kitchens.</p>\n<p>Every morning has started in much the same way and Lan Wangji loves it more than he could ever put into words.</p>\n<p>By the time he gets back to the <em>Jingshi</em> with their breakfast, Wei Wuxian is dressed and sitting at the table, his hair piece, comb, and ribbon abandoned on the table beside him as he holds a teacup with both hands and drinks. Lan Wangji sets the tray down, takes the hair things, and circles around behind Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, I think we'll finish the bulk of the work today,\" Wei Wuxian says as Lan Wangji carefully combs out his hair. Wei Wuxian hums happily and takes a sip of tea.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji agrees.</p>\n<p>\"There will still be plenty to do, of course, but a lot of those things will be much easier, now,\" he goes on, \"like growing vegetables. I had to cleanse the soil seven full times with four different methods before we could get anything to grow. We're lucky that's all it took.\"</p>\n<p>\"You should write it all down,\" Lan Wangji says and combs half of Wei Wuxian's hair back into a topknot. \"Your experience could be valuable for others who find themselves attempting to work land tainted by resentful energy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe,\" Wei Wuxian replies. \"I guess I'll have more time now, and I do have notes, but I should ask Zewu-jun if he wants me to do anything first.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns as he wraps the leather hair piece around the topknot and secures it with the bright red ribbon. \"I'm sure he would not mind you taking time to organize your notes formally before you ask him.\"</p>\n<p>\"We'll see,\" Wei Wuxian says, then turns his head to look up at Lan Wangji with a sweet smile. \"Thank you for doing my hair, Lan Zhan. Let's eat, yeah?\"</p>\n<p>They finish everything that can be done without a trip down the mountain for more supplies a little while after lunch. When A-Yuan realizes he won't get scolded for it anymore, he immediately latches onto Lan Wangji's leg.</p>\n<p>\"Can we go see Jing-er?\" he beseeches.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"Let's go speak with your grandmother first.\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan's answering smile lights up his whole face and then he's running off across the compound. Lan Wangji follows at a more sedate pace, but quickly enough to see when Wei Wuxian swoops in, grabs A-Yuan about the waist, throws him into the air, then catches him and spins him in a tight circle. A-Yuan shrieks with laughter and the smile on Wei Ying's face makes Lan Wangji's chest feel warm.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying schools his features into a scowl and growls, \"Arrrr the big, scary monster got you! Now you're my prisoner!\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan giggles even more. \"You're not a monster, you're my Xian-gege.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's expression softens. \"And you are my A-Yuan. Where were you running so fast, hah?\"</p>\n<p>\"We were going to speak with his grandmother and perhaps pay a visit to Jing-er,\" Lan Wangji says, coming to a stop at Wei Ying's side.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that sounds like a perfect activity for this afternoon, now that we're done with work for the moment,\" Wei Wuxian says and leads them to where Madam Wen is sitting with a needle, thread, and a bundle of fabric in her lap.</p>\n<p>\"Well, off you go, then!\" she says when they explain. \"Keep him for the night if you want. I think he's finally getting tired of me again. Misses his papas.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian beams at her, but doesn't seem to notice that she wasn't just referring to him when she said that. Lan Wangji very much does. He meets Madam Wen's eyes and she winks at him before tugging A-Yuan close and pressing a kiss to his forehead. \"Be good,\" she tells him.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan nods eagerly and grabs their hands, practically dragging them out of the settlement and into the Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>They go find Jing-er and spend the afternoon back with the bunnies. The boys are delighted and out here, isolated from the rest of the Cloud Recesses, Wei Ying doesn't stop smiling.</p>\n<p>When it is time to go, Lan Wangji can see Wei Wuxian's posture stiffening. He can see his genuine smile fading into something much tighter, something much less free, less <em>happy.</em></p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has no idea what to do about it. He hopes that maybe it's just today, that Wei Ying is in a strange mood that will pass, but he has a suspicion that's not the case.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Ying whispers as A-Yuan and Jing-er are telling Lan Simiao all about the bunnies, \"Are you <em>sure </em>it's okay if A-Yuan spends the night with us?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Lan Wangji says. \"Of course.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you're really sure...\"</p>\n<p>\"I am,\" Lan Wangji says. Of course he's sure. He doesn't know why he can't convince Wei Ying that <em>Jingshi</em> is only a name. It doesn't have to be the place's sole purpose. \"A-Yuan is always welcome anytime he wants or needs to be there.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are too generous, Hanguang-Jun,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head. If he were being generous, he would extend the same offer to Lan Jingyi. He is not doing that.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan is very excited when they don't go down the path to the medical pavilion or to the outer gate. He's eager and curious and It feels strange that A-Yuan hasn't been down this path with them yet.</p>\n<p>When they pass through the gate and into the <em>Jingshi's</em> courtyard, A-Yuan is already entranced by the little pond and the stream feeding it, by the plants, even by the bamboo forest on the hill behind the house as if the Cloud Recesses isn't full of similar things. Still, Lan Wangji supposes this is new and distinct in that it belongs not to a stranger, but to two of the people closest to him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is relieved when he lights the lamps and looks over to see some of the tension draining out of Wei Wuxian as he removes his shoes and helps A-Yuan do the same.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji holds out a hand to A-Yuan. \"Come,\" he says, and A-Yuan puts his hand in his and lets Lan Wangji lead him across the room and to a box set in a corner. He lifts the lid and inside are the remainder of A-Yuan's toys. He lifts wide eyes to meet Lan Wangji's.</p>\n<p>\"Those are mine!\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies. \"They will always be here for you.\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan beams and throws his arms around Lan Wangji's leg. He's nearly too tall to be doing that anymore, but apparently some habits don't break so easily. Lan Wangji brushes a hand over the top of A-Yuan's head.</p>\n<p>From where he's still standing near the door, Wei Wuxian makes an odd noise. Lan Wangji looks up to meet his eyes, but Wei Wuxian glances away.</p>\n<p>Instead, he crouches down and follows A-Yuan's careful instructions regarding which toys he wants to play with and how they're going to play with them. It doesn't take long for Wei Wuxian to join them.</p>\n<p>A little while later as Lan Wangji walks through the Cloud Recesses on his way to make their dinner, he thinks about how the only time he remembers playing so fancifully was when he was with his mother. It's very good that A-Yuan is allowed and encouraged to play in such ways.</p>\n<p>When he returns to the <em>Jingshi</em> with their dinner, A-Yuan cheers. He and Wei Ying are both settled at the table waiting. Wei Ying has already brewed a pot of tea, and the toys are all put away. It's sweet and considerate and while Wei Wuxian can be both of those things, something about it doesn't quite sit right with Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>Still, he doesn't complain. They eat dinner and it is quieter than he expects, but not the typical silence of a Lan meal. Lan Wangji would be astonished if both Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan could manage to be completely silent during a meal. Still, it's almost a relief when they finish. Sometime between the first meal they shared together and now, Lan Wangji has reconsidered his stance on that rule. He can see the utility of it, but here in his home with two of the people he loves most, it feels...unnecessary.</p>\n<p>After they eat, he settles down where he usually plays music and with a wave of his hand, Wangji appears on the table in front of him. A-Yuan's eyes go wide and he scrambles to Lan Wangji's side. He played a few times while the boy was sick, but not as much once he was well enough to actually observe.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian settles across from them and pulls Chenqing from his sleeve. Lan Wangji doesn't think anyone, except perhaps Wen Qing, has noticed that he rarely carries his flute on his belt these days. He knows why that's the case, that Wei Wuxian is attempting to appear as non-threatening as possible.</p>\n<p>The Wens\u2013the people who have the most reason of anyone\u2013to fear that flute clearly do not find it at all threatening. In fact, A-Yuan lights up when he sees it.</p>\n<p>\"Are you going to play too, Xian-gege?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"If A-Yuan and Lan Zhan would like me to,\" he replies.</p>\n<p>\"Please,\" Lan Wangji says as A-Yuan nods eagerly.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying grins. \"How can I refuse such enthusiasm? Lan Zhan, you start.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods and begins playing. As ever, Wei Wuxian listens for a few moments, then begins playing in harmony. When Lan Wangji shifts to the harmony, Chenqing picks up the melody. There are very few things he loves more than playing with Wei Ying, and playing purely for the pleasure of it, rather than for any important reason, is even better. They play song after song, until A-Yuan slumps into his side fast asleep.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pulls Chenqing from his lips and smiles tenderly. \"Little Man should probably go to bed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji murmurs and takes his hands off the strings and gently lifts A-Yuan into his arms and stands. Wei Wuxian smiles and starts playing again. It's soft and a little melancholy and Lan Wangji recognizes it instantly. He nearly trips as he moves around the table toward the beds.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had been so delirious, yet here he is, playing the song Lan Wangji sang for him in the cave so long ago.</p>\n<p>He keeps his footing and lays A-Yuan down on Wei Wuxian's bed. He carefully avoids thinking about how he would much rather this be A-Yuan's, and only A-Yuan's, bed.</p>\n<p>As he carefully removes A-Yuan's outer robe for sleep, Wei Ying keeps playing. Only when Lan Wangji has pulled the blanket up over A-Yuan's shoulder does he stop.</p>\n<p>\"That song,\" Lan Wangji murmurs.</p>\n<p>\"Pretty, isn't it?\" Wei Wuxian asks. \"I don't remember where I heard it, but it always makes me feel peaceful. I played it for A-Yuan every night when he had trouble sleeping.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows hard. He wants to tell Wei Ying it's his song, <em>their</em> song, but he can't find the words.</p>\n<p>\"You play it well,\" he finally says.</p>\n<p>\"Thanks, Lan Zhan.\" Wei Wuxian tucks Chenqing away.</p>\n<p>The rest of the evening is quiet so as to let A-Yuan sleep. When Lan Wangji begins the process of going to bed, Wei Wuxian does the same. He just shrugs when Lan Wangji raises an eyebrow at him.</p>\n<p>\"Seems silly to stay up when I'm trying to keep quiet for <em>two</em> people,\" he replies. \"And I already read as much as I wanted.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is doing the final portions of his nightly routine when Wei Ying slides into bed. From where he's standing he has a clear view of A-Yuan curling up against Wei Wuxian's side. He reaches up to untie his forehead ribbon. If he takes longer on the knot than he normally would, if he's more meticulous about smoothing it out so he can keep the two of them in his line of sight, well. No one will ever know but him.</p>\n<p>He watches Wei Ying curl an arm around A-Yuan and press a kiss to the top of his head. If he had any doubt before, in this moment he knows he would do absolutely anything for these two people who are so precious to him.</p>\n<p>\"Good night, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Ying whispers. \"See you tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good night, Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji replies, throat tight. \"See you tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>The next morning, Lan Wangji wakes up at the usual time. As he's getting ready for the day, A-Yuan wakes up and sleepily shuffles over to where Lan Wangji is attaching his jade token to his belt and leans against his leg.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji smiles down at him and brushes a hand over his hair.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, A-Yuan,\" he whispers. \"Would you like to get ready and help me make breakfast?\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan nods eagerly and Lan Wangji helps him wash his face, put on his robes, and do his hair. Wei Ying sleeps on as they slip out the door and toward the kitchens.</p>\n<p>The cooks are accustomed to him taking a small corner of their domain to prepare food for Wei Ying by now, but A-Yuan is new for them and they lose some time cooing over what a sweet little boy he is. A-Yuan blushes and hides behind Lan Wangji's robes. Everyone laughs and gets back to work then, so Lan Wangji pulls a stool close for A-Yuan and begin cooking.</p>\n<p>\"More red,\" A-Yuan says seriously as Lan Wangji prepares Wei Wuxian's bowl.</p>\n<p>\"You're right,\" Lan Wangji replies seriously, and adds more chili oil.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wakes up just as they're setting the tray down on the table. The smile that crosses his face when he sits up and sees them makes Lan Wangji's heart pound in his chest.</p>\n<p>Breakfast is the bright spot of the day. Everything after that isn't bad, so much as <em>off.</em> They go to the library pavilion in the afternoon. It feels oddly reminiscent of Wei Wuxian's time at the Cloud Recesses, except he sits at his table and reads. He makes notes. He doesn't once say Lan Wangji's name.</p>\n<p>The next week is much the same. Wei Wuxian relaxes some when in the Wen settlement or the <em>Jingshi, </em>but he is never fully himself.</p>\n<p>Once, what feels like a lifetime ago ago, Lan Wangji thought all he wanted was for Wei Wuxian to be quiet and stop bothering him. He'd been lying to himself then, and now it feels as if every time Wei Ying acquiesces to something without so much as a comment, every time something that would normally have garnered a reaction gets barely even a change in expression, every time Wei Ying makes himself smaller in order to fit into what he thinks life in the Cloud Recesses should be, Lan Wangji feels as if a vice is tightening on his heart.</p>\n<p>Every time someone asks something of him, he does it the moment they ask. Lan Wangji hasn't seen him working on any of his inventions, hasn't seen him writing any experimental talismans, hasn't once heard him say something absurd just to push a conversation in a direction he will find interesting. If he were to walk out the door one morning wearing Lan Wangji's robes, anyone who doesn't know him would assume he's a model Lan disciple.</p>\n<p>This is not what Lan Wangji wants for Wei Wuxian. This is not what he wants <em>from</em> him.</p>\n<p>The <em>Jingshi</em> was his mother's prison. Lan Wangji is absolutely terrified that Wei Wuxian feels the same.</p>\n<p>The next day, Lan Wangji is called to help his brother with something, so Wei Wuxian goes down to the Wen settlement without him. When he returns to the <em>Jingshi</em> late in the afternoon, Wei Wuxian is already there.</p>\n<p>He is seated in a position for meditation and Chenqing is on his belt. Lan Wangji can feel wisps of resentful energy coming off of him for the first time since he arrived here with A-Yuan weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" he says softly.</p>\n<p>\"Your uncle has very high standards, Lan Wangji,\" Wei Wuxian says tightly and opens his eyes. \"I could never meet them in a thousand years no matter how hard I tried.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Ying has not called him that since the hunt on Phoenix Mountain. Lan Wangji swallows. He has only ever called him that when something is wrong between them.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying, I do not\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"You asked me to come to Gusu with you once. I refused. Because I knew it would be like this. Because I knew it would slowly kill me,\" Wei Wuxian says and stands. \"Everything about it is a shackle around my neck.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can only watch, heart in his throat, as Wei Ying strides out into the waning daylight.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's hands haven't stopped shaking since he encountered Lan Qiren on the path in the middle of the Cloud Recesses. They shook as he took Chenqing from his sleeve and continued walking to the <em>Jingshi.</em> They shook as he sat and felt the anger rising in him, felt the resentful energy respond. It felt good to have something he knew he could control at the tips of his fingers, but his hands still didn't stop shaking.</p>\n<p>He can hardly remember what the horrible old man said to him. More of the same. How he's a terrible influence on everyone around him. How even the way he <em>breathes</em> is disrespectful. How nothing he touches will ever become anything good. How he will corrupt Lan Wangji; taint him with his wicked ways.</p>\n<p>It's nothing he hasn't heard before, but today...today felt different. He's been trying so hard to keep to himself. To be quiet. To be helpful. To work hard. To provoke no one. To make no unnecessary waves. He's been doing his best and clearly that's not good enough.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn't know what else he can do.</p>\n<p>And then, of course, Lan Zhan appeared and instead of feeling better like he usually does, he felt worse. So much worse.</p>\n<p>He presses the balls of hands to his eyes and takes a deep, shuddering breath, then takes Chenqing from his belt and tucks it back into his sleeve again.</p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes, he finds that he's on a path he has no memory of. He can't be far from the <em>Jingshi</em> as he can still hear the water of the stream they can hear when the doors are open. He keeps walking until he rounds a bend and in front of him is a wide, open area with a shallow pond in the center. He steps further into the clearing and toward the pond. The light is dimming rapidly, but not so much that he can't see a single lotus planted near the edge.</p>\n<p>As he looks closer, he sees evidence that someone has been tending this plant. It looks to be at the same phase of growth as the ones they planted at the Burial Mounds.</p>\n<p>He suddenly remembers Lan Wangji the night they packed everyone up as dirty as Wei Wuxian had ever seen him. He remembers asking him if he'd been roped into helping granny with her plants, but he realizes what he'd taken as confirmation was Lan Wangji being noncommittal so as not to outright lie to him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sinks to his knees in front of the plant. He swallows and takes a breath. It looks a little bedraggled, but it's clearly been taken care of with diligence. Wei Wuxian reaches out and runs his fingers over the lotus' leaves.</p>\n<p>He had enough self-control not to fire back at Lan Qiren, but he almost wishes he had. Maybe then he wouldn't have lashed out at Lan Zhan instead.</p>\n<p>His eyes burn and he presses his hands to them again.</p>\n<p>As the resentful energy around him dissipates entirely, he shudders.</p>\n<p>If he cannot make himself good enough for the Cloud Recesses, his only other possible recourse is to leave. Except there's nowhere he could go except back to the Burial Mounds. He doubts he'll ever be allowed to step foot in Lanling ever again, and he has been cast out of YunmengJiang.</p>\n<p>The hell of it is, he doesn't <em>want</em> to leave. He wants to stay here with the Wens. With A-Yuan. With Lan Wangji. He's just not sure he can without losing himself completely.</p>\n<p>He takes another breath and pulls his hands from his face. He reaches out to touch the lotus one last time, then gets up and follows the path back the way he came.</p>\n<p>When he steps into the courtyard of the <em>Jingshi</em>, it is Lan Xichen, not Lan Wangji, who is there waiting for him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stops and bows. \"Lan-zongzhu.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi,\" Lan Xichen says with a smile. \"I wonder if I could borrow a few moments of your time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course,\" Wei Wuxian replies.</p>\n<p>\"Did you know the <em>Jingshi</em> once belonged to our mother?\" Lan Xichen asks, turning to face the house in front of them. \"For all the years she lived in the Cloud Recesses, it was her home. It was her prison. This is what my uncle meant when he said he did not want Wangji to follow in our father's footsteps.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen tells him a story of murder, of miserable love, and a little boy kneeling in the falling snow waiting for a door to open.</p>\n<p>\"Wei-gongzi, I do not know if what our father did was righteous or correct. I do not know if our mother was ever happy here, if she was grateful to my father for saving her life, or if she resented him, hated him, for making her a prisoner. We were too young to understand such things when she passed and, as you might imagine, our uncle will not speak of the subject,\" Lan Xichen says, then turns back to look at Wei Wuxian. \"There is one thing I do know. I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that Wangji would not want the life our mother led for you. He would never, ever want this place to be your prison.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bites hard on the inside of his cheek and tries to hold Lan Xichen's gaze.</p>\n<p>A moment later, one of the doors to the <em>Jingshi</em> slides open. Lan Wangji emerges from it and moves their way. It takes Wei Wuxian a moment to notice what he's holding in his hand, but when he does, his mouth drops open.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji holds out two jars of Emperor's Smile to him. He doesn't even look at his brother, his sect leader, standing next to them. \"Come inside?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says and smiles. \"We wouldn't want to be out past curfew, after all.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tilts his head to the side and frowns and Wei Wuxian holds in a sigh. He hates when Lan Zhan is upset and he's been upset for days, but he hasn't said why. Wei Wuxian has been too much of a coward to just ask.</p>\n<p>\"We can stay out here,\" Lan Wangji offers. \"If you like.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at him. \"No, we don't need to\u2013it's fine, Lan Zhan. Let's go inside. It's starting to get a bit chilly, anyway.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji hums and turns toward the <em>Jingshi</em>. Wei Wuxian follows. It's only when he's pulling the door closed behind him that he remembers Lan Xichen was there with them, but when Wei Wuxian looks out into the courtyard, he's nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sits at the table, removes the paper and wax from a jar, and pours Emperor's Smile into the bowl sitting at his usual place at the table. Wei Wuxian sinks down and reaches for the teapot. He pours a cup for Lan Zhan and sits back again. He doesn't touch the bowl of alcohol.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, I\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying\u2013\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs a little and runs his hands down his face. \"Can I go first, Lan Zhan?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods and Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry. About earlier. I was angry and upset and you bore the brunt of it. I'm sorry,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"Apology accepted,\" Lan Wangj replies immediately. Easily. \"I hope you know that whatever my uncle said to you, I do not agree with him. He is wrong about you. About many things.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks down at the bowl of alcohol in front of him, at the jar sitting by Lan Wangji's elbow waiting to be poured again.</p>\n<p>\"I <em>am</em> tainting you,\" Wei Wuxian says and closes his eyes. \"If you would bring me wine and offer to stay out past curfew in front of your sect leader.\"</p>\n<p>\"My sect leader is also my brother and he understands that there are some things which the principles of the Lan Clan cannot guide,\" Lan Wangji says. \"No matter how many rules are added to the wall, they can never cover everything or every situation. It is the duty of each Lan disciple to be able to discern when and where their application is appropriate. That is a rule on the wall my uncle wilfully overlooks.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, the day we met, you pulled your sword on me for breaking the rules,\" Wei Wuxian reminds him.</p>\n<p>\"You deserved it,\" Lan Wangji replies with an expression that's almost a smile, then his expression turns serious again. \"Wei Ying, these past weeks...you have not been yourself.\"</p>\n<p>\"Myself is not acceptable in the Cloud Recesses,\" Wei Wuxian replies.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying, <em>you</em> are my soulmate. All of you. Every part,\" Lan Wangji says. \"Here, in the <em>Jingshi</em>, in your home, you need not...you can relax. You can <em>be</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's heart expands painfully in his chest. \"I wish I could, Lan Zhan, but I haven't had a home since I was six years old. Not really.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you still believe I will tire of you? Do you think I would cast you out?\" Lan Wangji asks softly, eyes cast down at the table. The hurt is writ plain on Lan Zhan's face, like that night in the rain, like that day on the mountain. Wei Wuxian wishes he had stayed away. Wishes he'd sat in the clearing with the pond and the lotus until after nine. Wishes he'd walked until he got to the walls of the Cloud Recesses and kept walking until he arrived somewhere he could never hurt Lan Wangji again.</p>\n<p>\"I think you wouldn't have a choice,\" Wei Wuxian says, finally. \"Your uncle will lose patience with me once and for all, or if things get bad with the other sects...the Wens must be safe. I'm expendable.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's lips part and he breathes out. \"You are <em>not</em>. Not to me, not to my brother. What must I do to prove to you that you are safe here? Safe with <em>me</em>? Please tell me. I will do it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says helplessly. \"I don't\u2013I don't know.\"</p>\n<p>A moment later, Lan Wangji lifts his eyes and meets Wei Wuxian's. There is a fierce stubbornness that wasn't present in his demeanor a moment ago and Wei Wuxian can only brace himself for whatever is about to come.</p>\n<p>\"What if we married?\" Lan Wangji asks. \"What if I made you my husband? You would be a member of my family. No one would dare part us.\"</p>\n<p>The world stops.</p>\n<p>For all he loved Jiang Fengmian like a father, for all he considers Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli his siblings, he has always been held apart from them. For all he considers the Wens family, for all he loves them and would do anything for them, at the end of the day he remains someone who took the lives of their kin. His own actions hold him apart from them.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is offering to tie himself to Wei Wuxian, to be his family. Permanently.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares into Lan Wangji's eyes. The stubbornness is still there, but now there's earnestness and <em>fear</em>. What could Lan Wangji possibly have to fear unless...unless he's afraid that Wei Wuxian will tell him no.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" he breathes. \"I\u2013\" he stops and swallows hard. His eyes burn and he lifts his hands to press his fingers to them. Without taking his hands away, he starts speaking again. \"You would give up the chance for your own children? You would sacrifice your\u2026your whole future, your reputation, just so I would be happier?\"</p>\n<p>Strong fingers wrap around his wrists and pull his hands down and away. Wei Wuxian's breath catches when their eyes meet.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says. \"How could it be a sacrifice when all I <em>want</em> is your happiness? When all I want for the future is to spend it by your side?\"</p>\n<p>\"But\u2013\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying, what do <em>you</em> want?\" Lan Zhan asks, searching his face. \"What would make you happy?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2013I want\u2026\" No one has ever asked him that, he realizes. Not earnestly. Not in such a way that whatever his answer is, he knows they will try to make it happen. Not like Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\"I want...to help raise A-Yuan, and I want everyone I love to be safe, and I want to be able to see my brother and sister again, and meet the future nephew my sister asked me to name. I named him after you, did you know? Jin Rulan,\" Wei Wuxian says all in a rush. \"But mostly...<em>You</em>. I want you. In every possible way. I want to be at your side every day and fall asleep next to you every night. I want to night hunt with you for the rest of my life. I want...if you also...if it's okay...I want to touch you and kiss you and love you. I just. I want you. My soulmate.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your touch is the only one that feels right,\" Lan Wangji says. \"I want it, Wei Ying. It is more than okay.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian scrambles around the table before Lan Zhan even finishes his sentence and throws his arms around him. \"Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan,\" he chants.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's arms come up to wrap gently around his waist. \"Wei Ying,\" he whispers in Wei Wuxian's ear.</p>\n<p>\"You really...you would really marry me?\" he asks against the skin of Lan Wangji's neck.</p>\n<p>\"I want to be your husband,\" Lan Zhan replies. \"And I want you to be mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Because you want me, too,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"Because I want you. Because I love you,\" Lan Wangji says. \"Because it would make official what we already are to one another.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian's breath hitches in his chest and he presses his face to Lan Wangji's shoulder.</p>\n<p>What would it be like to feel as if the <em>Jingshi</em> really is <em>theirs</em>? To feel like this isn't just a convenient place to put him, but it really is his home? What would it feel like to have his place at Lan Wangji's side assured? To know that whatever anyone might say or do, Lan Zhan would always be his?</p>\n<p><em>Husband</em>, he thinks and his chest feels tight. It's been so long since he even considered the possibility of such a thing. Not since long ago. Somewhere along the way he convinced himself he didn't want it, that he wasn't meant for this kind of love. He thinks maybe in his heart, once he met Lan Wangji part of him knew there could only ever be one person for him, but then...everything happened and it seemed impossible.</p>\n<p>But here he is in Lan Wangji's arms being offered everything he tried so hard not to let himself want.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" he whispers, lifts his head, and pulls back just far enough so he can look into his soulmate's eyes. \"Lan Zhan, let's get married.\"</p>\n<p>He's seen Lan Wangji smile a few times at this point, but this one is so unreservedly happy that all Wei Wuxian can do in response is lean in to press his lips to it.</p>\n<p>It doesn't last long. His joy bubbles up out of him and he laughs against the corner of Lan Wangji's mouth.</p>\n<p>\"You smiled, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"I'm happy,\" Lan Wangji replies and lifts a hand to cup Wei Wuxian's jaw.</p>\n<p>\"I think I've wanted this since at least the first time you smiled at me,\" Wei Wuxan tells him and kisses him again. \"Probably longer,\" he adds, lips brushing Lan Wangji's with every syllable. \"Definitely longer. Do you know how nice your lips are, Lan Zhan?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wraps a hand around the back of his neck and tugs him impossibly closer. Lan Wangji tilts his head and their lips slot together perfectly. He curls his arms around Lan Wangji's neck and lets all other thoughts leave him completely. This is all that matters in this moment.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian experimentally runs his tongue over Lan Wangji's bottom lip and is rewarded with a soft moan, so he does it again and again until Lan Wangji responds in kind. They kiss for what feels like hours, learning all the little things that make the other gasp and moan. They kiss until they're breathless and they have to pull back just to breathe.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji whispers. \"I want\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"You can have,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"Whatever you want of me, I will give you.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shifts and he suddenly realizes they're still on the floor in front of the table, that Wei Wuxian is straddling Lan Zhan's legs where he's kneeling and it can't be comfortable.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs and kisses his cheek. \"Maybe we should move, Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins and uses Lan Wangji's shoulders to push himself up to his feet, then reaches out to take Lan Wangji's hands and help him stand.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan immediately steps into his space and wraps his arms around Wei Wuxian again.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian smiles against his shoulder. \"How long have you wanted to hold me?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn't answer, just tightens his arms around Wei Wuxian's waist, presses his face into his hair, and breathes deeply.</p>\n<p>\"That long, huh?\" Wei Wuxian asks and closes his eyes. Lan Wangji is strong and warm and it's suddenly absurd that this is the first time he's been able to really appreciate it, that this is the first time they've kissed, that this is one of the few times they've touched each other in any way not directly related to helping one another. How much time have they wasted? Too much.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grabs Lan Wangji's wrists and moves his hands so they sit on the belt around his waist.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan. Touch me?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's hands clench on his waist, and then he meets Wei Wuxian's eyes as he starts undoing the belt. Wei Wuxian bites his lip over a smile and rests his hands on Lan Wangji's shoulders as he methodically removes Wei Wuxian's belt, then his sash. His hands barely even graze Wei Wuxian's skin over the fabric, but somehow it's still unbearably sexy.</p>\n<p>When he pushes the outer layers of Wei Wuxian's robes off his shoulders, they stop at his bracers.</p>\n<p>The look of frustration and embarrassment on Lan Wangji's face when he realizes what's gone wrong is so cute and funny, all Wei Wuxian can do is laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji huffs.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says with another laugh and leans in to press a kiss to the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>With Wei Wuxian's robes resting at his elbows, Lan Wangji wraps a hand around one of his wrists and turns it over. With a tug, he pulls loose the laces of the leather and lets it drop to the floor, then slowly, agonizingly slowly, <em>deliberately</em> slowly, he unwinds the cloth wrap, while keeping their eyes locked. When the wrap is gone, he lifts Wei Wuxian's hand to his mouth and presses a soft kiss to every finger, then the palm of his hand.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sucks in a breath and bites his lip.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji smiles then, a little smug, but a lot just happy and Wei Wuxian thinks he might melt into a puddle in the middle of the <em>Jingshi</em>. He gently releases Wei Wuxian's hand and takes the other. He repeats the same slow process of undoing the laces, removing the leather, then slowly unwinding the cloth wrap. He kisses each finger, the palm of his hand. Wei Wuxian tries to reach out, to pull him close and kiss him properly, but his robes are still wrapped around his elbows and he doesn't get a good grip.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Lan Zhan</em>,\" he whines.</p>\n<p>The smugness of Lan Wangji's smile takes over completely and his smirk is enough to make Wei Wuxian whine again. In response, one hand slides around the back of his neck, and the other to the small of his back. Lan Wangji tugs him until the only thing between them is a few layers of cloth. Wei Wuxian gasps as their hips align and he can feel that Lan Zhan is just as hard as he is already. He puts his hands on Lan Wangji's sides because they're the one place he can reach like this and he <em>needs</em> to be touching him, even if it's not his skin, even if it's not quite enough.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji whispers, and brushes their noses together before kissing him again and keeps kissing even as he pulls his hands away and finally takes mercy and pulls Wei Wuxian's outer robes off completely.</p>\n<p>As soon as his hands are free, Wei Wuxian immediately starts unwrapping Lan Wangji's sash. He has to break the kiss halfway through as he unwinds it, staring in disbelief as he reveals yet another layer under the last.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, how many layers are you wearing? Is undressing you going to be like solving a puzzle box?\" he demands.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji <em>laughs</em> and it's one of the sweetest sounds Wei Wuxian has ever heard. \"You like puzzles.\"</p>\n<p>\"I <em>love</em> puzzles, but they're best when I'm not preoccupied with the thought of properly touching my future husband's skin for the first time,\" Wei Wuxian retorts.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's lips part on a small gasp. He looks so beautiful and astonished, Wei Wuxian can only lean in close, \"Husband,\" he whispers against the soft, full lips he's been trying and failing not to stare at for years now.</p>\n<p>Apparently, that is the end of Lan Wangji's infinite patience, because he makes a gorgeous little noise in the back of his throat and as Wei Wuxian kisses him, he finishes the process of removing his outer robes.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pulls back and just <em>looks</em> at him. They've been essentially living together for weeks and weeks at this point, this isn't the first time he's seen Lan Wangji in his inner robes, but it's the first time he's let himself look his fill. The first time he knows it won't stop with looking. They're not going to get in separate beds and sleep.</p>\n<p>\"I love you,\" Wei Wuxian tells him, and knows he was wrong. Loving Lan Wangji is not a shackle around his neck, it is the only thing that makes him feel free, the only thing that makes him think that maybe there is a future for him despite everything.</p>\n<p>If the Cloud Recesses as a place has been difficult for him to adjust to, it is only because he imagined his presence at Lan Wangji's side was conditional, because he placed restrictions upon himself that no one who actually matters to him had.</p>\n<p>His hands wander to the tie holding Lan Wangji's inner robes together. The knot is neat and precise and he doesn't have to look at it in order to untie it, which is good because he can't seem to take his eyes off Lan Wangji's face. His eyes are soft and full of love and promises he hasn't voiced, but Wei Wuxian can see them all clearly.</p>\n<p>When he gets the knot undone he pushes the fabric aside, puts his hands on the warm, soft skin of Lan Wangji's sides, and steps close to press a kiss to his bare shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying. Please,\" Lan Wangji breathes and Wei Wuxian smiles and rubs his cheek against the place he just kissed before stepping back again and removing the inner robe completely.</p>\n<p>He reaches for the tie of his own inner robe and gets it undone and off with a flourish, then shucks his trousers off while Lan Wangji does the same.</p>\n<p>A moment later, they are entirely bare for one another apart from Lan Wangji's headpiece and forehead ribbon. Suddenly, he feels very foolish about every time he made a joke of it, every time he was flippant about its meaning.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji reaches up and carefully removes the silver headpiece, then dips his head forward, exposing the knot at the back of his head. \"Remove it for me,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows hard and hesitantly lifts his hand toward it. He doesn't deserve this, but if Lan Wangji is offering it, he will never make a joke of it again. He will treat it as the precious thing it is. He takes a breath, carefully unties the knot, and pulls it gently from where it's woven into Lan Wangji's hair.</p>\n<p>The moment it's off, Lan Wangji grabs his hips and hauls him close. This time when their hips meet, there's nothing between them. They both moan as their cocks brush together. Wei Wuxian wraps Lan Wangji in his arms. He's trembling. Maybe they're both trembling.</p>\n<p>They stand holding one another tightly for a long time, until Wei Wuxian laughs and starts backing toward the bed, pulling Lan Wangji with him. He takes a moment to hang the forehead ribbon reverently over the hook on Bichen's stand. When he looks back at Lan Wangji, his eyes are shining with tears.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan?\" he asks, and reaches up to cup his cheeks, brushing his thumbs over the skin under Lan Wangji's eyes. He shakes his head and nudges Wei Wuxian back and down onto the bed.</p>\n<p>\"I never dared to hope for this,\" Lan Wangji says so quietly Wei Wuxian can barely hear him. He settles himself down on his side next to Wei Wuxian. \"I was so afraid. I thought as long as you were alive, it was enough.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reaches out and takes Lan Wangji's hand and puts it over his heart. \"I'm alive. I'm here. I love you. I'm sorry I made you afraid.\"</p>\n<p>With one swift movement, Lan Wangji rolls Wei Wuxian onto his back and settles on top of him. Wei Wuxian laughs breathlessly and leans up to kiss him, relishing Lan Wangji's weight on top of him, his warmth, how their hips feel slotted together like they were made for one another.</p>\n<p>It takes a moment for him to realize Lan Wangji's fingers are tracing over the Wen brand on his chest.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian whispers and wraps a hand around the back of his neck. \"You really were worried back then, huh?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives him a flat look. \"I worried for you then, I worried for you when they took you away during the indoctrination, I worried for you when Wen Chao threw you down into the cave. I worried about the burn.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian kisses him. \"Sorry, sorry. I'm not used to anyone but shijie worrying about me.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sighs against his mouth, then trails his lips over Wei Wuxian's jaw. He sucks lightly at the base of his throat, then trails his tongue over his collarbone. He shifts down and presses his lips to the scar. Wei Wuxian sucks in a deep breath and threads his fingers through Lan Wangji's hair.</p>\n<p>\"So reckless,\" Lan Wangji whispers, and traces each line of the brand with his tongue. Wei Wuxian shivers.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, are you going to kiss every one of my scars?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lifts his eyes and Wei Wuxian knows that if he hadn't been going to do that, he's definitely going to now. He can only laugh a little bit. \"All right, Lan Zhan. Whatever makes you happy.\"</p>\n<p>With a satisfied huff, Lan Wangji pushes himself up to kneel in the vee of his legs and sweeps his eyes over his torso.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles and holds out his arm. It's the oldest one of which he can remember the origin. \"Dogs. Before Uncle Jiang found me.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cradles his arm and leans down to kiss each of the puncture scars. Wei Wuxian has never told Lan Wangji about his fear of dogs, but he's pretty sure he knows anyway.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian watches as Lan Wangji turns his arm over and presses a soft kiss to the corresponding puncture marks there. He has so many scars he's forgotten the origin of most of them, but the one on his inner arm near the dog bite is from when he first moved to Lotus Pier and he was helping his sister cook, one on his other arm from when a junior's arrow went wide. There's one just above his knee where he tripped and fell on the docks of Lotus Pier. Lan Wangji kisses every single one, those with stories and without. He runs his fingers over them like he's memorizing them, cataloguing them. Wei Wuxian shivers with every touch.</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji nudges Wei Wuxian over onto his stomach, he sucks in a breath at what he sees.</p>\n<p>\"Oh. I, ah, forgot about that,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"Zidian leaves interesting scars.\"</p>\n<p>He's relieved when Lan Wangji doesn't probe. He doesn't want to get into that, not now. Not when he feels so good, so...cherished.</p>\n<p>It's not until he's on his back again, with Lan Zhan's hands sliding down over his chest and to his stomach, that he realizes one final scar has been left out. It can only have been deliberate because it's rather unmissable with what they're doing.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" he whispers as Lan Wangji finally runs the calloused tips of his fingers across the length of the scar over his lower dantian.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lifts his eyes to meet Wei Wuxian's gaze. He's clearly gathering his thoughts. Wei Wuxian bites his lip and tries not to look away. \"You have given up so much of yourself for your family, for the helpless, to keep our promise. Wei Ying, I would never ask you to give up anything more. I never want you to feel like there is some way you must be in order to continue to keep your people safe or to be with me. I love you as you are. I hope, from now on, we can uphold our promise together. Any obstacle for you, is also one for me. Any burden you carry, is a burden I carry. Whatever happens, I will always be by your side. Whatever problems arise, we will solve them together.\"</p>\n<p>\"Together,\" Wei Wuxian says roughly, blinking rapidly. \"From now on. I promise.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can see Lan Wangji's Adam's apple bob as he swallows hard, and then he gives Wei Wuxian that soft, perfect smile that makes his insides suffuse with heat and lets his fingers drift over the scar again.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sucks in a breath when he leans down and lets his lips follow his fingers. There are probably thousands of dirty jokes and double entendres to be made about the lower dantian, golden cores, cultivation, and sex. Wei Wuxian has considered himself a connoisseur of them.</p>\n<p>No joke, no porn of any quality, no dirty story told in hushed voices in dark corners, nothing could prepare him for the reality of how it feels to have Lan Wangji's mouth brushing soft kisses over the scar that irrevocably changed his life. His fingers clench in the bedclothes and he gasps out Lan Wangji's name.</p>\n<p>He hasn't performed a single bit of magic that doesn't pull from the ambient energies in the environment in a long, long time. At this moment, it feels\u2013if he could only concentrate hard enough\u2013like he could reach inside himself and find his golden core again.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji grips his waist and moves his lips down to the cut of Wei Wuxian's hip. His hair cascades around his shoulders, brushing against Wei Wuxian's torso and his hands.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxin says and reaches out to brush Lan Wangji's hair behind his ear and tugs lightly at his ear until he lifts his eyes to meet his eyes. \"Can you...come up here? Much as I want your mouth on my cock someday very soon I want\u2013\" he cuts himself off with a breathless laugh. \"I want to hold you more.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji hums with a tender look. He doesn't move up immediately. He takes his time, kissing his stomach, over his chest, and up to his lips again. Wei Wuxian immediately wraps his arms back around his shoulders and hooks an ankle over his thigh.</p>\n<p>\"I love you,\" Wei Wuxian says against his mouth, then rolls his hips against Lan Wangji's. He's rewarded with a low moan he can feel in his chest. It makes him shiver all over. Quiet, controlled Lan Wangji doesn't seem to be holding back at all, not with him, not in this. Wei Wuxian bites his lip and reaches up to brush over the skin where Lan Wangji's forehead ribbon usually sits. \"You really are mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"And you are mine,\" Lan Wangji says roughly and presses his lips to Wei Wuxian's palm. \"Wei Ying.\"</p>\n<p>A sound that's half a laugh, half a sob bubbles up in Wei Wuxian's throat and he wraps himself even more tightly around Lan Wangji and starts to move his hips in a steady rhythm. \"There are so many things, Lan Zhan. So many things I want with you.\"</p>\n<p>So many things he had thought he gave up any chance of ever getting the moment his golden core left his body.</p>\n<p>\"You may have them,\" Lan Wangji pants in his ear and moves with him. \"Everything in my power to give.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, I\u2013\" he breaks off with a moan as Lan Wangji's mouth finds his neck and their cocks slide together. \"I have nothing to give but myself, but every bit of me is yours.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are all I need,\" Lan Wangji tells him seriously and Wei Wuxian gives up the battle against his tears.</p>\n<p>He kisses Lan Wangji through them. They hold one another as tightly as they can and move together until their breath comes in gasps. Wei Wuxian can feel the pleasure coiling inside him, hot and intense in the place where his magic used to be. When he comes, shuddering and gasping and Lan Wangji follows a moment later, he knows that what's between them is more powerful than any magic.</p>\n<p>He feels a smile stretch across his face as he catches his breath. This feels like a dream, like in a little while he'll wake up in his own bed, feeling empty and more tired than when he went to sleep. There's a sticky mess between them that proves this is very, very real.</p>\n<p>Which means the discovery he made just before he came back is real as well.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan,\" he says and Lan Wangji lifts his head. His eyes are shining with happiness. Wei Wuxian has to kiss him before he can finish what he was going to say. \"Earlier, when I left, I found a path to a clearing I hadn't seen before. In a little pond, I found a lotus plant. Did you bring it and plant it here?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji replies and his ears turn adorably pink. \"I was going to show you when I was sure it could thrive here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'm pretty good at getting lotuses to bloom in unlikely places. Maybe we can get it to blossom together?\" Wei Wuxian suggests.</p>\n<p>\"Together,\" Lan Wangji promises and leans in to kiss him. Wei Wuxian smiles against his lips and curls his arms around Lan Wangji's neck. He honestly can't think of anything better.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>The day the heir to LanlingJin, his wife, and their son are expected to arrive in the Cloud Recesses, Wei Wuxian wakes up with his husband.</p>\n<p>\"It's so early,\" he whines, sitting up and pulling the blanket tight around his shoulders. \"Lan Zhan, how do you get up this early every single day?\"</p>\n<p>\"A lifetime of practice,\" Lan Wangji says dryly. \"You could go back to sleep.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shakes his head. \"I couldn't. My shijie will be here this afternoon! With Jin Ling! How could I sleep any longer?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji rolls his eyes, but he leans down to press a kiss to the top of Wei Wuxian's head. \"Then get up properly and I will make tea.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have a better idea,\" Wei Wuxian says and snakes his arms around his husband's waist.</p>\n<p>\"It is a very compelling idea,\" Lan Wangji says, sounding amused. \"But I do need to help my brother with preparations for the Jin retinue's arrival shortly.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian heaves a heavy sigh and presses his face to Lan Wangji's stomach. \"I suppose that's important.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mn,\" Lan Wangji responds and runs his fingers gently through Wei Wuxian's hair. \"Go fetch A-Yuan. You will do a fine job of occupying one another for the morning.\"</p>\n<p>\"Probably a good idea. I'm sure granny is going to have a whole production for making the xiaolongbao and we're both banned from helping,\" Wei Wuxian says with a laugh, then lifts his head to look up at Lan Wangji. \"Do I need to get anything for him to spend the next couple of days with us?\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head. \"We have everything.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"Okay, I'm getting up. I'm dressing. You're making tea. I'm not dragging you back into bed, no matter how much I want to because I am a responsible adult and your brother deserves all the help we can give him today.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not a hardship for him to welcome your family for a visit,\" Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\"Our family,\" Wei Wuxian reminds him with a grin. \"Well. I'll claim shijie and A-Ling. Jin Zixuan is still on thin ice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your sister has been happily married to him for two years now,\" Lan Wangji points out.</p>\n<p>\"Which means he's two years closer to gaining my approval,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"He made her cry. Multiple times. That's at least ten years of being a perfect husband and father before I'll forgive him.\"</p>\n<p>\"If he <em>is</em> a good husband, I imagine he'll think that's fair,\" Lan Wangji says, tone shading into something more serious.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, you've never made me cry,\" Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\"Haven't I?\" Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>\"Not like that. Not...not on purpose and not out of sheer stupidity,\" Wei Wuxian replies. \"Besides, I don't need you to be perfect, I just need you to be mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Wangji says and brushes his hand through Wei Wuxian's hair again. He doesn't need to say anything. Wei Wuxian knows by the look in his eyes that the sentiment is returned. He catches one of Lan Wangji's hands and kisses his palm, then looks up at him expectantly. Lan Wangji takes a step back and helps him to his feet and presses a sweet kiss to his lips before letting go and moving toward the hearth to heat the water for tea.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tightens his inner robes and shrugs on his outer robes. Before he can attempt to work out all the layering and put his sashes on properly, Lan Wangji's arms snake around his waist from behind. Wei Wuxian smiles and leans back against his husband's chest.</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan, have you changed your mind about my ideas?\" Wei Wuxian asks.</p>\n<p>\"Hm,\" Lan Wangji hums. \"I like when you are up with me in the mornings.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reaches up to cup Lan Wangji's jaw and turns his face to kiss his cheek.</p>\n<p>\"I like being up with you,\" he says. \"But I like our regular mornings, too. A compromise, Lan er-gege? This won't work today, but I'll get up with you every morning that we can come back here in the middle of the day and get very naked and you can make me shout your name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mark your words,\" Lan Wangji agrees, warm and low in his ear.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs breathlessly. \"Consider them marked. Are you going to help me finish dressing or are you going to get the tea?\"</p>\n<p>\"I will get the tea,\" Lan Wangji replies, but he doesn't move just yet. He presses a soft kiss to the side of Wei Wuxian's neck and holds him close for several long moments before pulling back. Wei Wuxian smiles at nothing as he ties his sash. He keeps smiling as he combs out his hair and pulls it up into the silver guan that marks his status as the husband of Lan Wangji. It is the one concession he has made with regard to his appearance. Lan Wangji likes him in black, likes his red underrobes and ribbons, but it makes him happy to have a visible marker that Wei Wuxian is his.</p>\n<p>They serve one another tea and linger over it only a little bit, then step out of their home and into the bright, beautiful morning. Wei Wuxian rarely sees the Cloud Recesses at this time of day, though he has the distinct feeling he's going to be seeing it more. He grins and slides his hand into Lan Wangji's. As he always does, Lan Zhan laces their fingers together as they walk down the paths away from the <em>Jingshi</em> toward the main buildings.</p>\n<p>\"Send for me if you need me,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"A-Yuan and I will come running.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji smiles softly and inclines his head. Wei Wuxian rocks forward on the balls of his feet and presses a kiss to his mouth, then forces himself to step back and away. Maybe it's silly how reluctant he is to leave Lan Wangji's side even now, but he knows his husband feels the same, so he refuses to care if it's silly or not.</p>\n<p>When he walks into the Wen settlement, he's immediately treated to a raised eyebrow from Wen Qing.</p>\n<p>\"Did you sleep?\" she asks.</p>\n<p>\"Of course I did,\" he replies, taken aback. \"Why wouldn't I have slept? Do I look like I haven't slept? I can't have my shijie worrying over nothing.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's just I didn't know you knew this hour even existed unless you saw it from the wrong end,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes. \"I slept. Do you think Lan Zhan would have let me stay up all night?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it would be very easy for you to convince him of anything,\" she replies. \"But no, you look fine. Since you're here, you can go wake A-Yuan and help make him presentable.\"</p>\n<p>\"That was my plan,\" he says. \"Now stop telling me to do things because you just make me not want to do things.\"</p>\n<p>She huffs. \"I never have this problem with A-Ning.\"</p>\n<p>\"Because Wen Ning is good and I am contrary, Qing-Jie,\" he says over his shoulder as he turns toward the little house Granny Wen lives in with A-Yuan on the nights he stays with the Wens.</p>\n<p>They tend to let him stay where whim takes him, though Wei Wuxian expects that when he starts classes with the other children his age he'll stay with them a bit more often. Granny Wen isn't the late riser Wei Wuxian is, but she certainly doesn't prefer to get up when the Lan disciples wake for the day.</p>\n<p>He slips into the house and finds A-Yuan is already awake and playing quietly with his grass butterflies.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, little man,\" Wei Wuxian whispers and kisses his brow. \"Why are you awake so early?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm excited!\" he replies in a whisper loud enough he could wake the dead if he got the note just right. \"I get to meet A-Ling and guma and gufu!\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins and very valiantly does not tell A-Yuan that his gufu isn't anyone worth meeting.</p>\n<p>\"I'm excited, too,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"Now, let's get your face washed and your robes on, so we can let your nainai sleep.\"</p>\n<p>They move quickly and even manage to remain quiet while they do it.</p>\n<p>\"Now,\" he says, taking A-Yuan's hand, \"let's get you some breakfast, and then we can practice our song for A-Ling, all right?\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan eats his breakfast way too fast, but Wei Wuxian can't bring himself to scold him for it. Not today.</p>\n<p>He pulls A-Yuan's nanxiao from his belt where he tucked it next to Chenqing and they sit themselves down next to where Wen Qing is preparing medicinal herbs to dry them.</p>\n<p>\"Let's show your Auntie Qing how much you've practiced since your last lesson with her,\" Wei Wuxian instructs.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lifts Chenqing to his mouth and begins them on the song they've been practicing for Jin Ling. As they play, Wen Ning wanders over and sits down next to his sister. When they finish, Wen Qing claps and tugs A-Yuan forward for a hug. \"You're doing so well! Soon you'll know all I have to teach you, won't you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Never!\" A-Yuan declares and throws his arms around her neck. Wen Ning grins broadly at her side.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian spins Chenqing on his fingers and grins up at the blue sky. It's only right that the weather would be perfect for the day his shijie and her family arrive. His only regret is that Jiang Cheng can't be here as well, but sect business is keeping him in Yunmeng this time.</p>\n<p>He lifts Chenqing back up and starts playing a soft, lilting song while A-Yuan chatters to his family about practicing his flute, which segues into him chattering about how Lan Zhan has started teaching him guqin, even though he's already told them about it at least five times and even witnessed the tail end of a lesson when they came to the <em>Jingshi</em> for tea one day.</p>\n<p>They spend the morning alternating between practicing, playing other things for fun or just to make noise, and staying out of the way when the preparation of the xiaolongbao begins. Wei Wuxian is thoroughly distracted because he's surprised when Wen Ning brings them lunch.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji arrives to fetch them mid-afternoon.</p>\n<p>\"Is it already time, Lan Zhan?\" he asks, leaning in to steal a quick kiss.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji inclines his head and bends down to straighten A-Yuan's robes, then reaches out to pat down Wei Wuxian's collars. \"They will arrive shortly.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Wei Wuxian's heart is in his throat. This will be the first time he's seen Jiang Yanli since just before her wedding. There were a few months after he and the Wens arrived in the Cloud Recesses when he feared that, despite everything, he still wouldn't be able to see her again. But Lan Xichen is a good sect leader and a good brother-in-law who put in many hours over the course of many months traveling to Lanling and back in order to smooth Jin Guangshan's ruffled feathers, and, by extension, those of all the sect leaders loyal to him.</p>\n<p>\"You know she will be thrilled to see you,\" Lan Wangji says, low enough that only Wei Wuxian can hear.</p>\n<p>\"I know, I know,\" Wei Wuxian replies and takes a breath. He moves to tuck Chenqing into his sleeve, but Lan Wangji stops him with a hand and puts the flute in his belt instead.</p>\n<p>\"It is part of you,\" Lan Wangji says and laces their fingers together, then reaches out to take A-Yuan's hand as well. \"Come. Brother will be waiting.\"</p>\n<p>It's not the first time Wei Wuxian has participated in an official Lan Sect ceremony, but it's the first time he's been <em>invested</em> in it. This is for more than to support his brother-in-law or make Lan Wangji happy.</p>\n<p>They wait in the Orchid Room and Wei Wuxian only manages to keep from vibrating out of his skin because as soon as they're lined up, A-Yuan turns and hides his face in Lan Wangji's skirts. Wei Wuxian crouches down and pinches his cheek.</p>\n<p>\"Are you nervous, little man?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" A-Yuan replies, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\"Do not lie, A-Yuan,\" Lan Wangji instructs softly and brushes his hand over A-Yuan's hair.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay if you are,\" Wei Wuxian says. \"I am, too.\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan peeks over at him. \"Really, Xian-gege?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" he replies. \"I bet even Zewu-Jun gets nervous sometimes at these kinds of things.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's true,\" Lan Xichen says from the other side of Lan Wangji with a smile for A-Yuan. \"Meeting people I haven't talked with before always makes me a little bit nervous.\"</p>\n<p>\"See?\" Wei Wuxian says and gently turns him back so he's facing forward. \"So the thing to do is know that you're nervous, but decide to be brave anyway. Can you do that for us?\"</p>\n<p>A-Yuan nods slowly and Wei Wuxian brushes his hands over his shoulders and straightens his robes for the third time.</p>\n<p>\"Good boy,\" he says and kisses A-Yuan on the forehead before standing up again. Suddenly, his own nervousness is gone and the excitement of seeing Jiang Yanli again and of meeting Jin Ling takes over.</p>\n<p>A few moments later, the Jin entourage is led into the room by two Lan disciples. Wei Wuxian only has eyes for his sister and the baby in her arms. Her eyes light up when she sees him and he's almost glad of all the bowing and desperately boring formal greetings because it means he has a chance to get his emotions under control a little bit. Looking at Jin Zixuan's face also helps.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji, of course, notices and squeezes his hand behind the flurry of robes. Finally, finally, the formalities are through and his sister is standing in front of him.</p>\n<p>\"A-Xian,\" she says softly, with a smile on her face that has always made him feel completely safe and at home. \"I'm so very happy to see you.\"</p>\n<p>\"You too, Madam Jin,\" he replies, heart in his throat.</p>\n<p>\"A-Xian, none of that,\" she scolds gently. \"You are still my didi. Now, would you like to meet your nephew?\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods, unable to say a word because he knows if he does, he'll just start crying. He feels Lan Wangji's warm hand at the small of his back and takes a breath as Jiang Yanli passes Jin Ling into his arms.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, little one. I'm your da-jiu,\" he whispers and brushes his finger over Jin Ling's soft cheek. \"How is he still asleep through all this commotion?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"He does not like to go to sleep. He fights it and fights it, but when he finally does, nothing can wake him,\" Jiang Yanli replies with a fond smile.</p>\n<p>\"Look, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian says and lets himself lean back against his husband. \"Look at our nephew.\"</p>\n<p>He feels a tug at his robe and looks down to see A-Yuan looking up at them. \"Can I see the baby?\" he whispers.</p>\n<p>\"You must be A-Yuan,\" she says and crouches down next to him.</p>\n<p>\"Are you...my guma?\" he asks.</p>\n<p>\"I am,\" she replies with a bright smile. \"I'm so happy to meet you. Of course you can see A-Ling. You can even hold him if you're very careful.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know how to be careful,\" A-Yuan says proudly.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't teach him that,\" Wei Wuxian says ruefully. \"That was Lan Zhan and Wen Qing.\"</p>\n<p>She laughs and straightens up, taking A-Yuan's hand in hers. \"A-Xian has other talents. Is there somewhere we can go to catch up?\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods eagerly. \"Lan Zhan and I built a little garden by our house. It's a really nice place to have tea.\"</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji leads the way through the Cloud Recesses with Jin Zixuan. Part of Wei Wuxian wants to listen to their conversation because he <em>knows </em>it's probably hilariously awkward on both sides, but his sister is next to him talking to A-Yuan and baby Jin Ling is in his arms, so he doesn't try too hard.</p>\n<p>\"I'm so glad you're happy, A-Xian,\" Jiang Yanli says softly. \"I know it wasn't possible for many reasons, but I'm so sorry I missed your wedding. I hope it was lovely.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was, shijie. It...I never thought\u2013\" he cuts himself off with a little laugh. \"I don't know where I would be without Lan Zhan.\"</p>\n<p>\"He loves you very much,\" she says. \"I've known since he kept coming to play for you when you couldn't wake up.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles. \"I was such a fool back then. I'm very lucky he's so patient.\"</p>\n<p>They turn up the path toward the garden and when it opens up to the clearing, Jiang Yanli gasps in delight. \"A-Xian, it's beautiful.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lan Zhan started it. We had lotuses at the Burial Mounds and when we went to bring everyone back here, he brought one with him and planted it and took care of it until it was able to really take root and, well, you see what we have now,\" Wei Wuxian says, grinning.</p>\n<p>He loves this garden. There's a covered platform where they can sit, rain or shine, and enjoy the garden. He loves that it started as Lan Wangji trying to give him something lovely and became something they built together with their own hands.</p>\n<p>\"A-Xuan did that for me,\" Jiang Yanli says, looking at her husband with a soft smile. \"There are now lotuses in some of the ponds at Koi Tower.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is saved from having to think anything positive about Jin Zixuan by Jin Ling waking up and immediately starting to cry.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, you want your mama, don't you? I completely understand,\" Wei Wuxian says. He gives Jin Ling a kiss on the top of his head before passing him back to Jiang Yanli.</p>\n<p>They make their way to the platform and sit while Jiang Yanli soothes her son. Jin Zixuan sits next to her and holds out Suihua's hilt so Jin Ling can see it. Jin Ling immediately stops crying and reaches out his hand to touch the sword.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, tugs A-Yuan up onto his lap, and leans into Lan Wangji's side. He's rewarded with an arm sliding around his waist. \"Careful, there. This one teethed on Chenqing. All these marks? Not from any battle, but from baby teeth.\"</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan stares for a moment, then snorts and shakes his head. \"I'll keep that in mind.\"</p>\n<p>It might be the first marginally positive interaction they've had. Hopefully someday soon he can gag about it with Jiang Cheng, but he supposes it's not a bad thing.</p>\n<p>They sit and talk. Lan Zhan pours everyone tea and eventually, Wei Wuxian has Jin Ling in his lap again.</p>\n<p>\"Now, you need to remember that I'm the fun uncle,\" he tells his nephew seriously, \"but don't think that just because I'm fun means I'll let you get away with anything. If I catch you, you weren't doing it right.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying,\" Lan Zhan says in that tone where Wei Wuxian knows he's both exasperated and deeply amused.</p>\n<p>\"Fine, fine,\" he says, waving a hand. \"Hanguang-Jun will probably catch you even if I don't. He always catches me and I'm <em>very</em> good at not getting caught.\"</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli lets out a merry laugh and Wei Wuxian can only grin at her.</p>\n<p>\"A-Xian,\" Jiang Yanli says when her laughter stops. \"I have something for you from A-Cheng.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lifts his eyes from Jin Ling to look at Jiang Yanli. He honestly has no idea what Jiang Cheng could possibly give him. They've never been much for gift-giving between them and they're just now starting to write to one another again after months of frequent contact with Lan Xichen regarding the politics of the Lan Sect's decision about the Wens and Wei Wuxian, and pointed silence toward Wei Wuxian himself.</p>\n<p>She pulls a box from her sleeve and Wei Wuxian hands Jin Ling over to his father so he can take it from her. He sits back down next to Lan Wangji and gently lifts the lid. Inside, nestled in purple velvet, is a Jiang Sect clarity bell attached to a jade token with a purple tassel. He swallows hard and bites the inside of his cheek.</p>\n<p>\"Your home may be the Cloud Recesses now, and mine might be Koi Tower, but we will always be from the Jiang Sect of Yunmeng,\" Jiang Yanli says softly. \"Someday soon, I hope we can all be there again together for a little while.\"</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods and has to take a deep breath before he can respond. \"Yes, shijie.\"</p>\n<p>He feels Lan Wangji's hand settle on his back, leans into the touch, and watches with tears in his eyes as his sister helps A-Yuan sit between her and Jin Zixuan and then puts Jin Ling in his lap.</p>\n<p>Abruptly, he realizes that he almost didn't have this. By all rights, he should still be at the Burial Mounds attempting to grow and sell vegetables. Or probably dead.</p>\n<p>He didn't expect to ever see his sister again. He didn't expect he'd ever be able to meet her son, the boy he named. He didn't expect that A-Yuan would ever be able to meet any of them. He didn't expect they would all be safe and healthy and protected.</p>\n<p>He thought that one time in Yiling was the last time he would ever see Lan Zhan. Yet, here they are, because Lan Wangji loves him.</p>\n<p>\"Wei Ying?\" Lan Wangji asks softly.</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine, Lan Zhan,\" Wei Wuxian replies and leans his head on Lan Wangji's shoulder. \"I'm better than fine. I'm perfect.\"</p>"
