  "text": "<p>Witchers have no emotions, they say. Witchers cannot feel like humans can, they say; witchers have had all sentiment and caring stripped away till they\u2019re little more than beasts. That\u2019s what they say.</p>\n<p>\u2026\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt would one day like to find out who \u2018they\u2019 are. Because that\u2019s a load of codswallop and he owes \u2018them\u2019 a punch in the fucking face. Geralt may not consider himself human but he\u2019s not a fucking animal either, nor a monster like the ones he slays for too little coin ungraciously given and mistrust following him from village to village like a bad smell. Even Jaskier\u2019s songs haven\u2019t done enough to ease the wariness with which people watch him, thanks to rumours like that.</p>\n<p>Witchers <em>do</em> have feelings\u2026mostly. The Trial of the Grasses has been around for centuries and the witchers of Kaer Morhen have been tweaking it all the while. Maybe witchers of old had all their emotions stripped away, but nowadays the mutagens just dull the unhelpful ones. Sadness, loneliness, worry, doubt, anything that would get in the way of doing the job really. And the main one: fear.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since Geralt\u2019s been afraid. </p>\n<p>He catches an echo of it sometimes, like when another dozen ghouls have just burst out the ground when he\u2019s fending off five others and something sharp and unpleasant shoots through his belly before his brain has calmly adjusted to cope. It\u2019s the sour taste on his tongue whenever Yennefer does something stubborn or Jaskier does something stupid and there\u2019s a moment or two when they\u2019re in danger and Geralt isn\u2019t sure yet how to save them. It\u2019s a stirring in his head, a memory of those moments when he was left alone on a road in the woods, abandoned and afraid.</p>\n<p>But yeah, apart from those lingering echoes, which happen less and less often the longer he spends on the Path, the more experience he gets and the more confidence he has that there aren\u2019t that many things that can take him down (the exception is the situations caused by Yennefer being stubborn or Jaskier being stupid, they seem to be happening <em>more </em>frequently)\u2026apart from <em>those</em> moments, Geralt really doesn\u2019t know what being scared feels like.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, not at all?\u201d Jaskier says indignantly. Whenever he\u2019s indignant his voice is capable of skipping entire octaves. Geralt can hear a fleder preparing to attack from thirty feet away; he winces without thinking, which Jaskier seems to take as an admission of guilt. \u201cMelitele\u2019s tits, you kept that quiet didn\u2019t you! I tell you what Geralt, you\u2019re a lot less impressive all of a sudden, Mr I-Feel-No-Fear. I\u2019m sure if I had balls the size of dragon eggs I\u2019d feel fine about going up against wargs and bloodzoots and \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBloedzuigers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, them, and all of the other little beasties you waggle your sword at. Honestly! Doesn\u2019t feel fear. To think of it\u2026\u201d Jaskier subsides into outraged muttering, and Geralt seizes the moment of blessed silence to focus on the cockatrice tracks in the damp earth before them. Winter has been hard and people reach for their purses less often in the taverns, despite Jaskier\u2019s best efforts. If Geralt can kill the beast without too much of a struggle he\u2019ll be able to sell the quills and liver in the apothecary two towns over and get them both a room in a good inn, some half-decent food and, god\u2019s willing, a fucking <em>bath.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d The tracks are deep for their size, and there\u2019s a tang of iron heavy in the air. The cockatrice has been this way recently and dragging its kill, most likely one of the village\u2019s cows again. Good. If it\u2019s fat and sleepy it\u2019ll be easier to kill.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to, y\u2019know, cover your eyes or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt pauses and turns very slowly to look at his companion. Jaskier peers back at him, all big eyes and worried expression, a leather cloak wrapped tight round his head and shoulders to keep off the damp.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier. How the fuck do you think covering my eyes is a good tactic when I\u2019m about to fight something that wants to eat me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! But it\u2019s in all the myths!\u201d Jaskier\u2019s expression is so earnest that it causes a weird pain somewhere under Geralt\u2019s breastbone to look at him. \u201cA cockatrice is so full of hate and vengeance \u2013 you see Geralt, it feels more than you do \u2013 that meeting its glance can turn you to stone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Geralt has to pause again and pinch at the bridge of his nose. Jaskier means well, he really does. \u201cThat is not accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somehow that shuts Jaskier up again, and because Geralt isn\u2019t sure how long the respite will last he immediately surges forward. The scent of blood is stronger now and he tracks it easily to a rough-hewn cave in the mountainside, where the smell mingles with the sweet-sour stench of cockatrice dung.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he orders, unsheathing his sword. The cave\u2019s not huge, which means it\u2019ll be difficult for him to get behind the beast and take it out. He\u2019d rather not lose a chunk of flesh to those talons if he has to face it head on.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Geralt! I need to chronicle this epic fight \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cockatrice, it looks like a chicken fucked a lizard and smells about as bad. There\u2019s nothing epic here. Now stay back!\u201d Geralt shoves a growl in at the end in the desperate hope it might make Jaskier listen for once, and is vaguely gratified to see the bard\u2019s eyes go even wider as he swallows hard. Then Geralt is plunging headfirst into the cave, his sword held ready before him. Let\u2019s get this over with.</p>\n<p>The cockatrice turns out to be a mean-spirited motherfucker. Its talons take a chunk out of Geralt\u2019s bicep \u2013 not his sword arm, thank fuck \u2013 and even worse, screams its fury directly into his face so that he nearly chokes on the stench of half-digested cow stomach. It\u2019s petty vengeance more than anything else that spurs Geralt into slicing through its wingjoints rather than going straight for the back of the neck, and he regrets it instantly when the beast bucks him off whilst screeching in agony, and then heads for the cave exit.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier!\u201d Geralt roars, hoping desperately the bard can hear him over the beast\u2019s screaming. \u201cMove! It\u2019s coming out!\u201d He runs after it as fast as he can as the cockatrice bursts out of the cave.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake that you hideous beast!\u201d comes Jaskier\u2019s voice, and Geralt suddenly finds he\u2019s running even faster. \u201cOooooo\u2026oh dear. Geralt!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Geralt mutters under his breath, and then he\u2019s leaping from the cave mouth onto the cockatrice\u2019s back in a single move, his sword already swinging through its final arc. Jaskier is watching with huge eyes as the beast\u2019s head plummets into the soft earth between his legs, sprawled on the ground with his back against a tree trunk and nowhere else to go. If Geralt had even been a second or two later\u2026</p>\n<p>The rest of the cockatrice collapses unceremoniously to the ground with Geralt still on it and for a moment he just lies there, surrounded by stinking chicken-lizard skin and with his arm throbbing like a bitch. There\u2019s a faint drizzle landing on his face and it\u2019s going to be a good three-mile hike through the forest to get back to where they left Roach and the half-lame gelding Jaskier bought from a crooked trader because he can\u2019t tell good horseflesh from bad. And before that Geralt is going to have to pull out a dozen cockatrice quills by hand and then gruesomely disembowel the creature to get to the liver that\u2019s only going to buy him a half-decent dinner and a single night at an inn.</p>\n<p>Geralt groans and gets to his feet.</p>\n<p>And a bath. Let\u2019s focus on the bath.</p>\n<p>He gives the cockatrice a sulky kick as he rounds the side and looks down at Jaskier. There\u2019s another scent in amongst the cow\u2019s stomach and blood and shit, a sour bitterness that makes his nose wrinkle, and then he notices the patches at Jaskier\u2019s collar and under his arms and realises it\u2019s the stink of fear-sweat, heavy and thick on the tongue. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since Geralt\u2019s been afraid, but he\u2019s familiar with the emotion. All humans seem to stink of it to a greater or lesser extent, and especially when they see him, when they notice his eyes and realise he\u2019s a witcher, something that could kill them as easily as the monsters in the dark do and, according to \u2018them\u2019, with about as much compassion. The mutagens dulled Geralt\u2019s emotions but heightened his senses, and he wanders through a world that most humans couldn\u2019t conceive of, scenting their feelings as easily as he sees their faces, and fear \u2013 that acrid unpleasant taste at the back of his throat \u2013 that\u2019s the one he dislikes the most.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet up,\u201d he growls. Jaskier\u2019s scent has sparked one of those lingering echoes in his own head, and Geralt doesn\u2019t care for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d Jaskier is still staring wide-eyed at the cockatrice\u2019s head in front of him. The razor-sharp beak is less than an inch or two away from his groin. Maybe there\u2019s some justification for the fear. \u201cThat thing nearly unmanned me! Could you even imagine? Ladies would be weeping for the loss from here to Hengfors \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet up Jaskier.\u201d Geralt says, feeling very tired all of a sudden. Bath. Think about the bath. He yanks the head out of the ground and shoves it into the large leather pouch he has for carrying trophies \u2013 too often unscrupulous aldermen have tried to withhold payment on the basis he has no \u201cproof\u201d that he\u2019s taken care of their monster \u2013 and goes to roll the corpse over. The cockatrice\u2019s belly is grossly distended and Geralt is fully, wearily, aware of just how much half-digested cow he\u2019s going to have to paw through to reach the liver.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help with anything Geralt?\u201d Jaskier asks. For once his voice is soft and timid and doesn\u2019t hurt Geralt\u2019s ears. Geralt looks at him standing there, his hair curling slightly in the drizzle and his cheeks still pink from the shock, and grunts agreement. He lends Jaskier his leather gloves \u2013 no point in getting them covered in cow \u2013 to protect his hands, and shows him how to take a firm grip and yank out the quills from the root. Then he gets to work on the stomach. Jaskier makes a few gagging noises when the smell of decomposing cow reaches him, but otherwise they work in silence, and the work goes quicker with two. Geralt is covered in cockatrice bile to his elbows by the time he\u2019s fished out the small, opalescent-green liver and looks down at it, pleased. One this colour means the beast was close to its three-year mating peak, and that means not only is he glad he killed it before it could spawn but it\u2019ll also fetch twice the price.</p>\n<p>Jaskier is clomping round the clearing, shaking dirt off his leather cloak and muttering about stains. Geralt\u2019s about to say something cutting when he notices the small pile of quills beside him. They\u2019re tied neatly, and kept out of the mud by what looks like one of Jaskier\u2019s old doublets. Apothecarists insist that they\u2019re in mint condition or they won\u2019t buy. Geralt adds both items to his pouch, and hauls himself to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell this is jolly good luck!\u201d Jaskier is peering at the sky and beaming. \u201cIf we make good time getting back to the horses we could probably reach Kalisz before dark. Did I ever tell you about the time I stayed there a few years ago \u2013 this was before we met, when I was just starting out on the noble pursuit of bard \u2013 and I struck up an intimate friendship with the enchanting young daughter of the town\u2019s mayor \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMove, Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s babbling accompanies them for the first mile of the trek, and Geralt is irritated to discover that even weighed down with half a cockatrice corpse it still makes the time go faster. Jaskier is whistling some possible melodies for his new composition \u2013 <em>The White Wolf versus the Creature of Vengeance</em> \u2013 when he tips his head back to glance at Geralt with one bright blue eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean it right Geralt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMean what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I said earlier \u2013 that the cockatrice feels more than you do.\u201d Geralt doesn\u2019t say anything. Usually he chooses not to speak, but right now he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d say. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed any of that nonsense about witchers not having feelings; why, anyone who\u2019s spent as much time as I have in the company of the greatest witcher of all \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe White Wolf himself, Geralt of Rivia, why, I defy anyone who\u2019s ever met you for more than a moment to say that you don\u2019t have emotions. Granted, it\u2019s usually irritation, but that still counts.\u201d That bright blue eye is still watching him, and Geralt feels flayed alive under its gaze. \u201cNo one could do what you do without emotions! There\u2019s a reason \u2018friend of humanity\u2019 is my favourite line in the song\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll great heroes are defined by their capacity for great emotion! Compassion, loyalty, steadfastness, bravery \u2013 <em>oops!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Geralt grabs Jaskier by the back of his doublet and hauls him to safety, just before the bard strides over the edge of a cliff concealed by vines. Jaskier stumbles back against his chest with a little <em>ooph </em>and Geralt still has adrenaline pumping through his veins from the fight and his senses are on high alert, which is why he can immediately hear the rabbit-quick beat of Jaskier\u2019s heart, feel the warmth of him through their clothes and smell him \u2013 the usual scents of human male, sweat and dirt and testosterone, but then Jaskier\u2019s own aroma of warm sweet meadow-grass and fresh cider \u2013 and not a trace of fear, like he knew Geralt would catch him before he fell.</p>\n<p>Geralt holds him there for a second and then lets go once he\u2019s sure Jaskier\u2019s found his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, which is stupid of him because Jaskier should be thanking him for saving his scrawny neck from his own stupidity <em>yet again</em>, but Jaskier just blinks up at him with big blue eyes and smiles.</p>\n<p>They trek the rest of the way in more or less silence, Jaskier only singing or humming softly to himself. It\u2019s nice.</p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t know how he feels about that.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>They\u2019re in Olesnica by the time <em>The White Wolf versus the Creature of Vengeance</em> \u2013 heavily revised \u2013 makes its debut. The town\u2019s one of the larger they\u2019ve been in for a while and Geralt is remembering all the reasons he hates big towns (the smell of them being chief amongst them) as he sits in a corner of the tavern and watches Jaskier do his thing. The apothecary in Kalisz gave them a good price \u2013 probably because Geralt hadn\u2019t yet had a chance to wash off the cow blood and cockatrice bile when he plunked the spoils down on his counter \u2013 and the alderman paid up too, probably for similar reasons, so Geralt\u2019s purse ended up fat and jingling for once. But the inn in Kalisz only had a tiny tub that Geralt could barely fit into, so he\u2019s looking forward to tonight.</p>\n<p>Possibly the only thing he likes about big towns is the fact they have better inns, with better baths.</p>\n<p>And better beer.</p>\n<p>He takes another swig. Listening to Jaskier sing about him is bad enough when he\u2019s drunk, when he\u2019s sober it\u2019s nothing short of excruciating. The crowd goes quiet as Jaskier jumps onto the stage. He\u2019s wearing a new pale blue doublet that he bought for the occasion and he beams out at his audience before setting his fingers to Filavandrel\u2019s lute\u2026</p>\n<p>By the time he\u2019s done Geralt could quite happily have dissolved into drowner ooze and seeped into the river rather than listen to another word, but the crowd are applauding like crazy and Jaskier looks like he could cry from happiness. As soon as he comes off stage a dozen people line up to buy him drinks and Geralt resigns himself to a long wait before they go to their rooms, and also probably having to stop Jaskier from drowning in the tub. The crowd settles back down around him and he listens to the chatter with half an ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, these witchers are creatures as fearsome as the beasts they kill, that\u2019s for sure!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the bard was exaggerating half of it. Taking its head off with a single blow? Nonsense! Either he\u2019s making up the stories of the monster or he\u2019s making up the stories of the witcher.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell the tale of the cockatrice is right enough, my wife\u2019s sister\u2019s cousin from over down by Radomsko heard tales from a soldier who\u2019d seen one once \u2013 just as the bard described, a fierce and terrible vengeful beast, and looking just like if a chicken\u2019d fucked a lizard!\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt snorts and then has to hide his face in his tankard.</p>\n<p>\u201cAye that does sound right terrible indeed! My wife\u2019d be a week cleaning the stains out of my pants if I had to face one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike hell! I\u2019d stand and fight \u2013 if some mutant can kill one it can\u2019t be that hard!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to the little shit \u2013 you\u2019d piss your pants on the spot laddy, make no mistake about that. You\u2019ve got to be heartless as a witcher to stand up to murderous creatures like that without being unmanned by fear, gotta have all your emotions ripped away by their unnatural practices\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s got a pleasant little buzz going from the better-than-usual beer, and it\u2019s nothing more than he\u2019s heard a thousand times before, but suddenly there\u2019s a slightly-staggering Jaskier in front of him, frowning over at the men.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho makes the claim that witchers have no feelings?! I declare to you sir, stand up and face the ignominy of your words!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime for bed Jaskier.\u201d Geralt mutters, grabbing the bard by the arm. The idea of Jaskier trying to defend his honour in a bar is strangely sweet and utterly ridiculous. The men are too busy gaping at him to respond and Geralt would like to keep it that way, so when Jaskier plants his feet and tries to resist Geralt just gives him a single unimpressed look before tossing him over his shoulder and striding towards the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot a thing for witchers has he?\u201d He hears behind him as they go, and then:</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta be pretty bloody brave to befriend one of those unnatural devils, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier is running up and down octaves in drunken outrage by the time Geralt kicks the door to their rooms open and breathes out a sigh of relief at the sight of the huge steaming tub by the side of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier. I\u2019m having a bath. You can keep talking, but I\u2019m no longer listening.\u201d He puts the bard right way up, waits to make sure he\u2019s not going to fall straight back down, and then starts stripping single-mindedly. Jaskier has sulkily made his way to one of the beds and has propped his chin on his fist, gazing soulfully at the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust wait\u2026my next\u2026my next song will be in the style of an Aedirn ballad \u2013 I haven\u2019t composed an Aedirn ballad in years Geralt, did you\u2026did you know that, what a tragic waste of my anxiety\u2026wait\u2026my enmity\u2026wait\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbility.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! My ability, a tragic waste\u2026a ballad! It will be a ballad, all about the noble heart of a witcher! Full of\u2026of\u2026compassion! Nobility! Resoluteness! Nobility!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any of those things. And you said nobility twice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes...yes, you do.\u201d Jaskier blinks at him confusedly from where he\u2019s still sitting on the bed, his chin occasionally slipping off his own fist. Geralt watches him from the tub. He\u2019s far more indulgent of Jaskier\u2019s drunken ramblings when his muscles are slowly unknotting in the warm water. Most humans do not appear at their best when they\u2019ve been drinking \u2013 blotchy red faces, and stale alcohol starting to sweat out of their pores \u2013 but Jaskier is just a bit messy and rumpled, two spots of red high on his cheekbones that make his eyes look even bluer, and still smelling sweetly of meadow-grass. Geralt realises with a sigh that it\u2019s his bed that Jaskier\u2019s sitting on, which means he\u2019ll be smelling it all night, and beckons him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier. The tub\u2019s big enough for two. Get in before the water goes cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other good thing about Jaskier being drunk is that it makes him curiously obedient. Geralt shifts his gaze back to the water as Jaskier fumbles his way out of his clothes and then slides into the tub, hissing at the hot water. It seems to push him into the next stage of drunkenness, sends him loose-limbed and slurring as he leans back against the side of the tub beside Geralt. It\u2019s<em> just </em>big enough for them both.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou always have it so hot witcher. Why is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKaer Morhen is in the mountains.\u201d The words are out before Geralt is aware he\u2019s saying them. \u201cIt\u2019s always cold there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jaskier tilts his head over to look at him, sleepily blinking blue eyes. Geralt shifts a little closer so he can fish the other man out if he sinks under. \u201cYou should have come up earlier then, it would have been even hotter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt just stares at him. For once, Jaskier is\u2026completely right. Geralt has no earthly idea why the hell he stayed downstairs once Jaskier finished performing, instead of coming up to enjoy the water when it would have been too blisteringly hot for a human to stand, just the way he likes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026I had to keep an eye on you, didn\u2019t I. You\u2019re guaranteed to get into trouble if there\u2019s alcohol and women around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs and tips over. His head ends up on Geralt\u2019s shoulder. His hair is starting to curl a little in the steam.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy bodyguard! At least you didn\u2019t tell anyone I was a eunuch this time\u2026though with you sitting in the corner scowling I\u2019m sure you scared off all the ladies anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt snorts. Even his presence couldn\u2019t dampen the ladies appreciation for Jaskier\u2019s voice, or his looks \u2013 Geralt could smell it even halfway across the room, even though the beginning of the sour-fear notes of the men around him as they talked about facing down a cockatrice.</p>\n<p>Geralt blinks, and blinks again. He looks down at the head on his shoulder, and nudges it when Jaskier seems entranced in watching his fingers waggle beneath the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, Geralt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf\u2026the ladies? Geralt! Surely you know that a man of my reputation and, well, <em>prowess</em> \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the ladies.\u201d Geralt interrupts impatiently. He\u2019s heard quite enough stories of Jaskier\u2019s <em>prowess. </em>\u201cThe cockatrice. Weren\u2019t you afraid to face it? You thought it could turn you to stone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to keep bringing that up Geralt.\u201d Jaskier says primly. \u201cIt was an unfortunate unsubstantiated source, that\u2019s all, my knowledge of beasts and necrophages has vastly improved over the course of our acquaintance as you know \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cJaskier.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Oh \u2013 afraid? Um, yes, I suppose. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you come then?\u201d Geralt is genuinely confused. Jaskier is no better equipped to meet a cockatrice head on than any of the men downstairs \u2013 less so, in fact, at least they have the strength that comes from ploughing and farming when Jaskier has never wielded anything heavier than his lute. And humans tend not to do things when they\u2019re afraid. Oh, the stories tell of bravery and feats of valour and all that horseshit, but Geralt can always smell the truth. There\u2019s no scent that marks acts of cowardice, selfishness, weakness, but they\u2019re nearly all always preceded by that same sour tang: fear brings out the very worst of humanity.</p>\n<p>So why the hell does Jaskier feel afraid, and then do the exact opposite of everyone else?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did I come even though I was afraid?\u201d Jaskier is looking up at him with the same equally baffled expression that Geralt is sure is on his own face. \u201cBecause you were there of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>That is\u2026no one has ever\u2026</p>\n<p>Humans smell of fear when they see him, when they notice his eyes and realise he\u2019s a witcher and could kill them as easily as the thousand other things they\u2019re scared of. Geralt has never met someone who not only has <em>never once </em>smelt of fear when they saw him, but who is <em>less</em> afraid because of him, who feels safer in his presence than out of it. Even Yennefer, as much as he feels for her and as powerful as she is, she always feels some frisson of unease around him, some tendril of alarm at what he is and what he could do.</p>\n<p>But not Jaskier. Not this bard who adopts Geralt\u2019s cause as his own, who safeguards his reputation and chronicles his deeds \u2013 who stands true at his side even if that means swallowing down his own fears to do so.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since Geralt was afraid, which means it\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s been truly brave. Bravery does have a scent, a scent like woodash and iron and leather, like resolve and integrity given physical form.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of the scents Geralt likes most.</p>\n<p>He jerks out of his thoughts at a rumbling sound, and makes a desperate grab for Jaskier before the snoring bard sinks beneath the water. Then Geralt just sits there and looks down at the other man helplessly. Jaskier is limp in his hands, his skin all soft and warm, his blue eyes closed as he makes little snuffling noises, so completely trusting and vulnerable in Geralt\u2019s arms that he feels that weird stab in his belly again that\u2019s the closest he gets to terror.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck am I supposed to do now?\u201d He asks the room and the tubful of cooling water and the snoring Jaskier.</p>\n<p>None of them give him a satisfactory answer.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Geralt is\u2026being weird. Well. Weird-er. The witcher usually operates at a fairly high level of peculiarity anyway but in the last few weeks this seems to have kicked up a notch into outright\u2026oddness. Jaskier taps his quill against his lips and ponders on the evidence he has collected to support his theory. As any of the numerous villainous creatures they have dispatched together (well, Geralt did most of the dispatching, but Jaskier\u2019s contributions were of equal importance) <em>anyway,</em> as any of those foul beasts can attest, when going into battle with a witcher it is critical to be fully prepared and well-armed. Not that Jaskier considers the upcoming conversation he hopes to have with Geralt as a <em>battle, </em>but, well, his friend\u2019s already notorious testiness seems even more in evidence recently and\u2026</p>\n<p>Well! In short, Jaskier is worried about Geralt and thinks the best solution would be to have a good heart-to-heart, man-to-man, close-friend-to-close-friend chat about it. And considering Geralt has<em> literally</em> jumped into a catacomb before to avoid talking about his emotions, Jaskier is going to have to have all his ducks in a line \u2013 hmmmm, duck, it\u2019s been an age since he\u2019s had roast duck \u2013 to browbeat the Witcher into openness and candour, and presenting a thoroughly robust litany of evidence will be part of that.</p>\n<p>Like right now. Like right this very instant, when Geralt has paused in sharpening his sword \u2013 Geralt<em> never</em> interrupts his sword cleaning routine \u2013 and is staring fixedly at the end of Jaskier\u2019s quill. Jaskier peeks at him from under his lashes and taps the quill against his mouth a few times just to watch the witcher\u2019s eyes follow the motion. Yes, definitely staring. This is number four on Jaskier\u2019s list of evidence of Geralt being weird-er than usual \u2013 Geralt\u2019s recent unusual fascination with the tools of Jaskier\u2019s trade. He\u2019s constantly watching Jaskier\u2019s quill or his lute when Jaskier is writing or playing. Is Geralt perhaps considering a change in profession? Jaskier has never so much as heard him hum but Geralt has a lovely rolling baritone \u2013 that some would call a growl, but never him, sir, never! \u2013 and Jaskier is sure he\u2019d have a very nice singing voice. And he\u2019s equally sure that no one would ever stint on their coin in a tavern if Geralt was the one performing, that intimidating glare at the end of each performance would loosen purse strings admirably.</p>\n<p>Number three on Jaskier\u2019s list is actually so much of a boon that he\u2019s hesitant to bring it to his companion\u2019s attention less conscious awareness should result in its retraction\u2026basically, Geralt hasn\u2019t been complaining about Jaskier coming along on hunts. Sometimes he even lets Jaskier help! Not with the actual chopping and cutting of the beast in question of course, that is still Geralt\u2019s unquestionable area of expertise and Jaskier even rather likes watching him work, all that grace and power and strength in motion\u2026but he points out things as they track the creatures to their lair, tracks or markings or whatnot, and lets Jaskier help with collecting the spoils afterwards, which, yes, is often absolutely disgusting work, but!</p>\n<p>The level of realism it brings to Jaskier\u2019s work is unparalleled. And all great artists must suffer for their craft, so Jaskier bears it nobly. And he doesn\u2019t complain nearly as much as Geralt says he does, so there.</p>\n<p>Number two on Jaskier\u2019s list is, well\u2026and yes Jaskier is well aware that he sounds like an utter cad for indicating he is in anyway ungrateful for such attentions but\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt keeps asking him how he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>Which is really, really fucking weird.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, Geralt developing a sudden and deep-seated interest into Jaskier\u2019s wellbeing would be unequivocally, without question, number one on the list. Frankly, the first time Geralt asked him if he was okay Jaskier nearly fell of his horse \u2013 and no, not because poor Algernon is lame, shut up about that Geralt \u2013 and almost called an intervention on the spot. That\u2019s not because he thinks Geralt doesn\u2019t<em> care </em>about his feelings, he is almost absolutely sure that his very close friend does, it\u2019s just\u2026Geralt doesn\u2019t normally <em>vocalise</em> such things. Out loud. Where other people could hear them. And mistake them for friends.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s testimony to the extent of Jaskier\u2019s discomfort with number one on the list that it trumps that truly epic manifestation of complete and utter bizarreness. Number one on the list is so befuddling, so disquieting, so, so\u2026</p>\n<p>Look, it\u2019s like this: Geralt won\u2019t stop sniffing him.</p>\n<p>Now, Jaskier might not be as obsessed with bathing as a certain white-haired witcher wearing black armour and a wolf medallion who will remain nameless \u2013 and really, Jaskier half believes Geralt only likes baths so much because he enjoys striding around naked afterwards, all six foot of muscle and masculinity enough to set any poor bard\u2019s jaw to dropping \u2013 but Jaskier is clean! He bathes! What he means to say is \u2013 he is reasonably sure he does not smell bad. A number of ladies have commented on his pleasant natural odour in fact.</p>\n<p>So Geralt and his sniffy-sniff-sniffing all the time can just fuck off.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d The word comes out sharper than he intended, startling them both. Geralt even looks slightly surprised, which is an expression Jaskier never thought he\u2019d see on the witcher\u2019s face, amber eyes blinking once, and then \u2013</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s nostrils flare wide and that barrel chest of his expands as he takes a deep breath in.</p>\n<p>Jaskier literally wants to scream.</p>\n<p>Geralt is his friend, yes, one of his closest friends, indeed, his best friend ever, yes it is entirely possible you could say that and Jaskier feels like he\u2019s going out of his mind because he\u2019s not <em>stupid</em>, he knows Geralt tolerates him with wry amusement at best and three lyrics away from a lynching at worst but, but\u2026</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not Jaskier\u2019s fault he has a romantic soul okay? He was raised on tales of truth and justice, gallantry and heroism, and then he got out into the real world and discovered it\u2019s a threadbare tapestry of human mistrust and selfishness and petty grievances piling on top of one another till they sour the soul. And then he met Geralt, who\u2019s a <em>witcher </em>for mercy\u2019s sake, his kind are usually the <em>villains</em> in the tales, but who is honest to a fault and brutally fair and yes, he is gallant and heroic even if he\u2019d deny those things with his dying breath but he is the closest thing Jaskier has found to a warrior of legend on the whole dingy continent!</p>\n<p>And if Jaskier has resigned himself to never quite measuring up against his friend, well, that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s sort of the whole point of a muse really \u2013 they should represent an impossible-to-achieve golden ideal. Jaskier is used to the idea that Geralt is out of reach. But Geralt suddenly undergoing a whole personality shift, suddenly seeming so much more present, more mortal, more like he wants to make a space for Jaskier in his life\u2026</p>\n<p>That\u2019s really not something Jaskier\u2019s heart can take.</p>\n<p>Also, he really is just quite concerned about the sniffing thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Geralt asks, and his voice is low and careful in a way that Jaskier has never heard before and can\u2019t quite bear to hear now.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he says, and storms out of the room before Geralt can be any nicer and makes things worse.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Gods why are humans so fucking contrary?</p>\n<p>A couple of townsfolk scatter out the way as Geralt strides across the square. He\u2019s got no fucking clue why they\u2019re even outside considering the rain is coming down like it wants to drown the world. They should scurry back to their houses and Geralt can go back to his inn and drown <em>himself</em> in ale and try to forget that the last three days of this hunt ever happened.</p>\n<p>Geralt hates rain like this. It muffles everything, sound and smell, like he may as well have lost both senses completely for all the good they do him.</p>\n<p>Stepping inside the inn is like having a veil lifted. There\u2019s still the distant drumming of the rain outside, and the scent of damp mud and horseshit rising off the floorboards, but it\u2019s still a thousand times better than any moment in the last seventy-two hours has been. Geralt even almost welcomes the fear-stink coming off the innkeeper's daughter -\u2013he vaguely tries to rearrange his face so it looks less like a thundercloud, but there\u2019s nothing he can do about the eyes, or the hair, or, well, just him in general. She manages to stutter out that his bath is ready in his room and Geralt could kiss her, but doesn\u2019t, because they\u2019d probably try to stone him out of the town and he wants to get dry first.</p>\n<p>Then he steps through the doorway and sees Jaskier sitting next to the steaming tub, and thinks maybe a stoning wouldn\u2019t be too bad.</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t seen the bard since he stormed out of here a week ago. Geralt sat around like an alp-struck idiot twiddling his thumbs for four days \u2013 three and a half days longer than he\u2019d ever spent in a town like this \u2013 before he took a quest for a drowner just to stop himself going out of his mind with frustration. Not that three days wading through a swamp with the sky itself trying to beat him to death has done anything to improve his mood.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d The words come out a growl. He can\u2019t help it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt!\u201d Jaskier jumps to his feet. The bard looks tired. Geralt tries to take a breath to scent him, and gets nothing but the swamp-water coming off his own clothes. Jaskier\u2019s eye twitches oddly, but then he\u2019s pointing to the tub. \u201cGet in then you great lummox. Melitele\u2019s perfumed thighs, I suppose this is more of your fancy \u2018mutagens\u2019, giving you the ability to breathe underwater.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe underwater.\u201d Geralt says. Fuck. He\u2019d once thought a week without Jaskier\u2019s babble would have been the closest thing to bliss he could experience, but now he can feel the tension in his muscles unwinding before he\u2019s even gotten in the bath, just from the way the other man arches an eyebrow and lifts up a strand of Geralt\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? Because it looks like you tried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrowner. Big one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jaskier doesn\u2019t say anything else, just prods Geralt into the tub and then tips a bucket of water over his head that he\u2019s been keeping by the fire. It\u2019s so hot Geralt can\u2019t help the moan when it hits him. Jaskier makes a strange sound himself and drops the bucket, and then has to chase it round the tub a couple of times before he manages to pick it up. \u201cWell, there we go, a nice cosy witcher, I\u2019ll just go and fetch us some \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier. Sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s still clutching the bucket to his chest as he edges back onto the stool beside the tub, looking like a deer that\u2019s come face-to-face with a wolf in the forest. He\u2019s wearing the pale blue doublet again and his chin is lightly stubbled, like he\u2019s been careless about shaving the past few days. Geralt eyes him sideways, trying to get a sense of his thoughts. Even wary like this, Jaskier still doesn\u2019t smell of fear \u2013 why would he, he feels <em>safer</em> around Geralt, and fuck's sake Geralt can hear the smugness about that even inside his own head \u2013 but there\u2019s other little scents there, hidden tells, and Geralt takes a breath to test them \u2013</p>\n<p>- and promptly takes a bucket to the face as Jaskier flings it at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop sniffing me goddamn you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt had enough reflexes to duck the bucket but not to dodge it completely, and winces as it bounces off his skull. Then he\u2019s lunging to grab a handful of that pale blue doublet as Jaskier makes another dash for the door.</p>\n<p>Geralt has had decades to get used to witcher strength, to adjust to the power of his muscles and learn precisely how much force is needed at any one moment.</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s very glad that Vesemir isn\u2019t here to see him yank Jaskier back so hard the bard comes flying over the edge of the tub, sending them both sprawling as water splashes up and onto the floor. For a long moment the two of them just sit there in the half-full tub, Geralt increasingly aware of the fact that he\u2019s stark naked and Jaskier is a heavy warm weight across his lap, and also that Jaskier\u2019s scent is spiking with so many things it\u2019s hard to keep track of. Then Jaskier\u2019s words catch up with the rest of his brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re angry with me? Because I scent you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScent me? <em>Scent </em>me? Geralt, my friend, I\u2019m aware that the finer nuances of human social conventions tend to pass you by \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes or no answers Jaskier. Is that why you\u2019re mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Mostly. Partly. So, well, it is a part of the whole, an aspect of a wider disgruntlement if you will \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>God it\u2019s good to hear him talk. Geralt sighs and drops his head to Jaskier\u2019s shoulder and just exists there for a long moment, letting the words wash over him. Then there\u2019s a sharp sensation in his arm as Jaskier pokes him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Geralt? Geralt, have you \u2013 nope, not asleep, gods there\u2019s no need to glare at me like that. Yes, okay, your weird sniffing thing is\u2026is\u2026throwing me off, okay, you just started doing it out of nowhere and I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier stares at him. Geralt raises an eyebrow and stares back. It\u2019s not that hard a concept to grasp is it? Even humans can smell each other, they have to be familiar with the idea. And whilst it\u2019s true, Jaskier does smell nice, it\u2019s more that he\u2019s the only person that Geralt\u2019s ever been around who doesn\u2019t smell of fear. It\u2019s like living in a town that smells of shit your whole life and then going to live in a meadow full of spring flowers. Why would you ever want to leave?</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt. Do you want to become a bard?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s brain actually hurts a little bit. What \u2013 how \u2013 he honestly can\u2019t keep up with the inside of Jaskier\u2019s head sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. What the fuck Jaskier? What sort of question is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to ask!\u201d Jaskier says. He\u2019s twisting round to face Geralt, seemingly completely oblivious to where he\u2019s sitting and what he\u2019s sitting on, and waving his hands wildly for emphasis. \u201cObviously I would fully support you if that was your wish \u2013 very noble of me though, if I do say so myself, offering to take a potential competitor under my wing \u2013 and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be remarkably competent once we\u2019d taught you to play and got you an outfit that complimented your physique \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cJaskier. </em>I do not want to be a bard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Okay then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt takes a breath. He\u2019s going to regret this.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2026what would make you ask that question?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s not just the sniffing thing that has been a cause of discombobulation recently, though that ranks very highly on a list of concerning behaviours Geralt, I really can\u2019t stress enough \u2013 okay, okay, it\u2019s because you keep staring at me! Whenever I\u2019m composing or playing that is, and I thought maybe you were becoming interested in the craft and I thought I should offer to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been staring at Jaskier? Geralt flicks his mind back to recent weeks. He knows that his focus has shifted more fully onto Jaskier, trying to puzzle out the secret to the other man\u2019s bravery, trying to puzzle him out at all, in all honesty. And \u2013 the importance of Jaskier has shifted, somewhere inside his head and his gut, inside the bit of him that\u2019s pure instinct and feeling, the bit that Geralt\u2019s never been sure if the mutagens made it or if it\u2019s the most human part of him. He wants Jaskier near him, wants to keep Jaskier safe and well, wants\u2026wants other things that are going to become more apparent if Jaskier doesn\u2019t get off his lap sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>He shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good to look at.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier looks at him. His doublet is damp and clinging to his skin and his eyes are very blue and even if Geralt weren\u2019t a witcher Jaskier is still alone in a room with a naked man twice his size and three times his strength and Geralt understands that\u2019s a thing that gives most humans pause and yet Jaskier still, <em>still,</em> doesn\u2019t smell of fear in the slightest.</p>\n<p>It feels like a gift he\u2019s giving to Geralt, his fearlessness. Woodash and iron and leather.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt. Geralt, we have been friends \u2013 yes I\u2019m insisting upon friends, hear me out \u2013 we have been friends for some time now, and so I\u2019m going to beg for your tolerance whilst I air a thought, a musing, that is passing through my brain, which, if it gives you any cause for distress or anger I urge you not to take it out on me in the slightest \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpit it out Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt. If a woman told me I smell nice and look nice I\u2019d assume I was spending the evening in her bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at Geralt. Geralt looks back. He thought he\u2019d made his intentions fairly clear but if that\u2019s not something Jaskier is interested in \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cMelitele save me from idiot witchers!\u201d Jaskier cries, and then grabs Geralt\u2019s head to pull him down into a kiss.</p>\n<p>Jaskier smells good but he tastes even better and Geralt can\u2019t help the growl as he manhandles the bard into a better position on his lap, shoving his tongue inside Jaskier\u2019s mouth. Even with Geralt forcefully kissing him the bard can\u2019t stop making noise, but the little whimpers and moans don\u2019t grate on Geralt\u2019s ears at all but stoke the fire in his belly even higher. Fuck, he wants to force even more of those noises out of Jaskier, have them match the hot butter smell of lust coming off the other man\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>Geralt gets a firm grip on Jaskier\u2019s thighs and lifts him out of the tub, Jaskier making a squeaking noise when Geralt throws him down on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll say, those mutagens are good for some\u2026thing\u2026\u201d he trails off, staring at Geralt\u2019s groin. Geralt looks down at his hard cock, and back at Jaskier\u2019s face. Still no fear. Thank fuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026Geralt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming when you have those women in your bed you do more than just stare at them like a poleaxed cow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier gives him a deeply, deeply offended look, which is mostly mitigated by the fact that he\u2019s pulling off his doublet as fast as he can. Geralt helps with the trousers. Jaskier is babbling something about ladies and satisfaction and <em>prowess</em> and Geralt only listens with half an ear, running his hands over Jaskier\u2019s soft skin, lightly covered in pale brown hair. The bard is slender and toned, his nipples small and tight and his cock a good handful, curving up towards his belly already, and Geralt wants to eat him alive. He shoves his thigh between Jaskier\u2019s legs and leans over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt! Please tell me you\u2019ve taken a man to bed before? Especially with <em>that.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Have you?\u201d Geralt narrows his eyes at the answer. On the one hand, it would be extremely convenient if Jaskier has experience with the proceedings, on the other hand, Geralt will gut any man who thinks to touch all this soft pale skin that belongs to Geralt now. Jaskier bites at his lip as Geralt tweaks a nipple and it takes him a moment to get the words out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI confess to a dalliance, a time or two \u2013 ah \u2013 in my youth! Many, many, years ago \u2013<em> fuck, </em>Geralt\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all that Geralt is interested in hearing about past lovers, all that he can bear to hear when he has Jaskier naked and hard and pleading beneath him, and the next few minutes pass in a blur as he stretches out on top of the other man, rubbing down hard against all that soft skin, holding Jaskier\u2019s thigh open for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMercy\u2019s sake Geralt, are you going to tease me to an early grave or do you intend to fuck me sometime in the evening\u2019s activities?\u201d</p>\n<p>If Geralt was hard before, Jaskier\u2019s words make his cock give a jerk and his balls ache. He\u2019s learnt not to assume that\u2019s on the cards with every partner, some of them taking one look and refusing to let him near them, but Jaskier\u2019s hand is closing round his cock, lute calluses rubbing him in all the right ways, and the lust-smell rising even stronger off the bard\u2019s skin as he looks down at his fingers only just closing round the girth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you oil?\u201d Geralt manages to growl out, and then swallows hard when Jaskier lunges for his bags and Geralt is treated to a perfect view of his arse, a sweet double-handful of pale skin that goes pink when Geralt closes his teeth on a cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw! Fuck, I should have known you\u2019d be the sort \u2013 here, take it, try not to gnaw off any other bits of me on your way down.\u201d Jaskier grumbles, and Geralt raises an eyebrow at the presumption but then Jaskier gives him a sunny smile, blue eyes bright and happy, and suddenly all Geralt wants to do is suck his cock for him.</p>\n<p>The <em>noises</em> Jaskier makes should be illegal, and probably are in Redania, but they just make Geralt hotter and more desperate. He\u2019s holding on to his willpower by a thread as his fingers roughly spread Jaskier open, feeling the too-tight press around him as the oil eases the way and almost humping the bedcovers in anticipation of how good it\u2019s going to feel around his cock. The rest of his brain is being driven into a blissful lustful state, Jaskier\u2019s cock hard and heavy in his mouth and the scent of him all around, feeling his fingers clutch desperately at Geralt\u2019s hair as he holds his hips down and refuses to let him move.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt, please, <em>please,</em> I need you in me, fuck, please \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d Geralt groans, moving up to bury his face in Jaskier\u2019s neck and breathe him in. God he\u2019s never smelt anything like it. He\u2019s so hard his balls are aching. \u201cYou smell so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck your freaky witcher senses and<em> fuck me</em>.\u201d Jaskier snaps, wrapping his thighs around Geralt\u2019s hips and Geralt does growl at that, reaching down to take himself in hand and press against Jaskier\u2019s entrance. The first push makes them both freeze, Jaskier heaving in startled breaths \u2013 blue eyes wide, cheekbones stained with two spots of pink, his hair curling from sweat and Geralt wants to fuck him till he screams \u2013 and slowly he begins to push forward, sliding in whilst Jaskier whimpers and wriggles like he\u2019s being split in two until his hips press against the bard\u2019s arse and they\u2019re both shivering from the feel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need\u2026a moment\u2026\u201d Jaskier manages to grit out. Geralt can feel those soft walls fluttering around him, the minute shifts of Jaskier\u2019s hips as he adjusts and to be perfectly honest he\u2019s grateful for the pause, because the combination of both with Jaskier\u2019s scent rising all around them has him three moments away from coming himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cMove.\u201d Jaskier finally whispers, and Geralt does.</p>\n<p>Jaskier is hot and tight and wet and each thrust is perfection, Geralt pushing his thighs up so he can hammer home every time. And even better than the sight, than the feel, than the <em>smell </em>of him, is the absolute litany of filth that pours from Jaskier\u2019s mouth as Geralt fucks him ruthlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, fuck, Geralt, harder \u2013 yes, <em>yes, </em>fuck, that\u2019s so good \u2013 fuck you\u2019re huge inside me, am I tight for you? \u2013 <em>ah!</em> \u2013 fuck, I\u2019ll take that as a yes, gods above, Geralt \u2013 fuck, you\u2019re splitting me in half \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cJaskier.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGods, fucking pound me, I love how strong you are \u2013 fuck, I love your huge fucking cock \u2013 ah, ah, fuck, fuck \u2013 you\u2019re so deep \u2013 you\u2019re so deep \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s cock is hard as steel as he pulls out, ignoring Jaskier\u2019s desperate whine as he flips the bard over and yanks his hips into the air. Jaskier is panting into the bedcovers as Geralt takes a firm grip on his hips and rubs his cock over Jaskier\u2019s hole, already pink and sore from Geralt\u2019s pounding.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he orders, and Jaskier\u2019s arms brace on the headboard as Geralt shoves back inside.</p>\n<p>Fuck. Yes. This is even better. For a moment he misses Jaskier\u2019s words but the bard is just <em>gasping, </em>desperate choked-off little keening noises as Geralt fucks him ruthlessly, yanking his hips back with every thrust to make sure he feels it. Jaskier is like a vice around him, clinging tightly to Geralt\u2019s cock every time he slides inside and it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to press his thumbs into the dimples at the base of Jaskier\u2019s spine, tilt his hips a little more to Geralt\u2019s liking, and then slam rapidly against the little bump inside whilst Jaskier scrambles at the sheets in desperation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh \u2013 ah \u2013 ah \u2013 fuck \u2013 fuck \u2013 Geralt, <em>please!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s too good, Geralt\u2019s wanted him for too long and now he has him and he\u2019s <em>keeping</em> him and they\u2019re going to do this whenever Geralt wants, and it\u2019s that thought that has him gritting his teeth as he jerks Jaskier\u2019s cock roughly until the bard bucks and wails and comes fucking everywhere. His knees give out and Geralt stays pressed deep to follow him down to the bed, where he ruts against the soft press of Jaskier\u2019s arse whilst the bard gasps helplessly from overstimulation.</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier,\u201d he groans, the sound coming from somewhere deep within his chest. He\u2019s got one hand clamped so tight on Jaskier\u2019s hip there\u2019ll be bruises on pale skin tomorrow, but the other gropes upwards until it finds Jaskier\u2019s, loose and trembling in the sheets, and grips it tight whilst his hips start jerking.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Geralt\u2026come on me, I want to smell like you.\u201d Jaskier says, and Geralt\u2019s vision goes white with a bolt of lust so fucking intense he can feel it in his <em>bones, </em>and he jerks out just in time to watch his come spatter across Jaskier\u2019s arse and back, thick streaks of white smeared into the skin.</p>\n<p>The last tiny ounce of Geralt\u2019s strength goes into making sure that when he collapses, it isn\u2019t directly onto Jaskier but to one side, and then they lie there for some time, each trying to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>Finally Jaskier stirs a little. He looks so good fucked out and messy that Geralt almost wants to jerk himself hard and go again straight away. \u201cThank Melitele for idiot witchers.\u201d The bard mutters, stretching on the bed. Some of Geralt\u2019s come slides off his back onto the sheets. Geralt feels his cock twitch. \u201cWell, then, witcher, that was the start of all this nonsense \u2013 what do I smell like now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike sex. Like me. Like home.\u201d Geralt says, before his brain has properly caught up with the words. That\u2019s becoming an irritating habit of his around Jaskier. Although it might be worth it for the way the other man is staring at him, blue eyes wide but his lips already curving in a smile. Jaskier leans over for a kiss, pauses slightly, and Geralt immediately meets him half-way before the sharp lemon scent of doubt can grow any stronger. Then the bard pulls away with a snort.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this, Geralt, is it some bizarre witcher custom to court someone by, what, letting them cut up a wyvern corpse with you? I\u2019d have much preferred some flowers and a romantic candlelit dinner thank you very much \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bought you dinner.\u201d Geralt protests. He didn\u2019t want to think too much about the word \u2018court\u2019. If Jaskier tried to offer him a rose and write him a love poem he\u2019d probably drop the bard in a swamp, with or without drowners depending on how bad the poem was.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you did. And several baths.\u201d Jaskier says, tapping a finger against his lips thoughtfully. Geralt really wishes Jaskier didn\u2019t draw attention to his mouth so much the whole time. Jaskier has very graceful hands and a very pretty mouth and Geralt has spent a lot of time daydreaming about what they\u2019d feel like wrapped around his \u2013 \u201cGeralt! Geralt, are you listening to me? Gods, men are bores aren\u2019t they, once they\u2019ve got what they want they just lose all interest in you \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t lose interest in you.\u201d Geralt says firmly, and doesn\u2019t wait for Jaskier\u2019s response before he rises to dip a spare cloth in the cooling bathwater and bring it back to clean Jaskier off with \u2013 the whole room smells of the two of them now, of how Geralt claimed him, so he doesn\u2019t mind too much washing off the immediate evidence. Jaskier watches him with bright blue eyes as though he knows exactly what Geralt is thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, my bed is properly fucked now, so I guess I\u2019m going to be sharing with you. If you snore or steal the covers I reserve the right to elbow you in the ribs, do you hear me witcher? I\u2019m not like other common folk, to be intimidated by your scary eyes and whatnot.\u201d Jaskier waves a hand at Geralt\u2019s\u2026well, at Geralt\u2019s everything, which Geralt feels is a little insulting, considering he\u2019s still naked and slightly hard and he understands his appearance in this regard isn\u2019t too displeasing to a lover. But more importantly is that Jaskier has no idea how true his words are, how much it matters to Geralt that he\u2019s never once been intimidated by any aspect of him at all.</p>\n<p>Geralt will spend the night curled around Jaskier on a rickety old inn bed and he will never smell of anything except sweet meadow-grass and fresh cider.</p>\n<p>They rearrange themselves on the other bed. Geralt runs hot anyway so its no hardship to bequeath most of the covers to Jaskier, and this way Geralt gets to keep the bard sprawled on top of him under the pretence of sharing. For a brief moment he considers actually having a conversation about witcher courting customs (not that there are many of them, but there\u2019s a couple of relevant bits, mainly their tendency towards <em>extreme</em> possessiveness) but he\u2019s talked too much this evening already and anyway Jaskier is stupid but he\u2019s also smart, he\u2019ll figure it out.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnding up in your bed is a much more agreeable end to the evening than the one I had anticipated.\u201d Jaskier says with a yawn, his head resting on Geralt\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou should tell me I smell nice and look nice more often if this is the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d Geralt replies. He feels more than sees Jaskier squint up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I should have expected that response! You know what they say about witchers\u2026\u201d Jaskier says, his fingers tracing shapes over Geralt\u2019s chest with teasing intent, but Geralt suddenly finds his muscles are tensing without conscious thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do \u2018they\u2019 say?\u201d He asks, that old irritation surging beneath his breastbone again, tinged with the beginnings of regret that Jaskier also\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cThat they fuck like a horse with the stamina of a bull.\u201d Jaskier says cheerfully, so obviously making it up on the spot that Geralt can\u2019t help the snort of amusement and the sudden release of all that tension. Jaskier props his chin on Geralt\u2019s chest and raises an eyebrow at him that can only be described as saucy. \u201cMost of the myths don\u2019t mention they\u2019re hung like one too though.\u201d His hand slips around Geralt\u2019s cock, soft whisper-touches that rouse him more quickly than he would have thought possible.</p>\n<p>Or maybe that\u2019s just Jaskier. His brave, foolish, irrepressible bard. His.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should worry about what \u2018they\u2019 say.\u201d Geralt says firmly, sliding an arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist, over all that soft skin he fully intends to mark up another few times tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, that\u2019s true, as an artist it\u2019s so important to get one\u2019s own impression of these things, to really grasp the concepts on an elemental level \u2013 Geralt!\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt rolls them over and hushes Jaskier\u2019s mouth with his own.</p>\n<p>Blessed silence. For a while at least.</p>"
