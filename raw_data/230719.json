  "text": "<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t <i>hiding</i> it from you. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know for certain until yesterday, which I think we can agree was bad timing and not the sort of thing one springs before the heat of battle,\u201d Charles says earnestly.</p>\n<p>Erik evidently does not agree, judging from the twitch of his jaw and the rattle of everything metal in the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrior to that, I was actually slightly concerned that I was experiencing side effects from Cerebro, or perhaps had a tapeworm,\u201d Charles continues. \u201cI could feel it, you see, and it wasn\u2019t as if I had all the data, so perhaps you can forgive me for jumping to some less exotic explanations, although genetically speaking--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can feel it?\u201d Erik says hoarsely.</p>\n<p>Charles rests one hand on his stomach. \u201cNot -- not physically,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy god,\u201d Erik says, and looks like he is genuinely in danger of vomiting, which is completely ridiculous, because if anyone has the right to vomit, it\u2019s Charles. He tries to remember if his mother ever told him anything about morning sickness during about her pregnancy. It might shed some light on what he\u2019s in for, but since this would actually have required his mother to <i>talk</i> to him, he comes up empty-handed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt any rate, Hank thinks I\u2019m about two and a half months along, so I don\u2019t imagine I\u2019ll be feeling the baby move for a while yet,\u201d Charles says, although he\u2019s mostly bullshitting because he read exactly one book on gestation, which was enough for him to tell Raven that she probably didn\u2019t want any part of that until she was at least thirty, or perhaps never.</p>\n<p>Erik had taken off that terrible helmet on the beach when Charles had given him one extremely good reason not to kill a lot of people, but Charles resisted the urge to peek to see what specifically was underneath Erik\u2019s anger and confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ve been able to--\u201d Erik trails off.</p>\n<p>Charles coughs. \u201cWell, although our immediate evidence seems to suggest that many mutations manifest at puberty, others are clearly present at birth -- Raven, for example.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s never come up before?\u201d Erik asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, of course it hasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not like I -- that is, you know I was a--\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik knows precisely, and the self-satisfied quirk to his lips is simultaneously stupidly attractive and intensely aggravating.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point is,\u201d Charles says, enunciating, \u201cyou got me into this. You\u2019d better take some responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p>He expects an argument -- he expects Erik to lash out with bitter cold words, to act out of the same fear that has driven Erik for more than a decade, a fear not extinguished with Shaw\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>But instead Erik pulls him close, hands shaking where they clasp him, terribly, carefully gentle. \u201cCharles,\u201d Erik says, and his voice is a low murmur felt more than heard, and Charles takes a moment to be grateful that he\u2019d been grossly exaggerating when he\u2019d told Erik those months ago that he knew everything about him.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>At this point, Charles should probably know to be careful what he wishes for -- which is to say, his elation at Erik agreeing to take responsibility should have been tempered by the realization that Erik was going to interpret that promise extremely broadly.</p>\n<p>The mutant who calls himself Azazel takes them as far as Miami, before announcing that he is inclined to part ways. They end up at in a set of rooms that Eric procures with an enviable command of Spanish, and then Erik begins what he does best: making terrifying plans.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to go to ground for awhile,\u201d Erik announces. \u201cPreferably in another country. I know a place in Canada--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCanada?\u201d Alex says incredulously, as if Erik had suggested they make camp on the moon.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, Erik, I think we can safely return to the mansion, don\u2019t you?\u201d Charles says.</p>\n<p>Erik frowns. \u201cCharles, it\u2019s hardly secure. The CIA is going to figure out that we made it off that beach alive, and from there, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to think where we might go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles bites his lip, because it\u2019s not that he can\u2019t see the sense in Erik\u2019s reasoning. Still -- \u201cI was really rather hoping to go home,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>Suddenly everyone in the room is pretending like they did not just look in the direction of Charles\u2019 stomach, except for Sean, who says, \u201cI dunno, kind of sounds like a bad--\u201d before Alex claps a hand over his mouth.</p>\n<p>Erik, in particular, looks stricken. \u201cCharles, be reasonable, it\u2019s not <i>safe</i>--\u201d</p>\n<p><i>It could be</i>, Charles thinks at him. <i>Moira could take care of it</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Only if you take care of Moira when she\u2019s done</i>, Erik thinks, along with a vague impression of Charles wiping away memories.</p>\n<p>Charles closes his eyes in grief, but even without Erik radiating all of his long-stymied protective impulses, he would know that anonymity was the best protection they had.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the mansion,\u201d Erik says finally. He looks at Angel and Riptide. \u201cWe\u2019re all mutants, we\u2019re all in this together. Come with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t protect us before,\u201d Angel says, her voice cracking in pain and defiance. \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019ll do any better this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Riptide says nothing, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s waiting for a response.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world knows mutants exist,\u201d Erik says. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back from that. All we can change is how we move forward -- they want us separate and weak, but we can take care of each other, be stronger if we fight together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErik,\u201d Charles says, not precisely liking the direction this is going.</p>\n<p>The room is silent for a moment, and then Erik meets Charles\u2019 eyes. \u201cIf it came to it, I would move the earth itself before I let any of you come to harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Riptide tilts his head, and then says, \u201cWe should travel together, and swiftly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey, I have an idea,\u201d Alex says, and that\u2019s when Charles remembers there are worse things than Erik\u2019s plans.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are not hot-wiring a banana truck,\u201d Charles says firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Alex says, looking honestly perplexed instead of defensive.</p>\n<p>Charles pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cIn the first place, that\u2019s grand theft auto.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I\u2019ve totally done that before--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the second place,\u201d Charles says, \u201cthe smell is <i>unbelievable</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPregnancy makes your sense of smell more acute,\u201d Hank volunteers. \u201cAnd we really do need to leave, Professor. Don\u2019t you think you could just -- well, not breathe through your nose for awhile?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will make a special point of throwing up on you,\u201d Charles says darkly, before stripping off his wristwatch and handing it to Erik. \u201cThe owner is dependent on that truck for his livelihood -- we can\u2019t steal it. We\u2019ll buy it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Sean says. \u201cCan I drive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way in hell,\u201d Erik says automatically.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Erik, Raven, and Riptide -- <i>Janos</i>, he\u2019d introduced himself, a wry smile pulling at his lips -- take turns driving, and it\u2019s a long, uncomfortable ride to New York. Moira leaves them in Maryland to make her way to Langley, and while Erik drives, Charles dozes against Hank, his blue fur surprisingly soft.</p>\n<p>He wakes up when Erik climbs into the back of the truck in the middle of the night, Raven having taken over the wheel for the last stretch of road until they cross into Westchester County. It\u2019s dark and he hasn\u2019t rested well, and there are things they probably should talk about at some point. None of it seems to matter when Erik eases him away from Hank\u2019s side and pulls him close, arm around Charles\u2019 waist and fingers resting lightly against his side.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just past dawn when they arrive at the mansion, and the kids all stumble out of the back of the truck. Charles is about to follow suit when Erik hops out first, and then offers him a hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Charles asks dryly.</p>\n<p>Erik looks utterly serious, and so Charles sighs, and accepts his perfectly superfluous assistance in jumping down from the truck trailer. His brain is ticking through a few practicalities -- Janos needs a room, he himself could sincerely do with a shower -- but while he\u2019s certainly operated on less sleep, he hasn\u2019t generally done it after stopping a war and also feeling another man die while inside his head. And so when Raven says to Janos, \u201cThis way, you can take the room next to mine,\u201d Charles gives her a weak smile of gratitude and hauls himself up the stairs to his bedroom in the east wing.</p>\n<p>Erik is hot on his heels -- not without cause, since he occupies a room just down the hall, but he follows Charles to his bedroom door.</p>\n<p>Charles really doesn\u2019t want to do this now, but he stops with his hand on the doorknob. \u201cWe should talk, I know,\u201d he says, rubbing at his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should rest,\u201d Erik says.</p>\n<p>\u201cRest,\u201d Charles echoes. \u201cWhat if Moira calls?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll deal with it. But for now--\u201d Erik trails off, and shifts his weight forward as if he intends to follow Charles inside to make sure he\u2019s tucked into bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Charles says, and then with a remarkable amount of awkwardness, they stare silently at each other for a long moment, Erik with one foot into Charles\u2019 room and Charles still with his hand clenched around the doorknob. \u201cGood night, then, or -- morning, whichever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik looks at him steadily, searching his face for something, but then he merely says, \u201cGood night, Charles,\u201d and makes his way down the hallway.</p>\n<p>Charles closes the door and leans against it, before deciding that a shower can wait, and he only manages to yank off his boots before toppling into bed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Charles wakes up to find Raven\u2019s face about six inches from his. \u201cMnrgh,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Since Raven is his sister, she doesn\u2019t take offense. She knows what he\u2019s like first thing in the morning, so she just waits, watching his face carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Charles says. He feels <i>wretched</i> -- achy all over, and grimy, and what had he been thinking, passing out in his flight suit was clearly a terrible idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to puke?\u201d Raven asks solicitously.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that you mention it,\u201d Charles says, and manages to make it to the bathroom just in time.</p>\n<p>Raven hands him a glass of water when he\u2019s done, and he rinses out his mouth, still on his knees in front of the toilet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have told me,\u201d Raven says. She sounds a little hurt, a little sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you needed the distraction,\u201d Charles says, and when he looks up in the mirror, Raven is <i>furious</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep -- you can\u2019t keep <i>doing</i> this, Charles, you can\u2019t keep making decisions for me,\u201d she says, and her form melts back to her natural blue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, as sincerely as he knows how. \u201cI was going to tell you. I mean, as soon as I figured out how. It\u2019s not exactly -- you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNormal?\u201d she says, and sinks down next to him, wrapping one arm around his shoulders. \u201cWe were never going to be normal, Charles.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs and then offers her a weak smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more mutation, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>She strokes his hair with her fingers. \u201cGet cleaned up, and come downstairs,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s breakfast waiting, and Erik\u2019s already made two cups of coffee that he let go cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles moans and hangs his head over the toilet again. \u201cCan\u2019t I just be indisposed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty minutes,\u201d Raven says firmly, and shuts the bathroom door behind her.</p>\n<p>He sighs again and begins to strip off his flight suit.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When he enters the kitchen, Erik stands abruptly and pulls out the chair next to him, looking impatient.</p>\n<p>Charles sincerely wishes he could turn around and go back upstairs, but Raven is already coming over with a plate of food, and, well. There\u2019s no point in making this more hideously awkward than it already is. He sits down and lets Erik help push his chair in, but there\u2019s nothing he can do about his ears burning in embarrassment.</p>\n<p>And then Erik goes and pours him a cup of tea and adds just the right amount of milk that Charles likes when he\u2019s feeling under the weather, and places it in front of Charles without comment.</p>\n<p>Everyone is staring at them, and Charles just can\u2019t deal with this yet, and decides to nibble on some toast to see whether it will help settle his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need a doctor,\u201d Hank blurts out from across the table. \u201cI mean, an obstetrician. I\u2019m really not qualified to--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHank, I\u2019m going to venture that <i>no one on this planet</i> is actually qualified for this,\u201d Charles says, his tone a little more sharp than he intended.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll start with the best, and they\u2019ll learn quickly,\u201d Erik says resolutely, with something of an implied <i>or else</i>. He flicks a glance at Charles\u2019 plate. \u201cEat that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles frowns at him, because he didn\u2019t need to be told, and also, Erik had never been so solicitous of him, in public or otherwise. He can\u2019t say he blames the children for being so surprised to hear that he was pregnant -- not just the pregnancy part, but the part where he and Erik have been up to anything over the summer that might <i>lead</i> to pregnancy. That they were becoming reasonably good friends was obvious -- that Erik was slipping into Charles\u2019 bedroom late most nights was, by design, less so.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what the big deal is,\u201d Alex says to Hank, talking with his mouth full. \u201cCan\u2019t you just read Dr. Spock and wing it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone at the table turns to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou read Dr. Spock?\u201d Sean asks, incredulous.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not like you have a lot of choices in prison when it comes to reading material. Anyway, Dr. Spock thinks women know way more about having babies and stuff than science does, so I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re freaking out about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Women</i>,\u201d Charles says, his headache starting to come back. \u201cNot me, Alex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex shoves more food in his mouth. \u201cBabies feel, right? Before they\u2019re born. Can\u2019t you just check in once in awhile, make sure it\u2019s doing okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles opens his mouth once, and then closes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be safer to limit contact with humans,\u201d Erik says. He pours Charles another cup of tea.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Erik</i>,\u201d Charles hisses.</p>\n<p>Erik gives him a bland, unrepentant look in return.</p>\n<p>Hank is hunching his shoulders, and looking more than a little terrified, but he says, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I mean, as long as you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles is torn between reassuring Hank and having a nice panic attack. Anxiety is coming off Hank in waves, though, and so Charles decides to peek just to make sure that Hank isn\u2019t overstating his ability to learn midwifery in a hurry. A shocked laugh escapes him and he says, \u201cHank, don\u2019t be ridiculous -- of course you can do a physical exam, what makes you think--\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns to look at Erik, who is staring Hank down in stony silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cErik, <i>honestly</i>,\u201d Charles says, rolling his eyes. \u201cWell, Hank, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll both...learn a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives Hank his best encouraging smile, but Hank just gulps and nods. Erik turns his attention back to Charles then, watching him eat with a disturbing amount of interest -- and Charles would yell at him again, he really would, but it turns out he\u2019s actually quite hungry, after all.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The rest of the day -- what\u2019s left of it, anyway -- passes in a strange flurry of routine activity. It feels odd to watch Sean hang laundry on the line outside, but the world doesn\u2019t stop just because they stopped a war. Janos had offered to make dinner, and the smells floating out of the kitchen make Charles\u2019 stomach gurgle in anticipation.</p>\n<p>He hears the study door open behind him, but instead of Raven or Erik, it\u2019s Angel who comes up quietly behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d she asks eventually.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm? Oh, yes, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d Charles says, almost absently.</p>\n<p>Angel crosses her arms them, looking out the window and not at his face. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s just -- I knew some girls who didn\u2019t plan on it, but. You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles could guess, even if Angel wasn\u2019t broadcasting a series of faces, surprise and despair and sadness and joy. \u201cI\u2019m not certain it feels real to me,\u201d Charles confesses, and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI keep remembering and then wondering if I\u2019m not hallucinating.\u201d</p>\n<p>She does look at him, then. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she says, and Charles marvels that someone so scared can sound so determined. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to do it alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fortunate in that regard. I have all of you,\u201d he says, and offers her an honest smile along with the deliberate inclusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Erik?\u201d she asks, and it takes him a moment to separate out the strands of emotion, to realize that she\u2019s <i>worried</i>, because she\u2019s seen too many women abandoned to less than ideal circumstances.</p>\n<p>He wishes he could give her some easy reassurance, but he has none to give on this score. \u201cErik,\u201d Charles says carefully, \u201cbelieves in protecting all mutants. I do not think he will desert this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods, and squeezes his arm once before she slips out of the study.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The general consensus seems to be that an early bedtime is in order -- Raven and Sean nod off in front of the television, and Charles has read the same three paragraphs without absorbing their meaning. It\u2019s Erik who finally stands and says, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day -- go get some rest.\u201d The children -- Charles really should stop calling them that, he should, people who have fought a battle and faced down missiles are not children -- and Janos rouse themselves and shuffle off to bed.</p>\n<p>Charles stares at the fireplace while they go, until Erik gently tugs the book from his hand. \u201cYou too, Charles,\u201d he says. \u201cYou especially.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles doesn\u2019t much care to be told what to do, but it wouldn\u2019t really do to be petulant, particularly when Erik is probably right. Erik follows him upstairs again to his bedroom, and this time, follows him right in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really not in the mood,\u201d Charles says shortly.</p>\n<p>Erik runs his thumb over the post of the four-poster bed, probably tracing the inlaid filigree. \u201cLet me sleep with you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d Charles snaps, unbuttoning his cardigan with more violence than is probably necessary.</p>\n<p>Erik is silent for a moment, but frustration is roiling just under the surface. \u201cI don\u2019t like you in here by yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles gives him an unfriendly look. \u201cHow strange that it didn\u2019t bother you before now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d Erik says, and walks around the bed to Charles\u2019 side. There\u2019s no trace of Erik in the room, no possessions left behind, but though he never slept next to Charles through the night, he never left right away, either -- and he always slept on the right side of the bed, nearest to the door. Erik pulls Charles close by strong hands on his hips, and even though Charles is still feeling decidedly prickly, he allows it.</p>\n<p>The next words are spoken against the crown of Charles\u2019 head. \u201cIt would make me -- feel better,\u201d Erik says haltingly, like the words are part of a language he doesn\u2019t know yet. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are things Charles could say, and he\u2019s all out of sorts -- he <i>knows</i> this, but can\u2019t seem to stop it. But Erik\u2019s arms are warm around him, and it\u2019s comforting, and Charles doesn\u2019t want to fight right now about motivations and what this means.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he says, and he can feel Erik\u2019s muscles relax a little.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He wakes up once in the middle of the night. He and Erik started out on separate sides of the bed, but they\u2019ve migrated to the middle, so that Erik\u2019s long frame is bent around his, as naturally as metal bends to Erik\u2019s mind. He can feel Erik\u2019s breath stir the hair at the nape of his neck, but that\u2019s not what woke him.</p>\n<p>Even if Erik were not in the room, Charles would not be alone. He can feel it, a little pinpoint of brightness growing even stronger, nothing recognizable as thoughts or consciousness or anything except <i>existing</i>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s there, and it shouldn\u2019t be but it is -- and it\u2019s <i>marvelous</i> as the day he first met Raven and realized he wasn\u2019t alone, and <i>terrifying</i> because of all the futures he imagined for himself, he\u2019s never imagined anything like this.</p>\n<p>Erik mutters something in his sleep, lips moving against Charles\u2019 neck, arm flexing around Charles\u2019 midsection before relaxing. Charles wonders belatedly if he\u2019s been a bit sloppy, broadcasting while Erik is wrapped mentally and physically around him, but Erik\u2019s dreams are innocuous, all memories of sensation and a warm breeze and no obvious bleed-through of Charles\u2019 anxiety.</p>\n<p>He sighs, and pushes himself back just the tiniest bit against Erik, and lets his eyes fall shut again.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He wakes up in a different mood, though, chiefly because he has to struggle out of Erik\u2019s grip to make it to the ensuite bathroom, where he suspects he is going to be spending a lot of time.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s aware of Erik standing in the doorway, the undershirt and boxers he wore to bed rumpled from sleep and some strange expression on his face that Charles chooses not to investigate in favor of being noisily sick. But Erik just runs the tap and fills a glass with water before crouching next to Charles. \u201cReminds me of Chicago,\u201d he says, and he has the gall to sound amused.</p>\n<p>Charles grabs the glass from him and rinses his mouth out. \u201cI told you, that was from a migraine, not from drinking too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time he makes it down to the kitchen, Hank is lying in wait for him.</p>\n<p>He is just putting the kettle on the stove when Hank says, \u201cI think you should stop drinking tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles squints at him. \u201cRubbish,\u201d he concludes.</p>\n<p>Hank throws down a slim stack of periodicals like a gauntlet. \u201cNo, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik and Raven come into the kitchen then, and Raven says, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHank wants me to treat my body like a temple,\u201d Charles grouses, giving up on the kettle in favor of pulling out a chair at the table.</p>\n<p>Apparently emboldened by Charles\u2019 acquiescence, Hank says, \u201cDefinitely no smoking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, I barely smoke at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Raven coughs, and he viciously regrets having shared any of the contents of the tin that resides behind several books in his study.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I think you should stop drinking alcohol, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>completely ridiculous</i>,\u201d Charles says firmly, but the thoughtful way Erik is nodding his head probably means that all liquor in the house is going to find itself temporarily fused inside a metal box with no opening.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Mice trials</i>,\u201d Hank says urgently, and Charles skims the summary of several articles off the top of Hank\u2019s mind, and blanches.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, no drinking, no smoking, no -- oh good lord, no tea for seven more months, I\u2019m going to die,\u201d Charles says mournfully.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t the only surprise Hank has waiting for him, although he waits until later in the afternoon to ask Charles to come down to the lab. Erik, who has been more or less dogging his footsteps, doesn\u2019t wait for an invitation to accompany them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this, then?\u201d Charles asks politely, looking at a hodgepodge of metal and dials.</p>\n<p>Hank fiddles with a few things, turning switches that bring the machine to life. \u201cAh, well, we confirmed the pregnancy with blood and urine samples--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I was there,\u201d Charles says. \u201cYou were like a vampire, honestly, I don\u2019t think you needed all of that blood--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I thought you\u2019d like to see it with your own eyes,\u201d Hank continues on.</p>\n<p>Charles opens his mouth once, and then shuts it. \u201cI don\u2019t recall have a sonography machine on the grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, there wasn\u2019t one, I built it last night,\u201d Hank says, pushing his glasses up.</p>\n<p>Both Erik and Charles stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Hank explains. \u201cSo -- Professor, if you\u2019ll just, um, unbutton your shirt, then I can put the gel on your stomach and we can--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s safe,\u201d Erik says, and it\u2019s not a question. Also, he is looming over Charles in rather disconcerting way.</p>\n<p>Hank doesn\u2019t growl, but he does give Erik an impatient look. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Professor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles sighs and hops up on the table that Hank indicates, and he fumbles with the buttons on his vest before Erik steps in and stills his hands, silently undoing the rest of the buttons and sliding the vest off Charles\u2019 shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really needn\u2019t,\u201d Charles says under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik does not respond, except to hesitate just briefly at the top button of Charles\u2019 shirt before carefully undoing the rest. Charles draws the line at letting Erik undo his belt, and takes care of pushing his trousers and underwear out of the way himself.</p>\n<p>Then Charles wrinkles his nose at the cold gel -- Hank does at least apologize for that -- and pressing a wand uncomfortably on his belly while looking at a screen, which bears some resemblance to the illustrations in his anatomy textbooks.</p>\n<p>And then Hank says, \u201cOkay, here, and oh, oh wow--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck <i>me</i>,\u201d Charles breathes, wide-eyed.</p>\n<p>Hank\u2019s hand trembles a bit, but Erik steadies the wand in place, as the three of them stare at what is very obviously a fetus.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel we should study this,\u201d Charles says, hands gripping the edge of the table until his knuckles are white. \u201cI also feel very much like having a nice fit of hysterics, which might be first. Don\u2019t hold it against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy god,\u201d Erik says, his voice rough. Charles looks at his face to see what that means -- Erik has grown adept at walling his thoughts off, and Charles won\u2019t look without permission -- but there\u2019s no revulsion in Erik\u2019s expression, not at all. Erik is staring at the cobbled-together monitor with something that looks like <i>wonder</i>, his fingertips stroking Charles\u2019 belly.</p>\n<p>Hank is flipping through some books. \u201cThis looks right -- ten weeks along, maybe eleven,\u201d he mutters, and then looks up at Charles. \u201cDoes that -- I mean, that timeline, it\u2019s possible, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Erik surprises him by answering, and Charles gets a flash of skin and warmth and Erik\u2019s tongue dragging down Charles\u2019 spine on a sweltering August evening.</p>\n<p>Hank looks relieved. \u201cOh good, because I was really a little worried that all of my references were going to be useless since it\u2019s a mutation, and if this is a survival mechanism, I had to consider whether the Professor was reproducing asexually--\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles wheezes. \u201cYes, thank you, Hank, very interesting from an evolutionary perspective, but it seems unlikely. Under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Hank says, but Charles is aware that Hank is making some unnervingly calm mental calculations about Erik\u2019s stamina and how long it took to impregnate Charles and whether Charles\u2019 mutation had been there all along or if it only responded to stimuli, and that\u2019s when Charles calls a halt to this whole business and gets himself cleaned up.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a phone call from Moira that night. There are two telephones in the mansion -- one in the front hall, and the other in Charles\u2019 study.</p>\n<p>He takes the call in his study, not wanting the others to overhear. When Erik slips in the door, he just motions him forward. He actually suspects that Erik can interpret electromagnetic pulses and can listen in on his conversation without much difficulty, but that\u2019s a subject to raise at another time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk long,\u201d Moira says. \u201cBut I\u2019m done. You made it there safe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Charles says. He knows she\u2019s being as discreet as possible, but he\u2019d still rather say nothing much. \u201cWhen can we expect you?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a crackle of static. \u201cThursday,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should--\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s mouth hardens into a stern, displeased line.</p>\n<p>Charles says, \u201cYou should come. We\u2019ll see you Thursday.\u201d</p>\n<p>The line crackles again and then disconnects. Erik doesn\u2019t look that apologetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Charles says carefully, \u201cthat it ought to bother me more. What we\u2019re planning to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if she doesn\u2019t want to talk, someone could make her,\u201d Erik says. \u201cIf you want to stay here, Charles, you know what you have to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles wants to insist that there\u2019s another way, that they could go on the run. But he knows Erik is right. And besides, what kind of life would that be for a --</p>\n<p>He touches his stomach, and even though his belt is at the same notch it always is, there was something about actually seeing the baby today that makes his resolve harden.</p>\n<p>Erik steps close, and his hand comes up as if to cover the one Charles is holding against his belly, but instead he lets it fall back down to his side. \u201cI won\u2019t risk your safety,\u201d Erik says.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s what Charles wanted, surely. For Erik to find a new purpose, to turn away from vengeance. And Charles hadn\u2019t been lying to Angel when he said that Erik would fight to protect all mutants. He just wishes he knew whether Erik would have stayed for Charles alone.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Moira says hello to the children when she arrives, offers a respectful greeting to Janos, and then asks to speak with Charles and Erik privately.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of the records were destroyed when Shaw blew up the facility,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rest were with who you said they\u2019d be, Charles. I destroyed them. Funny thing was -- they didn\u2019t even seem to know they had them in their possession. It was like mutants had completely slipped their mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik raises an eyebrow. \u201cMy, my, Charles, you were busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mistake a disinclination to kill for an unwillingness to protect us from harm,\u201d Charles says evenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to do the same to me,\u201d Moira says. Her voice does not tremble, and she looks him dead in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Moira,\u201d Charles sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d Moira insists. \u201cI can\u2019t tell them what I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the only way I can make sure you\u2019re safe -- all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s brow is furrowed, as though he honestly hadn\u2019t imagined a human was capable of this.</p>\n<p>Moira\u2019s mind whispers <i>be safe be safe take care</i> as Charles slides his fingers against her temples.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hank puts his foot down about the issue of the obstetrician.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor, I promise you that I will do my best to take care of you, but I am <i>not delivering your baby</i>,\u201d Hank says, looking wild around the eyes.</p>\n<p>Charles pauses in the middle of eating toast off Erik\u2019s plate. He\u2019d already consumed his own breakfast, but Erik\u2019s plate is just sitting there next to him, and for all that Erik has definite feelings about <i>his food</i> and the value of fresh fruits and vegetables, all twisted around dark shadows of deprivation, he lets Charles take whatever he wants (although he does frown briefly when Charles filches orange segments).</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the way you feel about it,\u201d Charles says, eyeing the steaming cup of tea in front of Hank with longing.</p>\n<p>Hank gives a frustrated rumble of a growl. \u201cIt has nothing to do with how I feel -- I\u2019m not a medical doctor, and I\u2019m not going to perform surgery on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurgery?\u201d Erik asks sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to need a Cesarean section,\u201d Hank says, looking deeply uncomfortable. In fact, his fur seems to be standing on end around his neck. \u201cHow did you think the baby was going to be born?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles hadn\u2019t actually thought that part all the way out -- to be truthful, he hadn\u2019t gotten much further than a sort of bemused resignation at having to buckle his belt at a new notch. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll make some calls this morning,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Erik looks perturbed and uneasy, but offers Charles another piece of orange before he can steal it.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He and Erik have resumed their regular chess matches in the evening, sans alcohol. Charles would complain bitterly about the scotch embargo, but as Erik has chosen to forgo it in solidarity, it seems a little churlish to whine about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to start a school?\u201d Erik asks skeptically.</p>\n<p>Charles rearranges himself in his chair, leaning forward a bit to move his bishop. \u201cThere are so many of us. I saw them with Cerebro -- and maybe the adults have learned to control their abilities, to live with them, but what about the children? Should we leave them to medical professionals who won\u2019t understand them, or to the government, who will use them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, Charles, you\u2019re starting to sound like me,\u201d Erik says, his lips curving into a wry smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you might like that,\u201d Charles says. \u201cBut I\u2019m absolutely serious. We have the space and the means. We can help, Erik.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik takes one of his pawns with a knight. \u201cAnd who will you get to teach?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles gives him his most charming smile and waits expectantly.</p>\n<p>Erik looks pained. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine what you think I\u2019m suitable to instruct.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do have lovely penmanship,\u201d Charles says, studying the board leisurely. He rests one hand on his stomach, which still doesn\u2019t make him look pregnant but does make him look like an extremely soft academic, overly fond of custard cream and sitting still in libraries.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re already going to have the pitter-patter of one mutant child here before long -- are you really that eager to add countless others at the same time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what,\u201d Charles says, \u201cmakes you think our child will be a mutant?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it --\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles takes Erik\u2019s bishop and raises an eyebrow. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018of course\u2019 about it, my friend. We still don\u2019t understand which genes are responsible for mutations, nor the dominance of these genes. It\u2019s perfectly possible that you and I will end up with a very human child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik stares blankly at the chessboard, where Charles will probably be checkmated in three moves.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d Charles asks gently.</p>\n<p>Erik looks -- Erik looks <i>wrecked</i>. \u201cWhat will I do?\u201d he echoes.</p>\n<p>Charles forces himself to wait.</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant it,\u201d Erik says, his voice gone gravelly. \u201cWhen I said I\u2019d take responsibility. Mutant or no, that won\u2019t change.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not precisely the answer that Charles wanted, but it\u2019s good enough for Charles to lean forward and tip over his king. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could prevail upon you to make me some hot chocolate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik looks slightly surprised at Charles backing off, but he recovers quickly and says, \u201cIf only to prevent you from burning down the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really think we could have salvaged that pot,\u201d Charles says, feeling a little defensive about his attempt to replicate Janos\u2019 recipe the other night.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs always, your optimism astounds me.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, Charles wakes to find Erik pressed close behind him, hand curled so gently against Charles\u2019 stomach as to be almost not touching.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be quite that careful,\u201d he murmurs, tugging up his undershirt and places Erik\u2019s hand firmly against his skin. He can hear Erik\u2019s sudden intake of breath, and then Erik\u2019s fingers cautiously stroke his belly.</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s voice is low and sleep-rough when he says, \u201cI need to go into the city today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Charles asks, yawning. \u201cWell, I do have some errands that need seeing to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s hand stills. \u201cNot a good idea. Just give me a list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really, I don\u2019t actually look pregnant -- in fact I think I\u2019m starting to bear a distinct resemblance to my Uncle Bertie, God rest him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou walk differently,\u201d Erik says. \u201cA list, Charles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Charles says, sulking.</p>\n<p>He sulks more when it becomes clear that Erik is taking Raven and Janos with him, which seems incredibly unfair. He vengefully adds <i>marzipan rolls from Li-Lac Chocolates</i> to his list and thrusts it into Erik\u2019s hand after Erik puts on his greatcoat and trilby, in deference to the late November cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be back for dinner?\u201d Charles asks, feeling uncomfortably like somebody\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p>Erik scans the list, looking thoughtful until he gets to the last item, and then the corner of his mouth quirks in a way that actually makes Charles want to thump him on the arm. \u201cWe should be,\u201d he says. And then, because Erik is obviously an ass, he bends down to press a kiss just to the right of Charles\u2019 mouth.</p>\n<p>It really shouldn\u2019t be enough to leave Charles feeling witless all afternoon, but it is.</p>\n<p>When Erik returns with Raven and Janos in tow, he\u2019s plainly triumphant and self-satisfied, which makes Charles distinctly nervous. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d Charles asks, making a point of not sounding too interested.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfitable,\u201d Erik says with a considerable amount of relish.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you--\u201d Charles stops, because there are far too many people in the room, and he\u2019s not certain what Erik has done, but he is certain that it\u2019s for his ears alone.</p>\n<p>Alex has made a surprisingly credible attempt at a roasted chicken, which delays the questions Charles wants to ask Erik. It\u2019s only after plates are cleared from the table that Charles says, \u201cErik, my study, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik gamely follows him down the hall, and Charles carefully shuts the door before demanding, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik draws a creased note out of his pocket, which is Charles\u2019 list. \u201cI went to your solicitor, as requested, and the library for those articles--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Erik</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI emptied Shaw\u2019s bank accounts and seized his assets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles stares at him, slack-jawed. \u201cYou did <i>what</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJanos knew what he had, for the most part, and Raven\u2019s impersonation was persuasive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErik, I have more than enough money, if you needed some--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about that,\u201d Erik cuts him off. \u201cCharles, can you honestly think of any better use for that money than to help our people?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t, and his expression must say as much.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to me, Charles. You want to open up a school -- that\u2019s fine, and I can help you do that. But it will never be enough to change people\u2019s minds. You <i>know</i> that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might,\u201d Charles says. \u201cIn time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoney will change it, and it will do it more quickly,\u201d Erik says. \u201cMoney in the right men\u2019s pockets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles fundamentally dislikes being surprised so much in one conversation. \u201cAre we talking about large-scale bribery, now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called lobbying, Charles, and it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Charles says, and takes a deep breath. \u201cWell. Not illegal, no. Clever, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I got you this,\u201d Erik says, and Charles doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s kept it out of sight all this time, but there\u2019s no mistaking the distinctive Li-Lac box.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Charles says helplessly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to, I only put it down because I was feeling a bit stroppy about the whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik peers at him. \u201cAre you going to cry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>punch you in the face</i>,\u201d Charles says, and then does nothing of the sort and goes up on tiptoe to kiss him. It starts out tentative and careful, because they\u2019ve never kissed outside of bed before -- and Charles still doesn\u2019t know what the hell Erik wants, if he wants this, but if he\u2019s going to go to the effort of retrieving marzipan rolls from a confectionery in the Village, then the least he can do is stand still while Charles kisses him in thanks.</p>\n<p>The door to the study swings open, then, and Raven says, \u201cCharles, did you murder Erik -- <i>oh</i>. Sorry. I\u2019ll just--\u201d</p>\n<p>The moment is broken, and Erik takes a careful step back while steadying Charles with a firm grasp on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m alive, as you can see,\u201d Erik says dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Raven says, and closes the door behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cChess?\u201d Erik suggests, moving away completely.</p>\n<p>Charles thinks very seriously about eating all the marzipan by himself and not sharing any of it.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cOh -- <i>oh my god</i>,\u201d Charles moans.</p>\n<p>Hank looks up uncertainly. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex rolls his eyes. \u201cHank, if you ever get a girl in the backseat of a car and she makes a noise like that, here\u2019s a hint: don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s very charming, Alex, thank you,\u201d Charles says witheringly. \u201cUnfortunately, Hank, he\u2019s right -- please do continue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>,\u201d Angel and Sean hiss in unison, glaring at them before resolutely turning back to <i>The Guiding Light</i>.</p>\n<p>Charles wiggles his toes, and Hank resumes rubbing his feet with a truly enviable degree of muscle control. He\u2019s honestly trying to keep it down, but Hank has his number, and Charles can only make an indecent noise in the back of his throat when Hank rocks his thumb against Charles\u2019 arch, somehow managing to keep his claws well away from skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Erik says, his voice no less threatening for how quiet it is, \u201care you doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles blinks his eyes open. \u201cOh, hello, Erik,\u201d he says, sighing happily.</p>\n<p>Erik looks unamused. Janos, two steps behind him, looks very amused indeed, but Charles has come to realize that Janos has a delightfully perverse sense of humor.</p>\n<p>For all that Hank is now larger than Erik, he still hunches his shoulders. \u201cI was just -- the Professor said his feet were hurting, and I read that massage was therapeutic, so I--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHank, if you\u2019re going to make somebody else\u2019s girl sound like that, you\u2019d better be ready to face the music,\u201d Alex says, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t doing anything!\u201d Hank protests as Charles says, \u201cReally, I\u2019m <i>nobody\u2019s</i> girl--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBack from commercial!\u201d Sean says urgently, and Angel shushes them all again.</p>\n<p>Charles slides his feet out of Hank\u2019s lap and finds his slippers. \u201cLet\u2019s talk in the other room,\u201d Charles says, voice hushed in deference to to the all-important afternoon soaps.</p>\n<p>Erik gives him a hand up, which has stopped being weirdly protective and even patronizing, and has become quite welcome in the face of a rapidly shifting center of gravity.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, how was your...business meeting?\u201d Charles asks, taking advantage of the opportunity to root around in the refrigerator.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have several leads,\u201d Erik says. Charles tries very hard not to think about the fact that Erik\u2019s investigative skills were honed while hunting Nazis, which may or may not lend itself to identifying members of the Congress who can be pressured in advantageous ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, excellent,\u201d Charles says, and pulls out sauerkraut and cheese and rye bread and places them on the counter before retrieving a plate.</p>\n<p>Erik actually doesn\u2019t look repulsed, but that\u2019s probably because Erik bought the sauerkraut in the first place, and also because Charles refrained from adding peach jam to the mix. He leans against the counter next to Charles, and then says, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about you not being my girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, if we could agree never to repeat anything that comes out of Alex\u2019s mouth, that would be a kindness,\u201d Charles says, assembling his sandwich with care.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he was just joking about Hank,\u201d Erik says carefully.</p>\n<p>Charles scrunches up his face. \u201cWhat did I just say about repeating anything Alex says? And anyway, that\u2019s completely inappropriate and where would I even find the -- honestly, Erik, you\u2019re in my bed every night, do you imagine that I\u2019m sneaking out to canoodle in the hallways while you\u2019re asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik looks uncertain.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we just stop talking about it?\u201d Charles pleads, his knuckles white where he\u2019s gripping the edge of the counter. \u201cI have to say, it isn\u2019t very nice of you to -- to be so flippant about it, not when you don\u2019t--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I don\u2019t what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t love me,\u201d Charles said evenly, looking Erik straight in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t love you,\u201d Erik repeats, his tone flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, of <i>course</i> you don\u2019t, I understand that we both got a bit carried away, and it\u2019s not like either of us knew you could knock me up, and believe me, I\u2019m extremely grateful that you haven\u2019t left me to give birth and raise a child alone, but I\u2019m not <i>expecting</i> anything.\u201d Charles sucks in a shaky breath after that.</p>\n<p>\u201cCharles,\u201d Erik says, his tone impossibly tender, \u201cyou are, without a doubt, the dimmest telepath I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely uncalled for--\u201d Charles begins, and then Erik kisses him. It\u2019s just as distracting as the day Erik brought him marzipan, but more so, because Charles is actually trying to think.</p>\n<p>When Erik breaks for air, Charles says suspiciously, \u201cWait, does this mean you really--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor once, can\u2019t you just read my mind and put us out of our misery?\u201d Erik mutters against Charles\u2019 jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <i>now</i> you ask. I was trying to do what you wanted, to give you <i>privacy</i>,\u201d Charles snaps. \u201cYou can\u2019t fault me for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik draws back to look at him. \u201cI thought you knew, but you didn\u2019t want to--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for god\u2019s sake -- what if I\u2019d looked and known for certain that you didn\u2019t care and then had to live with it?\u201d Charles nearly yells, and then grabs Erik\u2019s hair in what is no doubt a painful manner and brings him down for another kiss.</p>\n<p>He feels desperate and relieved and so stupidly, terribly happy that he doesn\u2019t know what to do with it -- and Erik must feel the same way, because he doesn\u2019t stop kissing Charles, just hitches him up on the counter and holds onto him like he\u2019s afraid Charles might go somewhere, like Charles isn\u2019t clutching his thighs around Erik\u2019s waist and sighing into his mouth and trying to touch as much of Erik as he can reach.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is when Sean walks in. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come back later. No, you know what, it\u2019s not that important. Oh god, my eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out, Sean,\u201d Erik growls, and Sean pulls the door shut quickly behind him.</p>\n<p>Charles attempts to pull Erik forward for another kiss, but Erik remains stubbornly where he is. \u201cWhat?\u201d Charles asks.</p>\n<p>Erik actually looks guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy on earth not?\u201d Charles asks, mystified but ready to be offended, depending on the answer.</p>\n<p>Erik touches Charles\u2019 belly in answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, please, you can\u2019t knock me up twice,\u201d Charles says.</p>\n<p>Erik is silent for a moment. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErik Lehnsherr,\u201d Charles says firmly. \u201cStop stalling, and take me upstairs <i>right now</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just a little awkward -- the last time they\u2019d had sex, it was before the beach, and Charles has been decidedly more flexible and certainly capable of riding Erik into the mattress. And he\u2019d done his best, then, to do as Erik wished, and stay out of his head -- but he\u2019d heard things just the same, <i>Charles</i> and <i>so good</i> and things in German that he understood when Erik thought them but could not remember afterward, all passionate threats and taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain rather a lot.</p>\n<p>This time, he allows Erik to maneuver him onto his side with Erik behind him, which is a position he\u2019s now accustomed to waking in, and seems all the more intimate for it. It\u2019s been almost three months of chastely sharing a bed with Erik, never mind that his hormones are going crazy and he\u2019s wanked off in the ensuite with a frequency unknown since his adolescent years.</p>\n<p>He tries to tell Erik this, and when that doesn\u2019t work, he <i>shows</i> him, and Erik growls, \u201cDon\u2019t rush me, Charles. You\u2019re ready when I say you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the one who would know, and I was ready about fifteen minutes ago. In the kitchen, remember that?\u201d Charles says, and then pushes back on Erik\u2019s fingers with a little wiggle and feels a hot flare of lust go up Erik\u2019s spine, and tries not to grin triumphantly but must fail somewhere along the way. He\u2019s not certain whether his mouth or his mind betrays him, because everything is gently open now, porous like sandstone but not a deluge of thoughts and feelings that Erik couldn\u2019t handle.</p>\n<p>By the time Erik finally, finally presses inside, his capacity for rational thought takes a nosedive -- it\u2019s just heat and sensation and Erik\u2019s need to protect him warring viciously with <i>want</i> and <i>missed this</i> and something else, something warm and quiet and deep that might have been there all along,</p>\n<p>Charles basks in it, and then, because he\u2019s never known when to leave well enough alone, he says, \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got, truly? Come on, Erik, put your back into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the <i>mouthiest</i> -- don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Erik mutters against his neck.</p>\n<p>Charles just thinks, <i>you won\u2019t, I trust you</i>, and that\u2019s when Erik grips him behind the knee and raises it, and Erik won\u2019t give it to him faster but does give it to him harder, and it\u2019s not long before Charles curls a hand around his cock and strokes himself a handful of times before coming, Erik groaning behind him moments later.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Charles says after several minutes, still trying to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>Erik presses lazy kisses to his neck and shoulders. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Charles says, stretching a little bit. \u201cOh bother, I forgot my sandwich in the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Erik says. \u201cWe did all of that, and just -- sandwich.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very good, but it made me more hungry, not less,\u201d Charles says. He cranes his head around to flash Erik a smile. \u201cHave I mentioned I\u2019m mad for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, for god\u2019s sake,\u201d Erik mutters, and disengages gently before going to retrieve a washcloth, and then, Charles\u2019 snack.</p>\n<p>That feeling, warm and deep and pure like a tuning fork struck, emanates from Erik all the way down to the kitchen, even though he encounters Janos on the stairs who offers him a handshake.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He\u2019s six months along when Erik comes back to the mansion with Azazel in tow.</p>\n<p><i>A change of heart?</i> Charles asks Erik with cool interest.</p>\n<p><i>He\u2019ll be useful,</i> Erik thinks. <i>He\u2019s ready to stop running.</i></p>\n<p>Charles steps toward Azazel, and holds out his hand. \u201cCharles Xavier. I don\u2019t believe we were, er, formally introduced.\u201d</p>\n<p>Azazel looks at him uncertainly, and then delicately shakes his hand.</p>\n<p><i>I won\u2019t break, you know,</i> Charles thinks in his head.</p>\n<p>Azazel\u2019s expression does not change, but his mental voice is rueful. <i>Lehnsherr made some very specific threats. He is not a man to be trifled with.</i></p>\n<p><i>Nor am I,</i> Charles says with a warning smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re finished posturing,\u201d Raven says from the top of the stairs. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles and Erik watch Azazel climb the staircase, and Charles says, \u201cI wonder what I can get him to teach?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEuropean languages,\u201d Erik says promptly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a chance. You\u2019re not getting out of that, and he doesn\u2019t know German and his French is only so-so,\u201d Charles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you might feel that way,\u201d Erik says, but he doesn\u2019t sound enormously put out. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have your feet up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was on my way to the kitchen to get a snack,\u201d Charles says.</p>\n<p>Erik grimaces. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles rolls his eyes and makes his way to the kitchen. It\u2019s not that disgusting, he reasons, and pulls the peach jam out of the fridge.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s March, and there aren\u2019t enough pillows in the world to prop him up in bed to read comfortably. He lies on his side, a pillow in between his legs as he skims an article that was apparently peer-reviewed by a group of drunk and disorderly chimpanzees, for all the sense the experimental parameters make. He\u2019s not paying very close attention, though, because something else is bothering him.</p>\n<p>\u201cErik,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Erik is sitting up against the headboard, reading Rilke with a thoughtful twist to his lips. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Azazel is looking at my sister in an improper way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOther way around, Charles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles sniffs. \u201cBe that as it may.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik turns a page. \u201cRaven can take care of herself. And besides, I think he\u2019s actually a gentleman. You could always read his mind if you were really concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Charles says, dissatisfied, knowing he\u2019ll do nothing of the sort without cause.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could make a rule. Only one pregnant Xavier at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are terrible and I loathe you,\u201d Charles says. \u201cRub my back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch hardships I endure,\u201d Erik says, but the corners of his mouth are turned up.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Epilogue:</p>\n<p>Raven looks grim, indeed, when she walks into the mansion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s the matter?\u201d Charles says, reaching out to take Kurt from her arms. Kurt goes willingly enough, blinking wide golden eyes at him before dissolving into giggles when Charles sends out a tickling touch to his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo take-backs on babysitting,\u201d she says, narrowing her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, Raven,\u201d Charles says. \u201cI would never. After all the times you\u2019ve watched Wanda--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPut Kurt down, and you\u2019ll see,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Charles obediently sets Kurt down on the floor. His legs are still unsteady, and he holds on to Charles\u2019 shin for support, his tail wrapping around Charles\u2019 ankle.</p>\n<p>Raven crouches down and holds out her arms. \u201cCome to Mommy, Kurt,\u201d she says, giving him a big smile.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a <i>ploof</i> of air displacing, not quite a crack, and Kurt is suddenly clinging to Raven\u2019s outstretched arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my,\u201d Charles says, wide-eyed. <i>Erik, come see this.</i></p>\n<p>Erik comes down the stairs, Wanda perched on his hip. \u201cRaven,\u201d he says in greeting, giving her a short nod. Kurt sees them and babbles something before teleporting three feet closer to the foot of the stairs, then another two feet, and then the plops down on his bottom and starts to cry in frustration.</p>\n<p>Erik puts Wanda down, who looks curiously at Kurt like she can\u2019t understand why he\u2019s making so much noise, and then Erik scoops Kurt up and says something quietly in German. Kurt hiccups once and stops crying, his little hands fisted in Erik\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cCharles Xavier,\u201d Raven says in a low voice, \u201cget that look off your face right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d Charles says dreamily.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a school to run? And weren\u2019t you the one who complained <i>all the time</i> about how hard it was to child-proof the mansion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would have been difficult even without her mutation,\u201d Charles says dryly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but this place is a bit on the enormous side. And besides, it\u2019s all child-proofed now, or as much as it\u2019s going to be.\u201d Hank had gone a little overboard when designing the first baby-gates for the mansion, which was how they found out that Wanda had a way with machines -- she touched them and they did what she wanted, which was inevitably to place herself in situations designed to give everyone a heart attack.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you want another one?\u201d Raven says skeptically. She sound exhausted, and if Charles knows parenthood, she\u2019ll spend every spare second of her trip to D.C. catching up on her sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Charles says, eyes still locked on Erik, who is murmuring something to a transfixed Kurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I talking about, you probably want nine,\u201d Raven says under her breath.</p>\n<p>Erik joins them, Wanda trailing close behind him before making a break for it and throwing her arms around Charles\u2019 knee. Charles reaches down to pat her head, taking care to not muss the pigtails he\u2019d tied up in her hair that morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d Erik asks. \u201cRemember, Caughner first, then Lewis--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen Willis, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Raven says. \u201cPiece of cake. That bill will never hit the House floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis would be kind of terrible to listen to if I didn\u2019t agree with everything you were doing,\u201d Charles observes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDemocracy in action,\u201d Raven says with a cocky grin, and shifts from her natural blue to an indeterminately middle-aged man.</p>\n<p>Kurt, who seems to know his mother in all forms, reaches out for her and makes a squeal of dissatisfaction when Erik prevents him from attempting to escape Erik\u2019s arms and brain himself on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe good, honey,\u201d she says, and kisses him on the forehead. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a little colicky, so feel free to...\u201d she wiggles her fingers next to her temple.</p>\n<p>\u201cRaven!\u201d Charles says. \u201cI would never.\u201d When Raven and Erik give him frankly disbelieving stares, he amends, \u201cAll right, but only as a very last resort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Raven pats him on the shoulder. \u201cOther parents just use cough syrup,\u201d she says by way of consolation. \u201cAzazel will pick him up on Monday if I\u2019m not back first.\u201d She kisses Charles on the cheek, and makes it out the door before Kurt begins to protest this state of affairs.</p>\n<p>Later that night, after the students are all in their rooms for the night and the children have been put to bed, Charles reaches for the book on his nightstand while Erik is brushing his teeth in the bathroom. When Erik comes to bed, Charles expects him to take up his book as well, but Erik just clears his throat. \u201cCharles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, the next one isn\u2019t going to be a surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that like I had any choice whatever about--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCharles,\u201d Erik interrupts him, taking the book from his hands and looking him in the eye, \u201cI meant -- not a surprise to either of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Charles says, processing that for a moment. \u201c<i>Oh</i> -- you mean like -- wait, you know that Hank never actually determined a few key factors, so we really don\u2019t know what sort of variables control whether or not I\u2019m -- you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik shrugs a little. \u201cWe managed well enough the first time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine if we tried on purpose,\u201d Charles says, and they look at each other for a long moment, contemplating that particular future, before Charles pounces and Erik laughs and, fortunately, remembers to lock the door.</p>"
