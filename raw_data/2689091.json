The broad slope of the nose, the jut of the chin, the serious brow. He shifts his eyes to the right.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Born March 10 of 1917, Sergeant James Barnes was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, where he spent his youth working physically demanding jobs. Barnes\u2019 family was a small one, and numerous accounts confirm that he spent the majority of his time with childhood best friend Steve Rogers. In 1943, Barnes was drafted to the European front. After less than a year of active combat, Barnes\u2019 unit was captured, and he was subjected to torture, isolation, and depravation for, historians have estimated, somewhere between four and eight weeks. In an ironic twist of fate, the prison camp was liberated by none other than\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>Instead of reading the rest of it he shuffles along with the other people. They are all being very quiet. Several are bent over a little glass box. Inside is a leather book. It\u2019s too small for everyone to see, and so the pages are copied up in big projections on the walls. The penmanship is nice.

My hands were shaking real bad when I opened it. I was so afraid, you know; everyone was so afraid of getting a telegram. That\u2019s why it\u2019s torn. But I finally got it open, right before a show, and I remember I had to sit down backstage for the longest time. I just couldn\u2019t stand up, I was so relieved. I think I was late getting on.\u201d\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<em>(Telegram: Barnes, James.14 June 1943. The War in Telegrams: An Interactive Exhibit.

I can just see your face when you read the postmark on this, but really Jersey isn\u2019t all that bad if you just shut your eyes and hold your breath and pretend hard you aren\u2019t in Jersey. Truth is I can\u2019t tell you what I\u2019m doing in Hoboken any more than you can tell me what you\u2019re doing on the front. But you\u2019ll laugh yourself stupid when I finally see you and you find out. I can guarantee that. \u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Anyway I\u2019ll keep it short because you probably don\u2019t have much time to read as it is and I know as usual you\u2019re only interested in unwrapping the goods. I bought you smokes, and not the kind you get in rations either. I got your fancy lady smokes. I had to tell the guy at the store they were for my girl, just to let you know. I'm sure the men in your company will enjoy that story, so do please be sure to tell them it. In detail.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>But j</em> <em>ust think, you can finally have one in peace without me hacking up a lung behind you. They should make it past the censors fine, but I didn\u2019t think matches would, so I hope that either you have some or you\u2019ve knocked together enough of those city slicker brain cells to learn how to make a fire. Stranger things have happened.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Write me (or else you might forget how.) I get a little bored sometimes and trying to guess which horrible obscenities they took out of your letters for purposes of public decency and the war effort keeps me busy between work. Plus unlike some people I sure could use the mental exercise. (Hah, hah.) Or maybe you\u2019ve already sent something and it\u2019s in the mailbox now. In that case don\u2019t mind this.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sorry about the drawing on the back. Not much of a view from my window, is it?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Even if it\u2019s just to send me the empty pack of smokes. Just send something back. If you get this before September and you write fast enough go on and send it to the return address on the envelope. If not just send it to the apartment. It\u2019ll keep.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your pal Steve</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, give it up,\u201d says Dugan. Startled and guilty, Bucky folds up Steve\u2019s letter and squints at Dugan in the dim light of their campfire.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The smokes</em>,\u201d Dugan clarifies, in a theatrical whisper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, hell, Dum Dum,\u201d says Bucky, rolling his eyes. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t got any.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Dugan says. \u201cI know your girl is sending you some. Those envelopes you get always have a little something in them, and this month it was rectangle-shaped. And if they were Lucky Strikes, Barnes, I swear to God \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo girl.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan heaves a sigh. \u201cSorry, Jesus. Your old lady, then? That it? You married?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky thinks suddenly of Steve\u2019s fantastic lack of skill in the kitchen and has to bite down on the inside of his cheek. <em>Wife</em> \u2014 Jesus. Dugan would get a black eye if Steve ever heard that one. Better guys have wound up with broken noses for less.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, you <em>ever</em> shut up?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll trade you some of my D-ration for one cigarette,\u201d Dugan pushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHope you\u2019ve got matches,\u201d says Bucky, relenting, \u201cBecause I\u2019m fresh out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls out the pack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"<em>Marlboros</em>?\" Dugan asks. \"Those are lady's smokes.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Fuck you too! Guess that's more for me.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"No, come on.\" Dugan huffs. He\u00a0does have matches, and he lights Bucky\u2019s cigarette with the same match he uses to light his own, sucking on the tip of his forefinger when the flame burns down too fast and licks his skin. Dugan takes a drag and his eyebrows go up. \"These are good.\"</p>\n<p>\"Told you. I used to keep 'em around for the girls I was dating, you know, so I could share a smoke if a lady happened to want one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Got hooked?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I like 'em.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky enjoys a taste of the single chocolate square, thick and sickly sweet. He tucks Steve\u2019s letter into his pocket when Dugan isn\u2019t looking and takes a long drag. The smoke catches thickly in his chest, and with the first rush he goes a little lightheaded from the nicotine. With his eyes closed Bucky pictures Steve\u2019s sketch on the back of his letter. Steve can make anything look beautiful with his pencil, but he\u2019s right: that view of Hoboken really is irredeemably shitty. Just a couple of flat buildings and a gray haze in the air. <em>Jersey </em>\u2014 Jesus Christ, Bucky would rather be on the front than in motherfucking Jersey. That\u2019s what Steve gets, he thinks, for not listening to what Bucky tells him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll write back tomorrow, after they march. It\u2019s October now, and Steve wrote his letter in September \u2014 Steve will be worried. His brow will be furrowing up in the middle; his mouth will be turning down at the corners. Chewing on a thumbnail in that way he has.</p>\n<p>When Bucky stirs, down to the end of his smoke now, a glint in the low firelight catches his eye. Dugan\u2019s polishing his brass knuckles. Of course brass knuckles are ten different kinds of illegal in the Army, but Bucky doesn\u2019t see any reason to tell the higher-ups about them, considering how useful they are for hand-to-hand. Dugan\u2019s had them since Basic. If he gets his sorry ass blown up he\u2019s promised they belong to Bucky, and so it\u2019s a good investment overall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan is a man who\u2019s prone to filling up silences, and so he talks as he scrubs. \u201cDon\u2019t think I ever told you,\u201d he says, \u201cLike to think of these as my good luck charm. Helped me out of a lot of scrapes growing up.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou grew up in goddamn Midtown,\u201d says Bucky, squinting at him. \u201cNobody gets into scrapes in Midtown.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nDugan snorts. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. I\u2019ve got this real special ability, see. I can start a fight anywhere. During a picture, on the train\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Completely despite himself, Bucky feels a smile tug at his mouth. \u201cKnow a couple people like that,\u201d he admits, closing his eyes again. Rogers, spitting mad, his little fists flying. Bucky hopes to God that he\u2019s not planning on opening his mouth in Jersey. It\u2019s not a good place to get caught in a dark alley.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThose <em>your</em> good luck charm?\u201d asks Dugan, interrupting Bucky\u2019s thoughts. He nods in Bucky\u2019s general direction. It takes him a second to get it, but when he does he almost groans out loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cDugan, you\u2019re like a dog with a bone,\u201d Bucky complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, they must be,\u201d Dugan muses. \u201cBecause you\u2019re bulletproof, Barnes. \u2014Get it? Bulletproof Barnes. I swear, you\u2019re the luckiest son of a bitch I ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a good one. \u201cNah,\u201d Buck says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust last week! Got your helmet blown clean off your head while they were shelling us, and not a single scratch on you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky shoots Dugan his best lazy grin and shrugs, beyond ready for this conversation to be over. \u201cMust be the perfume she sprays on the letters before she sends \u2018em.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan barks out a laugh. He tucks his brass knuckles back into the pocket where he keeps them hidden. \u201cI\u2019ll take first watch, how\u2019s that sound?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re marching early tomorrow,\u201d Bucky warns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSarge, you\u2019re about to drop. Get your beauty rest, cuddle up to your letters.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d Bucky agrees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His arms and his back ache from carrying the rifle. They really are marching early tomorrow, and Bucky can already feel in his bones that it\u2019s going to be an ugly fight. He might as well get some shut-eye now. He settles himself down curled up by his gun and starts composing his letter back to Steve. It\u2019s fine out here, just fine, he\u2019ll write. Warm sometimes, even. He\u2019ll find a story to tell. One of Dugan\u2019s dirty jokes, or a licentious description of French girls. He wants Steve to laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time dawn breaks murky and pink on the horizon they\u2019ve already been humping for a mile through the cold wet of Austria. There\u2019s a lot of waiting to be had in war, and the shelling doesn\u2019t start until dusk. Time bleeds and stretches. It lasts for maybe an hour or two before the enemy pulls back. But then something strange happens to the ground. It tilts and shifts and vibrates beneath them. The dirt is disturbed; it bounces and hums. For a moment he\u2019s convinced it\u2019s an earthquake. Then he sees the tanks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to die?\u201d is what Dugan keeps hissing at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019not,\u201d Bucky slurs. \u201cI\u2019m not. They were gonna kill that kid.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now they\u2019re gonna kill <em>you</em>,\u201d Dugan says, and then swears, \u201cJesus,\u201d and tries to catch Bucky when he stumbles \u2014 but he grabs him wrong, and it just makes his ribs hurt more.</p>\n<p>The prisoners here turn into apes by night, climbing the bars and screaming profanities, usually stuck with cattle prods for their trouble. Bucky is glad for when it\u2019s day and some of them are put to work. But then night comes, and they take another man off to wherever they\u2019re taking them. By morning it\u2019s time to put the body in the furnace. The smell was terrible at first. Metallic: sometimes burning steak, and sometimes musky-sweet. A thick perfume.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGettin\u2019 the shit beat out of you for a Jap,\u201d Dugan says, angry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJaps\u2019re supposed to be their allies, ain\u2019t they? So what the hell were they tryin\u2019 to take him for? They better take me. I got Gypsy blood anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t, sit the fuck down.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky laughs, a little delirious from the pain. \u201cFuck you, I do. Half Gypsy; my ma\u2019s side. Number\u2019s up.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Bucky insists. And it\u2019s not just that: he\u2019s a queer, on top of it. He imagines the telegram that Steve will see. THE SECRETARY OF WAR DESIRES ME TO EXPRESS HIS DEEP REGRET THAT\u2026</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost relieved when it turns out he\u2019s right: the next day they shove a bag over his head and march him along a hallway that winds and twists and turns. The room has no windows. The air is still and thick. There is a long steel table, and on it are needles and restraints; he stumbles and falls, and when he lands again he finds himself in a nightmare. He feels hunger. He smells his own skin, and he smells it burn. The masks the men inside wear are white, and they flash and search, and they call him home \u2014 like the beacons of a lighthouse in the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The light blinds him. They speak German. They cut him. They pump him full of chemicals. Their hands are cold. They speak German. They cut him: ribs, hands, soles of his feet \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, you big lug.\u201d A huge hard arm lands around Bucky\u2019s shoulders and he starts, jerked abruptly from the dizzy memory. Steve towers above him. When Bucky tries to stand he stumbles, but Captain America grabs him, steadying, and tries to catch his eye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you staring at?\u201d Bucky demands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even in the dark light of the bar Bucky can see Steve\u2019s face heat up. It\u2019s glorious, and it reminds him that he isn\u2019t still on Arnim Zola\u2019s table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot staring at anything,\u201d Steve lies, caught out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky, his head swimming more from exhaustion than the Glenfiddich, decides to let it go. \u201cWhere\u2019d Agent Carson go?\u201d He damn well knows Agent Carter\u2019s name. Bucky digs up a smile so brittle that he expects his face to crack clean in two. \u201cShe must be waitin\u2019 up for you. Cap.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve flushes darker. It isn\u2019t half as satisfying, somehow, as it was a second ago. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to make an early night of it. Besides, who else is going to help your sorry self back to your bunk?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t let me hold you up.\u201d Bucky can feel his teeth in his mouth and knows his smile is sharklike and mean. \u201cCan\u2019t keep the little lady \u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, get up,\u201d interrupts Steve. He tugs Bucky away from the bar; Bucky stumbles a little and catches himself, afraid of putting too much weight against Steve. And then he realizes that\u2019s not much of a problem anymore, and so he goes ahead and leans against him while they weave their way out of the pub. It\u2019s muggy but cold outside. Bucky doesn\u2019t feel drunk, but he is exhausted. The air helps wake him up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I never got around to writing you back,\u201d says Bucky. Their shoulders knock together, but it feels all wrong: shifted a little up, a little to the left. The whole world tonight feels that way. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now you don\u2019t have to worry about it, huh?\u201d Steve asks. Bucky\u2019s afraid to look at him; that smile is too damn much. He can only take so much torture in a week. <em>God above, </em>he thinks bleakly. I should be a comedian.<em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, we\u2019ll be in the same company. You\u2019ll get sick of me soon enough,\u201d Steve continues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure thing, Rogers,\u201d Bucky says. It isn\u2019t too long of a walk back to where they\u2019re staying, real rooms for real POW\u2019s, Bucky guesses, just a block down from the pub in a weary apartment complex that\u2019s probably more dangerous than a foxhole. They\u2019ve only got it for this one night, and only because the village was so close to camp, but Bucky is far from complaining; he\u2019ll take what he can get, and a real bed is much better than the steel table he thought he\u2019d be sleeping on tonight anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They come up on the building, and Bucky gives the door a jimmy to get it open.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like home, huh?\u201d He asks over his shoulder. The floorboards creak terribly and a G.I. upstairs clearly decided to get the party started early with a couple of squealing girls. Bucky thinks of Carter in that red dress all tight across her body and feels sharply and unexpectedly jealous. He should have tried harder \u2014 he could have picked her up, even with Steve there. He could already have her red lipstick on his collar; he could already be forgetting about this terrible day. Drinking didn\u2019t work. Carter might have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t say anything, his brow pinched in concern, as he follows him up the stairs. He hovers while Bucky unlaces his boots and takes off his jacket and sits down on the bed. Annoyance is tight in Bucky\u2019s throat. He\u2019s tired; he wants to sleep; he wants this guy with his commanding tone and his pressed uniform gone. He wants Steve back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky forces another smile. \u201cWhat, Stevie,\u201d he says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m the most interesting thing you\u2019ve got to be watching right now. Because that dame, she sure had \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve studies him for a second with that face he makes: his eyes sharp, his mouth pinched at one side. Hard and frustrated. \u201cAre you\u2026\u201d he struggles visibly with the words. \u201cWill you be \u2014 okay? Tonight, I mean. On your own.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDocs did a fine job of looking over me,\u201d Bucky replies. That was after, of course, he remembered how to breathe when they came at him with their shiny little instruments. His chest tightens up dangerously at the memory and so he pushes it down. Bucky spreads his arms and tries to grin, but it comes out bitter: he tastes confusion and his own cruelty, sharp like bile. \u201cAll in one piece, see? I mean, maybe not such an impressive piece as you, but you can\u2019t fault me. It\u2019s been a long week.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Exhaustion tugs him down. He waves a hand at Steve and a pain grows in his chest that he doesn\u2019t have a name for. He wants to bury himself in the musty sheets of this sad excuse for a bed until he wakes up back in Brooklyn, like in The Wizard of Oz. And maybe Brooklyn is in black and white the same way as Kansas, but Bucky\u2019s sick to death of color \u2014 sick to death of all the red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky,\u201d says Steve again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, I was serious about you catching up with your girl. Take a couple pointers from the guy a room over; lady who wears red like that, I bet you that she\u2019s a fucking tiger in the \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Steve snaps. Bucky\u2019s words stop short, and, to his intense humiliation, Steve\u2019s sharp tone causes his throat to close right up and his vision to blur. Get a hold of yourself, Bucky tells himself, but he can\u2019t. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothin\u2019, Rogers,\u201d Bucky lies, and badly. He swallows hard. The smile won\u2019t come. \u201cFitter than a fiddle.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve looks torn between granting Bucky the dignity of his lie and forcing him to drain the truth out like an infected wound. But Bucky is still caught in his fever dream. Suddenly he\u2019s not only sure that everything around him is unreal, but that he is, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky?\u201d Steve is saying. His hands are warm and big on Bucky\u2019s neck, and Bucky\u2019s vision swims: he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cBuck! \u2014 Bucky, come on \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky closes his eyes and tries to catch his breath. It doesn\u2019t work, and he\u2019s aware of Steve\u2019s hands while he hovers scared. Abruptly he\u2019s convinced that this is it: this is how he\u2019s going to die. He curls a hand around his abdomen where everything is spinning and his vision starts to blot out. A hand closes over his. It presses his thumb to a wrist and he feels under the pad of it a steady and strong pulse of blood beneath skin. He tucks his head down. He tries to match his breathing to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Steve is saying, though he sounds scared, too. \u201cAlright, see? You\u2019re right here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky is jolted with concern, because he\u2019ll break Steve\u2019s wrist if he holds on any tighter. But then he opens his eyes and sees that Steve\u2019s whole arm is bigger and healthier, even if the veins underneath the pale skin are just as blue and fragile as ever. Steve, no matter the fact that he\u2019s bigger than a house, is just fine; they\u2019re just fine here, together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky looks at him, hard. \u201cYour asthma\u2019s gone, huh?\u201d he asks finally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d agrees Steve. He gives Bucky a smile. When he moves his hands away their knees bump; Bucky realizes belatedly that Steve is sitting now on the bed beside him. \u201cI can run now, too. Lift things. And I heal pretty fast.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s trying not to sound proud but he\u2019s doing a bad job of it. Bucky doesn\u2019t have it in him anymore to be angry, and so he just looks at him, the way he couldn\u2019t in the pub. The jaw might be squarer, the neck definitely thicker, but it\u2019s still Steve\u2019s face. He\u2019d recognize that face anywhere. He\u2019d probably recognize it if he were blind. And individually, it turns out, it\u2019s the features that are the same: the dark brows, those big baby blues, that pretty little mouth. Even his big ugly nose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky has never been so relieved in his entire life. It\u2019s Steve. It\u2019s just Steve, spitfire Steve, with his serious face and his knobby, capable hands. It\u2019s Steve, same as always.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t fix that, though,\u201d says Bucky, and nods at the offending extremity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve eyes go wide and then he starts chuckling, kicking at Bucky\u2019s socked foot with his boot. Thank God for Steve\u2019s nose, Bucky thinks, delirious. That awful crooked beak with the big bump in the middle. If whatever chemicals they gave Steve had fixed his nose, Bucky thinks he would have actually lost his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who the hell\u2019s fault was that?\u201d Steve asks, still grinning. But he keeps looking at Bucky, and looking at him, and his face becomes something different. The moment settles heavily around them, and softly Steve says, \u201cBuck.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a little shaken up,\u201d Bucky admits, because he has to, now. His voice is hoarse, and he feels raw and blown open, like shutters smacking against their window in a storm. \u201cIt\u2019ll pass, you\u2019ll see. All I need is a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here,\u201d Steve offers, stiltedly. \u201cSleep on the floor. In case you \u2014 you know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Annoyed, Bucky wants him to clarify. In case he what? In case he forgets how to breathe again and starts shaking apart in the middle of the night? He isn\u2019t strong like Steve \u2014 isn\u2019t brave. He doesn\u2019t want to be alone, but he doesn\u2019t want to need this. He\u2019s a soldier now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Bucky says, tamping it down. The smile comes out a little better now, and Bucky waves a hand. \u201cSeriously, Steve. Get out of here. Night\u2019s still young.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He avoids mentioning Agent Carter on purpose, because it didn\u2019t work before and it won\u2019t help now. But still Steve looks unsure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only gonna fall asleep,\u201d Bucky insists, and tries to sound as honest as he can. \u201cScout\u2019s honor, Stevie. I\u2019m beat.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve huffs out a breath and nods. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he says. He reaches out and squeezes the top of Bucky\u2019s shoulder with a new and stunning strength. Bucky didn\u2019t even realize how tightly he was holding himself until Steve\u2019s hand forces the tension to bleed away. Steve shakes him gently, and sways him a little, and then he lets go, standing from the poor abused bed with an audible creak. He tugs his dress uniform straight and his pins glint, needles in a haystack, in the dim seedy light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re never doin\u2019 that again,\u201d Bucky says suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve is already halfway across the room. Like all the emotions Bucky has experienced tonight, he feels it wash over him, intense and unexpected and sudden: he has never been so angry in his life. The fury scares him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said,\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice shakes, \u201cYou ain\u2019t ever doing that again. Do you hear me? Don\u2019t you ever follow me into Hell, Steve. Not ever.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t even close to fair and you know it,\u201d Steve bites. He\u2019s angry, too \u2014 finally. Silence falls for a second, and then quietly and stormily he adds, \u201cGoodnight, Buck. Get some rest, please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Bucky, belatedly, and to an empty room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Colonel Phillips stares at Steve with a sort of hard exasperation that says he knows he should have been expecting this. \u201cRogers,\u201d he begins, \u201cPrivate Dugan I\u2019ll sanction, and Sergeant Barnes is the best goddamn gunman in the US Army. But here\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m not entirely sure if you\u2019ve noticed, but it\u2019s illegal for two of these men to serve alongside you, and another two aren\u2019t even enlisted in the US Army at all, considering that they\u2019re from, oh, foreign countries.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, you\u2019ve allowed me the freedom to make my own selection. These are the best men I\u2019ve ever had the honor of fighting alongside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phillips squints. \u201cThey\u2019re the <em>first</em> men you\u2019ve ever had the honor of fighting alongside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey each have a unique skill set that will be invaluable in the field. We\u2019ve proven that we work excellently as a team \u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d interjects Agent Carter, \u201cThe SSR operates internationally, Colonel Phillips. We work with Allied soldiers from all over the world. It isn\u2019t so odd to incorporate two men from the French and British reserves.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone got any excuses for breaking the damn law by adding in Private Jones and Private Morita?\u201d Phillips demands. \u201cAnyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve sets his jaw. \u201cWith all due respect, sir,\u201d he says, \u201cYou make them walk, I\u2019m just fine on the bond sales circuit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, thinks Bucky, that\u2019s a filthy lie, but at least Steve is good at bluffing. He\u2019s peripherally aware of Jones and Morita shifting beside him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can win this war without you, Rogers,\u201d Phillips says, but it\u2019s with no particular venom, and instead just a solid kind of annoyance. Bucky experiences something very disturbing: for the first time in his life he sympathizes immensely with his CO. He wants to get the guy a drink. He knows.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that,\u201d Steve is saying, \u201cBut you might win it a hell of a lot faster with us.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Phillips finally sighs. He points a finger at Steve. \u201cIf this goes pear-shaped, Rogers, you\u2019re going down with me, and we\u2019ll both end up dishonorably discharged, miserable assholes with disgraced names. I hope you understand that. This is about as close as I come to a personal favor. Don\u2019t you dare think of asking me for anything else for the rest of your sad life. I\u2019ll be pulling a lot of goddamn strings to make this happen, and you sure as hell better hope you don\u2019t make me regret it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Steve says, saluting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now here they are, this ragtag bunch of so-called professionals, camped out for the night and waiting for dawn to march to their next assignment in the countryside of France. The unit was drooping with exhaustion and so Bucky volunteered for watch. The territory around them is deserted and quiet, and the fire is burning low.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Steve</em>, he writes, and after a moment scratches it out. He scratches until the name is gone altogether from the page and obliterated completely by the black. Without the distractions of the day Bucky becomes acutely aware that in his boots his feet are sore. The cuts have finally stopped reopening and bleeding all over the inside of his socks, and the scabs, even, are weirdly healed \u2014 but there\u2019s a newness to the soles of his feet, a surprising and strange tenderness that doesn\u2019t feel like any other scar Bucky has on his body, and the skin there is baby pink and sensitive, not a numb white. Even the rub of his wool socks hurts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks about this, and chews on his pen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It sits wrong that he never wrote Steve back. It\u2019s an irrational annoyance. He couldn\u2019t have written back anyway: the post was too far delayed. But Bucky knows that when Steve didn\u2019t get a reply to that letter back in August he was afraid that he was writing to a dead man, and the truth is he might as well have been.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Stevie</em>, Bucky tries again. He scratches it out too. The journal he\u2019s writing in is uncommonly nice: he bought it for Steve, between Basic and shipping out. He had figured he might as well spend the money because he probably wasn\u2019t coming back anyway. But Steve kept refusing it, and he kept pushing it back into Bucky\u2019s hands, and finally he just told him he should keep it, and use it while he was away.</p>\n<p>That was how they used to say it. \u201cAway,\u201d and not \u201cto war.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe three pages are torn out. Bucky has written Steve more letters than that, but not from this notebook. It cost him a pretty penny. He wouldn\u2019t mind if it was Steve writing and drawing in it, but he doesn\u2019t like doing it himself. It feels somehow wasteful. He doesn\u2019t have talented hands the way that Steve does.</p>\n<p>A branch cracks somewhere deeper in the forest. Bucky tenses, and reaches for the knives he keeps strapped now in his boots. But it\u2019s no one; probably just some little bunny rabbit. The stillness that has settled over him dissipates, and he is aware, in a way he never has been before, of each one of his limbs: of his heart beating in the quiet stillness of the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He puts his pen back down on the paper and decides to stop worrying altogether. He doesn\u2019t even have to address it, he figures. It\u2019s not like Steve needs to read it anyway. They\u2019re in the same company, just like he said before; there\u2019s no real need for Bucky to send a letter back anymore. He thinks that if he just puts something down then maybe he can think about something else. And so he just writes down what comes to mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>What I wouldn\u2019t God damn give, </em>Bucky finally manages, <em>for you to have been this healthy three years ago, that winter when you almost died on me in the middle of the night from that rattle in your chest. I spent one month scared as hell that you were going to stop breathing and then two weeks worrying that the next time you coughed there\u2019d be blood in your hand, and you\u2019d be gone from me just like that, same way as your mama before you, God rest her soul. I didn\u2019t think I could stand it, having to bury you. Even now I\u2019d rather eat my own gun than see you dead.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s hands don\u2019t shake when he\u2019s scared or nervous anymore; he wouldn\u2019t be the best sniper in the US Army if they did. It\u2019s been beaten out of him well and good. But he feels something burning and panicked rush through him all the same as the truth stares back at him from the page.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I hate them, </em>Bucky continues. He can\u2019t stop now. He could never say this out loud. The fact is terrifying and giddy. <em>I hate them for what they did to you. You won\u2019t ever understand that, I don\u2019t think. I mean, sure, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re finally in one piece and I don\u2019t have to worry about a strong wind knocking you over. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t have bad lungs and that it doesn\u2019t hurt when you walk for too long. The outside finally matches the inside, and now everyone \u2014 the whole world, I guess \u2014 can see just what it is you\u2019re made of. I\u2019m not mad about that.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s selfish maybe but I didn\u2019t want you out here. When I shipped out I kept thinking, at least he\u2019s stowed away safe. I even thought, when I get myself killed out there, maybe it\u2019ll convince him to stop trying to get in. And that was the one good thing I had in my head every time I was listening to enemy fire, convinced I wasn\u2019t making the march back. So what if you volunteered, like you said. You\u2019ve always been your own. The one thing you\u2019ve always been, hell or high water, is your own. Can\u2019t deny you that. I would never try besides. But you\u2019re going to see killing, these next couple days. You\u2019re going to see the truth of the world, and the hell that lives inside. So answer me this, and be honest now: Isn\u2019t that just trading out one sickness for another?\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s breakin\u2019 my heart,\u201d Bucky sighs, and then yells, \u201cStevie! You\u2019re breakin\u2019 my heart.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve flips him off without turning around. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t have good aim \u2014 his aim is fine, really. He just doesn\u2019t have much experience, and it shows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s raining, but not a cold rain, or a heavy one. It\u2019s always raining outside Italy, and when it isn\u2019t raining there\u2019s enough mist to make up for it. Dugan and Bucky and the rest of the team have huddled under a messily assembled tarp, sitting on overturned crates and rickety, liberated stools. Around them the camp rustles with NCOs trudging through the muck and men screaming from the med tent. It\u2019s quiet, all things considered. A quiet day. Waiting on orders. There\u2019s much less busywork to do in a commando unit. Bucky could get used to this. It\u2019s the life.</p>\n<p>Steve takes a shot at a soup can yards away on the fence, and it hits, and zings into the mud. Jones whoops. Steve takes another, and misses.</p>\n<p>\u201cCap ever been on the front? I mean, front lines?\u201d asks Dugan.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bucky says, and squints, watching Steve reload. \u201cNo, he has not.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knows Dugan and Morita exchange a look. There\u2019s something different about being on the front lines. It changes a man. It explains a lot, Bucky thinks, about how Steve is. He stands and lights up a cigarette and walks over to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHand it over,\u201d Bucky says. Steve does. It\u2019s Bucky\u2019s rifle, anyway. \u201cI know what your problem is. It shoots different when the barrel is hot. In combat you ain\u2019t gonna get the chance to let it cool down, not if you\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re having to pick them off during a melee. My girl tends to go left. So tug it right, you understand? You\u2019ll feel it. Gentle.\u201d He demonstrates. Bang-pop, and the furthest can disappears. Dugan and Falsworth applaud like they\u2019re at a golf tournament, and Bucky turns around and gives a dignified bow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve takes the gun back, but he\u2019s looking at him. \u201cYou really are the best in the Army, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky shrugs, and takes a drag off his cigarette. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s being bashful; it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t like to think about it. Sometimes he hopes he\u2019ll wake up and forget how to hold a gun altogether. \u201cThey picked me out during Basic, gave me some training. I couldn\u2019t tell you about it. Wasn\u2019t allowed.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why were you on the front lines?\u201d How\u2019d you get captured, is the real question. Why weren\u2019t you being put to use the right way? Steve still doesn\u2019t know how the Army really works. It\u2019s possible he never really will, at this rate. Commando units are different than working in the infantry, or the tanks, or even the caissons. It\u2019s more dangerous, of course, what they\u2019re doing now. But there\u2019s something about being in the trenches that Steve will never understand.</p>\n<p>Thank God for that.</p>\n<p>\u201c107th\u2019s CO got blown up,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cWeren\u2019t enough men, and they needed someone sent in. It was me or the secretary.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve huffs a laugh. It\u2019s funny, but Bucky isn\u2019t joking \u2014 it really would have been the secretary. Steve gets the next shot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Bucky says, and grabs the back of Steve\u2019s neck to give him a little shake, proud. \u201cReal good, Rogers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve ducks his head. \u201cAlright, alright.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey teach you how to shoot a pistol?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as good as you can, probably.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky looks at him for a moment. He leans closer and keeps his voice low. Nobody else needs to hear this. \u201cYou kill anyone?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you killed anyone yet?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve thinks about it. \u201cI think so. No, I must have. There was \u2014 yeah,\u201d Steve says. He\u2019s just realizing it. \u201cYeah. Yes, I have. Four or five. Maybe more.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt bother you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve decides. \u201cNo, I was doin\u2019 it \u2014 well. In the base. I was doing it for a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Buck.\u201c Steve\u2019s mouth is a thin, pale line. He squares his shoulders, like he\u2019s ready to fight about it again, and says: \u201cI had to.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A huge and wonderful and dreadful feeling wells inside Bucky. This is just like anything else with Steve: if Steve wants to follow him down this road he\u2019s going to do it, and nothing Bucky does can stop that. So now they\u2019ll kill for each other, just the way they\u2019ve fought for each other, just the way they\u2019d die for each other. So it is. He grabs Steve by the neck again, and digs his fingers into the short hair at the back of his head, and pulls him closer fiercely, pressing his mouth to his temple and then pushing him away.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your pistol out,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cCome on. You can\u2019t shoot for shit with that, and it\u2019s what you should really be practicing with, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Working with Steve in the war, it turns out, isn\u2019t that much different from working with Steve back home. This is to say that most of their strategizing consists of Bucky saying <em>no</em> while Steve repeats <em>yes</em> until Bucky finally throws up his hands and also says yes, subsequently regretting every single decision he has ever made in his life leading up to that exact moment. Infuriating might be the right word. Even worse is that Steve has decided it\u2019s fun to jump out of exploding buildings. The only real difference from being with Steve back home is that now instead of being saddled with a very small madman Bucky is with a very large one, and it\u2019s this madman that the American people have gone gaga over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>People want pictures, and they want newsreels. Steve flashes his smile for everyone these days, but it\u2019s the wrong smile \u2014 tight around the corners, and a little rueful, like he sees what he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019s making fun of it to himself, this whole insane situation. Sometimes their eyes meet, and the tilt of Steve\u2019s brow changes \u2014 can you believe this shit? \u2014 and it makes Bucky break character, and laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cSergeant, please, if you\u2019d just \u2014 just stand there,\u201d one of the film directors tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re special ops, aren\u2019t you? We got enough smiling guys. Stand there; hold your gun. Just \u2014 brood.\u201d</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t hard to do. And Bucky understands, too: his smile, these days, is killer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><em>They fucked me up, </em>writes Bucky that night, furtive \u2014 before lights out, after his shower. <em>But I don\u2019t ever wanna tell you just how bad.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dermatologists hate him! No, but really: why does Steve Rogers still look thirty?\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>In a recent reevaluation of Dr. Abraham Erksine\u2019s surviving notes, UC Berkeley scientists say that Rogers\u2019 incredibly decreased aging is actually a result of his enhanced healing factor.

You\u2019ve seen me.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>One kid, just a little after I shipped out, not even three months in, he showed up back from leave with the comic books. I laughed in his God damn face. I ain\u2019t proud of it, but I did. I was sore and tired and couldn\u2019t get that smell out of my nose, like car parts on a hot day at the garage. Felt like I was bathing in it. Still do. Blood doesn\u2019t wash out, no matter what they tell you. Not even cold water can do it. So anyway I\u2019m standing there in my boots that are getting holes in them and I\u2019m reeking like the cold mud and shit and whatever the hell else I\u2019d been stepping in, and this green kid settles down by the fire, his eyes too big for his face the way yours used to be, his uniform all clean, and he pulls out this comic book. I about lost it right then. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to yell or cry or sock him one, but it was like there was a huge rushing in my ears and I couldn\u2019t think past the anger. Right then all I could think was of that kid\u2019s body laying on the ground, his eyes staring sightless and bloodshot up at mine. I didn\u2019t want that thought to belong to me. I hated thinking it, but I couldn\u2019t make the image go away. In the end I reigned it in; you\u2019d be proud. All I said was, that mook doesn\u2019t give a shit about you, pal. He\u2019s never fought in a war and he never will.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And Jesus Christ, how\u2019s that for irony?\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>But later I felt like shit and apologized, and even later that kid got his arm blown off by a Kraut hand grenade and was shipped back home. So whatever that says. War stories don\u2019t really have much by way of morals or lessons, but I figured I\u2019d tell it anyway.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I don\u2019t still hate him, or at least not the same way that I used to. How could I? It\u2019s impossible. Got his patch sewn on my left arm and everything. And I\u2019ll wear it, too, until the day I die. I\u2019ll tell you, I should have appreciated that comic book while I had the God damn chance. I was stupid then. The colors in it were so bright and vivid, so much nicer than the gray and green we\u2019ve got here. But when he got carted out of the field he had his comic books in his pack and they shipped home with him. So all that color he brought is back home, now. Which is alright. I figure that\u2019s where those types of happy things belong.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what the worst part is about being out here?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve huffs a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be asleep, Buck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky twists around in the foxhole they\u2019ve dug. There\u2019s no light except for the moon and stars, and it\u2019s almost nice for a second, laying there on the ground; almost like they\u2019re on the camping trip they always joke about going on. But where are we gonna go camping, Buck? Steve will ask, to which Bucky always replies by rote: Central Park, of course! Under a bench, Steve, where else?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not so funny now. It actually wasn't ever funny, except in that strange way that only Steve and Bucky can make each other laugh, because Steve\u2019s sense of humor is twisted and dry, and Bucky loves it, dearly. They could never let anyone else in on that joke, of course: hundreds of people really did camp out in Central, and around other places in the city, when Hoover was in office \u2014 and now, too. Poverty lends to a certain sense of humor. It has to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky punches Steve\u2019s thigh to get his attention. \u201cDon\u2019t wanna sleep,\u201d he says. The truth is he doesn\u2019t need to sleep. Familiar sickish dread curls inside of him, but he focuses on Steve\u2019s grimy moonlit face and shoves the feeling away. \u201cSo: guess.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d Steve asks. He\u2019s only playing at being annoyed now, his eyebrows twitching in that tell-tale way they have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWorst part of being out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, Buck, don\u2019t say the food; that stuff\u2019s gourmet.\u201d Steve never talks like that in front of the guys; it startles Bucky into a laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. Try again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s shirking his watch duties now, resting his back against their dirt wall. His shoulders are too big for them to sit side by side, but he twists around so that they fit anyway, facing Bucky a little more. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Nice soft pillows?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky tries to stamp down his laugh, considering it\u2019s the dead of night and they\u2019re technically in enemy territory. It works, sort of. He knows this conversation isn\u2019t really that funny, and he knows that the jokes are anemic, but it isn\u2019t his fault: he just likes seeing Steve act like himself again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cThird time\u2019s a charm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve heaves a huge put-upon sigh. \u201cHaving to stare at your ugly mug, day in, day out\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky socks him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026And just the other day when I thought something had died and realized it was just the smell of your shirt \u2014 Christ!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>They grapple pretty uselessly, kicking at each other and getting dust everywhere. Steve cries uncle after a second, laughing breathless and quiet, mindful of keeping his voice down. Bucky shoves him, feeling like his grin\u2019s about to split his face in half, and Steve shoves back. \u201cSo what is it?\u201d asks Steve, and the smile is still bright in his blue eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Bucky asks dumbly. Their foxhole is tinier than the single bed they could afford back at home, and their legs press close together. Bucky is distracted. Bucky is always distracted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWorst thing,\u201d Steve reminds him. Bucky falls silent. Steve jostles him with his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s the cold, isn\u2019t it. Know how you feel about the cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d corrects Bucky, softer now. \u201cListen for a second.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Obediently Steve does. After a moment there\u2019s a line of confusion in his brow. He opens his mouth but Bucky answers before he can ask. \u201cQuiet,\u201d Bucky says, and looks into Steve\u2019s eyes, dark and navy in the still of the night. \u201cSo goddamn quiet. Where\u2019s the sounds of the city, huh? Kids breaking bottles in the street. Horns honking until six in the morning. Police sirens. Mangy cats yowling outside. You remember that? It\u2019s hard as hell to sleep without it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was hard as hell to sleep <em>with</em> it,\u201d Steve says. After a moment he murmurs, \u201cI know, though. I know what you mean.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKnew you would,\u201d admits Bucky quietly. Steve\u2019s face is retrospective and gloomy and his lashes cast big shadows along his cheeks when he looks down. Bucky doesn\u2019t like seeing that look, and so he nudges Steve again. \u201cYou know how in the summer \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>hated</em> that,\u201d Steve says, laughing to himself. \u201cNever stopped your goddamn complaining\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky chuckles, quiet. When he was a kid, before the Barneses became completely destitute like the rest of America, his mama would take him and Becca out to her childhood home in Connecticut for one month every summer. There was fresh air, and lots and lots of green grass, and big trees, and flowers all over. Bucky hated it. Bucky despised it. He thought Hartford was absolutely hell on Earth, and at ten could not for the life of him understand why anyone would ever prefer it over life in the city. Every year when he got back he would climb the Rogers\u2019 fire escape and wake Steve up and complain about how inescapably awful it had been. Steve was always terribly sympathetic. \u201cI believe you, Buck,\u201d he would sigh, that mightily heavy sigh he had even at nine, and push Bucky\u2019s hair back from his face. \u201cWe won\u2019t ever go there, I promise.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then at fourteen, when the doctor wanted Steve to move somewhere with clean air, but nobody could afford it. Steve had been apprehensive and angry, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to leave the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ll set you up in Hartford,\u201d Bucky had said, chivalrous, sincere, and Steve, predictably, punched him in the stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They aren\u2019t there, of course \u2014 Connecticut is much nicer than where they are. But still Bucky wouldn\u2019t trade it, in the end. After all, there\u2019s no Steve in Connecticut.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks to Steve, who is smiling quietly and around the eyes. He\u2019s so much happier these days. Bucky doesn\u2019t understand why it is that they can\u2019t ever seem to match up. Steve is sick; Bucky is well. Steve is well, and Bucky is shaking apart at the seams. It\u2019s a terrible and unfair see-saw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky elbows him. He wants to stop thinking about it. \u201cWhat, you hopin\u2019 the Krauts will attack while our guard is down? Keep watch, you lazy lug. Let me get some shut-eye.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve slants him that curious Steve-smile, the one that says he\u2019s got Bucky\u2019s number. He shimmies himself back up to watch out anyway. Neither of them actually sleep a wink the whole night, but as usual they both do a fine job of pretending.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>I saw it \u2014 did you know that? I did. You\u2019ve always been sentimental in stupid ways, can never say it out loud, always got to find a different way to show it. I get it, you know. I do. Hell, I did almost the same thing with your letters before I lost them, keeping them tucked up in my pocket every time I was out in the field. And isn\u2019t that a riot and a half?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Maybe you think about it like a good luck charm. Or maybe you just like to see her pretty face \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t blame you.

If there wasn\u2019t a war on you two would already be living upstate in some real nice brownstone with two dogs and a kid. As it is, when the two of you get out of this alive, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll end up anyway. Don\u2019t be nervous about it. She\u2019ll say yes. She\u2019d say yes if you asked right now. She\u2019d wear a God damn ring from a Cracker Jack box if it was all you had, trust me on that. She\u2019s your forever girl.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>At least those are the things I\u2019m gonna tell you the night before you propose, nervous and pacing and wanting to practice on me. Then again, maybe I won\u2019t live to see it. Sometimes I hope to God I won\u2019t. When it comes right down to it I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be able to do it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve got it in me; I don\u2019t know if I can just stand there while you seal the deal. I\u2019m no good at watching you walk away from me.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You know, after the table, when they took me in to question me about what happened, they gave me an out. They told me they\u2019d discharge me and I could go home \u2014 I\u2019m serious. Due to psychological injury, they said. Do you understand that? I think about it every God damn day of my life. I could have gone home. I could be home right now. I could be sitting in our ugly little shoebox trying to get the radiator to work. I could be at the fish market, or even taking a girl on a date. But God fucking save me, I couldn\u2019t do it. My one dream came true but I didn\u2019t take it because I didn\u2019t want to watch you leave. Not quite yet. I\u2019m selfish and I want to hang on until I can\u2019t anymore.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The God\u2019s honest truth is that I ain\u2019t ever gonna love again. She\u2019s your true north. I know what that means, because you\u2019re mine.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>1944</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Though many aspects of this particular operation still remain classified and a number of details are debatable, it is a fact that the freshly-minted Howling Commandos ran an operation in 1944 that successfully dismantled one of the largest HYDRA bases in Luxembourg, resulting in what is arguably one of the most legendary feats of bravery documented during the Second World War. Because there is no definitive account of what occurred during this mission, this biography can only relay what is definitely known.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It is fact that in September of 1944, the Howling Commandos successfully infiltrated the Luxembourg base. Their mission likely involved gaining intelligence, though the subsequent comic book (see \u201cCaptain America, Issue Twelve\u201d, page 260) echoes an earlier feat, claiming the purpose of the operation was to rescue American prisoners of war. Whatever the mission was, however, it was almost certainly time-sensitive, as many HYDRA bases were rigged with a self-destruct function should they be compromised. It was when the Commandos discovered that detonation was imminent that Barnes asked Rogers how they would escape. Famously, Rogers replied, \u201cBy God\u2019s graces, we will have enough time.\u201d\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>(Cochran, Stacey, and Randall Cross. A Boy From Brooklyn: The Authorized Biography of Captain America. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1950. Print.)\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>They just keep pouring in, two, five, eleven, and their heavy boots thunk and screech across the floor. All Bucky can think to do is try to hold them off best he can so they can\u2019t reach the rest of the team, who he hopes to God is finishing the mission. After two deafening and eternal minutes Bucky finally runs out of ammo. He ducks behind the bullet-riddled conference table of the situation room and draws his Colt. When he\u2019s upright again he fires one magazine into the increasing fray before a man is on him from behind while he reloads. Bucky twists away and dives for the soldier\u2019s gun. The soldier might have the advantage of armor but Bucky is stronger and faster, and they go down together from the force of his body. They grapple but the soldier doesn\u2019t stand a chance. With a curious silence in his head Bucky finally gets the loaded pistol, pins the other man with his knees, and shoots him three times in the head through his black mask. He drops the HYDRA gun \u2014 it\u2019s empty \u2014 and reloads his own, staying low. The sightless goggles of the soldier\u2019s mask stare up at him while he picks them off before they can get through the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fired four bullets and has four more left when there are shots fired from the other side. The soldiers start dropping like flies and Dernier rounds the corner, followed closely by Steve and Falsworth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the HYDRA in the room is taken care of quickly, and when Morita finally shoots the last operative\u2019s brains out he spits on the body. Steve jogs over to Bucky. There\u2019s a tear in his cowl where a cut bleeds high on his cheek. Bucky doesn\u2019t like the look on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s rigged to blow,\u201d Steve pants, loud enough for the other guys, licking wounds and checking cartridges, to hear. \u201cWe gotta get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky remembers the labyrinthine hallways that led him to this room and stops short. \u201cYou think we got enough time?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Steve sucks in a breath. \u201cI sure goddamn hope so.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course Bucky didn\u2019t count his turns, and he has a split-second of panic before he realizes that Steve did. So he falls behind, on Steve\u2019s left, and keeps his pistol at the ready. Their footsteps thunder and echo in the little space as they run, taking a right, a left, another right. Bucky wonders how much time they\u2019ve got left and pushes harder. He prays that none of the doors swing open and start spilling out Frankenstein\u2019s monsters. It sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They round another corner, and thank God for Steve Rogers, because there in front of them is the exit door, hanging open. They file through and run breakneck away from the base. Steve puts on the speed and so does Bucky, somehow keeping pace with him. The other guys aren\u2019t far behind, on their six as always, and the thick line of trees grows closer and closer until finally they\u2019re out of the clearing and into the forest. The base detonates from the inside. There\u2019s a moment of perfect silence, and then a deafening, sudden crackle. One thunderous boom and debris starts to fly. Like a bullet-riddled umbrella Steve raises his shield instinctively to protect their heads. Bucky sees the other Commandos taking cover from the steel and wood raining from the sky. But after a moment, like all things, it stops: Steve lowers the shield and gives Bucky a hand up. The rest of the team, battered but whole, starts picking their way over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve turns to Bucky with confusion on his face. \u201cBuck,\u201d he says, \u201cListen, I found \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>It happens fast. There\u2019s a flash of silver, and Bucky sees blood and hears Dernier shout, and before he knows what he\u2019s doing he has his gun drawn. A dull reflection in the dim light of the forest catches his eye \u2014 goggles \u2014 and Bucky spins, firing. The soldier, just a lone one, rushes him. Bucky fires right into his chest, but he\u2019s in something bulletproof and won\u2019t go down. Bucky keeps squeezing the trigger. It clicks twice before he realizes he\u2019s out of ammo, and by then the soldier is on him, and they hit the ground hard enough to knock all the air from Bucky\u2019s lungs. They roll in the mud and finally Bucky ends up on top, pinning his legs. The soldier\u2019s fists start flying; some of the blows connect. Bucky can hear his grunting noises from behind the mask. He flails and twists and then he\u2019s got a solid grasp on Bucky\u2019s head. Two gloved thumbs press high into Bucky\u2019s cheekbones and he realizes his eyes are about to be gouged out. He whips the soldier across the head with his empty Colt. It\u2019s enough pain through the thick helmet, or maybe just enough of a surprise, that the soldier\u2019s grip on Bucky\u2019s skull loosens. In that split second of opportunity Bucky tears off the mask. He flips his hold on his pistol so that he\u2019s got it by the barrel. The man underneath him has a plain and entirely unremarkable face. His eyes go wide before Bucky brings the grip down on him. Bucky hits him again and again. There\u2019s a crack and then a sudden give; the soldier\u2019s cheek has broken. He makes a strangled and high noise of pain. All the blood means Bucky\u2019s hand has gone slick. Bucky hits him until he\u2019s sure he won\u2019t be getting up again. The man\u2019s nose is collapsed, and his eye sockets are misshapen. Finally his face is gone entirely and Bucky can feel blood on his neck. The second he knows the soldier is dead Bucky is on his feet. Not far away the team is hunched down. Bucky runs to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he breathes. He knocks Dugan and Falsworth out of the way when he scrambles to kneel down. Morita has his field med kit out and Jones\u2019 hand is pushed tight against Steve\u2019s neck. Steve\u2019s helmet has been discarded and his head is lolling to the side. His eyelashes flutter, like a drunk\u2019s: wide, slitted, wide. It takes Bucky a long moment of staring to understand. There is a knife in Steve\u2019s throat. There\u2019s that smell, like car parts in the summer. The smell is blood. Steve is bleeding to death under Jones\u2019 hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch out for others,\u201d Bucky barks to the team. Dugan and Falsworth stand, snapped out of their mute terror; Dernier stays, ready to lend a hand. But all Bucky is really aware of is all the blood staining Steve\u2019s uniform, visible on Jones\u2019 wrist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, Jesus fucking Christ,\u201d repeats Bucky. He has no idea what to do with his hands and impotently they flutter near Steve\u2019s face. He hopes to God that he\u2019s still in there. He doesn\u2019t mean to shout but it happens anyway. His voice cracks when it does. \u201cSteve? <em>Steve!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cShut up; don\u2019t draw attention. He\u2019s lost a whole lot of blood,\u201d Morita says. He\u2019s moving quick, digging out a triangular bandage and shoving the fabric at Jones to hold. \u201cWe need medical evac.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare.\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice is cracking and low. He hears it, distantly. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare, look at me, you <em>look at me,</em> Steve, <em>Stevie</em> \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jones says, \u201cThere\u2019s no medical evac this deep in enemy territory.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Morita says, flinty. \u201cSwitch out the bandage for your hand as quick as you can. We need to get him up and moving, back to camp. We got no idea how safe it is here and there isn\u2019t a needle or floss in my field kit.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jones holds his breath and does as he\u2019s told. It\u2019s a lot of blood. It\u2019s a whole lot of blood. Jones\u2019 eyes meet Morita\u2019s; Jones\u2019 eyes are scared. \u201cJim, there\u2019s no goddamn way we can carry him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s eyes open, just a little. \u201c\u2026happened?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStabbed in the neck, Captain,\u201d Morita replies, with a medic\u2019s special brand of grim cheer. \u201cJust another Tuesday, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTuesday,\u201d Steve mumbles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d Morita instructs, and then to Jones, \u201cDon\u2019t got a choice, do we? Keep the pressure on the wound and we\u2019ll get him up slowly. The guys are on our six.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWe can\u2019t act like we got time,\u201d Bucky snaps.</p>\n<p>Morita fixes him with a look that\u2019s steely. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, like his faith is going to carry them right through the forest and hold off every HYDRA soldier in thirty miles besides. \u201cYes, we can.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Buck?\u201d Steve asks. He tries to move his head to find the source of Bucky\u2019s voice. He hisses abruptly in pain instead and his eyes squeeze shut.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit tryin\u2019 that,\u201d says Bucky hoarsely. He puts his hand on Steve\u2019s face so he\u2019ll have a point of reference. He feels sick and disoriented when he leaves blood from the man he killed in Steve\u2019s flaxen hair. \u201cShut up, don\u2019t talk; you\u2019re makin\u2019 it worse.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan walk,\u201d Steve slurs, after a second. There\u2019s a frown tugging down his mouth when he tries to sit up. But he does it. Morita looks at Jones, who looks at Dernier, who looks at Bucky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Bucky says, realizing that none of them are going to say it first, because no one wants to give an order that might end up killing their captain. \u201cSteve? <em>Hey</em>, Rogers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve hums. He smells like gunpowder and blood. This isn\u2019t a back alley, Steve, Bucky thinks, and he hears it in the voice of a boy who\u2019s dead. This isn\u2019t a back alley. This is war.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, you gotta get up, you big lug,\u201d says Bucky out loud, his voice cracking. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get up.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s brow furrows, but his eyes have shut again. \u201cM\u2019late for class?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, buddy, yeah, you\u2019re late to class,\u201d Bucky agrees, but he\u2019s all cold inside. The fact that Steve is disoriented enough to think it's 1940 should be tipping Bucky over into a whole new wave of panic, but it doesn\u2019t: Steve is bleeding out, and as a result he\u2019s somehow numb to anything else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jones and Dernier exchange a look. \u201cUp, get up,\u201d Bucky urges. It\u2019s a battle and a half to get Steve on his knees and then Bucky says, \u201cJones \u2014\u201c and together they haul Steve to his feet; Bucky, by some miracle, managing to bear his weight. For a second he sways where he stands and Bucky thinks they\u2019re going to topple over. But Steve is Steve and Steve is stubborn; Steve is miraculous; Steve didn\u2019t die in \u201926, or \u201934, or \u201938, and he\u2019s not going to die now. Steve isn\u2019t going to die now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember walking?\u201d Bucky asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve mumbles incoherently before he manages, with a real amount of vehemence for someone bleeding so heavily: \u201c\u2026M\u2019no\u2026idiot, Barnes.\u201d</p>\n<p>A laugh launches out of Bucky\u2019s throat. \u201cCoulda fooled me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Cap, just a few steps,\u201d Morita says. Steve and Bucky and Jones, in some especially bloody five-legged race, manage to start walking. Bucky yells out a command. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is. He doesn\u2019t remember. He digs his fingers into Steve\u2019s ribs. They move slowly in a formation that reminds Bucky of penguins he read about once in school, all huddled around the smallest and weakest in the dead of winter to keep them warm. This, at least, Bucky is used to. He\u2019s good at keeping Steve warm. He repeats this to himself. If there\u2019s one thing he\u2019s good at, it\u2019s keeping Steve warm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep him conscious,\u201d Morita directs, and then, \u201cThank fuck we didn\u2019t settle down fifteen miles away.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky wracks his brain. He can\u2019t think of anything past the white noise of terror, and so he decides instead to do what he does best: he starts telling a story. \u201cHey, Steve. Remember that cake your ma used to make? What was it called?\u201d</p>\n<p>Their pace is painfully slow; inside Bucky\u2019s spine is a terrified itch that is telling him to grab Steve and run. Instead he watches their feet as they stumble. Steve\u2019s knees keep giving out on him. \u201cApple,\u201d Steve responds, after a second. He\u2019s breathing heavy and Bucky instinctively listens for a rattle or wheeze. At least there isn\u2019t one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, apple,\u201d Bucky agrees. \u201cAnd remember when the war hit, and we couldn\u2019t afford apples, and one day I stole a couple from Mazzello\u2019s and you caught me and made me walk all the way back and wash his dishes for a week?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve makes an affirmative sound. From his left Jones attempts a smile. \u201cThis story got a point, Sarge?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Bucky replies. \u201cThe point is \u2014 Stevie, you listening? The point is, Steve\u2019s a goddamn terrible cook; burns boiling water. But he better not plan on bleeding out, because he\u2019s the only person alive who knows his ma\u2019s secret ingredient, and I ain\u2019t dying without having tasted that cake one last time.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve huffs what might be a laugh. And thank God \u2014 Bucky wants to fall to his knees and cry \u2014 there\u2019s one of their tents, finally visible, mercifully undiscovered by the enemy. They must get settled; Bucky isn\u2019t too aware of it. He tries to keep Steve\u2019s eyes open. He says his name again and again. He murmurs things. Look at me. Look at me. Steve, we\u2019re fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood news is, it probably won\u2019t get infected,\u201d Morita is saying, digging one-handed in his kit. There\u2019s a wry tilt to his mouth. \u201cYou know what would be real goddamn helpful, though? If anyone had bothered to tell me exactly what it was the Army juiced him up with.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>None of the Commandos talk about it \u2014 none of them, technically, are supposed to know at all \u2014 but there\u2019s no room for lying when Steve\u2019s still bleeding under Morita\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow about as much as you do,\u201d Bucky confesses. \u201cHe\u2019s fast. Strong. Has a way of healing quick. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nMorita looks like he figured as much. \u201cThread me a needle,\u201d he instructs. With Steve propped precariously up on him Bucky does as he\u2019s told and hands it over. Morita\u2019s mouth goes tight. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna bleed like hell, Sarge,\u201d he warns. \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna work fast. Hold his head. Keep him still.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bucky says quietly to Steve. He makes a little sound. \u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky says, even though he doesn\u2019t mean to. His throat is tight, and his vision is blurring. He blinks hard. It hurts so bad. Don\u2019t do that, he wants to say. He wants to say: you\u2019re breaking my heart. Steve smells like sweat and fear. It\u2019s a unique war-smell. He\u2019s so pale, and Bucky is so afraid. Morita unscrews a little bottle of iodine with his teeth and balances it on the ground, dipping the needle into it. Bucky tips Steve\u2019s head against his shoulder and he makes another noise. Bucky tightens his hand and just like that Morita steels himself, removes the bandage, and starts in.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t lie: there is a lot of blood. Bucky can\u2019t stop looking. \u201cYou\u2019re alright,\u201d he says to Steve, though he doesn\u2019t really hear himself. \u201cYou\u2019re alright.\u201d Bucky has no idea how Morita can even see the wound, but sure enough he\u2019s holding the skin together in one hand and sewing it up with the other. He has to stop and tie a knot one-handed after each stitch. It\u2019s messy and it\u2019s ugly. Steve\u2019s hands clench into fists, and five of his fingers dig in to Bucky\u2019s thigh. Bucky sees sweat on his brow. Bucky isn\u2019t even sure what he\u2019s saying. \u201cSorry, almost done \u2014 he\u2019s almost done, Steve, huh? Not so bad, he\u2019s almost done.\u201d Don\u2019t leave; don\u2019t leave. I\u2019d do anything to make you stay. He talks about other things. About everything and nothing. He tells stories and cracks pale and unfunny jokes. It reminds him of city winters, and Steve laid up sick in bed, and lighting candles at church. Steve\u2019s blunt nails tear through Bucky\u2019s pants and draw five pinpricks of blood in his leg, and the mud is cold beneath them. \u201cI got you; I got you,\u201d Bucky repeats, and again, \u201cI got you, m\u2019here, nothin\u2019 bad\u2019s gonna happen, not while I\u2019m here,\u201d and he presses his nose into Steve\u2019s hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And sure enough, it\u2019s over. Bucky doesn\u2019t realize how hard his heart was pounding until the second that Morita ties off the last suture and reaches for the iodine again. He pours it over the wound and it washes away most of the blood, and Steve makes a terrible noise while he does it, his legs twitching. But he\u2019s alive. The word pounds through Bucky with his blood. He knows his eyes are still huge and panicked in his face, and he\u2019s aware that he\u2019s shaking all over, very finely. Alive, alive, alive. Morita reaches up and checks Steve\u2019s pulse, and after a moment of listening his eyes find Bucky\u2019s, and he nods.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>You scare the hell out of me. Every hour of every God damn day. You scare me to fucking death.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have a theory, a theory about war, and it works like this \u2014 all of us, whether we enlisted or hit the lottery, we tell ourselves stories about why we\u2019re out here. Some guys who get the draft say it\u2019s God\u2019s plan for them, and some guys who enlist say they\u2019re doin it for Uncle Sam or their sweethearts or their mamas, or maybe even their shellshocked daddies.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I didn\u2019t come to war for you and I didn\u2019t fight to keep it away. The way I got out here was cowardly. But the more I fought the more I told myself my story. It\u2019s so much easier when you\u2019re telling yourself a story. Because the truth is that we\u2019re not here for God or for our nation or even for our families or our sweethearts. Maybe we think so at first or we convince ourselves afterwards, which is easy enough to do when you\u2019re humping through the muck or trying not to catch hypothermia in the forest. In the field it\u2019s a different story. Suddenly all the pretty pictures you\u2019ve painted fade away and all that\u2019s left is the ugly gore and the sweat. It turns out that there\u2019s not one God damn thing that\u2019s glorious about death. You\u2019re not out here for them. You\u2019re out here because that\u2019s just the way the chips fell.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I told you, you heard me: I told you never to follow me into Hell. Now I\u2019m not vain enough to think that\u2019s why you\u2019re out here now \u2014 if there\u2019s any person in what\u2019s left of this God forsaken planet who\u2019s part of a bigger picture, it\u2019d be you. But I\u2019ll keep saying it until it sticks. You got nothing to prove. I\u2019m not worth much, I damn well know that, but I\u2019ll ask you anyway: Stay for me. If you leave me alone in this world I\u2019ll turn into something terrible. I\u2019ll turn into the nasty creature that\u2019s growing inside me. This war, it\u2019ll swallow me whole.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>By the time Steve is back on his feet they\u2019ve evacuated to base. He acts fine but he sleeps for hours and hours at a time. Bucky remembers that, from before. Steve was always tired. And Bucky would let himself in after work with the key under the rock, and on the stove their paltry dinner would be burning, and there was Steve, always Steve: passed out on the couch, his face stuffed into the ratty cushions, his skinny toes sticking out from underneath the blanket. He was perennially confusing Bucky\u2019s sweaters with his own, God knows how, and he would wear it, the green one, the one that slipped off his shoulder, when he got too cold. He fell asleep in that one a lot. And Bucky would toe his shoes off, and take the broth off the stove\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Morita tells him, picking at his beans. The mess hall is mostly empty, and Steve has been in bed already for an hour. \u201cSleep helps the body heal. The more he sleeps the better he\u2019ll get.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone else would\u2019ve been dead in two minutes flat,\u201d Bucky says, on edge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morita heaves a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d he replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky is ravenous nearly all the time \u2014 he has been since Austria \u2014\u00a0 and he forces himself to eat because he has to, not because he wants it. At least the silence is too exhausted to be uncomfortable. Belatedly Bucky realizes that he\u2019s never actually been alone with Morita before. Bucky knows two things about Jim Morita: he lived in Fresno, and he hoards his D-rations not for emergencies but instead for days when morale is low. Bucky wants badly to start a conversation, but for the maybe first time in his life he doesn\u2019t know how. He could ask about what growing up out on the west coast was like, if palm trees really are as big as they look in the pictures \u2014 if he put up with a lot of shit in his neighborhood; how much worse it must have been for him after Pearl Harbor. And maybe once Bucky could have started that conversation, and he could have turned on a smile and drawn the real Jim out; he even thinks of the joke he would open with, something about their shared first name. But now he has no idea how to do that, or how to be that person. So instead Bucky eats his food in silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really took that motherfucker down,\u201d Morita says, after a second. Bucky looks up, confused. There\u2019s a strange and wary smile at the corner of Morita\u2019s mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anyone so angry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky flounders but keeps his expression blank, unsure of how to answer. Morita doesn\u2019t seem to be the kind to gloat about killing Nazis, and there is something more in his sure gaze than victory. In fact there isn\u2019t a hint of victory at all.</p>\n<p>After a pause Morita sighs and shifts and finally he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to take this at all the wrong way, and God knows you\u2019ve got the right to hit me silly if you do \u2014 but are you alright, Sarge?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I not seem alright?\u201d Then Bucky remembers that he\u2019s trying to get to know this guy better. He thinks of what he would have done before, and forcibly he lowers his hackles. \u201cBecause I\u2019m doin\u2019 fine, Morita. Good as anyone else, which is to say that I\u2019m \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTired as hell, cold as balls?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky is surprised enough that he grins. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got at least a week of R&amp;R, if the rumor\u2019s right. Guess Phillips will tell us tomorrow either way.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky hasn\u2019t heard anything about that, and truthfully it didn\u2019t even cross his mind once while he generally made a nuisance of himself in medical. He knows that when he\u2019s down there, staring over Steve and halfheartedly flirting with the nurses, that he\u2019s more hindrance than help. But he doesn\u2019t know how to stop himself from doing it. He doesn\u2019t know how to stop himself from doing a lot of things these days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morita is continuing on their conversation deftly even though Bucky is probably brooding so loudly they can hear it in munitions. \u201cSpeaking of Phillips, I should probably go see if I can talk to him before lights out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d asks Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving to carry Cap all the way back to our camp while he was bleeding like that isn\u2019t something that we can afford to do again. I\u2019m putting in a request for a more complete field med kit, for us and other commando units. I understand not needing a needle or floss in the trenches, but out here, on the kind of ops we take, we don\u2019t always have the luxury of a nearby med wing. Like you said, if any one of us would have taken that wound, we would\u2019ve been dead in minutes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s smart,\u201d says Bucky, and means it. He thinks of Steve raising hell just to allow Morita and Jones to fight with them, and suddenly he\u2019s worried. \u201cYou, uh \u2014 you gonna go alone?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morita seems to study him for a second. And then he says, quietly enough that Bucky feels the immense weight of his trust: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t usually, you understand? But it was life or death out there. And I think that\u2026\u201d He frowns, unwilling to finish, but Bucky understands it now. Because it\u2019s about Steve, who\u2019s doubtlessly the only really invaluable one on their team, Morita is hoping that the brass will overlook the fact that he\u2019s Japanese in heritage and fighting side-by-side with white guys, sort of illegally, because they can\u2019t afford to lose Captain America.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morita\u2019s going to have to play it really well, Bucky thinks, so that he doesn\u2019t come off like he\u2019s saying that the Army itself fucked up. Not even Steve\u2019s pigheaded insistence could keep them from booting Morita out then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, let me talk to him,\u201d Bucky offers. \u201cI\u2019ll let him know what happened in the field. Hell, they\u2019ve been getting on my ass to submit a report anyway; I\u2019ll just bring it up then.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morita looks totally dumbstruck. \u201cSarge \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t offer if I didn\u2019t wanna,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn good soldier, Morita. Steve wouldn\u2019t want to risk you over a med kit, and for that matter I don\u2019t want to, either.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Morita says. He grins. \u201cWell, damn. Alright. I can\u2019t turn that down. Thanks, Sergeant Barnes. Really.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky nods. They shake on it. \u201cIs Dugan giving you shit?\u201d he asks, before he can talk himself out of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDugan\u2019s on the level.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky takes that for what it is, and then says, \u201cYou did \u2014\u201d and it takes him by surprise. He has to gather himself before he finishes. He clears his throat and lets go of Morita\u2019s hand. He feels like he\u2019s spoken out of turn. \u201cYou did good.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morita shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was touch and go. Field medicine\u2019s more of an art than a science. Half luck, half accident. Anyone else \u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d says Bucky, quiet and purposeful. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their eyes meet. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Jim Morita tells him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>A full luxurious week of leave in London is the reward they get for almost getting Steve killed in the field. They\u2019re in the city all of two hours, setting up shop in the rickety brown apartment complex that has been appropriated for the war effort, when Bucky finally gets some good news. Naturally he uses this opportunity to climb the fire escape just like old times, and sneaks in through Steve\u2019s window.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t hear Bucky come in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, trouble,\u201d he says, and Steve jumps about thirty feet at the desk and slams his sketchbook shut. Bucky starts cackling, and Steve looks ready to throw the table at him. \u201cShit, Stevie, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat you got in there, huh? Naked ladies?\u201d He makes like he\u2019s going to grab for it and Steve scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrawn worse,\u201d he says. \u201cYou sat in on that figures class. And \u2014 God, what, three years ago, when \u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve laughs, remembering. \u201cThat was a lot of money. I think that was the most money I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you only had to draw a bunch of girls in their underthings, I know, what a burden that must have been.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ankle ain\u2019t right,\u201d Steve says, in the discerning voice of his employer, a man who Bucky never met but was suspicious of for the entire duration of Steve\u2019s employment. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Re-e-e-a-l </em>slim,\u201d Bucky chimes in, and it makes Steve laugh. \u201cGod damn, that guy. Creepy as hell.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you getting settled into your room?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPal, I own one duffle bag and a pair of shoes, and those I\u2019m wearing,\u201d Bucky says. He leans a hip against the old desk and then he procures the pamphlet he snatched from the reception bulletin board today. He waves it in front of Steve. \u201cLook. Thought we could relive your chorus girl glory days.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve squints while he reads it, muscle memory, and then rolls his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you got a report to write?\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cFinished it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBuck \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have an excuse,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cWe\u2019re on leave, you\u2019re itching to get out, and girls will be falling all over themselves to get you on the dance floor. C\u2019mon.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA big dance hall filled up with a million people, with no air, and Dugan sneaking in alcohol? Bucky, I\u2019m sorry; it just doesn\u2019t sound like my idea of a good time.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky sighs. \u201cThis is the first and maybe the only leave we\u2019ll ever get. I can\u2019t let you pass up the opportunity, Steve. That\u2019s just sad. We\u2019ll dance with the girls. It\u2019ll be <em>fun.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>That frown is between Steve\u2019s eyebrows and he says, uncomfortably, \u201cBucky, I don\u2019t know about dancing with girls. I\u2019m\u2026you know, I don\u2019t want to\u2026do anything that might, might not be right.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes Bucky a second, but he puts it together fast. \u201cAgent Carter,\u201d he realizes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve is red. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d he tries; but it is what he\u2019s saying, and he can never lie to Bucky anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, Christ, thinks Bucky. Here it is. He knew he\u2019d have to make this speech eventually. Aw, Steve, he\u2019s supposed to say. She\u2019ll say yes. She\u2019d say yes if you asked right now. She\u2019d marry you if you proposed with a ring from a Cracker Jack box. She\u2019s your forever girl, Steve, Bucky tries to get out. She\u2019s your forever girl. But it turns to ash in his throat and after working his mouth uselessly for a second he finally snaps it shut. Steve doesn\u2019t notice. He\u2019s frowning, and looking down at the table. Something else is on his mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind,\u201d Bucky finally manages, hugely inadequate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve looks at him. \u201cBuck,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was something \u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bucky asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the base,\u201d Steve replies. Bucky remembers now how Steve turned to him, just before he was hit, and how he was going to say something, but then it was impossible. Steve is still looking at him. \u201cI saw \u2014 there was this document, I guess it \u2014\u201c and then he shakes his head. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was it? Hell, now you <em>have</em> to tell me; I\u2019m curious,\u201d Bucky says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve shakes his head. \u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cNever mind me. I probably saw it wrong anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky decides to let it go. He shoves at Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cListen,\u201d he says, \u201cIt\u2019s a <em>dance, </em>not a wedding ring. Besides, none of the USO girls are like that. They\u2019re all very proper, hand-picked from church congregations. You\u2019ll see. And look, I\u2019ll be good: I won\u2019t even make you get out there. All you gotta do is tag along and drink some punch and sulk along the wall.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve frowns mightily. \u201cI won\u2019t sulk,\u201d he complains. \u201cI <em>don\u2019t</em> sulk.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bucky agrees. He ruffles Steve\u2019s hair and Steve bats back ineffectively. \u201cAbout as sweet as vinegar, you are. And so <em>dramatic</em>. Jesus. You auditioning for Broadway, sunshine?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLord\u2019s name,\u201d Steve admonishes, just to be contrary, and finally smacks his hand away. He heaves a sigh. \u201cFine. <em>Fine</em>, I\u2019ll come.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, was that so hard? You better be ready by 1700 sharp, Cap.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to know?\u201d asks Steve suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMa\u2019s ingredient. In the cake.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky can\u2019t believe Steve remembers that. He was in and out of consciousness for that whole day. Bucky looks at him for a long minute, and then he decides, quietly: \u201cNo way, Steve. Hold onto it for me, until after the war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The USO gig is \u2014 and Steve is smug about this \u2014 positively terrible. All the other soldiers are either hostile or greenly starstruck, and Steve has to put on that godawful fake voice he uses. But the unit only has to endure for half an hour, because then Bucky meets a beautiful girl named Laurie. She wears bright red lipstick and has her nails painted to match, and when she offers to show them the real nightlife in London Dugan almost trips over himself saying yes, so it\u2019s a yes, and finally they spill out of the stuffy dance hall and into the muggy night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pub they all end up in is packed and sweaty and downtrodden. The sticky floorboards creak, and it smells like spilled beer. The band is so loud that Bucky feels the beat vibrating in his chest, and he belatedly realizes he hasn\u2019t heard music like this, real music, hot jazz, in two years now at least. Bucky loves it, immediately. So he turns to Laurie with her pretty blue skirt and her curled pale hair, and asks, \u201cMay I?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do it a little differently here,\u201d Laurie says to him. Bucky\u2019s heart is six sizes too big because of the music and the laughter and all the cigarette smoke. He winks at her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly Bucky catches on fast, and from there, they\u2019re off: Laurie knows how to Lindy, and she knows how to do a lot of other things, too. She\u2019s good \u2014 she\u2019s amazing. Bucky takes off his jacket and loses his hat. He snaps off his suspenders and loosens his tie. The music is fast. Her smile is bright, and she yelps and laughs when he swings her over his shoulder. She never misses a beat. They raise the dust on the floorboards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky doesn\u2019t know how long it lasts, and he doesn\u2019t care. Finally a slow song comes on, and Laurie\u2019s hair is slipping a little from its two victory rolls, and her fingers are slim and strong on his shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBuy me a drink,\u201d she says to him, \u201cI have gentleman admirers to tend to.\u201d And she does \u2014 when she pulls out a cigarette three men scramble over themselves to get her a light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhiskey?\u201d Bucky asks, over her laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Commandos, true to their name, raise a howling ruckus when Bucky passes by their table on his way back from the bar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMan,\u201d Jones laughs, \u201cI had no idea you could dance that way, Sarge.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still offended you\u2019re the only one who managed to snag a USO girl,\u201d Falsworth says. \u201cI\u2019m a <em>native</em>, Barnes, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky could charm Mussolini into signing a peace treaty,\u201d says Steve, and the guys roar with laughter. Bucky slaps him on the back, and squeezes his shoulder. He studies him for a second, and Steve gives him a shove. He\u2019s smiling. He wants Bucky to have a good time. That\u2019s always enough for Bucky, and so he leaves to find Laurie again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the lady,\u201d he says, presenting her drink. She smiles up at him, and her nose wrinkles when she does. She gives him the rest of her cigarette, and it thrills him to put his mouth where her lipstick stains are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By last call Steve is gone, and the other boys have found themselves girls or friends or other places for the night. The band strikes up their final sad tune. The piano is meandering and pretty and the trumpets are soft.<em> In all the old familiar places</em>, their singer hums. <em>I\u2019ll be seeing you; I\u2019ll be seeing you\u2026I\u2019ll be looking at the moon, but I\u2019ll be seeing\u2026</em></p>\n<p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Laurie asks, and he says yes; he wants to walk her home, and this song is too sad to dance to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s lucky Bucky is with a local: London is in a blackout. The city hopes to be quiet and unassuming at night, and very still, and it holds its breath \u2014 that way, the Luftwaffe might not see it. It reminds Bucky of hide and seek with Becca when they were little. There isn\u2019t a single light on the street other than the moon and the occasional car. A steady drizzle falls around them. Bucky wants to offer Laurie his jacket, but she has her own.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t want that dance,\u201d Laurie says, her small hand tucked into the crook of his arm again, companionably. She scuffs her feet while she says this. \u201cI don\u2019t like sad songs, is all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho does?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome people,\u201d Laurie says. \u201cDon\u2019t you know anyone who likes sad songs?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky admits, because Steve does. Artist type.</p>\n<p>Laurie kisses him brashly outside of her building. Her lipstick tastes waxy and gets all over his mouth. He hasn\u2019t kissed a girl in a while. He can\u2019t remember the last time he kissed anyone. And so he presses her against the cold brick wall, and he kisses her again and again. Finally he pulls away. Her lipstick is smudged and gone in places. Her eyes are big and brown. Bucky loops his index finger in one of her flyaway yellow curls and gives it a tug. It makes her smile and he kisses her again before letting up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me for not inviting you in,\u201d Laurie says, hushed, but she still has a curious smile tilting her mouth. She\u2019s sad around the eyes, the same way everyone is now. Up close her mascara seems singed and ashy, just like the rest of her city. \u201cI don\u2019t like getting attached to soldiers, you understand. The turnover rate for your profession is rather high.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t apologize,\u201d Bucky replies, and his voice is quiet, too. \u201cIt\u2019s true, we drop like flies. I wasn\u2019t even really thinking about it, anyhow. It was nice just to dance.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Laurie keeps smiling her little smile at him, wistful. \u201cYou know what\u2019s funny, Sarge? I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re lying. Besides, you must have a sweetheart at a home. I wouldn\u2019t want to make her jealous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky shrugs. \u201cNope. But how do I know you don\u2019t got someone too? Dame like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Laurie replies, \u201cThe turnover rate for your profession is high.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Bucky can stumble his way through a response to that, she reaches up then and brushes her fingers high on his cheekbone. \u201cI was rather expecting the mask,\u201d she says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, in the comic books.\u201d Laurie\u2019s red fingers still rest feather-light on his face. They\u2019re cold. \u201cWe have them here, too. Bucky Barnes, Captain America\u2019s right-hand man. You have a mask on in them.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky had no idea. \u201cSounds like it would make seeing the enemy out of my scope kind of difficult, if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know what I do now, for a living?\u201d asks Laurie. \u201cI spend all day in the factory: I make bombs. It\u2019s not as though I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re out there using them for.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>She kisses him again, this time on the cheek. \u201cI had a good night, Sergeant Barnes,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI do like you. It\u2019s good you don\u2019t wear the mask. You have beautiful eyes. You have the eyes of an honest man.\u201d Bucky is enthralled. His throat is closing up. She\u2019s so beautiful, and so sad; Bucky doesn\u2019t even know her last name, and he will never see her again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJames Barnes,\u201d Laurie says, in a whisper, and her smile is still at the corner of her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t lie this time. Your eyes give you away. Who were you dancing with tonight? Do you miss her very much?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss her all the time,\u201d Bucky confesses, though he can barely speak. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour chin is the same.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky kisses her, hard and sudden and viciously hungry, and she bites his lip when he pulls away. They look at each other. \u201cGoodnight, James,\u201d Laurie tells him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight, Laurie,\u201d Bucky says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She gives him one last pretty smile and then her blue skirt swishes and then she\u2019s gone, into the door, and Bucky is left standing out in the drizzle with empty hands. He loiters for a second, wishing for a smoke, but finally just stuffs his hands in his coat pockets and starts to wander. He doesn\u2019t know where he is, but he paid attention on the the walk over here, and so he figures he\u2019ll find his way back eventually. Despite all that he drank he isn\u2019t feeling a buzz. He chalks it up to how cold the air is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a while of walking Bucky finds that he misses the weight of his rifle and his pack now that he isn\u2019t dancing. The steady light rain begins to slide down the back of his collar. This city is nothing like his own; it\u2019s too quiet, for one, and for another the buildings are tall but not quite tall enough, and they\u2019re so old, with big intricate carvings all over them. But if he concentrates hard it smells almost the same, and he likes that about it; he likes that about it just fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>If I close my eyes I can pretend I\u2019m back home, except there\u2019s maybe not so many horns honking. It\u2019s better than being on the front, though. Hell of a lot better than that.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Remember on the real hot days when we used to dangle our legs off the dock? At around four o\u2019clock the hot dog stand shaded us until sundown. I was peeled and blistered and burned from working all day out in the sun anyway, but I didn\u2019t want to go to the apartment because it wasn\u2019t often you\u2019d get out. You were always so careful when you brought your sketchbook for drawing, making sure not to drop it in, but everything you drew those days ended up getting sprayed a little by the waves anyway. There must be a million drawings of me and the landscape there that\u2019s smudged in tiny circles the shape of the water droplets.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I remember one year, when we first got a place, the kid in the apartment below us \u2014 really just a kid \u2014 he died in the night from the fever that was taking everyone in the neighborhood. And you were so damn upset, all hunched over, red around the eyes. I slung my arm around you and said a bunch of bullshit nonsense about how it was fine and at least he didn\u2019t hurt anymore. But then I put my face in your hair and thanked God it was him and not you. I thought, if He had to take someone, at least it wasn\u2019t you. It was the worst thing I ever thought but it\u2019s true.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tell you a secret? One month out a guy got hurt bad in a shelling. Reminded me of that sick kid downstairs, the same hair, you remember \u2014 curly? Just like then there wasn\u2019t nothing I could have done to help him. His belly looked like Swiss cheese from all the shrapnel. Fell down next to me. There was no saving him, and he was staring right at me \u2014 it\u2019s not like I could leave him there, not when he was looking like that. He said please, and so I shot him in the face. I was glad when he was done wheezing and gasping. I was so damn glad: I didn\u2019t have to listen to it anymore. So maybe that\u2019s the worst thing I ever thought, now that I remember it.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Water\u2019s different here. It mists off the Thames, and by night I half expect the air to freeze while I try to walk through it. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d dip my feet in, or want you to. And what\u2019s there to draw? Can\u2019t even see Big Ben or any of that from where we are. Everything\u2019s so gray, I miss the big red burns I\u2019d get that made me have to sleep on my belly for weeks on end. I don\u2019t think you could ever really stay out long enough to get a burn that way but I remember that your nose would get it bad and turn all red and peel a little on the bridge of it. I thought that was funny as hell. Sweet. I don\u2019t know why, but it was. Bet you don\u2019t even burn now. That\u2019s a good thing, I keep telling myself. In this world of bad things that\u2019s one really good thing.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIntel tells us that there\u2019s a base in Poland,\u201d Commander Rogers says. \u201cWe know you know where it is. Hey. You speak English? Do you speak any English? Jones, ask him if \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d Bucky interrupts, and in a second flat he\u2019s looming over the agent. The man is bound hands and feet to a wooden chair. \u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d Bucky says. The man\u2019s eyes are wide and angry, and he\u2019s clenching his jaw closed tight. \u201cOpen your fucking mouth!\u201d Bucky draws his Colt and shoots the operative in the foot. He keens in pain, a terrible sound, and his mouth widens just enough that Bucky can wedge a finger inside and pop out the little cyanide capsule. He flicks it away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Bucky mumbles, and steps back again. \u201cYou gotta watch \u2018em, huh?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gets no reply from the company and so he bends down and props his hands on his knees. He waits until the Nazi is looking him in the eye. \u201cHey, motherfucker,\u201d Bucky says, kindly enough. \u201cYou speak any English? Nein? Look, I got a bullet for your other foot, too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Kraut spits. His eyes are popped with fury, and he\u2019s sweating bullets from the pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky smiles at him so wide he feels his eyes crinkle. He claps the guy on the shoulder. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? Now it\u2019s like this. I don\u2019t wanna hurt you. I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s been a long day. But you fucked with my team, and you fucked with me, and then you made a big mistake: you fucked with my Captain. So my hands are just tied, sweetheart. Now you owe me something. You understand? I can be real hospitable. But you\u2019re gonna spill your guts, one way or another.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSergeant,\u201d Cap says. When Bucky turns he pulls his knife. Habitually he flips it around in his hand, twirling it with his fingers; a tic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got this?\u201d Steve asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky shrugs, and he says, \u201cFifteen minutes. You boys take a walk.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes a mess, but Bucky has the intel in ten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>You remember staying up late reading Dracula out loud to each other under the covers, back when your ma was still alive? And we were havin the best time, scaring ourselves like a couple of idiots, until all of a sudden a police siren started up outside and we both screamed fit to wake the people in West Virginia. Then your ma came flying down the hall with a bread knife of all things at the ready, and she made us turn out the lights. So we did, and then of course I tried to act all tough, but I slept next to you that night anyway. Funny, I guess. Turns out that you\u2019re still my favorite hiding place. Funny, too: turns out there are scarier things in the dark than vampires.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tell you something. Tell you another secret, because this one, this one I won\u2019t ever tell, not to God, not to a priest, and sure as hell not to you. In that base we burned the bodies in a furnace.

Non-TM meditation technique to relive tension.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>iloved-youfirst\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>so obviously i loved unrequited, fourth time i\u2019ve seen it, cried like a baby, etc, but\u00a0when we came out my mom was totally confused about that scene in the middle,\u00a0you know,\u00a0<em>that scene</em>, and basically there was this painfully awkward moment where i\u00a0explained to her that, yeah, that actually was in one of them. like, how did she not know\u00a0this?\u00a0<em>everybody knows about that letter.</em></p>\n<p>lollyps:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is your mom between the ages of maybe forty-five and sixty? Because if so, she probably didn\u2019t know that one existed, considering it was literally almost impossible to get a hold of the letters between 1966 and 1975. The second that they were released Howard Stark sued the NYT for so much money \u2014 yeah, still undisclosed \u2014 that they\u00a0almost went bankrupt. Don\u2019t learn that one about him in school, do you? Besides the billion and one anti-disclosure agreements he probably made every single one of his employees sign, there was also\u00a0a huge uproar among the American public, particularly inside the military, and soon enough that shit was almost completely shut down. So basically a whole generation didn\u2019t get to read/study the letters the way that people from 1975 on have, because there were only about 300,000 copies distributed in that one day, and after that, the printing of those letters was stopped entirely. Even when copies started to slip out in the late \u201960\u2019s/early \u201970\u2019s, most of them were paraphrased and/or censored beyond recognition. (He says \u201cfuck\u201d, like, twenty-some times, idk. Not exactly good for our Puritanical values.)</p>\n<p>TL;DR, for years, Barnes\u2019 letters were really, incredibly rare. In fact, they\u2019re\u00a0one of the most heavily censored and widely banned works of literature in\u00a0history. And also,\u00a0<em>that</em>\u00a0letter? I mean, by modern standards, and before Joe Wright worked his magic in Unrequited\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem too explicit or anything, right? But in 1966 that was probably the most heavily censored of them all.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>There\u2019s this feeling I get after a firefight, when the shells are still bouncing across the ground, and I\u2019m still a little blind and deaf, but the whole world is crystal clear, and I could just fall to the ground and cry like a baby because I\u2019m still alive. The first time I felt it I thought I was going to burst out of my skin. And then everything rushed back so quick I felt like a newborn. The whole world was brand-new and I was on top of it. I could swallow it whole.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You think I haven\u2019t seen the same look on your face?\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The closest I\u2019ve ever been to the Garden of Eden is the genesis on the battlefield when the shrapnel\u2019s still falling like hail on a tin roof. You look at me with those blue eyes all hot and electric in your face, blood on your cheek, soot smudged over your nose. Bone of my bones. Were you taken from my rib? You must have been, or maybe I was made from yours. And God damn, I want it. I want back inside you. I want you now, same as I wanted you before, prettier than hell even with a bloodied nose and split knuckles. Don\u2019t care you were smaller. Liked it, even \u2014 same as I like you this way too. You make me hungry. You understand? You make me hungry. That mouth pink like spun sugar, though it doesn\u2019t stop you from talking fit to cut anyone down to bits with your angry words. A spitfire since you learned how to speak, and I\u2019ll tell you something, it\u2019s hell to love a fighter.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Anyway, Jesus \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t even be thinking it, much less writing it down. I used to love you so sweet, the way kids love, the way I was supposed to. Then it turned greedy and true. If there\u2019s any Heaven that\u2019s fit for me it\u2019d be all your pale skin under my hands for the rest of eternity. I wouldn\u2019t need anything else. Not food or drink or sleep. Just my hands on you and your sweet love-sounds.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I think it\u2019s fit I take it to the grave. Wouldn\u2019t make you any happier. In fact it\u2019d do nothing but put you in danger \u2014 that ain\u2019t something I want. It\u2019s another story I tell myself, I guess. That I\u2019m being noble and doing it for you, when really I\u2019m just being scared, and can\u2019t do it to myself.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible at this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want a picture, just ask my ma, there\u2019s one of me all done up in dress \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you like that,\u201d Steve says, and frowns down at his tiny battered sketchbook. \u201cQuit fidgeting.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou quit,\u201d Bucky mumbles, reflexively. But he tries. He goes back to working on his knives \u2014 he likes two in each boot, now, and one inside his jacket \u2014 cleaning and rearranging. Cleaning the cache is just the same anymore as the way he used to shower and shave and take his socks off before bed. He\u2019s collected these knives from dead Nazis, and so a lot of them have swastikas scraped off. He has a lighter, too, from a HYDRA operative, and their gory symbol is carved on the top. Bucky\u2019s been working on scratching off the tentacles attached to the skull, but one of them is stubborn, and it won\u2019t be removed. He likes to carve things in where the Kraut\u2019s symbols used to be. Dugan still has Bucky\u2019s second liberated masterpiece from \u201943: a Nazi trench knife. BURY ME FACE DOWN, says one side of the handle, and the other side reads, SO THE WHOLE WORLD CAN KISS MY ASS.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Outside their tent the forest is quiet and the fire burns low. The boys talk. Sometimes Steve mumbles an obscenity when he messes up, <em>motherfucker</em>, and Bucky likes the familiar sound of the word. Bucky loses himself in disassembling and cleaning and reassembling his Colt. He thinks of each step in the process as he performs it. His mind goes quiet the same way it would when he spent a summer working with his hands at the factory across town. Like hand-to-hand, or shooting, or sex, there\u2019s a ritual here; the ritual lulls him. The oil is slick like blood, or even a girl. Few things in life are honest like those things are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got that song in my head,\u201d Steve says, after a second. \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d and he hums the tune, terribly, endearingly off-key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t it,\u201d Bucky laughs. \u201cIt goes, <em>nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen</em>\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve murmurs, \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p>\n<p>But now it\u2019s in Bucky\u2019s head too, and as he works he croons soft: \u201c<em>Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen, glory hallelujah\u2026If you get there before I do, oh yes Lord, tell all my friends I\u2019m comin\u2019 too\u2026</em>\u201d And he meanders his way through the whole song, hearing Louis\u2019 big band in his head while he does:</p>\n<p>\n<em>Although you see me</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Goin\u2019 on so, oh yes,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have my trials here below,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh yes, Lord\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cShoulda been in the pictures,\u201d says Steve, tilting a smile. He\u2019s always liked Bucky\u2019s voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I am a handsome devil.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falsworth sticks his head through the flap of the tent and Steve and Bucky jump. Falsworth looks between them. Steve isn\u2019t guilty because he doesn\u2019t have anything to be guilty about, but Bucky is terrified, and the fear closes tight around his throat. He doesn\u2019t like people sneaking up, not even Monty \u2014 who isn\u2019t even \u201cpeople\u201d but instead like a brother. He feels like he\u2019s been caught doing something terrible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Bucky asks, too sharply.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJones received orders for marching from base. Thought you ought to know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d says Steve, in that authoritative way he\u2019s adopted, devoid of his usual emotion. It\u2019s his stage voice, and Bucky doesn\u2019t like hearing it, not when it\u2019s only the two of them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falsworth lingers. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were an artist, Captain,\u201d is what he finally says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve turns a little red over his nose and shrugs. \u201cYeah. Went to school for it for a while. But, well, bills; you know. We tried, but in the end it was only for a couple courses.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falsworth is thoughtful. Outside Dugan barks out that distinctive laugh and Bucky almost flinches. \u201cIt\u2019s an astounding likeness.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Steve, offering up a smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falsworth goes out and his footsteps crunch and fade and his voice rejoins the conversation. Steve doesn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to check up on the Colonel\u2019s orders. Bucky doesn\u2019t question it because he doesn\u2019t mind; instead he starts a cigarette with his liberated lighter and begins to clean his rifle. After a while he feels eyes on him, and looks up. \u201cHmm?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know where I want to go?\u201d says Steve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCentral.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen a while, huh.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve sighs. \u201cSit in the park and draw. That\u2019s what I want to do. Eat a hot dog. Visit your sister in Hoboken.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky is immediately disgusted and almost chokes on his inhale at the pure horror. \u201cWe ain\u2019t going to Jersey. Not even Becca can get me out to Jersey.\u201d Not even <em>Steve </em>could get him out to Jersey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve smiles at the corner of his mouth, which means his mind is a million miles away again. Bucky doesn\u2019t mind. He takes a long drag and starts to pack his weapons away, methodically. Steve is thinking about going back home. It\u2019s something he wants to do. That\u2019s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cTruth is you couldn\u2019t pay me money to go back to Hoboken,\u201d Steve says, picking up their conversation again. Bucky looks up to see him chewing at his stub of a pencil for a minute. He knows that this is true: Steve is a Fulton Landing boy through and through, and the thought of him living anywhere but their worn slice of Brooklyn is unimaginable. The horns honking, and the murky city air, and the godawful smell of the neighbors cooking \u2014 the socialists, the artist types: Steve belongs there at dusk, with his pale feet hanging off the fire escape. Bucky looks at Steve and misses home, but only partway. Steve is in front of him, after all. He can\u2019t miss home that much. Most of home is right here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t say it,\u201d Steve says, stretching, and cracking his knuckles. He\u2019s finished sketching, and Bucky is finished with his knives and guns. \u201cBut gosh, I miss bar fights. Remember that place \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jesus</em>, no; I\u2019m trying to forget,\" Bucky groans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve grins. \u201cIt was a good bar.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought you were gonna go blind and deaf, way you were bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA good fuckin\u2019 bar,\u201d Steve insists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bucky agrees. \u201cYeah, tell that to your nose. You should try breakin\u2019 it for a third time, maybe Morita can set it straight, finally \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve kicks at him. Bucky blows smoke in his face. Then Steve sighs. \u201cLet\u2019s go out. See where Phillips wants us next.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky is so full of questions for Steve these days. He likes this, Bucky knows \u2014 he likes the fight, and the rush, and he likes doing what\u2019s right, and he likes helping, and he likes leading the team. But he also doesn\u2019t like it. Captain America isn\u2019t Steve: Captain America is someone with a very steady and commanding voice, and someone who avoids alleyway fights, and probably someone cornfed, with eyes like the Kansas sky, and raised in Kansas, too \u2014 or one of those other miserable places that Bucky doesn\u2019t know the name of. It hits him, sometimes: If he wasn\u2019t here there wouldn\u2019t be a single person on Earth who understood Steve. Not even Carter, who knew Steve before, knows him all the way. It makes him afraid. Bucky wants people to know Steve, and not Captain America. Steve is worth knowing.</p>\n<p>He is right, though, and they do have to go out \u2014 back into this exhausting world. But first: \u201cLet me see.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve hands over the sketch. At first Bucky doesn\u2019t realize who it is he\u2019s looking at. The drawing is of a man sitting with shadows spread out around him, and the shadows are dark and flat and threatening shapes. He holds another shadow, a pistol, with his right hand, and with his left he reaches for something unseen. His hands have immensely defined knuckles and tendons and thick square fingers. His face is in profile, his features sharp, and the lines are thick and black and minimal, drawn with a heavy hand: the prominent mouth, the heavy brow, the straight nose, and the curved chin. Hair falls from the pomade and arches over his forehead. A cigarette dangles out of his mouth and the smoke curls up. Most of his face is in shadow, and the details are only suggested. The muscles of his arms are big and the sleeveless white undershirt he wears is tight across the broad shoulders and chest. His tags glint, somehow, in the low light. He looks like he\u2019s been sweating and working all day, and like the work has been bloody. He looks rough, and like he\u2019d be rough with you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be Bucky, but it is. He trusts Steve\u2019s hand more than a mirror. It\u2019s him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He needs to stop pretending that he isn\u2019t who he\u2019s becoming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he says, and hands it back. \u201cYou still got it, Rogers.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve looks at it, critically. \u201cI do, don\u2019t I?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky puts out his cigarette, and Steve tucks away the sketchbook, and then they face the night.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>It turns out they don\u2019t march for another day, and so the guys have decided to spend their respite drinking Dugan\u2019s paint peeler around the fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this fucking moonshine?\u201d demands Morita, after a second of astounded choking. He sounds impressed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan takes back the can for a second swig. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ne tirez pas,\u201d </em>Dernier is saying.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ne tir-ez \u2014\u201c\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cTirez,\u201d </em>Dernier corrects.</p>\n<p>\u201cTeach him something dirty,\u201d Dugan suggests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Bucky replies. \u201cTeach him how to swear in two languages and his tongue will turn to stone from all the sinnin\u2019.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky of course should know better, and should know never to say anything like that to this firecracker, because Steve turns from where he sits by the fire with his eyes bright and a flush on his face says, \u201c<em>Va te faire foutre, </em>asshole.\u201d Steve Rogers telling Bucky to go fuck himself\u00a0in French: Jesus Christ, that needs to be illegal in all forty-eight states and Allied territory besides.</p>\n<p>Bucky just flips him off, and Jones and Dernier howl with laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrupting Captain America,\u201d sighs Morita.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s corrupt enough on his own,\u201d Bucky says, and when he sits down Steve jams his elbow into his ribs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falsworth hums. \u201cArt school.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky fixes him with a look, feeling guilty about earlier, and jokes, \u201cYou got <em>no</em> idea,\u201d and then:\u00a0 \u201cDum Dum, hit me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan hands over his contraband alcohol right away, reaching across the fire. \u201cDrink enough of that and maybe you\u2019ll actually sleep tonight instead or prowling around like a big angry cat, Sarge.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky takes a drink. Morita was right: this shit could make you blind. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he agrees. Dugan worries over him, but Bucky worries over Steve, and he worries about Steve sleeping somewhere safe. Bucky doesn\u2019t need to sleep, anyway; or at least he\u2019s found, through intensive trial and error, that he can manage on only a few hours a week. He doesn\u2019t like to think about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>J\u2019\u00e9tudie l\u2019art</em>, \u201d says Jones.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sans dec?</em>\u201d asks Steve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Poesie</em>,\u201d Jones says. Steve doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cPoetry,\u201d Jones says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuck writes,\u201d Steve offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Bucky says, waving a hand, another swallow of the alcohol down. He passes it over to Steve. \u201cI tell stories. It\u2019s a different thing. Nothing to be proud of. Steve\u2019s got real talent.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Conneries</em>,\u201d Steve says to Bucky. Helpfully, and with big innocent eyes, he adds: \u201cThat means bullshit.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? You see what I put up with?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guys laugh. \u201cJesus,\u201d Steve swears, after he takes a drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTold you so,\u201d Morita says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The look on Steve\u2019s face is affronted because of the terrible taste, and it\u2019s making Bucky laugh. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ve had worse.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit makin\u2019 us seem like those kind of Irish, Barnes. Your ma \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what she\u2019d say.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t I ever.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve tries to hand the can back. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cYou keep drinkin\u2019. I never get to see you all liquored up anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t get drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then maybe you just haven\u2019t practiced hard enough. You know what they say about getting to Carnegie Hall, Rogers.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Steve\u2019s laughing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome <em>on</em>,\u201d Bucky says, and leans back on his elbows, knocking his knees into Steve\u2019s. Steve grimaces and takes another long drink, and he shudders when it goes down, shaking his head and passing it back to Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeelin\u2019 it?\u201d Bucky asks. He grins lazily. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re feelin\u2019 it. I know that look.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Tu es</em>\u00a0<em>le pire putain</em>,\u201d Steve says, and Dernier and Jones snort. \u201cA little,\u201d Steve concedes. \u201cI\u2019m feeling it a <em>little</em>. Not a lot, unfortunately.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Bucky decides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Steve says, and then, familiarly, \u201cC\u2019mon, Buck, I dare you,\u201d and so Bucky takes another drink, and it burns all the way down his throat, and even in his nose. He gives the can over to Jones and then fishes around for another smoke and feels eyes on him. Falsworth is looking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got a light?\u201d Bucky asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, startled, and gives a smoke to Bucky, and his lighter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky lights up his second cigarette of the night and takes a drag. Steve plucks it nimbly out of his hand with his long artist\u2019s fingers, inhales, flicks the ash, and then hands it back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell us a poem,\u201d Dernier says to Jones.</p>\n<p>\u201cRecite,\u201d Jones corrects, absently. \u201cUh, <em>reciter</em>.

Web.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch that.\"</p>\n<p>Everything in Stark\u2019s lab is covered in grease and oil, and there are, thrillingly, always between one and four cigarettes burning dangerously close to something flammable. Bucky loves it here. It\u2019s like science fiction, or something from the movies. It reminds Bucky of both the garages and the factories where he\u2019s found work. He likes watching the machines go about their business. He wants to poke at everything and get his hands dirty. Things slotting neatly into other things, pistons and engines doing their work; it\u2019s his favorite thing. He feels like a kid again, and his hands itch to make about a million model airplanes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s she looking?\u201d Bucky asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlorious,\u201d Stark tells him, \u201c<em>Naturally</em>. Jesus, what do you expect?\u201d He shoves his goggles up onto his forehead and hands Bucky\u2019s rifle over. \u201cNew scope; tinkered with the focus, tightened up the recoil. It\u2019s an experimental model, you understand, just something I\u2019ve been doing on the side. How does it feel?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky takes the rifle and weighs it, and then he lifts it up to test the sights.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, watch where you <em>point that</em>,\u201d Stark complains, and pushes it away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky can\u2019t help but grin at him over the top of the scope. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Stark. You got a couple more of these somewhere?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m already outfitting your French guy with explosives; don\u2019t get greedy. Look, I got places to be \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is it you keep rushing off to, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark smirks at him. There\u2019s a dimly manic gleam in his tired eyes. \u201cMapping the planets with Copernicus,\u201d he says. Then he seems to spot someone approaching behind Bucky, and his spine snaps straight. \u201cCompany,\u201d he announces. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Sarge.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stark books it, as to be expected. And so Bucky starts to disassemble his rifle in the hopes of getting to know her a little better. He can hear Stark\u2019s conversation almost a room away and keeps his head down, hoping; but sure enough the telltale click-clack of small practical heels approaches him anyway. Goddammit, Bucky thinks, and then starts to swear the way that Morita has taught all of them to: God-mother-fucking-damn-it-all-to-hell-fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>James Barnes is a gentleman. He is a gentleman to a fault. He has never hated his gentlemanly upbringing as much as he does in this second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a moment?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA few, even.\u201d Bucky doesn\u2019t know whether to stand or stay seated, but Agent Carter solves that for him: she sits down on the opposite side of Stark\u2019s workbench before he gets the chance to even push his chair back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you liking it?\u201d Agent Carter asks.</p>\n<p>Bucky is confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Johnson.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good gun. Stark\u2019s made some adjustments, the recoil really used to be a bi\u2014 uh, a problem. You know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carter\u2019s red mouth tips at one side into a smile. Bucky watches as she bends and reaches into her boot. She pulls out the tiniest pistol he\u2019s ever seen \u2014 it fits into her small palm snugly, like a black baby bird that has wet and slick feathers. \u201cHoward made this. It\u2019s very useful for tight situations. It gives me bruises, though. The recoil can certainly be a bitch.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky is startled into laughing. Goddamn, he thinks, but she\u2019s so beautiful, and in every way so unexpected: really just a dime, and smart as hell to boot. Just like Steve. What a pair. And like that Bucky\u2019s heart goes stone cold and heavy inside him, and he gets back to reassembling his rifle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything I can help you with?\u201d he deflects.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d says Agent Carter. She procures a file. \u201cI\u2019ve finished some recon work outside of Montoire. There\u2019s a heavy faction of HYDRA growing there. I have reason to believe that their goal is to march on Paris, and perhaps form a link with the headquarters located in Strasbourg.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSchmidt?\u201d Bucky asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNowhere,\u201d confesses Carter, sighing. \u201cThe base self-destructed before I could get anything else.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky stares at her. \u201cYou stormed a HYDRA base? <em>Alone</em>?\u201d And just like that he suddenly has not only one but two insufferably stupid Steves in his life. He remembers his manners too late. \u201cCarter, look, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI infiltrated,\u201d Carter corrects. She doesn\u2019t sound too clipped, and Bucky hopes that he hasn\u2019t made her angry. Except, of course, how he does. \u201cThings just got\u2026out of hand.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jesus God, thinks Bucky: there really <em>are </em>two of them. \u201cI see,\u201d he says, faintly. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway. This is for you and Captain Rogers to look over. I\u2019ve spoken to Colonel Phillips and this should be where you\u2019re headed next. Many of the operatives survived the blast, and they\u2019ve gone to ground. We\u2019ll fish them out soon enough. They could prove useful.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky takes the file. He flips it open to find a blueprint of the base and Carter\u2019s mission report. \u201cUseful, huh?\u201d he mutters, speculative. \u201cWell, we all know I got a way with useful.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He regrets it for a second, speaking to a lady about that, but then Carter replies, unflinchingly: \u201cYes, you certainly do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky looks up at her. He comes to the late realization that this intel should have gone to Steve, and not to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carter has pinned him with her eyes now. In this light they have the color of pennies, arresting and copperish. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she continues, \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to speak to you about. The project that Howard is currently working on is facing some difficulties, and we might be able to use your \u2014 expertise, as it is.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat so?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume that you\u2019re in no rush to leave the strike team. But I thought I\u2019d warn you that there are a number of people who are eager to recruit you. And after the war\u2026well, you\u2019ll certainly have a job somewhere, if you want it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky thinks this over. He doesn\u2019t make it a habit to think past the war, not the way that he knows the other guys do. He stopped doing that since the table. \u201cMuscle or intelligence?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth, potentially. You\u2019ve developed a very unique skill set, and you would be a tremendous asset.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky is just opening his mouth to reply \u2014 he has no idea what he\u2019s going to say, but he is going to say something \u2014 when they both start at the sound of Steve\u2019s voice, calling his name.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBuck, hey, I was thinking we\u2019d \u2014 Peggy. I mean, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Bucky has to sit through this again, it looks like. At least he\u2019s got his Johnson back in one piece and so he can get out of here before Steve manages to turn any redder or accidentally knock over some chairs. This conversation with Carter has put him on edge enough; he doesn\u2019t want to see Steve all sweet and embarrassed just now, and he especially doesn\u2019t want her to be the cause of it. It makes his stomach turn unpleasantly; it makes him want to touch Steve, somehow, or make him laugh: he wants to show her. It\u2019s an ugly thought \u2014 not, he scoffs to himself, a <em>gentlemanly</em> one \u2014 and so he pushes it back, and stands himself up.</p>\n<p>\u201cCarter,\u201d he nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her eyes are sharp. Steve hasn\u2019t distracted her, and there isn\u2019t a doubt in his mind that they will be talking about this later. \u201cBarnes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky slaps Steve on the shoulder as he passes. \u201cSee you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d Steve asks, his brow furrowing up.<br>\n<br>\nAt the doorway Bucky holds up his rifle. \u201cWhere do you think? Testing her out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>24 RUE DE L\u2019ARBRE-SEC</p>\n<p>DR A Z\u00a0</p>\n<p>LYON, FRANKREICH</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">DOCH WERDEN SIE ANBEI\u00dfEN?</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cBut will they bite,\u201d Jones translates. He frowns at the intercepted telegram. \u201cBut will they <em>bite. </em>Bite what?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBait,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cLike we\u2019re fish, or at least someone is. Like someone is fish.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so they go to France, but there\u2019s nothing in France: nothing but the beautiful abandoned buildings and the frightened crying people. Lyon turns up nothing. Dernier looks sad to be home. If New York ever ended up like this Bucky would be sad too. Finally they give up the ghost and receive orders to march to a safe house miles and miles away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry up to wait,\u201d mumbles Steve in their tent, and under the cover of darkness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the killing business,\u201d Bucky replies, pragmatic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>News is bad. News is always bad. They\u2019re losing more men on the front, and more money to the fight, and there\u2019s already no money to be had. Europe is in greasy dying tatters. Bucky thinks of the bodies in the furnace, and the word of the camps.</p>\n<p>They walk and walk. They walk, and then: revelation.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Dugan says. There isn\u2019t even any sarcasm in his voice. He is honestly and innocently dumbstruck. Bucky imagines this is how he was as a kid. \u201cCap, you sure we\u2019re at the right place?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s jaw is hanging open. \u201cYeah,\u201d he replies, and corrects, \u201cWell, I mean, these were the coordinates.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a castle, or a mansion; either way it is, without a doubt, the biggest and most beautiful building Bucky has ever seen. The grounds are massive and dignified and ancient and blue and white; there are statues, real life, honest-to-God statues. There\u2019s a courtyard, and bushes shorn into various geometrical if overgrown shapes. Withering wildflowers have staked claim over the grounds. They crush them under their filthy boots as they walk; the flowers smell good, even though they are dying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAgent Carter said that it\u2019ll be tight quarters,\u201d says Steve as they approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lot of nasty responses come to Bucky\u2019s mind at that one \u2014 what, nice English lady is used to better digs than this? \u2014 but he bites down on all of them. This is a beautiful place; he can\u2019t be cruel, not in a beautiful place. \u201cDon\u2019t really see that being a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe told me that there are a lot of works from the Louvre being held here. Have been since \u201939. The French moved them out when Nazi forces started marching; they didn\u2019t want the art to get damaged if Paris ends up burning. So a lot of it is packed inside.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky grins at him. Things are funny. Things are strange. \u201cHey, ain\u2019t I always promising to go into the Met with you? Here we are, and one better. Art museum. In <em>France</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve rolls his eyes, and Bucky cuffs him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are tall steps that lead to the entrance door. The stairs are lined with big statues of stone lions. Bucky looks deep into their frozen and ferocious maws. Their teeth glint. The door is painted ivory, and the paint is peeling. When Steve swings it open it goes quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dull afternoon light illuminates all the dust they\u2019ve disturbed, and it floats finely through the air. The entryway is huge, and the floor inside is marble \u2014 <em>marble, </em>Steve, Bucky wants to say. But Bucky can hardly see any of the floor, because the entire room is filled with crates: huge crates, tiny crates, open crates. The open crates hold oil paintings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silently the company picks their way through. One of the paintings \u2014 Bucky stays back to look at it. Only half is visible. Bucky sees five fingers digging into a man\u2019s naked torso, pulling his skin, and drawing pinpricks of blood. The colors are vibrant and the skin looks unimaginably real. In the background there are bodies, and the bodies are on fire. It scares him, and so he catches up with the team.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow he doesn\u2019t see it at first. Maybe because it\u2019s so unimaginably huge; when he first walks in, he only notices the base. But then he looks up, and up, and up. She is maybe ten feet tall. Her back is arched and she stands with her right foot forward, planted strongly to her rock, like she may jump, or fly, or is flying. A pair of massive wings \u2014 feathered, and muscular, and thick \u2014 expand back and away. Her marble robes billow and whip around her legs, and press tight to her lean torso; the fierce line of her shoulders is slanted. She has no face and no arms. The dusty orange light illuminates the strong lines of her thighs and shoulders: it catches on her stone clothing, and it casts a shadow for each and every feather.</p>\n<p>Bucky looks to Steve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mon Dieu</em>,\u201d says Dernier, and his voice is blankly stunned.</p>\n<p>Steve \u2014 slowly, slowly, he paces around her. He can\u2019t seem to look away. His blue eyes are almost translucent in the dusk light. His face is naked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Elle est encore plus belle que j\u2019ai jamais cru possible</em>,\u201d says Dernier, still quiet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oui</em>,\u201d says Steve, and his hushed voice breaks on him. \u201c<em>Oui.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Bucky doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying; Bucky doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s arrested where he stands. She has no face \u2014 she has no face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d asks Jim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Winged Victory of Samothrace.\u201d It\u2019s Steve who answers. His voice is almost silent, but so is the room, and the sound echoes off the dust. \u201cShe\u2019s the goddess of victory. Nike. They found her in the 1800\u2019s. I didn\u2019t even think\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve turns away very suddenly and looks to Bucky. \u201cBuck,\u201d he says, and his voice is helpless and lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky replies, and he steps closer, so their shoulders touch. Bucky knows the truth now. It is a deep and insurmountable truth. She has no face. Like the operative whose head he beat in, like the boy who he killed one month into active duty, even like Bucky himself, Nike is faceless. Bucky feels unprepared, or like he should have brought an offering.</p>\n<p>Beside him Steve quakes before the oldest and the only god.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuck,\u201d Steve repeats, strangled now. His brows are drawn together and his mouth is twisted. His lashes are dark and wet. Bucky has mud on his face and his toes are numb, and Steve is no better: filthy hair, and blood dried at his lip. When he looks finally to Bucky the moment stretches, precariously balanced. The world whittles away, and boils down the untruths. They are the only people in the room. They are, familiarly, the only people in the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dust motes float through the air and land on her monumental wings.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, go on,\u201d Bucky says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asks.</p>\n<p>Bucky nods to her. \u201cGo on, Stevie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d says Steve immediately.</p>\n<p>Bucky thinks of whispering to Steve during mass when he shouldn\u2019t have been, and of kissing girls in the confessional. Churches are holy, and Nike is ancient, but Steve is Steve: first, last, and always.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you can,\u201d Bucky replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tentatively and slowly Steve outstretches his dirty hand. Bucky watches his long fingers reach, his skin pink and suddenly translucent in the sunlight. Abruptly he becomes as unreal as Nike: as endless, and as ancient. When he touches the marble fabric of her clothing he inhales, sharply. He flattens his palm there at the defiant line of her hip, and then he tilts his noble head up, and he looks to her.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Here\u2019s a story your mama told me.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>When she came over on the boat she kept getting sick and she couldn\u2019t figure out why. Eventually this lady came up to see if she was fine, and she asked her, when are you due? And your ma said, no, I\u2019m only seasick.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m supposed to take the rest of this story to the grave, but I doubt anyone will care to find these anyway.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>So it turned out the woman from the Old Country was right, and your ma cried herself sick because she was so scared and alone. You see now why I was supposed to take this one to the grave? She asks the woman, the hell will I do? I don\u2019t have any money and nobody on God\u2019s green Earth will hire an Irish girl fresh off the ship, especially when she\u2019s in a family way. Now the woman, she was feeling terrible about this, terrible for this young girl who had nowhere else to turn. And the woman\u2019s husband, he\u2019d died in the war. So she slipped off the band around her finger and put it on your mama\u2019s. Then she told your ma her last name, and her husband\u2019s first name, and said it was time to start over again anyway.\u00a0So your ma did. She bought a plot at the cemetery and said it was your da's. That grave is empty, same way mine will be. That rosary you got with you, the one you think is his -- it was hers. It was hers all along.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>After she finished whispering it out to me, the whole truth of her life, she started hacking up a lung. I got her water, I remember, and then I asked \u2014 well, what anyone else would, I guess. I asked why she did it. Why she picked me to tell. She looked me in the eye and she said, remember how she used to call me, she said, \u201cJames Buchanan, I\u2019m not long for this Earth. I told you because I know. You and me; you and me, James, we\u2019re the same kind of storyteller.\u201d\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I still don\u2019t understand what it was that she knew. I got my suspicions. I think she saw in me the thief and impostor she saw in herself. We understood one another, your ma and I. I was a good kid, back home \u2014 straight A\u2019s till I dropped out, good at my job, good to my dates, a gentleman. I was so proud of those things, and turns out it don\u2019t matter at all. Even though you were the troublemaker we were both from the wrong side of the tracks. Brooklyn tough, and no changing us \u2014 do anything for each other, won\u2019t we? I\u2019ve stolen and lied and cheated, and mostly, I\u2019ve done it for you. Not because you asked \u2014 you didn\u2019t ask your ma either, and you would never ask anyone, considering you\u2019d choke on your pride if you ever tried swallowing it. But like me, she did it for you all the same. \u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>She told me that at first she was scared as hell of loving you. She said she didn\u2019t know if she could, because she thought she\u2019d always be waiting for you to die, and she couldn\u2019t stand anyone else dyin on her. I finally bucked up and asked her how long she had actually loved you for. You know what she told me? She said, that\u2019s a stupid question.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>She died in the night while we slept in our beds. I heard the news first, because I guess I was just up and out first, taking her bread, or soup, or something. All I saw of her was her white hand while they took her away. I remember walking all the way back to your apartment, hadn\u2019t seen you in maybe a day and a half, and I knew I had to tell you but I also knew I didn\u2019t want to. So I let myself in, quiet as a mouse, and sure enough you were still asleep in bed. All I could do was look at you and wish to God that I could put a spin on this one, too \u2014 make it all alright again.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>At the end she was so tired.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Never really thought about the future. Never really could think much past you. In that respect, your ma and I had something in common, God rest her soul. But neither of us, I don\u2019t think, were ever meant for much. Here\u2019s the truth \u2014 baby, here\u2019s the truth. I\u2019ve got a rootless heart. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m meant for loving, or at least not anymore. And I should die out here. I\u2019m the kind of guy who\u2019s not meant to go back. I try to imagine a life after this and it just won\u2019t come. So forget about me, will you? If it\u2019ll make you happy. Live glorious, eat like a king, laugh until the sun comes up, never look back. Don\u2019t you dare look back. More than anything I want to know that you kept on. More than anything I want to know that you took on the world \u2014 everything else seems to matter less and less.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>So how long have I loved you for? Womb to tomb, sweetheart. Since before I was even here at all. I get it now, you understand. Your ma was right. It really is a stupid question.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I SHALL FEAR NO EVIL, and on the other side of the knife \u2014 Hitler youth, with eyes blue as the Connecticut sky \u2014 Bucky carves, FOR I AM THE EVILEST MOTHERFUCKER IN THE VALLEY.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the mirror Bucky twists his mouth to the left to get a better angle for the shave. He finishes up, runs the tap, grabs a towel. He thinks of nothing in particular. When he pulls the towel away there\u2019s a little drop of red on it. Bucky pats at the side of his face and then down along his jaw. Back at the hinge of it he feels wetness. Tipping his head so he can see it in the mirror, Bucky feels around. There\u2019s only a little blood \u2014 somehow he\u2019s scraped himself up. A thin little piece of skin is hanging loose, like maybe he accidentally pulled off a scab. He gets it between his thumb and forefinger and pulls. It doesn\u2019t hurt. He pulls, and underneath his skin there\u2019s red, like a muscle, but smoother. Bucky pulls more. He pulls and pulls. Now he can see all the sinew of his jaw and beneath it the bone. He gets a better grip. The cartilage of his nose comes away with the skin. He pulls \u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only by the skin of his teeth that he catches the scream and holds it inside his throat. Around him the men are out cold, and even Steve is asleep, all curled up with his blond head facing away. Bucky\u2019s breath is coming in huge gasps and his eyes are wet. The fire is low, casting weird shadows across the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSarge?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky starts and turns. It\u2019s Jones. He\u2019s propped again a tree, rifle in hand, on watch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSarge,\u201d Jones repeats, wary.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Bucky says, quiet, so as not to wake anyone. \u201cPerimeter clear?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cClear.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s heart is hammering in his mouth. He swallows hard. \u201cYou\u2019re a prayin\u2019 man, aren\u2019t you, Private?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jones agrees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still got your faith?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I can still pray, even if I don\u2019t got much faith left? I mean, do you think it\u2019s alright? You think it\u2019s allowed?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jones thinks about this. Bucky appreciates that. After a moment he says, \u201cYes. I think He\u2019s always listening, and that He listens to everyone. I think there\u2019s always a chance at redemption.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s fingers shake when he reaches over and starts digging around in Steve\u2019s pack. Jones doesn\u2019t seem worried. It takes a second, but there it is: the familiar worn and ovular beads of his rosary. Bucky draws it out and holds the heavy metal of the crucifix in his palm. With his right hand he makes the sign of the cross and mumbles out the words. In the name of the Father at his forehead, and the Son between his ribs, and the Holy Ghost in the hollows of his shoulders, Amen. He worries the beads as he keeps track of his prayers. Jones doesn\u2019t say another word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026And because of this as well, these letters are irrevocably entrenched in pop culture \u2014 in the way that we, as a society, quantify emotions like love or pain. In fact, they have redefined our collective consciousness. We love them because they\u2019re a scandal, and because they\u2019re sensational, but we also love them because they give us a look into the past, into our national past. And maybe that past isn\u2019t exactly what we thought it was. I think that all Americans have a sort of vested idealism in the 1940\u2019s; we try to emulate the styles, or we\u2019re envious of how much simpler or sweeter life was back then. Barnes shows us that none of that is true. He ensures that the scales fall from our eyes. It was a slice of time like any other, and if there was a difference, it\u2019s that life was harder.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Obviously a lot of Barnes\u2019 life was impacted by the Great Depression. I think that one letter in particular shows the economic hardship in a way that\u2019s really vivid and touching. And maybe it\u2019s quaint, sure, but that\u2019s not what I want you to get from this reading. What I want to impart on you, on each of you, is that the struggle of the human condition \u2014 of simply living \u2014 is timeless and universal. There is no one right philosophical lens through which to read these. And that\u2019s what makes these letters so special: we can\u2019t fit them into any one category. No literature professor, no history professor, no economics professor, no gender studies professor; hell, not even a philosopher like myself\u2026none of us can claim that these letters belong to our fields and our fields alone. They belong to all of us. As a country they identify us and as a people they move us. So with this in mind I\u2019d like to thank you for being such an attentive and responsive audience today, and if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll go ahead and finish off my first TED Talk with this reading, which is of James Barnes\u2019 second-to-last letter. And a brief note for context: records tell us that he was shot in battle just before Christmas in 1944. The wound was nearly fatal.\u00a0</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I worried you so bad. I\u2019m just fine, except maybe now you know how I felt last year, when you almost bled out under my hands while I stood there like some kind of helpless schmuck, not having the first God damn idea what to do. I don\u2019t remember a whole lot about the ordeal, but I do remember you shoving your belt between my teeth. I remember I wasn\u2019t allowed to make a lick of noise due to how far behind enemy lines we were, and I remember trying like hell not to. It hurt, sure. Hurt like the Devil himself was digging down and trying to pull out my insides.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I remember after it was over you pressing your forehead against mine. You didn\u2019t say a word but I knew you were afraid. I shut my eyes and for a second I could pretend I was back in Brooklyn. I pretended that our faces were too close because we were sharing a bed in the middle of winter and you had rolled over in your sleep. I swear to God, in that second I could smell the charcoal on your hands from drawing all day, and the motor oil on my skin from working at the garage. When you let out a breath I could even smell the sharp sweet tang of oranges.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Right then I didn\u2019t tell myself any stories. I was dying, and I was glad that it was happening while I was next to you.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told you the whole story before. It\u2019s like everything started around that winter. Like I orbit it, sucked into that year by some big cosmic force of gravity.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It was 1940, the year you kept almost dying on me, but this was before all that. Winter was just coming, and the cough you had was only little, not keeping you in bed for weeks at a time. I knew that even if I couldn\u2019t pay for heat I had to pay at least for some more blankets or quilts. I remember thinking that even if I could steal food I\u2019d need money for your medications.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It was when I got laid off from the garage, and the factory jobs had run out in Brooklyn and Queens \u2014 I think this part you know. I went all over Manhattan, but no one in Midtown wanted to hire me. Finally I ended up at a deli and I flattered the old fella behind the counter with some bullshit I can\u2019t even remember now, maybe how great their cheesecake was, but anyway he finally let me in on a few trade secrets about who around town was looking for help. Anyway, I got the gig at the docks in Chelsea. It was only part time and eventually I had to replace it with the dock job back home, but it was alright money while I could get it. I worked maybe five hours that day, and on the way back to our rickety place I was feeling so lucky I stopped by the market. If you were a dame I probably would have tried to buy you a ring. I could have taken on the whole world because I had the dollar fifty in my pocket they paid me for working on such short notice. It was the first real money I felt like I\u2019d had in years.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>So I was walking around the market, looking around, dried this, canned that\u2026and then I saw some oranges. Heavenly choirs sang when I looked at those oranges. They were so bright and I\u2019d just worked a hard, cold shift, and you had been looking blue and sick for weeks. And all of a sudden the inspiration struck me, and I knew what I had to do.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I swear to God I haggled with Mr. O\u2019Leary over that one single orange for fifteen minutes straight. There was something important to me that day about buying it with the money I\u2019d just made. Finally I got it low enough.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019ll never forget the look on your face when I came in the door and tossed it to you. I can\u2019t even describe it. I\u2019d do anything on earth to make you look at me again like that. I\u2019d fill your whole room up with oranges. I\u2019d fill the apartment with them. The building, even. Give them to you in baskets until the day I die and arrange for them to be sent even after that.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Well, then of course you started worrying over the price and wouldn\u2019t hear of eating it all on your own. So you made me split it with you. I can still taste it \u2014 the way it broke so sweet and tart on my tongue, got sticky all over my fingers. Do you remember, we even kept squeezing the skin because little bursts of flavor would puff out away from it that we could see and smell. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tasted anything like that before or since. It was like a whole summer feast laid out right in front of us, even though it was just one fruit and not summer at all, but instead that terrible time of year when winter sneaks down; starts killing the flowers.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Never told another soul this, and I guess I never will, but I think of that orange, that one evening, every single time when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m about to snuff it for real. Thought about it in my first firefight and thought about it when the Germans stuck me full of needles and sliced up the soles of my feet. And when I was shot the other day and so sure it was over \u2014 good-bye, motherfuckers, I\u2019m finally going back home \u2014 I wasn\u2019t all that scared. In that one minute it was fine \u2014 everything was alright. I bought an orange. You smiled at me. And Jesus Christ, it was fantastic.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>(Kapoor, Neha. \u201cJames Barnes and the curation of our collective consciousness.\u201d TED Talk. 2006.)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>1945</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d calls Dugan, \u201cBulletproof Barnes!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky gives a careful mock-bow as he approaches from the other side of the command tent.

Come on.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you this much of an asshole before Pearl Harbor?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Bucky says, truthfully, and quieter. \u201cNot even close.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan nods, and looks at his hands. \u201cFor the best,\u201d he says, after a moment. \u201cShe deserves better, don\u2019t she?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky thinks of Steve\u2019s hands cupping his face out in the field the other day. <em>No no no no no</em>, he mouthed, and whispered, <em>Buck</em>, and pressed their foreheads together. \u201cProbably, pal. Probably.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan heaves a sigh. \u201cEnough of that. How you feeling?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPatched me up good,\u201d Bucky says. He\u2019s only a little sore, after all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan eyes him. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, kid.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t lyin\u2019,\u201d Bucky defends. \u201cSure it hurts, but it\u2019s alright.

In Bucky\u2019s cot, too \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t leave overnight, and he insisted on working all day, and he fell asleep finally in the afternoon, at Bucky\u2019s desk. Bucky had worried about a crick in his neck and prodded him into bed. \u201cI\u2019ll wake him up before 1900 hours. Colonel sent orders, and Steve wants to debrief.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCarter?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s somewhere else. Business in town, maybe.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sit in silence for a moment. Dugan lights up a cigarette, and Bucky looks over at him to see his square and sturdy face illuminated for a second by the flame. Then it flickers out. Bucky doesn\u2019t know why he says what he does next. Maybe it\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t told anyone yet, or because he almost died just this week. \u201cShe offered me a job.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan looks suspicious. \u201cCarter?\u201d he asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter all this is over there are positions open. Stark needs muscle on a project, so she says.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the work?\u201d Dugan is squinting. He doesn\u2019t like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I got a skill, don\u2019t I?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan really doesn\u2019t like this. He sucks on his cigarette for a moment, his mustache tilted down. \u201cYou got plenty of skills. What I\u2019m asking is, which one of those skills do Stark and Carter want?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky reaches across the table and steals one of Dugan\u2019s smokes. He fishes a stolen lighter out of his pocket. \u201cInterrogation,\u201d he finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBarnes \u2014\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could bleed a stone, and you know it. It\u2019s a useful trick.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to, though? You really want to do that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky takes a deep inhale and blows the smoke out his nose. It burns. \u201cWhat the hell else will I do? Hmm? If I even get out of this. Go on; I\u2019m takin\u2019 suggestions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamned if I know,\u201d admits Dugan quietly. \u201cJesus; damned if I know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ever think, it\u2019s been two years since we\u2019ve seen the city?\u201d asks Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo goddamn years,\u201d Dugan affirms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can go back. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m \u2014\u201c Bucky cuts himself off and sucks in a breath. \u201cAnyway. Doubt I\u2019ll even make it that far.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you can always shack up with that French girl.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a while Bucky stubs out his smoke, and Dugan sighs. \u201cMe neither,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d be doin\u2019, if I wasn\u2019t doin\u2019 this. I think I forgot how to do other things. What else is there, but killin\u2019 Krauts?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky understands. Nothing else makes sense anymore. The world has narrowed down: Steve\u2019s hair, dirty from the mud; the footsteps of the team, sticking to wet orange autumn leaves; the weight of the rifle on his back, and the weight of his knives in his shoes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dugan pulls out another cigarette and sticks his hand out for Bucky\u2019s lighter. After he lights up he holds it closer so he can read it. DEATH IS OUR BUSINESS, Bucky has carved, AND BUSINESS HAS BEEN GOOD.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like this one,\u201d Dugan tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d Bucky says.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>It turns out that Carter has finally found some solid intel \u2014 Zola surfaced somewhere near Zermatt, which is, according to Morita, apparently some hellhole in Switzerland. Zola either moving north or northwest. Bucky\u2019s hoping for north; he\u2019s never had any particular desire to see the Swiss Alps up close. On top of the table with big sheets of sketchbook paper and even some napkins pushed together, Steve maps out a number of possible routes he might be taking. Everyone has a couple of theories about what Zola was doing so far south \u2014 gathering intel, conspiring with the Italian communists \u2014 but to Bucky, they all sound wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cZola\u2019s a scientist, first and foremost.\u201d It\u2019s a weird power Bucky has these days: he speaks up, and immediately a hush falls. \u201cIf he\u2019s in Italy he\u2019s either transporting cargo back to Austria or Germany, or maybe he was dropping cargo off there. For all we know HYDRA might be growing in Italy. But if it\u2019s Zola, then it has something to do with his experiments. I know him. He wouldn\u2019t travel on politics; he\u2019s too valuable for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guys are nodding but there\u2019s something wrong with the way that Steve, standing beside Bucky, is holding himself. They get through the rest of the informal briefing alright, but by nighttime Steve has still got that almighty furrow tucked between his brows. Bucky, fed up, corners him in the hall outside of the mess after dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he says finally, after all he gets is a halfhearted \u201chey\u201d in greeting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSay what, Buck?\u201d asks Steve.</p>\n<p>Bucky waves a hand. \u201cWhatever\u2019s bothering you. You\u2019re worrying at it so hard you\u2019re giving me a headache. Maybe a second pair of eyes on the problem will do you good.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve remains silent and serious as they walk. Finally he starts. \u201cI know back when \u2014 back <em>when</em>. After the base. I know it shook you up. I just\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just what?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSteve huffs a sigh and turns to look at Bucky fully. They\u2019ve reached the end of the building and stand in the open doorway, coming to a stop. \u201cI just want to make sure that when you made your report to Phillips you told him everything that you knew.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve looks like he\u2019d have more fun getting teeth pulled. He\u2019s pained and uncomfortable and apologetic, but to Bucky it doesn\u2019t change the fact of what\u2019s coming out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve finally meets his gaze. The moonlight bathes their conversation in a strange and eerie glow. \u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 anything, Buck. But you seem to know an awful lot about Zola from your time in that base, and if you think any of it might help us out I\u2019d really appreciate if you\u2019d tell me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fear holds Bucky where he stands.</p>\n<p>This is the problem: Bucky himself doesn\u2019t know what he remembers about his time in that base. It is literally impossible for him to think back on it. He remembers only a few things. He knows with an intimacy that makes his stomach churn Zola\u2019s voice; he\u2019d recognize it deaf. He remembers the pain in his feet, though that could have easily come after, from the walk back to camp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembers chomping down on a bit. The whole ordeal was a blur of pain, but he thinks he remembers a specific spike agony, one that rippled underneath his skin. After that there isn\u2019t much else. When things come back to him it\u2019s because something odd has reminded him of it. And then the knowledge, like it did earlier, spills out of his mouth without him entirely noticing while it happens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Bucky digs up one of his many talents. He turns on his smile and lies. \u201cJeez, you getting dense, Rogers? We know the man\u2019s a scientist. Doctor. Doesn\u2019t matter. We know he\u2019s in that profession, and it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all for him to be sent out on a political trip, does it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d agrees Steve. He shakes his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you been sleeping?\u201d asks Bucky. He feels terrible about it, absolutely terrible, but that doesn\u2019t stop him. It\u2019s a distraction. He feels in a visceral and gut-churning way that he needs to distract Steve. Sick with himself he puts a hand on Steve\u2019s arm and squeezes. He can\u2019t stop himself from doing it. It\u2019s strangely instinctual. \u201cYou gotta get your rest, Steve. It\u2019s a big one coming up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve agrees, and gives him his sweet smile. Bucky feels awful. He feels absolutely godawful. \u201cYeah, of course; you\u2019re right, Buck. I\u2019m sorry about all that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cNo harm, no foul.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve tells him goodnight and to sleep well, and he heads on off. Bucky wanders over to the barracks, a little more slowly. Over his raggedy shirt Bucky presses his fingers to where the bullet wound was. He\u2019s already taken the dressing off. It\u2019s been six days and he can\u2019t even feel a twinge. He pokes at it. There won\u2019t be any scar, he already knows. Just that weird newborn pink skin in a little circle where the slug went inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Bucky calls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve turns. His hair is gold in the low yellow light and his face is wide open. Bucky\u2019s vision goes double for a second as he remembers how Steve was before, that tiny asshole kid with his too-big nose and huge blue eyes overlaid on Steve now: six feet tall, strong as an ox. Bucky waits in the moment just long enough to feel it settle. Steve\u2019s eyes on him is one thing that doesn\u2019t ever get old. Bucky aches for him all the way down to the meat of his soul. It breaks his heart sometimes, just looking at Steve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep well, alright?\u201d Bucky says, and means it this time.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s mouth tilts in a tired smile. \u201cYou too, Buck,\u201d he says, and the warm low tone of his voice is the only thing that gets Bucky back to his cot in one entire piece. He feels it in him tonight \u2014 the noise in his head. He figures he\u2019s got enough time before lights out to get it down on paper. This big swell in his heart. He won\u2019t have time, not once they\u2019ve got their orders for marching. While he lights up a cigarette and makes his way back to the barracks he lets his mind wander, aimless. By the time he gets a pen out his smoke is halfway gone. He\u2019s almost at the end of this little leather-bound journal, too. He takes a drag of his cigarette, and thinks, the way he does so much, about Steve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky puts his pen to the paper and writes, <em>There are a bunch of stories in this world.</em></p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>I guess we didn\u2019t know what to expect from the Russians, but when you looked at them and examined them, you couldn\u2019t tell whether, you know?

I spent one month scared as hell that you were going to stop breathing and then two weeks worrying that the next time you coughed there\u2019d be blood in your hand, and you\u2019d be gone from me just like that, same way as your mama before you, God rest her soul. I didn\u2019t think I could stand it, having to bury you. Even now I\u2019d rather eat my own gun than see you dead.</p>\n<p>I hate them. I hate them for what they did to you. You won\u2019t ever understand that, I don\u2019t think. I mean, sure, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re finally in one piece and I don\u2019t have to worry about a strong wind knocking you over. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t have bad lungs and that it doesn\u2019t hurt when you walk for too long. The outside finally matches the inside, and now everyone \u2014 the whole world, I guess \u2014 can see just what it is you\u2019re made of. I\u2019m not mad about that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s selfish maybe but I didn\u2019t want you out here. When I shipped out I kept thinking, at least he\u2019s stowed away safe. I even thought, when I get myself killed out there, maybe it\u2019ll convince him to stop trying to get in. And that was the one good thing I had in my head every time I was listening to enemy fire, convinced I wasn\u2019t making the march back. So what if you volunteered, like you said. You\u2019ve always been your own. The one thing you\u2019ve always been, hell or high water, is your own. Can\u2019t deny you that. I would never try besides. But you\u2019re going to see killing, these next couple days. You\u2019re going to see the truth of the world, and the hell that lives inside. So answer me this, and be honest now: Isn\u2019t that just trading out one sickness for another?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>II.<br> They fucked me up, but I don\u2019t ever wanna tell you just how bad. I won\u2019t even now, don\u2019t even want to think those things in your direction. But I will tell you \u2014 mostly because God willing you\u2019ll never see these \u2014 I will tell you that when you first came for me I thought, hand to the Lord, that I was finally dead. And then I figured it was just another trick. They did that, made me think you were there. They\u2019d shoot me up with something, and after I felt it slide through my veins under my skin I would see you, or I\u2019d hear you, and I\u2019d say your name the way I used to. You know what I mean \u2014 that nickname you hated, the one I still sometimes say just to rile you up because you\u2019re amazing when I piss you off, your face all red like that, something about the fact that I can get your heart going.</p>\n<p>But that name, I\u2019d say it over and over. Up until I realized that they were back to their old drill, asking how\u2019s that feel, does it hurt when I cut here? How about the sole of his foot next? And then I\u2019d go back to it, name, rank, serial number. You wouldn\u2019t believe all the German I learned on that table. It was a God damn language lesson.</p>\n<p>And now I\u2019m trekking around with you, killing anyone who\u2019s got a swastika on and looks at you wrong, and I\u2019ll tell you, my feet bled for three days straight after you came to get me, and I didn\u2019t once feel a thing.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like this. You were the best at mythology when we were kids, and I remember one day we were reading about Icarus. And you remember this, I know you do, but I\u2019m going to tell you the story again anyway. Icarus made wings out of wax to escape a prison. But when he was outside for the first time in years there was the sun hanging up in the sky above him and he thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He flew closer and closer and his wings started to melt, but he didn\u2019t give a good goddamn. He kept flying up until he couldn\u2019t fly anymore, and his eyes were probably burning, and his skin was probably burning, but still he didn\u2019t care. And then his wings melted all the way and he fell miles and miles into the ocean and brained himself on a rock, that poor stupid asshole. And I\u2019ll tell you what: I\u2019m no better. I\u2019m no fucking better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>III.<br> You piss me off so God damn much. Jesus Roosevelt Christ. I\u2019ve got your number, you reckless fucking dumbass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>IV.<br> This is the God\u2019s honest truth: I hated that asshole. With his big pearly whites and his spit-shined uniform \u2014 what kind of sorry schmuck lets somebody dress him up like that? \u2014 prancing around in his tights and acting like he knows what it means to lay in the mud for six days straight, what it feels like when the enemy\u2019s got too close and the only thing left to do is close your hands around their neck and lock your muscles up and wait until the life snuffs out.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve done that. You\u2019ve seen me.</p>\n<p>One kid, just a little after I shipped out, not even three months in, he showed up back from leave with the comic books. I laughed in his God damn face. I ain\u2019t proud of it, but I did. I was sore and tired and couldn\u2019t get that smell out of my nose, like car parts on a hot day at the garage. Felt like I was bathing in it. Still do. Blood doesn\u2019t wash out, no matter what they tell you. Not even cold water can do it. So anyway I\u2019m standing there in my boots that are getting holes in them and I\u2019m reeking like the cold mud and shit and whatever the hell else I\u2019d been stepping in, and this green kid settles down by the fire, his eyes too big for his face the way yours used to be, his uniform all clean, and he pulls out this comic book. I about lost it right then. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to yell or cry or sock him one, but it was like there was a huge rushing in my ears and I couldn\u2019t think past the anger. Right then all I could think was of that kid\u2019s body laying on the ground, his eyes staring sightless and bloodshot up at mine. I didn\u2019t want that thought to belong to me. I hated thinking it, but I couldn\u2019t make the image go away. In the end I reigned it in; you\u2019d be proud. All I said was, that mook doesn\u2019t give a shit about you, pal. He\u2019s never fought in a war and he never will.</p>\n<p>And Jesus Christ, how\u2019s that for irony?</p>\n<p>But later I felt like shit and apologized, and even later that kid got his arm blown off by a Kraut hand grenade and was shipped back home. So whatever that says. War stories don\u2019t really have much by way of morals or lessons, but I figured I\u2019d tell it anyway.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t still hate him, or at least not the same way that I used to. How could I? It\u2019s impossible. Got his patch sewn on my left arm and everything. And I\u2019ll wear it, too, until the day I die. I\u2019ll tell you, I should have appreciated that comic book while I had the God damn chance. I was stupid then. The colors in it were so bright and vivid, so much nicer than the gray and green we\u2019ve got here. But when he got carted out of the field he had his comic books in his pack and they shipped home with him. So all that color he brought is back home, now. Which is alright. I figure that\u2019s where those types of happy things belong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>V.<br> What do you say, after this I\u2019ll take you someplace nice, and I\u2019m not talking about one of the dance halls you hate so bad either. It\u2019s so God damn cold in Brooklyn your lungs make a louder racket than our broken radiator and Mister Eli\u2019s mangy cat combined, and then here mud sucks at our shoes and gets under my fingernails and I swear to God that I haven\u2019t felt warm in half a year. Neither have you, no matter how hard you pretend otherwise.</p>\n<p>So if we ever get out of this frozen wet hell we\u2019re going out to the Grand Canyon. I tell you, I dream of the Grand Canyon. We\u2019ll be there at night, just you and me, and throw rocks off the edge to hear them make land a thousand miles down, thunking like fat little raindrops into a puddle. That\u2019s all I want to do anymore. Lay on the baked red ground next to you until my bones heat up. Warm again. Warm again with no more of that thick dried blood smell in my nose, just you, clean like your soap. You\u2019d be heaven for anyone, but you\u2019re especially heaven for a sinner like me. And even if we freeze where we lay like that Nazi splinter group we found \u2014 I heard the desert gets real cold at night, or maybe you told me that \u2014 at least it\u2019ll be because we wanted to be there, and at least the air will be dry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>VI.<br> I saw it \u2014 did you know that? I did. You\u2019ve always been sentimental in stupid ways, can never say it out loud, always got to find a different way to show it. I get it, you know. I do. Hell, I did almost the same thing with your letters before I lost them, keeping them tucked up in my pocket every time I was out in the field. And isn\u2019t that a riot and a half?</p>\n<p>Maybe you think about it like a good luck charm. Or maybe you just like to see her pretty face \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t blame you. I\u2019d like her for myself if it wasn\u2019t plain as day to me the way you are about her. Remember what your ma used to say? \u201cGone in the head.\u201d Well that\u2019s what you are. If there wasn\u2019t a war on you two would already be living upstate in some real nice brownstone with two dogs and a kid. As it is, when the two of you get out of this alive, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll end up anyway. Don\u2019t be nervous about it. She\u2019ll say yes. She\u2019d say yes if you asked right now. She\u2019d wear a God damn ring from a Cracker Jack box if it was all you had, trust me on that. She\u2019s your forever girl.</p>\n<p>At least those are the things I\u2019m gonna tell you the night before you propose, nervous and pacing and wanting to practice on me. Then again, maybe I won\u2019t live to see it. Sometimes I hope to God I won\u2019t. When it comes right down to it I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be able to do it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve got it in me; I don\u2019t know if I can just stand there while you seal the deal. I\u2019m no good at watching you walk away from me.</p>\n<p>You know, after the table, when they took me in to question me about what happened, they gave me an out. They told me they\u2019d discharge me and I could go home \u2014 I\u2019m serious. Due to psychological injury, they said. Do you understand that? I think about it every God damn day of my life. I could have gone home. I could be home right now. I could be sitting in our ugly little shoebox trying to get the radiator to work. I could be at the fish market, or even taking a girl on a date. But God fucking save me, I couldn\u2019t do it. My one dream came true but I didn\u2019t take it because I didn\u2019t want to watch you leave. Not quite yet. I\u2019m selfish and I want to hang on until I can\u2019t anymore.</p>\n<p>The God\u2019s honest truth is that I ain\u2019t ever gonna love again. She\u2019s your true north. I know what that means, because you\u2019re mine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>VII.<br> You scare the hell out of me. Every hour of every God damn day. You scare me to fucking death.</p>\n<p>I have a theory, a theory about war, and it works like this \u2014 all of us, whether we enlisted or hit the lottery, we tell ourselves stories about why we\u2019re out here. Some guys who get the draft say it\u2019s God\u2019s plan for them, and some guys who enlist say they\u2019re doin it for Uncle Sam or their sweethearts or their mamas, or maybe even their shellshocked daddies.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t come to war for you and I didn\u2019t fight to keep it away. The way I got out here was cowardly. But the more I fought the more I told myself my story. It\u2019s so much easier when you\u2019re telling yourself a story. Because the truth is that we\u2019re not here for God or for our nation or even for our families or our sweethearts. Maybe we think so at first or we convince ourselves afterwards, which is easy enough to do when you\u2019re humping through the muck or trying not to catch hypothermia in the forest. In the field it\u2019s a different story. Suddenly all the pretty pictures you\u2019ve painted fade away and all that\u2019s left is the ugly gore and the sweat. It turns out that there\u2019s not one God damn thing that\u2019s glorious about death. You\u2019re not out here for them. You\u2019re out here because that\u2019s just the way the chips fell.</p>\n<p>I told you, you heard me: I told you never to follow me into Hell. Now I\u2019m not vain enough to think that\u2019s why you\u2019re out here now \u2014 if there\u2019s any person in what\u2019s left of this God forsaken planet who\u2019s part of a bigger picture, it\u2019d be you. But I\u2019ll keep saying it until it sticks. You got nothing to prove. I\u2019m not worth much, I damn well know that, but I\u2019ll ask you anyway: Stay for me. If you leave me alone in this world I\u2019ll turn into something terrible. I\u2019ll turn into the nasty creature that\u2019s growing inside me. This war, it\u2019ll swallow me whole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>VIII.<br> If I close my eyes I can pretend I\u2019m back home, except there\u2019s maybe not so many horns honking. It\u2019s better than being on the front, though. Hell of a lot better than that.</p>\n<p>Remember on the real hot days when we used to dangle our legs off the dock? At around four o\u2019clock the hot dog stand shaded us until sundown. I was peeled and blistered and burned from working all day out in the sun anyway, but I didn\u2019t want to go to the apartment because it wasn\u2019t often you\u2019d get out. You were always so careful when you brought your sketchbook for drawing, making sure not to drop it in, but everything you drew those days ended up getting sprayed a little by the waves anyway. There must be a million drawings of me and the landscape there that\u2019s smudged in tiny circles the shape of the water droplets.</p>\n<p>I remember one year, when we first got a place, the kid in the apartment below us \u2014 really just a kid \u2014 he died in the night from the fever that was taking everyone in the neighborhood. And you were so damn upset, all hunched over, red around the eyes. I slung my arm around you and said a bunch of bullshit nonsense about how it was fine and at least he didn\u2019t hurt anymore. But then I put my face in your hair and thanked God it was him and not you. I thought, if He had to take someone, at least it wasn\u2019t you. It was the worst thing I ever thought but it\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>Tell you a secret? One month out a guy got hurt bad in a shelling. Reminded me of that sick kid downstairs, the same hair, you remember \u2014 curly? Just like then there wasn\u2019t nothing I could have done to help him. His belly looked like Swiss cheese from all the shrapnel. Fell down next to me. There was no saving him, and he was staring right at me \u2014 it\u2019s not like I could leave him there, not when he was looking like that. He said please, and so I shot him in the face. I was glad when he was done wheezing and gasping. I was so damn glad: I didn\u2019t have to listen to it anymore. So maybe that\u2019s the worst thing I ever thought, now that I remember it.</p>\n<p>Water\u2019s different here. It mists off the Thames, and by night I half expect the air to freeze while I try to walk through it. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d dip my feet in, or want you to. And what\u2019s there to draw? Can\u2019t even see Big Ben or any of that from where we are. Everything\u2019s so gray, I miss the big red burns I\u2019d get that made me have to sleep on my belly for weeks on end. I don\u2019t think you could ever really stay out long enough to get a burn that way but I remember that your nose would get it bad and turn all red and peel a little on the bridge of it. I thought that was funny as hell. Sweet. I don\u2019t know why, but it was. Bet you don\u2019t even burn now. That\u2019s a good thing, I keep telling myself. In this world of bad things that\u2019s one really good thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>IX.<br> You remember staying up late reading Dracula out loud to each other under the covers, back when your ma was still alive? And we were havin the best time, scaring ourselves like a couple of idiots, until all of a sudden a police siren started up outside and we both screamed fit to wake the people in West Virginia. Then your ma came flying down the hall with a bread knife of all things at the ready, and she made us turn out the lights. So we did, and then of course I tried to act all tough, but I slept next to you that night anyway. Funny, I guess. Turns out that you\u2019re still my favorite hiding place. Funny, too: turns out there are scarier things in the dark than vampires.</p>\n<p>Tell you something. Tell you another secret, because this one, this one I won\u2019t ever tell, not to God, not to a priest, and sure as hell not to you. In that base we burned the bodies in a furnace. I hadn\u2019t eaten in days. The truth is simple. The smell made me hungry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>X.<br> There\u2019s this feeling I get after a firefight, when the shells are still bouncing across the ground, and I\u2019m still a little blind and deaf, but the whole world is crystal clear, and I could just fall to the ground and cry like a baby because I\u2019m still alive. The first time I felt it I thought I was going to burst out of my skin. And then everything rushed back so quick I felt like a newborn. The whole world was brand-new and I was on top of it. I could swallow it whole.</p>\n<p>You think I haven\u2019t seen the same look on your face?</p>\n<p>The closest I\u2019ve ever been to the Garden of Eden is the genesis on the battlefield when the shrapnel\u2019s still falling like hail on a tin roof. You look at me with those blue eyes all hot and electric in your face, blood on your cheek, soot smudged over your nose. Bone of my bones. Were you taken from my rib? You must have been, or maybe I was made from yours. And God damn, I want it. I want back inside you. I want you now, same as I wanted you before, prettier than hell even with a bloodied nose and split knuckles. Don\u2019t care you were smaller. Liked it, even \u2014 same as I like you this way too. You make me hungry. You understand? You make me hungry. That mouth pink like spun sugar, though it doesn\u2019t stop you from talking fit to cut anyone down to bits with your angry words. A spitfire since you learned how to speak, and I\u2019ll tell you something, it\u2019s hell to love a fighter.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Jesus \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t even be thinking it, much less writing it down. I used to love you so sweet, the way kids love, the way I was supposed to. Then it turned greedy and true. If there\u2019s any Heaven that\u2019s fit for me it\u2019d be all your pale skin under my hands for the rest of eternity. I wouldn\u2019t need anything else. Not food or drink or sleep. Just my hands on you and your sweet love-sounds.</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s fit I take it to the grave. Wouldn\u2019t make you any happier. In fact it\u2019d do nothing but put you in danger \u2014 that ain\u2019t something I want. It\u2019s another story I tell myself, I guess. That I\u2019m being noble and doing it for you, when really I\u2019m just being scared, and can\u2019t do it to myself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>XI.<br> Here\u2019s a story your mama told me.</p>\n<p>When she came over on the boat she kept getting sick and she couldn\u2019t figure out why. Eventually this lady came up to see if she was fine, and she asked her, when are you due? And your ma said, no, I\u2019m only seasick.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m supposed to take the rest of this story to the grave, but I doubt anyone will care to find these anyway.</p>\n<p>So it turned out the woman from the Old Country was right, and your ma cried herself sick because she was so scared and alone. You see now why I was supposed to take this one to the grave? She asks the woman, the hell will I do? I don\u2019t have any money and nobody on God\u2019s green Earth will hire an Irish girl fresh off the ship, especially when she\u2019s in a family way. Now the woman, she was feeling terrible about this, terrible for this young girl who had nowhere else to turn. And the woman\u2019s husband, he\u2019d died in the war. So she slipped off the band around her finger and put it on your mama\u2019s. Then she told your ma her last name, and her husband\u2019s first name, and said it was time to start over again anyway. So your ma did. She bought a plot at the cemetery and said it was your da's. That grave is empty, same way mine will be. That rosary you got with you, the one you think is his -- it was hers. It was hers all along.</p>\n<p>After she finished whispering it out to me, the whole truth of her life, she started hacking up a lung. I got her water, I remember, and then I asked \u2014 well, what anyone else would, I guess. I asked why she did it. Why she picked me to tell. She looked me in the eye and she said, remember how she used to call me, she said, \u201cJames Buchanan, I\u2019m not long for this Earth. I told you because I know. You and me; you and me, James, we\u2019re the same kind of storyteller.\u201d</p>\n<p>I still don\u2019t understand what it was that she knew. I got my suspicions. I think she saw in me the thief and impostor she saw in herself. We understood one another, your ma and I. I was a good kid, back home \u2014 straight A\u2019s till I dropped out, good at my job, good to my dates, a gentleman. I was so proud of those things, and turns out it don\u2019t matter at all. Even though you were the troublemaker we were both from the wrong side of the tracks. Brooklyn tough, and no changing us \u2014 do anything for each other, won\u2019t we? I\u2019ve stolen and lied and cheated, and mostly, I\u2019ve done it for you. Not because you asked \u2014 you didn\u2019t ask your ma either, and you would never ask anyone, considering you\u2019d choke on your pride if you ever tried swallowing it. But like me, she did it for you all the same.</p>\n<p>She told me that at first she was scared as hell of loving you. She said she didn\u2019t know if she could, because she thought she\u2019d always be waiting for you to die, and she couldn\u2019t stand anyone else dyin on her. I finally bucked up and asked her how long she had actually loved you for. You know what she told me? She said, that\u2019s a stupid question.</p>\n<p>She died in the night while we slept in our beds. I heard the news first, because I guess I was just up and out first, taking her bread, or soup, or something. All I saw of her was her white hand while they took her away. I remember walking all the way back to your apartment, hadn\u2019t seen you in maybe a day and a half, and I knew I had to tell you but I also knew I didn\u2019t want to. So I let myself in, quiet as a mouse, and sure enough you were still asleep in bed. All I could do was look at you and wish to God that I could put a spin on this one, too \u2014 make it all alright again.</p>\n<p>At the end she was so tired.</p>\n<p>Never really thought about the future. Never really could think much past you. In that respect, your ma and I had something in common, God rest her soul. But neither of us, I don\u2019t think, were ever meant for much. Here\u2019s the truth \u2014 baby, here\u2019s the truth. I\u2019ve got a rootless heart. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m meant for loving, or at least not anymore. And I should die out here. I\u2019m the kind of guy who\u2019s not meant to go back. I try to imagine a life after this and it just won\u2019t come. So forget about me, will you? If it\u2019ll make you happy. Live glorious, eat like a king, laugh until the sun comes up, never look back. Don\u2019t you dare look back. More than anything I want to know that you kept on. More than anything I want to know that you took on the world \u2014 everything else seems to matter less and less.</p>\n<p>So how long have I loved you for? Womb to tomb, sweetheart. Since before I was even here at all. I get it now, you understand. Your ma was right. It really is a stupid question.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>XII.<br> Look, I\u2019m sorry I worried you so bad. I\u2019m just fine, except maybe now you know how I felt last year, when you almost bled out under my hands while I stood there like some kind of helpless schmuck, not having the first God damn idea what to do. I don\u2019t remember a whole lot about the ordeal, but I do remember you shoving your belt between my teeth. I remember I wasn\u2019t allowed to make a lick of noise due to how far behind enemy lines we were, and I remember trying like hell not to. It hurt, sure. Hurt like the Devil himself was digging down and trying to pull out my insides.</p>\n<p>I remember after it was over you pressing your forehead against mine. You didn\u2019t say a word but I knew you were afraid. I shut my eyes and for a second I could pretend I was back in Brooklyn. I pretended that our faces were too close because we were sharing a bed in the middle of winter and you had rolled over in your sleep. I swear to God, in that second I could smell the charcoal on your hands from drawing all day, and the motor oil on my skin from working at the garage. When you let out a breath I could even smell the sharp sweet tang of oranges.</p>\n<p>Right then I didn\u2019t tell myself any stories. I was dying, and I was glad that it was happening while I was next to you.</p>\n<p>You know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told you the whole story before. It\u2019s like everything started around that winter. Like I orbit it, sucked into that year by some big cosmic force of gravity.</p>\n<p>It was 1940, the year you kept almost dying on me, but this was before all that. Winter was just coming, and the cough you had was only little, not keeping you in bed for weeks at a time. I knew that even if I couldn\u2019t pay for heat I had to pay at least for some more blankets or quilts. I remember thinking that even if I could steal food I\u2019d need money for your medications.</p>\n<p>It was when I got laid off from the garage, and the factory jobs had run out in Brooklyn and Queens \u2014 I think this part you know. I went all over Manhattan, but no one in Midtown wanted to hire me. Finally I ended up at a deli and I flattered the old fella behind the counter with some bullshit I can\u2019t even remember now, maybe how great their cheesecake was, but anyway he finally let me in on a few trade secrets about who around town was looking for help. Anyway, I got the gig at the docks in Chelsea. It was only part time and eventually I had to replace it with the dock job back home, but it was alright money while I could get it. I worked maybe five hours that day, and on the way back to our rickety place I was feeling so lucky I stopped by the market. If you were a dame I probably would have tried to buy you a ring. I could have taken on the whole world because I had the dollar fifty in my pocket they paid me for working on such short notice. It was the first real money I felt like I\u2019d had in years.</p>\n<p>So I was walking around the market, looking around, dried this, canned that\u2026and then I saw some oranges. Heavenly choirs sang when I looked at those oranges. They were so bright and I\u2019d just worked a hard, cold shift, and you had been looking blue and sick for weeks. And all of a sudden the inspiration struck me, and I knew what I had to do.</p>\n<p>I swear to God I haggled with Mr. O\u2019Leary over that one single orange for fifteen minutes straight. There was something important to me that day about buying it with the money I\u2019d just made. Finally I got it low enough.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll never forget the look on your face when I came in the door and tossed it to you. I can\u2019t even describe it. I\u2019d do anything on earth to make you look at me again like that. I\u2019d fill your whole room up with oranges. I\u2019d fill the apartment with them. The building, even. Give them to you in baskets until the day I die and arrange for them to be sent even after that.</p>\n<p>Well, then of course you started worrying over the price and wouldn\u2019t hear of eating it all on your own. So you made me split it with you. I can still taste it \u2014 the way it broke so sweet and tart on my tongue, got sticky all over my fingers. Do you remember, we even kept squeezing the skin because little bursts of flavor would puff out away from it that we could see and smell. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tasted anything like that before or since. It was like a whole summer feast laid out right in front of us, even though it was just one fruit and not summer at all, but instead that terrible time of year when winter sneaks down; starts killing the flowers.</p>\n<p>Never told another soul this, and I guess I never will, but I think of that orange, that one evening, every single time when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m about to snuff it for real. Thought about it in my first firefight and thought about it when the Germans stuck me full of needles and sliced up the soles of my feet. And when I was shot the other day and so sure it was over \u2014 good-bye, motherfuckers, I\u2019m finally going back home \u2014 I wasn\u2019t all that scared. In that one minute it was fine \u2014 everything was alright. I bought an orange. You smiled at me. And Jesus Christ, it was fantastic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>XIII.<br> There are a bunch of stories in this world. I know this because I slept through every single one of them in school with you snoring away right beside me. Long stories, short stories, ghost stories. Sad stories and romance stories, parables, tall tales, and even the stories that have happy endings \u2014 And let me tell you, men on Mars make more sense to me than those do these days.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m the story that\u2019ll never get told, but that doesn\u2019t much bother me. They\u2019ll remember you which is as it should be. Just like me, they were caught off guard. Nobody ever saw you coming, not the army, not the country. You went and blindsided us all. And now that all the storytellers have got a hold of you, you\u2019re gonna live forever.</p>\n<p>I remember maybe third day of Catechism when Sister Catherine said that each and every one of us are sinners and there wasn\u2019t nothing to be done for it. And I believe it of me, hell yes I do \u2014 I\u2019m a killer, stone cold. Some people are good at math and some people are good at art, but me, I\u2019m good at shooting, and it scares me right to the bone the things I\u2019d do for you. When they turn me away from the pearly gates I imagine they\u2019ll give me a list full of the names of the Germans I killed for you and won\u2019t look twice at what I think about doing every time I curl up around you at night, sayin it\u2019s just to keep warm. Because it\u2019s fine and all to kill for your country, I think, but not quite the same when you\u2019re killing for just one person in particular.</p>\n<p>And besides, I\u2019ve got a whole laundry list of other sins, past even those. I\u2019m a liar and a coward, and once I got the draft I burned the letter so that you\u2019d never find it. I\u2019m so God damn afraid to die, but it\u2019s not for me. It\u2019s because I can\u2019t leave you alone in a world as ugly as this one. Somehow you don\u2019t know it, but there\u2019s no justice here, not anymore. All the word about the death camps. The shit Morita put up with before he shipped out. You took a knife to the neck last year and still you can\u2019t see it, don\u2019t understand that Hell isn\u2019t some place underneath us, all filled up with fire and brimstone. Hell is right here, and I\u2019ve been damned for a long time.</p>\n<p>I know you\u2019re not alone without me anymore. You\u2019ve got your girl and you\u2019ve got the boys. I know you can take care of yourself, and it puts me at a loose ends, how you can keep safe on your own now. You don\u2019t need me. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not still afraid for you, not scared shitless that this world is gonna eat you alive.</p>\n<p>But at least now I understand, I think, the feeling you had when you talked about doing right by your country, because I don\u2019t mind living in Hell if it means doing right by you, just the way I\u2019d strip the boots off a million dead Nazis if it meant your feet staying warm and dry.</p>\n<p>I see you worrying your daddy's rosary at night, the poor battered old thing, and I wonder how you can still pray. I went to confession a hundred times until I gave up on it, because no matter how many Hail Marys I recited in the dark with you laying next to me, it didn\u2019t stop. Sister Catherine would spit on me because I don\u2019t have much need for God out here, but I\u2019m glad you do. I\u2019m real glad one of us does. But you keep giving me those big sad eyes of yours, like I\u2019m breakin your heart when I try to explain it to you, and so I\u2019ll give it another go, just one last try, even if you\u2019ll never know about it \u2014</p>\n<p>Ave Maria, gratia plena, get him out of this war, and if you\u2019ve gotta take someone then take me, because I\u2019ve got nothing real to go home to but he\u2019s got a girl now and I can see the hope written all over his face when he sees her. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, pray for us sinners, but don\u2019t spend too much time on my immortal soul, because not even divine intervention can help me now. I know when to walk away from a fight and trying my damnedest not to need him was a losing battle.</p>\n<p>I won\u2019t be in the history books; that\u2019s for you. But I loved you first. As long as they get that right, I don\u2019t care what they say.</p>"
