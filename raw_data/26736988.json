  "text": "<p>\u201cDreeeeeam,\u201d George protests for the umpteenth time tonight, \u201cStop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream continues anyway, hitting George playfully in game as he attempts to collect food.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. Not until you admit it.\u201d The man in question drawls out happily, still prancing around and not leaving George to his task.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I\u2019m <i>soooo</i> much taller than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>George retaliates, hitting Dream as he snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not <i>soooo</i> much taller than me,\u201d He points out, mimicking Dream\u2019s tone, \u201cOnly by, like, a couple inches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore like a couple feet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d George whines, turning to his monitor currently displaying TeamSpeak as if he\u2019ll be able to stare down it to glare at Dream\u2019s real face.</p>\n<p>How they\u2019d got onto this topic, he doesn\u2019t even know. George just knows that Dream <i>really</i> likes that fact that he\u2019s taller than him, and for the unspoken record, maybe George secretly does too. </p>\n<p>Dream breaks him out of his trail of thought by asking, \u201cI wonder how much bigger one of my hoodies would be on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says it nonchalantly. As if George is able to respond to that in a normal person way. </p>\n<p>In the end, he settles on joking, \u201cSend me one then.\u201d As he powers on with his game.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Is all Dream says in return.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDREAM,\u201d George exclaims, admittedly rather loudly, down their now connected Discord call, \u201cI was <i>joking</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears a small, stifled laugh down the mic before Dream answers him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>George can only sigh again as he glances back down to the half-opened package in his hands. The label indicating that it had come from America had highly stimulated George\u2019s curiosity as to what it contained. </p>\n<p>He\u2019d briefly considered that maybe it was a part for his PC he\u2019d ordered that he\u2019d forgot about, but upon carrying it back home from the post office, he\u2019d soon found out that it was definitely too soft for that. </p>\n<p>When he\u2019d got home and split the edge of the package open carefully, as soon as George had seen the soft fabric and hood of a jumper he\u2019d just known what had happened. <i>Dream</i> had happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to go all the way to the post office to collect this, as well,\u201d George continues complaining, mainly to himself, as he pulls the rest of the hoodie out of its packaging, \u201cHow long did it take to arrive? Like, two weeks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream wheezes out of the speakers of George\u2019s setup.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for ages for it to arrive. I even paid for express delivery.\u201d The other man sounds strangely proud of himself for doing so.</p>\n<p>George finally untangles it all and chucks the packaging to the side for now. Holding the pale blue jumper up in the view of the camera he\u2019d now turned on for Dream to see, George suddenly realises how big it actually is.</p>\n<p>Hiding his expression of surprise behind the jumper from the camera, George mentally admits to himself that maybe Dream <i>is</i> so much taller than him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d </p>\n<p>George laughs out, laying the soft fabric across his lap. It\u2019s not until he brings it away from his face, that George realises the hoodie has a particular smell. His brain that quickly follows this with the realisation that this is probably what Dream smells like. </p>\n<p>He desperately resists the strong urge to lift the material back up to his nose; missing the warm scent of ambrosial sandalwood that had ambushed him beforehand.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot kidding,\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream sing-songs back to him playfully, tone excited.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of my favourites, George. Be careful with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Feeling pressure suddenly hanging over him, George\u2019s voice jumps higher as he exclaims, \u201cWhy would you send me one of your favourites?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream helpfully answers, remaining silent after until George glances down at the jumper again before looking directly down the camera lens, giving him a death stare. The other man lets out a free laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon then,\u201d He urges, \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p>\n<p>George makes a face when he brings the jumper up to his nose to dramatically sniff and teases him, \u201cDid you even wash this, Dream?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, it\u2019s Dream\u2019s turn to whine out a protest of \u2018shut up\u2019. George forces himself to maintain a mildly disgusted face for the camera when, in reality, the scent from Dream\u2019s hoodie is perhaps one of the most inviting and safest he has ever encountered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I did. Now c\u2019mon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s tone is still whiny, dragging out the last syllable until George interrupts with an exclamation of, \u201cOkay, okay!\u201d</p>\n<p>Practically able to hear the large grin in Dream\u2019s chuckles as he moves to take his own hoodie off, George can\u2019t stop himself from smiling widely at the sound in return. Somehow he manages to get his arms all twisted up and stuck in the material as he attempts to pull it off. </p>\n<p>Dream teases him, as always, \u201cDelaying the inevitable result are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>George just tuts at this man\u2019s ridiculous determination to prove the extent of his height and it\u2019s difference to his own; he has gone to great lengths to demonstrate his point, though, he must admit.</p>\n<p>Finally, George manages to let his head pop free, taking an exaggerated breath of fresh cool air that makes Dream laugh and forget his question.</p>\n<p>Perhaps a little too belatedly, however, he realises that during his vigorous struggle with his his own hoodie, his white, cotton t-shirt underneath has managed to ride up so high that it\u2019s definitely visible on camera to Dream, exposing a considerable expanse of George\u2019s pale skin.</p>\n<p>If the other man notices, he luckily doesn\u2019t comment. George sheepishly pulls the fabric back down, covering the full length of his torso, and knows he blushes a deep red.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, George.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream encourages him, but this time it\u2019s softer and more supportive; it\u2019s not doing anything to alleviate the stark colour of George\u2019s cheeks.</p>\n<p>He moves further back from his desk to give himself more room this time and to open up the camera angle a little more. </p>\n<p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m doing it.\u201d George answers, sounding rather begrudging, but actually secretly feeling quite excited to wear something of <i>Dream\u2019s</i>.</p>\n<p>Sliding the loose material over his head, George suddenly realises that they\u2019re now technically closer than they have ever been to each other. Slipping his arms into the definitely too-long sleeves feels like a warm embrace, saving him from the winter chill of his room despite the heating of his apartment being cranked up to \u2018high\u2019.</p>\n<p>A large amount of the soft fabric of the baby-blue hoodie bunches at George\u2019s slender waist. Getting out of his chair to feel the full effect of the length, he almost forgets about Dream\u2019s presence altogether until he hears a soft gasp emitted from his speakers.</p>\n<p>Suddenly intrigued, George squints at the display of him in his room on his screen, pushing his chair further to the side and away from him in the process. His eyes widen slightly in surprise at what he sees.</p>\n<p>The pale-blue material of the jumper seems to drape lavishly over him, rolling in waves of somber sea and drowning him in its sheer length. Blue sleeves cascade long past the position of George\u2019s actual hands; bunching them up a little to emerge his skin, he quickly finds that he doesn\u2019t want to, discovering comfort in the warm, fluffy interior. Instead, he reveals only his fingertips to the cool air and wraps them around the ends of the sleeves creating sweater paws.</p>\n<p>Falling around his mid thigh, the hem of Dream\u2019s hoodie nearly stretches far enough to conceal the fact that he\u2019s even wearing shorts altogether; his pale thighs on show to the camera and complimentary to the pastel hue of the warm fabric.</p>\n<p>George studies himself for a few seconds more before an involuntary, shy smile blooms across his face, fingers still playing with the hems of the sleeves and shifting side-to-side on his feet, rather nervously. </p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge, you look...\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s voice is finally heard again, crackling through the speakers this time, still breathless and hushed. George waits for the inevitably tame insult though, because that\u2019s their <i>thing</i> that\u2019s what they do.</p>\n<p><i>Stupid</i>, maybe. <i>Silly</i>? Or maybe even a simple and straight to the point, <i>small</i>.</p>\n<p>None of these words fly out of Dream\u2019s mouth however. Instead, \u201cYou look <i>cute</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>George is pretty sure he loses his breath; he\u2019s known Dream for years and his tone is honest and serious. He\u2019s not teasing, or even being affectionate in a way that close, close friends do. Consequently, he flushes bright and prominent red, much to his embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cDreeeam,\u201d He persists, attempting to cover his blush in his hands, \u201cYou-don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018Don\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean.\u2019 George wants to say, but his words aren\u2019t cooperating right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m being honest!\u201d </p>\n<p>Dream maintains, voice now higher at the accusation than the previous, almost intimate tone. It soon returns.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge-,\u201d His breathlessness is back too, \u201cI can\u2019t- You look adorable in my hoodie.\u201d</p>\n<p>George is still blushing furiously, and has to resort to looking at the floor, begging the warmth in his cheeks to go away. He feels like he should say something, so he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to reply in a timid voice, not sure of the correct reaction to receiving a compliment of such nature.</p>\n<p>Dream chuckles lightly before going quiet for a more few seconds, seemingly considering something before reaching a decision.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it comfy, <i>baby</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s George\u2019s turn to gasp audibly because Oh. My. God.</p>\n<p>Sure, they\u2019ve all used such nicknames in a joking way with each other before, but not in this capacity and context. It\u2019s so much different and it definitely <i>does</i> something to George... he even thinks he <i>likes</i> it.</p>\n<p>Currently presenting himself to Dream over call, standing in nothing really more than the other man\u2019s hoodie that absolutely engulfs his smaller and slender frame, coupled with the addition of a freaking pet name, George feels, as he so often does with Dream, vulnerable yet safe and completely and utterly cared for in every way. And he loves it.</p>\n<p>In order to attempt to get this point across, George makes sure to maintain eye-contact with his camera fully whilst he speaks, \u201cVery comfy,\u201d</p>\n<p>He snuggles his face into the front of the hoodie to demonstrate, \u201cThank you, Dream.\u201d</p>\n<p>Said man laughs happily in reply before he still manages to point out that his jumper is big on George.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdmit it. I\u2019m taller than you by far.\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s face morphs into a pout because now with hard evidence produced, he can\u2019t really counter this fact.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d He reluctantly admits, shoving his hands into the pocket of Dream\u2019s hoodie, \u201cBut only by, like, a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream chuckles again lowly, \u201cWhatever you say, <i>baby</i>,\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s face begins to heat up at the fondness in the other\u2019s words, imagining Dream\u2019s smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been an admittedly strange couple of days for George since Dream had sent him his hoodie.</p>\n<p>Since the two had reluctantly ended their Discord call, stretching it well into the early hours of the night, nothing much more about what was said, or occurred, has cropped up.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like either of them were particularly avoiding the topic or anything, just that they, or George at least, rather wouldn\u2019t closely examine this unspoken component of their friendship. </p>\n<p>So for now, naturally, it slides by.</p>\n<p>George has found himself frustratingly tied up in real-life things for the past few days and so is incredibly excited to be going live on stream with Dream this evening. </p>\n<p>They\u2019d texted and called briefly the nights in-between, but when George was battling to stay awake, desperately trying to stifle his yawns down the phone to Dream, the other man had quietly told him just to go to sleep already and that he doesn\u2019t have to call him if he\u2019s tired. To which George usually replied with a defiant \u2018no\u2019, before promptly falling asleep on the call.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, he\u2019d slept quite well last night, so he thinks this counts as a win. George is just sitting down at his desk when his monitor notifies him of an incoming TeamSpeak call with Dream.</p>\n<p>His heart does a weird skippy thing, pounding against his chest in a way that makes him feel warm and unstoppable. Sliding on his headphones and pointedly clearing his throat, George connects the call.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d He says, but it comes out quieter than he\u2019d expected, \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHellooo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream answers, dragging out the syllables as he loads up the game on their screens. George giggles at his antics because honestly anything Dream does in his <i>Dream</i>-like way, he would probably find adorable... and sometimes, hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream asks, pulling George back from his racing thoughts. Hastily, he checks the setup of his desk and is about to give the all-clear when he realises his camera\u2019s still not propped up correctly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, no, sorry, wait a sec.\u201d</p>\n<p>He requests, soon apologising again when he feels like he\u2019s taking too long to clip his tripod together. Dream just chuckles and assures him that it\u2019s fine. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a few more seconds before Dream asks meekly, \u201cYou\u2019re doing facecam today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Already flustered as he is, rapidly attempting to settle his camera position, George somehow feels himself flush an impossibly darker red, and he doesn\u2019t even know why.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s questions flying around his busy mind. Why would Dream ask that? Does he <i>want</i> to see George\u2019s face?</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>His heart-rate increases momentarily before he rationalises his own thoughts. Dream is just asking because he\u2019s curious. Not because of <i>him</i> in particular.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He exclaims happily with an exhausted sigh as he flops back in his chair after successfully positioning the camera before him. </p>\n<p>Dream laughs as George starts connecting the feed of the camera to the stream, ready to go live.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounded like it took some effort.\u201d</p>\n<p>George rolls his eyes even though he knows Dream can\u2019t see his face yet. He also finds himself checking his appearance in the reflection of his computer screen, running a hand through his hair, trying to tame the fluffiness, before he suddenly stops himself, questioning why he cares so much. </p>\n<p>Maybe because it\u2019s <i>different</i> this time, he thinks before quickly shaking the thought off and finally responding to Dream\u2019s dumb comment with a short whine.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fact that George wants to hear Dream say <i>certain</i> words to him again tickles like a feather in the back of his mind, but he pushes it away by focusing on the task at hand. </p>\n<p>A few more quick clicks and George finds himself fully set up and ready to go. He tells Dream this, who helpfully belatedly informs him that he\u2019d already started his own stream about a minute ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d George says light-heartedly, because he\u2019s physically incapable of saying it in any other way.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream chimes back, and George can just imagine the large grin pulling across his face. <i>Of course he doesn\u2019t.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, anyway,\u201d He says decisively, turning around the current topic of conversation, \u201cFirstly, hi to Dream\u2019s stream,\u201d</p>\n<p>George hears a light chuckle from Dream in his ears as he watches him open their latest shared survival.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecondly, I\u2019m starting my stream now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkayyy.\u201d Dream drawls out, playfully running in circles around George in game.</p>\n<p>He clicks a few more buttons before it all works.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d He greets cheerfully, shouting out some people in chat in the process, \u201cI could\u2019ve been here a lot earlier if a <i>certain</i> someone hadn\u2019t called me so late.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream stops what he\u2019s doing and runs over to Geroge before he responds, beginning with a pointed and unimpressed, yet playful silence.</p>\n<p>George turns to stare him dead in the eyes down the camera lens to hold his ground, but he soon realises that the little red light isn\u2019t flashing, even after all that palaver. </p>\n<p>With another small sigh he stretches his arm to click it on, it makes a satisfying \u2018Beep!\u2019 and George can finally sit back and relax as he watches it load up on his screen, connecting to the stream. </p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ll have you all know that <i>I</i> was the one who called George, so if anyone wasn\u2019t on time it was <i>him</i>,\u201d</p>\n<p>George allows himself to laugh at Dream\u2019s claim, still eagerly watching the video feed of his face load into the left corner. <i>Damn, this camera\u2019s on its last legs</i>, he thinks as he waits, listening to Dream still continuing to ramble on with a list of reasons why he was not late and making a mental note to start putting money aside to be able to buy a new one.</p>\n<p>\u201c-anyway, I\u2019m literally never late to anything. In fact, I prefer to be-...\u201d</p>\n<p>George only fully tunes back in to Dream\u2019s small rant at this point, but he quirks an eyebrow up in question to his TeamSpeak chat displayed beside him when his usually loud and out-spoken friend trails off in the middle of his sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>George asks with a slight chuckle as he finally starts moving in game. Now, however, Dream is perfectly still.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked if you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh... uh, yeah,\u201d If George didn\u2019t know any better, he might even say that Dream currently sounds <i>flustered</i>. But that\u2019s literally impossible, because Dream is the most cool and collected person he\u2019s ever met. He doesn\u2019t get <i>flustered</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream clears his throat rather loudly after this, arousing George\u2019s suspicions that the very opposite was in fact true. But he leaves it for now, because he knows Dream; he only says what he wants, when he wants. It\u2019s practically impossible to squeeze a forced word out of him, and believe him, he\u2019s tried.</p>\n<p>George is about to resume like nothing had happened, when the screen mirroring his stream catches his eye and he suddenly realises. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s currently wearing <i>it</i>... Dream\u2019s hoodie, live on stream. </p>\n<p>And now he\u2019s completely sure Dream will think he\u2019s absolutely shameless.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, George honestly hadn\u2019t realised he was still wearing the pale-blue jumper when he\u2019d initially sat down to stream. This was probably due to the fact that George has practically <i>lived</i> in Dream\u2019s hoodie at home ever since it arrived the other day.</p>\n<p>The temperature in England at the moment was dipping well beyond freezing daily, and with his apartment\u2019s crappy heating, it was a basic necessity to wear more than one layer of clothing when he is home.</p>\n<p>This is not the point, however. The point is that George actually has a large and impressive collection of hoodies at his disposal, as one tends to accumulate when living in a primarily cold region, and Dream is fully aware of this. Yet, despite his abnormally vast range of hoodies, George has still chosen to wear <i>Dream\u2019s</i>.</p>\n<p>George can\u2019t help but clear his throat a little too loudly before he just decides to try and gloss over it, like he never noticed why Dream got so choked up.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He announces, which also thankfully seems to pull Dream\u2019s attention back to their virtual world in some capacity at least.</p>\n<p>Spending a majority of the stream now hyper-aware of his outfit, George shifts in his seat and pulls the collar of the jumper upwards to try and quell the cold bite of air that still berates his skin after a couple hours of sitting still.</p>\n<p>His body must also let out an involuntary shiver because Dream asks, \u201cYou cold?\u201d</p>\n<p>George looks over at his TeamSpeak chat before remembering Dream can\u2019t actually see the questioning look on his face if he does so.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d </p>\n<p>He admits half-heartedly, worried about what would fly out of his mouth if he actually opened it because Dream had sounded so <i>concerned</i> when he\u2019d spoken.</p>\n<p>Then Dream comments, in an oh-so-casual tone, \u201cAt least you\u2019ve got a hoodie on.\u201d</p>\n<p>George really doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s heard that right.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ve got a hoodie,\u201d Nope, he was right, unfortunately, \u201cIt looks quite warm and soft too.\u201d</p>\n<p>George thinks his heart might just beat its way out of his chest like a butterfly beats its wings. He takes a deep breath before he even attempts to answer; flashbacks of a couple of nights ago and what Dream had said coming rushing back to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p>\n<p>George is pretty sure his cheeks are blushing bright red. To make it worse, judging by Dream\u2019s tone, he\u2019s pretty confident that the other man can tell.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not lying though. Dream\u2019s hoodie had an inviting and fluffy interior that greatly helps to regulate his own body temperature in this winter chill. It makes him feel warm as soon as he pulls it on, and George tries to tell himself that that <i>definitely</i> does not have anything to do with who\u2019s it is.</p>\n<p>But that never works, because when George is huddled up in the soft, baby-blue fabric, working on some project for either his channel or everyday life, he can\u2019t help but feel as if Dream is there with him. </p>\n<p>Even though, logically, he knows the other man is thousands of miles away across the Atlantic, George can <i>feel</i> his comforting warmth beside him.</p>\n<p>And if they do actually ever get to meet in real life at some point, George only hopes he can receive some of that warmth in the form of a hug too (or, if he dares to dream, more.)</p>\n<p>Dream speaks again; this time, lowly, sending pleasant shivers up George\u2019s spine that beat the cold by a mile.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get it?\u201d</p>\n<p>George is going to kill him.</p>\n<p>Just when he thought his face was returning to a more natural shade as well. He doesn\u2019t give the camera a death stare, as they\u2019re still streaming (for thousands to see, oh god), but he\u2019d VERY much like to. </p>\n<p>His hands don\u2019t seem to be working, so that\u2019s great; his brain feels like it\u2019s short-circuiting too. </p>\n<p>Dream is teasing him. Dream\u2019s teasing him because he <i>knows</i> George will flush alarmingly red like he always does when he messes with him (and he\u2019s starting to think Dream likes doing that <i>a lot</i>).</p>\n<p>Right now somehow it\u2019s even worse because they\u2019re both sitting right in front of a few thousand people, some of whom are their friends, and if George were to try and play the power move and reply with a short and assertive, \u2018From you.\u2019 He\u2019d never hear the end of it. From both the fandom and <i>especially</i> his friends.</p>\n<p>He quite likes to imagine, however, that such an answer would catch Dream off-guard. The other is so level-headed all the time that it\u2019s rare to fluster him; George only wishes he held such power.</p>\n<p>George lets out a small sigh before he gives the only answer he thinks he\u2019s capable of giving. His light tone is tinged with nervous laughter, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Comes Dream\u2019s near-perfectly faked and nonchalant voice. However, he can practically hear the large grin displayed on his face at his flustered state. </p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone else,\u201d He finally manages to begin with a curt clearing of his throat, eyes subconsciously flicking over to his TeamSpeak again, \u201cGave it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s perfectly aware he\u2019s being ambiguous and perhaps dancing on the edge of revealing the truth, but somehow it feels wrong to lie about the true owner of the pale-blue hoodie. Just like how it feels wrong to share it\u2019s true origins too; this hoodie is no longer Dream\u2019s to George, it\u2019s <i>theirs</i>. </p>\n<p>Dream makes an interested humming sound, that in a very different context would have perhaps invoked a very different reaction in George.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s brain and limbs finally seem to start working again so he resumes his game before he responds to Dream with a a short, yet soft, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pleasantly warm feeling bubbling up through his bones, filling each and every inch of his body with content at Dream\u2019s familiar antics. This only increases tenfold at the charming timbre of Dream\u2019s wheezy and mischievous laugh.</p>\n<p>Once again, George does his best not to peruse the origins of his emotions too curiously, afraid he\u2019ll find something he could never have.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the stream continues rather successfully and without any further hitch. That is until it\u2019s about four in the morning in London and George can literally <i>feel</i> his body calling out for sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cBye guys!\u201d</p>\n<p>He chirps as happily as he can in his fatigued state. As soon as the stream\u2019s off, however, he realises that he may be able to convince his viewers, but he\u2019d never be able to kid Dream.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should go to bed.\u201d The other man tells him, voice so soft and pillowy that George feels like he could just fall right into it (or, preferably, <i>him</i>).</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d He half-heartedly admits with the little energy he still has, \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfft, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s voice is still lulling him to sleep, perhaps that\u2019s why he nearly physically jumps when he hears him finish speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby, you\u2019ll be tired tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Oh, God</i>. Thank the lord his face cam is no longer on.</p>\n<p>He pauses in middle of tidying his desk, as he usually tries to do before going to bed, but now his hands are stuck in mid-air. His fingers find the hem of his sleeves, gripping and fiddling with them as he remains perfectly breathless.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d</p>\n<p><i>God</i>. He\u2019s forgotten how to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s so quiet and light that George doesn\u2019t even think Dream will be able to hear him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out tomorrow, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream continues speaking as he\u2019s in the process of reuniting his body and soul. He makes a small hum of the affirmative, hoping the other will just put it down to his tiredness.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you should go to bed,\u201d Dream finishes finally, \u201cYou\u2019ll be exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every word Dream says to him is correct. But George doesn\u2019t want to go to bed, because bed means no <i>Dream</i>. </p>\n<p>At least, not until the morning.</p>\n<p>However, in his lucid state he must let this slip in some form because, before he knows it, Dream is asking in his warm and comforting voice, \u201cWe could stay on the call if you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time George gives him a short silence before answering, biting his lip, \u201cI-... okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to trouble Dream; he knows he has things to do, plans he\u2019s made for later today, people to see.</p>\n<p>But Dream must foresee his protests because he tells him quietly and calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>George nods, forgetting momentarily that Dream can\u2019t actually see him for a few seconds as he climbs into his bed with its inviting and warmth quilted sheets, hoodie still on and pulled close to him.</p>\n<p>He feels himself drifting off into the unconscious lands when he manages to catch Dream\u2019s last few words to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust go to sleep, baby.\u201d </p>\n<p>Making an unintelligible noise of acknowledgment, George nuzzles his face further into his pillow and drifts off with warm thoughts and a blissful smile.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re practicing their parkour for the next MC championships the next weekend and, safe to say, it\u2019s not going too well for George.</p>\n<p>He does his best to withhold his screech as he falls off the same obstacle for the seventeenth time. Briefly, George had considered streaming their practice again, but now that he\u2019s frustrated out of his mind at this <i>stupid</i> jump, he\u2019s very glad he decided against it at the last minute.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been at it for about an hour. Sapnap was here previously for a little while but soon became so frustrated he had to quit. Bad followed him soon after, explaining that Sapnap had insisted on dragging him away to play something else.</p>\n<p>The creators keep making everything harder and George, much like many of the other attendees, can never keep up. But George knows of one man who surely can; Dream\u2019s the reason they have to keep changing the levels, for Pete\u2019s sake. </p>\n<p>\u201cUGH.\u201d </p>\n<p>George can\u2019t contain his anger as he fails the same jump <i>again</i>. He\u2019s beginning to worry that he might just send his hand through the wood of his desk at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d He whines, stopping attempting the jump altogether for a moment to catch his breath and rejuvenate his focus.</p>\n<p>Dream lets out a chuckle as George lets out another shout as he falls <i>again</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Stop it</i>.\u201d George complains, dragging out the last word.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop laughing at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Dream sings cheerfully, and can\u2019t help but laugh again at George\u2019s whine, which has him joining in too after a while. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s about a minute that follows before Dream speaks again, this time his voice is softer and quieter; smooth silk to George\u2019s ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re angry.\u201d </p>\n<p>As expected, George is blushing uncontrollable shades of ruby and scarlet, face scrunching up as he feels a warm wave of emotion hitting his chest and travelling sensationally up his spine to his brain. </p>\n<p>He is <i>so</i> glad Dream\u2019s comment requires no answer, as the other seems to have already moved past the moment, complaining about his next jump. George is positive he would\u2019ve blurted out something completely stupid.</p>\n<p>Blatantly changing the subject, begging for an opportunity to let his pounding heart quell, he groans loudly, \u201cDream, I give up.\u201d</p>\n<p>His words have the other man teleporting right back next to him, even though he was nearing the end of a perfect run.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I am <i>this</i> far from completely loosing my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>George holds his fingers up to the camera, a millimetre apart, for Dream to see.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Dream says in his ever-soothing tone, \u201cJust calm down and tell me what you\u2019re doing wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Holding his silence for a second, George soon motions to the end of the stage.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat last stupid trapdoor,\u201d He admits quietly, knowing Dream always breezes past this section in one quick run and feeling a strange sense of inadequacy, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dream starts the stage and reaches the jump, \u201cCome here and I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p>\n<p>George can\u2019t help his little smile. They\u2019re not even on the same team this time and Dream is helping him at the expense of his own practice time. It makes his chest feel warm.</p>\n<p>It takes him a good ten minutes, watching and listening to Dream talk him through the same jump about twenty times, but George eventually starts to be able to make it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go!\u201d Dream exclaims, as he makes the jump for the third time in a row, \u201cSee, I told you you\u2019d get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other man sounds just as excited as George feels at finally being able to get over the largest obstacle stuck in his way. He\u2019s also very glad he didn\u2019t just waste Dream\u2019s precious practice time for nothing.</p>\n<p>Laughing happily, George thanks him and completes the jump yet again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa,\u201d Dream interjects, \u201cYou\u2019ll be giving me a run for my money soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfft, I highly doubt that.\u201d</p>\n<p>George shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Dream sounds genuinely curious, and George can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s just fishing for compliments or playing dumb, but he gives in either way. Not before tutting at him disapprovingly, of course.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d George starts shakily, vaguely gesturing with his hands in real life for some reason too before he puts them back on the desk, \u201cYou\u2019re... you. You know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream leaves a silence like he\u2019s waiting for George to elaborate more.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it.\u201d George says between nervous laughs, whining slightly.</p>\n<p>Then it\u2019s Dream\u2019s turn to laugh questioningly, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d He reluctantly resumes after a short pause, cheeks flushing slightly pink for some unknown reason at dishing out praise for Dream, \u201cYou\u2019re like... good at <i>EVERYTHING</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream seems to process his comment for moment, judging by the emptiness that follows. George is just about to give in to his anxiety and backtrack himself massively when Dream\u2019s cheerful laughter chimes in his ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwww, George,\u201d Dream\u2019s tone is sweet and flattered, but overly-so, <i>teasing</i>, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you looked up to me so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>George lets himself chuckle, \u201c<i>Shut up</i>, you idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>But can\u2019t help but think, of course he does. Almost everyone does. </p>\n<p>Suddenly he wonders if Dream even realises this sometimes or if he\u2019s just too busy being immersed in his competitive nature to notice.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Dream chirps, jumping around him excitedly, \u201cLet\u2019s race each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lets out a short laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that? You\u2019ll just win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream whines in protest and George finds himself surprised, not expecting it to mean so much to the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d George snorts when he doesn\u2019t even try to dent the fact that he\u2019ll probably win, \u201cJust the first three stages then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Upon considering this, George finds this proposal to certainly be slightly more fair; he\u2019s pretty good at the first three now having gotten past the stupid trapdoor jump.</p>\n<p>But then he remembers he\u2019s up against Dream, parkour extraordinaire, and rethinks his entire answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t-\u201c</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t finish his sentence because Dream cuts him off, probably very much aware of what he\u2019s about to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon. <i>Please</i>?\u201d The other urges, and George can start to feel his weak heart crumbling at his pleads (<i>God</i>, he\u2019s in way too deep), \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Making a face that suggests the entire opposite, George gives a death stare at his TeamSpeak chat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d He provides, trailing off. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter because Dream soon fills the silence, apparently VERY excited by his idea judging by his loud and bouncy tone of voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, wait, wait, wait,\u201d Dream tells him, jumping up and down next to him as George stands still to listen, \u201cHow about an incentive?\u201d</p>\n<p>Admittedly, George is now very intrigued.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears Dream chuckle, pleased at having tempted him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike,\u201d Dream begins, speaking quickly, almost as if he had planned this from the very beginning, \u201cIf the other wins, we have to do something they ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s mind is <i>racing, racing, racing</i>. This can\u2019t be good.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence before George realises Dream is waiting for him to speak first.</p>\n<p>\u201cI- um. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He stutters, still not acclimatised to his body\u2019s heightened state that appears whenever Dream opens his stupid mouth, adrenaline pumps through his pulsing veins.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon,\u201d Dream drawls, quietening his tone slightly in the process, \u201cJust think. What\u2019s one thing you want from me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>God forbid, if he actually answered that question truthfully.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Upon much more careful and constrained consideration and even more \u2018um\u2019s and \u2018ah\u2019s, he finally comes up with something.</p>\n<p>George speaks in a contained voice and puts forth his suggestion to Dream.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well,\u201d He begins, Dream just waits expectantly. George clears his throat quietly again, \u201cMaybe we could FaceTime?\u201d</p>\n<p>He plays with his fingers and picks at his nails as he waits for Dream\u2019s response.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike properly, this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t add the part that contains the fact that this is because George really, <i>really,</i> wants to see Dream\u2019s face again. It feels so long since the last time that in his imagination it comes together as a slight blur; George feels himself strangely angry at himself for forgetting the face of someone who means so much to him, even if it is in the slightest way.</p>\n<p>So, yeah. George definitely wants to FaceTime Dream and take in his handsome features once again. That\u2019s another thing, his best friend is annoyingly and undeniably <i>hot</i>. Ugh. </p>\n<p>Eventually, the silence stretches on for so long that George starts shuffling in his seat and eventually speaks up, voice tinged with defensiveness.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream just hums in reply, like he\u2019s mulling George\u2019s request over in his magnificent brain. George\u2019s anxiety hits peak levels, so he asks again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to dream bigger?\u201d The other asks eventually.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a bad pun.\u201d George tells him, giggling anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Oh, I didn\u2019t even mean to- never mind.\u201d Dream laughs his way through his words cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just meant,\u201d Dream starts again, this time, carefully, \u201cYou can ask for <i>anything</i>, literally anything from me, George, and it\u2019s yours... don\u2019t you want more?\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Of course</i> George wants more. Of course he does. But he can\u2019t bring himself to ask, even when Dream seems to be offering it out to him so freely.</p>\n<p>Instead, \u201cWell, what do you want if <i>you</i> win then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream dramatically pauses like he\u2019s thinking, but the clarity and assuredness of his answer makes George question if it\u2019s even very impromptu at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I win,\u201d The other starts, giving himself his own dramatic pause. George shakes his head at his antics as he waits, \u201cYou have to wear my hoodie on stream for the MCC.\u201d</p>\n<p>George pauses. They hadn\u2019t mentioned it since the incident, and he hadn\u2019t tried to even bring it up thinking they had reached some sort of unspoken agreement not to speak of such things. </p>\n<p>Apparently not.</p>\n<p>Not even having to check his face in the reflection of his mirror, George can tell he\u2019s currently a lately too-familiar bright red.</p>\n<p>George can hear Dream\u2019s small mischievous laughs down the call, the butterflies in George\u2019s stomach that have been there for <i>weeks</i> have started fluttering delicately again. Their wings taking them high into the sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf-,\u201d He tries his best to reply without tripping up on his words, but he doesn\u2019t even make it through one. He clears his throat again, \u201cSure, if... that\u2019s what you want...\u201d</p>\n<p>George can\u2019t stop his words from sounding unsure. He smiles when Dream softly replies with a reassuring affirmative, feeling almost as if his blush has creeped across his heart too. </p>\n<p>He also doesn\u2019t mention the fact that he\u2019s still wearing Dream\u2019s hoodie right now, probably because he knows the other man will say something that gets his poor face lighting up flushed scarlet again and he doesn\u2019t think he can take much more.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s this that supplies him with sudden confidence, or maybe it\u2019s his frustration at Dream\u2019s uncanny ability to make him blush deep, dark shades of red, but George has a sudden urge to do something, or say something to catch his ridiculously laid-back friend off-guard for once in his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided what I want if I win.\u201d He tells Dream, surprising himself with the ease and lack of wavering in his voice. Not that it particularly helps, but he finds himself sitting up straighter in his chair, determined, \u201cAnything, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, yes,\u201d Dream says, and George loves that he has no idea what\u2019s coming, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes a breath before he dives in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to come and visit me.\u201d</p>\n<p>George waits a moment, and then another, and then there it is: unflappable Dream struck speechless for once. </p>\n<p>He can\u2019t help but feel quite proud, but on the other hand, his anxiety has kicked right back in where his levels of adrenaline have ran out. His heart\u2019s now thumping loudly in his chest, banging against his rib cage and oh, god, why did he do this to himself?</p>\n<p>Dream probably thinks he\u2019s too eager, that he\u2019s <i>weird</i> or something. All these stupid thoughts that he\u2019d never have believed to be true fly through his mind at this one moment. </p>\n<p>Then Dream takes a shaky breath before he answers after a long pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>George has to hold back a gasp of his own because his voice is so tender and soft, like cotton-warmed linen on a summer\u2019s day.</p>\n<p>\u201cW-what?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s an idiot for thinking he could play this off nonchalantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you win,\u201d Dream\u2019s speaking slowly, like he\u2019s trying to confirm that this is actually what George said and wants, \u201cI\u2019ll come and see you next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a resurgence of adrenaline and endorphins in George\u2019s veins shortly, before he remembers he\u2019s got to win this stupid bet before that even happens. But the prospect of it is closer than they\u2019ve ever got to meeting up before, and it\u2019s making George\u2019s heart ache.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d George only finds himself able to say, worried that if he lets his mouth run he\u2019d say those words he\u2019d never be able to take back.</p>\n<p>They finally line up at the start of the parkour trail and George is currently questioning his current life choices all over again. He\u2019s attempting to concentrate when Dream interjects (which really should be considered as cheating, he thinks).</p>\n<p>\u201cI would\u2019ve come anyway,\u201d Dream tells him quietly, apparently still surprisingly tongue-tied, \u201cIf you\u2019d asked, I mean. You didn\u2019t have to bet it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of reading too much into the other\u2019s words, Geroge simply says, \u201cIt\u2019s what I want.\u201d and hopes that his point gets across.</p>\n<p>Dream tuts as he sets their countdown for the race, \u201cYour\u2019s is so good though,\u201d He seems to say almost absentmindedly.</p>\n<p>Then more eagerly and loudly, \u201cCan I change mine? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>George feels an involuntary smile pull up at his dusted cheeks. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins further at Dream\u2019s spluttering protests, claiming they never even set the rules in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change!\u201d George insists, holding true to his argument despite imagining Dream\u2019s incredibly cute and handsome pout that would be on display about now, \u201cThat defeats the point of the bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream huffs loudly, George is half glad and half sad he\u2019s so quick to return to his loudly-spoken usual self. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Nooo</i>. No,\u201d George vaguely thinks that he sounds like a whiny child unable to get his way, \u201cLet me, please? I want you to come to the US, I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s heart must shoot absolute fireworks as he feels his entire body electrify at Dream\u2019s off-handed yet so sincere comment.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t help breathing out, \u201cYou want... to see me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Of course</i> I want to see you,\u201d Dream says expressly, stressing each word like it\u2019s an undisputed fact. His tone turns softer at then end, \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once again, Dream\u2019s managed to turn his own teasing back onto himself, a never-ending, yet endearing side effect of being friends with the eccentric twenty-one-year-old.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream asks again in a small voice. George can feel his stubborn walls breaking, but before the large cracks can give way entirely, George forces himself to stay true to his word.</p>\n<p>\u201cRules are rules.\u201d He enjoys sing-songing at Dream, happy grin on his face at having the upper hand in their situation, which doesn\u2019t happen very often at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, <i>fineee</i>.\u201d He hears Dream sigh out before he announces the countdown\u2019s ready.</p>\n<p>George had almost forgot about the stupid bet altogether. His heart starts fluttering again.</p>\n<p>Dream counts them down abruptly, and they\u2019re neck and neck on the first two stages, mere milliseconds apart, if anything. </p>\n<p>Then they reach George\u2019s arch-nemesis, the dreaded trapdoors. George is holding his breath as he focuses with a hundred and ten percent of his brain, fingers dancing quickly and precisely over his mouse and keyboard.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both at the last jump and George makes a small grunting noise of effort as he prays to god that he\u2019ll make it and he DOES.</p>\n<p>He daren\u2019t even check or think about where Dream is until he leaps onto the island at the end and gets the achievement announcing he\u2019s completed the third stage. </p>\n<p>He flicks his mouse around to check quickly, \u201cWait, did I win?\u201d</p>\n<p>Just then he sees Dream respawn on the island opposite him, backwards in progress, on level <i>two</i>.</p>\n<p>George is pretty sure he makes some strange strangulated noise, a mix, perhaps, of a shriek of glee and a gasp. He can just about hear Dream\u2019s light chuckling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won right?\u201d He checks again, voice high in pitch and tone with his excitement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed the last jump,\u201d Dream explains, finally leaping onto the same island as George beside him, \u201cSo yeah, you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>A large and insatiable grin flies across George\u2019s face, toothy and ridiculously happy. The butterflies that were relentlessly glittering and twisting inside his stomach disappear as if being set free; he did it.</p>\n<p>He makes a loud and unintelligible noise of surprise and cheer, which only causes Dream to emit his loud and wheezy laugh even harder. The sound only increases George\u2019s excitement, amping him up. </p>\n<p>Although, George is briefly suspicious, having seen the other man make that jump in his sleep many a time before, and considers that Dream sounds amazingly happy for someone who\u2019d just lost a bet to him, but he really doesn\u2019t care right now.</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s coming to visit him next week. <i>Finally</i>, after years of knowing each other and only brief and obscure glances at the other\u2019s face, George is finally going to match the melodic voice behind a screen to a face he could analyse from every angle, etch into his memory and never let himself forget.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to meet Dream, his imagination runs away with him, imagining endless scenarios and interactions between them both. </p>\n<p>Then suddenly, the reality of the situation hits him a little harder and his anxiety spikes his heart rate again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i>Dream</i>.</p>\n<p>Visiting him.</p>\n<p><i>Next week</i>.</p>\n<p>Oh, God.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the hell is Dream?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sapnap asks him down their Discord call. True, Dream would normally be online with them right about now, and far into the early morning and beyond. But the man hasn\u2019t touched his Discord all day and Sapnap seems very pressed in finding out why.</p>\n<p>George knows exactly why.</p>\n<p>Dream is currently on a trans-Atlantic flight to London. To see <i>him</i>.</p>\n<p>The thought still gives him tingling butterflies and shivers up his spine even though he\u2019s had almost a full week to process the whole situation now. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter though, because George is well aware of the fact that his nervousness probably won\u2019t even die down until he clamps his eyes on the other, and most likely not even then. George is learning to live with the constant buzzing excitement building in his body, mind forever preoccupied with thoughts about what Dream\u2019s face, eyes, hair, height, <i>everything</i> will look like.</p>\n<p>George has no idea about exactly how clued up on the whole situation Sapnap currently is, but from the sound of it, not very much at all. </p>\n<p><i>Perhaps Dream wants to tell him when he\u2019s already here.</i> He considers, shutting out all the stupid thoughts like Dream doesn\u2019t want anyone to know they\u2019re meeting, or is ashamed of him.</p>\n<p>He has to shake his head in real life to retract that awful train of thought that is entirely and most definitely NOT true. George\u2019s very thoughts are reinforced by what Dream had sent him just before he got on his flight; it was early morning for George, so he was fast asleep, meaning he couldn\u2019t really talk to him beforehand.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4:49am <i>dream:</i></b>\n<i> about 10 mins until my flight! i can\u2019t wait to see you</i>\n</p>\n<p>George\u2019s face had undeniably gleamed when he woke up to his message this morning. </p>\n<p>\n<b>4:51am <i>dream:</i></b>\n<i> this is what i\u2019m wearing, btw. so you know it\u2019s me &lt;3 </i>\n</p>\n<p>Attached is a photo of Dream\u2019s outfit, as stated previously; no face yet though, taken from just above the neck and down. George desperately attempts to tell himself that Dream\u2019s grey joggers and not-so-loose white t-shirt have absolutely no effect on him at all.</p>\n<p>The little heart emoticon tagged onto the end of his message definitely doesn\u2019t help his case either; he\u2019d rolled back over in his bed and smiled a stupid grin into his pillow.</p>\n<p>George is pretty sure he could have picked Dream out from the crowd at the airport anyway, without an outfit to match it to. Number one, because he\u2019s <i>ridiculously</i> and incredibly tall (at least compared to him), but two, because George has a feeling he will just <i>know</i>. Their eyes would meet and he\u2019d know.</p>\n<p>However, George is now massively regretting not just pushing through his fatigue and talking with the other non-stop before he got on his flight. A flight that means a Dream-less eight hours that George is currently biblically cursing.</p>\n<p><i>Can you even miss someone for just eight hours?</i> Well, George certainly can, he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s stared at the photo Dream had sent him about four times in the past hour alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d George supplies Sapnap, after realising he never replied, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Elusive bastard</i>.\u201d The other only says, fondly.</p>\n<p>George is trying his best not to nervously chuckle but this is honestly a prime time. He distracts himself with the game, at least they weren\u2019t currently streaming.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s about another hour of them idly chatting about random things until Sapnap brings it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dude,\u201d He starts, punching George in game, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with your hoodie? It was literally <i>all</i> over my Twitter feed the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p>This stops George suddenly in his tracks, heart rate skyrocketing and making him feel a little dizzy. To be honest, he\u2019d kind of figured that Dream would\u2019ve shared such information with his one of his best friends, but it makes George feel so much warmer for some reason to find out that he hasn\u2019t. This thing is <i>theirs</i>.</p>\n<p>(And, well, a small proportion of fans on Twitter who are throwing theories out left right and centre about who\u2019s hoodie George was wearing. Most of them have got it right.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t really see.\u201d He tells his friend, voice suddenly flat and monotone as it tends to go when he\u2019s lying horribly out of his teeth.</p>\n<p>He refuses to let his eyes trace over to Sapnap\u2019s video call because he\u2019d probably give way to the truth immediately.</p>\n<p>Apparently, however, his friend knows him all too well.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d He asks, tone already becoming more playful and teasing, \u201c<i>Georgeeee?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>George takes a large gulp of air before he responds, \u201cHmm?\u201d without looking away from his screen, attempting to focus and blinker his attention with his heart\u2019s content.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething\u2019s up,\u201d Sapnap starts curiously, yet declaratively, as if he\u2019s sure of it, \u201cC\u2019mon, what is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing through his teeth, with the knowledge that his face is tinkering on the edge of flushing bright red, George decides he can\u2019t maintain his silence much longer. Besides, he hates keeping too much from his close friends too. </p>\n<p>However, when he tries to start talking, George finds it harder than he thought he would. It\u2019s like there\u2019s sweet honey stuck in his mouth, clamping it shut and he has to take another huge breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, uh, you see this hoodie,\u201d George motions to his body where he\u2019s currently donning the soft, pale-blue garment, simultaneously thinking about how the fact that he\u2019s currently wearing it right now is not going to help his case at all, \u201cI, um...\u201d</p>\n<p>He trails off but Sapnap waits patiently; looking over to his video call once again, George can see he\u2019s got one eyebrow raised. He has to look away though, too shy to admit it directly face-to-face. George clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cDream... gave it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>George dares to flick his gaze over to his friend\u2019s face once again, but soon twists right back to his game when Sapnap starts speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike as a present?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, uh, it\u2019s-,\u201d <i>God</i>, George is going to disintegrate on the spot, \u201cit\u2019s his...\u201d</p>\n<p>Sapnap is quiet for an abnormally long time; George is still staring at the pause screen on his game, watching for movement out of the corner of his eye. There\u2019s none and his heart skips a beat, pounding against his chest.</p>\n<p>Starting to get worried, George begins to consider backtracking on himself, or even turning to the other to see his reaction face-to-face. These thoughts spiral around in his mind, casting him down, down, down until a heaven-splitting voice is cast out of his poor speakers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWHAT.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sapnap yells at the top of his voice, literally causing George to jump in his seat a little, setting his heart to race even faster that it already is. </p>\n<p>He can\u2019t help but turn back to face his friend\u2019s face now, and isn\u2019t it an amusing sight to see; George has never seen Sapnap display such an expression of surprise, shock and underlying glee before. It\u2019s so funny to him that he almost forgets about his current situation when he can\u2019t help but laugh a little at Sapnap\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Then comes the unintelligible, but just as loud, spluttering, \u201cYou- Dream gave you- Oh my God.\u201d</p>\n<p>George lets himself laugh harder now, if he\u2019s going to be interrogated, he may as well have some fun beforehand.</p>\n<p>Once the initial surprise wears off, Sapnap\u2019s facial expression slowly morphs back to some sort of normal. His eyes are still wide and highly interested, apparently, drinking in each word of the story entirely as Geroge finds it best just to recount what had happened to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, he literally just mailed it to you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Sapnap\u2019s question is asked through incredulous chuckles at his best friend\u2019s antics, although, somehow George gets the impression that he\u2019s not actually that surprised Dream would do such a thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup.\u201d He confirms, now feeling slightly less on edge than he did before; his hands have stopped shaking enough for him to resume his game.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you wore it for him?\u201d Sapnap asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d George can feel his face blushing ruby red and his palms begin to slide off the mouse slightly due to his increase in sweat. His words are a mismatch of stutters, \u201cNot- not exactly <i>for</i> him. I, uh, put it on, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears a light tut from Sapnap and glances a brief rolling of eyes before he continues, though the other man quickly resumes talking before he can question it at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you wore it again on stream,\u201d Sapnap clarifies in a questioning tone, George closes his eyes but nods slowly, \u201cAnd you keep wearing it whenever I see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s watching Sapnap\u2019s face again out of one eye. His friend is currently close to the camera, eyes wide and both eyebrows raised this time, as he repeats George\u2019s story he\u2019d just told him extremely briefly, as if he\u2019s expecting George to continue.</p>\n<p><i>Well</i>, George thinks, thoughts bouncing around his brain, <i>When you put it like that, it sounds...</i></p>\n<p>Suddenly, he decides he\u2019s in dire need of a topic change. He\u2019s raking his rushing mind for ideas when Sapnap suddenly stops moving on the screen in front of George, hand paused mid-air as George watches his features open up into an expression of shock and realisation.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d </p>\n<p>Is all Sapnap says, voice astounded. George is hooked on every word, gaze drawn directly back to their video call from sheer curiosity. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that means Sapnap gets to look him directly in the eyes as he finishes, asking.</p>\n<p>\u201cDream\u2019s flying to England, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s jaw drops wide open before he can even <i>try</i> to protest in the slightest way. He can only watch, defeatedly, as Sapnap\u2019s whole face lights up with a toothy and mischievous grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI KNEW IT.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sapnap\u2019s shout is happy and triumphant, to what exactly his is currently referring in particular, George doesn\u2019t know. He listens to Sapnap muttering under his breath to himself, probably something about Dream not telling him about this in the first place.</p>\n<p>Still watching with wide eyes and frozen in place in his chair at this unexpected revelation of the younger man\u2019s, George does his best to let his beating heart recover to its fullest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p>\n<p>George can\u2019t stop himself from guffawing and adding, \u201cNeither can I.\u201d</p>\n<p>He immediately regrets it though, because he seems to draw all of his friend\u2019s attention from Dream\u2019s omission of his travels back onto himself. </p>\n<p><i>Oh no. Good job, George</i>. </p>\n<p>Sapnap\u2019s smile glints at him down the call and George can practically see the millions of questions he\u2019s about to launch on him in the cheeky glimmer in his eyes. </p>\n<p>Wanting to leave with some kind of victory after his continuous losses to Sapnap\u2019s apparent uncanny skills of deduction, George lets his inner mischief fuel him as he laughs loudly before saying, \u201cBye, Sapnap.\u201d </p>\n<p>He moves to disconnect the call and Sapnap even says a \u2018goodbye\u2019 back to him out of deep-ridden habit until he fully processes what\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, George!\u201d George does not, continuing to shut down his computer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sorry. I have to meet <i>Dream</i> at the airport soon.\u201d He enjoys playing with a teasing tone and watching Sapnap\u2019s mouth drop even more at his confirmative words.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no wait! C\u2019mon, at least tell me-\u201c</p>\n<p>Sapnap\u2019s protesting and whiny tone is cut out when George finally hits \u2018disconnect call\u2019, and he finds himself congratulating himself, even if this was only a slight, slight victory.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d very much rather explain everything later to Sapnap, when Dream has arrived and must feel his wrath too (luckily, probably more so than George). </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Airports are one of George\u2019s least favourite places. </p>\n<p>The clangorous hustle and bustle of holiday-goers mixed with the stress and frustration of businessmen and women alike is just absolutely enough to drive him barking mad.</p>\n<p>Right now though, there\u2019s no place he\u2019d rather be. Because Dream is going to be here, any minute, standing physically in front of him. No longer mere stolen glances of pixels, no longer a smooth and silky voice received through crackly headphones and speakers. Real.</p>\n<p> George bounces on the balls of his feet, half from his attempts to calm down and half from the bitter bite of cold that still manages to seep into the airport terminal. </p>\n<p>Winters in England are harsh and unforgiving and this year it\u2019s no different. This is the excuse George uses to justify him wearing <i>the</i> hoodie to meet up with Dream to himself.</p>\n<p>Pulling the baggy, pale-blue material closer around him and checking his phone again, George quickly mentally assesses his outfit once more. Like he hadn\u2019t spent roughly an hour deciding on what to wear before driving here.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d ended up in his favourite black jeans and a soft, yet plain, grey t-shirt. Yes, he knows his outfit doesn\u2019t <i>sound</i> like it should have taken as much contemplation as it did but, admittedly, a large proportion of that time was spent by him taking the hoodie on and off, wondering whether to bring it at all.</p>\n<p>George is very glad he did, though, because he\u2019s been standing around at the gate exit for about twenty minutes now. <i>Bloody airports are never on time.</i> He thinks, rubbing both his hands together in the jumper pocket.</p>\n<p>Dream had apparently touched down on the runway about ten minutes ago. George had presumed he\u2019d receive some form of communication to inform him that he\u2019d landed safely or something, but there\u2019s been nothing so far. It\u2019s not helping his state of anxious excitement.</p>\n<p>He finds he can no longer think about the situation too closely now that the time had actually arrived, or it begins to feel like his brain will actually explode. George dreads to think of what he\u2019ll do when the other man actually appears in front of him. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Something stupid probably.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Checking his phone for the time and any texts again, George almost drops it when he jumps at the sound of a familiar voice coming from behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d</p>\n<p>His feet twist his body around for him, drawn to the source of the melodic voice like a moth to a flame. Casting his eyes up from his phone, George finally unites the voice to a face.</p>\n<p>Golden hair and tanned cheeks dotted with a light dusting of pale freckles stand nearly a foot above him. The difference between their heights is noticeable, as George cranes his neck slightly further upwards to make sure he maps the entirety of his features.</p>\n<p>His eyes are <i>green</i> and even though George knows they must be even brighter in reality than they are to him, he still thinks they\u2019re beautiful, gleaming under the harsh lights of the terminal.</p>\n<p>A tentative and careful pearly white smile is currently stretching out across those tanned cheeks, accompanied by a breathtaking scrunching up of the man\u2019s glittering eyes. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Dream.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Longer rather than shorter blond hair is shaken out of his eyeline, mesmerising George until he dares to follow the other\u2019s gaze across his own body and suddenly he\u2019s heating up rapidly in his hoodie.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\n<i>The hoodie.</i>\n</p>\n<p>George finally takes a breath and lets the tsunami of red blush rush over his face, accepting his fate as inevitable anyway. He takes a few steps forward, surprisingly easily, he likes to think, but his brain almost short-circuits when Dream speaks again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Breathless in tone and dazzled by his perfect smile, the words do something funny to George\u2019s poor heart. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Is all he can get himself to say back, half frozen, half physically buzzing from excitement.</p>\n<p>He watches as Dream slowly places his bag on top of his suitcase, not breaking their eye contact as if they\u2019d lose each other forever if they looked away. </p>\n<p>\u201cI-... You-,\u201d Dream tries to start, visibly frustrated with himself when he stutters. George withholds his chuckles, heart palpitating rapidly, although he\u2019s pretty sure that Dream notices anyway. He quirks his mouth upwards in what he hopes is a reassuring smile. </p>\n<p>In the end, Dream takes a couple more seconds and few breaths before he gives in and asks, eyes searching his own, \u201c<i>Baby</i>, can I hug you?\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s heart is going to burst out of his chest in the middle of Heathrow airport. Despite this, he feels his own expression soften and watches Dream\u2019s brighten impossibly more as he nods and tells him breathlessly and barely audibly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes no longer than a few seconds for him to find himself engulfed in the taller\u2019s strong and grounding arms. Once his heart gets over the initial shock and starts beating again, George lets his hands grip tightly onto the soft cotton of Dream\u2019s shirt; arms naturally weaving over his shoulders as Dream had wrapped his arms tightly around George\u2019s middle.</p>\n<p>He thanks the heavens that it\u2019s winter and he\u2019s got at least two layers of clothes on, because George worries a misplaced touch of skin-on-skin would\u2019ve sent him fainting to the floor. </p>\n<p>Settling a little and moving his hands to press flat against Dream\u2019s back, George suddenly realises that Dream\u2018s form is slightly muscular.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s largely unidentifiable without the accompaniment of touch, him being a tall and rather slender individual, but it\u2019s definitely there. Because George can feel it under the thin material of his t-shirt and he can\u2019t help but think that with his height and strength Dream could probably easily <i>pick him up</i>.</p>\n<p>The angle has him slightly on tip-toes, leaning in towards Dream\u2019s body. Their heads are side by side, resting on the other\u2019s shoulder. George situates his cheek on the other man and inhales; he\u2019s immediately greeted by the warm sandalwood scent that had clung the baby-blue hoodie when he had first received it. </p>\n<p>It does something that calms the pace of his rapidly beating heart, like sinking into a warm but deep sea, and George is glad for it. Not to mention that he\u2019s even more glad now that he\u2019s in the presence of the very source.</p>\n<p>Starting to slip into a state of relaxation rather than anxiousness for the first time in about a week, George can\u2019t help himself from emitting a contented sigh. </p>\n<p>His body is electrified again, however, when against the flushed skin of his cheek, George swears he feels Dream\u2019s mouth pull upwards into a giddy smile. The strong arms around his waist tighten too, as if unwilling to let go, but eventually he does, because they have to. Because they\u2019re still in the middle of the airport.</p>\n<p>When they both retract from the embrace, Dream\u2019s hands linger at either side of his waist causing a severe flood of red to rush to the surface of George\u2019s skin. The taller man\u2019s emerald eyes still eagerly roam every square inch of his face, as if etching it into his mind. George has already done the same to Dream.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re looking at each other, still slightly dazed and in a state of disbelief that this was actually happening, like, right now. George forces himself to speak before his stupid mouth can supply something else.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have all your bags?\u201d</p>\n<p>George asks, proud when his question is spoken without heinous spluttering, as he had expected. Dream looks down, checking quickly, and gives him the affirmative with a (cute) little nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get in the car then.\u201d George had to actively stop himself from saying, <i>\u2019Let\u2019s go home then.\u2019</i> and exposing the fact that he associates Dream with being <i>home</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dream drawls out, tugging his suitcase in line behind him. The two of them fall into step easily, making it to the sliding doors just before the car park. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s already dark outside because of the early-setting sun in English winters, the harsh bite of cold has not relented either. George is snuggling Dream\u2019s hoodie closer to his body, thankful for its warmth, when he turns to look at the other.</p>\n<p><i>Oh, right.</i> </p>\n<p>George had forgot that Dream is a through and through Floridian, with not much experience of foreign countries at all, let alone cold ones. He\u2019s currently still only wearing his white t-shirt and grey joggers, meaning George is very easily able to see him shivering and shaking when the doors slide open and the merciless wind slaps cold air into their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold?\u201d He asks, even though it\u2019s obvious.</p>\n<p>His face breaks into a smile when Dream gives him a scrunched-up face that screams, <i>No shit, Sherlock</i>, before he breaks into the light laughter that George has heard so many times before; it still gives him a warm feeling inside to have enticed such a reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring a jumper?\u201d George starts, tone teasing, \u201cTo England? In the middle of winter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so dumb.\u201d George throughly enjoys sing-songing back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Dream tells him in an undoubtedly defensive tone, forever drawn in to arguments with those who question his intelligence, \u201cIt\u2019s at the bottom of my suitcase, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Considering their options, George suddenly comes up with a suggestion. He starts moving and implementing it before he even asks, pulling up the hem of his jumper and making sure that his undershirt stays in place as Dream stares across at him both curiously and confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear to God, you\u2019ll freeze to death,\u201d George insists, \u201cHere, take mine instead...\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s giving him a questioning raised eyebrow and George continues, \u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s yours anyway, so... it\u2019ll fit.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s watching Dream\u2019s face and for a good few seconds he receives a absent and misty look that he can\u2019t quite place. </p>\n<p>It soon rapidly turns once George has the pale-blue material of the hoodie bunched up under his armpits, ready to bring it over his head. He never gets to this part, however, as two large hands reach out and clutch onto his own to stop him.</p>\n<p>Their eyes lock together for a couple of seconds before they both seem to fully appraise the situation. George can\u2019t help but glance down at where Dream\u2019s hand is entirely <i>engulfing</i> his own. </p>\n<p>Despite the situation currently, they\u2019re amazingly warm, so George is a little disappointed when Dream\u2019s bright eyes widen in recognition of his actions and he slowly retracts them from George. </p>\n<p>However, neither appear to be able to drag their gazes away just yet. George thinks he might see some colour returning to Dream\u2019s cold skin when a dusting of light pink appears on his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d The taller man protests, the removal of his hands being replaced with him stepping closer to George anyway, \u201cUh, keep it on,\u201d </p>\n<p>Either Dream is so cold his teeth are physically chattering, or he\u2019s tripping up over his words again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt suits you, baby,\u201d George is going to <i>PASS OUT</i>, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Dream realises he\u2019s about to protest, he continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want <i>you</i> to be cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has to finally break the increasingly intense eye contact at this point because George can literally feel himself melting away.</p>\n<p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d He manages, twisting his body around to face the exit again, he clears his throat and asks, desperate to change the topic and save his poor restless heart, \u201cMy car\u2019s this way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream nods down and across at him. There\u2019s a quirk pulling upwards at one side of his lips and George can\u2019t decide if such a smile is fond or teasing. He supposes he\u2019s fine with both. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d Dream announces, dragging his suitcase back behind him as they brave the winter air. </p>\n<p>If you ask George why he keeps so close to Dream that they practically rub shoulders as they cross the car park, he\u2019ll tell you some rubbish about body heat, or not wanting to get lost. But really, George wants to keep reminding himself that this is real.</p>\n<p>This is all real. Him and Dream. Together, finally. This is real, and he\u2019s so, <i>so</i> happy his heart could burst.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An hour later and they\u2019re already entering George\u2019s apartment. He feels weirdly subconscious about showing Dream the whole thing, knowing the other lived in his rather luxurious family home, but Dream is excitedly and animatedly bounding around from room to room, even despite his (as deemed by Dream himself) \u2018long-ass flight\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Ah</i>,\u201d Dream says triumphantly after finally opening the door to George\u2019s office, \u201cThe famous set up.\u201d</p>\n<p>George giggles at his ridiculous over-the-topness and these only intensify seeing Dream place himself down excitedly in his chair, shooting him a gleaming, white grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d George asks, because he certainly is and he\u2019s not the one who\u2019s been on a plane journey today.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoo, yes please,\u201d Dream replies, standing up from where he was seated, his tallness hitting George again by surprise, now seeing it in comparison to his own apartment, \u201cThe plane food was so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>George laughs, agreeing with him because he can definitely imagine. </p>\n<p>\u201cPizza?\u201d He asks once Dream reaches him at the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cPizza.\u201d The other agrees with a large, slanted smile on his face. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily, it only takes about twenty minutes for their food to arrive, the pizza place being situated only down the road from George\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p>Whilst unstacking the boxes on the kitchen table, he announces, \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely bought too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream shakes his head at him, grinning, \u201cI think you\u2019re underestimating me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rolling his eyes, George picks up as many boxes as he can and carries them to the coffee table in front of his couch. Dream follows with the rest in his arms.</p>\n<p>They start unboxing it all and a delicious aroma floods the air making George\u2019s hungry mouth water. The two of them look up at each other from across the couch and catch eyes, both widened in glee from the tempting scent and they can\u2019t help but to fall into laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bought a margarita?!\u201d </p>\n<p>Dream exclaims, sounding almost offended, handing George\u2019s box over when he opens it. George accepts it graciously, mouth watering, but is still able to defend himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes I did-,\u201c George starts, speaking quickly because he knows Dream will try and butt in (and he does, George just speaks louder), \u201cIt\u2019s good, okay? The extra toppings just get in the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>By this, he\u2019s referring to Dream\u2019s pizza which is currently loaded with various types of meat from beef to chicken and beyond. He doesn\u2019t care for such creations; George prefers the classics.</p>\n<p>Dream takes a large bite of his slice of pizza before he protests, tutting loudly, \u201cBut it\u2019s so <i>plaaaain</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their debate continues for around sixty percent of their dinner, before George suggests they turn on a film.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you wanna watch?\u201d George asks as he watches Dream devour the last piece of garlic bread, reaching for potato wedge from the portion they\u2019d decided to share and dipping it in to the sauce at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dream says helpfully through a muffled mouthful of food, \u201cAn action film, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>George screws his face up in disgust, \u201cEw, you like shitty action films?\u201d</p>\n<p>The taller man lets out a hearty laugh before he replies as he closes another empty pizza box, with a glint in his eye, \u201cI like <i>making fun</i> of shitty action films, there\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, George agrees, chuckling along with him too as he clicks on the first action movie that comes up when he opens Netflix. </p>\n<p>About ten minutes in, George can only think about just how freaking bad this film is, but also only about Dream\u2019s silly little laugh at his own jokes and comments as they go along. Admittedly, he may spend more time looking anywhere other than the screen in front of them. </p>\n<p>Approximately halfway through, they take a break, as requested by Dream (surprisingly), to put all their discarded boxes in the bin. He was right, George <i>did</i> underestimate his eating abilities.</p>\n<p>They settle back on George\u2019s comfy and plush couch, one at either end but essentially side-by-side due to the small amount of room.</p>\n<p>Suddenly left without anything to do, George\u2019s hands fiddle with the hems of his hoodie\u2019s sleeves as he guffaws at something stupid Dream says <i>again</i>. He lets his head fall back onto the cushions of the sofa and, soon, George can feel the heavy temptation of sleep; his eyelids shutting hanging over him.</p>\n<p>He does for a brief second, even though he\u2019s determined to push through at least until the end of the film because <i>Dream</i> is here and he can\u2019t waste any precious second, but he ends up jolting himself awake again as his head falls forward abruptly.</p>\n<p>This must have caught Dream\u2019s eye because the next thing he knows there\u2019s a short and odd silence, so out of place that George feels the need to say something, but then he feels a light and tentative tap on the side of his arm from Dream\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>Upon looking over, George finds that Dream has sunk down against the back of the couch to enable his long and lanky body to lie sideways, still able to look at the TV screen. This is not it, however, as the arm Dream is not currently leaning on as a head-rest is opened widely and George immediately knows exactly what it is: an invitation.</p>\n<p>Bordering on the edge of consciousness, it doesn\u2019t take much for George to give in, shoving all thoughts to the back of his mind for the morning to deal with. </p>\n<p>He watches Dream\u2019s face carefully as he begins to lower himself down in front of him, worried he may have misinterpreted somehow. Dream\u2019s features don\u2019t change from their relaxed and expectant expression, so George takes that as a good sign. </p>\n<p>The other\u2019s slanted grin directed his way quickens his heart even further as he lowers himself in front of Dream, facing towards the television and pressing his back to Dream\u2019s broad chest. </p>\n<p><i>Warmth</i>, is the reaction he processes in his fatigued state before he finally shuts his eyes to bask in it.</p>\n<p>His breathing evens out, and soon, he can literally feel himself drifting into a deep and much-needed sleep. </p>\n<p>One of the last things he feels before succumbing to his exhausted body\u2019s needs is Dream\u2019s free arm curling over his waist and hooking George\u2019s body even closer to his, palm splayed across his hoodie-covered chest.</p>\n<p>George can\u2019t work out whether Dream still knows he\u2019s partially awake, or if he thinks he\u2019s already fallen fast asleep. </p>\n<p>Perfectly aligned on the couch to just about both fit on, the close proximity also allows Dream to bury his face in George\u2019s dark hair, breathing in his scent before releasing his own contented hum.</p>\n<p>Snuggling and pushing back closer to the warm and solid body behind him, George responds with one of his own, letting the stress of the previous week melt away as he finally drifts into the welcome darkness completely.</p>\n<p>George sleeps better than he has in a long while. He wakes up warm, with a pleasant feeling encircling his chest, and his face buried into the cushions of the couch... wait, couch? </p>\n<p><i>Oh</i>.</p>\n<p>His eyes fly open a little too quickly for the morning, leaving him a bit dizzy when he tries to focus on the settings around him, when suddenly there\u2019s movement from behind him of someone shuffling on the couch. </p>\n<p>Then George remembers.</p>\n<p>Trying his best to remain perfectly still, as not to wake the other, George listens to Dream emit intelligible mumbles before tightening the arm he still has slung over George\u2019s waist. </p>\n<p>George lets himself get pulled closer to the other man\u2019s firm chest and shows a small smile when he can feel his soft breaths coming from behind him and tickling his hair.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t believe they slept the whole night like this, especially Dream; he can feel where the other\u2019s legs have had to bunch up massively because the length of his couch wasn\u2019t made for six foot three giants to fall asleep on. Dream\u2019s legs have become entangled with his throughout the night, locking George even more securely against him.</p>\n<p>George closes his eyes, perfectly happy to fall back asleep in Dream\u2019s warm and comforting embrace, but he lets out a small sigh because he knows he <i>should</i> get up. He really should. He doesn\u2019t want to make it weird later on in the morning if Dream were to wake up first and <i>not</i> like the fact that George has remained the entire night snuggled up against him.</p>\n<p>He moves slowly and carefully, not wanting to stir the other man, knowing that not only has he suffered an eight hour plane journey to get here, but his sleeping schedule is normally non-existent anyway. Dream needs a good rest and George is determined to let him have it.</p>\n<p>His first attempt to extradite himself involves sliding out from under Dream\u2019s sleep-heavy arm, but when he initiates his plan it is immediately furrowed by Dream pulling him in closer again.</p>\n<p>Soon, George realises that perhaps a faster movement would be better, like ripping off a plaster, so he quickly rolls himself off of the side of his couch onto his, luckily, carpeted floor. Dream\u2019s hand successfully slips off him and George misses the warmth straight away, but his second attempt appears entirely successful apart from an admittedly cute and grumpy mumble that comes from Dream.</p>\n<p>The man looks so calm and peaceful sleeping soundly on George\u2019s sofa, a stark difference to the loud and energetic persona he consistently portrays on screen. With a fond smile, George turns to the kitchen to see what he can supply for breakfast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream walks into the kitchen no less than thirty minutes later, still, George is happy he allowed the man some much needed sleep.</p>\n<p>George is currently not-so-successfully attempting to make pancakes, thinking it would make a nice surprise, but now he\u2019s cursing his decision. The mix keeps either over-sticking to the pan or remaining too runny and George can almost feel steam coming out of his ears from the frustration.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s attempting to scrape his failed third attempt out of the pan and into the bin, Dream unfortunately walks in. It takes a moment for George to feel a bit embarrassed at his lack of cooking skills, however, because he\u2019s too busy looking at the taller\u2019s groggy appearance.</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s golden-blond hair is sticking out in all directions, leaning slightly towards one side where the other had been pressed to the arm of the couch all night. He squints his eyes under the harsh white-lights of George\u2019s kitchen and brings a slow hand to rub at them half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d</p>\n<p>Sparks shoot down his spine at Dream\u2019s morning voice, tone lower and more gravelly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHaving trouble?\u201d He asks, mouth forming a lazy grin as he crosses the threshold.</p>\n<p>Sighing, George nods defeatedly, he does need help after all, otherwise all they\u2019ll have to eat will be a partly inedible concoction of flour and eggs. He\u2019s kind of sad though, he wanted to do something nice for the other man after he\u2019d come all this way to see him.</p>\n<p>George laughs a little, then sighs, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, let me try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream walks up next to him, taking control of the blazing hob and George happily lets him. Their shoulders bump idly, side-to-side, as George watches intently from beside him, studying Dream\u2019s skilful (and definitely not attractive) hands as he easily distributes the mixture in the pan evenly.</p>\n<p>Laughter bubbles out of the taller\u2019s mouth when he turns to see George\u2019s involuntary face of amazement.</p>\n<p><i>Of course Dream would be good at making pancakes,</i> He thinks, trying to withhold his eye-roll of annoyance, <i>He\u2019s good at everything.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cI cook them sometimes for my siblings,\u201d Dream explains, holding the pan at a particular (and probably, knowing him, well calculated) angle for the pancake to heat up evenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I flip it?\u201d</p>\n<p>George had not even considered doing such a thing, planning to go at it with a spatula in hand, but he certainly trusts Dream more with flipping the pancake than himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over-dramatically, Dream prepares himself, taking in a deep breath and causing George to laugh. He takes the pan away from the hob and throws it up into the air, George hopes it all stays intact for the sake of his kitchen floor. </p>\n<p>Of course, Dream catches the pancake perfectly and precisely and, of course, he makes a large, silly grin at George as he does so, causing George\u2019s heart to race.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d The taller says through happy bursts of laughter, maintaining eye-contact with George as he replaces the pan on the hob, \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p>\n<p>George rolls his eyes at his behaviour, but not without an uncontrollable smile, and seats himself at the breakfast bar, across from where Dream is standing. He rests his chin in his hands and quickly feels himself reddening as Dream continues to stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>George asks, desperate to break the silence before he overheats. He watches Dream\u2019s smile stretch even wider than before, slightly shaking his head before answering.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d George gives him a raised eyebrow like he doesn\u2019t quite believe him. Dream\u2019s eyes are cutely scrunching up into the grin now too, \u201cI\u2019m just... really, really happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heart pounding against his chest at a million miles an hour, George luckily manages to reply in a somewhat sturdy, audible voice and with a soft smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too.\u201d </p>\n<p>Then he repeats the words again and again in his mind because he truly means it. </p>\n<p><i>Me too</i>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They decide to spend Dream\u2019s first day in London sightseeing, because how can you not when visiting a city with such a notorious history. </p>\n<p>George enjoys the first half of the morning, visiting famous landmarks such as Big Ben and Saint Paul\u2019s Cathedral with plenty of beautiful architecture and views to ogle at. He doesn\u2019t, however, enjoy the second half quite so much, as Dream had dragged him to the London Dungeons, although Dream is currently claiming it to be the best part of their day so far.</p>\n<p>George suspects it might have something to do with the fact that he kept emitting loud screams at each actor they encountered that tried to jump scare them. </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t mind so much in the end, however, as Dream had eventually offered him his hand in support to allow them to make it through to the end. George had clutched on tightly, refusing to let go until they saw the light of day again. His heart had fluttered when Dream had just let him do so, even using his thumb to rub the back of George\u2019s hand soothingly after he jumps out of his skin.</p>\n<p>The loss of the warmth of Dream\u2019s hand as they reach the surface again is disappointing, but in this moment George is just thankful to be out of that wretched place.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream says as they walk back out into the streets of London, he\u2019s still chuckling and wheezing from the fact that George had literally clutched so tightly onto his arm and hid behind him at the last (and particularly scary, in George\u2019s defence) jump scare.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was <i>scary</i>.\u201d George protests, purposely hitting his shoulder into Dream\u2019s and displaying his best pout.</p>\n<p>Dream laughs again, \u201cOh, come on. It wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giving him a reproachful look, George replies, tone defensive, \u201cIt was!-\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to carry on when he\u2019s stopped dead in his tracks by Dream slipping his arm over his shoulders easily and tugging George back towards him, so close that their sides touch as they walk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dream begins, looking down at George, pleased smirk on full show, \u201cBut you had <i>me</i> to protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>George knows that Dream is teasing, but he can\u2019t help but admit that it had felt that way to him; Dream means <i>safe</i>, Dream means <i>protection</i>. He can\u2019t help but associate the two.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d He just sighs, leaning his head slightly backwards onto Dream\u2019s arm just because he can and it\u2019s comfortable. </p>\n<p>A small laugh from the taller man follows as he seems to recognise George\u2019s admitted defeat. They walk together for about a minute more before Dream pipes up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He asks, arm still around George, so their faces end up very close when George turns to look at him, \u201cDo you know where we\u2019re going? I hope you do, because I certainly don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giggling at him, George tells him that of course he does and that it\u2019s a <i>surprise</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Dream questions, curiosity obviously peaked, \u201cIs it food? I\u2019m really hungry, I hope it\u2019s food.\u201d</p>\n<p>George lets out a laugh again.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re non-stop when you\u2019ve had a sufficient amount of sleep, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He watches Dream\u2019s eyes scrunch up in the cute way that George has recently come to love and feels a warm and pleasant flood throughout his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dream agrees happily, but bounding a few paces ahead of George in his excitement, meaning they finally become detached, \u201cYou love it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>George rolls his eyes, but can\u2019t refrain from thinking, <i>Yes I do, unfortunately.</i></p>\n<p>They reach their destination soon after, rounding the corner of the long street they were walking down to find fairy lights neatly situated overhead in the next street.</p>\n<p>George watches the taller man as he glances up in amazement, the warm hue of the lights shadowing his handsome face in pleasing ways and the angle perfectly highlighting the sharpness of his jaw.</p>\n<p>Dream even emits a soft, little, \u201cWoah.\u201d and it completely warms George\u2019s heart for him to know that Dream had had the very same reaction that he had when he first stumbled across this smaller and less busy street of the capital.</p>\n<p>Toothy grin on show, the taller man turns back to George to ask him where they\u2019re going again. This time, George is able to simply point at the restaurant across the street from them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a small and very aesthetically pleasing building hid away in the corner of the street, it\u2019s quite hard to find but is amazingly popular among locals and regulars. George has only been here once before, let in to this little secret of London by some of his school friends, but it was such a lovely experience with lovely food that he knew he just <i>had</i> to share his second visit with someone who means a lot to him, and now he finally gets to.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d Dream comments as they\u2019re stepping inside, taking in the warm and luxurious interior. Soon, he realises what George has been waiting for him to realise, \u201cOH! This is a sushi place?\u201d</p>\n<p>A blinding and pleased smile works its way across George\u2019s face at Dream\u2019s visible excitement, turning to face him as he asks, allowing George to see the awed glint in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d George confirms, unable to suppress his happy grin as a waiter offers to take their coats. Dream seems surprised at the level of service, letting the man take his coat yet the the interaction leaving him in a bit of a daze.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this place, like... fancy?\u201d</p>\n<p>George laughs at his careful choice of words before reassuring him, \u201cNot really, just a bit upmarket with their service and food and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want Dream to think they\u2019re underdressed or anything, standing in the restaurant currently in their jeans and hoodies. George had purposely picked such a place; not so fancy that it feels like it\u2019s some sort of date or something (it\u2019s not, he reminds himself, even if it\u2019s felt that way the whole day to him), but fancy enough to show that George feels this is a special occasion.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re eventually seated at George\u2019s favourite table, despite only having been there once, beside the window and tucked into the corner away from other diners. The menus are handed to them promptly and George takes a quick look, even though he already knows what he wants, before exchanging this in return for the view of Dream intently studying the list before him.</p>\n<p>His green eyes flick up and down the menu and his tongue makes an appearance every now and then, wetting his lips; George is slightly mesmerised.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge.\u201d</p>\n<p>The call of his name has him crashing back down to earth.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI literally do not know what any of these meals are,\u201d George chuckles at his serious tone and Dream\u2019s voice immediately lightens up, protesting, \u201cI told you! I\u2019ve only ever had crappy Walmart sushi! This is proper,\u201d</p>\n<p>He gestures to the menu, looking back down briefly and up again before promptly returning back to the menu with wide eyes, doing a double-take.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd <i>EXPENSIVE</i>. Is this okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>George is smiling widely again, charmed by the man before him under the soft and gentle lights of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d He tells him, voice level and sure as their eyes reconnect, \u201cI\u2019m paying.\u201d</p>\n<p>George thinks Dream malfunctions, seeing his facial features falter for a second or two. He finds it incredibly funny.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, no-\u201c Dream begins protesting, just as George had expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou literally spent hundreds on a flight to come see me,\u201d He tells him, speaking loudly as to drown Dream\u2019s objections out, \u201cThe least I can do is buy you a nice dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seemingly considering this for a second, Dream maintains their eye contact whilst narrowing his own a little. It makes George\u2019s heart beat faster, but it soon slows again when Dream seems to make up his mind, nodding slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <i>fine</i>.\u201d He relents, still not sounding too entirely happy about not contributing, but George will take it as a win.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a short silence as George takes the opportunity to beam happily at him and his victory, then Dream breaks it again with a chuckled and sheepish, \u201cI still don\u2019t know what to order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust get the same as me?\u201d George proposes, kicking his foot lightly under the table, \u201cIt\u2019s good, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream grins back at him and taps his leg back as he agrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that night, he informs him that it was, in fact, very delicious indeed as they bundle through the entrance of George\u2019s apartment rather ungracefully, running high on adrenaline from their big trip to the city.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve had a long day and George feels not only physically tired, but his cheeks hurt from smiling and laughing all day too. He\u2019s locking up the door when Dream tells him he\u2019s going to get changed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI smell of,\u201d He takes an exaggerated sniff of his coat as he places it back on the rack and George screws up his nose from experience, \u201cWait, do I even want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>George giggles, chucking his keys onto the side, \u201cProbably not. That\u2019s London for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLovely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Following the taller man down the hallway, George intends to do the same, eager to remove the weird mix of sweat and pollution that\u2019s always picked up on the Underground however hard you try to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Dream veers off to the left, into George\u2019s spare room (that he hasn\u2019t, ironically, spent a night in yet) and he continues further on into his own room.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stop <i>smiling</i>. George is starting to think maybe this will turn into a problem soon, but he\u2019s so, so happy that he refuses to analyse it on a deeper level yet.</p>\n<p>Opening his drawers, he selects his comfiest and favourite pair of pyjama bottoms and shrugs on a random t-shirt with it, fully intending to slip Dream\u2019s hoodie on too. </p>\n<p>He daren\u2019t wear it outside today due to the fact that it would\u2019ve probably got contaminated too by the murky London air and it is <i>definitely</i> too precious for him to risk that happening.</p>\n<p>Idly, he scrolls through his phone for a minute before an influx of texts start coming through from Sapnap (or \u2018Snapmap\u2019 as George has so gracefully named him in his contacts) about both his and Dream\u2019s lack of communication with anyone for the past couple of days.</p>\n<p>One literally says he\u2019s going to \u2018die from the suspense\u2019 of awaiting their answers, but a yawn flies out of George\u2019s mouth and he reasons that his friend can at least hold out till the morning. He\u2019s putting his phone on charge and to the side when he hears a call from the other room.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge? Could you-\u201d He\u2019s already up on his feet and at the doorway of the spare room before the latter half is spoken. Dream laughs at his haste.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d George asks with a quirked smile, suddenly feeling sheepish and folding his arms under his armpits.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, um,\u201d George\u2018s smile soon falters because he\u2019s not a fan of Dream\u2019s more serious tone at all. It doesn\u2019t help that he can\u2019t even see the taller\u2019s face at the moment as he\u2019s turned back to his spread-out suitcase on the bed and is currently digging through it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d give me my hoodie back?\u201d</p>\n<p>George can feel his whole face pale, his heart rate has slowed to the absolute minimum as he desperately tries to chase the meaning of Dream\u2019s words round and round in his head. </p>\n<p>His arms fall from where they are tucked up under his sides and rest motionless beside him before he starts picking at the hem of said hoodie, bunching the material hard in his fist. Suddenly, it doesn\u2019t feel so warm anymore, as if a cold gust had swept him up and carried him away.</p>\n<p>He feels his lips quiver, but he bites them just a bit too hard to make them stop, reminding himself that the hoodie doesn\u2019t mean to Dream what it does for him. It\u2019s just fabric, interwoven cloth that serves a functional purpose, not <i>theirs</i>, his.</p>\n<p>Dream doesn\u2019t like him, at least, not in the way a minuscule piece of George\u2019s brain had slowly started to hope and think from all the... <i>God.</i> He\u2019s such an idiot.</p>\n<p>Eyes stinging with the beginnings of tears he\u2019s desperate not to let slip, George takes a large gulp of air before he attempts to speak. It\u2019s not enough, he still feels like he can\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh-\u201d The simple agreement catches in his throat, he clears it abruptly and scrunches up his eyes as he feels tears threaten again, \u201cO-okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>The corners of his mouth have dropped for the first time in what feels like a week, George immediately misses the giddy emotion he\u2019d been riding high on ever since that first day. He yearns for it.</p>\n<p>When he finally glances up again, after a series of rapid blinks at the carpeted floor, George watches as Dream finally turns to him and sees his green eyes become wide as they meet his.</p>\n<p>Concern and confusion flash over Dream\u2019s face as he immediately begins to hurry over to George before he suddenly stops in his tracks, realisation dawning on his features. </p>\n<p>His jaw drops minutely lower and his worried eyes fly wider open as he hurriedly begins to backtrack himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d His voice is heavy and apologetic as he speaks. Dream moves forwards a bit more and gestures with his hands as he speaks, \u201cOh no, no, <i>baby</i>, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a second, George thinks the taller is going to grab his hands before he seemingly changes his mind, turning on his heel back to the suitcase, rummaging through it more rapidly. </p>\n<p>George can\u2019t help but let out a pathetic sniffle as he watches helplessly from behind, pale-blue material still clutched between his fingers. He\u2019s so confused and he doesn\u2019t know where to look, what to do or even what to think. </p>\n<p>His gaze does not waver from Dream\u2019s broad shoulders, however, and the other seems to stop for second in his movements as he seems to stumble across what he was looking for.</p>\n<p>George\u2019s body moves of its own accord, drawing him forward and closer towards Dream, away from the doorframe he\u2019d been using to steady himself this whole time. </p>\n<p>What feels like hours to George in this moment is really only a few seconds; Dream turns back to face him and is looking at him with with an uncharacteristically unsure smile that pulls higher into his left cheek than the right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, um,\u201d Dream is scratching the back of his head and is holding a something neatly folded in his tightly clutched hands before him. George still has no idea what\u2019s going on, \u201cI thought you might... might want a new one, you know. That, uh, smells more like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Immediately, George\u2019s failing body bursts back into colourful action. He drops his handfuls of his hoodie as he holds contact with Dream\u2019s wavering eyes and can feel the return of his pounding heart close against his chest. </p>\n<p>He watches, dazed, as Dream displays what he\u2019s holding in his hands: another hoodie, just as soft, large and probably as comforting as the one of Dream\u2019s he\u2019s had for weeks now, only this time it\u2019s a charming and familiar chartreuse green.</p>\n<p>A relieving warmth spreads its way soothingly across his entire body, wrapping its way across every square inch of his skin and his mind screeches to an unexpected and stupefying halt.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Oh.</i>\n</p>\n<p>George looks more closely up into Dream\u2019s green and glittering eyes, searching for something, anything, that should stop him from carrying out his next move in this moment, but he finds none.</p>\n<p>He makes two quick steps forwards and then he\u2019s right there, in front of Dream, flinging his arms around the taller\u2019s shoulders and pulling him in by the neck to meet George\u2019s lips in a crushing and passionate kiss.</p>\n<p>Instantly, George feels as if fireworks are ignited within him, sending sparks of heat from the core of his body to the length of all his extremities. His fingers finally feel just how <i>soft</i> the ends of Dream\u2019s dirty-blond hair are and the smoothness of the other\u2019s skin against his own.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a couple of awful seconds when George starts to think he\u2019s made a terrible mistake, that Dream is going to push him off and glare at him with disgust and confusion in his eyes. But then it happens. </p>\n<p>Dream emits a light gasp of surprise against George\u2019s pink lips, reaching his hands out to grab at either sides of his waist to make sure that this is real. That this is <i>actually</i> happening. </p>\n<p>Grabbing on tightly to George\u2019s sides and pulling him closer towards him, he parts his mouth widely against George\u2019s and administers a deeper, sweet and lingering kiss. Their mouths to slide together in a delectable way that has George hum delightedly against Dream\u2019s mouth as his hands dig deeper into the flesh of the taller\u2019s back and weave upwards into his messy blond hair.</p>\n<p>The taller\u2019s lips are soft and warm against his own, sending pleasant shivers up and down his spine making him feel continuously tingly. And just when George thinks he manages to get used to that, Dream pulls back a little before diving back in with his tongue, lavishly tasting his own and erupting another pleased sound out of George.</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s hands wander idly down his sides, electrifying every inch of his body when they meet the slither of skin exposed between his hoodie and bottoms. The taller takes the opportunity when George parts his lips to emit a small gasp to deepen the kiss even further </p>\n<p>George slides his hands from where they were carding through Dream\u2019s soft hair to land on either sides of the taller\u2019s face, cupping his sharp jaw and flushed cheeks fondly as he shyly and tentatively pushes back against Dream\u2019s mouth, allowing himself to become fully immersed in this moment, intent on remembering it all perfectly, as it should be.</p>\n<p>They part for breath and George slowly lets his eyes open, afraid that if he does it too quickly he\u2019ll just wake up to find this whole day has been a dream. </p>\n<p>When he does, however, he finds the most beautiful and handsome sight; Dream is looking down at him, affection and awe clearly glimmering in his eyes, he also has the widest and most giddy smile George has ever seen stretched across his face, as if it\u2019s uncontrollable.</p>\n<p>Eyes fully open now, George stares intently up at Dream, words failing him as he maps the breathtaking image into his mind. Dream still rubbing light and distracting circles into the exposed expanse of his skin certainly isn\u2019t helping, but he\u2019s sure he\u2019s grinning just as stupidly and wide back right now. </p>\n<p>Their bodies are so close together George almost feels as if they are intertwined, sharing body heat and breathing air. Dream speaks first, sounding just as out of breath as George feels, thankfully.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>George, I</i>-\u201c</p>\n<p>Feeling bold, he pushes up on his tiptoes again and interrupts Dream with another kiss. It\u2019s entirely worth it, he decides, when he pulls back to find Dream\u2019s face flushing a dark red again.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Dream tries again with a sigh, flexing his grip around George\u2019s waist again and glancing down into his faux-innocent eyes, \u201cLet me just-\u201c</p>\n<p>George giggles again as he butts in again but this time with a longer and more lasting kiss. He feels Dream hum in protest against his lips, but his body is soon pulled even more taut against the taller\u2019s broad and firm chest as he eagerly licks back into George\u2019s open mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge!\u201d He calls again, muffled by the other\u2019s lips, softly but still an exclamation as he slides his own hands up to hook behind George\u2019s head, playing with the hair at the nape of his neck softly. His eyes are filled with glee and exhilaration as he speaks, \u201cStop it and let me tell you that <i>I like you</i>, godammit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heart somehow managing to flutter, pound and burst suddenly at the same time, an involuntary and ecstatic grin flies onto George\u2019s face as he hears the words finally said. </p>\n<p>He kind of forgets how to function for a few seconds before he eventually jerks back to action, running a thumb across the skin of Dream\u2019s flushed and tanned cheek as he tells him in a teasing tone, \u201cYeah, I kind of got that.\u201d</p>\n<p>George lets a cheeky lopsided grin bloom on his face and Dream emits a burst of laughter before he tells him in a low and fond tone, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d before he\u2019s leaning back down again to capture George\u2019s lips in a lingering and luscious kiss that quickly stifles the other\u2019s bubbling laughter. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>About an hour later, they find themselves snuggled deep within the comfy sheets of the bed in the spare room. George is not only warm from the quilted sheets, but also from the soft hands tracing up and down his body as Dream lazily kisses him, faces tucked against the pillows.</p>\n<p>George\u2019s hands, seeking warmth after having been cupping the other\u2019s cheek, now move to Dream\u2019s chest, splaying flat against the firm expanse. Immediately, he can feel a rush of blood back to his fingers (as well as the taller\u2019s defined lines of muscle under his hoodie) and George lets out a happy and contented hum into their kiss.</p>\n<p>The sensation is almost familiar to him now, having been making out with Dream practically non-stop since he had made a gracious leap of faith. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t keep their hands off each other and George feels like a lovesick teen all over again, only this time it\u2019s a hundred times better.</p>\n<p>When they pull back slightly and George takes the opportunity to study Dream\u2019s face, his mind races at the picture he makes. Lips red and partly swollen from the heat of their kisses, golden-blond hair truly mussed, falling prettily across his face, and that stupid pleased grin stretched across his cheeks; George knows what that grin means now.</p>\n<p>He watches patiently as Dream\u2019s gleaming eyes roam over his features too. George is sure he looks not too different in appearance, as he catches the look of fond admiration in Dream\u2019s gaze, and takes the opportunity to slide his hands down to the hem of the other\u2019s jumper, placing his cold hands there purposely to make him jolt against him. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Dream exclaims in surprise as his body jerks upwards and away from George\u2019s icy hand, reacting on innate instinct. He soon supplies him with an over-dramatised glare and a drawn out whine of, \u201cOwww,\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s grin maintains, pleased and beaming, \u201c<i>Please</i> don\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOw?\u201d George teases, rolling his eyes as he slips his hand over the side of Dream\u2019s body to pull them closer together, \u201cI thought you were meant to be <i>tough</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream splutters a little before raising his chin upwards to move his head away to think, mouth forming a small and cute pout.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou caught me off-guard, though,\u201d He insists, shifting against George and turning his body so that they fit even more perfectly together, yin and yang, \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p>\n<p>George just tuts as he nuzzles his face into Dream\u2019s neck before he feels mischievous and begins to leave little, gentle kisses there.</p>\n<p>He can feel the entirety of the taller\u2019s body tense against him and he presses a stretched smile against his skin. Dream\u2019s hands on his waist clutch more tightly and there\u2019s a sharp intake of breath from above him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Dream breathes out lightly, a hand reaching up to slide through George\u2019s hair as his mouth continues to suck gently on his exposed skin, \u201c<i>Baby</i>,\u201d he then emits, more as a moan than anything, and George can feel a smirk pulling at his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you keep doing that...\u201d </p>\n<p>Dream finally says after George moves his head slightly away from the proximity of his red and flushing skin, trailing off and saying the rest with his sharp eyes. George feels heat pulling at his stomach and excitement bubbling through him, but he decides he has to take the moment and opportunity to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>At the change of topics, Dream looks confused, eyebrows furrowing downwards as he responds, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you call me \u2018baby\u2019?\u201d </p>\n<p>George finds it hard to look him in the eye as he says the word back to him, so he buries his head against the taller\u2019s chest this time. This means he can feel the moment Dream\u2019s breathing halts at the question too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, um...\u201d </p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s words quickly fall into silence so George tilts his head up in such a way that enables him to give the other man a questioning raised brow. His cheeks are a pretty shade of crimson, contrasting the bright white of the bedsheets beautifully; George can\u2019t stop smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d He starts again with an abrupt clearing of his throat, \u201cUh, the first time, it just, I don\u2019t know, kind of... happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fiddling with the drawstring of his new hoodie, George shoots him a patient look, encouraging him to go on. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then I saw how you reacted, blushing and going all shy and everything, and it just made me want to say it again and again,\u201d Dream\u2019s glancing down at him now, a soft grin stretching across his face.</p>\n<p><i>Dammit</i>. George thinks; his attempts of teasing the other have backfired. <i>Again</i>.</p>\n<p>His own features are lighting up a baby pink right now, for sure, and he\u2019s helpless in trying to avoid it. Dream\u2019s grinning even more widely down at him as he speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I told you that I love it when you wear my hoodies?\u201d</p>\n<p>He lands a light kiss into George\u2019s dark hair and tightens his grip around his middle with his strong hand.</p>\n<p>George can\u2019t withhold his smile as he looks up at Dream under his lashes and answers him softly, \u201cNot nearly enough times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to tell him.\u201d George says, but not wholeheartedly like he\u2019s fully intending to. </p>\n<p>He glances up at Dream\u2019s face from where his back is leaning against his warm chest on the sofa. Somehow, they\u2019d ended up snuggled on the couch together on a particularly chilly winter\u2019s morning, even though they had only been intertwined in the spare bed mere hours before.</p>\n<p>George had cooked Dream breakfast this time (and very successfully, may he add), serving a sizzling and delicious English breakfast consisting of sunny-side up eggs and perfectly browned toast among many other things.</p>\n<p>Dream had, unhelpfully, sat at the breakfast bar whilst George was focused on his cooking, staring at him intently and giving him soft smiles that made him blush when their eyes caught. But, George is just glad that he finally got to cook something nice for his... <i>boyfriend</i>?</p>\n<p>George suddenly realises they never really got to that part last night, distracted by... other things. He sits up and brings his head to align with the blond\u2019s, who turns to him with a questioning gaze.</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath, George decides quickly that it\u2019s just better to ask and know, than to suffer in his mental strife alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Dream, are we- um,\u201d His confidence suddenly diminishes at the crucial moment under his green-eyed gaze, \u201cI was just wondering if-\u201c</p>\n<p>The other man, who appears to have been watching him carefully, but with an amused smile and bright eyes, finishes for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re <i>together</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>George nods, unable to do anything else, playing with his hands in his lap and avoiding Dream\u2019s gaze. The way he says the word has his head running dizzy and heart skipping in too many ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Dream answers in a sure tone, like it was an undeniable fact. His face soon falls and his pitch lowers as he seems to realise something mid-sentence, \u201cThat\u2019s, uh, if you want to be... of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>George has to bite his lip to process the adorableness of the other falling over his words in front of him. Something only <i>he</i> can make this unstoppable and loud-mouthed man to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really do.\u201d </p>\n<p>He says sincerely, not letting a falter creep into his tone as he reaches for Dream\u2019s hand to grasp. He always forgets how <i>damn</i> big they are and how his own hands feel seemingly delicate when he holds them.</p>\n<p>A beaming smile sweeps back onto Dream\u2019s face and he wastes no time in grasping one side of George\u2019s face to pull him in for a sweet kiss. George sighs contentedly against him lips and inclines his head further towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dream says, substantiating it with another kiss, \u201c<i>Boyfriend</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>George is still grinning at his silliness and flushing red when he finally recalls their earlier conversation that had got swept away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to tell Sapnap soon,\u201d Dream gives him a few chuckles and a lazy grin at his words as he pulls them both back down to lie on the couch again, \u201cI\u2019m serious! He\u2019s literally sent me six death threats this past week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream lets out his familiar wheeze at George\u2019s <i>slight</i> over-exaggeration.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d George continues, pouting as he stares pointedly up at the sharp lines of Dream\u2019s face, \u201cI\u2019m starting to think he might just actually get on a plane to London at this rate.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what to read into it when his words cause Dream\u2019s arm around him to tighten and pull him closer into his chest, but he hazards a guess when he catches the taller\u2019s eyes and sends him a narrowed gaze that says, <i>\u2018Protective much?\u2019</i>, and Dream\u2019s face rapidly blushes shades of pink.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, and quite conveniently, Dream decides to answer, \u201cWell, how do you want to tell him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mulling it over in his busy brain, George rules out FaceTime straight away because his poor heart could not survive doing it face-to-face. He then further eliminates TeamSpeak, Discord, good old-fashioned phone calls and all things of the sort because then it somehow feels even worse if George <i>can\u2019t</i> see his facial expression, so you can see his clear dilemma.</p>\n<p>He voices this all to Dream who humours his ranting massively, looking upon his <i>boyfriend</i> with a soft and fond smile as he runs a hand lazily through his short, dark hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cText?\u201d He suggests half-heartedly. George considers it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little too underwhelming and impersonal?\u201d George asks, voice becoming higher and higher in pitch as his options narrow. Dream just lets out another hearty laugh, George scowls at him and whines, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to <i>dooo</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lies still, head on Dream\u2019s chest and full of rambling chaos; the only thing keeping him sane right now is probably the calming fingers carding lightly through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge,\u201d Dream says after a moment, breaking the settled, comfortable, silence, \u201cCould you pass me my phone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Complying, he grabs it from the coffee table that\u2019s just about in his reach and hands it up behind him to Dream. </p>\n<p>He hears the other fiddle with it for a bit after thanking him and is about to drift into a tranquil state of <i>not</i> thinking, when he\u2019s interrupted by Dream gently tapping the top of his head. </p>\n<p>George glances up quickly and is immediately met with a soft, yet brief, kiss to his cheek. His traitorous flesh flushes an all-too-familiar red, small laughs are incited from his chest and he\u2019s about to ask Dream what that was for when he realises.</p>\n<p>Glancing up at the phone Dream holds in his hand, now tapping away eagerly, George can see the photo has already been sent as a message to someone... three guesses who.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Dream!</i>\u201c</p>\n<p>George exclaims, making a feeble attempt to grab the phone out of his hands, like he could possibly reverse the taller\u2019s action anyway. When the device is promptly held out of his reach by long arms, he settles for an unimpressed death stare instead. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dream asks, laughter bubbling out of him like he\u2019s having the time of his life, \u201cYou said you wanted him to know,\u201d</p>\n<p>George keeps staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, now he does.\u201d Dream concludes in a content tone with a grin and a wave of his phone in the air, like all their problems have been solved. George shakes his head but can\u2019t get rid of his fond gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna kill both of us even more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Speaking of the devil, Dream\u2019s phone soon lights up with a call from the contact, \u2018Simpnap\u2019. George darts his gaze back to catch Dream\u2019s and finds a similarly surprised look.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, great,\u201d George says, giving up and leaning back down to rest against Dream\u2019s chest again, \u201cYou\u2019ve gone and done it now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Playfully putting a finger to George\u2019s lips to shush his muttering, the other answers the call, transferring it straight to speakerphone. </p>\n<p>At first, nothing is said directly down the line, only the hustle and bustle of some busy place audible in the background. Then comes Sapnap\u2019s heaven-splitting voice in a near yell.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I swear to God, DREAM,</i>\u201d </p>\n<p>George and said man share an expression of both amusement and grimace as they stare at the phone waiting for the younger to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m at <i>school</i> right now,\u201d Sapnap is shouting slightly less, but it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s out of exasperation or due to the level of noise, \u201cYou can\u2019t just drop that kind of news on me by <i>text</i>, dude, oh my God.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream finally lets out the loud and long wheeze he\u2019d apparently been attempting to hold back, George\u2019s giggles work their way out too, half nervous and half relieved to have it over and done with.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry?\u201d </p>\n<p>Dream supplies as a question, leaning towards the phone, even though he sounds nothing of the sort. Sapnap must easily pick up on this fact as he curses at him again, causing George\u2019s eyebrows to fly up as he looks over to Dream, who still appears to be throughly enjoying himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are <i>soooo</i> dumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs after a couple more minutes of George explaining themselves down the phone. Both Dream and George roll their eyes at Sapnap\u2019s cocky replies but remain silent as they can\u2019t really argue to the contrary.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Dream tells him, but his voice reflects the grin he has plastered across his face, \u201cAs if you knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>George can\u2019t help but laugh at Sapnap spluttering to defend himself down the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did! I did,\u201d He sounds slightly out of breath from the fast-pace of his words, \u201cGod, I\u2019m not <i>blind</i>. George wore your fricken\u2019 hoodie for you and you flew out to London for him! Like, c\u2019mon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blush rising quickly to his cheeks, George scrambles for the phone from Dream\u2019s hand, keen to cut Sapnap off before he can say anything more damming.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine! <i>Fine</i>, whatever, you knew about it first, you win. We\u2019re dumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream gives him a small poke of protest to the ribs; it soon turns to him tickling George\u2019s sides and the latter can\u2019t help but emit a loud, gleeful yelp.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you-,\u201d Sapnap starts before abruptly cutting himself off with a louder and plainer tone, \u201cNEVERMIND. I really don\u2019t want to know. Ew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dismissively, Dream tells him to shut up again through laughs and intermittent kisses to George\u2019s rosy cheeks, only this time with stronger and more expletive language.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, you absolute idiots\u201d Sapnap says, sounding rather conclusive and pleased with himself, just as a shrill bell sounds in the background, \u201cBut I do really have to go now.\u201d</p>\n<p>They chime a \u2018goodbye\u2019 in sync and Sapnap quietly tells them he loves them both before cutting off the call; George loves his friends so much, he decides as he displays a fond smile, but he loves one, in particular, more than the rest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, Dream,\u201d George mumbles into the hand covering his eyes and not doing a very good job of it, landing somehow over his mouth too, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears a small chuckle he incited from the other man behind him as he\u2019s marched along the street. George has tried to keep track of his left and right turns, figuring he might be able to work it out from that, but he had lost count when Dream had given him a lingering kiss on the lips to \u2018warm him up.\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s night now, about seven or eight in the evening. They had spent most of the day playing video games on the TV against each other, and George was delighted to find that although Dream could outwit him in Minecraft almost every time, George can absolutely destroy him at Mario Kart. </p>\n<p>As it can be imagined, Dream is a sore loser, exclaiming loud profanities and blaming poor item drops for his loss, but George maintains it\u2019s all down to his pure skill. The taller man was huffy with him for about the next ten minutes (he didn\u2019t mind too much as he thought that his pout was incredibly cute), but it didn\u2019t last long at all, Dream caving in quickly and apologising to George for shouting with sweet, sweet kisses all over his face.</p>\n<p>Dream had insisted on making dinner for them too, which was not too weird considering that they had soon established that he was definitely the better cook between them. But what was strange to George, however, was the fact that the other man seemed to almost rush him in eating his rather delicious spaghetti bolognese.</p>\n<p>He had been even more startled when Dream had piled him into his coat and out of the door as soon as possible afterwards too. Now leading him here, standing in the middle of the pavement of a busy London street with his <i>dumb</i> boyfriend\u2019s hands clamped over his eyes for a \u2018surprise\u2019. George dreads to even think.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a little longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>The taller promises, George\u2019s back coming flush with his chest as they slow down. They make another left, swerve to dodge a few people (who George is sure are looking at them very strangely, but right now he\u2019s frankly too intrigued to care) and the noise of mechanical traffic soon becomes drowned out by something else, something... louder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream announces happily abruptly parking George on an apparently acceptable piece of pathway. He has to squint his eyes at the bright and flashing lights he opens them up to, but soon enough, George is able to make out the sign.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d He laughs, turning to Dream with a sloppy grin on his face as the other comes to stand beside him, grabbing one of his hands softly, \u201cAre you taking me on a <i>date</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s grin widens at his words before he admits slowly, \u201c<i>Maybeee</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018Winter Wonderland\u2019, the bright flashing sign above them reads: London\u2019s biggest amusement park, only available in the Winter season and a hot spot for couples to frequent in the months leading up to Christmas. George had never been before, mainly because he\u2019s never really had anyone to go with. Now he has, he supposes with a smile.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s faint screams of adrenaline and delight that dance along the thin winter\u2019s air from the colourful rides. The sickeningly-sweet scent of fairground candy floss tickles the back of George\u2019s throat and the <i>pings</i> and <i>pops</i> of various games in the hundreds of booths flood his ears. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream asks him, studying his expression carefully as he rearranges their grip to be more firm. George has to bite his lip to tone down his blinding smile, but he reassures Dream with an enthusiastic nod, to which the other beams wider in relief.</p>\n<p>George swings their connected hands between them as he tugs Dream to follow him into the entrance. Obliging with a giddy laugh, Dream stumbles after him and immediately volunteers to pay for their tickets. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want ride tokens too?\u201d The cashier asks, dolling out change to Dream as said man stares at it intensely, probably trying to figure out the Sterling currency, George finally realises before cursing himself for letting the American take charge. All he can do is roll his eyes, though, because Dream is stubborn when it comes to getting things right.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh,\u201d Dream begins, reading the prices from beside him, \u201cJust enough for one ride each, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>George frowns because he knows they\u2019ve both expressed a dislike for rollercoasters and the like before to each other, Dream catches his questioning look but just waves him off with a mouthed, \u2018<i>Later</i>\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cashier hands over their tokens to Dream, who pockets them safely in the zip of his coat, before they thank her as they move beyond the barrier.</p>\n<p>George is about to ask when his attention is immediately grabbed by the bright lights around him; everything is glittering like jewels and even though George can\u2019t see the full spectrum of colours, he can tell that it\u2019s absolutely beautiful. Another question suddenly hits him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you even know about this place?\u201d He asks curiously, dark brown eyes flicking up to meet Dream\u2019s. He can\u2019t imagine London\u2019s \u2018Winter Wonderland\u2019 is the talk of the town in Florida, the home of about three of the nation\u2019s most famous theme parks alone.</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s face blushes, or maybe it\u2019s the cast of the red light over his features from above, and George continues looking at him to urge him on.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well,\u201d He starts with a cough and a little sheepish smile, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Already feeling the temptation of the corners of his mouth pulling upwards, George forces them back down quite unsuccessfully but nods his head diligently all the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I knew I was coming over here,\u201d Dream pauses a second and sighs like he doesn\u2019t want to admit it, \u201cUh, I did some research, on like, cute places to go,\u201d</p>\n<p>George is so going to break his promise not to laugh, he loves seeing Dream flustered for once.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I could...\u201d Dream breaks off into little laughs again, \u201cSo I could ask you out.\u201d he says finally, twisting his head away from George\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>Face physically scrunching up from the warmth and affection he feels from the other man\u2019s attempted action, George lifts his free hand to pull Dream\u2019s (handsome) face back towards him. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s biting his lip again and letting out small giggles as he teases, \u201cAwww, that\u2019s so <i>cuteee</i>,\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs even more as Dream dips his head again, almost in physical avoidance. He finishes softly, a little in disbelief at the realisation, \u201cYou were going to ask me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream huffs out a laugh before leaning his cheek against George\u2019s hand which is still lingering.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>,\u201d The other man half-mumbles, before springing into his usual, more defensive tone of protest, \u201cWe are <i>literally</i> going out, you can\u2019t tease me about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>George just coos at him again, insisting that he\u2019s adorable, when he realises, \u201cOh God, so when I ki-,\u201d He shifts his eyes from Dream\u2019s face as it morphs into a smirk, \u201cDid...<i>that</i>... ruin your plans?\u201d</p>\n<p>His tone actually becomes melancholy at his epiphany, sad that he messed up something nice that Dream was trying to do for him.</p>\n<p>Dream cheers him up by tugging him by the hand to walk beside him, bumping their shoulders together and laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of,\u201d Dream says speculatively, with a different kind of grin, before he returns back to his low (and very suggestive in the right context, may George add) voice, \u201cI\u2019d say it all worked out perfectly well, though. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>George smiles up at him, cheeks stretched to the absolute brim, as he answers, \u201cI would. I really, really would.\u201d </p>\n<p>The taller leans into his personal space as he smiles blindingly at him and clutches on more tightly to George\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so dumb.\u201d George tells him fondly because he can\u2019t help himself; it only earns a larger grin from the other man.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to do first?\u201d Dream asks, bringing them both to a halt in an area surrounded by dazzling and bustling booths, ranging from foods, souvenirs and beyond.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s scanning the area intensely when something soon catches his eye. However, his mind quickly supplies that the idea is stupid, so he tries to force his gaze onwards and away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one are you looking at?\u201d </p>\n<p>George sighs at Dream\u2019s masterful observation skills, especially applied when it comes to him, it seems, and gives him a raised eyebrow as he glances over to see the other\u2019s expectant expression. </p>\n<p>Telling half-truths of what had caught his eye, George supplies, \u201cWe could have a go at some games first?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream nods in agreement and they walk further into the noisy crowd and mouthy market-sellers. As they disappear further in, George finds it hard not to stare at what had caught his eye before: a substantially-sized teddy bear is displayed at the forefront of one of the most busy-looking stalls in the little square they\u2019re currently in. </p>\n<p>It had caught George\u2019s attention because it\u2019s a lovely shade of light blue and its soft and fluffy coat looks inviting and warm in the midst of harsh winter air. It takes George a little while to catch on as to why the bear interests him so much, he lets himself stare for another ten seconds and then it hits him.</p>\n<p>The bear is the exact same pale and sky-blue that pigments the soft material of Dream\u2019s hoodie. A colour he now, undoubtedly, associates with the other man; warmth, protection and <i>home</i>.</p>\n<p>The teddy-bear\u2019s blue fur glistens under the flashing lights of the stall. George is still staring. He can\u2019t stop thinking about how it would be the perfect physical representation of their precious time they\u2019ve had in London together, in <i>real life</i>. Something for him to have and to hold when a certain someone has to fly back, thousands of miles away.</p>\n<p>He snaps back to himself and looks up beside him to find Dream pondering something whilst regarding his face with great intrigue. </p>\n<p>Their eyes meet, Dream\u2019s dance hues of blue-green under the lights that George is very excited to find he is able to see. He can feel his own smile widening across his cheeks and can also <i>see</i> the exact moment that Dream makes up his mind about whatever he was considering, as his face morphs into an expression of stern and poised competitiveness.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to win it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s words are a statement of fact, not a careful question asked or even a conditional or an attempt. George\u2019s heart races at the taller\u2019s explicit confidence and assertiveness; something that has always made him feel a certain type of way.</p>\n<p>Just because he likes to be difficult and see Dream\u2019s intelligent mind at work, George questions, in a teasing and defiant tone, \u201cHow do you even know that I want it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream laughs like you\u2019d be an idiot not to, \u201cOh, come on.\u201d </p>\n<p>His challenging eyes glisten with the stall\u2019s Christmas lights slowly twinkling above them. George thinks he\u2019s quite beautiful, almost like a handsome and charming prince that\u2019s wandered straight out of a fairytale.</p>\n<p>A slight raise of the taller\u2019s eyebrow is all it takes for George to relent and follow Dream, a little nervously, as he marches up to the stall to play the game after paying.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of those well-loved basketball shooting games, where the hoop is situated a good few feet away from where you\u2019re told to stand, and all you have to do is get it in. Easy, right? </p>\n<p>Nope. George knows for a fact that the basketball hoop rings are such a size that one must be perfectly and near-impossibly accurate in order to actually win the game. He should know, he\u2019d worked at his town\u2019s local funfair for the summer once when he was still a teenager.</p>\n<p>Dream just gives him a playful wink as the stall-owner hands over three balls to him, because of course he would. This is Dream; an ex-American football quarterback with the killer confidence of a king.</p>\n<p>Said man\u2019s face morphs into a smirked expression of focus as he lines up his first shoot. George rolls his eyes at his over-dramatising boyfriend and just fondly tells him to shoot already.</p>\n<p>As expected, Dream\u2019s first shoot does not go in, bouncing off the rim and tugging at George\u2019s heartstrings. Dream lets out a disappointed laugh but soon picks up the next basketball to try.</p>\n<p>Five minutes on, George still finds himself huddled in his coat and jumper, watching Dream\u2019s face become increasingly more frustrated and determined as his final ball sweeps out of the net <i>again</i>. </p>\n<p>George would say he\u2019s had a least three or four rounds of attempts by this point, and has been desperately trying to insist to the other that it really doesn\u2019t matter that much and he\u2019s entirely flattered by him trying so hard. But Dream is having none of it, his competitive, patient and driven edge shining clear when he tells George to let him just have \u2018one more go\u2019 the next three times.</p>\n<p>Raising his eyebrows in question and wondering if the taller man would finally let them leave, George turns to the other man to find only a dissatisfied frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more,\u201d Dream says, voice low, resolute and steadfast. George tuts audibly and gives him a look that conveys disbelief, \u201cI promise!\u201d</p>\n<p>Relenting, George watches as his boyfriend hands over yet another ridiculous amount of money for one try at this stupid game. Doing some quick maths too, he soon realises that Dream has definitely contributed more money to playing the game to win the light-blue bear for him than it probably would\u2019ve cost for him just to buy one outright.</p>\n<p>He knows that doesn\u2019t matter to Dream though; it\u2019s the principle that counts. He\u2019s got it in his head that he\u2019s going to win something for George and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s going to do.</p>\n<p>George holds his breath as Dream lines up his first of three shots again, freezing air catching in his throat uncomfortably, and he lets out an almost shout of relief as it swooshes cleanly through the hoop, bouncing back towards them. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s laughing as he processes that they can finally leave this stall that\u2019s taken <i>waaay</i> too much of their money and who\u2019s repeated fairground music is starting to do his head in. George looks up to his side and catches Dream\u2019s beaming face and incredulous laugh, like he almost didn\u2019t believe it would finally go in too.</p>\n<p>Dream looks incredibly proud of himself, grinning ear-to-ear, and George can\u2019t help thinking about how damn cute he is. He\u2019s about to give him a \u2018congratulations\u2019 or a \u2018thank you\u2019 or something along those lines, when suddenly he feels himself being swept upwards and off of his feet.</p>\n<p>The sensation is rather alarming and he lets out a small yelp of surprise. Slowly, George eventually catches up to processing what is happening; Dream has slipped his sturdy arms around George\u2019s waist, pulled him close towards him and easily lifted him up briefly in celebration.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Oh my God</i>.\u201d He barely manages to laugh out beside the other\u2019s ear as Dream twirls them both round in an effortless circle before placing him back down.</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s cackley and wheezy laughter is beautiful as he smiles down at George, refusing to remove one of his arms from where it\u2019s now positioned around his body. George\u2019s heart beats a bit faster (if that is even possible right now), when Dream\u2019s tongue pokes out and he bites down on it in an attempt to stifle his laughs.</p>\n<p>George takes the light and fluffy teddy-bear from the stall-owner when he realises he was patiently waiting to had it to them. He accepts with a \u2018thank you\u2019 and what he knows is a horribly bright blush on his face, a consequence of several concurrent situations.</p>\n<p>They move through the crowds and into an open space near a fountain so they can hear each other talk more clearly before continuing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d win it.\u201d Dream says, smug expression donning his face with an attractive glint in his green eyes as he taps the bear in George\u2019s arms on the head.</p>\n<p>George laughs, pulling the soft animal closer to him, burying his fingers in the warm and silky pale fur as he retaliates, \u201cI don\u2019t think that counts,\u201d Dream raises his eyebrows at him challengingly, \u201cIt took you like seven tries!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, it totally counts,\u201d The taller insists defiantly. He brings one of his gentle hands up to meet George\u2019s round the bear, \u201cDo you like it, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s tone is so soft and considerate that George finds he can do nothing else but lean upwards on his tippy-toes and capture his boyfriend\u2019s lips in a kiss. </p>\n<p>When he falls flat on his feet again, George looks up into the other\u2019s eyes to find a look of amazement and sheer adoration, so strong that he has to shift his own gaze away and change the subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m kind of hungry,\u201d He starts, because he really, really is, despite his heart nearly jumping out of his chest right now, \u201cShould we grab something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s mouth quirks into a grin and George knows that he\u2019s perfectly aware that he\u2019s purposefully changing the topic, but is very grateful that he allows it anyway. </p>\n<p>\u201cI saw a churro stand up ahead, we could get some?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s mouth falls open, a little comedically, before he verbalises his disbelief, \u201cWait, churros? You\u2019ve never had a churro?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d George simply says before he realises Dream is waiting for a longer explanation, \u201cYou don\u2019t really see them all that often in the UK.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaking his head and grabbing onto George\u2019s free hand, Dream announces, \u201cWell that decides it then, we're buying them.\u201d as he directs him towards the stall. George laughs along beside him.</p>\n<p>He lets Dream order for him, securing a table for them under the canopy of thousands of white lights just outside the churro stand. Although it\u2019s still ridiculously cold, the fairy lights provide a pleasant illusion of warmth.</p>\n<p>George seats his teddy-bear next to him on the bench, it being large enough to sit on its own, and retreats his paling hands into the sleeves of his coat and hoodie as he watches Dream\u2019s tall figure wait in line.</p>\n<p>His golden hair sits like a crown upon his head and George can\u2019t ignore the tug of emotion that pulls at his heart. Dream returns before he can delve into it further, waving their food in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d The taller says as he hands the pastry over, heat immediately rushing back into his hands, \u201cThey\u2019ve got chocolate in the middle.\u201d</p>\n<p>George thanks him and only has to take one small sugary bite to let out a moan of satisfaction. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dream asks, pleased grin blooming on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God, yeah,\u201d George replies, perhaps aware of the double entendre his moans provide, \u201cThat\u2019s delicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a proud \u2018I told you so\u2019, Dream tucks into his own, neatly wiping the chocolate that marks the corner of his lips with his finger as he quickly finishes; George savours each and every bite of his.</p>\n<p>He observes the other fair-goers happily, trying to pick out the couples on first dates and those who had years of history behind them as he takes his last few bites. George finds himself glancing up at the lights of the rides nearby too as they flash a bright shade of blue, attracting his attention, and a content grin of warmth and happiness pulls onto his face.</p>\n<p>A sharp \u2018click\u2019 of a camera shutter snaps his gaze back to the man in front of him, however, as his eyes become aligned with the shiny back of Dream\u2019s phone. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat-\u201c Geroge starts, slightly dazed for a second, \u201cWait, don\u2019t-\u201c</p>\n<p>Dream is laughing his hearty, wheezy chuckle and George hits him lightly on the chest after his sole attempt to grab the phone misses.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Dreeeam</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>He whines, giving his boyfriend his best puppy eyes. It doesn\u2019t work, clearly, because Dream\u2019s laugh only strengthens and his face scrunches up, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d </p>\n<p>He tries instead, which only earns him a shake of the head and a cute little \u2018no\u2019 as the other pulls his phone closer towards his chest as he rapidly types.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you done now?\u201d</p>\n<p>George sighs after about thirty seconds of weakly tugging at the other man\u2019s sleeves to no avail.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p>\n<p>Dream tells him with a pleased smile as he places his phone back on the table again. George eyes him suspiciously, but before he can insist on knowing what he just did, he feels his phone vibrate against his thigh in his trouser pocket along with a familiar small \u2018chirp\u2019 sound.</p>\n<p>He freezes for a second. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s only one person he has Twitter notifications on for, and it\u2019s the idiot sitting in front of him.</p>\n<p>When he glances up to meet Dream\u2019s face, the other only gives him an amused grin and a very unhelpful shrug. George moves quickly to dig his phone out and slides open the tweet before even reading it.</p>\n<p>Attached is a photo of George (<i>the</i> photo, in fact, that Dream had just taken), with the short and simple caption, <i>It\u2019s my hoodie</i>.</p>\n<p>George\u2019s breath catches him his throat as he stares down at the photo and notices that you can see Dream\u2019s pale-blue hoodie easily, where it\u2019s worn under his thick winter coat. In the photo, his face also looks warm, illuminated brilliantly by the twinkling lights overhead.</p>\n<p>He can already see the replies under the post going absolutely <i>crazy</i>, flying in and updating rapidly second after second. George lets out a soft puff of air as he shakes his head, looking back up at Dream.</p>\n<p>His boyfriend\u2019s got this silly, lopsided grin on his face, and George quickly makes up his mind about his next move. </p>\n<p>Bringing his phone quickly back up to hold in both hands, he types out a reply under Dream\u2019s tweet.</p>\n<p><i>You\u2019re an idiot</i>.</p>\n<p>He can see Dream snicker when he sees it come up on his own phone and George waits impatiently as the man\u2019s fingers begin moving again. </p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s reply reads, <i>YOUR idiot &lt;3</i>, to which George emits an even more pronounced shake of his head until he leans over the bench table to pull him into a kiss again.</p>\n<p>He can feel Dream\u2019s broad smile against his increasingly warm lips and he almost breaks apart to voice the emotion pulling tenderly at his heartstrings, but then Dream\u2019s large hand cups his cheek and all memory flows out of his brain.</p>\n<p>(#DreamsHoodie hits the top of the Twitter trending page in less than ten minutes.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one.\u201d </p>\n<p>Dream explains as they weave their way through the currents of people flooding the louder side of the park that\u2019s filled to the brim with rides and rollercoasters, as they had decided to resume their night. Dream had waved the two tokens George had long forgotten about at him and led him away eagerly with an anticipatory smirk at the other\u2019s confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one?\u201d George repeats, staring upwards at the tall and brightly lit Ferris wheel that stands front and centre at Winter Wonderland, \u201c...what about the height?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream glances over to him questioningly, George blushes as he continues. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>His boyfriend gives him a sweet smile before grabbing his hand again and explaining that he\u2019d read about the height of the wheel beforehand and that it \u2018should be fine\u2019. </p>\n<p>George tells him that doesn\u2019t sound amazingly encouraging, but thinks about how of course Dream has it all <i>calculated</i> before they even arrived. Perfect to a T.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dream starts again with a hopeful smile, \u201cDo you want to go on?\u201d</p>\n<p>George agrees with a firm nod and a squeeze of his hand before they move to join the line. It\u2019s nearing the closing time for the park now, they\u2019ve been here already for a good two hours, mucking about on game stalls and the like in between, so the queue isn\u2019t too long a wait.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t help but find it cute as Dream\u2019s hand slips around his waist and clutches on firmly when they take their seat in the Ferris wheel car. His tight grip maintains as the motion of the ride brings them up to the top backwards at first, halting when they reach the very peak. </p>\n<p>George allows himself to giggle a little before he whispers reassuring words to Dream, distracting him with playful taps of his feet and pushing their thighs close together.</p>\n<p>He studies his boyfriend\u2019s handsome and flushed face, no doubt unreasonably embarrassed at his fear. George follows his sharply cut jawline up to his rosy cheeks and soft, yet bright eyes. Dream\u2019s dirty-blond hair ruffles soundlessly in the wind that catches around them.</p>\n<p>George feels wholeheartedly content as he lets his gaze drift over the city. From this height he can see the busy streets bustling below him, usually deafeningly loud but now seeming like a silent film. He focuses on the blinking lights of business blocks in the distance and likens them to the clear and moon-lit sky above, endlessly far and stretching away.</p>\n<p>Euphoria and serenity rush through his body and his mind is quickly made up.</p>\n<p>\u201cDream,\u201d He says softly, a spoken whisper caught on the wind that the other manages to hear all the same, glittering eyes turning to George with full attention, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His heart pounds against his chest, bursting smilingly as he watches Dream\u2019s expression light up beautifully and brilliantly at the words he\u2019d always desired to hear. Only this time the context adds another heavy and profound layer of meaning.</p>\n<p>He feels himself pulled impossibly closer against Dream\u2019s warm body as the taller leans his forehead slowly towards him until it rests gently against George\u2019s. His eyelids flutter closed as he tries to ingrain this moment into his mind forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Dream takes a short breath before he continues, taking his time as he speaks his words thoroughly and sincerely, \u201c<i>So</i>, so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their warm breath intermingles in the air, hands weaving together under the safety bar and gripping on tightly, as if not to ever let the other go.</p>\n<p>And they never will.</p>"
