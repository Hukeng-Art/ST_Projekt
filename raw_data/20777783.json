  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>\n<span>We'll meet again. Don't know where. Don't know when. But I know we'll meet again some sunny day ~ We\u2019ll Meet Again</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Vera Lynn</span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">It\u2019s no surprise that Ba Sing Se, a jewel of the desert and the largest city in the world, was the source of inspiration for many pieces of art. A popular ballad written in the early years of the Hundred Year War once professed that though the fighting separated them, the singer would reunite with their love in Ba Sing Se. Because of this, the city earned the moniker \u2018the City of Reunions\u2019. And as another dawn rose above the tiered walls, a very special reunion was about to occur.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey losers, wake up, this is important,\u201d Toph announced to her sleeping companions from their comfy home in Ba Sing Se\u2019s Upper Ring. She frowned, tapping her feet in annoyance; she\u2019d even tried to be</span>\n<em>\n<span> polite</span>\n</em>\n<span>. But instead, the Avatar and the Water Tribe siblings simply ignored her message and continued to sleep. Now a familiar emotion, aggravation and rowdiness, stole across her face as she stomped violently on the ground causing the earth beneath them to swell and throw the peacefully sleeping children in the air until they landed in a muddled heap one on top of another. Their complaints were cut off with another threatening stomp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh good you\u2019re awake,\u201d Toph said with false cheer. \u201cWe have a visitor asking for our help, now come on,\u201d she turned her back to them but paused. \u201cSokka, I can feel you squirming deeper into your bedding. If I have to be up then so do all of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho comes visiting at...\u201d Sokka moaned, squinting out the window as he got himself ready, \u201cthis early? The sun\u2019s barely up yet. I shouldn\u2019t have to get up this early unless some crazy Firebender is chasing us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs the Avatar, it\u2019s my duty to help those in need, no matter the time,\u201d Aang said solemnly but the impact was lessened by the large yawn in the middle as he wearily rubbed at one eye. Katara didn\u2019t say anything, surprisingly awake as she fiddled with the cap of her waterskin, already on edge from the early morning visit. Toph didn\u2019t seem overly worried but then few things did phase the blind girl. Perhaps that\u2019s why Katara was the first to react when they entered the kitchen and found a familiar face gently coaxing the stove fire as the kettle began to whistle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou,\u201d Katara sneered, instantly stepping in front of her family and lashing out with her water whip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKatara wait,\u201d Toph frowned, putting up a wall between them to stop the water before lowering it back into the dirt. \u201cHe gave me tea and advice when I needed it and I always pay back my debts. He told me you guys had some bad history but he promised to behave or else I\u2019ll catapult him beyond the Outer Wall.\u201d The latter statement was said with her head swiveled in the firebender\u2019s direction, who nodded in acquiescence as he laid out several cups and began pouring the freshly brewed tea. His hands held the handle of the teapot in a white knuckled grip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd he did try to help us at the North Pole,\u201d Aang interjected, \u201cI\u2019m willing to listen at least.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour generosity is appreciated,\u201d Iroh said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you children can understand that I would not be here if I were not desperate.\u201d Coming out of his stuttering stupor, Sokka stalked forward and slammed his hands on the table causing some of the tea to jostle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re Fire Nation!\u201d He shrieked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is corre</span>\n<span>ct,\u201d the man said, pausing to give a smile as he handed the Avatar some tea. Aang went to take a sip before Katara waterbended it out of the cup and out the open window. She glared at him for accepting a drink from the enemy while Aang just looked saddened at his empty cup.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re Zuko\u2019s crazy grandfather!\u201d Sokka continued as if still trying to wrap his head around who was standing in his kitchen trying again to pour tea into Aang\u2019s cup only for Katara to pluck it out of her friend\u2019s hands and toss that out the window as well.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUncle,\u201d he corrected but he seemed distressed at the mention of his nephew\u2019s name. Understanding that no one else would be having tea, he poured his own cup and sat down, his thumb nervously rubbing along the smooth porcelain edges of the steaming cup. \u201cPlease, I mean you no harm, I am not here as a Prince of the Fire Nation or a highly decorated General,\u201d his eyes flickered for just a moment, hinting at what he could do \u2014 if so inclined, \u201cI am here merely as Zuko\u2019s uncle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, where is Zuko?\u201d Aang asked, reaching over to try and take some of Toph\u2019s tea but she earthbended his chair until he was just out of range. The others looked around, as if noticing for the first time the Zuko sized hole in the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is why I am here,\u201d Iroh said with a concerned frown. \u201cZuko didn\u2019t come home last night and I\u2019m worried about what's happened to him. I humbly beg for your help in finding him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>XxX</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI cannot believe we are doing this,\u201d Sokka grumbled, his shoulders hunched and his arms crossed angrily across his chest as he stalked behind the seemingly harmless but surprisingly frightening Fire Nation General (</span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we ever had a proper introduction, I am called Iroh,\u201d the man had said as he did some stupid, evil Fire Nation bow, \u201cbut in this city I am simply Mushi.\u201d \u201cNo, your name is Uncle,\u201d Toph said slowly, as if it were inconceivable for him to be called anything else).\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe seems to be genuine,\u201d Aang had countered with a little shrug. \u201cI mean he looks pretty upset, you can\u2019t fake that kind of emotion.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAang, everyone knows that Firebenders don\u2019t have real emotions,\u201d Sokka explained patiently as one would a small child. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life, like the sky is blue or the Earth is flat.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFun fact, the sky isn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>really</span>\n</em>\n<span> blue, it\u2019s actually colorless but the sun\u2019s light makes it reflect blue,\u201d Aang chirped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd the Earth definitely isn\u2019t flat,\u201d Toph said with a raised eyebrow, \u201cand Uncle is telling the truth; he and his nephew are on the run from the Fire Nation, they came to the city as refugees, Zuko went out last night and never came home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease don\u2019t call him Uncle,\u201d Sokka wrinkled his nose before rolling his eyes. \u201cAnd, come on, are you saying your bending magic can tell if people are lying?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah actually,\u201d Toph growled threateningly and Sokka wisely scooted over so Aang was between them. \u201cPeople react when they lie, their heart rate and breathing changes and I can feel all those interactions through the ground.\u201d She became sadly contemplative, \u201cthe last time I saw Uncle; he was steady, warm and patient. His vitals are all over the place now and he can\u2019t stop fidgeting. He\u2019s really worried for this Zuko guy.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy nephew has always been reckless but his unfortunate circumstances over the last few months have only made it worse,\u201d Iroh said, no longer pretending like he hadn\u2019t been listening. \u201cHe is a complicated young man but he is considerate to a fault. He knows better than to make me worry, in this city of all places.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in how </span>\n<em>\n<span>considerate</span>\n</em>\n<span> Zuko is,\u201d Katara frowned. \u201cWe\u2019re allowing you to come while we look for Appa but when we find Zuko, we\u2019re going to ensure that you don\u2019t cause any harm even if we have to chase you out of the city ourselves.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKatara, we said we\u2019d help,\u201d Aang said but his teacher just gave him a look. \u201cCan\u2019t we all just get along? Like Uncle said, they\u2019re not here to hurt anyone; they just wanted a place to start over.\u201d Aang bit his lip and thought of a blue theater mask, tattooed archers and frozen frogs. \u201cToph said you need to pay your debts and I, I\u2019m honor bound to return the help that was given to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko has changed since you last saw him but I understand that we have different goals. Familial loyalty is not restrained to your tribes, young Waterbender. If we need to flee the protection of this city in exchange for my nephew\u2019s safe return then I will do so in a heartbeat. All I want is my boy returned to me, no cost is too high.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Sokka interrupted, still sulking near the back. \u201cI only agreed to this because the sheer irony of tracking down the guy who chased us all over the spirit blasted world is too good to pass up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>XxX</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey so I added a little bit on Zuko to our Appa posters,\u201d Sokka grinned, ink staining his hands and face as he proudly showed off the new addition. Katara immediately burst into hysterical laughter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSokka, Zuko\u2019s hair couldn\u2019t have grown </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> much since we last saw him,\u201d Aang corrected doing his best not to laugh at the drawing\u2019s long, luscious locks. \u201cAlso the scar is on the wrong side.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is not,\u201d Sokka stomped as he clutched the posters to his chest. Zuko\u2019s face was the center of his worst nightmares, the Fire Nation invading his village and threatening his people. There was no way he\u2019d forgotten something as crucial as which side his scar was on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is,\u201d Iroh sighed, looking like he wanted to be amused by the antics but was too worried to do so. \u201cAlso my nephew is much more handsome than that, couldn\u2019t you have drawn him smiling?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Zuko smile,\u201d Aang noted thoughtfully.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko\u2019s smiles are like the sun on a cloudy day, mysterious and fleeting but each glimpse is nothing short of a blessing,\u201d Iroh added, almost thoughtlessly as he looked around the crowded market place.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d Sokka sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust because something is rare does make it any less beautiful,\u201d Aang translated as Iroh nodded. Sokka\u2019s eye twitched, oh great, another person who only communicated in proverbs. No wonder Zuko ran off. He wisely did not mention as much to the twitchy Firebender who was still glancing around the area for his nephew. It was uncomfortable seeing the enemy look so human.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t feel him here in the Upper Ring, maybe we should check back at the tea shop you guys work at,\u201d Toph suggested before frowning. \u201cWait a minute, you guys live in the Lower Ring, so how\u2019d you get into the Upper Ring without being spotted?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAn old man is entitled to a few secrets,\u201d The man chuckled before his cheer dissolved into a sigh. \u201cAs for your suggestion, I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s there. Zuko gets easily lost on the ground; he prefers to travel by rooftop so I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to find him. I waited at the shop until past the start of our shift, he doesn\u2019t like the job but he wouldn\u2019t miss it unless he was forced to. I know my nephew better than he knows himself; he\u2019s not there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen we\u2019ll just have to keep looking, even if it takes the rest of the day,\u201d Aang announced, puffing out his chest with determination, ignoring the groans of his companions behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>XxX</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh Zuko loves animals, always has, ever since he was a boy,\u201d Iroh said with a genial but strained smile. No one commented on the way his eyes darted over the crowd with increasing anxiety or how he kept clenching and unclenching his hands or when he\u2019d started telling funny little stories as if that would fight back the mounting dread. They\u2019d all been there, felt that fear and worry for a loved one. Sokka had long since given up his proclamations that it was all a trap when the man\u2019s distress was so obvious. When, not if, </span>\n<em>\n<span>when</span>\n</em>\n<span> they found Zuko; they were going to wallop him for making his uncle worry so much.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn fact, and don\u2019t tell him I said this, he\u2019s quite enamored with your bison, young Avatar. He\u2019s never said as much but I know if circumstances were different, he would love nothing more than to bury his hands in all that fur. You should have seen the way he doted on the ostrich-horse we had before we came to the city; I swear he fed that animal more than he did himself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAppa used to love visiting the Fire Nation,\u201d Aang said sadly, \u201cMy friend Kuzon would get his hands super warm and rub between Appa\u2019s toes. He knew all the sweet spots to get Appa\u2019s tail thumping, one time he was flapping so hard the wind knocked over a tree,\u201d Aang chuckled but it was thin and despondent. \u201cI miss him,\u201d the last Airbender whispered, not specifying if he meant his dead Fire Nation friend or his missing Sky Bison. Perhaps even he was grieving the loss of the world he had once known which had been lost by the ancestors of the man beside him. Iroh laid a gentle hand across the young boy\u2019s shoulders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThose we have lost are not gone, so long as we keep their love and memory alive, their spirits will always burn within us. We may grieve them but not lose sight of our way forward, not lose hope for a reunion with the loved ones still in this world,\u201d Iroh added softly with grim understanding. Aang nodded, fighting back the tears and doing his best to channel his sorrow into finding Appa, and Zuko now too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen we find them, I\u2019ll be sure to let Zuko pet Appa. I know he\u2019s missed fire warmed hands petting him down,\u201d Aang added, happy no one mentioned his cracking voice. Iroh withdrew his hand and tucked them into his sleeves where they were being wrung nervously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe pond in the palace garden was always filled with turtleducks and Zuko adored those creatures. No matter how many times his mother told him that turtleducks belonged outside, that boy was always bringing them in. Some days we couldn\u2019t go an hour without hearing a quiet little quacking coming from underneath his shirt. Eventually they became so used to being handled that Zuko could sneak them all the way to his room without us knowing. At least a few times to my knowledge, he would be found in the mornings surrounded by a little nest.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The group laughed at that, trying to imagine a prickly, screaming teenage Zuko curled protectively around a bunch of sleeping turtleducks. This morning, the image would have been impossible but Iroh\u2019s loving perspective and endless wealth of stories had made the idea a little more plausible. Zuko may have been a jerk and trying to turn them over to the Fire Lord, but he was also a talented tsungi horn player and had stuttered as a child and had a horrible sense of direction and an animal lover. Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation was none of these things but Iroh\u2019s nephew apparently was and that was the person they were searching for, the one they were hoping to meet.</span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>XxX</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko!\u201d Sokka shouted loudly through the market, \u201cCome out, come out, wherever you are! Come on, man, you\u2019re upsetting your uncle!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Toph hissed, punching him in the arm. \u201cHe goes by Lee here, are you trying to get them locked up by the Dai Li?\u201d Sokka\u2019s face twisted in momentary contemplation, it </span>\n<em>\n<span>would</span>\n</em>\n<span> probably be for the best to turn in the two Fire Princes but\u2026 they\u2019d apparently been here for a while without doing anything evil so that was probably too harsh. Huh, the Dai Li successfully out jerked the Jerkbenders. Evil really was escalating these days.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, he just doesn\u2019t really strike me as a </span>\n<em>\n<span>Lee</span>\n</em>\n<span>, y\u2019know?\u201d Sokka shrugged.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe still struggles with it,\u201d Uncle said with a smile. \u201cWhen he first picked the alias, he was always calling himself Zu-Lee, an admittedly beautiful name for a young lady. He\u2019s gotten better since we arrived in the city but he still slips sometimes,\u201d a fond shake of the head. \u201cFor a boy who loves the theatre so much his acting skills leave much to be desired, that is,\u201d he said with a sly little glance at Aang, \u201cunless the situation is especially dire, then he gets rather </span>\n<em>\n<span>Spirited</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aang, pointedly ignored the questioning look his friends were giving him. There had been more than enough revelations surrounding Zuko today for him to drag that mess with Zhao into it. Like a good Airbender, Aang diverted. \u201cZuko seems to have lots of hobbies: theatre, animals, bending,\u201d he bit his lip, \u201cswords.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, what, swords? Since when? I\u2019ve only ever seen him, you know,\u201d he looked around at the crowd before miming some Firebending complete with small explosion noises. Katara raised an eyebrow at her brother.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDespite how clear a river may appear, it can still hold many unseen depths,\u201d Iroh smiled. For just a moment, he seemed almost relaxed, clearly in his element speaking confusing proverbs to children. Then he seemed to come back to himself, to remember it was not his long-suffering nephew he was addressing but his enemies.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Sokka rolled his eyes. \u201cAs much as I love discussing, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Zuko\u2019s hobbies</span>\n</em>\n<span>, let\u2019s talk about the Fire Nation; specifically strategic weaknesses and firebending counters. I would be amenable to hearing about some secret tunnels, possibly one that leads straight to the Fire Lord\u2019s bedroom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Iroh shrugged, always agreeable to a little bit of treason when his nephew wasn\u2019t looking. And besides, these nice kids were being so kind in helping him search for Zuko. \u201cLet\u2019s see, the palace is pretty heavily fortified though talented benders like yourself could make quick work of the building and guards. There is a network of tunnels running underneath the Capital City but most of them have been blocked off after an attempt on Fire Lord Azulon\u2019s life.\u201d He stroked his beard in contemplation before snapping his fingers. \u201cOh you might be interested in this; a total solar eclipse which will cover the Fire Nation is coming up just after the summer solstice. Firebenders are reliant on Agni\u2019s power to bend so, for about ten minutes, they will be vulnerable.\u201d He thought the children would be delighted by that revelation but instead they all looked as if he\u2019d slapped them with a dead fish.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Sokka squeaked, \u201cTell me, does uh </span>\n<em>\n<span>everyone</span>\n</em>\n<span> in the Fire Nation know about this eclipse?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did mention our power is dependent on the sun, therefore we devote a lot of time and energy into being able to predict when and where eclipses will occur. The whole city will likely be under heavy guard but many, including my brother and niece, rely too heavily on firebending. They mocked Zuko for studying the blade but my nephew would never let something like a loss of his bending stop him from fighting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you think, hypothetically of course, if we were to amass an army from the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes we could, theoretically, invade the Fire Nation on uhhh let\u2019s call it the Day of Black Sun and fight the Fire Lord?\u201d Sokka grinned while his friend\u2019s smacked their forehead with their palms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe defending side always has the advantage in a siege but with a skilled enough group and a solid plan I would favor your odds,\u201d the General smiled. \u201cAh if I were ten years younger and not trying to rehabilitate a troubled young man, I would love to join you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut why? This is your people you\u2019d be fighting and you\u2019re royalty, the Fire Lord is your-\u201d Katara cut herself off, aware of the ears around them but also unable to put the words together. She couldn\u2019t imagine going after her own brother that way but she supposes she might, if he was as big a jerk as the Fire Lord seemed to be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy young lady,\u201d Iroh said in a soft but absolutely menacing voice. \u201cIf at any point in my life I am within sight of my brother I will take great care to </span>\n<em>\n<span>sear him down to his bones</span>\n</em>\n<span>. It will pain me certainly but some things cannot be forgiven.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut killing is wrong, even the Fire Lord,\u201d Aang said resolutely after a minute of stunned silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAll life is sacred, that is the creed of the Air Nomads and it is a beautiful sentiment I do my best to uphold,\u201d Iroh acknowledged. \u201cBut I stayed my hand too many times, watching him hurt his son in every way imaginable and twist his daughter into someone scarcely human.\u201d He gently patted Aang\u2019s small shoulder. \u201cThere is great honor in seeking to avoid death, if you decide you cannot end the Fire Lord\u2019s life then I will be happy to act in your steed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks we\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Sokka said in a frantic, high pitched voice from the sheer power and danger radiating off the man.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJeez, I know the Fire Lord is bad and all but what\u2019d he do to make you so mad?\u201d Toph questioned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe knows what he did,\u201d Iroh said with such venom that they were all taking a step back. Worse yet, was the slight almost flippant gesture to his left eye, to the eye where Zuko had been horribly burned. Suddenly stopping the Fire Lord seemed so much more important than it had five minutes prior.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat, we\u2019ll just take your contact information and send you a messenger hawk when we need you. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be sure to feed and water Zuko while you\u2019re gone,\u201d Sokka quipped.</span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>XxX</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, Mushi,\u201d the shopkeeper Shiran said with sympathetic eyes, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen young Lee around since you last asked. I\u2019ve passed around that you\u2019re looking for him and the moment he\u2019s spotted, we\u2019ll have someone let you know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, thank you, I appreciate it,\u201d Iroh mumbled feeling more stressed and anxious than he could ever recall being in his entire life. Well that\u2019s not true, he\u2019d felt this way on the warzone that once existed outside these walls and forever in his memory. That stomach dropping, hand shaking realization when only half of Lu Ten\u2019s division had returned to camp, most injured and weeping and he couldn\u2019t find his boy\u2019s face among the crowd and he\u2019d been forced to reckon with the too terrible to contemplate reality that- No. This was not a battle and Zuko was not Lu Ten. He would turn up, he would accept his Uncle\u2019s chastising and let him hug him longer than he normally did and everything would go back to normal. He had to believe it, it was the only thing keeping him standing.</span>\n<span> \u201cPlease let me know if you hear anything else,\u201d he said, turning to leave.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Shiran said hesitantly as he looked around to ensure they were alone, \u201cthere might be something. I don\u2019t want to get you worked up without cause but with your boy still missing, you probably should know\u2026\u201d For the second time in his life, Iroh could feel as if he were on the end of the world about to tumble over the edge into nothingness.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Outside, the rest of the group was anxiously searching the dirty alleys and dusty streets of the Lower Ring. Toph\u2019s feet were almost buried in the dirt, her tongue stuck out in concentration as she tried to expand her senses. Sokka was handing out as many posters as he could while Aang and Katara clarified about the inaccurate illustration. They\u2019d started out the search as unwilling tag-a-longs but now were looking in earnest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUncle said Zuko had gotten in a fight with another boy a few days ago who\u2019d accused them of being Firebenders. Maybe someone overheard and decided to do something about it. Zuko could be locked up, unable to escape, maybe even being tortured.\u201d Katara said anxiously, her fingers rubbing across her mother\u2019s pendant; the thought that the boy she worried after had once held it hostage far out of her mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s many things but he\u2019s not stupid,\u201d Sokka interrupted. \u201cHe\u2019s in the heart of Earth Kingdom, if anyone found out he was Firebender, much less the Fire Lord\u2019s son, he\u2019d be up an ice flow without a paddle. Uncle mentioned he hangs out on the rooftops to brood; he probably decided to skip work so he could practice his pouting.\u201d He continued doubtfully, not convinced of his own theory.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t, he\u2019s got to know Uncle\u2019s going out of his mind with worry,\u201d Toph said softly. Sokka opened his mouth to counter that they </span>\n<em>\n<span>didn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> actually know what Zuko was thinking but shut it again. Iroh\u2019s, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Uncle\u2019s</span>\n</em>\n<span>, stories had gotten to them; the picture he\u2019d painted was of a very troubled but loyal nephew. They understood that Zuko would no more want to upset his uncle than Katara would learn to fly. Spirits what a day this was turning into, he didn\u2019t want to </span>\n<em>\n<span>feel </span>\n</em>\n<span>like this for the enemy. Toph frowned and twisted her foot, \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming towards us, a teenager, light on his feet but walking confidently.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katara stood on her toes and caught a glimpse of shaggy dark brown hair like how Iroh said it had grown out. \u201cThere!\u201d She said before frowning. She didn\u2019t remember Zuko being that tall and the walk was all off. She didn\u2019t get a chance to correct herself before Aang had launched himself into the air towards the teen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko, we\u2019ve been so worried!\u201d the Airbender enthused, wrapping his arms around the figure and burying his face in the boy\u2019s chest. \u201cYour Uncle has been looking all over for you and we\u2019re so glad you\u2019re not-,\u201d he looked up and gasped, jumping back away from Not-Zuko. \u201cJet?\u201d He yelped as the others plus Uncle rushed over to where they congregated, the crowds going around them like a river.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re surprised to see me but I promise, I\u2019m here to help you find your bison,\u201d Jet said with a smooth smile. In his hand, he had one of Appa\u2019s posters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know where Appa is?\u201d Aang asked with a hopeful gasp before he noticed that Uncle had crept up beside him. He had to do a double take; the Firebender was white as a spirit and had a look of barely controlled devastation on his face. The man looked at Jet like he was the answer to his worst nightmare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is the young man who attacked my nephew and I in our shop,\u201d Uncle whispered. \u201cHe accused us of being Firebenders and fought my nephew until the Dai Li arrested him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Dai Li!\u201d Katara gasped before furrowing into a snarl as she pulled some water from a nearby fountain, pushing him roughly against an alley wall as she locked his wrists over his head with ice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey old man, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019ve never seen you before and I sure don\u2019t know about the Dai Li or your nephew,\u201d Jet said holding up his hands in surrender as best he could.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Katara shouted, forming several icy spikes and bringing them closer to his face. \u201cWhy should we trust </span>\n<em>\n<span>anything </span>\n</em>\n<span>you have to say? You\u2019d do anything to hurt the Fire Nation. Did you think working with the Dai Li would help?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI swear, I've changed! I was a troubled person and I let my anger get out of control, but I don't even have the gang now! I've put all that behind me!\u201d Jet exclaimed, looking between all of them but lingering on Iroh. \u201cI promise I\u2019ve never seen you before in my life.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s lying,\u201d Toph frowned, putting her hand up against the wall. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s the same guy?\u201d Their interrogation was interrupted by an arrow embedding in the wall beside them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They turned and saw Smellerbee and Longshot, who had notched another arrow into his bow as a silent but obvious threat, coming towards them. Smellerbee looked so furious; she might start spitting sparks herself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJet, what is wrong with you?\u201d She screeched. \u201cYou got taken by the Dai Li because you couldn\u2019t leave these people alone! I don\u2019t care if they really are Firebenders or if you\u2019re just repressing your crush on the scarred kid but I am sick and tired of your obsessiveness ruining our shot at a new life!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you guys doing in the city?\u201d Jet gaped, \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t kidnapped by anyone, I don\u2019t know anything about the Dai Li or Firebenders.\u201d He added with a slightly manic look as everyone stared at him, \u201cGet away from me, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJoo Dee,\u201d Sokka breathed out as a horrible, horrible scenario came to mind. Jet had been taken in by the Dai Li after calling Zuko and Iroh Firebenders. The Dai Li were serious about keeping the war outside of the city. The Dai Li apparently had something that could make you forget key memories. Zuko had gone out last night and not come home. What if Zuko was wandering around the city, his mind wiped blank of his uncle and their whole life? Or maybe the shadowy protectors of Ba Sing Se would come up with a more permanent solution if they found a Fire Nation royal within their walls. \u201cOh man guys this is bad, this is really bad,\u201d he said as he laid out his terrible theory.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was just informed that another young man was taken last night, no one knows who he was b-but he about the right age and apparently fought viciously before he was eventually subdued,\u201d Iroh said softly, his voice catching in the middle. \u201cWhy are you here? Did they let you go because you gave them a more appealing target?\u201d His fists were trembling at his sides, from fear or anger or both. He looked so lost, his amber eyes searching Jet\u2019s eyes as if he could find Zuko\u2019s fate written in them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUncle, we don\u2019t know what happened but I promise we won\u2019t stop until we find out,\u201d Aang said, laying a gentle hand on his arm. He didn\u2019t know Uncle all that well but he did know Zuko and he wanted to prevent this situation from getting any more violent than it already was. Aang was ready for the Firebender to lunge so he was taken by surprise when the man became dead weight and to sunk to his knees as if all the strength had suddenly left his body.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko,\u201d he whined under his breath, \u201cmy boy, my boy, my precious boy. You can\u2019t be gone. I can\u2019t go through that again, not in this accursed city; I cannot lose another son to Ba Sing Se.\u201d Iroh breathed out unevenly, his shoulders shaking as he did nothing to repress his painful, aching sobs. It was a sound so far removed from the terrifying General who\u2019d beaten back a score of Firebenders at the North Pole; a sound so terrible it pulled tears from the eyes of those who had been his enemies not a day ago.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katara held him in a half hug, muttering empty assurances under her breath not knowing if they were true or not. Sokka keep a steady hand on his shoulders, slightly apart but still offering support. Aang was looking at the group with wide, wet eyes, sympathetic to the man\u2019s grief and secretly fearful that he soon will be grieving for Appa. Toph, not good with such heavy emotions, turns to the group that have</span>\n<em>\n<span> dared</span>\n</em>\n<span> to hurt her Uncle and friends. She encased the three of them in stone up to their necks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you have anything to say about what happened to Lee?\u201d She demanded in a low, tight voice. Thankful for the bangs covering her eyes so they couldn\u2019t see how upset she was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cN-N-No, the last I saw, he-he was at the tea shop with the old man. Believe me, we want nothing to do with them,\u201d Smellerbee defended. Long Shot nodded in confirmation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have no idea who you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jet said simply, \u201cbut if I had anything to do with his disappearance then I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Toph snarled and released the earth binding them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d she said with a brusque wave of her hand. \u201cYou better pray to the spirits none of us catch you again. Take this chance and turn your life around or I\u2019ll make you regret it.\u201d Smellerbee grabbed ahold of Jet\u2019s hand and hurriedly pulled him away, disappearing into the crowd followed by Long Shot. Jet was pulled behind, looking like there was more he wanted to say before he too was engulfed. It occurred to her that they never did find out what Jet knew about Appa but, who cares, they didn\u2019t need anyone who made Uncle cry. They\u2019d find Appa </span>\n<em>\n<span>and </span>\n</em>\n<span>Zuko all on their own.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cH-hey,\u201d Aang sniffed in a wobbly voice. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves; Z-Zuko is probably just fine. We can\u2019t search while we\u2019re all worked up, let\u2019s take a tea break and keep searching.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTea sounds good,\u201d Sokka nodded as he pulled his sister to her feet. \u201cThat is, if Katara will let us have any this time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I think we all could do with some tea,\u201d Katara mumbled, wiping at her eyes. She held out her hand for Iroh to take. \u201cCome on Uncle, you promised you would show us your shop; everyone we talked to said it was the best around.\u201d But the old man did not move, his tears were silent now but he could not bring himself to move. There was nowhere to go if Zuko really was gone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUncle,\u201d Toph whined, flopping to the ground and resting her head against his shoulder. \u201cWe won\u2019t find him if we just sit here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToph\u2019s right; after Appa was taken, I almost lost myself to my despair. But Katara told me to have hope, hope to be reunited with my friend and hope that we will be able to end this war. Sometimes that\u2019s all we have, the belief that tomorrow will bring a brighter day.\u201d Aang said, tightening his grip on his staff.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy own words turned against me,\u201d Iroh said softly as he accepted Katara\u2019s hand and let her help him to his feet. He looked terrible, his eyes red and his face an unhealthy mix of pale and flushed with his warm amber eyes looking dim and so very lost. But he was standing because if there was even a glimmer of hope that his nephew still breathed than he would walk to the other ends of the earth to find him. \u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check the shop one more time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, Zuko\u2019s probably there waiting for you to return, just as worried for you as you are him,\u201d Katara babbled, ignoring Sokka\u2019s panicked shaking of his head. The old man was already fragile right now; there was no reason to get his hopes up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Iroh sighed, not putting much hope in the theory but appreciating the comfort nonetheless. These were good children, had the war not been between them, he knew Zuko would get along with them. Iroh had suspected ever since that fated, impossible meeting at the South Pole that some force had been driving Zuko into the Avatar\u2019s orbit; that is was his destiny to be the boy\u2019s Firebending teacher and repair the wrongs of Sozin\u2019s line. But right now, he didn\u2019t care about destiny. He\u2019d trade all the tea in the world just to see his boy, hold him close and tell him how loved he was. Iroh closed his eyes as his feet shuffled and led them closer to the shop. Why, he can almost hear Zuko\u2019s sweet voice now\u2026 He paused for a moment and opened his eyes before he broke out into a sprint leaving his young companions behind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Iroh kicked open the door to the shop, so hard that it whacked loudly against the back wall. Everyone turned to look at him but he only had eyes for one person.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUncle,\u201d Zuko said, looking stressed and angry and relieved all at once, setting the serving trays he was balancing down so he could put his hands on his hips. \u201cWhere have you been? I was starting to get wor-\u201d there wasn\u2019t much to say after that because Iroh had engulfed him in his arms, hugging him so tightly he could barely breathe. He planted little desperate kisses in the boy\u2019s hairline and face, too caught up in his own relief to care about his usual distance or propriety.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cZuko, Zuko, Zuko,\u201d Uncle chanted breathlessly, rocking him back and forth before pulling back, gripping the sides of his face with trembling reverence, like he was holding onto something more precious than gold. Zuko grabbed ahold of his robes in concern. Uncle had been crying, that was plain to see. He looked, well, he looked how he had after he had returned home from the battlefield with a jar full of Lu Ten\u2019s ashes. Uncle leaned forward until their foreheads were touching. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do that to me again, young man. Don\u2019t you</span>\n<em>\n<span> ever</span>\n</em>\n<span> give me reason to think you are gone. You are my love and my light, never forget that nephew.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko should be embarrassed to be the center of such an emotional, public display. He should be furious his uncle had disappeared to spirits knows where leaving him to manage the shop alone. He should be so many things but instead he felt reassured to see his only true family member safe and returned back to him. He lowered his guard, just for a moment, and let his eyes slide shut as he focused on the feel of warmth and safety his uncle always provided. The moment was broken by several sets of arms wrapping around the two of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re okay! We were so worried!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou stupid idiot, where did you go? We\u2019ve covered half this stupid city looking for you!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe thought you\u2019d been killed! Or brainwashed! Or locked up in some dungeon! Or all three at once!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere in the spirit\u2019s name were you! Do you know what you put your Uncle through!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko\u2019s brief moment of comfort and happiness burst into flames, as it usually did, when he realized he was surrounded on all sides by the Avatar and his annoying entourage. He\u2019d known they were in the city because of their bison posters but that was a whole different story compared to seeing the lot of them in their tea shop, </span>\n<em>\n<span>hugging him</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Only the heavy eyes of the entire shop on them kept the group from bursting into flames.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUncle,\u201d he hissed testily, \u201cwhat are </span>\n<em>\n<span>They</span>\n</em>\n<span> doing here?\u201d Uncle began carding his fingers through his hair and, hmm, okay that felt nice as he relaxed into the man\u2019s touch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome, let\u2019s go to the back, I\u2019ll put on some tea,\u201d Iroh said, gently shooing the children off while gently pushing his nephew along, refusing to let go for even a moment. Such a dramatic reunion would keep the customer\u2019s gossiping long enough for a quick cup.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Uncle</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Zuko questioned again once they were tucked back in the small, crowded kitchen. \u201cWhy is the Avatar here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come back to the apartment after your little \u2018walk\u2019\u201d, Iroh stated. Now that Zuko was safe there going to be hell to pay for making him worry so. \u201cWhat was I supposed to think? I thought you\u2019d been kidnapped or injured or what other sort of spirit blasted nonsense you always find yourself in.\u201d Deep breath in, but quell the flames so he won\u2019t fear being burned. \u201cYou know what city we\u2019re in, Nephew, you know what date just passed; you cannot expect me to sit calmly on my hands when you don\u2019t return home.\u201d Zuko winced, ducking a bit into the collar of his tunic with shame. He felt like the biggest jerk around except he couldn\u2019t know that most of Team Avatar thought he looked a bit like a shy turtle-duck standing there. Zuko wasn\u2019t supposed to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>adorable</span>\n</em>\n<span> and yet here they were.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that all means but where </span>\n<em>\n<span>were</span>\n</em>\n<span> you, Sparky?\u201d Toph demanded, poking Zuko forcefully in the chest. \u201cSo spill, were you lighting fires? Starting fights? Kissing girls?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko flushed, with rage, embarrassment, possibly both. He looked over at his uncle with pleading eyes as he bowed deeply. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I worried you Uncle Iroh, it won\u2019t happen again. But now that you\u2019ve found me, the Avatar and his friends can leave us, preferably the city. Forever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh no,\u201d Katara said, stepping forward into Zuko\u2019s personal space. This boy used to terrify her but now he was no scarier than her brother or Aang, just another dumb kid caught up in this terrible war. \u201cI did not cover half this city and have my heart torn out listening to your uncle\u2019s anguished worries just to be dismissed by some </span>\n<em>\n<span>brat</span>\n</em>\n<span> in an </span>\n<em>\n<span>apron</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d he scoffed, curling his fists into said apron in open offense about his uniform. Spirits, boys really were all the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI would answer her, Nephew,\u201d Uncle said cheekily. \u201cLady Katara is a master Waterbender and we\u2019re surrounded by a great deal of boiling tea.\u201d Zuko pursed his lips into a fine line, his balled up hands smoking somewhat as he stared stubbornly down at the floor. After a moment or two, he muttered something quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t quite get that?\u201d Sokka demanded, holding his hand to his ear and stepping closer. Zuko flushed some more and mumbled something even more quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLouder Sparky!\u201d Toph shouted, striking a heel to the ground so a sharpened pillar emerged, stopping just below Zuko\u2019s chin, he jumped back into the wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI fell off a roof, alright,\u201d He yelled, fists completely on fire now. \u201cThey were still wet from yesterday\u2019s rain so I slipped and hit my head and didn\u2019t wake up until after dawn. When I got back, Uncle was gone but someone needed to run the shop so I didn\u2019t get a chance to go searching. There, are you all happy now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am,\u201d Sokka began with a big grin on his face, \u201cso happy I can\u2019t even describe it. You fell off a </span>\n<em>\n<span>roof</span>\n</em>\n<span>, I can\u2019t believe it, I will never be afraid of you ever again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSokka!\u201d Katara chastised, slapping her brother\u2019s arm, \u201cA fall that knocks you out for that long could be serious! Are you having any headaches? Blurred vision? Nausea? Come here, I\u2019m a healer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Zuko, I fall off things all the time, it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about. Oh! Uncle said you like animals so I promise, when we find Appa, that\u2019s my Sky Bison, I\u2019ll let you have extra pets and snuggle time to cheer you up!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d Zuko muttered in a daze as Uncle and the Waterbender manhandled him into a chair and began fussing over him. \u201cIs it possible to die of shame?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh you know nothing of shame,\u201d Sokka said with manic glee as he knelt down to Zuko\u2019s level. \u201cBecause now that I know you\u2019re not being physically and mentally tortured, I can appreciate </span>\n<em>\n<span>all the wonderful stories</span>\n</em>\n<span> your Uncle told us. Everything from crying at the end of period romances to rescuing turtle crabs from hawks on the beach. I have so much beautiful material to work with that it will take me this lifetime and the next to cover it all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUncle!\u201d Zuko shouted, betrayed as he never had been by the one family member he thought would always protect him. Azula was right, you really couldn\u2019t trust anyone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am sorry Prince Zuko but I needed to distract myself from my worries somehow, consider it your punishment for scaring me half to death,\u201d Iroh shrugged, his face calm and unrepentant before he went back to discussing </span>\n<em>\n<span>care options</span>\n</em>\n<span> with the girl.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEarthbender, can you please end my misery and pull me underground to let me suffocate,\u201d Zuko begged. He swore he would never again ask for mercy after his banishment but these were extenuating circumstances.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah,\u201d Toph proclaimed, picking at her nose, \u201cwe worked too hard to find you, ask me again tomorrow.\u201d And that was the real horror, there was going to</span>\n<em>\n<span> be</span>\n</em>\n<span> a tomorrow with the Avatar\u2019s group. They knew he and uncle were in the city, they knew where they worked, </span>\n<em>\n<span>they knew all Zuko\u2019s embarrassing childhood stories</span>\n</em>\n<span>. The mortifying ordeal of being known to the biggest enemies of the Fire Nation was a nightmare that could only happen in this spirit blasted city of Ba Sing Se, the City of No Good, Awful, Terrible Reunions.. He going to deep fry whoever wrote that old time song.</span>\n</p>"
