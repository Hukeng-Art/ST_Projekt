  "text": "<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a fair response.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you found him because\u2026?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>An even better response. Hawks isn\u2019t in the mood to answer it though; nor does he have one that won\u2019t compromise the state of his mission so instead he shrugs and says, \u201cI heard a cry; I was first on scene.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Naomasa nods and everyone else buys the tale - which is relief because how Hawks was going to explain trudging through back alleys with a <em>villain</em>, he doesn\u2019t know. There\u2019s a mixed bunch of people in the room - Naomasa, Sansa, Toshinori, Aizawa, Yamada - but they\u2019re all looking at one thing only. Specifically, the A-Rank villain known as Dabi who is, for all intents and purposes, currently five years old.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks is supposed to not know what it happened but he does. A simple accident, a young girl with a quirk she couldn\u2019t control, and suddenly they\u2019re here.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Here could be worse, Hawks reasons. At least, at five years of age, Dabi hasn\u2019t tried to murder him yet. Well, to be honest, that probably comes down to the fact that once the quirk had taken effect, Dabi had seemingly lost all memory up until that point and his mental age seems to have regressed as well. He\u2019d come with Hawks only after he\u2019d flashed his hero license and was confident they were going to the police. He\u2019d fallen asleep on the way over which leads them to where they are now: Dabi asleep on Detective Naomasa\u2019s office couch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The change is startling, Hawks knows. He can see it on everyone\u2019s faces too. The scars are gone, and with it the accompanying staples. Dabi\u2019s tiny for his age, barely reaching even <em>Hawks</em>\u2019 waist. There are no piercings on his face but perhaps his most defining feature is his red hair. It\u2019s such a difference from the usual black.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are we going to do with him?\u201d Toshinori asks, coming to crouch beside the sofa and watching Dabi as he sleeps on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to question him, of course,\u201d Naomasa sighs, running a hand through his hair. \u201cBut besides from that\u2026\u201d His gaze flicks to Aizawa. \u201cYou have experience with this sort of-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice is painfully firm. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like Shinsou or Eri. This is a villain.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s a <em>child</em>,\u201d Naomasa stresses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe tried to kill my husband!\u201d Yamada screeches.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi flinches in his sleep, a frightened whimper escaping and despite his talk, Aizawa\u2019s hand is the first to land on his shoulder, shushing the boy and coaxing him back to sleep. Dabi settles with a deep exhale, slipping under once more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Aizawa says quietly and Hawks knows that\u2019s that even without having to look at Naomasa\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI could try,\u201d Toshinori offers. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ll admit to having never cared for a child before.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho\u2019s to say you even have to?\u201d Hawks asks, giving one of his wings a shake as it starts to itch. \u201cThis quirk could wear off any second. You\u2019re almost better off keeping him here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Sansa agrees, gaze watchful.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No one gets to say anymore there though because it seems Aizawa wasn\u2019t as successful as they\u2019d thought. Dabi stirs and slowly opens his eyes. He blinks at being surrounded before scrambling up. He nearly falls off the couch, Yamada supporting him with a hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEasy there, little listener. You\u2019re alright, you\u2019re with the police.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Naomasa hands over his badge, Dabi rolling it over in his tiny hands before giving it back. His voice, when he speaks, is so, so quiet. It\u2019s barely above a whisper and Hawks feels his heart break because somehow he can tell that this is his regular volume. \u201cAm I going home now? Did you call my mother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Naomasa says gently, taking a seat on the coffee table as Toshinori backs away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>To their shock, Dabi\u2019s eyes fly to the window before widening. \u201cI have to go!\u201d he says suddenly, trying to get to his feet only to be sat back down by Aizawa. \u201cP-please! I have to go!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo where?\u201d Aizawa drawls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHome,\u201d he stammers, squirming harder. \u201cIf I\u2019m not home before dark then Mother will get in trouble and Father will...will\u2026\u201d Dabi can\u2019t seem to continue, dissolving into tears.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa hisses and all his words are suddenly out the window. He\u2019s rounding the couch faster than even Hawks could, drawing Dabi to his chest and smoothing his hair down. \u201cIt\u2019s fine kid. They know, okay? They know you\u2019re here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi pauses, pulling away with a sniff. \u201cFather too?\u201d Aizawa nods, Dabi shying away. \u201cWas he...angry?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a pause before Naomasa answers. \u201cHe...understood.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi\u2019s expression flattens. \u201cFather doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He then stares at his lap glumly. \u201cOf course; you\u2019re the police. Father <em>can\u2019t</em> be angry at you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWherever your father is, I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t angry,\u201d Toshinori tries.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi snorts, and it\u2019s the first time Hawks sees him looking like his future self. \u201cFather\u2019s <em>always</em> angry,\u201d he spits. \u201cThat\u2019s why he hits us. That\u2019s why he hurts Mother. That\u2019s why she cries all the time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks winces, as do a few others in the room. Naomasa suddenly has a pen and paper in his hands, leaning forward ever so slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your father\u2019s name?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNaomasa,\u201d Aizawa warns quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t. You can\u2019t stop this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The detective swears but Hawks knows Aizawa\u2019s right. All of this happened a long time ago. They can\u2019t stop it now. Dabi looks between them in confusion but he never answers the question. Interesting. Hawks gives him a nudge but Dabi shakes his head furiously. Somehow though, the switch has been flipped and from that point on, Dabi won\u2019t talk to them at all. Clearly he\u2019s more terrified of his father than he is of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI hate this,\u201d Aizawa says once they\u2019ve left the room and Dabi is alone with Sansa, drawing with some pencils they found in a storeroom. \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yamada pulls him into his arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to feel sorry for him. I get it Shouta.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLife gets rough for the kid,\u201d Hawks sighs, peering in the window. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m looking at a villain right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo one is born a villain,\u201d Toshinori says, and there\u2019s something painful in there that Hawks doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cThey\u2019re made them by circumstances. I only wish we could stop those circumstances sooner. Not just for Dabi, but for all villains.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve been the number one hero for too long,\u201d Aizawa grouses, removing himself from Yamada\u2019s embrace. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori glares at him but Naomasa comes between them, shaking his head. \u201cThis is no place for such an argument. And really, you two shouldn\u2019t be having it at all. You\u2019re adults and heroes for your own reasons. Keep it that way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori looks suitably scolded, Aizawa merely defensive. Before anything else can be said though, Sansa is gesturing through the window silently and that\u2019s enough to grab their attention. It\u2019s for good reason too because Dabi has since shifted and is leaning over the table to draw. Which gives them a wonderful view of his back...and the plethora of bruises that cover it. He may have been changed into clothes roughly his size, but shirts ride up and what was hidden underneath this one is enough to make Hawks\u2019 stomach turn.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t do that to him on the way over,\u201d is the first thing he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sure not,\u201d Naomasa murmurs even as Toshinori goes pale and Aizawa\u2019s jaw clenches.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf his <em>father</em> did that to him,\u201d Aizawa hisses, Yamada placing a hand on his arm even as he\u2019s on the phone. Hawks wonders who he\u2019s calling but Yamada answers that himself soon enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRecovery Girl\u2019s on her way. If nothing else, she can make him feel a little better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s nothing they can do except wait for Chiyo to arrive. She bustles her way in a good half an hour later. Dabi has since grown bored of drawing but is still locked in the detective\u2019s office - not that he knows it. He\u2019s taken to asking Sansa about his quirk or at least, the cat related aspects of it. The first thing Chiyo does is dismiss Sansa before ushering Dabi back onto the sofa he\u2019d occupied previously. Dabi\u2019s apprehensive, that much is obvious, but it\u2019s obvious Chiyo has done this before.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve been asked to check over you,\u201d she says, placing a hand on his knee. \u201cMy name\u2019s Chiyo. My quirk can heal people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi\u2019s interest is gained there, feet swinging. \u201cCan you heal everything?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMost things,\u201d Chiyo replies with a hum, going through the whole rigmarole of checking his reflexes and shining lights in his eyes. \u201cAnd what about you? Do you have a quirk?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi freezes. Chiyo doesn\u2019t push him though and eventually he whispers, \u201cI have one. I don\u2019t use it though. It hurts people. I don\u2019t want to hurt people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chiyo frowns, as do Aizawa and Naomasa. \u201cQuirks don\u2019t hurt people unless we want them to,\u201d she scolds. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t use it, how will you learn to control it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf I don\u2019t use it, I don\u2019t need to control it,\u201d Dabi argues back, though his shoulders are hunched over, showing how unconfident he really is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI see,\u201d is all Chiyo says. \u201cI can\u2019t help but notice your shoulders look stiff. Does your back hurt?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi reels back, shaking his head furiously. One look from Chiyo has him wilting though. With great, <em>great</em> reluctance he turns around, lifting his shirt. Hawks\u2019 stomach drops to the floor and Aizawa swears. Because Dabi looks <em>terrible</em>. His skin is mottled because of how extensive the marks are and, with a shiver, Hawks notes how similar he looks to his adult state.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis looks bad,\u201d Chiyo tuts, looking but not touching. \u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Dabi murmurs, tugging his shirt back down and wrapping his arms around his chest vulnerably. \u201cIt\u2019s just training. I...Father says I have a good quirk. That I...I can be better than All Might and I...I need to train. It\u2019s just training,\u201d he repeats hoarsely. \u201cTraining to be the best.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a sob from his left, Hawks\u2019 eyes flying over to see Toshinori hiding his face in a hand as his shoulders shake. \u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d he chokes on his next words. \u201cI...That isn\u2019t what being the number one hero is about. To do that...to your <em>child</em>\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The once Symbol of Peace breaks down further, Naomasa sighing and rubbing his back soothingly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d he murmurs but all Toshinori does is shake his head. Hawks agrees.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Their attention is ripped away though when Chiyo flips open a file, tapping at something at the top. \u201cOh dear, look at this. They didn\u2019t even write your name down! How silly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi giggles there. The villain <em>fucking giggles</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But then the weight of that sentence slams into them all. Because no one knows Dabi\u2019s identity. They hadn\u2019t, in all honesty, even <em>thought</em> to ask. If Hawks had to guess, it\u2019s because they all simply assumed Dabi was Dabi. They hadn\u2019t thought to look at that deeper level.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya,\u201d Dabi supplies - or Touya, Hawks supposes, although that feels wrong.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya,\u201d Chiyo parrots, writing that down. \u201cWhat a lovely name.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi blushes and dammit, villains aren\u2019t meant to be cute, even in child form! Hawks pushes that thought aside even as Naomasa is hastily scribbling down the name. He knows that before the day is out, Dabi\u2019s real identity will be known by everyone in the hero community.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd here?\u201d Chiyo asks, indicating a different empty box; Touya\u2019s family name, if Hawks had to guess. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi leans over to see better, all too chipper when he answers. \u201cTodoroki!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The whole room stills. It\u2019s like the air gets sucked out of the office. Hawks thinks every inch of body heat has left him. Toshinori is paler than Hawks has ever seen, while Aizawa looks ready to murder. Even Recovery Girl looks thrown, so much so that Dabi\u2019s head cocks to the side, all five-year-old innocence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want me to write it?\u201d he asks, all politeness. \u201cI can!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He takes the pen and writes the kanji and even as slow and wobbling as he is, Hawks knows what Dabi\u2019s writing. He isn\u2019t lying. Todoroki Touya, aka Dabi. It\u2019s at this point Chiyo regains her wits even if Dabi seems bored now, comfortable enough around her to climb all over the couch. Complimenting him, it seems, did wonders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you tell me who\u2019s in your family?\u201d Chiyo asks, just to dig the hole deeper, to confirm what they already know.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi shrugs and nods all at the same time. \u201cThere\u2019s Father and Mother. Father has a fire quirk and I don\u2019t like him. Mother has an ice quirk but she\u2019s nice.\u201d He grins there before bouncing up and down a few times. \u201cAnd there\u2019s Fuyumi; she\u2019s three, I\u2019m five! And Natsuo too but he\u2019s only a baby. I don\u2019t know his quirk yet. But we don\u2019t have the perfect quirk,\u201d Dabi babbles on. \u201cFather says even though I\u2019m strong, I can\u2019t really beat All Might so Mother has to have more babies.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori drops into a chair then and Hawks would have thought he\u2019d fainted if not for the fact that his eyes are very much open and tears are streaming down his cheeks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd so he makes Shouto,\u201d Aizawa growls, Yamada grabbing him before he can punch something. \u201cLike his wife and children are nothing more than mere <em>tools</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks can\u2019t wrap his head around the concept itself. Even as more and more of Dabi\u2019s traits and frivolous throw away lines start to fall into place, Hawks still struggles to believe it because it\u2019s <em>Endeavour</em>. And Endeavour is everything he\u2019s ever wanted to be but he can\u2019t be if he\u2019s like <em>this</em>. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Naomasa stopped writing long ago. He looks like he doesn\u2019t know what to do. Hawks doesn\u2019t blame him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c-nd here, I\u2019m on a rainbow,\u201d Dabi is explaining to Chiyo, pointing at his drawing like he hasn\u2019t just potentially torn the station and the current hero rankings apart.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d Chiyo prods, barely holding herself together from what Hawks can tell.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAway,\u201d is all Dabi says, Hawks swearing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chiyo ruffles his hair, handing him some gummies. \u201cWell, you seem alright to me now Touya. I\u2019ll show the detective back in, alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi shrugs, unconcerned. Chiyo makes it as far as the door before turning around, asking one last question. \u201cWhen you grow up young Touya, what do you want to be? What do you want to do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do I want to do?\u201d Dabi repeats. He frowns for a moment before grinning and it looks so, so wrong. \u201cWhen I grow up, I\u2019m going to kill my father.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everyone whips around even as Yamada is stammering incomprehensibly. \u201cSh-Shouta, you can\u2019t! He\u2019s-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA villain?\u201d Aizawa asks before shaking his head, eyes turning to the room Dabi is in, pushing a toy truck across the coffee table. \u201cNaomasa was right. This is a <em>child</em>. A scared one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAizawa,\u201d Naomasa warns. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when this quirk will wear off. It\u2019s safest to keep him here. It\u2019s what\u2019s best.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy quick can stop his,\u201d he returns quickly enough. \u201cAnd do you honestly believe that? Do you think you should keep a five-year-old here? Would you put him in a cell?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAizawa, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Toshinori says but Naomasa stops him with a hand, sighing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, he\u2019s right. What we\u2019re dealing with now is not Dabi, but <em>Touya</em>. The real best thing for him would be to return him to his family but\u2026\u201d Naomasa cringes. \u201cWith what he\u2019s said, I <em>can\u2019t</em>. In no way can I justify putting him into that situation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The agreements are unanimous and Hawks has to make an excuse just so he can leave the room. The thoughts whirling through his head are too much and it feels like Dabi\u2019s presence is looming over him. \u201cI\u2019ll head back to where I found him and see if there were any cameras nearby. The more we know about this quirk, the better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Naomasa nods thankfully and Hawks takes his leave. Naomasa then shoots Toshinori a look and he reluctantly bids farewell as well. Everyone in the room knows his shoulders are weighed down with more than just pain and age old weariness now. This afternoon has taken its toll on the once Symbol of Peace. Some ugly things have come out and everyone has their own way of dealing. Whether it\u2019s good or not is another question all together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Naomasa asks, one last time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa glances at Yamada who gives a helpless shrug before nodding. \u201cWe\u2019re sure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Aizawa had had any second guesses about Touya not being a real five-year-old, they\u2019re dashed the moment Naomasa takes Touya aside and explains to him the truth of his situation. He can\u2019t understand it - he\u2019s actually twenty-four? He doesn\u2019t live at home? He can\u2019t see his family? It\u2019s too much for a child and while he comes with Aizawa and Yamada, he cries all the way to their apartment. Not great heaving sobs but quiet sniffles, like he knows crying won\u2019t get him any results but he\u2019s too upset to hold it in. Aizawa pities him, scooping the kid up as soon as they park and tucking him into his neck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get inside.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya nods but a whimper still escapes. \u201cI want Mother.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s all he\u2019s asked for and it\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s impossible. Aizawa doesn\u2019t know the details but he knows one simple truth: Todoroki Rei lives in the mental ward of a hospital. Touya absolutely cannot stay with her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dinner is a quiet affair. Yamada tries to lighten the mood and while he gets a smile or two, he never gets a laugh. Touya showers when told to and comes back in an old shirt they\u2019d found; it comes past his knees for how short he is. Aizawa bundles him up and tucks him into what was once Shinsou\u2019s bed. He leaves the door open a crack and tells Touya to find them if he needs anything. Touya hesitates before catching his sleeve, eyes brimming with tears once more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was good,\u201d he whispers, wiping his eyes with his spare hand. \u201cI ate all my dinner and even the vegetables. I wasn\u2019t loud and I didn\u2019t make a mess. I was <em>good</em>,\u201d he repeats brokenly. \u201cCan I...Can I see Mother now? Am I not in trouble anymore?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yamada swears from where he\u2019s eavesdropping and Aizawa is dropping into a crouch at the same moment, brushing Touya\u2019s hair back. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in trouble kid. You never were. This is just...a quirk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa knows he\u2019s going to regret this but it can\u2019t hurt. \u201cSleep tonight and we\u2019ll see your mother in the morning, alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya\u2019s eyes widen before he nods quickly. He scrubs his face messily and then burrows under the blankets. He isn\u2019t asleep by any means but there\u2019s nothing more Aizawa can do. He murmurs a quiet goodnight before leaving the room. Yamada smiles at him weakly and Aizawa just drops onto the sofa. He\u2019d forgotten how hard this was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He goes to sleep a couple of hours later to the sound of hiccuping sobs coming from the bedroom down the hall. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The morning goes a little better. Touya is a tad more talkative and smiles a little more but he\u2019s also antsy. He wants to go, that much is obvious. Aizawa has to pull him up multiple times and warn him that he\u2019s not staying with his mother, just visiting. Touya nods but Aizawa knows he doesn\u2019t believe him. This afternoon is not going to be fun; not at all. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But that\u2019s later\u2019s problem and Aizawa is now walking through the hospital corridors looking for Todoroki Rei\u2019s room. Touya is silent at his side, overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle going on around them. He\u2019s back in the clothes he\u2019d worn yesterday, freshly washed and crisp. He\u2019s on his absolute best behaviour and Aizawa cannot even fathom how this sweet child becomes everything Dabi is. Unfortunately, Touya can\u2019t give him any answers. He, if anything, would only be <em>more</em> clueless.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rapping on the door labelled \u2018<em>Todoroki</em>\u2019, Aizawa\u2019s met with a call to enter. Touya perks up, recognising the voice. He wrenches open the door before Aizawa can ask him to wait.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMother!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The precise moment he does so is the precise moment Aizawa realises he should have done more research. Even as he\u2019s reaching for Touya to haul him back, Todoroki Rei is screaming, lashing out and only missing Touya because Aizawa grabs him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cM-Mother?\u201d Touya asks, shaking violently.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not...you\u2019re\u2026\u201d Rei is deathly pale and shaking almost as severely. \u201cTake him away,\u201d she begs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa scoops Touya up with a nod, grunting as the boy flails in his arms. \u201cTouya, stop.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, but Mother!\u201d Touya wails, trying to scramble over his shoulder. \u201cMother <em>please</em>, it\u2019s me! Mother, it\u2019s <em>Touya</em>! <em>Mother</em>!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa shushes him quite sternly as the elevator opens and Touya does but probably only because he\u2019s sobbing into his shoulder. Aizawa sighs, chest heavy with guilt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmurs, rubbing Touya\u2019s back. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she would do that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Touya sobs. \u201cIs it because I didn\u2019t come home? You <em>said</em> you told Father!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t because of that,\u201d Aizawa grunts but Touya just kicks him petulantly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The elevator deposits them on the ground floor and Aizawa is fully intending to leave when he hears his name being called. Oh god, he recognises that voice. Turning around, Aizawa thinks the situation can\u2019t get any worse until he sees that the owner of the voice is not alone. It\u2019s worse. Because there, standing barely three feet away, are Midoriya Izuku and Toshinori. Of course they are.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr. Aizawa?\u201d Izuku questions, stepping closer to get a look at the boy in his arms. \u201cOh, hello. Are you alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya eyes up Midoriya for a moment before shaking his head. Midoriya grimaces before peering up at Aizawa curiously. Aizawa knows what that look\u2019s asking but he ignores it, preferring to turn the tables. \u201cWhat are you doing here Midoriya?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, I\u2019m seeing a physical therapist!\u201d he pipes up brightly, holding out his mangled hand. \u201cThere\u2019s still some stiffness so I\u2019m working to get full movement back!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa gives a satisfied nod before lifting his gaze. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori spreads his hands helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a rather frequent visitor around these parts. But luckily I had young Midoriya join me today!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya beams like Toshinori\u2019s just hung the stars for him, Aizawa mentally rolling his eyes. But then he gets caught because he\u2019s out of questions to hide behind, Midoriya hesitantly smiling at Touya again. \u201cAnd this is...?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa could not answer but with Midoriya, that would probably only make it worse. Instead he levels the student with a glare. \u201cMidoriya, what I\u2019m about to tell you <em>cannot</em> leave this hospital, do you understand?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya\u2019s expression turns frightfully serious, something Aizawa has rarely seen him do. \u201cI understand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa eyes him up before nodding, coaxing Touya\u2019s head up. \u201cThis is Todoroki Touya. Yesterday he was hit by a quirk that de-aged him some nineteen years.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cTodoroki\u2019s...older brother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya blinks, frowning. \u201cTodo-...you know Natsuo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNatsuo?\u201d Midoriya repeats, shaking his head. \u201cNo, I-...\u201d Midoriya hastily cuts off, a hand clapping over his mouth. The damage is already done though.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa draws Touya up to eye level. \u201cMidoriya here goes to class with your little brother, Shouto. You haven\u2019t met him yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSh...Shouto\u2026\u201d Touya murmurs, rolling the name over his tongue. \u201cHe...is he littler than Natsuo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have a photo!\u201d Midoriya offers, fossicking through his pocket until he finds his phone. He then goes frightfully still, breath catching. \u201cYou\u2019re...Aizawa, how old is Touya?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m five!\u201d Touya cuts in before Aizawa can, folding his arms and pouting, clearly offended Midoriya thought he didn\u2019t know.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If anything, Midoriya goes <em>paler</em>. Over his head, Aizawa and Toshinori exchange looks. \u201c<em>Midoriya</em>.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice is painfully stern and makes the boy cower. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya shakes his head quickly. \u201cTodoroki wouldn\u2019t want me to say.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa raises an eyebrow coolly. \u201cI got an earful from Touya yesterday. If I find you\u2019re keeping something potentially dangerous a secret, you\u2019ll be in trouble with someone far more frightening than Todoroki.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya squeaks and Toshinori tries to defend him but Aizawa won\u2019t have it. Eventually Midoriya folds, hands wringing together nervously. \u201cUh...that is...Todoroki said when he was five, his, uh...his mother\u2026\u201d Midoriya gestures loosely at where Aizawa knows Todoroki\u2019s scar is. \u201cBecause he...he looked like\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa holds up a hand there, not wanting Touya to hear too many gruesome details. Besides, it\u2019s not like he and Toshinori don\u2019t know what Midoriya was going to say anyway:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Todoroki Rei burnt Shouto for looking like Endeavour.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Looking at the boy in his arms, Aizawa swears. Touya, if anything, looks <em>more</em> like Enji. It\u2019s no wonder she panicked upon seeing him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYoung Midoriya, why didn\u2019t you tell anyone?\u201d Toshinori asks gently.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya shrugs. \u201cI...Why didn\u2019t Todoroki?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa lets it slide, waving Toshinori away. It still hasn\u2019t solved the problem of what he\u2019s going to do with Touya now. He may have swapped to snivelling but Aizawa\u2019s sure he\u2019s just minutes away from another bout of tears. Midoriya seems to realise this, awkwardly holding out a hand. \u201cThere are some beautiful gardens here Touya, with animals made of trees. Would you like to see?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya hesitates, leaning forward only to snap back and hide against Aizawa\u2019s chest somewhat. \u201cAre you...a hero?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya blinks twice before nodding, reaching into his wallet and pulling out his provisional hero license and handing it over. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a hero just like All Might!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori abruptly hacks into his hand but Touya doesn\u2019t notice, just smiles the tiniest bit. \u201cYeah, he seems nice,\u201d he whispers, handing the license back and pushing at Aizawa to indicate he wants down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa does so and Midoriya takes Touya\u2019s hand, leading him out the southern door of reception. Aizawa follows, Toshinori on his heels. The gardens prove to be a good distraction and Midoriya is a surprisingly good babysitter. For all his jittering and incessant ramblings, he\u2019s actually calm and soft around Touya. It\u2019s like he\u2019s found Touya\u2019s volume level and is keeping them on the same page. According to Toshinori, he\u2019s exactly like Midoriya Inko. Aizawa doesn\u2019t question how he knows that and let\u2019s the old hero go and join his protege. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa turns at the voice, having to beat down the surprise he feels. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the trouble we caused earlier.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki Rei shakes her head. \u201cThat...I\u2019m afraid that was on me.\u201d She steps to Aizawa\u2019s side, glancing down at where Midoriya and Touya are. \u201cI...When you left, you called him Touya. Was I mistaken?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa shakes his head. \u201cHe was hit with a quirk yesterday. He has no memories from any time after age five.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cHe...he said he was five?\u201d Aizawa nods. \u201cOh. Then he...Natsuo would have just been born. He doesn\u2019t know Shouto yet, or...or why I\u2019m here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa agrees. \u201cAnd I apologise for bringing him to see you without warning. Had I known his presence would have been upsetting, we wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei shakes her head. \u201cI...panicked. He reminded me so much of Shouto, of their father, and it took me back. All I could hear was Shouto crying. But\u2026\u201d Her hands clench into fists. \u201cThis is <em>Touya</em>. Am I...am I allowed to see him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa grimaces. \u201cIs that best for him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei hesitates before nodding. \u201cYes. He needs me to tell him I\u2019m sorry.\u201d With that, she cups her hands around her mouth. \u201cTouya!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya\u2019s head snaps up from where he\u2019s crawling through Midoriya\u2019s legs. His face then splits into a grin and he sprints over the lawn. Rei crouches down and Touya crashes into her chest, hands fisted in her dress. She\u2019s already crying, scooping him up and hugging him fiercely. \u201cMy Touya, my little light.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya hugs back just as tightly, kissing her cheek. \u201cAre you okay now Mother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei deliberates on that before shaking her head, taking Touya\u2019s face in her hands. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not very well. Sometimes...things that shouldn\u2019t scare me do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya frowns. \u201cLike me shouting?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei taps his nose. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t run and shout indoors do we?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya flushes, burying his face in Rei\u2019s neck. She laughs softly, fingers combing through his hair. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I\u2019m living here Touya, so the doctor\u2019s can help me get better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya doesn\u2019t answer that and Rei takes it, just continuing to play with his hair. She looks up and smiles, offering a small wave. \u201cHello Midoriya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya smiles right back. \u201cHi Mrs. Rei. Sorry for not coming to see you, I was on my way out when I ran into Mr. Aizawa.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She waves him off. \u201cAnd how is Shouto?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s coming up this evening,\u201d Midoriya replies, \u201cSo I\u2019d better not answer! He\u2019ll get cross.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei looks scandalised in a teasing way. \u201cWith you Midoriya? Never.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya goes bright red and Toshinori decides to have pity on him. He announces they\u2019re leaving and they do just that, leaving Aizawa alone with Rei. There\u2019s a space between them but he never goes far enough away that he can\u2019t get to Touya within a second if things go south. Although, they don\u2019t look like they will. With just a few strokes to the cheek, Touya is asleep in Rei\u2019s arms, so much the opposite of what a villain should be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t visit, you know,\u201d Rei murmurs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa isn\u2019t surprised. Dabi would never make it through the front door. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw him?\u201d he asks instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei bows her head in shame. \u201cTen years ago. He was...The last time I saw Touya, he was worrying over his high school applications. I never knew what he chose.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa feels a tad bit of anger there. Had no one thought to write? Had Rei never thought to ask? Or had they not been allowed? </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he says honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about your son.\u201d At her despondent face, he scrounges around for something, anything. \u201cHe dyes his hair,\u201d Aizawa manages to offer. \u201cIt\u2019s black now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei\u2019s smile is watery. \u201cHe was always talking of doing that. I never thought he would.\u201d She tucks Touya closer, thumbing his cheek tenderly. \u201cI...Enji was always so hard on Shouto - because of his quirk, because of his potential. I spent a lot of time with Shouto because of it. I...Touya had to basically raise his siblings but\u2026\u201d Her bottom lip trembles. \u201cI would never say this aloud to anyone else but...Touya was my favourite. He was the softest, the gentlest. He was so <em>kind</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa is making sure to look anywhere but at Rei. Because as sweet as it is, her precious, \u2018kind\u2019 boy ends up becoming someone who has over twenty deaths in their ledger. He\u2019s tried to kill his father, he\u2019s tried to kill Aizawa, he kidnapped Bakugou. Aizawa knows he taunted Shouto - to his <em>face</em> nonetheless - and he\u2019s a part of one of the most ruthless crime organisations in Japan. Somewhere along the line, Touya changes into Dabi and Aizawa doesn\u2019t have the heart to tell this frail woman that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Looking at the time, Aizawa sighs. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei wilts but nods. She goes to wake Touya but then seems to think better of it. \u201cIf I say goodbye, he\u2019ll only be more upset.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa knows it\u2019s true. He\u2019s extending his arms to take the child when,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>...fuck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa is positive he recognises the voice before Todoroki Rei does; that in itself says enough. Approaching them with a bewildered look on his face is Todoroki Shouto. He must have finished his errands earlier than Midoriya had said. Unfortunate; Aizawa was hoping to get away before he arrived. But he hasn\u2019t which means he now has to deal with...this. To be honest, he isn\u2019t sure what to make of this. Neither of the Todorokis seem to either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa then squints at Shouto, rolling his eyes at the odd look on his face and really? He thought this boy was <em>smart</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki, you\u2019re not an older brother; drop the look.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei jerks up but Shouto very quickly looks to the side, awkwardly clearing his throat. Aizawa rolls his eyes, taking that moment to scoop Touya up. He glances at Rei but she merely gestures him towards Shouto, Aizawa sighing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki, this is Touya. As you can see, he was influenced by a quirk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki freezes for a moment before turning slowly, eyes a tad wider than normal. He cautiously approaches. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t remember him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rei bites back a sob there, Aizawa scowling. One day, very soon, he\u2019s going to find out exactly what Todoroki Enji did to this family. \u201cThat makes you equal then,\u201d is what he says. \u201cBecause Touya doesn\u2019t remember you either.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki blinks before nodding. \u201cAh, the quirk erased his memory?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He turns to Rei and bows shortly. \u201cThank you for having us; I\u2019ll be heading off now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She shakes her head. \u201cI should be the one thanking you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa makes it barely a metre before a voice calls after him. \u201cWait!\u201d Todoroki is standing between the two, swaying uncertainly until Rei gives him an encouraging nudge. \u201cI\u2019d like to come with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa mulls that over, eventually nodding. \u201cAlright, but on the terms you also contact your brother and sister.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t say that there are things he needs to tell them - not in front of Rei - but Todoroki nods anyway. They head to Aizawa\u2019s car, Aizawa ushering Todoroki into the back seat before lying Touya next to him. He stirs but doesn\u2019t wake, both of them sighing in relief. As Aizawa slides into the front seat he adds, </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if he cries. As far as he knows, he still lives at home. This is all confusing for him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki is silent for a long time. \u201c...it would be.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa doesn\u2019t know what to say to that and so doesn\u2019t say anything. The only time Todoroki speaks is to ask for his address, which Aizawa passes on. Todoroki fiddles with his phone and Aizawa can only assume he\u2019s messaging his siblings. He then pockets the device and lets his gaze drop to Touya. He seems afraid to touch; he would only be <em>more</em> so if he knew who Touya grew up to be. Aizawa\u2019s still wrapping his head around it himself; that this small, quiet, and supposedly kind boy turns into something much worse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s as they\u2019re making the second to last turn that Touya stirs. He blearily calls for his mother but when he gets no response, Touya shoots straight up. He sees Aizawa before he sees Todoroki and the tears are already coming before Todoroki, blessedly, cuts in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...hello.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe not so blessedly then.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya whips around, scrambling away all while stammering for a hero license. For someone who becomes a villain, he seems particularly obsessed with making sure everyone who interacts with him is a hero. Todoroki passes his over, Touya scrunching his face up at it before brightening.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, this is my name!\u201d he chirps, pointing at their family kanji. Todoroki nods, Touya peering up at him before clapping his hands. \u201cMidomiya called you Sho-...Shou-...Shouto!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki corrects absently. He then holds out a hand, Touya shaking it. \u201cTodoroki Shouto.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki Touya,\u201d Touya whispers, suddenly all shy again. Aizawa parks the car and Touya scrambles over Todoroki\u2019s lap to get to the door. When Todoroki tries to pull him up, Touya pokes his tongue out. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest brother! I go first.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m sixteen right now. Which makes me bigger than you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell I\u2019m really sixteen and a half!\u201d Touya crows. \u201cAnd a grandfather!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He is no such thing but it makes Todoroki hesitate long enough for Touya to open the door and slide to the ground. Aizawa is already waiting, ready to stop him from running into the carpark. Todoroki follows them up to Aizawa\u2019s apartment, the three of them toeing off their shoes before padding down the hall. Yamada already has lunch on the table. He sees Todoroki and adds an extra plate. Todoroki glances between them suspiciously and Aizawa starts to wonder if this kid is a member of the tin-foil hat brigade.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d Yamada says as they\u2019re all seated. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya clams up and Yamada gives Aizawa a look that clearly says \u2018that bad huh?\u2019. \u201cIt was fine,\u201d Aizawa answers, waving a hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMother\u2019s sick,\u201d Touya finally mumbles, slumping lower in his chair as he picks at his rice. \u201cSo she has to stay at the hospital.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki\u2019s jaw tightens there and right, there\u2019s obviously more to that then.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya abandons his food and turns to Todoroki instead. \u201cYou\u2019re sick too, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki frowns. \u201cNo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou <em>are</em>,\u201d Touya insists, climbing up on his chair and turning Todoroki\u2019s face in his hands, jabbing a finger at his scar. Everyone freezes. \u201cYou have a sore here. If you pick at it, it won\u2019t get better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luckily, Todoroki simply nods. \u201cI see. I\u2019ll do that. Now sit down,\u201d he adds in a murmur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya does so but not without grumbling. \u201cI\u2019m still the bigges-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His sentence is abruptly cut off as his arm flings out and knocks his cup over. Aizawa doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal until Touya suddenly pushes his chair back as quickly as he can. For a moment Aizawa thinks he doesn\u2019t want to get wet but the truth is much worse, as evidenced by Touya backing into the nearest wall and crossing his arms in front of his face, clearly terrified that he\u2019s going to be struck. Aizawa\u2019s hands curl into fists. A <em>five-year-old</em> thinks he\u2019s going to be <em>punished</em> for knocking over a <em>glass of water</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Touya shrieks as Yamada rounds the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d the hero calls, kneeling down and slowly, gently places a hand on Touya\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay little listener. It was just an accident. We can clean it up, alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya peeps through his fingers hesitantly. \u201cI...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said that,\u201d Yamada teases. \u201cAnd I said it\u2019s fine. So come help me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still Touya hesitates.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yamada sighs, lowering Touya\u2019s arms and guiding his chin up, tone serious. \u201cHey Touya, listen. You spill that water, we\u2019ll get you another. You spill that one, we\u2019ll get you another. You spill that one...well, I\u2019ll ask you to be more careful but we\u2019ll still get you another, alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya doesn\u2019t nod or show any signs of agreement but he meekly heads back to the table, stopping beside the water that\u2019s dripped onto the floor. Yamada understands, pulling off two pieces of paper towel and handing one over. Together the mess takes them less than a minute to clean up and Aizawa catches the look Yamada gives him over Touya\u2019s head. Aizawa nods, surreptitiously glancing at Todoroki. He\u2019s remaining very quiet and finding his lunch a little too interesting. God, this family really is a mess. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yamada looks at him again but Aizawa gives the slightest shake of his head. Yes, they need to address this but he\u2019ll do it later. Do it when there\u2019s not a five-year-old present. There are some things Touya doesn\u2019t need to know. He doesn\u2019t need to hear how bad things get.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After lunch is quieter. Aizawa steers Touya towards the toybox in the living room and sends Todoroki after him. Touya scrounges through it before pulling out some blocks. The two brothers play together quietly while Aizawa washes the dishes and Yamada dries them. It\u2019s as they\u2019re finishing up that Todoroki approaches.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuyumi and Natsuo are five minutes away,\u201d he relays, phone in hand. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa gives a grunt of acknowledgement before heading to where Touya is. Touya is immersed in building what he says is a castle but Aizawa coaxes him away, biting back a smile as Touya squirms on the couch, clearly eager to get back to his game. It\u2019s obvious he knows he has to behave though. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya,\u201d he says, slowly and clearly, enough so to have the boy stiffen. \u201cSome people are going to come here and visit you. You know them but...They\u2019re going to look different to how you remember.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya hunkers down, nodding silently.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa frowns. \u201cTouya?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya\u2019s hands fist in his pants. \u201cIs...is Father mad at me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa has to refrain from hitting something. Instead, he ducks down so he\u2019s meeting Touya\u2019s gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming. But your brother and sister are.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya\u2019s mouth drops open. \u201cFuyumi and Natsuo are coming here?\u201d At Aizawa\u2019s nod, he looks to Shouto, frowning. \u201cAre they big? Bigger than me? Are they even bigger than Shouto? Do they know that I\u2019m still the biggest? I\u2019m five, remember!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yamada laughs loudly and even Shouto chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell them,\u201d Aizawa assures.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At that moment, the doorbell rings. Aizawa makes a warning sound when Touya goes to stand and so he remains seated on the couch. He\u2019s bouncing up and down excitedly though. Todoroki goes for the door and Aizawa can hear his siblings asking questions but Todoroki is poor with his answers - as always - and has explained literally nothing by the time they reach the living room. The two Todorokis spot Touya almost immediately, Fuyumi frowning in confusion while Natsuo all but knocks Aizawa aside in his attempt to reach his brother.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cT-Touya?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fuyumi makes an incredulous noise but Touya nods even as his head cocks to the side. He cautiously reaches out, hand resting on Natsuo\u2019s cheek. \u201cNatsuo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s all it takes, Natsuo crushing his brother in his arms. Aizawa wonders how long it\u2019s been since they\u2019ve seen each other. Somewhere behind him his phone starts to ring but Yamada lets him know he\u2019s got it, which is good because Aizawa is a little busy right now. Fuyumi slowly comes over too, sinking to her knees and running trembling fingers through Touya\u2019s hair. \u201cIs it...is it really you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is,\u201d Aizawa says for him. \u201cAs you can guess, this is the effect of a quirk. He doesn\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo stares at him incredulously before pushing Touya away and holding him by the shoulders. \u201cYou don\u2019t...Touya, how old am I?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya gestures with his hands; apparently Natsuo is the size of a loaf of bread. Natsuo breathes out shakily. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t know what to say. Touya fills the silence for him, fisting his hands on his hips. \u201cI know you\u2019re big,\u201d he says as sternly as a small child can, \u201cBut I am the biggest, okay? You have to do what I say because I\u2019m older.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo laughs loudly, hands falling away to clutch at his sides. Fuyumi giggles too, drawing Touya close and hugging him tightly. \u201cOf course,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be our big brother Touya.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMother knows,\u201d Todoroki says, taking a seat next to Touya. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This makes his siblings look up. Natsuo glances at Aizawa in confusion, to which he nods. \u201cHe wanted to see her. He\u2019s five; there\u2019s a lot he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo understands immediately, taking Touya back from Fuyumi and starting to tussle with him. Touya giggles and squeals, seemingly somehow at ease with this \u201cstranger\u201d who claims to be his brother. Maybe he can sense the connection; Aizawa doesn\u2019t know - he\u2019s an only child himself. Family bonds are strange that way. Fuyumi is watching them while chewing on her bottom lip. Eventually she says,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd Father? How soon will he be coming to collect him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Fuyumi!</em>\u201d Natsuo hisses but she glares back at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>What?</em> It\u2019s his son!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya won\u2019t be going home.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice is like a knife and makes all the Todorokis freeze, even Touya. His consequent glare is enough to make Fuyumi\u2019s mouth snap shut. \u201cTouya gave us some...eye-opening insights yesterday. In the interest of safety, we\u2019re keeping him away from Endeavour.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s also the fact that Touya is, in fact, Dabi and may attack on sight the moment this quirk wears off but it\u2019s not the <em>main</em> reason. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...what did he say?\u201d Todoroki asks after several long minutes of silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEnough,\u201d is all Aizawa replies, reaching out and ruffling Touya\u2019s hair; the boy is watching everything with wide eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; you\u2019re not in trouble.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya hesitates before nodding. Aizawa then excuses himself and tells them to enjoy the time they have together. The Todorokis do so but there\u2019s an air of...something hanging over them now. And maybe, maybe there always was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The four Todoroki children spend the afternoon in Aizawa and Yamada\u2019s living room. They rotate between playing games, watching tv, and digging through the - admittedly small - toybox. In Aizawa\u2019s defence, Shinsou is sixteen now and so doesn\u2019t play with toys and Eri only comes over when her minders at UA have rostered days off. But they make do.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa leaves them alone, retreating to the bedroom he shares with his husband. Yamada passes on the call he\u2019d taken earlier - information from Hawks - and then they settle into their usual Sunday routine of making lesson plans and grading papers. The occasional word is exchanged and Yamada bops along to the music in his head. The only reason the silence is broken is because there\u2019s a knock at their door. Both teachers look up, Natsuo standing there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya fell asleep. Fuyumi put him to bed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t say anything more but his tone says more than enough: we want answers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unfortunately, Aizawa doesn\u2019t have a lot to give them. Nevertheless, he needs to talk to them anyway so this is the perfect opportunity. Touya is asleep and Rei is not around. Endeavour is also, thankfully, nowhere near them. If Aizawa is going to have this conversation with anyone in the Todoroki clan, it\u2019s going to be these three. And so he ushers them all onto the couch. It\u2019s a tight squeeze but they manage to fit. Aizawa sits himself on the coffee table in front of them, Yamada bringing his marking to the dining table but making no move to be an active part of whatever this is going to turn into. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Perhaps naturally it\u2019s Fuyumi who speaks first. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Touya told you but I can assure you, Father is trying to change. He...I think it would do him good to see this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki\u2019s face is perfectly blank while Natsuo looks away with a disgruntled pout. It\u2019s clear he disagrees.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe I <em>would</em> agree with you,\u201d Aizawa says slowly. \u201cExcept I don\u2019t, because I have first hand evidence of what\u2019s happened to Touya at your father\u2019s hands. I cannot see behind closed doors and I am not going to willingly endanger a child. Is that clear?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fuyumi squirms uncomfortably but Todoroki finally nods. \u201cI agree.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo\u2019s shoulders slump with relief even as Fuyumi looks at her little brother in betrayal. Aizawa holds up a hand to stem all further arguments. \u201cBut, there\u2019s a more pressing reason. And I want all of you to listen very carefully to what I\u2019m about to say.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In that instant, it\u2019s possible to hear a pin drop. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe reason Touya was brought to me, brought to the custody of the police, was because he was being pursued by the hero Hawks prior to this quirk mishap.\u201d He lets that sink in for a moment; after all, the implications are clear. \u201cMost of us know Touya under a different name, namely the villain Dabi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki jerks in his seat. His head whips around to the room where his brother sleeps, jaw clenching. Fuyumi is muttering her disbelief under her breath while Natsuo\u2019s hands shake on his knees.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf <em>course</em> he is,\u201d Natsuo spits, shocking Aizawa somewhat. \u201cIt\u2019s...it would make sense. Why...why Dabi appeared after the Noumu had...It was <em>personal</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa nods. \u201cThat\u2019s what we think as well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not true!\u201d Fuyumi cries. \u201cTouya is...he\u2019s\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuyumi, where is Touya right now?\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice is calm, Fuyumi shattering. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know! He ran away,\u201d she insists, almost pleading to Aizawa. \u201cHe had an argument with Father and ran away but that\u2019s all! He never...he isn\u2019t...he isn\u2019t <em>that</em> man!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOur eyewitnesses say he is,\u201d Yamada cuts in, firmly but also gently. \u201cWe know this is hard for you all to understand but this is why we can\u2019t send Touya home. We don\u2019t know what Endeavour\u2019s reaction to him would be and we don\u2019t know how Touya would react to him should he change back. This quirk isn\u2019t permanent.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>More silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe hated Father.\u201d It\u2019s Natsuo, again, and Aizawa\u2019s starting to think he has the most sense out of all of them. \u201cTouya was...he was the one with the strongest quirk. Our father trained him every day for years, pushed him and pushed him.\u201d Natsuo\u2019s voice breaks but he continues. \u201cBut no matter what, Touya was never good enough. But he did everything he could. And then\u2026\u201d He sends an apologetic look sideways. \u201cThen Shouto was born and his quirk was perfect. It was everything our father wanted. And just like that, Touya was thrown away. I think\u2026\u201d He trails off but Aizawa nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe hated what he went through but being pushed aside hurt more.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo\u2019s head bows sadly. \u201cI think that\u2019s when he started to change. I...Father <em>broke</em> him. And...and we never tried to put the pieces back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were a <em>child</em>,\u201d Aizawa tells him severely. \u201cFixing him was <em>never</em> your job. I\u2019m sure you were busy with your own problems. What happened to Touya is between him and his father.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe missed Mother, after she went away,\u201d Fuyumi hesitantly adds, hands twisting together in her lap fretfully. \u201cHe would always check on her and take care of her. And she...I remember, sometimes, our mother would come visit him at night just to watch him sleep. I think she knew he was hurting but he never said. He never talked to us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Through all of this, Todoroki looks more and more uncomfortable. At Aizawa\u2019s piercing gaze, he looks away. \u201cI\u2026\u201d Todoroki shrugs. \u201cI was separated from my siblings. I don\u2019t know Touya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a loud <em>bang</em> from the kitchen as Yamada throws his chair back and storms away, bedroom door slamming behind him. Aizawa understands. He sets them all with a very serious stare. \u201cI hope you all know this going to come out in the wash. This behaviour is unacceptable of a hero.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For once, he only gets meek nods. Good. Maybe the horror of what their family life truly is is starting to sink in. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He gets up, gesturing to the door. \u201cNow, I think it\u2019s time you leave. According to information Hawks was able to find today, Touya will remain young one day for each year he now is. This is day two; we have three more.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill he keep his memories of...this?\u201d Fuyumi asks as she collects her bag.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa shakes his head. \u201cNo, he won\u2019t. But apparently his emotions do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo frowns. \u201cDoes that...So if we plant the right emotion in him now, when he\u2019s young, it might say him when he returns to...Dabi?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d is all Aizawa says. He doesn\u2019t make promises he can\u2019t keep.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki and Fuyumi leave, Natsuo waving them on before turning to Aizawa. \u201cI know you\u2019re Shouto\u2019s teacher so you have school tomorrow. I don\u2019t have any classes on Monday. I...I\u2019m going to have Touya for the day.\u201d He gains confidence somewhere along the line and it comes out as a fact more than a request. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother and despite what you said, I know I failed him. For one day, I want him to be <em>normal</em>. There\u2019s a winter festival on too; he deserves this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa mulls it over before eventually nodding. \u201cBut only because we know he\u2019ll remain his current age.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Natsuo says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He takes his leave then and Aizawa doesn\u2019t bother to wave, just slams the door shut. He needs to start getting paid for this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s barely past six the next morning when Natsuo arrives. Aizawa blearily lets him in, Natsuo wincing in sympathy at the coffee mug in his hand. Yamada is still asleep, as is Touya, and Natsuo seems to understand that. He keeps his voice down as he follows Aizawa to the kitchen before dumping a rather large bag on the dining table. He looks a little sheepish but still indicates for Aizawa to take it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI stopped by the shops on the way home last night,\u201d Natsuo explains as Aizawa finds himself looking at a variety of clothes and a couple of toys. \u201cI know it\u2019s only three more days but I don\u2019t want you to have to spend any money on my brother.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa murmurs out a thanks. So far they\u2019ve made do with an old shirt for sleeping and lost property items from the police station for during the day but yes, Touya could probably use something actually his size and something that doesn\u2019t have to be washed every night. The toys are useful too, small and unobtrusive and no loud sounds. Natsuo must have noticed their lack of age appropriate things yesterday.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI take it you can handle it from here?\u201d Aizawa asks as he hears Yamada get up in the other room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo nods resolutely and Aizawa leaves him to it. He passes over the spare apartment key, as well as his phone number. If anything goes wrong, he\u2019s to be called immediately. Natsuo assures him that\u2019s not going to happen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A good half an hour later, Aizawa and Yamada are gone and Natsuo is left alone in their apartment. He finds it a little unnerving but eventually decides to pop on the tv and check his university emails. He does that until tiny feet patter into the room. Turning around, he comes face to face with Touya. Touya stares at him for the longest moment before smiling. He trots over and giggles when he\u2019s lifted up, burrowing into Natsuo\u2019s chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Touya,\u201d Natsuo murmurs, squeezing him tightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya mumbles back a greeting of his own and then pushes himself away. It\u2019s still shocking to Natsuo just how <em>small</em> he is. Yes, he knew he\u2019d always been taller than Touya but seeing it from an adult perspective...he almost wonders if Touya is ill. He knows certain nutritional deficiencies and even stress can stunt a child\u2019s growth. Although Natsuo hates to admit it, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the latter is actually true. Touya\u2019s just so <em>tiny</em>, especially compared to the rest of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But that isn\u2019t here or there and there\u2019s nothing Natsuo can do about it now. No, instead he sets Touya down and brings over the bag. Touya looks stunned that all these things are for him and it pulls at Natsuo\u2019s heart. He watches as Touya goes from toy to toy, face lighting up at each one. What makes Natsuo laugh is Touya\u2019s utter fascination with a stuffed alpaca he\u2019d bought on a whim. The thing gets tucked under his arm and never leaves.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya eventually senses his gaze, shying away. \u201c...thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya\u2026\u201d Natsuo\u2019s heart breaks again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. Now come on, let\u2019s go explore!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya\u2019s head whips up and something in Natsuo\u2019s smile must be infectious because he mirrors it. Natsuo helps him into some clothes, so, so relieved when the shoes fit because he\u2019d <em>really</em> had to guess there and as much as he loves his brother, he doesn\u2019t think his arms could take carrying him all day. Touya\u2019s pride probably couldn\u2019t take it either. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Touya asks as they walk to the station, alpaca still under his arm - Natsuo hadn\u2019t been able to convince him to leave it at the apartment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo holds up a folder guiltily. \u201cI have to drop this assignment off at university but after that, there\u2019s a winter festival on a few suburbs over. I thought we could go there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya nods excitedly, Natsuo fumbling at the station when he realises he has to buy Touya a train pass before leading him to the platform. It\u2019s busy but not too crowded. It\u2019s enough so though that Touya presses to his side and fists a hand in his jacket. Natsuo keeps a firm hand on his back as well, just in case. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The trip to his campus is almost instinctual at this point and Natsuo makes his way to his professor\u2019s office, Touya on his heels. He\u2019d admittedly forgotten to hand this assignment in but hopefully he\u2019ll make a good enough impression that he won\u2019t be marked down. If nothing else, he can surely play up the High End incident for some sympathy votes in his corner. He raps on the door and is called in. He hesitates before bringing Touya in too. It may not be allowed but Natsuo isn\u2019t going to leave him alone. Professor Tanaka raises an eyebrow. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs this a university or a kindergarten Mr. Todoroki?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya bows deeply before Natsuo can speak. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir. I was hit by a quirk and Natsuo...my big brother is taking care of me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Professor Tanaka looks a tad taken aback. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not your fault. Please sit, I need to speak with your brother.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He indicates a chair in the corner of the room and Touya sits in it. Natsuo passes over his phone and opens it to a simple game app, turning the volume all the way down. With Touya taken care of, he hands over his assignment and discovers, to his surprise, that his \u201cpersonal circumstances\u201d - i.e. High End - have been taken up with the university board and if he\u2019d like to take a semester off, they\u2019ll allow it. Natsuo quickly shoots it down though, apologising for this assignments tardiness but assuring him it will be the first and <em>only</em> one. Professor Tanaka hums but takes his word for it, giving him the syllabus for the next unit and pointing out some key areas. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Natsuo knows it, nearly an hour has passed. He looks apologetically at Touya upon realising but he is still diligently sitting, phone now discarded but swinging his legs contentedly enough, hands folded in his lap. Professor Tanaka cracks a smile. \u201cYour brother is impeccably well behaved.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo tries not to cringe. \u201cHe is. Touya\u2019s a wonderful brother.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The boy\u2019s ears burn red but Professor Tanaka waves him over. The teacher takes the lid off a jar that looks like a plant and offers Touya what Natsuo sees are lollies. Touya eyes him up before taking a step back, head shaking. \u201cNatsuo did the schoolwork,\u201d he offers as explanation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm, but he handed it in late.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya still refuses. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI just sat down.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Professor Tanaka frowns and Natsuo very much avoids eye contact. It gets him a sigh. \u201cWell, how about you both have one?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That, it seems, is enough to win Touya over. He finally takes one of the wrapped sweets, passing it to Natsuo before taking his own. Natsuo awkwardly waves goodbye and they head back to the station, this time bound for the festival. His lolly is popped in his mouth before he realises Touya\u2019s is still clenched in his fist.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want me to open it for you?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Touya repeats and it suddenly hits Natsuo that this may be the first time Touya has ever been praised. His eyes tear up and his fists clench. Before he can think twice, his hands are grabbing Touya\u2019s shoulders and he\u2019s forcing their eyes to meet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got this because you did everything <em>right</em>. You could have left, could have asked to go outside, could have spoken the whole time, could have complained but you didn\u2019t. You were <em>good</em> Touya.\u201d Natsuo grabs his hand. \u201cThis is a <em>reward</em> Touya; a reward for doing something good. My teacher and I were both proud of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya blinks at him in incomprehension. Natsuo doubts their father\u2019s ever told Touya he was proud of him. Touya frowns at the lolly. \u201cI...I wasn\u2019t a failure?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo\u2019s jaw clenches. \u201cYou never were and you never will be, do you understand?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut my quirk is-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about your quirk!\u201d Natsuo shouts, Touya jumping. \u201cThis is about <em>you</em> Touya, about who you are. <em>You</em> are a good person. You are not a failure. Do you understand?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He says it so firmly this time, it\u2019s almost a demand. Still, Touya finally nods. Natsuo nods back, hefting him up and setting him on his hip. Touya doesn\u2019t protest, just snuggles into his neck. A few streets later though,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The festival, Natsuo finds, is much better. Touya is enthralled by the colourful stalls and the aromas of various foods. His eyes are wide with wonder and Natsuo hesitates before snapping a few photos on his phone. It\u2019s his brother. He\u2019s allowed to do that, right? </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They share a plate of takoyaki and Natsuo shouts Touya a taiyaki. They try their hand at goldfish scooping and while Natsuo is utterly hopeless, Touya does surprisingly well. He\u2019s quick to hand the goldfish back though, explaining they don\u2019t have anywhere to keep them. They purchase a pair of kitsune masks and Natsuo helps Touya arrange his in his hair before scooping him up. The stalls are busier now and Touya\u2019s steps are slowing. Natsuo isn\u2019t surprised; they\u2019ve been out for hours.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNatsuo?\u201d Touya murmurs, hands fiddling with Natsuo\u2019s collar. \u201cThank you for bringing me here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo smiles, leaning down to press their foreheads together and then brushing their noses. Touya giggles, squealing when Natsuo kisses his cheek. \u201cI love you Touya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya squeaks and hides in his neck and Natsuo goes to tease him again when he hears the voice that makes them both freeze.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Natsuo</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya fiercely scrabbles in his arms but Natsuo pins him to his chest, forcefully keeping his head turned away. He\u2019s going to keep Touya as far away from this conversation as possible. If he has his way, their father is never going to recognise Touya. Natsuo tucks the boy into his shoulder and rounds on Endeavour. He\u2019s in his hero outfit and, right, Natsuo should have expected that. An event like this, of course there would be heightened hero surveillance. His father barely spares him a look though, eyes raking over the boy in his arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he demands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo\u2019s teeth grind. \u201cIt\u2019s a child,\u201d he spits back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhose?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That takes him a little aback but then Natsuo realises it <em>could</em> be possible for Touya to be his. Yes, he\u2019d have to have been young but hey, Natsuo never claims to have been a saint. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d is what he says instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour marches closer, Touya flinching at the heat that comes with him. \u201c<em>Natsuo</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Natsuo\u2019 me Father. I\u2019m here to enjoy myself and how I choose to do so isn\u2019t any of your business.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He sees the instant his father snaps, the venom spewing behind his tongue but before Endeavour can start to yell, Touya wrenches himself free and finally faces him. \u201cStop!\u201d he cries.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour blinks, hand pausing before his eyes narrow. \u201cYou.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya shrinks down, Natsuo pulling him back. But when Endeavour makes to grab him, everything comes to a head. Touya claws his way out of Natsuo\u2019s grip, somehow managing to push him aside for all that he\u2019s five-years-old and then activating his own quirk. Flames erupt between them and the crowd around them start screaming. Natsuo yanks Touya to his chest, hissing at him to stop while Endeavour calms the crowd by, apparently, shouting at them. Touya\u2019s flames splutter and die out as his tears start but Natsuo doesn\u2019t even get a chance to talk to him before they\u2019re being marched away. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Natsuo demands but their father just scoffs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe can\u2019t control his quirk. He needs to be isolated.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s <em>five</em>!\u201d Natsuo counters, for all the good it does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for him! Shouto was never so useless.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya whimpers and if Natsuo could weasel himself free, he would. But he can\u2019t, not without making a scene. Eventually they reach a demountable. It\u2019s been set up for the heroes for when they\u2019re on break, Natsuo realises. He\u2019s mercilessly shoved inside, stumbling a little and making Touya cling to him tighter. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow long has this-\u201d Endeavour gestures loosely at Touya, \u201c-been a thing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>To be smart, Natsuo shoots back, \u201cTwenty-four years.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His father is less than impressed. \u201cAs his father, I should have been the first one informed. Where is he being kept?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you were a decent father maybe you would have been,\u201d Natsuo says coldly. \u201cBut apparently Touya dobbed on you and so now no one in their right mind is letting you anywhere <em>near</em> him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour\u2019s eyes narrow. Maybe Natsuo should have kept that to himself. Touya shrinks down further. \u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d he insists, shaking his head in fear. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything! I told them it was training!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo hisses. He glares at his father. \u201cHow dare you make him say that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t make him say anything,\u201d is the retort but Natsuo isn\u2019t standing for it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did, you just don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d He meets Endeavour\u2019s gaze. \u201cI will never tell you where Touya is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seems redundant because Touya is <em>right there</em> but Endeavour sees the second layer; Natsuo knows where Touya is at his current age. There\u2019s a sense of inarticulate rage and some part of Natsuo fills with pride, knowing he\u2019s pissed his father off this much. It says a very specific something when he isn\u2019t even surprised when a backhanded slap comes his way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What does surprise him though is that it never makes contact. Once more, his brother is there. Touya\u2019s flames are so much hotter than Natsuo remembers and there\u2019s something in his eyes he\u2019s never seen before, something that makes him very much realise: yes, his brother can kill. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour\u2019s throwing up a wall of flames himself even as Natsuo is wrapping himself around Touya. He can\u2019t create ice like Shouto can but he can lower the temperature of things he touches. And so he bundles Touya up and lowers his temperature down, down, down, until his quirk fizzles out and he wracks with cold. Natsuo whispers apologies into his ear even as Touya glares at their father. The flame hero glares back. Before they can inevitably be punished though, a call comes through on Endeavour\u2019s walkie talkie. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Suspicious activity on the left hand perimeter. All heroes report.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour points a finger at them. \u201cStay here,\u201d he orders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Needless to say, the second he leaves, Natsuo takes Touya and runs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa walks up to his apartment with dread clawing at his throat. Hawks is on his heels and that, he thinks, says enough. While he\u2019d given Natsuo his number, he never thought he\u2019d actually use it. But he had and Aizawa is now having to skip out early from his classes to deal with the aftermath of what sounds like a horrible day. Hawks has been sent along at Tsukauchi\u2019s request and Aizawa really doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s helping or hindering. For one, he can\u2019t be quiet for more than a minute. Is sixty seconds really <em>that</em> long?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pushing open the apartment door, Aizawa will admit though that this is beyond what he imagined. Because there is Touya, standing on the back of the couch so he\u2019s eye height with Natsuo and downright <em>screaming</em> at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya, <em>please</em>,\u201d Natsuo is trying but Touya just lets out a wordless shout.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>No!</em>\u201d he screams when Natsuo attempts to take his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me! I\u2019m going to kill him! I\u2019m going to kill him!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flames lash out then and Aizawa\u2019s quirk is activating before he knows it. His capture weapon whips out too. \u201c<em>Stand down Dabi.</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silence fills the room and Aizawa realises he\u2019s gone overboard, momentarily forgotten just how old Touya is, but it doesn\u2019t matter because Touya simply sobs. His shoulders slump and he sobs and sobs. Natsuo goes to pick him up but Touya jerks away. Aizawa lets his capture weapon drop, carefully approaching.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAttacking\u201d him seems to have undone everything because Touya looks at him with hurt eyes before sprinting past. Natsuo shouts in alarm and Aizawa whirls around, thinking he\u2019s gone for the front door but no, Touya has flung himself into Hawks\u2019 legs, wailing until Hawks crouches down and awkwardly pats his back. \u201cUh...it\u2019s fine kid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo it\u2019s not!\u201d Touya cries, balled fists thumping against Hawks\u2019 chest. \u201cHe tried to hit Natsuo and...and...Father can\u2019t...he\u2019s only allowed to hit <em>me!</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks chokes on his inhale, swearing before his wings subconsciously come to wrap around Touya, pulling him in close. Aizawa\u2019s jaw clenches so hard his teeth grind. He gives Hawks a look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTake him and go. I need to talk with Natsuo. <em>Alone</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks won\u2019t lie; he isn\u2019t comfortable. Not in any way, shape, or form. Aizawa has essentially kicked him out of his apartment and left him with a disgruntled five-year-old. Hawks is...not a kid person. Yes, he can wave at them on the street, pose for pictures, and give autographs, but he can\u2019t interact with them for extended periods of time. He isn\u2019t <em>that</em> kind of person.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Apparently though, he has to be because Touya is still sniffling and if Hawks returns the kid even <em>more</em> upset, Aizawa will most likely skin him. Call him vain, but Hawks rather likes his skin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so he looks around and spots a small park down from Aizawa\u2019s apartment block. He takes Touya\u2019s hand and gives it an experimental tug. Touya doesn\u2019t even try to fight, just blindly lets himself be pulled along. It causes Hawks to stumble because he\u2019d been expecting resistance of some sort. After all, this is Dabi. But it clearly isn\u2019t because <em>Touya</em> is meek and quiet and lets Hawks manhandle him to the top of the jungle gym. Hawks sits next to him, an arm awkwardly wrapped around Touya\u2019s shoulders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seems like a stupid thing to ask but again, Hawks is out of his depths here. Touya, bless him, simply wipes his nose and nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou sure? It\u2019s okay not to be.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo it\u2019s not,\u201d Touya mumbles, curling further into himself and Hawks\u2019 heart aches. How could Endeavour to this to anyone, let alone his own <em>child</em>?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay when you\u2019re with me, how about that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya blinks up at him once, twice, and then bursts into tears. Hawks swears, waving his hands madly but Touya stops him by wrapping his arms around his waist. \u201cI wanna go home!\u201d he wails. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay and I want to go home!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBuddy\u2026\u201d Hawks sighs. \u201cTrust me, I would if I could.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But really no, he wouldn\u2019t. He knows what awaits Touya when he returns to his warped version of \u201cnormal\u201d. Touya sniffles a few more times, tucking himself into Hawks\u2019 chest. \u201cYou...your name is Hawks, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep,\u201d he confirms, shifting his wings out to their full wingspan, hinting at the name\u2019s origin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya stares in wonder before dropping his gaze. \u201cDo you work with my father?\u201d A nod, to which Touya cringes. \u201cDo you...like him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks mulls on that. \u201c...I\u2019m starting not to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya\u2019s head whips up, frowning. \u201cWhy? He\u2019s really strong!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd?\u201d Hawks asks, shrugging. \u201cLots of people are strong Dabi. But being a hero isn\u2019t about being strong. It\u2019s about saving people. Helping them. And I think,\u201d he adds, more to himself than the boy in front of him, \u201cthat you can\u2019t do the things Endeavour does and claim to be a hero.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks is expecting maybe a \u2018thank you\u2019, possibly a lecture - with kids you can never tell - but what he isn\u2019t expecting is for Touya to bluntly demand, \u201cWho\u2019s Dabi?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks must be a terrible double agent - he wonders how he fooled Dabi at all - because he jerks back far too quickly to be anything natural. He gives an awkward chuckle, scratching at his cheek. \u201cDabi? Never heard that name...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya looks less than impressed, folding his arms sternly. \u201cYou just called me it.\u201d And shit, he did. \u201cAnd so did Aizawa. My name is Touya!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pouts and Hawks can\u2019t help but laugh, ruffling his hair. It also gives him time to come up with an explanation. \u201cAh, Dabi is another guy we know. Kind of looks like you and has a fire quirk too, only, uh, his hair is black.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019ll work, right? This kid\u2019s only five. They fall for things like that, don\u2019t they?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs he angry?\u201d Touya asks. \u201cBecause Aizawa called that when I was being mad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, a little. But, deep down, I think he\u2019s more hurt than anything. And so,\u201d Hawks says, meeting Touya\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cI want to help him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s never been brave enough to say it to his face but he\u2019s brave enough now. There\u2019s always been something about Dabi that rubbed Hawks the wrong way. He thinks now he knows what it is. That unsaid, unconscious cry for help. As though inside, all this time, Dabi has been screaming.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They sit in silence for awhile before Touya rocks forward. \u201cWe should go,\u201d he offers as an explanation. \u201cThe sun is starting to go down. You always have to be home by dark.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Hawks agrees, jumping a little when Touya\u2019s hand slides into his. He quickly grips back though, leading the way home.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHawks,\u201d Touya says as they approach the door. \u201cIf you see Dabi again, can you tell him I hope he feels better soon?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks goes to nod before an idea pops into his head. He pulls out his phone, crouching down to Touya\u2019s level and opening the camera, swapping it to video mode. \u201cHere; tell him yourself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa\u2019s conversation with Natsuo goes about as well as he\u2019d predicted. Natsuo, unlike Fuyumi, has absolutely no intentions of covering for his father and was more than happy to repeat the events of that day to a recorder. He\u2019d also gone back as far as he could remember at Aizawa\u2019s suggestion and his list was long and detailed. Aizawa\u2019s learnt more about Todoroki Enji in one afternoon than he ever wanted to. Also, he\u2019s starting to find himself wishing that that Noumu had taken him out. He\u2019s starting to think it\u2019s a shame Miruko interrupted Dabi.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa then shakes those thoughts away. Those are the sorts of thoughts that lead to vigilante justice and threaten the tenuous hold heroes have on society. He can\u2019t afford to start greying the waters. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks brings Touya back seconds behind Yamada arriving. While Yamada greets Touya, Hawks pulls Aizawa aside and Aizawa cringes when he hears the slip up they\u2019ve both made. Luckily Hawks\u2019 cover is good enough to protect them. He thanks the other hero for the heads up and gets a two-fingered salute in response. Hawks goes to leave then but Touya catches the movement, flinging himself out of Yamada\u2019s arms to grasp his shoulder. There\u2019s shouting as both heroes nearly drop the boy but eventually Touya is bundled up in Hawks\u2019 arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat kid?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya doesn\u2019t say anything, just fists his hands in Hawks\u2019 jacket and hides his face. Aizawa sighs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya, Hawks has to go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWant him to stay,\u201d is the despondent mumble, Hawks flushing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa lays a hand on Touya\u2019s back, trying to ignore the way he flinches. \u201cHawks has patrol.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya reluctantly lifts his head. \u201cHawks has hero work?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hawks says, offering a \u2018what-can-you-do\u2019 smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya accepts that, sliding to the floor and shuffling his way to Aizawa\u2019s side. He won\u2019t look at any of them though and Aizawa knows he\u2019s fighting back tears. He rubs the boy\u2019s back soothingly, running a few calculations before pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cAre you working tomorrow Hawks?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks frowns. \u201cNo, I-...No. No, no, no!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa just grins. \u201cPerfect. I think it\u2019s your turn with Touya. I\u2019ll have him at your apartment by 7.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am not a single dad and you\u2019re not my wife!\u201d Hawks cries, stomping a foot petulantly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a custody battle!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, but Touya seems to like you. Plus, you\u2019re young.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks squints at him. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>five</em>. But fine!\u201d he sighs, hands flinging into the air dramatically. \u201cI\u2019ll take my turn.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With that, he turns and storms out. Touya cringes when the door slams. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that. Now he\u2019s mad. I can look after myself, I promise! I don\u2019t want to make Hawks angry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa should have seen that coming. Luckily, Yamada\u2019s onto it. \u201cHe\u2019s not mad, little listener. He just likes to make a fuss. He\u2019s all squawk and no bite.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya giggles. \u201cThat\u2019s because birds don\u2019t have teeth!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yamada taps his chin in thought theatrically. \u201cDo you think Hawks has teeth?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa sees the moment Touya\u2019s mind screeches to a halt. It looks like all systems have gone offline as he struggles over this problem. \u201cYou can ask him tomorrow,\u201d Aizawa cuts in before the boy has a full existential crisis. Instead, he shifts down, taking Touya\u2019s shoulders into his. \u201cFor now, I need to tell you I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya cocks his head to the side in confusion. \u201cFor what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa can\u2019t believe he even as to answer that; it should be obvious. \u201cFirst of all, for shouting at you. Secondly, for using my quirk on you without permission. And thirdly, for ensnaring you with this.\u201d He holds up his capture weapon.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya just shakes his head. \u201cNo, it was my fault. I was shouting. And I...I used my quirk. I\u2019m not allowed to.\u201d He chews his bottom lip before straightening, eyes hard when they lock with Aizawa\u2019s. \u201cYou can punish me; it\u2019s okay. I deserve it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa doesn\u2019t think, just crushes the boy in his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t you <em>ever</em> say that!\u201d he growls, hands shaking even as they hug Touya fiercely. \u201cYou are a <em>child</em>! You make mistakes and you have emotions. You did nothing wrong. <em>I</em> did. I am the adult here; I know how to behave and I didn\u2019t.\u201d He holds Touya at arm\u2019s length. \u201cTodoroki Touya, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya breaks down there and for the first time, Aizawa thinks it\u2019s for the right reasons.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya arrives at Hawks\u2019 door bang on seven and quite snappily dressed for a glorified toddler. It\u2019s cute and all but Hawks has been held up at work and didn\u2019t get home until three. He can\u2019t deal with this. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He nods at Yamada and drags Touya into the apartment. He helps him out of his shoes and then hauls him to his bedroom, flopping down and spreading a wing over his charge. This way, he\u2019ll know if he moves, even in his sleep. Touya stares at him with wide eyes, confused more than scared.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHawks?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He groans. \u201cSorry kid but I\u2019m wiped. Can you sleep?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can try?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks pats his back in thanks and lets his eyes fall shut. He knows he\u2019s being unfair but he just can\u2019t right now, he physically <em>can\u2019t</em>. And if Touya is well behaved enough to not disturb him? Hawks is going to shamelessly take advantage of that. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It works too because the next thing Hawks knows, he\u2019s being awoken by his phone ringing and a quick glance at it tells him it\u2019s passed eleven. His eyes fly - fly, ha ha - to Touya but he is actually asleep, a fistful of feathers in his tiny hand. Hawks can\u2019t help but smile even as he answers his phone, though he balks at the caller ID somewhat: </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>All Might</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello?\u201d he answers with a frown.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cUh...Hawks. Yes, it\u2019s me. I, uh-\u201c</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For someone that was so confident as All Might, Toshinori...isn\u2019t. Hawks groans, running a hand through his hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToshinori, what d\u2019ya need?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201c...for you to let me in?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A beat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya is jerked out of sleep but he isn\u2019t given room to think, Hawks scooping him up as he bolts for his front door. He\u2019s confident the boy\u2019s still mostly asleep when he comes face to face with the once Symbol of Peace. Hawks stares at him dumbly for the longest time before blankly stepping out of the doorway. Toshinori apologises as he enters, shaking his phone as he does so.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDetective Naomasa <em>did</em> message you. I, uh...in light of yesterday\u2019s events, Touya is always to be in the company of two people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It makes sense but Hawks still isn\u2019t impressed. He just wanted a day off. \u201cYeah, I was asleep,\u201d he replies offhandedly. \u201cBut come in, make yourself at home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not that he has much of a \u2018home\u2019. It\u2019s a small apartment and it hasn\u2019t been cleaned in the better part of two weeks. His gaming console has wires trailing all over the living room and there are piles of...god, he doesn\u2019t even <em>know</em>, everywhere. Hawks gives Toshinori an awkward grin and, to his relief, Toshinori returns it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d he adds in a hushed whisper, relieving Hawks of Touya. \u201cI\u2019ll mind him, if you\u2019d like some time to wake up proper.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks nods wearily, sends Touya a reassuring smile when he looks uncertain, then lumbers back to his bedroom. He has what as to be the fastest shower ever, changes into something slightly presentable, and returns to the main room to start on lunch. His stomach is growling and Touya\u2019s is probably too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid he sleep with you?\u201d Toshinori asks as he fumbles with the tv, Touya jabbing buttons on the game controller. \u201cHe\u2019ll be up all night.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood,\u201d Hawks replies and he means it. He flicks the tv on with a feather, ignoring Toshinori\u2019s embarrassed spluttering. \u201cDabs, Mario\u2019s already in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The second the words are out of his mouth, ice pours through his veins. He doesn\u2019t need Toshinori to know he sucks Dabi\u2019s dick on the reg\u2019 and certainly doesn\u2019t need him to know that said villain has come to his apartment and they\u2019ve actually hung out, like friends. The last thing Hawks needs is for Toshinori to know he has given Dabi an <em>affectionate nickname</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDabs?\u201d Toshinori repeats, frowning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s someone Hawks knows,\u201d Touya pipes up, loading the game with ease and clambering onto the couch. \u201cHe\u2019s angry and needs help. Sometimes I get angry too,\u201d he tacks on, blinking up at Toshinori innocently. \u201cHave you ever got angry?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That, luckily, is apparently enough to distract Toshinori, Hawks letting out a <em>whoosh</em> of air. He slaps lunch together and goes to join them on the couch when Touya cuts Toshinori off and he does so brilliantly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks freezes in place while Toshinori\u2019s jaw drops open. Touya has the decency to blush and he squirms uncomfortably but he doesn\u2019t take it back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave I done something to upset you?\u201d Toshinori pries gently.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya frowns, forehead scrunching together. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know,\u201d he admits, a hand clutching at his chest. \u201cBut I...in here, I don\u2019t like you. Are we...when I\u2019m big, are we friends?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori hesitates before his shoulders drop. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMust be why,\u201d Touya chirps, grinning again. He waves at Hawks, the hero feeling dread all over again. \u201cHawks is my friend. When I\u2019m big! I know because he makes me happy!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh uh,\u201d Hawks cuts in before Toshinori can look suspicious. \u201cGood thinking kid, but you like Aizawa too and, sorry to say, you\u2019re not friends right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya pauses. \u201cOh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting theory though,\u201d Toshinori muses, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \u201cSome part of Touya\u2019s memories must hang on. Or, his emotional connections at least.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Hawks says in a tone he hopes is doubtful. \u201cIf so, it\u2019s got a few loose connections.\u201d It doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s terrifying. He plops down next to Touya, hoisting him into his lap. \u201cBut you\u2019re my friend now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya nods excitedly, taking a piece of his toast and munching away happily enough. It\u2019s endearing but Hawks has to look away. He can\u2019t put endearing with Dabi. He doesn\u2019t want to imagine Dabi as this...this child. That\u2019s a turn-off if ever he\u2019s seen one. He prefers his men older, thank you very much.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before he can get trapped in his head, Hawks passes a second controller to Toshinori. \u201cWanna play?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI...Oh, well, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToshinori, he\u2019s <em>five</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s something challenging in the way Hawks says it and Toshinori seems to pick up on it. His expression instantly changes and Hawks chuckles under his breath. \u201cTake it away Touya!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time Hawks returns Touya to Aizawa, it\u2019s fast approaching midnight. The kid is asleep, head resting on his shoulder and arms wrapped round the base of his wings. Aizawa looks mildly disgruntled at the late hour but doesn\u2019t say anything, just lets Hawks put Touya into bed, clothes and all. Touya stirs ever so slightly but is soon fast asleep.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEndeavour didn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease. He wouldn\u2019t trust me with a kid as far as I could throw one. I was probably the <em>last</em> guy on his radar.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks hears the tension there, matching it when he turns around. \u201cAizawa, this is all going to go to shit tomorrow.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cThen make sure it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks snorts. \u201cNot my job. Take it up with the Todorokis.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s Aizawa\u2019s turn to snort. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him anywhere near them. Well, some of them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, so...what do we do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa is silent. And somehow, that\u2019s worse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cAh, Tsukauchi, thank you for picking up...yes, I know it\u2019s late...I </span></em>will<em> sleep, I just...the security footage Hawks found regarding when he found Dabi, do you have it?...No, I didn\u2019t think so...Yes, put Sansa onto it. I think we\u2019re missing something.\u201d\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa wakes up on the dawn of D-Day with trepidation already filling his bones. Yesterday went well, he knows that, and he knows that Touya is probably going to wake up in the best mood he\u2019s been in since this whole debacle started but none of that matters because it\u2019s all going to end the same way:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki Touya turning back into Dabi.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And that in itself is going to have horrible consequences. Even if Aizawa knows what Todoroki Enji has done to Touya, it doesn\u2019t excuse everything. Hell, it doesn\u2019t excuse <em>ninety-percent</em> of it. There\u2019s then the fact that Touya - or Dabi, he supposes - won\u2019t remember any of this and will attack them on sight. Aizawa doesn\u2019t blame him. If their situations were reversed, he\u2019d do the same. Actually, he\u2019ll probably end up doing so anyway because he\u2019ll need to shut Dabi down the second he turns back. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which is probably why Aizawa messages Naomasa and tells him he\u2019ll be in later with Touya; best to have him turn back at the station then try to wrestle him there and potentially lose him. He also contacts Nedzu but the principal has long since been made aware and has relieved not only him, but Yamada and Toshinori as well. Apparently this is a all-hands-on-deck scenario. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sighing, Aizawa flops onto the couch, head lolling over the back. He\u2019s ready for bed already.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t get the chance though, not when footsteps stop just shy of the couch. \u201cMorning Touya,\u201d he greets lazily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi,\u201d Touya whispers, skirting around him and settling in on the floor with a colouring book Natsuo had bought him. His alpaca is, once again, stuffed under his arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou ready for today?\u201d Aizawa asks, swearing when he\u2019s met with confusion and right - they hadn\u2019t told the kid.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa can\u2019t lie; it wouldn\u2019t help any of them. He nudges Touya\u2019s knee with his foot. \u201cThis quirk wears off today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cI...I\u2019m going to be a big boy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa huffs unbidden. \u201cYeah, you are.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya looks disgustingly proud, smiling the widest perhaps Aizawa has seen. He manages a fake one in return but it\u2019s enough, Touya returning to his colouring. Yamada takes that as his moment to arrive, still in his pyjamas and hair pulled into a loose braid, strands having escaped sometime during the night and flying every which way. Aizawa accepts the kiss to the cheek before going to start breakfast. Yamada flops down beside Touya and reaches up to ruffle his hair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss ya kid,\u201d he murmurs. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya shoves him off. \u201cWell I won\u2019t,\u201d he sniffs. \u201c<em>I</em> get to go home. <em>I</em> get to see Mother!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yamada freezes there, Aizawa\u2019s eyes closing in despair because that isn\u2019t...that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to happen. It isn\u2019t anywhere <em>close</em>. Today will end with Touya in a jail cell. Yamada just lets his hand drop, staring at the ceiling resolutely. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not long after Aizawa calls them to breakfast. And as Touya happily munches away, eating foods Aizawa now knows are his favourites, Aizawa only feels worse and worse. He\u2019s leading a lamb to the slaughter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And, worst of all, he\u2019s supposed to be okay with it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They arrive at the station just after midday. Toshinori is already there, having been in meetings with Naomasa all morning. Aizawa doesn\u2019t know what the pair talk about, but he knows they\u2019re often together. There\u2019s things they know that he doesn\u2019t and, as time progresses, Aizawa is starting to think more and more that one of those things involves Midoriya. He doesn\u2019t have any proof, but he\u2019s going to get answers sooner or later.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Who is, however, most notably missing is any member of the Todoroki clan. Naomasa must see the question on his face, smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNatsuo will be here within the hour, Fuyumi a little afterwards. There should be time, before the quirk wears off.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya bounces on his toes excitedly, all too happy when Naomasa asks if he would like to say hello to Sansa again. The officer is standing only a few feet away but just enough so, Aizawa notices, to be out of earshot. Ah. So there\u2019s something there. Something regarding Touya that Naomasa doesn\u2019t want him to hear. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to guess what that something might entail. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen you say before the quirk wears off, how do you know?\u201d Yamada asks before Aizawa can get a word in. \u201cEven if it\u2019s an exact thing, we don\u2019t know when Dabi was hit, only when Hawks found him.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori shifts there, Aizawa\u2019s eyes narrowing. \u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori jumps, hands wringing together but it\u2019s Naomasa who saves him, placing a hand on those trembling ones and shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t. It\u2019s thanks to Toshinori we have this lead at all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa frowns as Naomasa passes his phone over, a video playing on the screen. \u201cThis is the security footage of when Dabi was\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t say \u2018attacked\u2019 because it doesn\u2019t fit, just shrugs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is the <em>recovered</em> footage,\u201d Naomasa corrects, Aizawa locking up while Yamada bunches in closer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomeone got something to hide?\u201d Yamada questions aloud, squinting the same moment Aizawa nearly drops the device.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because he <em>can\u2019t</em> hide. There\u2019s no way to, not with his quirk\u2019s mutation being what it is. And so, very obviously, there is Hawks, striding along at Dabi\u2019s side as though he belongs there, grinning up at the villain and getting an exasperated look in return. Aizawa\u2019s hands shake in fury as Hawks\u2019 hand slides into Dabi\u2019s, smile just as wide but softer somehow. He has to hand the phone back entirely when Dabi backs him into a wall and kisses him soundly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShouta\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa brushes his husband\u2019s arm off his shoulder, teeth grinding. \u201cSo <em>this</em> is how High End came about.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d Naomasa cuts in, gently but firmly. \u201cIf you\u2019ll recall, Hawks looked just as surprised as us to find out Dabi was actually Todoroki Touya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe idolises Endeavour,\u201d Yamada says, tapping his chin thoughtfully. \u201cThe revelation probably threw him; knowing Endeavour did...that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the facts,\u201d Aizawa counters stonily. \u201cWe now know which side he\u2019s on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A hand curls around his, Aizawa snarling, already knowing who it is. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t,\u201d Toshinori whispers. \u201cI made some calls, used my position. The commission was very...unforthcoming regarding this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou think it\u2019s a job,\u201d Yamada surmises.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori nods. \u201cI think...Hawks is in a delicate situation right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa snorts. \u201cCommission or not, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gone above and beyond in some aspects.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t need to specify which areas and Toshinori goes red to the tips of his ears. Naomasa also coughs awkwardly while Yamada simply looks ill. They don\u2019t get to dwell on it though - although it <em>does</em> explain Hawks\u2019 absence - because at that moment the doors to the police station open. The doors opening isn\u2019t what gets their attention, but rather the heat wave that follows it and Aizawa already knows that what means, eyes flying to Touya. Touya, to his credit, already knows as well. He swallows thickly and gets to his feet, head bowed. It\u2019s a submissive pose if Aizawa has ever seen one. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa understands but that doesn\u2019t make it okay, taking two steps closer to the boy even as Endeavour glares at him. Aizawa wonders how he even found them. Who did he pressure? Who finally caved?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, Enji!\u201d Toshinori greets grandly and Aizawa is, for once, grateful for his overzealousness. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>You, quiet.</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The tone is deathly cold and Aizawa does a double take as Toshinori pales. He pulls himself back up seconds later but it\u2019s already too late, he\u2019s already shown that fatal weakness. Endeavour eyes them all up as though they\u2019re nothing more than minor inconveniences.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll be taking my son.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a statement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t allow that,\u201d Naomasa intervenes. \u201cTouya is currently part of a police investigation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs he facing charges?\u201d Endeavour sneers, knowing the answer. He nods when Naomasa doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cThen he comes with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEnji,\u201d Toshinori tries again and Aizawa has to admit, credit where credit\u2019s due. \u201cThis is a...delicate time. This quirk will wear off soon and it would be safer for Touya to be here when it happened than-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Toshinori</em>.\u201d Said man\u2019s jaw snaps shut. \u201cAre you insinuating I can\u2019t control my own child?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unfortunately, it\u2019s the exact opposite. He <em>can</em> control Touya and that, ironically, is what they\u2019re all trying to prevent. Because they\u2019ve seen Endeavour\u2019s method of \u2018control\u2019 and <em>no one</em> deserves to go through that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa\u2019s tempted to let Endeavour take him purely so Touya can light him on fire sometime very soon but he\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s frowned upon. Also, it creates all sorts of hassles on their end, especially considering none of them have actually filed that they have an <em>actual live villain</em> in their midst that they\u2019re all protecting and, even worse, sending on outings. Aizawa doubts the press would be impressed to discover they\u2019d had a villain in custody for five days and they let him play video games and go for ice-cream. And so, he has to step in. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNaomasa has already said no,\u201d he drawls. \u201cAs a police officer, his jurisdiction goes above yours.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it does, in the law system. However, Endeavour seems to know the system as well as Aizawa does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen acting as a hero, yes,\u201d Endeavour says all too smugly. \u201cAs a father, no. Touya, <em>now</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before any of them can push back, Aizawa feels a hand grasp his own momentarily. The next second Touya is at Endeavour\u2019s side, turning to them and bowing shortly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, for the trouble I\u2019ve caused.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs you should be,\u201d Endeavour snaps down at him, Touya flinching. His hand, when it lands on his son\u2019s shoulders, looks near painful. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...yes sir.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Toshinori makes an aborted motion but he doesn\u2019t have to finish it because as Endeavour has contacts, clearly Hawks does too. Aizawa feels his emotions conflict at the sight of the winged hero but he barely spares them a glance, feigning obliviousness as he bumps into Endeavour and then smiles widely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, hey, imagine seeing you here!\u201d he crows, arms spreading wide. \u201cAnd who\u2019s this? You never said you had a kid smaller than Shouto!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI <em>don\u2019t</em>,\u201d Endeavour grinds out, trying to push past only to fail. \u201cThis is my eldest.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks looks at Endeavour like he\u2019s an idiot. \u201cUh...kinda short, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bets are off, Aizawa likes him again. Touya giggles and Hawks flinches when Endeavour\u2019s fingers dig into his shoulder sharply, warning clear. \u201cThis is a quirk, obviously. I\u2019m taking him home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh cool,\u201d Hawks sings, falling in step like it\u2019s second nature. \u201cI\u2019ll come with! You never talk about your family. Now I get to see it in person.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour glares at him but Hawks just smiles back serenely. \u201c<em>You</em> are not invited,\u201d Endeavour spits.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d Hawks whines, and they\u2019re dangerously close to leaving the station now. Realistically, letting Touya go so long as Hawks is by his side is better than letting him leave alone but it\u2019s far from ideal. Because, again, they might not get Dabi back, not if Hawks turns a blind eye. \u201cBesides, can\u2019t see you as a kid person anyway. And he\u2019s, what, three?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m five!\u201d Touya protests and it\u2019s innocent enough but it creates the crack; one pressure too many. Endeavour backhands him and Aizawa can tell it\u2019s a warning - and isn\u2019t that just sick in itself? - but it\u2019s already too much. Aizawa had always known Hawks was fast but he\u2019s never seen him in action until just now. Before he can so much as <em>blink</em>, before Endeavour can pull his hand back, before Touya can cry, Hawks is behind them, said boy in his arms. One wing is flared out, the other curled around Touya protectively, and his eyes are burning. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t touch him.</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa\u2019s eyes widen ever so slightly. This isn\u2019t a job to Hawks, he suddenly realises. He isn\u2019t stringing Dabi along. No, there\u2019s feelings there and they\u2019re coming through like beacons now. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour blinks at him in confusion. \u201cThat\u2019s...Hawks, return my son.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks doesn\u2019t so much as bat an eyelid. \u201cSorry Enji-\u201d Aizawa takes satisfaction in how the hero reels there, \u201c-but I won\u2019t let Touya get hurt by you again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a beat and then suddenly the weight of that sentence seems to hit. There are implications there. Implications that one, Hawks knows what Endeavour\u2019s done behind closed doors and two, he knows Touya because Endeavour hasn\u2019t disclosed Touya\u2019s name to him yet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you were in on it,\u201d Endeavour realises, eyes narrowing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks doesn\u2019t answer him, just lifts Touya\u2019s chin with a hand. \u201cHey, you good?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya goes to nod before seemingly remembering something. He then shakes his head and bursts into tears. Hawks tightens his grip, tucks Touya further into his chest. He sends a pleading look at Aizawa and Toshinori and of course, they\u2019re trying to keep Touya <em>away</em> from things that upset him, that overload his emotions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can leave,\u201d he murmurs, so low only Aizawa can hear it. \u201cI can do that before Endeavour can catch me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa peers down at him. \u201cBut would you return him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He points at Touya by way of explanation and Hawks\u2019 cocks his head in confusion before suddenly all the blood drains from his face. He stumbles back a step, swallowing thickly, but in the exchange they\u2019ve forgotten the most volatile person in the room. And just like that, Endeavour\u2019s hand is wrapped around Hawks\u2019 arm, yanking him forward. There\u2019s the smell of burning, Hawks whimpering as some feathers are obviously caught in the crossfire but it doesn\u2019t make Endeavour relent. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy son, Hawks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Blue.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s the only colour Aizawa can see.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And heat. All he can feel is heat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His vision clears and Aizawa can only dread what he sees:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki Touya, aka Dabi, standing tall at over six feet, glaring at his father with murder in his eyes while Hawks nurses a burnt wing behind him. Endeavour looks shell shocked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>You</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi spares a look over his shoulder at Hawks. He then let his head loll forward, flames wrapping up his arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPayback time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>So many things happen in that next instant, Aizawa isn\u2019t sure he can catalogue them all. Dabi moves at the same time Hawks does, one going to attack, the other going to block. Endeavour is calling flames to his hand the same second Toshinori - <em>Toshinori</em>, god dammit! - jumps in front of him. Natsuo takes that moment to arrive and it\u2019s just a mess all around. Aizawa barely has time to activate his quirk and render Dabi useless before the two Todorokis collide.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Stop it!</em>\u201d Hawks hisses. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi\u2019s eyes narrow at him before flicking to Aizawa. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a command but Aizawa won\u2019t fall for it. Toshinori is pleading with Endeavour on the other side and perhaps the one thing that makes everyone pause, gives them a second to breathe, is Endeavour knocking Toshinori aside only for Toshinori to somehow summon from deep inside of him enough remnants of his quirk to become All Might. The change startles everyone; All Might may be gone but his form is as intimidating as it always was. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>Enough</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t shout the words but they boom all the same. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi seems about to dismiss him when Hawks says that one word that tilts the whole situation:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s like the air leaves the police station. Dabi whips around to Hawks, eyes wide with what Aizawa can only describe as panic. He\u2019s paler than ever and Natsuo takes that moment to cross the room and wrap a hand around Dabi\u2019s wrist. It\u2019s obvious he knows and Dabi reels at that too. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The whole exchange takes place in less than five seconds and Aizawa needs it to because he\u2019s reaching his limit and Toshinori clearly is too. He then says something he hopes he won\u2019t regret.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHawks, get them out of here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks, to his credit, doesn\u2019t second guess him at all. He and the two Todorokis are gone seconds later and Endeavour shouts in rage just as Toshinori stumbles back and ends up hacking into his hand as Naomasa supports him. Aizawa doesn\u2019t blink when Endeavour rounds on him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou let him escape.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI would have thought,\u201d he drawls, \u201cThat you\u2019d be more concerned about why your son openly tried to kill you. It\u2019s interesting...what could have driven him to do that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavour\u2019s eyes flash. \u201cYou know <em>nothing</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa scoffs, arms folding. \u201cI know surprisingly a lot. If I were you, I\u2019d let this go. At least, for now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t think he will, but something in his expression must be enough because Endeavour <em>actually</em> backs down. He\u2019s then storming to the door, phone in hand, and Aizawa has no doubt who he\u2019s ringing. Hopefully, Natsuo will be smart enough not to answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They land in a deserted park what is probably only minutes later. Natsuo goes to pull Touya into a hug but the hero Hawks stops him. He\u2019s about to protest when Touya abruptly pushes himself away and is violently ill into the rubbish bin closest. His motion sickness suddenly comes back to Natsuo but it also makes him frown a little because it seems as though Hawks knew about it. And how does Hawks, the number two hero, know that his brother, a high ranked villain, suffers from motion sickness? Something doesn\u2019t add up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still, once Touya composes himself, Natsuo passes over a bottle of water, huffing when it\u2019s snatched from his grip. \u201cNot even a thank you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His tone is teasing enough but Touya - or maybe it\u2019s Dabi - just sneers at him. The difference from two days ago is startling. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks groans. \u201cCivility guys, come on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All that does though is get Touya\u2019s attention to turn to him and Natsuo yelps when his brother suddenly has a fistful of Hawks\u2019 collar and is yanking him off the ground. \u201cAnd what was that stunt? Changing sides?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hawks merely rolls his eyes. \u201cWe were in a police station; my hands were tied. Anyway, don\u2019t you wanna know how you got there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s too much to unpack there but Natsuo is only concerned with how Touya suddenly looks uncertain, thrown. \u201cI\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo shuffles forward, tentatively holding out his phone. It\u2019s open to a photo he\u2019d taken at the festival; one of him and Touya. Touya barely spares the photograph a second of his time before doing a hilarious double take. The phone is snatched up and Natsuo can see him zooming in and scrolling through his camera roll. Luckily he has nothing incriminating on there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he\u2019s done, Touya turns straight to Hawks and yeah, that hurts a bit. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demands. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA quirk,\u201d Hawks supplies with a shrug, grinning breezily when Touya snarls at him. \u201cYou make an adorable toddler.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop teasing him,\u201d Natsuo says quietly, trying again at laying a hand on Touya\u2019s arm. Touya flinches but doesn\u2019t move away, even if his jaw is clenched so hard Natsuo is surprised his teeth don\u2019t shatter. \u201cYou were five-years-old again. Your memories were gone too. It was...odd.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow long?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFive days.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya stiffens. \u201cAnd you, what, <em>kept</em> me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re a <em>villain</em>,\u201d Hawks cuts in, tone icy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice. Plus, you were <em>five</em>. Who lets a five-year-old roam the streets?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou weren\u2019t locked up,\u201d Natsuo placates. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya snorts in derision. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Because you\u2019d all just let a villain walk around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo wants to hit him. Hawks actually does, though it\u2019s nothing more than a light punch to the stomach. \u201cPretty sure your brother just showed you pictures of you, you know, outside.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The third time is, apparently, the charm because it\u2019s the time that finally makes Touya snap. \u201cWhat do you mean, brother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s the wrong thing to say, to both of him. Natsuo\u2019s expression flattens while Hawks bristles in anger and this time it\u2019s <em>Hawks</em> dragging Touya down. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve Todoroki Touya, making me risk everything for you and your little gang when <em>you</em> were the one holding every card to your chest. You already fucked up with High End, and now I know it was personal. I\u2019d really rethink my strategy if I were you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEasy birdi-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya doesn\u2019t get to finish, Hawks doing something Natsuo isn\u2019t fast enough to catch and slamming his brother into the ground. \u201c<em>You</em> talk to him,\u201d he snaps at Natsuo before marching away, shoulders hunched over in what suspiciously looks like hurt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo looks back around just in time to see Touya look guilty. The look\u2019s gone as soon as it appears but it\u2019s enough, the pieces sliding together. He sighs. \u201cSo you and Hawks, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya stares down at him like he\u2019s the scum of the earth. \u201cSo pretentious, Todoroki Natsuo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t hit him, he doesn\u2019t, but Natsuo\u2019s hand stops just shy of his cheek, shoulders shaking as he tries not to sob. \u201cStop it, just stop it,\u201d he begs. \u201cYou\u2019re not...Touya, <em>please</em>. I know, okay? I know you had it so much worse than the rest of us and I know I didn\u2019t do enough and I should have. I <em>know</em> I failed you as a brother! I looked for you Touya, looked everywhere but you were just gone. So don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know me now! You\u2019re better than that!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya takes a subconscious step back. He has that look on his face that says he wasn\u2019t aware he was actually passable at anything, let alone above the bottom line. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNone of us are,\u201d Natsuo snaps. \u201cWe\u2019re all not what we used to be. How <em>could</em> we be? But you don\u2019t have to make it worse!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya flinches and Natsuo takes that as good enough. He embraces Touya and this time, he isn\u2019t pushed back. The hug isn\u2019t returned by any means but it\u2019s more than Natsuo expected. He lets go sooner than he\u2019d like but his smile remains a little longer. When it\u2019s time to talk though, Natsuo steps away. He nods in Hawks\u2019 direction. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey,\u201d - meaning the heroes, \u201c-refused to let Father near you. They\u2019ve been hiding you, keeping you safe. I think Hawks risked a lot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya stuffs his hands into his pockets. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo smiles sadly. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Touya doesn\u2019t reply, just stalks over to where Hawks is. Hawks looks unimpressed and honestly, Natsuo doesn\u2019t blame him. As the pair start talking, Natsuo fiddles with his phone. He\u2019s unsurprised at the amount of missed calls that stare back at him, all from the same person. He keeps his phone on \u2018do not disturb\u2019 and flicks a text Shouto\u2019s way to tell him to steer clear too. He gets a thumbs up back almost straight away which makes it clear their father\u2019s obviously been harrassing Shouto too. Typical. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo looks up at a noise up ahead, which turns out to be Hawks knocking Touya\u2019s hand away with a wing. Touya looks indignant while the hero looks betrayed and that\u2019s <em>worse</em> than him being angry in Natsuo\u2019s mind. Anger is easy to soothe. Broken trust? That\u2019s near impossible to repair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The pair come back over, Hawks looking anywhere but at Touya. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be on duty,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cAnd, I mean, I\u2019ll probably lose my job over this but I\u2019m leaving him with you. You do what you think is best.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo\u2019s mouth drops open, Touya\u2019s too, but then Hawks is gone. All that\u2019s left of him is a message appearing on Natsuo\u2019s phone and how did Hawks even get his number? </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Either way, he stomps on Touya\u2019s foot, scowling. \u201cYou need to fix that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa admits he is stunned hours later when there\u2019s a knock at his door and on the other side stands both Todoroki Natsuo and Touya. Dabi has a hoodie pulled over his face to obscure his appearance and he doesn\u2019t look ready to murder any of them. He\u2019s oddly quiet as Natsuo speaks for them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t know where to take him,\u201d he admits. \u201cI know Touya\u2019s done a lot of wrong things but if I took him to the police they\u2019d-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKid, murdering people isn\u2019t doing a \u201cwrong thing\u201d,\u201d Hizashi cuts in severely, Natsuo slumping.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers hoarsely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi is still silent and Aizawa groans, waving a hand. \u201cIn.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hizashi starts to protest but Aizawa just shakes his head. He also calls Naomasa and does so in front of Dabi so he knows where the lines are drawn. The villain glares at him the whole time but there\u2019s something off about him. He knows, then, what\u2019s happened to him. And he\u2019s scared. Scared, because he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s said or what he\u2019s confessed to. Dabi\u2019s eyes then land on the array of children\u2019s toys he and Hizashi haven\u2019t gotten around to cleaning yet and he stops dead in his tracks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI need to go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa\u2019s capture weapon activates then, as well as his quirk. \u201c<em>Don\u2019t</em> test me,\u201d he growls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTouya,\u201d Natsuo murmurs, or probably pleads.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi relents but he looks even more unhappy than before. His hands shake in a way Aizawa recognises from years on the job: he\u2019s itching for a smoke. Nerves will do that to you. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They awkwardly loiter in the living room until Naomasa arrives. Natsuo has tried to coerce Dabi into conversation but has been pushed away every time. Hizashi won\u2019t talk to anyone except Aizawa and Aizawa isn\u2019t particularly in the mood to talk. Even by bringing Dabi here, Natsuo has shown his brother too much. Aizawa\u2019s already contemplating where he and his husband should move to next, now that their home is compromised. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Naomasa gets let in and does what no one else has been able to do: make them sit. Dabi balks but Natsuo sends him a warning look that even Aizawa is willing to admit is good. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe came to you?\u201d Naomasa asks, as surprised as Aizawa was some thirty minutes ago.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<em>He</em> can hear you,\u201d Dabi snaps, brow pinched and by god does he look like Shouto in that instant; petulant and prideful. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re on thin ice; don\u2019t test me,\u201d Aizawa warns. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi folds his arms angrily and pointedly looks away, Natsuo rolling his eyes next to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere\u2019s our father?\u201d he asks, knee bouncing. \u201cDid he\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wasn\u2019t followed, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d Naomasa assures. \u201cAfter he stormed out, he hasn\u2019t been sighted. Hawks is out looking now; to give us a location update if nothing else.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow likely is it that this will end up in the news?\u201d Aizawa says, because it needs to be said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Naomasa replies, though he winces. \u201cWith the information and evidence we\u2019ve compiled, it won\u2019t look good on Endeavour. But it also doesn\u2019t look good on us. What we did was wrong, even if for the right reasons.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi sucks in a sharp breath there and then quickly pretends he didn\u2019t. Right. He\u2019s probably not used to people defending him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOur hands are tied. There\u2019s only one option available to us right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi makes to bolt even as Aizawa is ensnaring him once again. He\u2019s not an idiot. He knows what the option is: bring him in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d Natsuo protests, yanking his brother down and fiercely telling him off. \u201cIt\u2019s not...it wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomeone has to go jail Natsuo,\u201d Naomasa tells him gently. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, your brother\u2019s choices have put him there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut Father-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDidn\u2019t make him kill people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. What he did was <em>worse</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natsuo breaks down there and Aizawa feels his heart break. This isn\u2019t fair. This isn\u2019t fair on any of them but Naomasa is right. They can\u2019t hide this. They can\u2019t let Dabi escape. Even Dabi seems to know; of course he knows - it\u2019s why he\u2019s fighting so much. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe can try for a lesser sentence due to psychological damage,\u201d Naomasa tries but Natsuo just shakes his head. Surprisingly, Dabi is too. Although, he explains that a second later,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI make my own choices.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa calls bullshit, Natsuo does literally. \u201cPlease. Everything you\u2019ve done, everything you\u2019re doing, is because of him. Even if you don\u2019t think so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi looks away. They\u2019re all lost in thought until Natsuo passes his phone over. \u201cAlso, Hawks sent me this. He says it\u2019s for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi frowns but takes the phone. He makes an involuntary noise at whatever\u2019s on the screen but Aizawa doesn\u2019t even as to ask before Dabi is fumbling for the volume switch and watching with rapt attention. Aizawa recognises the voice within seconds: Touya.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cSo, he\u2019ll see me?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n<span> And there\u2019s Hawks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cWell, okay! Um...hi Dabi! You don\u2019t know me but I\u2019m Touya. Hawks says you\u2019re mad a lot but also really sad. I\u2019m sad too and sometimes mad. I\u2019m sorry bad things happened to you. They happened to me too; they still do...But it\u2019s okay because happy things happen too. I saw my mother yesterday - that made me happy!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa sees it, the crack in Dabi\u2019s composure there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cSo you can find something happy too. Hawks says he\u2019s your friend so that\u2019s something to be happy about! Um...I have to go but if you ever need to talk, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m always happy to help!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi snaps.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He drops the phone and sobs into his hands, great, heaving ones that shake his whole body. Natsuo is immediately at his side, wrapping his arms around him and shushing him. He\u2019s crying as well and it\u2019s all so wrong. The Todorokis cry in silence for a long time before Hizashi speaks up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe could kill him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa\u2019s head snaps up, even as Natsuo\u2019s whirling around and Dabi\u2019s hackles are rising.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhoa, not like that!\u201d Hizashi says, hands flailing. \u201cI mean, look, Shouta and I are going to have to move anyway. If Dabi came here and attacked us and died in the ensuing fight\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nobody moves for a long time. Nobody even breathes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa eventually says. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnless he promises,\u201d Naomasa cuts in, rounding past him and coming to crouch in front of Dabi. \u201cYou come with us; you get a fake identity, we change your appearance. You leave the League, you jump when we say jump, you report when I say and you leave nothing out. <em>But</em>, you get your family back. And Endeavour will never know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dabi holds his gaze for the longest time. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a tape, somewhere in a landfill station on the edge of Tokyo. It once held footage of Hawks and the villain Dabi in a...compromising situation. It\u2019s been miraculously wiped clean now. No one knows it exists. It\u2019s been there nearly four months. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which is good, seeing as how Hawks has had a new boyfriend for the past five weeks. Shizuka Shinsei seems nice enough; he\u2019s tall, has brown hair and bright grey eyes. If he has a quirk, he doesn\u2019t use it. He\u2019s met Endeavour but doesn\u2019t care for him, though he\u2019s made friends with both Todoroki Fuyumi and Natsuo. He\u2019s even gone with the youngest Todoroki to visit his mother sometimes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a strange world, it would seem.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>"
