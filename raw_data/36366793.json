  "text": "<p>Peter hears him approaching.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting on a rooftop in Manhattan. It\u2019s close to his favorite Mexican restaurant, which is actually Wade\u2019s favorite Mexican restaurant. He\u2019d never had it before Wade introduced it to him, showing up one night with a bag still warm from full of tacos, burritos, and empanadas.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that Wade is especially loud. In fact, he\u2019s so quiet so as to barely be noticeable. Peter certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to hear him without his advanced hearing, and he still wouldn\u2019t hear him if he hadn\u2019t grown so used to the sound of Wade sneaking up on him. It\u2019s as if his ears are specifically tuned to Deadpool\u2019s movements, solely because his spidey-sense gave up on detecting him years ago.</p>\n<p>If Peter really stops to think about it \u2014 which he does on occasion, if he\u2019s feeling especially bored \u2014 then he realizes how insane it is that he can hear Wade.</p>\n<p>Without concentrating, Peter can hear a <em>lot</em>. Two blocks over, a car\u2019s alarm is beeping. It\u2019s low and aggravating, but persistent enough to give Peter a headache if he focuses on it. He knows it isn\u2019t an emergency, though. It\u2019s because a particularly drunk bar-goer bumped into it while attempting to cross the street. Peter could hear his friends cajoling him after he tripped into it.</p>\n<p>At the base of the building, there\u2019s a steady stream of chatter. It\u2019s thanks to the people continuously passing underneath it, their conversations fading in and out as they come closer and drift away again, continuing down the sidewalk. There\u2019s a couple arguing at a corner across the street, and it\u2019s because the boyfriend forgot it was their anniversary and the girlfriend is pissed, because how can he remember which teams played in the Superbowl every year but not the important dates in their relationship?</p>\n<p>He can hear cars idling. Taxis honking. People laughing and a dog barking and a bat screeching somewhere in the distance. And, beneath it all, Peter can hear the careful scrape of Wade\u2019s boots against the building, followed by the faint tinkling of brick crumbling out from underneath him.</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t be able to hear it, even with his super-hearing. Or, he should be able to hear it, but it shouldn\u2019t be able to catch his attention. Not with everything else constantly attracting it, pulling his eyes and ears this way and that. Someone as quiet and stealthy as Wade shouldn\u2019t be on his radar at all, but he is.</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t be, if he were anyone else. If some random guy was climbing up the wall the way Wade is, the sound of him coming closer wouldn\u2019t register in Peter\u2019s brain at all. Instead, his spidey-sense would tingle somewhere near the base of his neck. Not spelling out <em>danger</em>, per se, but just letting him know.</p>\n<p>A tentative, feeble kind of warning.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Someone\u2019s almost here.</em>\n</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not a random guy, and for that reason, Peter\u2019s spidey-sense is silent. It\u2019s Wade. So the sound of the city takes a backseat as Peter\u2019s ears train on the <em>scritch, scritch, scritch</em>\u00a0of Wade\u2019s feet scraping against the building.</p>\n<p>Peter pretends not to notice. He stares off into the distance until the sound stops. Wade is quiet coming up a building, but he\u2019s <em>silent</em>\u00a0on solid ground. Peter wouldn\u2019t even know he were here if he\u2019d arrived another way.</p>\n<p>He gives him a second or two, allowing Wade to think he finally got the jump on Spidey. He\u2019s probably only a couple steps away when Peter finally speaks up. \u201cNo food tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod <em>dammit</em>,\u201d Wade huffs. He gives up on the silent approach and stomps the rest of the way, plopping onto the ledge next to Peter and knocking heavily into his shoulder as he sits. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna have to be better than that, DP,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so sure it was the smell giving me away,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>Peter laughs. It certainly hadn\u2019t helped. He can always smell it when Wade\u2019s bringing some sort or meal with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you something anyway,\u201d Wade grumbles, digging into his pouch and bringing out a chocolate bar. Peter just grins beneath the mask, accepting it without a word.</p>\n<p>Wade almost always brings him something. It must be a habit by now. When they first met \u2014 back when Peter was twenty \u2014 Wade never showed up empty handed. He was afraid that Peter didn\u2019t care for his company, only his food, so he always made sure that Peter would at least stay long enough to finish a meal.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter says, yanking his mask up to his nose and ripping open the chocolate bar. He breaks it in two, handing half of it to Wade. In the beginning, Wade would only bring one meal. He was too self-conscious to eat in front of Peter, and he always found some sort of excuse. He\u2019d claim that he ate his along the way, or that he was lactose intolerant, or that he\u2019d had a big lunch. Peter had realized immediately that Wade was insecure about his skin.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not anymore. He pulls up his mask without a hint of hesitation, biting straight into the chocolate without bothering to break off a clearly outlined chunk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to the zoo,\u201d Peter says, unprompted. It\u2019s a game of theirs. They\u2019ve played it for as long as Peter can remember, and it\u2019s never failed to start a good conversation.</p>\n<p>It was Wade who started it. They\u2019d only been acquaintances for a short while, and usually whenever Peter finished eating whatever Wade had brought him, they\u2019d abruptly run out of things to talk about, as if Peter\u2019s meal was also a timeline for how long they could talk for. Probably just because it\u2019s easier to talk when at least one party is distracted.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Peter had finished the last of his Slurpee from 7-Eleven, the straw sucking loudly at the dregs of the treat, when Wade had cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand opera music,\u201d he\u2019d blurted. \u201cIt\u2019s always sounded boring to me. Those kids on America\u2019s Got Talent will show up and belt them out and everyone goes wild, but I can\u2019t stand it. It\u2019s unbearable,\u201d he\u2019d said. And then, more to himself than to Peter: \u201cAnd they always get that stupid Golden Buzzer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Peter had said. \u201cSinging opera takes an insane amount of talent. There\u2019s more vocal control there than most kinds of singing.\u201d</p>\n<p>And from there, their conversation had thrived. They\u2019d argued for at least ten minutes, and somehow, the conversation had shifted to something new.</p>\n<p>Now, they often begin conversations with a random fact about themselves. Something they love or can\u2019t stand or haven\u2019t done or refuse to try. Something completely random that they don\u2019t already know about the other.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always harmless, something that can\u2019t be used to figure out Spider-Man\u2019s identity, and Wade follows the same rules even though everyone already knows his.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Wade says, even though they both know that Peter\u2019s telling the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Peter says. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t get the appeal. I was supposed to go in the fifth grade, but I got sick the night before the field trip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade scoffs. \u201cHow do you not get the appeal?\u201d he says. \u201cWhere else will you ever see a lion in real life? Or a penguin? That\u2019s literally the whole appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cWhy would I want to walk around and look at animals being held captive? I could watch Animal Planet and see them in the wild where they belong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of those animals are being rehabilitated,\u201d Wade says, sniffing imperiously. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s just a fun time. It\u2019s an experience everyone needs to have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoubt it,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d Wade insists. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughs, shaking his head. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he lies.</p>\n<p>Out of the two of them, most people would probably pick Deadpool to be the liar. He\u2019s the mercenary. The more violent of the two, the more chaotic. He\u2019s supposed to be unpredictable. Unreliable.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s only caught him in a lie on rare occasions. Not including lies that hold literally no weight at all. But the lies Wade has told him have always been for good reason. Like things he\u2019s trying to shield Peter from or situations in which he\u2019s afraid Spidey might somehow end up getting hurt.</p>\n<p>But Peter? He lies all the time. Not just white lies, but huge ones. He\u2019s constantly deflecting, constantly making things up and omitting the truth in an attempt to keep his identity a secret. Half the time, Peter\u2019s pretty sure that Wade knows he\u2019s lying, but he rarely calls him out on it.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t like those times.</p>\n<p>Wade scoffs, shaking his head and elbowing Peter in the side. \u201cSure,\u201d he says, sarcastic. \u201cThat\u2019s why your spidey-sense doesn\u2019t see me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s on the verge of laughing, wanting to join Wade in his amusement, but he freezes. His entire body goes still. He finds himself staring at a roof three buildings over, not even looking at anything. Two blocks away, the car alarm finally shuts off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never told you that,\u201d Peter says, the realization startling him.</p>\n<p>Wade knows about his spidey-sense. He knew even before Peter told him. He\u2019d noticed the way that Peter could detect things without looking, without even realizing. How his body would react before his mind had even caught on.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen Peter freeze in battle, seen him leap out of the way of gunshots and whip toward an undetected danger. But Peter\u2019s never so much as mentioned that Wade doesn\u2019t trip that invisible wire that everyone else constantly stumbles across.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Wade says, oblivious to Peter\u2019s surprise. \u201cIt was obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Wade says. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s all in your body language.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy body language,\u201d Peter repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wade says. \u201cYou used to stiffen if I was even a roof or two away from you. You even used to turn to look at me before I started talking, like you knew I was going to say something before I even opened my mouth. It hasn\u2019t been like that for years, though. Now you never know what I\u2019m going to do. You don\u2019t know where I am unless you hear me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is doubly shocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that I hear you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d Wade says simply. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s turning Peter\u2019s world upside down. \u201cYou can hear at least a couple blocks away, if you concentrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade lied. He lied when he said that he thought Peter was detecting him by smell, and Peter didn\u2019t realize. Maybe he stretches the truth more often than Peter thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never told you that,\u201d Peter points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you knew that I knew,\u201d Wade says. He takes another heathen-esque bite of his chocolate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re scarily observant,\u201d Peter points out. No one else can avoid Peter\u2019s spidey-sense like Wade can. Even people that mean no harm trip it. Like, constantly. Peter could probably close his eyes and navigate the streets of New York, avoiding each and every pedestrian on the sidewalk. At least, unless Wade was the one walking toward him.</p>\n<p>Wade just chuckles, not realizing how far out of left field this is for Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a mercenary, Webs,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t notice things, I\u2019d be dead. Like, before all the immortal-plus-walking-Accutane-advertisement shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Normally, Peter gives villains 110% of his attention.</p>\n<p>A villain isn\u2019t just some criminal. Criminals are predictable. They\u2019re normal people, lacking in morals and often driven to desperation. Villains are a different caliber. By Peter\u2019s definition, they\u2019re the ones with powers, with more extreme motives.</p>\n<p>That being said, the power of flooding New York\u2019s streets without thousands of bunnies isn\u2019t particularly pressing. Inconvenient, yes. But deadly? Not so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake <em>that</em>, Spider-Man!\u201d the evil bunny villain cackles. \u201cNow no one can get home without running over defenseless animals! They\u2019ll be distraught!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade lifts a manhole cover and kicks several bunnies inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool!\u201d Peter reprimands. \u201cStop kicking bunnies into the sewer!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d Wade says, still sweeping them toward their demise. \u201cThere are thousands of them. We\u2019ll never find them all a home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you know what they say about bunnies,\u201d Wade continues. \u201cSoon enough, there\u2019ll be even more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake this! And that!\u201d Looney Tunes \u2014 emphasis on the Looney \u2014 says. More bunnies multiply around Peter. He webs up at least a hundred of them and hangs them from a lamppost, hoping a hundred children with extremely lenient parents happen to walk by.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Peter is currently facing off with a villain, he can\u2019t really give this battle his full attention. Rather than needing to constantly intervene and save civilians, he\u2019s actually letting them get closer than usual. They\u2019re helping more than they usually do, some of them even cooing over the bunnies and picking them up. Peter can only hope that they decide to take them home.</p>\n<p>Plus, Wade\u2019s accidentally commandeering most of Peter\u2019s attention. They\u2019re a great team in most battles. Peter hardly needs to look at him in order to fight with him, able to swing and attack with just his instincts alone. They can aid each other easily, constantly stepping up where one excels in a certain skillset over the other, but this isn\u2019t like those times.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere!\u201d Wade cries, shoving a handful of bunnies into a car\u2019s open window. \u201cFree bunnies.\u201d</p>\n<p>The driver protests, but Wade\u2019s already directing them out of the street. \u201cJust take a left right down there,\u201d he says. \u201cRun over as many of them as you can, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, Peter is able to web Jack Rabbit before he can summon bunnies to block him, and the villain gets stuck to the side of a building, struggling uselessly. He calls for the bunnies to help, but they largely ignore him. They just hop around aimlessly. Wade left the manhole uncovered, and there\u2019s a pretty steady stream of bunnies walking into the open hole with no regard for their lives.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d Wade says barely ten minutes later, having shoved as many bunnies into as many cars as possible. He grabs his katanas, twirling them meaningfully. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to want to see what happens next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says abruptly, horrified. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s seriously no other option,\u201d Wade says. \u201cIt\u2019s this or let a billion bunnies roam free in New York. They\u2019re domesticated, Spidey. They won\u2019t even last a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shuffles his weight from one foot to the other, indecisive. On one hand, Wade has a point. There\u2019s nowhere for these bunnies to go and no logical conclusion other than what Wade has in mind. On the other hand, Peter doesn\u2019t want to approve the slaughter of this many innocent lives.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you could stay here,\u201d Wade adds, shrugging carelessly. \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t even see most of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stares at him blankly. He trusts that the expression translates through the mask.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow would I not see it?\u201d he says, incredulous.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyesight isn\u2019t that good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, you wear glasses,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s right and wrong. Peter does wear glasses. Out of the suit, at least. But his eyesight is incredible. The glasses are just to keep up appearances.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter echoes, too dumbfounded to manage anything else.</p>\n<p>Wade does some little gesture. He nudges his knuckle against the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you always do,\u201d Wade says. \u201cLike you\u2019re trying to push up a pair of glasses that isn\u2019t actually there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 do that,\u201d Peter says. At least, he isn\u2019t aware of himself doing that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, you do,\u201d Wade says. \u201cAll the time. I figure you\u2019re pretty blind in the suit. Oh! Or maybe you wear contacts?\u201d He\u2019s silent for five seconds at most. \u201cWait. You just wear glasses out of the suit because your eyesight used to be bad, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow,\u201d Peter says, numb. \u201cHow could you possibly know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Wade says. \u201cI guessed. But you just confirmed it. What kind of glasses do you wear, Spidey? Circles? Squares? Oooh, those Gen-Z clear ones that everyone\u2019s obsessed with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re terrifying. You know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d Wade says. \u201cNow scurry on home. I have to carrot-e chop these bunnies. With katanas. Shit, no \u2014 I have to <em>burrow</em>\u00a0these bunnies in the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHorrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wait</em>. Knock knock!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlice who.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlice these bunnies would <em>wonder</em> to another <em>land</em>. Get it? Alice? Kind of like \u2018I wish\u2019? It doesn\u2019t really work, does it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBye.\u201d He shoots off a web and is already swinging away when Wade calls after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I have another one!\u201d he cries. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>rabbit season</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Peter slides open the window and wriggles into Wade\u2019s apartment, closing it behind him with a foot. The living room is empty, which usually means Wade isn\u2019t home. For whatever reason \u2014 probably because Wade is more adult-like than Peter ever will be \u2014 he doesn\u2019t tend to hang out in his room. He thinks a bed is solely for sleeping and not for spending time in.</p>\n<p>Peter disagrees. He owns a couch mostly because Aunt May told him that everyone needs a couch. When Peter\u2019s home, he\u2019s usually sitting in his bed with his laptop.</p>\n<p>He makes his way into the kitchen, pulling open the fridge and analyzing its contents. It\u2019s full of leftovers, but it\u2019s always hard to tell how old the leftovers are in Wade\u2019s fridge. Most of the time, it\u2019s not safe to eat.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<strong>23:52</strong><br>\n<em>beat u home</em><br>\n<em>[1 Image Attachment]</em>\n</p>\n<p>Peter shoots off the text to Wade, including a picture of him standing in front of the open fridge holding up a peace sign.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23:52</strong><br>\n<em>i think chinese is from ystrday</em><br>\n<em>or i can pick up pizza</em><br>\n<em>whatever u want bb</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<strong>23:53</strong><br>\n<em>pizza? \ud83d\udc40</em>\n</p>\n<p>Peter makes himself at home on Wade\u2019s couch, turning on the TV and letting whatever Wade was watching last continue playing.</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s apartment is like their home base. It\u2019s where they go when they want to hang out without being \u201con duty.\u201d</p>\n<p>It used to make Peter nervous, coming here. He was afraid that accepting the invitation would mean that one day, Wade would expect the same in return. That he\u2019d start begging Peter to let him come over to his apartment, which would be just one short step from Wade figuring out Peter\u2019s identity. But Wade has never asked, and despite the fact that Wade figuring out Peter\u2019s identity doesn\u2019t give him anxiety anymore, he\u2019s never offered.</p>\n<p>He likes what they have. The rhythm, the comfort, the <em>known</em>. Even though he knows it wouldn\u2019t matter if Wade knew his identity, he\u2019s still hesitant to switch things up.</p>\n<p>By the time Wade returns, ten minutes have passed and Peter\u2019s stolen a pair of sweatpants out of the dresser in his bedroom, having put them on over his suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, baby boy,\u201d Wade says, setting three boxes of pizza on the table before Peter and collapsing onto the couch next to him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were comin\u2019 over tonight.\u201d He scoots closer, squeezing a hand behind Peter\u2019s back and then tugging him into a hug, resting his head on Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Wade is the touchiest person Peter knows. He\u2019s also the only person Peter would tolerate it from. He wraps an arm around Wade\u2019s shoulders and precariously maneuvers a box closer to them, balancing it on the top of his foot. Wade grabs them each a slice once it\u2019s within reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it,\u201d Peter admits. \u201cBut I was close by and I figured I\u2019d see what you were up to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing as fun as this,\u201d Wade says. Then he glances down and plucks at the waistband of Peter\u2019s sweatpants. Wade\u2019s sweatpants. \u201cThese are mine,\u201d he points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was cold,\u201d Peter says. And then he clears his throat. \u201cActually, there\u2019s another reason I came by.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Wade says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind doing sexual favors, but I prefer some advanced notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snorts, kicking him in the shin. Across the room, the clock on the oven glows the time. 00:09. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade gasps, planting a hand on Peter\u2019s thigh and using it as leverage to sit up, pulling away from Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight now,\u201d Peter agrees, unable to tamp down his grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWebs!\u201d Wade blurts. \u201cYou asshole! I would\u2019ve gotten a cake! Or, I don\u2019t know, ice cream or something. Not just some shitty pizza!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pizza\u2019s great,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah. But it\u2019s not <em>birthday</em>\u00a0great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughs. He leans back into Wade, and Wade is gracious enough nowadays to let Peter initiate contact without calling attention to it. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he insists. \u201cI don\u2019t usually do anything for my birthday, anyway. I just wanted to hang out if you were free.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always free for you,\u201d Wade insists. He grabs them each another piece of pizza. \u201cWow. You can rent cars now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing I have left to look forward to is retirement,\u201d Peter agrees, giggling softly. And then he tilts his head. \u201cWait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade cackles. \u201cLet me guess. \u2018But Deadpool! How do you know how old I am?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter purses his lips. Takes a bite of his pizza and ignores him. After he swallows, he nods. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we started hanging out when you were twenty,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich I never told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, but two years before we started hanging out, your Spidey schedule changed drastically. It wasn\u2019t just after 4 p.m. and on the weekends \u2014 it was different times on different days of the week. As if you were working around shifts rather than school.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s absurd. Who notices something like that?</p>\n<p>\u201cI could\u2019ve been 19,\u201d Peter protests. \u201cOr 21.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but the majority of people graduate at 18. You could\u2019ve skipped a grade, you\u2019re definitely smart enough, but most parents decide to keep their kids in the same grade so they\u2019ll stick with the people their age. Not that you have parents,\u201d Wade adds. Peter\u2019s fingers clench into the cushion under his thighs because he\u2019s never told Wade that either. Wade winces. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t bother asking how he knows. He\u2019s probably dropped a million unintentional hints, if the way these conversations have been going are any indication.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Peter huffs. \u201cYes, I\u2019m 25.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade squeezes him. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Peter knows that Wade is smart. It was one of the first things he noticed about him.</p>\n<p>And Wade isn\u2019t just smart in the scary, analytical, tactical mercenary way. He\u2019s just genuinely <em>smart</em>. As in, Peter once recommended a book, not thinking Wade would actually take the time to read it, and a week later they\u2019d had a highly intellectual conversation about its themes and whether the author was intentionally writing about the perils of colonization (they decided that yes, she was).</p>\n<p>He\u2019s smart in the way that Peter can ramble on and on about his research and the ways he\u2019s experimenting with his web fluid and Wade can challenge him and suggest new ideas without having known anything about the subject beforehand. He\u2019s ridiculous and corny and funny and leud, but he\u2019s also secretly a genius and that\u2019s not something that most people know about him.</p>\n<p>One time, Wade ranted to Peter about how much he\u2019d hated school, arguing against Peter\u2019s love for school. He\u2019d gotten horrible grades consistently, but it was solely because school hadn\u2019t challenged him enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do they have to harp on about the same subject for two weeks?\u201d Wade had scoffed. \u201cBy the time they give you the test it\u2019s not even interesting anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anyway. Peter knows Wade\u2019s smart. He knows he\u2019s observant and that being smart comes easily and naturally to him. Peter\u2019s rarely surprised when Wade says something he wasn\u2019t expecting, because he knows that Wade has the capacity for it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just surprised that Wade knows all this shit about <em>him</em>. Because Peter\u2019s smart too. And more than that, he\u2019s careful. He\u2019s secretive. His identity has always been one of his top priorities and even knowing how smart Wade is, Peter had never thought that he wasn\u2019t doing enough to guard the secrets of identity.</p>\n<p>Every time Wade points something out about him that he shouldn\u2019t even know \u2014 and so easily and thoughtlessly, like he\u2019s known it for a while and not just realizing it for the first time \u2014 it shocks Peter to his core. It feels like Wade is stripping layers away from him, uncovering who Peter really is.</p>\n<p>Actually, no. It feels like the layers aren\u2019t even there. Like Peter deluded himself into thinking they were but he was naked the whole time and never even realized it.</p>\n<p>What else does Wade know about him? What other stores of information are just casually hanging out in Wade\u2019s mind, as if they aren\u2019t a big deal?</p>\n<p>Whatever. Now probably isn\u2019t the time to be thinking about this anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw,\u201d Wade whimpers, hopping again and leaning against Peter even harder. His foot is missing. He hasn\u2019t told Peter what happened to it, but Wade has a pretty high track record of getting stuck in insane places and just cutting off his own limbs to free himself. He doesn\u2019t have the patience to wiggle out of tight situations.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop trying to walk,\u201d Peter says, attempting to ignore Wade as he squints down at his phone. He\u2019s also trying to ignore his own paranoia. He\u2019s aware that Wade is staring over his shoulder at his phone and normally Peter wouldn\u2019t think twice about it, but now he\u2019s wondering what information he\u2019s unintentionally giving away.</p>\n<p>Did anything identifying pop up when he googled \u2018CVS near me\u2019? What about his apps? His wallpaper? God, Wade probably knows the scent and brand of Peter\u2019s deodorant, just by being so close to him right now.</p>\n<p>This is stupid. Peter doesn\u2019t need to be thinking about this so hard, much less freaking out about it. It\u2019s just <em>Wade</em>. Peter\u2019s lifestyle doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for socializing or making friends, and Peter has secretly thought of Wade as his best friend for the last four and a half years. Wade definitely knows that.</p>\n<p>When something funny happens to Peter, Wade is always the first person he thinks of to tell. He\u2019s the most common character in all of Peter\u2019s dreams. He\u2019s the only person (besides Aunt May) who Peter makes plans with. Peter genuinely loves him as a person and as a friend and perhaps-accidentally as something a bit more and it doesn\u2019t <em>matter</em>\u00a0if Wade knows everything there is to know about Peter. The fact that the things he knows about Peter aren\u2019t a big deal to him is just further evidence that Peter has no reason to worry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like anything\u2019s open,\u201d Peter says. Wade doesn\u2019t actually need medical supplies to heal, but Peter knows from experience that it speeds up the process and results in his skin being less irritated after the fact.</p>\n<p>Wade whines. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a first aid kit?\u201d he says, slumping into Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot on me,\u201d Peter says. \u201cYou know, you should start carrying this kind of stuff in your pouches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo room,\u201d Wade says. \u201cThe condoms and lube take up all the space.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter ignores him. \u201cHow is nothing open right now?\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant in your apartment,\u201d Wade elaborates, ignoring Peter right back. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta have stuff in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut we\u2019re in an alley. Not my apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade just stares at him. \u201cBut you live around here,\u201d he says. Peter doesn\u2019t freeze or stiffen or allow himself to feel shocked at all. He just accepts it. This is his life now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Peter says. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not ready to show you where I live right this second.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course not, baby boy,\u201d Wade says. \u201cBut maybe you could swing over there, grab some stuff, and come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter purses his lips. \u201cSure,\u201d he decides. He tucks his phone away, wraps his arm around Wade\u2019s waist, and webs them to the top of the nearest building. He sets Wade down between two HVAC units, leaning him against one and creating a miniature hammock against the other for Wade to prop his foot on. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hero,\u201d Wade sighs, and Peter takes a running leap off the building.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t bother with any of the shit he normally would\u2019ve bothered with. He doesn\u2019t leave in the opposite direction so that he can loop around and disguise which direction his apartment is actually in. He doesn\u2019t take longer than he needs to in an attempt to make Wade thinks he lives farther away then he really does. He just swings straight home, climbs through the window, grabs what he needs from his bathroom, and heads back.</p>\n<p>Wade is right where Peter left him, now scrolling on his phone. It\u2019s aimed at Peter when he lands, and he knows from experience that he\u2019s going to see some video of himself with a weird filter applied on Wade\u2019s Snapchat story later.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeel any better?\u201d Peter asks, squatting next to Wade\u2019s foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeelin\u2019 all right,\u201d Wade says, wiggling his non-stump right foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo out of ten,\u201d Peter says. He reaches for Wade\u2019s injured leg, carefully rolling the material of his suit out of the way. Wade\u2019s injuries used to gross Peter out, but he\u2019s too used to it by now. \u201cSo,\u201d he says as he uncaps the Hydrogen peroxide. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I lived around here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter where we meet up, if you\u2019re just starting your patrol, you always swing like you\u2019re coming from Queens,\u201d Wade says simply. \u201cI figured you lived around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou figured right,\u201d Peter says, wincing in sympathy as he pours the antiseptic on Wade, who hisses. \u201cI have a shitty little apartment near here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet it has tons of character,\u201d Wade assures him. \u201cYou\u2019re not worried that I knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just shrugs. \u201cNothing you do worries me,\u201d he says, realizing that it\u2019s true. He finishes up with Wade\u2019s leg, and then he settles down beside him to wait. They spend the next hour talking and scrolling through Wade\u2019s TikTok likes, which Peter always complains about secretly enjoys.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Wade drives with his left hand on top of the steering wheel and his right elbow sitting on the center console, an energy drink dangling from his fingers. Music is thrumming lowly in the background, hooked up to Wade\u2019s phone, and Peter sits with his feet smushed between the dashboard and the windshield, leaving footprints against the glass.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never driven anywhere with Wade before. Never seen him drive. And he\u2019s realizing abruptly that he finds it incredibly hot for absolutely no reason.</p>\n<p>Maybe it has something to do with seeing someone you know in a completely new setting for the first time. Peter would probably be similarly aware and irrationally excited to see Wade in other new settings, like navigating through an airport or dropping off a package at the post office. Actually, Peter distinctly remembers feeling this same way when he went to Wade\u2019s apartment for the time. It was just new and different \u2014 Wade comfortable in his own home, sprawled out on his couch rather than the ledge of a building.</p>\n<p>Wade was hired to pick up something three and a half hours away. Not his usual kind of work, but a job he accepted nonetheless. Apparently, a girl left a few important belongings at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s house. She doesn\u2019t want to see him and he refused to mail them to her, wanting to force her to see him again, so she decided to hire Deadpool. A little extra assurance that her ex would return her stuff without her having to ask again.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s tagging along just because. Wade invited him, not ecstatic about a long drive on his own, and Peter accepted because he has nothing better to do today and a road trip sounded fun.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fascinated about every aspect of Wade driving. Peter never learned how to drive \u2014 there isn\u2019t really a reason to when you live in the city and can swing anywhere anyway \u2014 but now that Wade\u2019s driving, he\u2019s endlessly entertained. Just\u2026 the way Wade does everything without even thinking, everything about driving coming naturally to him. Glancing into the mirrors, merging into other lanes, talking to Peter while looking at the road. Somehow, it\u2019s all ridiculously attractive.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know a lot of things about me that no one else knows,\u201d Peter says. Wade flashes his high beams and lets a truck that\u2019s been trying to merge over cut in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Wade says. \u201cThat\u2019s just what happens when you\u2019re really close. It\u2019s the same for me,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who knows a shit ton of stuff about me,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Peter says. For some reason, he thought it only went one way. That Wade knew everything about him, and Peter knew a lot about Wade, but that it was just random stuff. Shit anyone could know.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wade says. \u201cLike the boxes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter frowns. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know about the boxes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade shakes his head. \u201cThey just assume I talk to myself. Or they might think that I hear voices, but they don\u2019t know for sure. No one else knows that there\u2019s two distinct ones with different personalities. Or that they\u2019re not even voices, necessarily, but <em>boxes</em>. It\u2019s different and I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d Except he has. He explained it to Peter when he asked him about it once. Peter had already figured that he was hearing voices, and that there were two of them \u2014 one meaner than the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Peter says, suddenly ravenous for more. Wade\u2019s mouth quirks up, amused. He takes another sip of his energy drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many languages do I speak?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter scoffs. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he says. \u201cA million. All of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just that Wade travels to other countries easily, never worried about being lost or confused because of the foreign language. It\u2019s also the way that whenever they\u2019re watching movies, if a character says something in another language \u2014 even if there intentionally aren\u2019t subtitles \u2014 Wade always laughs. They\u2019re usually making some kind of joke, saying something that only a smaller audience gets to enjoy, and Wade <em>always</em>\u00a0knows what they say. No matter the language.</p>\n<p>At first, Peter just thought he was pretending to get it. He caught on rather quickly that Wade was actually fluent in more languages than Peter could ever hope to count.</p>\n<p>Wade just shrugs. \u201cMost people think I only speak one language. Two at most.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gapes. He scoots back in his seat, moving his feet to the floor to sit up and pay better attention to the conversation. \u201cWhat else?\u201d he repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that my skin is sensitive. That I have good and bad skin days and good and bad brain days. You know that it freaks me out when I feel trapped somewhere.\u201d Evident by Wade chopping his limps off far too often.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was the only one who knew these things about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade grins. He flicks on the turn signal and gets into the next lane. \u201cI like you knowing stuff about me, Webs. Makes me feel good. I like knowing stuff about you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles. He can feel himself blushing and he doesn\u2019t even know why. \u201cI like it too,\u201d he admits. Realizes.</p>\n<p>The conversation shifts and they spend the next hour talking about past relationships, brought on by a debate over why the girl and her ex broke up and how long they might\u2019ve dated beforehand.</p>\n<p>Peter talks about Gwen, who he\u2019s mentioned to Wade in passing before. He already knows the whole sob story, but Peter focuses on the good times instead. How they got together, what kind of dates they went on, and a particularly amusing debate about whether Peter would still love her if she turned into a worm.</p>\n<p>In return, Wade tells him about Vanessa. Peter already knows some of the story, but like Peter, Wade reminisces on the better parts instead. He tells Peter about the stupid inside jokes they\u2019d had, how she\u2019d been the first person who he\u2019d known before Weapon X that hadn\u2019t called him ugly afterward, and how they\u2019d lived together for a time, which Wade hadn\u2019t expected to love as much as he did.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve taken an exit and are on a different stretch of highway by the time the conversation lulls. Wade hums along to the music, his knee bouncing to the rhythm. Peter feels content and soft and just a little bit in love.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, when did you get here?\u201d Wade jokes. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cSerious question,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I genuinely don\u2019t care about the answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know my identity?\u201d</p>\n<p>The thought has been plaguing Peter for a couple weeks now. Well, maybe plaguing isn\u2019t the right word. A few months ago, Peter probably would\u2019ve been freaking out if the thought even crossed his mind. He\u2019d be anxious and jittery, scared of the possibility and wary of giving himself away.</p>\n<p>Recently, the thought popped into Peter\u2019s head and hasn\u2019t gone away, but it\u2019s more out of curiosity than anything else. Wade knows so much about him. What are the chances that he knows that Spider-Man is Peter Parker, and he just hadn\u2019t made a big deal out of it?</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course not,\u201d Wade says. He shakes his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter chews on the inside of his cheek. \u201cBut you could,\u201d he realizes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, easily,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Peter says. \u201cIt\u2019d be easy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me,\u201d Wade corrects. \u201cNot anyone else. You\u2019re fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hums. Wade could, apparently, find out his identity. Easily. But he hasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter says. \u201cLet\u2019s make a bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade perks up. He sits up a little straighter. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee if you can find out my identity,\u201d Peter says. \u201cWithout, like, tracking me or following me home. You just have to come up to me on the street.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou serious, baby boy?\u201d Wade says. \u201cBecause I need you to be deathly serious. I <em>will</em>\u00a0find out if you\u2019re givin\u2019 me permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to tell you how I\u2019m gonna do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cTell me after,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of the trip, he\u2019s giddy. Excited. His nerves are gone. All he can think about is when it\u2019s going to happen, where, how. What it\u2019ll be like when Wade strolls up to him \u2014 regular old Peter Parker \u2014 and gives him a once over, grinning behind the mask.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long day.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s alarm didn\u2019t go off this morning, which pretty much set the tone. He missed breakfast, which caused him to be cranky until his lunch break, and the line at the deli was so long that Peter had to each his sandwich on the walk back to the lab, only furthering his bad mood.</p>\n<p>Plus, the specimen he was supposed to be examining wasn\u2019t stored properly by whoever was working with them last time, and it took Peter longer than it should have to realize that the cells he was looking at weren\u2019t supposed to look that way at all.</p>\n<p>Now, Peter\u2019s desperately attempting to turn his mood around. He didn\u2019t have to work late, which was nice, and he has leftovers from last night which he can heat up for dinner, which is always good. After that he can suit up and start swinging around the city, which always doubles as a nice warm-up and a mood lifter. If he\u2019s lucky, Wade might already be out and about by the time he hits the rooftops and then he won\u2019t even have to text him and wait for him to meet him somewhere. Fingers crossed.</p>\n<p>His little bet with Wade isn\u2019t even on his mind as he walks home. They shook on it just two days ago, and even with Wade\u2019s skills, it\u2019ll probably take him a bit of time to work out who Spider-Man is.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just lost in his thoughts, drifting with New York\u2019s crowds along the sidewalks. He almost does a doubletake when he sees Deadpool.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s perched on a newspaper box, his legs swinging where they dangle above the ground. Peter averts his eyes immediately, not sure whether Wade noticed him or not.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no way. Just genuinely, absolutely no way. Wade couldn\u2019t have figured out his identity in just two days. He definitely can\u2019t pick Peter out of a crowd. For all Peter knows, he\u2019s staking out right here for some kind of job, totally unaware that Spider-Man is passing by him on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Unable to help it, Peter glances back at him, just wanting to get another look.</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s staring straight at him. He\u2019s smirking underneath the mask. The second he realizes he has Peter\u2019s attention, he raises his hand \u2014 just barely \u2014 and curls his finger. <em>Come hither.</em></p>\n<p>Peter gapes. Wade throws his head back and cackles. And when he jumps off the box and heads into an alley, Peter follows.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How</em>?\u201d he says, the second he catches up to him. Wade doesn\u2019t answer. He\u2019s still getting over his fit of giggles, but he fights through it in order to grab Peter by the waist and shove him lightly against the wall behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man,\u201d he wheezes. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, <em>how</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s fingers dig into Peter\u2019s sides, just squeezing him, holding him there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour facial expressions,\u201d Wade coos. He squeals. \u201cYour <em>hair</em>! Fuck, your <em>glasses</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool,\u201d Peter says. Wade slides his hands up and down Peter\u2019s sides, as if making sure he\u2019s real.</p>\n<p>\u201cClothes,\u201d Wade continues. \u201cReal clothes. On your body.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Pool,\u201d Peter huffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable, Peter Parker,\u201d Wade says. Peter blushes. For the first time, it\u2019s not hidden behind his mask.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease just tell me,\u201d Peter whines.</p>\n<p>Wade doesn\u2019t release him. If anything, he creeps even closer. \u201cThe average American commutes 26 minutes to work. I knew you were a scientist and guessed you worked in a lab, and I know what general area you live in. I also know you\u2019re broke, so it probably wasn\u2019t some big company or a super fancy job. I guessed that you\u2019d probably walk to work, not ride the subway, because that\u2019d cost extra money and you\u2019d rather your workplace be within walking distance in case of Spidey emergencies and your suit was at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fucking insane.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026 how\u2019d you know it was <em>me</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI recognized you yesterday, actually,\u201d Wade says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t wanna confront you until I knew your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou recognized me,\u201d Peter says dumbly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPosture, build, glasses, the way you walk,\u201d Wade says carelessly, as if that alone isn\u2019t impressive. \u201cBut I wanted to know your name, so \u2014 well, I stole this. Yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade releases Peter with one hand and holds out the keycard he uses to enter the lab. Peter thought he left it at home today.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he breathes, accepting the keycard.</p>\n<p>Yesterday. Wade was close enough to him <em>yesterday</em>\u00a0to pick-pocket him. And Peter didn\u2019t see him, hear him, or feel him. He didn\u2019t even notice him.</p>\n<p>Wade bounces on the heels of his feet, squeezing Peter\u2019s sides again. \u201cCan I see your apartment now?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m so curious I could die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughs. His head pitches forward and Wade\u2019s standing close enough that Peter\u2019s face just bonks into Wade\u2019s chest. He isn\u2019t freaked out, he\u2019s just impressed. Wade is scarily impressive.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says, shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade follows him like an excited puppy the entire way to Peter\u2019s apartment. He bounds up the endless stares, chattering a million miles a minute (<em>\u2014and I knew you didn\u2019t even notice me, Petey, I knew it!</em>) and then he examines every inch of Peter\u2019s apartment the second he gets inside.</p>\n<p>He rifles through drawers, tests Peter\u2019s couch, peeks into the bathroom, and collapses on Peter\u2019s bed. \u201cWhere do you hide the suit?\u201d he asks, and before Peter can answer: \u201cWait! Don\u2019t tell me, I wanna see if I can guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s done exploring the apartment, he\u2019s back to exploring Peter. He grabs his arm and squeals at the freckle just above the inside of his elbow. He flips the tag out from Peter\u2019s shirt at the back of his neck \u2014 \u201cTotally guessed you were a medium\u201d \u2014 and he buries a gloved hand in Peter\u2019s hair, apparently unable to help it.</p>\n<p>Peter just lets it happen, embarrassed and endeared and a little bit loving the attention all at once.</p>\n<p>When Wade finally settles down, he sits on Peter\u2019s couch and opens a food delivery app. Apparently, he already has Peter\u2019s address memorized just by walking inside his apartment.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t know why he says it. Maybe all the excitement got to him. But when he sits next to Wade on the couch, he\u2019s feeling bold.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything else you know about me?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Wade says, distracted. \u201cDunno off the top of my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sinks into the couch, letting the cheap cushions and horrible springs drag him toward the dip Wade\u2019s created by sitting on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says simply.</p>\n<p>Wade clicks the order button. Then he cocks his head. \u201cWait. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it something specific?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA little,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade starts bouncing his knee. He doesn\u2019t like being left out. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a little personal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s knee starts bouncing harder. \u201cWhat is it, Pete?\u201d he says. A little thrill shoots through Peter. He likes hearing his name in Wade\u2019s voice. Really likes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to figure it out on your own,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>Wade whines, both of his knees bouncing now. But he doesn\u2019t argue. He doesn\u2019t press for information. He just falls silent, probably thinking hard.</p>\n<p>The food Wade ordered shows up a little while later and they eat together, chatting idly, but Peter can tell Wade\u2019s mind isn\u2019t fully on the conversation. Afterward, Peter changes and they leave through the window to patrol, but Wade is similarly distracted the whole night. Peter feels a little bad for teasing him like this, but he also isn\u2019t feeling quite brave enough to just announce it, either.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I like you. Like. A lot.</em>\n</p>\n<p>They part ways at the end of the night and Peter falls asleep with a grin, wondering if Wade will figure it out.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the sound of the window sliding open that wakes him up.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes snap open, landing on his alarm clock, which informs him that it\u2019s almost three in the morning. He stiffens for half a second, panicking, before he recognizes the creak of leather and Kevlar. <em>Wade</em>.</p>\n<p>The bed bounces as Wade collapses into it, having crawled through the wrong window.</p>\n<p>\u201cPete,\u201d Wade whispers. \u201cHey. Petey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWade,\u201d Peter murmurs, his voice rough with sleep. Wade groans, probably from the sound of Peter\u2019s voice. Maybe because of Peter saying his name. He doesn\u2019t say it very often, for reasons he\u2019s still not entirely sure about. Maybe it\u2019s because he thought of him as <em>Deadpool</em>\u00a0for so long that it felt weird to start calling him by his name. Maybe it\u2019s because it didn\u2019t seem fair, somehow, to call him Wade when he had no idea what Peter\u2019s name was. Or maybe he was afraid that all his feelings would be readily apparent if he uttered that single syllable.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry for waking you up,\u201d Wade says, still whispering. He scoots closer, wrapping an arm around Peter and pulling him backwards, so that Peter is pressed against the hard line of his body. Peter pretends that his face isn\u2019t on fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like me?\u201d Wade says. His voice is different. Hesitant. Peter realizes that Wade\u2019s entire body is stiff.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter hedges. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade groans. \u201cPlease throw me a bone here, Webs,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I could never tell. It\u2019s what I <em>want</em>, so of course\u2014 I mean\u2014 anything I noticed, I probably made up. Or I was just seeing it the way I wanted to see it. You know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter slips his hand into Wade\u2019s, intertwining their fingers, so that both of their hands are resting on Peter\u2019s stomach. \u201cYes,\u201d Peter whispers. \u201cI like you. Really, really like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade yanks Peter by the hand and Peter rolls over with a squeak, facing Wade now. \u201cAnd I have for years,\u201d Peter adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Wade breathes. \u201cI\u2019m so happy right now. Shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughs. He scoots closer and wiggles one of his legs between Wade\u2019s, just wanting to be nearer to him. Touching more. Wade squeezes him even tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really want to kiss you,\u201d Wade says.</p>\n<p>Peter reaches up and pushes Wade\u2019s mask over his nose. Then he presses closer and slots their lips together, relaxing into Wade as he fists his hand in the back of Peter\u2019s shirt and holds him even tighter. Wade groans, chasing after Peter\u2019s mouth and extending the length of their kiss two different times when Peter goes to pull away. It only stops because Peter holds him back and bursts out laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to talk to you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe talk all the time,\u201d Wade says, grabbing Peter\u2019s hand and pressing a kiss against his palm, then the inside of his wrist. \u201cWe can talk later. Right now, I wanna find out what your molars taste like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter wheezes, helplessly trying to hold Wade off as he stubbornly rolls closer. \u201cWade!\u201d he gasps, giggling as, somehow, it turns into a wrestling session. If wrestling included your opponent trying to kiss every inch of your bare skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove that,\u201d Wade growls. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you say my name more often, baby boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Peter says. Wade finally succeeds in pinning Peter\u2019s wrists above his head and then they\u2019re kissing again. Wade makes good on his promise to explore Peter\u2019s mouth and Peter stops trying to have a conversation with him, giving in to the impromptu make out session.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all kinds of kissing. Fast and hard. Soft and slow. Peter doesn\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been by the time they finally stop, but he\u2019s laying on top of Wade and Wade\u2019s hands are on his butt and he swears his lips are swollen from kissing.</p>\n<p>They fall asleep like that, completely on accident and in the middle of a conversation, to boot, but neither of them wanted to stop talking. They stay tangled together all night, and when Peter wakes up, his first thought will be something along the lines of amazement, grateful that Wade is as observant as he is.</p>"
