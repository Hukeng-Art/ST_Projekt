  "text": "<p>Soho was the last place Crowley wanted to be, and yet, the one place he always seemed to end up.</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t anything for him here except a few hundred years\u2019 worth of memories, punctuated neatly with one so terrifically awful that it felt like a stab wound whenever it popped into his mind uninvited. Every inch of this block was layered in the ghosts of an angel.</p>\n<p>The street felt hollow without him, <i> like looking at where the furniture isn\u2019t. </i></p>\n<p>But here Crowley was, again, late at night so that he wouldn\u2019t catch Maggie\u2019s pitying gaze or Nina\u2019s regretful one. He didn\u2019t blame them for what happened, but he couldn\u2019t bare to look at them now, not now that they knew it was all over. Their advice had done something worse than not work.</p>\n<p>He glanced at his watch, dark and shiny and sleek- a manifestation of everything he wanted to convey about himself to the outer world. Aziraphale was the only one who saw something different there. Saw under it.</p>\n<p>It was 2:12 AM. All the shop lights were off.</p>\n<p>All except one.</p>\n<p>For one desperate, manic moment, Crowley thought Aziraphale had returned. The light on was the one the angel left when it was late but he was still reading. The figure under the light wore a cream tartan dressing gown, but their hair was dark and their skin olive. Not Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>Crowley stood there for a moment, thinking about his last time in that little shop. Thinking about the last time he\u2019d touched Aziraphale. They\u2019d kissed. The memory was like a block of ice.</p>\n<p>It hurt. It hurt to have the knowledge that Aziraphale\u2019s lips felt exactly as Crowley had expected. Every other facet of that moment was terribly different from what he had imagined.</p>\n<p>It was foolish to come down here. He gazed into the shop, desperately aware that he was only hurting himself by being so near it.</p>\n<p>In a moment of shock, he realized that he\u2019d been staring at the angel in the bookshop, and that the angel was now staring back.</p>\n<p>They looked at each other for a moment. Then, Muriel\u2019s face bloomed into a wide smile and they waved enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d murmured Crowley, turning away and walking down the street. The Bentley wasn\u2019t too far.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, wait! Hello!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley stopped, exhaling. He could hear the angel\u2019s feet pattering behind him and wanted to run, but he detected a note of sharp eagerness in their voice. Their loneliness was palpable even at a distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley? What are you doing out so late?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a demon, we\u2019re practically nocturnal.\u201d He turned to face them.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Are</i> you still a demon, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel\u2019s tone was entirely different than Aziraphale\u2019s had been, so long ago. Crowley didn\u2019t have the desire to respond with a quip now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d they replied, a little bemused. \u201cI thought if you <i>weren\u2019t</i> on Hell\u2019s side, it meant you were something else\u2026\u201d The angel trailed off, thinking. \u201cWell, it\u2019s lovely to see you again anyway! Would you like to come in? I\u2019ve got, um, whisky?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s eyebrows shot up. He was surprised to hear Muriel knew what whisky was, let alone that they had any. Then it hit him- the whisky was probably the bottle Aziraphale kept on hand for when Crowley was in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think- I don\u2019t-.\u201c Crowley\u2019s hands were up in front of his chest as he backed away slightly, as if he were talking down a gunman.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right. Of course. Sorry,\u201d Muriel replied, obviously crestfallen. \u201cSorry to interrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel turned to go back to the bookshop, leaving a sour feeling in Crowley\u2019s stomach. He knew all too well what it was like to be lonely on Earth. How much effort it took to belong there.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d he groaned, regretting it immediately.</p>\n<p>Muriel turned around with a dazzling smile. \u201cOh, yes, sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>He groaned once more, then stomped up to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you want to be my friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel\u2019s head tilted like a confused dog. \u201cUm, well, I don\u2019t know what to say! Why wouldn\u2019t I want to be your friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you? I\u2019m a demon, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled blankly back, as if they really couldn\u2019t understand the question. Crowley sighed. \u201cListen. I can\u2019t go in Az- in- in that shop, but I can sit on the stoop with you. If you\u2019re still offering whisky, that is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, silly,\u201d Muriel began, waving their hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m <i>inviting</i> you in, you have permission-\u201c</p>\n<p>Crowley growled. \u201cI don\u2019t need permission to go in there, but\u2026I just can\u2019t. Shall we drink or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel beamed. \u201cRight! Be right out!\u201d</p>\n<p>They eagerly trotted ahead, while Crowley took his time approaching the shop as though it could blow up.</p>\n<p>His mind wandered back to the fire. When he thought he lost Aziraphale. A painful lump in his throat appeared.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne whisky, coming up!\u201d Muriel nearly sang, clinking the bottle and two glasses as they stepped back onto the stoop.</p>\n<p>Crowley stared. \u201cYou\u2019re not drinking any, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Muriel smiled conspiratorially. \u201cI was thinking perhaps I ought to try some. They\u2019re always talking about alcohol in books. I\u2019m too nervous to drink it alone. I hear it can make you\u2026\u201d They swallowed cautiously, holding the bottle carefully as though not to upset it. \u201cDrunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSmart angel,\u201d Crowley murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s best not to drink alone if one can help it. That\u2019s a free Earth lesson for you.\u201d He began pouring the drinks. \u201cHave you ingested anything before, Muriel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, nothing yet.\u201d Muriel smiled trepidatiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re starting out with hard liquor in the company of a demon?\u201d Crowley finally laughed- it felt like ages since he had last done. There was mischief in the sound. \u201cPerhaps I misjudged you, Muriel. Cheers.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lifted his glass. Muriel did the same, not understanding they were meant to touch. Crowley clinked the glasses and tossed much of the drink into his mouth. Whisky was better savored, better sipped, but this was the closest he\u2019d been to the bookshop since that day. He needed some courage.</p>\n<p>He had, of course, forgotten that Muriel did not know how to properly drink whisky. They drank as much as Crowley did and swallowed slowly, their eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Crowley asked, amused. He\u2019d expected a little more reaction.</p>\n<p>Muriel shook their head. \u201cOh, no. Not at all, actually. It was worse than terrible.\u201d Crowley grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard such a poor review given so brightly. Here,\u201d he said with a snap. \u201cTry this instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Across the street, a small window in the front of the Drunken Donkey tinkled apart. A cup filled with a fizzy pink drink soared towards them and landed at Muriel\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it\u2026whisky?\u201d Muriel took the glass and studied it warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Shirley Temple. You\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a glance at Crowley that clearly said <i>I hope I can trust you </i>, they brought it to their lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrink it slower this time, it\u2019s bubbly,\u201d Crowley cautioned. \u201cAnd watch out for the cherries- those red round things. You\u2019ve got to chew those.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel obeyed, tipping the cup slightly and sipping slowly. Then, eyes full of confusion, they broke out into another massive smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, that is MUCH nicer!\u201d Muriel laughed. \u201cWhy does anyone drink whisky when Shrilly Tembles are available?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley smiled, a bit bitter this time. \u201cWhisky can make you feel less pain. Dulls the hurt. The taste starts to become nice when you\u2019ve had enough of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope I never need to drink whisky enough that I start to enjoy the taste,\u201d Muriel said, a bit frightened. They sipped more of their Shirley Temple and watched Crowley, who had fallen into another memory.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be your friend because you\u2019re good.\u201d The words came out of Muriel like a fact.</p>\n<p>Crowley looked at them. \u201cHow could you possibly know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Muriel began in an almost business-like tone. \u201cI\u2019ve read nearly all the books in the shop. It hasn\u2019t taken too long, you see; scriveners like I was are required to read quickly. Lots of texts in Heaven to refer to. Lots of records. When there aren\u2019t many angels around to talk to, you get good at reading quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what does that have to do with me being good or not?\u201d Crowley said, dumbfounded if not impressed. Muriel hadn\u2019t been in the shop long. There were thousands of books there.</p>\n<p>\u201cI read the books about you,\u201d Muriel said matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>Crowley wasn\u2019t following. \u201cThe books about me? The ones that talk about me and the other demons falling out of heaven?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, I did read those. But I meant the ones about you and Aziraphale. The letter books to Aziraphale\u2019s friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>As far as Crowley knew, Aziraphale had many passing acquaintances throughout the millennia, but none he wrote books of letters to.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, his friend Diary? You must know them. They must be an angel, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met them before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley coughed heavily. \u201cYou\u2019ve read Aziraphale\u2019s diary?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel looked completely perplexed.</p>\n<p>Crowley spoke fast. \u201cCan you bring it out here? The book full of letters to\u2026Diary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a LOT of them,\u201d Muriel replied. \u201cWhich one do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley considered this. \u201cI guess whatever one is about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel didn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of them are about you. Can you maybe be a little more specific, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>He groaned in frustration. \u201cWell, gah! What do they say, then?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel got a funny look on their face. \u201cHaven\u2019t you read the books? If I was in a book, I\u2019d read it all the time!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Muriel, books with the words \u201cdear diary\u201d in them do tend to be private.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel blanched, setting down their cup. \u201cYou mean I shouldn\u2019t have read them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you should not have,\u201d Crowley laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh, I\u2019ve probably, oh, upset the new supreme archangel? Already?\u201dMuriel wrung their hands fretfully. Crowley pitied them.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. Don\u2019t worry about it. The Supreme Archangel of all Heaven has moved on from this life. He doesn\u2019t care about the earth or what\u2019s in it.\u201d Crowley heard the bitterness in his voice and took another swig. \u201cHe left those books behind. Besides, I won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel did not look placated. Instead, they looked frightfully concerned.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, their eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you\u2026trying to trick me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrick you? Course not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not as easily fooled now, you know. These books have taught me a lot. I know about orcs now, and the virtues of tilling the land, and, and- oral sex, and how to bake souffl\u00e9s!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley choked on his whisky.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need to be yelling about that!\u201d He cried, shushing Muriel. \u201cThe- the oral thing, not the souffl\u00e9s\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I mean is that I\u2019m not as easily tricked. You can\u2019t just say something untrue and get away with it anymore.\u201d They straightened their back proudly, accidentally grabbing their whisky cup instead of their Shirley Temple. \u201cI\u2019m not so naive.\u201d They took a swig and choked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat untrue thing did I say?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was rising indignantly. He was a demon, he did lie, but he hadn\u2019t then.</p>\n<p>Muriel wheezed through the alcohol burning their throat and it occurred to Crowley that Muriel did not know how to spit. \u201cYou said Aziraphale didn\u2019t care about the earth or anything on it, but you\u2019re on the earth and he cares about you more than anything. You\u2019re all he ever talks about in those letters. I think he tries to make that Diary person jealous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley didn\u2019t want to hear it, not from Muriel and not with Muriel\u2019s light manner. Muriel didn\u2019t understand the weight of the message they were delivering</p>\n<p>But Crowley couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cWhat did Aziraphale say? To..to Diary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know, just all the nice things you do for people and animals all the time even though hell would punish you for it if they knew. And especially the nice things you do for Aziraphale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel paused.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd also about how you look in your \u2018sharp clothes.\u2019 I could do with a lot less description of your outfits, if I\u2019m honest. Totally breaks focus from the narrative, reading six paragraphs about your outfit of the day.\u201c</p>\n<p>Crowley started to speak, but words failed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat reminds me! Would you please stand up for just a moment?\u201d Muriel looked up at Crowley with a curious, clinical innocence, like a child observing a bug. \u201cAnd lift up the back of your jacket, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, what for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to understand what Aziraphale means by \u2018spectacular buttocks\u2019. The words don\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say that!!\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange thing to say, right? Well, aren\u2019t you going to stand?\u201d</p>\n<p><i>\u201cNo, I bloody well won\u2019t!\u201d</i> Crowley blushed scarlet and pulled his jacket tight around him. Muriel sighed, a hint of annoyance in their breath.</p>\n<p>They sat quietly for a moment. \u201cDid he say anything else\u2026not about my Earthly appearance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure! He loves you more than any other being. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not including God in that group, of course.\u201d Muriel giggled.</p>\n<p>Crowley really didn\u2019t need to hear this. Not from Muriel and their buoyant giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, could you show me-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course! Come on in.\u201d Muriel started to stand, but stopped when they notice Crowley hadn\u2019t moved.</p>\n<p>He looked up at them behind the dark glasses, voice somehow gruff and fragile at once. \u201cI- I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel considered him for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a deal. You tell me who Diary is, and I\u2019ll bring out either the first or the last book, whichever you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley took one final drink, polishing off the glass. \u201cDiary isn\u2019t anyone, the book itself is called Diary. Diaries are meant for the author\u2019s eyes only, typically. It\u2019s a record of one\u2019s life and their feelings. Very silly things to have. You write as if you\u2019re talking to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>In this moment, Crowley felt like Aziraphale\u2019s diary would be the least silly thing in the world to have.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it sounds brilliant,\u201d Muriel breathed. \u201cA record\u2026but about yourself? That you talk to like a friend, even if you don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, Muriel looked embarrassed, so they scuttled off to get one of the books before racing back.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, um, which one should I get, Crowley?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe, uh, the\u2026most recent.\u201d His heart seemed to be burning. He was about as nervous as he\u2019d ever been. It was like preparing to ask Aziraphale to be with him again.</p>\n<p>Muriel came back with a handsome, leather-bound book, and passed it to Crowley.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll need time to read that privately, won\u2019t you?\u201d Muriel said, at almost a whisper, the happy tone of their voice rather tinny.</p>\n<p>Crowley looked at them. \u201cMuriel, it\u2019s nothing personal. I just can\u2019t go in that shop. It\u2019s too- too much for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a lot of memories there.\u201d Muriel said softly, sounding far less naive than usual. \u201cI\u2019m sure it hurts when\u2026when he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley grunted, feeling like the cold, empty glass in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHurts knowing why he left,\u201d Crowley muttered. \u201cThat he even could.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled sadly. \u201cI\u2019m surprised myself. He talks a lot about how glad he is to be here, how he never wants to lose this place. But I suppose it\u2019s easier to save the world if you\u2019re the one holding the nuclear codes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley could only stare at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I, I read all about the Cold War,\u201d Muriel explained awkwardly. They reached toward the leather book. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley passed the diary back to them, fearful he might not get it back. Every book in the shop had been handled by Aziraphale, but these diaries felt like him. His hands slid across the pages once. It was the closest thing to touching the angel he would likely ever get again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh! Here\u2019s the section. One of my favorite parts!\u201d Muriel\u2019s index finger was halfway down a page near the start of the diary, and started to read aloud.</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cOctober 18th,</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Dear Diary,</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The most marvelous thing happened today, and I must admit even I never saw it coming. That I, who knows Crowley better than anyone, and certainly longer than nearly anyone, could still find myself surprised by him speaks to the many joys of living here on Earth. It never fails to amaze. He never ceases to amaze.\u201d </i>\n</p>\n<p>Crowley had gone very still. Muriel continued.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>It was, by all measures, a perfectly splendid Autumn day. The air was crisp enough to require layering, so Crowley was wearing a dark turtleneck-</i> do you mind if I skip this part? These sections make me feel\u2026funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley cleared his throat hurriedly and nodded, his hand gesturing more wildly than he\u2019d intended.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Muriel exhaled with relief.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>We sat at the benches facing the pond, my Crowley to my left, as always. Some children nearby were tossing bits of food to the ducks. One looked over her shoulder and spotted us. I had never seen this child before, but she approached with a skip in her step and a smile on her face. Vainly, I assumed she was attracted by the angelic goodness I tend to exude, but when she arrived at our bench, she spoke to Crowley instead.</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>I remember you, she exclaimed. Look what we brought for the ducks!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>She held open a brown paper bag full of peas. Dear, sweet Crowley smiled in response and commended the child before sending her off to her mother again.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>What on earth was that? I asked, and I tell you, I could not have prepared myself for the answer.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Crowley said \u2018I saw them a week or so back. They were feeding the ducks rice- it\u2019s probably the worst thing you can feed a duck, you know. So I told them to try frozen peas. Ducks love them and they won\u2019t make their insides explode.\u2019</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>He said it so casually, but my heart seemed likely to explode itself. Crowley has always been kind to children, but in all our years, I\u2019d never seen him teaching any how to be kinder.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Of course, shortly after, Crowley scolded me for staring at him and threatened to cause mischief of some kind if I didn\u2019t cease praising him at once. What he fails to understand, of course, is that I am constantly trying very hard not to compliment him. It is dreadfully difficult to be near the sole source of my joy and be tight-lipped about his endless charms. One could forgive me for not always succeeding.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Maybe someday I will be able to lavish him with the praise he deserves and he will accept it. I pray for it- and I suspect the Almighty listens, for despite his protestations, my Crowley seems to perk up ever so slightly whenever I pay him a well-deserved compliment.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>Muriel closed the book happily. \u201cSee?\u201d They said, as though they\u2019d won a debate.</p>\n<p>The words meant very much to Crowley, though they didn\u2019t fix anything. They hurt as much as they helped.</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember those ducks,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThose kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>He needed a moment to collect himself. He needed time to read more. He was still so furious with the angel, but the diary was the closest thing he had to Aziraphale. He wanted that \u201cus time\u201d so desperately. This was, tragically, the next best option.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, I think I\u2019d better-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Muriel passed the book back. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished, I\u2019ll trade you for another one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley nodded. \u201cTh-thanks, Muriel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and Crowley? What are peas? And where are the ducks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Crowley said, standing up. \u201cWhen I come back to trade for another volume, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled widely, clapping softly. \u201cOh yes! Thank you, Crowley!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d he replied, and took off down the bookshop steps. With a grin and a shake of his head, he lifted the back of his jacket up and struck his hip out to the side. He looked over his shoulder at Muriel. \u201cTa-ta, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d Muriel said appreciatively, staring directly at Crowley\u2019s arse with all the desirous energy of a postage stamp. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I still don\u2019t understand, really. No offense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnew you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Crowley laughed openly, enjoying the feeling. \u201cNever change, Muriel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, okay.\u201d Muriel smiled and waved before turning into the shop.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t want to get their hopes up, but tonight felt\u2026different. Tonight felt like, perhaps, something have fallen into place. Perhaps Muriel had found themselves a friend, a \u201cdrinking buddy\u201d, a \u201cwing-<s>man</s> them\u201d. They had the wings for it, after all.</p>\n<p>They checked to be sure the demon had left the block. Somewhere, they could hear the engine of an old car sputter to life and speed away.</p>\n<p>Muriel approached the gateway, arms full of electric candles, and activated it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs anyone there?\u201d They whispered nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Muriel,\u201d the Metatron said. \u201cI\u2019ll connect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s face appeared. \u201cGood evening, Muriel, isn\u2019t it a bit late for you? Is everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyes looked heavy. He reached towards a bowtie that wasn\u2019t there and settled for smoothing out the new tie Heaven had him wearing. His suit was fine, fancy, sharp and starchy. He desperately missed his old one.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, sorry. Just wanted to let you know I gave him that book you asked me to give him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale smiled, relieved. \u201cJolly good work, my dear.\u201d Aziraphale paused, his voice trembling almost imperceptibly. \u201cDid he look well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, his corporation looked fine, but his expressions\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, of course,\u201d Aziraphale replied dully.</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale? May I ask a question?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel gulped. \u201cWhat does \u2018spectacular buttocks\u2019 mean? I asked Crowley but I don\u2019t really understand what he showed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShowed you?\u201d Aziraphale spluttered. \u201cOh- I- dreadfully sorry, Muriel dear, but something\u2019s come up- I must, uh, I must go. Goodbye now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The gateway closed abruptly.</p>\n<p>Muriel stared at it for a few moments, then giggled to themselves.</p>\n<p>They were still learning, and many things didn\u2019t make sense here on Earth. However, if these books taught them anything, it was that jealousy was a very powerful motivational tool when bringing split lovers back together.</p>\n<p>Muriel had already been thinking it, even before Crowley had come by. But now that they were almost friends, it was decided: Muriel would be the best wingthem ever. They weren\u2019t so naive anymore, after all.</p>\n<p>Crowley read the dairy again and again. He read it at least six times before even considering trading it back with Muriel. It felt like a sacred text. Like a blessing bound in leather.</p>\n<p>It was for that reason he was unable to just return and get another one right away. Muriel wouldn\u2019t have minded if he had, of course. They wouldn\u2019t have judged how quickly he\u2019d devoured the book because Muriel would\u2019ve had nothing to compare his behavior to. Wouldn\u2019t know it was desperate or odd or worthy of derision.</p>\n<p>He paced the apartment, running his hands through his hair and sighing. The flat was his again, but he didn\u2019t like it much. It no longer felt like home. Shax\u2019s interior decorating instincts were very different from his. Rather more slime than he\u2019d left it. Rather more wall-licking than he liked.</p>\n<p>A few miracles got the place cleaned up, but Aziraphale\u2019s voice echoed in his head. <i> I would always know the stain was there. Underneath.</i></p>\n<p>He hated when Aziraphale was right, especially now after Aziraphale had been so wrong. The diary had proven at least that much.</p>\n<p>The diary. It seemed filled with its own sort of divine energy. Like moonlight\u2019s distillation of the sun, Crowley could feel Aziraphale in the pages.</p>\n<p>At first, Crowley started reading it with bitterness, disdain. At the first mention of his own name, he slammed the book shut and downed another glass of whisky. He glared at it from across the room and thought maybe he ought to light it aflame along with the rest of his memories of the angel. Perhaps the entire flat.</p>\n<p>But, of course, he did not. He drunkenly hissed and growled at the book and its infuriating author, but the closest he got to inflicting any actual damage was dog-earing the corner of a page containing a particularly wonderful passage about himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake that,\u201d he whispered, bending the corner down, knowing how his angel hated dog-earing. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley believed it very unfortunate that each and every thought the angel committed to the page reminded Crowley why his heart beat for Aziraphale, even after all this time and all this damage. Aziraphale seemed to spend every day looking for reasons to love the world. If the diary was to be trusted, it <i> appeared</i> he found what he was searching for in Crowley.</p>\n<p>The diary left Crowley\u2019s mind swimming- a memory breached. <i> You idiot. We could have been us.</i></p>\n<p>Instead, here he was in a grey room that smelled of Shax and whisky bottles. And Aziraphale was somewhere appallingly bright and unbearably far, and perhaps they would never speak to each other again. Breathing came fast and panicked.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t bear another moment in the flat. He grabbed the diary and within moments was in the Bentley. Traveling, as always, towards Soho, as if he might find his heart there again. It was a hopeless feeling.</p>\n<p>He sped through the streets, shops passing nearly too quickly for him to make out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, wait,\u201d he muttered to the car, who obediently screeched to a hard stop. Parking in a space that stretched to accommodate them, Crowley dashed out of the Bentley and into a fine stationary shop. He felt it was only right to give Muriel something in exchange for their assistance the other night, even if they didn\u2019t know just how important that diary was. That was habit, wasn\u2019t it? Tit-for-tat was how he and Aziraphale had always operated.</p>\n<p>Not that Crowley was looking for a new Aziraphale. He didn\u2019t want one. He couldn\u2019t possibly find one even if he did want a replacement; he was sure that Aziraphale was the finest of all <i>her</i> creations and strongly suspected that knowing the angel at all had been a divine curse. He had had his fill of that static. But he couldn\u2019t help wonder how hard it had been for Muriel, spending the last 6,000 years without an Aziraphale of their own.</p>\n<p>By Crowley\u2019s account, what he and Muriel had in common was that neither had a single friend. Why shouldn\u2019t they be friendless together?</p>\n<p>He was out of the shop again very quickly, a brown bag slung over his arm. He placed it in the seat beside him where a plastic baggy full of frozen peas sat, condensation dripping threateningly in the direction of the Bentley\u2019s fine leather upholstery.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will NOT DRIP ON MY LEATHER,\u201d Crowley snapped. Any water that had considered dripping seemed to freeze in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d he growled.</p>\n<p>In a shockingly small amount of time later, Crowley parked across from the bookshop. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the shop would be empty. No one would know why, of course, no one except Crowley. A few decades prior, Aziraphale had miracled Tuesdays in the shop to be especially, perpetually, vacant. They had often spent Tuesdays together.</p>\n<p>Crowley approached the door and found it slightly ajar as if to welcome customers. He hesitated there on the stoop. He could just knock, he assured himself. He didn\u2019t have to enter.</p>\n<p>He rapped on the window. \u201cOi, Inspector Constable?\u201d He called into the shop. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p>\n<p>With enthusiasm nearly indecent in its intensity, Muriel popped up from behind a shelf, wearing a white, short-sleeved button-up shirt, tan slacks, and white sneakers. Crowley thought it was a perfectly acceptable getup for a bookseller. He flashed them an approving thumbs up when they approached the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d Muriel said, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re back! Come in, come in!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026no, I won\u2019t be doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no?\u201d Muriel looked disappointed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied sternly. \u201cBut I did bring a few things by. Any customers in?\u201d He knew the answer, but he peered in anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no. No one seems to want to come in. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve done wrong.\u201d Muriel chewed their lip fretfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cA mystery,\u201d Crowley couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cHere you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tossed the bag to Muriel. Their mouth fell open.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t- it\u2019s not-for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeeeep.\u201d Crowley put his hands in his pockets and rocked on his feet, feeling more than a bit awkward.</p>\n<p>With a trembling hand, Muriel reached into the bag and pulled out a light blue, cloth-bound book. Lovely gold letters emblazoned across the front read DIARY.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my! It\u2019s perfect.\u201d Muriel breathed, awestruck. They raced to Crowley, smiling wildly, before their face fell. \u201cIt actually is perfect!\u201d</p>\n<p>Completely perplexed, Crowley found himself patting the shoulder of a weeping angel.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for all that, now. I kept the receipt if you\u2019d like it,\u201d he murmured, sounding annoyed but feeling differently.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a receipt?\u201d Muriel hiccuped.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so you can give the diary back to the store I bought it from, get some money back, and buy something you\u2019d actually like with it. Perhaps another costume? You might try impersonating a doctor next.\u201d He smiled.</p>\n<p>Muriel clutched the diary as though it was their baby. \u201cI could never! It\u2019s the second gift I\u2019ve ever been given. I love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley groaned at Muriel\u2019s earnestness. \u201cThen what are you crying for? Quit it now and lock up. I told you we would go look at ducks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded, pulling a large key out of their pocket. \u201cBut what if a customer wants to buy a book?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, they won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>They took off down the street together.</p>\n<p>Crowley knew he ought to not care, but he couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t actually been selling any books, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel blushed, looking a little ashamed. \u201cNot yet, but I\u2019m sure I will if I-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cA bit of advice for you, Scrivener. If you want to stay in the good graces of your new boss, you won\u2019t let a single book leave that shop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel looked at Crowley, stricken. \u201cEven the diary book I sent you off with?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Crowley\u2019s turn to feel uncomfortable, like the butt of a joke. \u201cWell, except those. I\u2019ll bring those back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Muriel exhaled with relief. \u201cDid you finish it yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley grunted noncommittally, taking care to step on a leaf just to focus on the crunch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d see you much sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been four days.\u201d Crowley wasn\u2019t sure why he sounded defensive.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was expecting you back the same night. Are you a slow reader? I finished The Crow Road the same day you gave it to me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley glared at them. There was no reason to admit that he had finished the diary that night OR that he fought himself not to return to the shop immediately for the next unread volume.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was busy,\u201d he snarled.</p>\n<p>The rest of the walk to the park was as pleasant as a walk with a veritable infant could be. Sure, Muriel wasn\u2019t crying again, but they did seem entirely enchanted by nearly everything they passed. From pay-to-use loos to overburdened dog walkers, everything elicited squeaks of excitement from the scrivener.</p>\n<p>It was actually a welcome distraction. Crowley\u2019s mind was overlaying memories of his walks with Aziraphale over the current scenes before him. This square of pavement is where Aziraphale told Crowley off for frightening some rude teenagers back in \u201882 (1982, that is). That streetlamp lit up far too brightly when Aziraphale had drunkenly tried to light it, Christmas Eve of 1799. Well, perhaps it wasn\u2019t the same one, but it was in the same place, anyway. The locals had called it a miracle, not knowing how right they were.</p>\n<p>And of course, that bench. Their bench. Facing the pond and the ducks. Where Crowley sat with Aziraphale on his right. Always.</p>\n<p>Crowley avoided the bench and instead stood near the pond\u2019s edge. \u201cDucks,\u201d he said to Muriel, indicating them with little enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Muriel made up for it ten times over at least. They pulled the peas out from the baggie Crowley had brought with him, tossing them one at a time at the various appreciative if not demanding, waterfowl, and clapping excitedly whenever one snapped it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve only read about them, this is amazing! Crowley,\u201d they gasped suddenly, grabbing his arm and pointing as though they\u2019d seen a celebrity. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t be a goose, could it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley peered at the large old bird. \u201cKeep your distance. Geese are crotchety buggers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, I know!\u201d Muriel said completely thrilled, trotting over to the goose to get a closer look.</p>\n<p>Muriel seemed to have a gift. They soon found themselves surrounded by squawking birds. And for the better part of an hour, chose to remain a member of the flock while Crowley observed the park goers from a distance, flipping through the diary he\u2019d been mostly unable to set down for days.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, young Mr. Duck, the pea is all gone!\u201d He heard Muriel say to the latest addition to their posse.</p>\n<p>\u201cPea<b>s</b>, scrivener,\u201d Crowley corrected.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, of course! Sorry.\u201d Muriel turned back to the duck, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll come back again soon. You have my word as an-.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley looked up sharply from the diary and cleared his throat with a warning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs an- an- animal lover,\u201d Muriel finished, glancing at Crowley for reassurance. He just nodded.</p>\n<p>What Heaven was thinking, sending this being down without any proper guidance or training, Crowley didn\u2019t know. A worried voice in the back of his mind wondered if Heaven didn\u2019t particularly care if mortals found them out, this late into the Great Plan. He was well aware that Armageddon was very much still a topic of discussion among the higher-ups.</p>\n<p>His eyes fell on Muriel, who was looking up at the duck, then down at their lap, then back at the duck so quickly it appeared the angel had glitched. Crowley stepped forward to see Muriel\u2019s blue diary in their lap. Gracing the first page, Muriel had sketched a likeness of a duck.</p>\n<p>They were adding small details to the beak when Crowley\u2019s shadow passed over the book. Muriel slammed it shut with a gasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice doodle,\u201d he commented.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, thank you. I\u2019ve actually, uh, never done that. Only ever wrote words. Never actually had anything to doodle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd are you enjoying it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels better than recording,\u201d Muriel whispered quickly, as though someone would be angry at them for turning the thought into sound.</p>\n<p>Crowley let himself smile. \u201cI like making things too. Been a while, but I understand the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made stars, right? Before\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley could\u2019ve scowled, but chose not to. \u201cThat I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be very proud,\u201d Muriel said with a smile. \u201cHumans all <i> love</i> the stars. Practically every book talks about them, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley nodded. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of books, remember that part in the diary where-\u201c</p>\n<p>Crowley held up a hand. \u201cGotta stop you there, Constable. I really- I can\u2019t- let\u2019s agree to keep those diary entries quiet. You never know who might be listening. Ducks have ears, after all. Wouldn\u2019t want your boss\u2019s secrets in the wrong hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Muriel peered at the ducks. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, they\u2019re there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould a duck\u2026do\u2026something with secrets?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter not to find out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded in solemn agreement. They returned to their sketch with eyes narrowed, glancing at the ducks around them with heavy scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The last thing Crowley wanted was to discuss the holy pages of Aziraphale\u2019s scriptures, many of which featured Crowley very prominently, with Muriel. He may have had demonic proclivities, but such a book club was, conceptually, far too twisted for even him.</p>\n<p>Some time later, they returned to the shop much in the same fashion as they\u2019d left it; Muriel chattered at every mundane thing they saw and Crowley tried to think of anything but Aziraphale and failed miserably.</p>\n<p>Once at the shop, Muriel darted inside, taking the most recent diary with them. The moment it left Crowley\u2019s hands, he\u2019d wanted to beg for it back.</p>\n<p>They returned with a new volume, the second-most recent diary. This one had colorful papers sticking out from it. Muriel held it in front of them as if it was the happiest they\u2019d ever been.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPost It notes!\u201d Muriel announced, anticipating the question. \u201cIndicating all my favorite sections.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley groaned. This really did feel like a book club now. He felt suddenly uncomfortable reading the diary at all. But, he was a (sort of) demon, wasn\u2019t he? Ethics needn\u2019t apply.</p>\n<p>Unlike the last, this book was full. Curious, Crowley flipped to a page marked by a yellow rectangle poking out the side.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a diary entry at all. It was a sketch. Of him. Of <i> many</i> hims.</p>\n<p>In one corner, Aziraphale had drawn Crowley from the shoulders up, in profile. His mouth was neutral. It reminded Crowley of art he\u2019d seen back in the old days, somewhere in Greece.</p>\n<p>Just under that, Crowley was stretched out, limbs spilling over the sides of what was clearly Aziraphale\u2019s chair. His head was thrown back, exposing his neck, a wine glass looking irresponsibly loose in his hand.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the page, eyes. Just eyes, tender eyes, with pupil slits.</p>\n<p>Beneath that, a pink sticky note concealed a part of the page. Crowley pulled it up. He gaped, astonished to find a sketch of his backside and upper thighs in some very tight jeans.</p>\n<p>Muriel coughed beside him and looked away with an embarrassed \u201csorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley was tempted to linger on the arse sketch, but just under it, two hands sat next to each other. One was thicker, wearing a golden pinky ring. The other was somewhat longer and more slender, the nails a bit sharper. The hands were nearly touching.</p>\n<p>Below that, a lanky Crowley, spreading far too much of his body across a park bench, looking to his left. Legs wide, arms draped across the back. An alert expression behind his dark glasses. Tightness in his jaw.</p>\n<p>The largest sketch by far was in the center. It was Crowley, seated at a table he knew to be at the Ritz. His eyes peered ever so fractionally over the tops of his dark glasses, and he held a wine glass aloft in a toast. His eyes looked warm, they looked loving. The Crowley in the drawing was smiling.</p>\n<p>The Crowley holding the diary was not. He battled the tears invading his eyes, willing them not to fall. He could not let Muriel see.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, he felt the warm pressure of a small palm against his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere, there,\u201d Muriel said, patting him. \u201cLovely doodles, aren\u2019t they? Who knew Aziraphale was such an artist! Really captured your good side.\u201d They blanched for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the, uh, bottom drawing!\u201d</p>\n<p>The <i>intended</i> double-meaning wasn\u2019t lost to Crowley. He glanced at Muriel, feeling again like perhaps he had misjudged them. He cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a bit\u2026this is a bit too,\u201d the words caught in his throat and he growled. \u201cFuck it, I need a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel gestured towards the shop door. \u201cI\u2019ve got more whisky inside, if you-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, can\u2019t. Let\u2019s go to the pub.\u201d In an instant, Crowley\u2019s swagger had returned to his legs and hips. If he could will plants to grow better and keep a burning car intact, surely he could do the same to himself. Tonight, he\u2019d drink, and tomorrow, alone, he\u2019d read the diary without an audience.</p>\n<p>Muriel trotted after him, stopping at the pub\u2019s entrance to examine a small bit of cardboard that was taped over the window Crowley broke when summoning Muriel\u2019s drink. Crowley noticed Muriel staring, and, with a few soft gestures, the glass was healed and the cardboard fell away. </p>\n<p>\u201cUsual order for you, Inspector?\u201d Crowley called over to them. Without waiting for an answer, Crowley asked the bartender for a Shirley Temple and a red wine.</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled. It was fair to say that the sketches had made an impact on Crowley, but also hadn\u2019t ruined his night. That was good. That was very good. Sure, he still wouldn\u2019t enter the bookshop, but Muriel knew they could convince him to soon.</p>\n<p>And Muriel reported as much, a few hours after a sodden Crowley sauntered off into the night, cursing Aziraphale while cradling the diary in his arms like a protective lover. Aziraphale listened as Muriel recounted the day, anxiety in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten about those sketches,\u201d he admitted. \u201cDreadfully tawdry,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, not at all!\u201d Muriel protested. \u201cThey\u2019re lovely!\u201d</p>\n<p>They both cleared their throats- one of the drawings at the forefront of both of their minds.</p>\n<p>Muriel, of course, did not feel anything towards Crowley but friendship. They knew about romance and desire from books, but (happily) felt no such feelings themselves, for Crowley, his arse, or anyone else.</p>\n<p>But the Supreme Archangel didn\u2019t need to know that. Not yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took him longer to read the last diary than I expected,\u201d Aziraphale admitted, running his necktie through his fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Muriel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, this?\u201d Muriel held up a meat pie from the pub. \u201cI was thinking about trying food today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gazed at the pie with a look of longing. \u201cYou ought to, those are splendid. Pair it with a chianti, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t care much for alcohol. I\u2019ll be having a Shirley Temb- I mean, Tem<i>p</i>le with extra grenadine.\u201d Muriel bounced on their feet at that and something in Aziraphale broke.</p>\n<p>\u201cA Shirley Temple, you say?\u201d He reminded himself it was not becoming for the Supreme Archangel of all Heaven to pass judgement. \u201cLovely,\u201d he said, trying not to grit his teeth. \u201cBut what\u2019s that book beside you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel held up the blue diary, which had been sitting ostentatiously beside Muriel on a table. \u201cA gift! Crowley brought it over for me. It\u2019s a diary of my own!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s smile faltered. \u201cCrowley- he gave you that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did indeed! Look, I\u2019ve already drawn a duck!\u201d Muriel held up the sketch proudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery nice, Muriel.\u201d Aziraphale stared at the book, his expression seeming to mean many things at once. Love. Pride. Longing. Jealousy\u2026</p>\n<p>Now was the time to strike.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d better get going, Supreme Archangel, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Aziraphale</i> is fine, Muriel, as I\u2019ve told you. Busy day tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, I\u2019ve got a new strategy to sell some books, since I had no customers today,\u201d they began.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh that\u2018s nice- wait,\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s patronizing smile was quickly swapped with a look of horror. \u201cSell-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh oh! Gotta go! A mortal\u2019s at the window, I think they need something!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale closed his mouth, looking a bit more than desperate, and the gateway closed abruptly.</p>\n<p>There was no mortal at the window, but Muriel knew Aziraphale had fudged the truth here and there when needed. Muriel needed Crowley to enter the bookshop again, and Muriel needed Aziraphale to return to it, and not just as a floating head. They needed Aziraphale back in a fully-corporated, fully kissable form. They thought a lovesick Crowley would be enough, but meat pies and the threat of bookselling might be the straw to break the camel\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>It occurred to Muriel suddenly that this might, by some definitions, be considered torture.</p>\n<p>Okay, so maybe their methods were a bit messy, Muriel reflected, returning to their duck sketch to add shading. But hey, they\u2019d never done this before.</p>\n<p>Had anyone?</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gazed at the spot where the bookshop flickered and disappeared just moments ago. For a breath, it almost felt like he was back there. He could almost smell the books, almost taste the tea he would\u2019ve been drinking at this time of night, had he been there. He missed everything about it.</p>\n<p>Heaven took a great deal getting used to. No books here, for a start. No coffee shops or restaurants. No (desperately needed) light dimmers. No diaries to speak of. No demons whatsoever.</p>\n<p>After six thousand years, what had once been a paradise felt rather more like walking into a toothpaste commercial. Everything was a brighter white than necessary. Unnatural. Cold in a sparkly, tingly way.</p>\n<p>It threatened a headache, so Aziraphale miracled a seat and sank into it, longing for his old red chair with the delicately carved details, that often sported a darkly-clad demon on its wooden arm.</p>\n<p>His eyes narrowed. For all he knew, Muriel was going to sell that chair, too. Maybe they already had!</p>\n<p>He groaned plaintively.</p>\n<p>Muriel. The angel reminded Aziraphale of himself, or a version of himself he hadn\u2019t been for a few thousand years. That bothered him. He didn\u2019t need Muriel reminding anyone <i> else</i> of a younger, arguably better, Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>It had, after all, taken Aziraphale and Crowley a few thousand years before they had drinks together, hadn\u2019t it? It had taken Muriel and Crowley a few weeks at best to reach that milestone.</p>\n<p>Plus, anyone could see that Muriel was far less stuffy than him\u2026</p>\n<p>Shax\u2019s voice echoed in his head. <i> I'm a little bemused as to why Crowley should risk destruction for you. You don't seem his type at all.</i></p>\n<p>Was Aziraphale an outlier, or was there something about overly-optimistic angel types in general that got Crowley\u2019s heart racing?</p>\n<p>Aziraphale scoffed, realizing how very silly he was being. He had nothing to worry about and he wasn\u2019t being replaced. They were in the middle of a spat, that\u2019s all it was. They\u2019d had spats before. If anything, he and Crowley always ended up closer afterwards.</p>\n<p>By that logic, really, this whole mess was actually quite a good thing. Yes, when they eventually reconciled, and of course they would, everything would be better and Crowley would understand. He\u2019d <i>understand</i> that Aziraphale really hadn\u2019t wanted to leave; he\u2019d needed to. Perhaps Crowley might even thank him for taking on something so hard\u2026</p>\n<p>Silly again, Aziraphale thought bitterly. There was no guarantee of anything\u2014 this was not their usual spat. It would be a miracle if Crowley reacted the way Aziraphale wished he would\u2026but he knew all too well that miracles didn\u2019t work like that.</p>\n<p>He refused to think about it now. Aziraphale spun in the chair, as though looking at <i>this</i> white expanse instead of <i>that</i> one would recenter his goals.</p>\n<p>Protect the Earth. Protect Crowley.</p>\n<p>Even if the demon never talked to him again, it would all be worth it, just as long as he was safe and whole.</p>\n<p>From somewhere, Saraqael spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale, the Earth Observation Files suggest that the demons Shax and Furfur may have broken a standing peace agreement when relocating Shax back to hell. Shall we take action?\u201d Aziraphale spun his chair back to find Saraqael very near.</p>\n<p>\u201cEarth Observation Files?\u201d Aziraphale perked up as Saraqael backed away, uncomfortable with the proximity. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p>\n<p>Saraqael stared. \u201cThe name\u2019s rather self-explanatory, I should think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale raised an eyebrow at the unexpected cheek and adjusted the arms of his suit jacket. \u201cWell!\u201d he snipped, clicking his tongue. \u201cHow are they accessed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a terminal. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Saraqael sped off. Aziraphale followed, trying his very best to keep his face neutral. Unlike the other Heaven-based angels, neutral facial expressions were never really his strong suit.</p>\n<p>Soon, a great gleaming obelisk floated before them. A faintly glowing screen cast blue light across Saraqael\u2019s wide eyes as they looked up at Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou request files and they appear. For instance,\u201d they turned to face the obelisk and spoke. \u201cSHAX. FURFUR. MOVING. FROM. FLAT. ON. EARTH. SAFE SEARCH SETTINGS ON.\u201d</p>\n<p>The obelisk seemed to blink, and a small shelf slid out just beneath its screen. A stack of photos materialized there.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, so it\u2019s like a Google,\u201d Aziraphale said, brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d Saraqael said dryly.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t explain. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure he knew what a Google was either. Crowley tried to tell him once, but he took off his jumper halfway through the explanation, and\u2014 well. It couldn\u2019t be helped.</p>\n<p>He thumbed through the pictures instead and sighed with irritation.</p>\n<p>They must\u2019ve received good news in Hell, as Shax and Furfur were, evidently, quite enjoying their last hurrah on Earth. The photos captured the charmless things knocking over rubbish bins, throwing eggs of unknown origin at cars, tripping innocent passersby.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale clicked his tongue. \u201cWhat exactly is the problem here, Saraqael? This all looks very standard,\u201d his mouth pursed as he examined the images, unimpressed. \u201cIf not artlessly juvenile. No flair or creativity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at this here,\u201d Saraqael snapped, feeling as though Aziraphale had quite missed the point, brandishing a photo. \u201cAn unacceptable act of aggression upon a representative of Heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Unacceptable Act of Aggression in question was the placement of a Kick Me sign on the back of one former scrivener, and the resultant kicking that followed, administered by the demons themselves. Aziraphale examined the final image in the series then ran his hands over his face with a groan. It could not be plainer that <i>Muriel</i> was apologizing to the demons, clarifying that the sign must\u2019ve been a mistake, while the demons cackled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo??\u201d Saraqael was impatient. \u201cWhat shall we do about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale simply looked at them for a moment. The words juvenile and artless came back to mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, Saraqael. This is the sort of mischief human children get up to, it hardly merits a diplomatic crisis. I\u2019ll tell Muriel to be more wary when I speak with them next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Saraqael replied with a sour expression. Righteous indignation seemed to be their default setting. Aziraphale found it all very tiresome.</p>\n<p>Saraqael rolled away, but Aziraphale remained at the obelisk. When he was sure he was alone, he spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, hello. This is Aziraphale. S-supreme Archangel of Heaven. Please, um, show me the demon Crowley. Uh, London. Earth. Today.\u201d</p>\n<p>He paused, fist to his mouth, knuckle in his teeth, and then-</p>\n<p>\u201cSafe search settings off. NO! No, safe settings on! Definitely on. My apologies. Wouldn\u2019t want to see anything untoward now, would we?\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Yes we would</i>, hissed a dark-gray voice in his head.</p>\n<p>A stack of papers appeared on the obelisk\u2019s shelf. Hands trembling, Aziraphale took them slowly, glanced at the photo on the top, then shoved the whole stack in his jacket, wondering how he could possibly explain these documents away should anyone inquire.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need- I need a folder. Confidential folder.\u201d One fell into his hand.</p>\n<p>He walked quickly back to chair and sank into it. Did he really want to spy on Crowley? Muriel had already reported the day\u2019s activities, he knew what happened. What right did he have, invading Crowley\u2019s privacy like this?</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Aziraphale grinned. Could it really be considered an invasion of privacy when, at this very moment, the demon was probably reading one of Aziraphale\u2019s diaries without his express permission? This wasn\u2019t an invasion of privacy so much as a defensive counter-attack. Never mind that Aziraphale had set the bait.</p>\n<p>He exhaled sharply to steel himself and then opened the file. He quickly flipped through the pictures.</p>\n<p>Crowley and Muriel.</p>\n<p>Crowley and Muriel.</p>\n<p>Crowley and Muriel and a rather lot of ducks.</p>\n<p>Crowley and Muriel.</p>\n<p>Crowley staggering around the street, drunk and belligerent, waving goodbye. To Muriel.</p>\n<p>Of course they\u2019d spent the day together. Aziraphale knew that. Didn\u2019t bother him any less, however.</p>\n<p>There was an obvious trend across the snapshots. In each, Muriel was beaming at varying degrees of brightness. In some, Crowley smiled too, but it was a weak thing. In most pictures, he didn\u2019t smile. His jaw was set and something about his posture was unlike him. It looked like he was perpetually uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>This both relieved and upset Aziraphale. He bit his lip, trying to sort out his feelings.</p>\n<p>The last few shots were of Crowley alone. Stumbling through the streets back to his flat, then evidently changing his mind and returning to the Bentley.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Crowley, drinking and driving? You wouldn\u2019t!\u201d Aziraphale scolded under his breath at the little Crowley in the photograph, halfway in the Bentley, his leg looking impossibly long.</p>\n<p>But as far as Aziraphale could tell, he didn\u2019t drink and drive. The next shots showed Crowley in the car, diary open, glasses removed. Scowling at the pages in one shot and then laughing in the next.</p>\n<p>Then, awfully, crying. Quite a few shots of him crying.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale hated himself for looking. How dare he intrude on this moment of pain when he was the source of it? He closed the file with force.</p>\n<p>Driven mad by his inability to make up his mind, he opened the file again. He selected his favorite of the snapshots and tucked it into his much-despised tailored suit. Then he closed the file and sent it away with a wave of his hand.</p>\n<p>The picture, tucked firmly against his heart, showed Crowley mid-laugh, eyes closed, head tilted back, diary in hand. Gorgeous.</p>\n<p>The picture convinced Aziraphale that somewhere, deep down, Crowley had to know, <i>had to believe</i>, that he was Aziraphale\u2019s everything. And that, as long as Crowley knew it and believed it, Aziraphale wouldn\u2019t lose him completely. And if right now his diaries were the only way he could tell Crowley that he lived and would die for him, so be it. At least the message was sent, even if too late to enjoy it.</p>\n<p>It was always too late.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale clutched the picture against his chest through his suit jacket and fought back tears. He exhaled and steadied his face in resolve. All this pain would be worth it as long as Crowley was safe.</p>\n<p>Ranking God\u2019s most diabolical mechanisms for suffering, Crowley believed that being simultaneously overjoyed with, and utterly demolished by, one\u2019s beloved was especially high on the list. The emotional peaks and valleys he experienced while reading the latest diary were at such spectral extremes that he felt dizzy with it.</p>\n<p>Crowley rubbed his eyes wearily. He\u2019d stayed in the Bentley all night, drunkenly reading. Spitefully dog-earing pages, folding Muriel\u2019s Post It notes into origami birds that stood sentinel on the dashboard, crying onto one page and seething at the next.</p>\n<p>If anything, the diary had taught him that Aziraphale was very stupid. This also ranked highly on the Suffering Scale- that is, loving someone who was hopelessly stupid, especially one who had the capacity to be irritatingly clever and yet still chose to explore other avenues. Aziraphale was always taking the scenic route of stupidity, while Crowley waited for him, foot tapping, at their destination.</p>\n<p>Crowley squeezed his bleary eyes shut, wanting to discorporate to Hell just so he could storm up the escalators to Heaven and demand to speak with management.</p>\n<p>The diary reminded him that Aziraphale was foolishly conditioned to \u201cdo good\u201d and \u201cbe good\u201d without properly examining either concept, but it fully clarified that, for once, Aziraphale and Crowley were entirely on the same page about one thing; they were made for each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cArhhh!!\u201d Crowley flailed for a moment in the car. \u201cWhy would he do this, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>If the Bentley knew, she didn\u2019t tell him. Crowley sagged.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s think about this rationally. Aziraphale wouldn\u2019t abandon-\u201c he paused, rearranging the thought before he could speak it. \u201cAziraphale wouldn\u2019t abandon the <i>bookshop </i> for a promotion. Of course he wouldnt. He genuinely thinks Heaven will change, won\u2019t muck up our lives\u2026in other words, he\u2019s being a stupid, selfless, beautiful idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Channeling his feelings, he flicked a plump, pink folded bird from the dashboard. It ricocheted against the windshield and landed cutely on his chest. \u201cBahhhgh,\u201d he groaned. He had had quite enough of cute things.</p>\n<p>He held the bird in his fingers, glaring at it. If Aziraphale had any brains at all, he would be with Crowley and not risking the wrath of Heaven when his plan fell to pieces, as it inevitably would.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that would be too easy, my dear boy!\u201d Crowley said in a mockingly posh voice, holding up the origami bird and tilting it with each word as though it was Aziraphale. \u201cWhy would I ever want to make things EASY, Crowley? Don\u2019t you know me at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>The bird\u2019s voice grew increasingly snarly and sarcastic. Crowley crushed it in his palm and tossed it in the seat behind him.</p>\n<p>He returned to the diary at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he murmured, \u201cif I open this to an entry where Aziraphale talks about, about\u2026loving me, then I\u2019ll- I\u2019ll make a plan. I won\u2019t give up on this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t, then I accept his decision and I get along with my life. Nothing lasts forever, blah blah blah, the whole shabang. I\u2019ll wash my hands of it all.\u201d</p>\n<p>More entries spoke highly of Crowley than didn\u2019t. His odds were good.</p>\n<p>He exhaled. Eyes closed, Crowley opened the diary.</p>\n<p>Another exhale. He opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>This page\u2019s entry began halfway through the prior\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201c\u2026believe that, but Crowley seems to think so. I choose to trust him, no matter how worrisome it is to me.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Rest assured, I remain ever vigilant. Perhaps our respective offices will leave us be, but I\u2019ve prepared for other, less happy outcomes. In an abundance of caution, I will not commit these plans to page here.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I admit I\u2019m laughing at this entry- I write as if I\u2019m a spy or a criminal mastermind, rather than a silly old angel, fussing over his bookshop and the demon dozing on the settee. Still, I must resign myself to this new position as an \u201cenemy of the state.\u201d It would feel quite glamourous if it weren\u2019t so sad.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I\u2019m sure this is harder for me than it is for Crowley. I would hazard a guess that he finds being cast out of both Heaven <u>and</u> Hell to be terribly (and I do apologize for the phrasing, but) sexy. He walks with even more sway to his hips now, a feat I previously believed impossible (but am in reverence of regardless). He wears ostracization like a fabulous accessory and flaunts himself accordingly. Plainly put, he loves it.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I want to be pleased that <u>he</u> is so pleased, but oh, I fear that She might not be. Are we awaiting the other shoe\u2019s swift and inevitable drop? And what can I do to keep him safe if it comes down upon us?</i>\n</p>\n<p>How irritating, Crowley thought, who read the passage with wide and hungry eyes, feeling wholly beloved. How irritating that they felt so similarly about their situation and never said it out loud.</p>\n<p>Did Aziraphale think Crowley hadn\u2019t gone half crazy, trying to guess the Almighty\u2019s next move? He\u2019d worn circles into the ground from pacing, wondering how he could keep Aziraphale well enough away from Her fury. Of course Crowley was afraid of Her too- She\u2019s GOD.</p>\n<p>This entry was laughable, really, considering Crowley was the only one between the two of them to both witness Her wrath and bear it directly.</p>\n<p>And sure, he leaned into the joy of finally being free while he could. Of both of them being free. It felt like stretching his wings again after a hundred years of hiding them. It felt good.</p>\n<p>Crowley growled. Why were they always afraid of being punished for feeling good?</p>\n<p>He was reminded of another entry he\u2019d read and flipped to it quickly. The book made this easy. It wasn\u2019t bending to Crowley\u2019s typical control over the inanimate; this diary seemed independently willing to cooperate with him.</p>\n<p>\n<i>March 23rd,</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Dear Diary,</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I scarcely have the energy to write. Forgive my abnormally shaky handwriting. Today was everything I dreamt it would be, and yet, I sit here trembling.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Crowley finally agreed to visit Kew Gardens with me. I have visited more times than I could count, but Crowley had never been. I tempted him- the gardens are lovely at the start of Spring, I told him, and by some miracle, I was rewarded with the pleasure and privilege to escort him through the grounds myself.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>We spent five delightful hours there. He whispered to plants and I was perfectly content to observe. He preferred exotic leafy things and only paid attention to the flowers if I pointed them out.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>He wore a very dark green jumper under a taut black suit jacket, and the effect was enchanting. The verdant greens around him made the crimson of his hair blaze particularly fiercely, and it took every ounce of my self-control not to touch him. I admit I spent much of the day dreaming I had my canvas and easel with me, wondering if Crowley would model for me if I asked very nicely.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>At some point, however, he asked what I was staring at. From then on, I tried my very best to look anywhere but him.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The day passed very pleasantly. As we stopped for a small bite, Crowley asked me which plant specimen had been my favorite. Of course, I told him I appreciate the beauty inherent in all Her creations, but he snarled at that quite harshly and asked if I really thought something like a corpse flower was as pleasing as a daffodil.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I admitted I found the dahlias exceptional. He told me his favorite, a scientific name I can\u2019t recall now for a glossy, wide-leafed vine, and I thought the topic was closed.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>A while later, we strolled together down yet another garden path. We were so close, achingly close. Our arms bumped together enough times I nearly lost count. (I didn\u2019t, of course. 36.)</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Unexpectedly, he put a hand on my arm, leaned in and whispered \u201cBe right back, Angel.\u201d I was stunned speechless by the sudden proximity, and couldn\u2019t find my voice again until he was already out of sight.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>His tone was unmistakable, however, so I prepared myself for demonic antics I was sure would follow.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I was wrong, for when he returned, he held the most impressive dahlia of the bunch in his outstretched hand, offering it to me. It was as large as a dinner plate and deep velvety red.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>If I were mortal, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve survived it.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cThought it was pretty,\u201d he said, and pretty it was indeed. It was the most lovely blossom I\u2019ve ever seen. I would recreate it here if only I could get my hand to steady.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I tried to thank him profusely, but within moments, a squadron of security guards interrupted, demanding that we vacate the garden immediately and not return. Crowley laughed and strode out, calling \u201cbe back next week, love!\u201d to the poor officers. I followed.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>By now, dusk was falling over London and stars appeared above us. Our arms bumped again.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Something came over me. I felt prepared to tell him these feelings I have grappled with for centuries, the feelings I have only shared with you, Diary. I turned to face him, opened my mouth- and he said \u201cwait.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>He pointed out a trio of people across the street. I hadn\u2019t noticed them, but once I did, my heart dropped. Uriel, Sandalphan, and Michael stared at us.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>We stopped. They continued to stare. Then, after a few moments, they disappeared into the sky.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>We made it back to the bookshop without further incident, but all thoughts of confession turned to ashes and all hopes of a nightcap were dashed. We bid farewell at the bookshop door, agreeing we ought to lay low for a few days. Apart.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>I can\u2019t imagine why archangels would stalk us at a garden, but it terrifies me. I feel like the dahlia can sense this; it has wilted terribly since Crowley left. So have I.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>So, dearest diary, I regretfully inform you that today, just as every other, did not end with the love of my life in my arms. It began promisingly enough, though, and that shall sustain me for at least a little longer.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Crowley exhaled. He was angry. Angry with Heaven for taking from him, always taking. He barely even registered that the Bentley was on the move before it pulled up to the bookshop.</p>\n<p>He was out of the car and at the entry in a few long strides. A customer carrying a paper bag nearly passed him with a book she had successfully managed to purchase.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that, thank you,\u201d Crowley said, not slowing down as he walked by her. He pulled the book from her bag and snapped; whatever argument she\u2019d planned, she promptly forgot.</p>\n<p>\u201cOI, CONSTABLE?! Have you lost your mind?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d Muriel beamed from behind the counter. \u201cSomething wonderful just happened; I sold my first book!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and your last!\u201d He returned the copy of <i>The Two Foscari</i> to its shelf. \u201cWhat d\u2019you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026running a bookshop,\u201d Muriel replied slowly, the way one would talk to someone with a head injury.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, actually, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re babysitting a book collection while the owner is out on business.\u201d Crowley spat, hands on his hips.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the Metatron said-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Metatron?! The Metatron can get bent for all I care!\u201d He began pacing. \u201cEvery book you sell belongs to Aziraphale, so technically, you know, you\u2019re stealing. God doesn\u2019t like that now, does She?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel swallowed. \u201cBut Aziraphale left them behi-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back. I know how to get him back. So don\u2019t even THINK about selling another dusty book.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled widely at the finger Crowley pointed in their face.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley, you finally came inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley looked around, startled. Here he was. Aziraphale\u2019s bookshop. Really <i>his</i> bookshop too. Their bookshop. It felt like it had been ages.</p>\n<p>He sniffed. \u201cBeen in here loads of times. What of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel wasn\u2019t fooled by Crowley\u2019s forced cool demeanor but had the good sense not to comment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d was all they said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan, then?\u201d Muriel pulled up a chair as Crowley rummaged around the shop, looking for a specific wine he liked and that he knew Aziraphale would have stocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, the plan, Constable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, your plan you said you had, back when you were shouting at me a few minutes ago?\u201d Muriel replied helpfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, right, the plan.\u201d Crowley entered the front area of the shop again, wine in one hand and glasses in the other. \u201c<i>The plan</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stood before Muriel a moment, mouth moving like a TV character on mute. \u201cI don\u2019t actually have one, as it were.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel blinked. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d He swung the hand with the wine bottle dismissively. \u201cI never make plans, anyway, that\u2019s Aziraphale\u2019s thing.\u201d Crowley uncorked the wine with a snap. \u201cHe\u2019s all about plans, great complicated, nonsensical plans, and I\u2019m all about, well, making it up on the fly, I suppose. It\u2019s always worked out for me.\u201d He paused. \u201cWell, usually.\u201d Crowley poured wine into the glasses and offered one to Muriel.</p>\n<p>They stared at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave some wine.\u201d He thrust it towards them. <i>\u201cTo look at,\u201d</i> he added, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>Brimming with apprehension but putting on a brave face, Muriel took the wine glass. They swirled the liquid inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cP-pretty,\u201d they remarked.</p>\n<p>\u201cTastes good, too,\u201d Crowley added, taking a swig.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Muriel began slowly, focusing on the wine sloshing and trying hard to appear as though they hadn\u2019t already plotted the idea out six hundred different ways and in the context of several different alternate universes. \u201cI might have a- a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you now?\u201d Crowley peered over his glasses, more amused than interested. \u201cGo on, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel exhaled with a smile, giggling nervously. \u201cYes, okay. Good. Okay. So.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley tilted his head, wondering if the scrivener had broken. He cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d they blushed, pulling themselves together. \u201cSo, each day, Aziraphale will check in with me. Either I contact him or he contacts me using that little gateway thing. I think it\u2019s mostly an excuse to get updates about you or to get a peek at the shop. He never seems to pay much attention to my other reports.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled brightly as though that didn\u2019t hurt their feelings. Crowley felt a bit sorry for them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d they continued. \u201cLast night, I mentioned that I would try selling a book. I thought it might coax him down, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCoax him?\u201d Now Crowley was interested. \u201cWhy, exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel huffed, looking away. \u201cWell, because!\u201d They stamped their foot in helpless frustration. \u201cB-because he\u2019s miserable! You\u2019re miserable! I\u2019ve only read about five thousand books about love and misery, and, well,\u201d they straightened their back. \u201cIn my professional opinion as a book seller, you two are a mess. And, truth be told, I really can\u2019t stand to see it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley gaped at them. \u201cYou really have been reading, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Muriel nodded emphatically. \u201cI won\u2019t have this turning into <i>Persuasion</i>. I can\u2019t go through that twice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a novel, you know. This isn\u2019t,\u201d Crowley\u2019s eyes landed on a book title. \u201c<i>Wuthering Heights</i> or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear me, no! That would be dreadful! Absolute worst case scenario, can you imagine?\u201d Muriel shuddered.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever actually read it,\u201d Crowley sniffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, but you must! It\u2019s wonderful. And so awful. You\u2019d love it. There\u2019s this woman, Cathy, and her adopted brother, Heathcliff, and-\u201c</p>\n<p>Muriel caught Crowley\u2019s expression and fell quiet. It was hard to stop talking about books once they started. \u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t spoil it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what do we do when Aziraphale calls? What\u2019s the next part of the plan? I tell him to quit Heaven and come home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, definitely not. You wait for him to decide that himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible plan. He\u2019s too, he\u2019s too\u201c Crowley grimaced. \u201cToo noble. He won\u2019t abandon his post.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might,\u201d Muriel said knowingly, eyes wide. \u201cHe\u2019s very jealous, you see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley blinked. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Muriel straightened their shirt and smoothed out their trouser legs, looking around uncomfortably. \u201cOf me, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Crowley asked, flabbergasted to the point of rudeness. \u201cSorry, that came out wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I get to run the bookshop. And I get to see you. And you gave me a gift,\u201d Muriel smiled awkwardly. \u201cAnd showed me the ducks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley groaned. \u201cYou told him about all that? Whose side are you on anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on your side! Yours and his, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s eyebrows shot up. <i>Their</i> side had never had more than two people. A lot of the time lately, it only had one. He\u2019d never expected it to have room for three.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you think seeing me during a call will drive him so mad that he\u2019ll leave his heavenly throne and, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe your boyfriend, I suppose?\u201d Muriel sniffed the wine cautiously. They took a tiny sip.</p>\n<p>It was good. Muriel took a bigger sip. The wine was not as sweet as a Shirley Temple, and had no fun little fruits bobbing in it, but the effect was pleasant and felt warm when swallowed.</p>\n<p>Crowley, meanwhile, didn\u2019t know how to respond to the word boyfriend. He nearly forgot that was a word people used.<br>\nWhatever he and Aziraphale were or could someday be, \u2018boyfriend\u2019 felt too small to fit it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he was so jealous that he\u2019d come down here, then why isn\u2019t he here now? As you said, I took you to meet ducks! Practically the pinnacle of romantic endeavors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel noted the sarcasm there and felt proud of themselves. They were getting better at earth-style conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause ducks aren\u2019t enough-\u201c Muriel punctuated each word with an emphatic clap. \u201cWe need to do more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley raised an eyebrow at Muriel\u2019s investment. They continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale has been able to stomach hearing about all this, but I suspect seeing us together would be a different story entirely. Ducks and diaries are all very well and good, but we need something bigger. Like, say you tell me his favorite book, and he calls while you\u2019re reading it to me? Or say we-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDine at the Ritz,\u201d Crowley whispered, certain that was the key.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr do whatever that means, yeah! Exactly!\u201d Muriel replied enthusiastically, then faltered. \u201cIs that the fancy restaurant Aziraphale talks about in the diary? Will I have to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley was pacing, thinking this through. It seemed sacrilegious, inviting Muriel into their place.</p>\n<p>But his mind was whirring with plans.</p>\n<p>Step one: take Muriel to the Ritz. Have a grand time.<br>\nStep two: Later, let Aziraphale call while Crowley was in the shop. Make cold, disinterested conversation with Aziraphale.<br>\nStep 3: Teach Muriel <i>A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square</i> beforehand; make them hum it absently in the background until Aziraphale notices and explodes</p>\n<p>Evil, evil stuff. He couldn\u2019t possibly.</p>\n<p>New plan:<br>\n1. Take Muriel to the Ritz to look in the window.<br>\n2. Muriel could then tell Aziraphale that Crowley took them to the Ritz- it wouldn\u2019t be lying, after all- but Crowley could preserve the restaurant as just for the two of them. Perfect.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your coat, Muriel, we\u2019re going to the Ritz.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh jolly good!\u201d Muriel cried, clapping their hands. \u201cSo you think my plan will work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley looked at them, this cherubic angel, with a million-kilowatt smile and feet that always seemed to be bouncing with excitement, and wondered if they weren\u2019t, in fact, a demon. An angel with a knack for manipulation such as this was something of an anomaly. Ought he be worried?</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled eagerly, awaiting his response, little fists balled up as if they were clutching their hope in their hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould, I suppose,\u201d said Crowley cooly. Muriel squealed with excitement.</p>\n<p><i>Probably not a threat, </i>Crowley decided. <i>But better stick around and keep an eye on them, just to make sure.</i></p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Within the hour, the two of them stood outside the Ritz, peering in.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d be able to see it much better inside, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Muriel asked, as though this comment was helpful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thanks, I have got a brain, Muriel,\u201d Crowley replied sarcastically. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go in there with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, painful memories and all that again?\u201d Muriel tried to conceal their disappointment in a cheery voice that inadvertently came across very mockingly. Crowley glared.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou don\u2019t eat. And I barely eat. Hardly fair to take a table at the Ritz for two beings who only drink, when there are perfectly marvelous pubs nearby. Have you seen enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel took one final glance at the Ritz, then nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Crowley nodded. \u201cC\u2019mon then. Drinks on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They walked a few blocks and came upon The Goat Tavern, a green and gold pub. Muriel came to a stop, looking at the golden goat statue above the entrance with trepidation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a satanic bar, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>A pair of elderly men walked out of the pub, smiling kindly at them. Crowley nodded cordially at the gentlemen before cocking a skeptical eyebrow at Muriel.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoats, you know,\u201d Muriel tried to explain. \u201cSome people say they\u2019re satanic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoats?\u201d Crowley asked incredulously. \u201cHave you met a goat before? Hilarious, for starters- great fun. Make the best sounds. Now, come in, Inspector. If there\u2019s any satanic activity, you\u2019ll have a chance to cast it out, cleanse the place- whatever it is you angels do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel followed hesitantly. \u201cMy miracles are record-keeping specific, actually. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m able to do any other type.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley, having crossed the pub and now leaning on the bar counter, rolled his head towards Muriel. \u201cLucky for you, that\u2019s an easy fix. I\u2019ll teach you how to do a little\u2026system override, we\u2019ll call it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to. I\u2019ll get into trouble, messing around with my pre-sets without permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky for you, you\u2019ve got a boss about as threatening as a ripe summer plum. All give, all sweetness. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel mulled over the odd turn of phrase in their mind and concluded that it was probably sexual, but wasn\u2019t exactly sure how.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Ello, what\u2019ll it be?\u201d A dark-skinned and burly man approached the counter from the opposite side, tossing two paper coasters to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cTalisker for me. And you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley looked at Muriel expectantly, who realized this was some kind of test.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a\u2026a\u2026Pimm\u2019s Cup, please. With a cherry. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith a cherry,\u201d the barman repeated, nodding with a wink at Muriel. He turned and busied himself with the shelves of liquor behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPimm\u2019s Cup?\u201d Crowley turned to them, sounding almost hurt. \u201cHave you gone to the pub without me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, not at all. I saw it in a drink recipe book Aziraphale keeps at the shop. Pimm\u2019s Cups have little foods inside. Floating in there. All I\u2019ve had to eat so far are cherries from Shirley Temples. I want to try a few more drink foods.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, just order normal food. They serve actual meals here,\u201d Crowley said, gesturing at a barmaid setting a plate of fish and chips down for a patron at the end of the bar counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, better not. I think I just like the foods that come in alcohol, like the cherries in Shirley Temple.\u201d Muriel smiled and folded their hands in their lap. The barmaid passed them, but not without an \u201cafternoon, love\u201d and a wink at Muriel.</p>\n<p>Muriel knew that winks could mean a great deal of things, but couldn\u2019t come up with a good reason why either barperson had winked here. Muriel could only conclude that this was simply how humans behaved in bars.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t-?\u201d Crowley gaped. \u201cMuriel. Shirley Temples are not alcoholic. You do know this, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, of course!\u201d Muriel winked at him dramatically.</p>\n<p>Crowley furrowed his brow at them, feeling for the first time ever that there was a language he couldn\u2019t speak fluently on Earth; Murielese.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you just like foods in liquids, you could try soup,\u201d Crowley continued, trying to move on from the baffling wink. \u201cStew, even.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel considered this. Soup did sound very wonderful in the books they\u2019d read. They suddenly felt brave.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Barman?\u201d Muriel called hesitantly. The barman turned, their ready drinks in hand.</p>\n<p>He smiled charmingly at Muriel, barely acknowledging Crowley. \u201cHere you are, love. What can I do for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d Muriel smiled at all the little foods in the Pimm\u2019s Cup. \u201cHave you got any soups?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure; potato leek, tomato, mulligatawny\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so many choices,\u201d Muriel looked worried. They turned to Crowley.</p>\n<p>He sighed crossly. \u201cAziraphale would\u2019ve ordered the mulligatawny. And from my understanding, he has somewhat\u2026\u201d he grumbled. \u201cExcellent taste.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded happily and turned back to the barman. \u201cMulligatawny, please!\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded with another sweet smile and was off.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cTypically, they ask me what I want as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you want something? We can call him back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! But I like telling them, anyway,\u201d he pouted. He normally received plenty of attention in bar settings. Not that he cared much for it, but\u2026his ego was a bit fragile as of late.</p>\n<p>By the time Muriel\u2019s soup arrived, they\u2019d developed a plan. Crowley would remain in the shop until Aziraphale called. He would make a production of leaving. Then, Muriel would provide details about the day to Aziraphale and mention both selling a book and going to the Ritz.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d Crowley said darkly. \u201cI return, interrupt your call, and ask if we\u2019re still on for tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, we\u2019ll say we\u2019re, I don\u2019t know, headed to the park again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut will we actually?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley considered it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we will. So we can work on your miracle pre-sets. Are you going to try your soup?\u201d</p>\n<p>The bowl sat before Muriel, silently challenging them. They picked up a fork.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, try this one,\u201d Crowley grunted, swapping the fork for a spoon. \u201cYou take the spoon, scoop up the soup, blow on it for a moment, and then put it in your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlow on it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, whooo\u201d Crowley pursed his lips and blew air. Muriel giggled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuman bodies are so weird,\u201d they said. Hand trembling, they followed Crowley\u2019s instructions. The soup sat in their mouth for a few moments.</p>\n<p>\u201cSwallow, Muriel! Just like a drink!\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel swallowed hurriedly and gasped.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Crowley studied their face.</p>\n<p>Muriel\u2019s eyes were like saucers. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026fantastic.\u201d</p>\n<p>They dove back into the soup, eating far too quickly and loudly. The barman watched, seeming utterly enraptured by the display.</p>\n<p><i>Humans are attracted to the oddest things,</i> Crowley thought to himself, the hypocrisy entirely lost on him.</p>\n<p>When they returned to the shop a few hours later, Crowley was pleasantly buzzed.</p>\n<p>Muriel, however, was positively sloshed. Their right arm was over Crowley\u2019s shoulder as he did his best to keep them both upright.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Crowley!\u201d Muriel spluttered, flinging an arm to their left, pointing at a figure down the block. \u201cIt\u2019s Maggie!\u201d They spoke her name as if she were the most precious of all Earth\u2019s offerings.</p>\n<p>\u201cOI, MAGGIE! MAGGIE THE RECORD SHOP HUMAN!\u201d Muriel waved their arm chaotically. \u201cYOO-HOO! Yoo-HOOOOOO!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut it!\u201d Crowley hissed, still not keen to run into Maggie after what happened since they last spoke. \u201cYou need to sober up!\u201d He scolded.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeh,\u201d Muriel rolled their head to look at Crowley, eyes unfocused. \u201cWho, me?\u201d They pointed a lax finger towards themselves and chuckled.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t be mad at them, not really. This was yet another Earthly lesson Muriel would need to learn. No one knows their limits right away. Now they knew Seven Pimm\u2019s Cups and a glass of wine amounted to an measure of alcohol well past Muriel\u2019s limit.</p>\n<p>\u201cGimme your keys, you idiot,\u201d Crowley snarled, trying desperately to get into the shop before Maggie arrived.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re MINE!\u201d Muriel snapped suddenly, going very rigid. \u201cI can do it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Reaching into their pocket, they pulled out a pen from the pub and tried to jam it into the keyhole.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Crowley groaned, removing his arm from Muriel and letting them fall to the ground. They cackled.</p>\n<p>It occurred to Crowley that actually he\u2019d never needed a key to the bookshop. He snapped his fingers and the doors opened. Maybe he was drunker than he realized.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d Maggie called softly behind him. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cFabulous, as you can see.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the ground, Muriel let out a silly little giggle. \u201cThis is a <i>pen,</i> not a key!\u201d</p>\n<p>Befuddled, Maggie looked at them for moment. \u201cMr. Fell around, by any chance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually!\u201d Muriel announced, standing up. \u201cI am now the pur-pury-purveyor of this establishment. I\u2019m Mr.- uh, Mr. Muriel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cCrowley, what\u2019s really happened? Where did Mr. Fell go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley turned to look at her. \u201cHe took a new job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd did\u2026did you do what we-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maggie understood how it went by the expression on Crowley\u2019s face. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel swayed on the spot, looking between them. \u201cOh buck up, you two! It\u2019s just a little tiff, it\u2019ll work out. Soon enough, Mr. Crowley and Mr. Fell will be\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley gritted his teeth and Maggie grimaced, both fearful of whatever Muriel would say next.</p>\n<p>\u201cLovers,\u201d Muriel finally said, gushingly, suppressing a burp and looking supremely unbothered. Crowley groaned with disgust.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, you actually need to sober up right now. I won\u2019t let you in the shop if you might throw up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel blinked at him. \u201cHow\u2019d\u2019I do dat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just do it. You just focus on the alcohol leaving your body. Release it from yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maggie looked startled, having only a few ideas what this could mean.</p>\n<p>Muriel focused. Their slight swaying steadied. And after a few more seconds, they stood perfectly straight, with an expression like they tasted something very unpleasant.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Muriel said, terribly sober and evidently quite embarrassed. \u201cShall we, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>They marched inside stiffly, their blush evident even on the back of their neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, one of your lot then, I presume,\u201d Maggie said, understanding nothing that had just happened except that it was supernatural.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t lump them in with me!\u201d Crowley replied quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I remember them now! The pure white police officer! They look so much more normal now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Maggie smiled and touched Crowley\u2019s arm. \u201cIf you need anything, Crowley, I\u2019m only next door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMeh,\u201d he replied, waving her arm away. She smiled softly again and walked on.</p>\n<p><i>Humans are awful,</i> he thought, feeling fondly towards the one who\u2019d just left. He entered the shop again, a little slowly. It still took some getting used to.</p>\n<p>The clock read half-past seven. \u201cAlright, Constable, how shall we prepare for your conference call?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel was already darting around the shop, arranging books into piles so as to suggest they\u2019d been recently used or discussed. Two wine glasses, partially filled, sat on the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, he really could call at any time. We ought to take our seats, look comfortable, act as if we\u2019re discussing books.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really read books,\u201d Crowley replied, sitting on the couch, examining his nails.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly, it\u2019ll drive him mad if you\u2019ve started reading them now that\u2019s he\u2019s gone. Take this one,\u201d Muriel held up <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the synopsis.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the end of Muriel\u2019s retelling, Crowley was both confused (there were far too many characters, with far too many shared first names) and a bit shocked. He thought his relationship was a mess, but yeesh. It could get much worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t test me on this, I will fail,\u201d Crowley said, sipping some of his wine. \u201cHow does my hair look?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel exhaled fondly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Crowley. You look exactly how Aziraphale likes you best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley blushed, wanting to argue or say that that wasn\u2019t why he\u2019d asked. But Muriel would know better. They were quiet for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow what should we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley sat up. \u201cLet\u2019s work on your factory settings. Get you an upgrade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel shook their head. \u201cWhat if he sees?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Crowley waved his hand. \u201cAs if he hadn\u2019t done this all himself a few thousand years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel gulped. \u201cO-okay. What do I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, Muriel. You just need to tell yourself you can do it. And then you can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to break the rules. That\u2019s it. The only thing stopping you from performing any miracle you\u2019d like is you and whoever told you to fall in line in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cAm I being tempted? Is that what this is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley shrugged casually, lounging back on the couch, his legs too long. \u201cI guess, but I\u2019m non-affiliated, so what harm could it do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel\u2019s eyes darted around Crowley\u2019s face. They wished he would remove his glasses. That would make all of this easier to trust.</p>\n<p>They exhaled, then focused on a human passing by the shop. With a few swirls of their hand, the human hurried into the bookshop, then stopped.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, my apologies. Wrong shop,\u201d they said, confused and a little upset, before running back out of the shop.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you do that?\u201d Crowley asked. \u201cNice work, only next time give them a reason for what they\u2019re doing or they\u2019ll go all weird on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Outside, the human was clearly in the midst of some sort of panic attack. Crowley snapped, and the human continued on as though nothing out of the ordinary had just happened.</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded, in complete awe of the miracle. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it was as easy as all that. Just say I can do it, and I can do it. Brilliant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once started, Muriel found it hard to stop casting miracles. They summoned wine bottles, they closed curtains. With a sweeping wave, every book on every shelf in the shop rearranged, leaving books sorted by color only.</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah now, that\u2019s a bit much I think-\u201c Crowley coughed, when suddenly, the thick dust the books left suspended in the air was alight with a white-blue glow.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, what the blazes is going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>The dust was thick enough to obscure Aziraphale. Crowley froze.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry, Supreme Archangel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale was impatient. \u201cPlease, Muriel, just Aziraphale is FINE. Now what have you done to my shop? Why on earth is it foggy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s dust, sir, I was doing some rearranging\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRearranging?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, the books\u2026by color.\u201d Muriel said as if it caused them physical pain to admit it. Crowley willed himself not to laugh. He probably would\u2019ve laughed in any other circumstance.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale let out a long sigh. The dust began to fall, but Aziraphale seemed not to notice, as he began reading from a document.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just received notification of excess miraculous energy from the shop, far beyond your usual output. I\u2019m not a stickler but I do need some clarification as to why-\u201c</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked up. His eyes locked with Crowley\u2019s, just visible in the settling dust.</p>\n<p>\u201c-this is happening,\u201d he finished lamely.</p>\n<p>Crowley wanted to say so many things. <i>I love you,</i> for one, and <i>I missed you, please come home,</i> for two. But instead, he said:</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Aziraphale. Nice suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a compliment, and Aziraphale knew better than to take it as one.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Crowley,\u201d Aziraphale replied, not sure what tone to use and rapidly cycling through several. \u201cAre you well?\u201d His eyes scanned every inch of Crowley with a hint of badly-concealed need and even worse-concealed worry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am indeed,\u201d Crowley said with more bravado than made sense. \u201cHow\u2019s Heaven?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale swallowed. \u201cAh, well. It\u2019s - it\u2019s Heaven, after all! Lovely, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Crowley replied, mockingly sweet. Muriel cleared their throat, attempting to remind Crowley of the plan to leave the shop.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, Ange-<i>Aziraphale</i>,\u201d Crowley was proud of how he corrected himself. \u201cWho\u2019ve you cast into hellfire since you took on the job? I do love office gossip,\u201d he growled.</p>\n<p>To that, Aziraphale clicked his tongue. \u201cI hardly think we need to be petty, my d- my\u2026\u201d Aziraphale was not so good at corrections.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Your</i>? Your what?\u201d Crowley was determined to give Aziraphale no mercy whatsoever. \u201cAir too thin up there to think properly, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale sighed. \u201cI apologize, as much as I would like\u2026would like to catch up with you, I have important matters to discuss with Muriel, here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh yes, come to scold them for <i>too many frivolous miracles,</i> that\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyebrows fell. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it was my fault,\u201d Crowley said, standing with his arms wide. \u201cI taught them what to do, just the same as I taught you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked down. \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you? You send a scrivener down here, entirely untrained, and get upset when they try to figure out how to survive on Earth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was-\u201c Aziraphale interjected.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken all that trademark Heaven common sense to heart, Aziraphale. Great work. I won\u2019t keep you, Supreme Archangel. Enjoy your meeting,\u201d Crowley said lightly. His body shook with too many feelings.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d Aziraphale said quickly, just as the demon strode away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He didn\u2019t look back at the floating head of his most beloved, most terrible\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really- it was good to see you,\u201d Aziraphale said softly. Sadly.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d was all Crowley could muster before walking out the door. The cool London air embraced him, and only then did he realize how hot his body was.</p>\n<p>He was a block away before he remembered he was supposed to return to the shop and invite Muriel out to the park the next day.</p>\n<p>He spun, heading back. Seeing Aziraphale was like erupting with lightning. He felt every cell of his skin buzz.</p>\n<p>He was still so angry. And so torturously in love. He wondered what would happen if he stepped into the gateway while Aziraphale\u2019s head was in it. Would he wind up in Heaven where Aziraphale was?</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d discorporate for sure. He didn\u2019t know who, if anyone, would be willing to give him a new body now. Certainly no one in Hell. Perhaps only one person in Heaven.</p>\n<p>Crowley threw the shop doors open and strode inside. \u201cSorry to interrupt! Forgot something!\u201d He called out. \u201cMuriel, are we still-?\u201d</p>\n<p>He stopped a few strides in. Muriel was gone.</p>\n<p>Instead, standing before him in a finely-tailored and lightest blue suit, was Aziraphale. Just Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Crowley breathed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale replied, wiping a tear off his cheek</p>\n<p>They stared at each other for a moment.</p>\n<p>Diary entries swam through Crowley\u2019s head. Words he\u2019d only dreamt of hearing Aziraphale say echoed around his brain. Words Aziraphale wrote. Feelings Aziraphale felt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale just looked at Crowley, as if he had so many things to say, none of them could squeeze through. He tried a few times to speak. He opened his mouth and squeaked slightly. He stepped forward, and stepped back, and then turned away from Crowley entirely.</p>\n<p>Crowley stepped forward. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He repeated with more urgency. The scrivener\u2019s absence was loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust business,\u201d Aziraphale finally said. \u201cHeavenly machinations, you know. Very busy. Not all of us have had time to spare for,\u201d the angel hissed, \u201cthe Ritz.\u201d</p>\n<p>By this point, Aziraphale had slowly angled towards Crowley. He glanced at him for a moment, then looked away. Crowley looked back stoically. His pounding heart was anything but.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me more about your lessons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLessons?\u201d Crowley repeated. \u201cWhat lessons?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEarth lessons. Muriel says you\u2019ve been teaching them.\u201d Aziraphale looked very stony. There was no hint of flirtation here.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ve been trying to fill in the blanks your lot forgot to share with them before you chucked them down here to fend for themselves. I took them to see the ducks at St. James\u2019s, took them to have a few pints, ate some soup\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley was a demon. He was a DEMON, damn it all. But he looked at Aziraphale, who seemed carved out of stone down to the last white curl, and broke. \u201cAnd yeah, I took them to see the Ritz. We looked in through the window. Didn\u2019t even go inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyes met Crowley\u2019s. They were stormy, but something in them seemed to lighten marginally.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what about miracles?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley shrugged again. \u201cI told them they could do whatever miracle they wanted if they gave themselves permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Muriel\u2019s permission to give, Crowley!\u201d Aziraphale shouted suddenly, his hand coming down on the desk.</p>\n<p>Crowley seethed. \u201cWho gave you permission to break your rules, Aziraphale? Who told you to give the humans that flaming sword?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is different!\u201d Aziraphale shot back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?!\u201d They were close now. The air between them was hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause NO ONE WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO ME! TO US! TO YOU!\u201d Aziraphale bellowed. \u201cYou HAD to know you\u2019d be scrutinized after turning my offer down!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you mean by you? You were watching me, right? Getting reports?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale faltered. \u201cThat was different. That wasn\u2019t this.\u201d The angel swallowed, knowing he wasn\u2019t making any sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was checking in on you out of selfishness, Crowley. I was checking in because I wanted to know- wanted to know you were okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley would\u2019ve done the same thing, given the opportunity, but he snarled anyway. \u201cSo you spied on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale grimaced. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s sick. You know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked down. \u201cMaybe so, but that\u2019s not why Muriel\u2019s\u2026not here. They\u2019re not here, not here\u2026because the Metatron, he\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The angel stopped. He looked down at his shoes, then up at the ceiling, trying to hold back tears. He glanced at Crowley, who only then realized that it wasn\u2019t just Muriel and himself in trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cAngel?\u201d Crowley whispered, realizing he\u2019d said that word only after it had left his lips. Aziraphale choked, and a sob escaped.</p>\n<p>In a breath, they were together. Crowley held Aziraphale tightly and Aziraphale sobbed against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cShhhh,\u201d Crowley whispered, running his hand on Aziraphale\u2019s hair. \u201cShhh, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Crowley, it really- it really is so terrible, you have no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeep breaths, Angel. Then tell me all about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley led Aziraphale to the couch as Aziraphale struggled to regain composure. He slowly managed to calm himself into occasional shuddery gasps and hiccups.</p>\n<p>Finally, he drug his eyes up to meet Crowley\u2019s. Tears threatened to fall, but didn\u2019t, as if Crowley had commanded them to stay.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, first of all,\u201d Aziraphale sighed. \u201cEveryone in heaven is a complete <i>bitch.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley laughed, and Aziraphale smiled in spite of himself. \u201cI could\u2019ve told you that much, Angel! You don\u2019t belong up there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t, I knew that going into it. I hate these suits,\u201d he moaned, tugging on his blazer.</p>\n<p>Immediately, Crowley got to work at taking the offensive garment off Aziraphale. He threw it roughly to the floor and undid the tie around the angel\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter now?\u201d Crowley grinned.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stared at him, fully stunned. Crowley turned scarlet.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Aziraphale finally whispered.</p>\n<p>They held each other\u2019s gaze for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on, Angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked down. \u201cYou won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen have I ever liked anything?\u201d Crowley smiled, lifting Aziraphale\u2019s chin, trying his best to fight off the apprehension building in his stomach. Just for a moment more. He was with Aziraphale again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey- they think you\u2019re\u2026they think you may be a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley blinked. \u201cUh, yeah? Are you going to tell me the sky is blue next?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t like before, Crowley. The Metatron, he sent Muriel here on purpose. They were a test, an assessment or something. I only just found out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wanted to how you\u2019d respond to a new angel in your quadrant. Wanted to see if you\u2019d attempt to, I don\u2019t know, expand your influence over another heavenly entity. Like you did with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s mouth was agape. He didn\u2019t understand. \u201cBut me and Muriel, it\u2019s nothing like you and me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I told him your influence was good, not dangerous. That was,\u201d Aziraphale gulped. \u201cThe wrong thing to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you in trouble, Angel?\u201d Crowley scanned Aziraphale\u2019s face for signs of injury or scorch marks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe? No, Crowley, you are!\u201d</p>\n<p>Something about the tone led Crowley to think Aziraphale was lying. Crowley was sure Aziraphale\u2019s situation was bad, but he refused to admit it. The angel continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to stay away from the shop. You need to keep yourself hidden, at least for a little bit!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley darkened. \u201cWhere\u2019s Muriel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn Heaven,\u201d Aziraphale said fretfully. \u201cThe Metatron is going to interview them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd by interview them, you actually mean-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDetermine if they\u2019ve behaved in such a way to deserve\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Crowley muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cFalling,\u201d Aziraphale cried, collapsing into tears again.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Crowley thought Muriel\u2019s manipulative skills would be far too powerful when used demonically, but that was the least of his worries. Muriel did not belong in Hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn what charges?\u201d Crowley demanded, furiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel knew not to do miracles outside of their assigned duties. But they did anyway. I went to deal with this, but apparently the Metatron decided to pull the Earth Observation files he\u2019d been quietly gathering. He made it known that Muriel was spending a great deal of time with you and that it was a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat difference does it make if Muriel talks with me? I\u2019m not affiliated with Hell anymore!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gulped. \u201cHe\u2019s actually been running a bit of a PR campaign against you, and all demons. He\u2019s determined to keep angels and demons very separate after what happened with Gabriel. I think- I think <i>he</i> thinks that if he shows that even an angel like Muriel can be tempted, no angel is safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can we do to stop this?\u201d Crowley whispered urgently. \u201cThere must be something? It\u2019s all my fault, I can go to the Metatron-!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not, Crowley! They\u2019ll erase you, they\u2019re looking for any reason to, that\u2019s why I need you to flee! Muriel is my responsibility anyway. I put them up to all this in the first place.\u201d Aziraphale was truly miserable.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told them to give you my diaries. So you knew how I felt, even if I couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley balked at the angel. Then laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel is an actual madman,\u201d he said, admiringly. \u201cHere I thought all this time they were working with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he remembered. Muriel was the third member of <i>their</i> side.</p>\n<p>Muriel was always working them both. And for them both. Muriel was always working <i>with</i> them both.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go get them, we have to do something.\u201d Crowley stood, pulling Aziraphale by the hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Crowley! I have to do something, and you need to hide!\u201d Aziraphale sounded extremely firm. His time leading Heaven seemed to have strengthened his spine a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Crowley spit back.</p>\n<p>But at that moment, the gateway flashed a violent white, and Muriel came leaping out of it, looking wild.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel!\u201d Crowley gasped. \u201cWhat the hell are you- how did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTold myself I could,\u201d they replied, breathless, hands on their knees.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale gaped. \u201cBut how did you travel through the gateway without discorporating? Even I couldn\u2019t do that, I took the stairs\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTold myself I could,\u201d Muriel said again, huffing, as if that explained everything, and suddenly, it did.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, would you look at that,\u201d Crowley breathed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe ought to get moving, I think,\u201d Muriel gasped, clutching a stitch in their side. \u201cThe Metatron is not going to be pleased when he wakes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen he-??\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cWakes up???!\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>Muriel just nodded, still trying to catch their breath.</p>\n<p>Crowley was terrified and entirely impressed. \u201cMuriel, what have you done?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that you\u2019re holding?\u201d Asked Aziraphale, suddenly incredibly serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, this?\u201d Muriel finally stood up straight, opening their coat wide and pulling out a large tome.</p>\n<p>In the grand hierarchy of all beings, God resided firmly at the top. And now, just underneath her, but above all others, sat one former Scrivener, 37th class, armed with unimaginable power.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knicked it,\u201d they said guiltily, holding up The Book of Life.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou WHAT?\u201d Crowley and Aziraphale said together, one grinning massively and the other stricken, neither fully believing what Muriel said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Muriel said. They had finally caught their breath after so much running, but panic kept each breath shallow. \u201cBelieve me, I had to, he was-\u201c</p>\n<p>The gateway behind them sparked. \u201cWe really should be going, right away, I think. Probably best not to do any miracles either,\u201d Muriel said apologetically.</p>\n<p>Crowley made to follow Muriel, who was grabbing a few items on their way out the door, when Aziraphale pulled him back by the arm.</p>\n<p>He was hushed but panicked. \u201cCrowley, this is- this is an unimaginable crime. We don\u2019t have to go with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley looked at Aziraphale as if he\u2019d gone mad. \u201cWhat? \u2018Course we do, they\u2019ll never get out of this themselves. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt may be too late for Muriel to evade punishment, but not you. You still have time to run!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey need our help,\u201d Crowley said simply, and Aziraphale released him. \u201cWe\u2019re helping. At least I am, anyway.\u201d He walked quickly to the door before turning back. \u201cYou coming or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s voice was steady, but his expression was fierce. Aziraphale felt he could burn holes through his glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>The angel looked around helplessly for a moment, trying to determine what next move would be best. He had a feeling whatever damage control he attempted in Heaven would not be well-received, but maybe he could mitigate the worst of it if\u2014</p>\n<p>Muriel rushed back in the door to grab a blue book, then stopped, catching sight of the frozen angel.</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale? Aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>Their voice was so soft.</p>\n<p>Of course Aziraphale was coming. He moved quickly to follow them both out the shop door.</p>\n<p>It was all rather incredible, Aziraphale realized, getting into the passenger side of the Bentley. How had things changed so much since Aziraphale sheltered Jim that Aziraphale would now be the one shirking away from danger while Crowley volunteered to protect against it?</p>\n<p>He looked over at Crowley, overwhelmed by love.</p>\n<p>Crowley looked back at him and huffed, cheeks going red. \u201cAngel, now\u2019s not the time for that. I\u2019ll never be able to start driving if you give me that face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, with Aziraphale looking firmly ahead, the Bentley flew down High Holborn, quite nearly flew, as Aziraphale and Crowley argued over what to do. In the backseat, smushed between shivering potted plants, Muriel clutched The Book of Life tightly, laughing in disbelief one moment and groaning with regret the next.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you are miracling this car to go faster, I must insist you STOP at ONCE!\u201d Aziraphale shouted, clutching the dashboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it! She\u2019s just as scared as we are!\u201d Crowley shouted back, his hands on the steering wheel, knuckles white.</p>\n<p>Muriel bobbed blankly about in the backseat, letting the car move their body however it wanted to. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely going to erase me, aren\u2019t they?\u201d They were queasy, and it had nothing to do with Crowley\u2019s driving.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale shot a look back at them, shooting for sympathy but landing firmly in irritation. \u201cThey\u2019re going to erase <i> us</i>, Muriel,\u201d he corrected.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s only if they can catch us!\u201d Crowley declared roguishly, taking a turn far too fast. Aziraphale squealed in terror, harmonizing shrilly with the Bentley\u2019s screeching tires. A potted shrub fell over, battering him with hundreds of tiny sticks and leaves.</p>\n<p>\u201cWHY are your plants here, Crowley?\u201d Aziraphale demanded, spitting out a leaf and pushing the offending plant back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, they weren\u2019t happy in the flat. I couldn\u2019t get all the <i>Shaxness</i> out.\u201d Crowley turned back and glanced at the plants. \u201cThey\u2019re recovering, but,\u201d a growl took over his voice. \u201c\u2026<i>not fast enough.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCROWLEY! THE ROAD! FOR GOD\u2019S SAKE, KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Muriel asked, trying to focus on anything but what they\u2019d done. The chaos was helpful, but did nothing for Muriel\u2019s taut nerves.</p>\n<p>\u201cAway,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cWe\u2019ll know when we get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel sat back, resigned. They couldn\u2019t use a miracle to travel, as any miracle could alert Heaven of their whereabouts. Muriel\u2019s impulsiveness had doomed them all. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d they cried.</p>\n<p>Crowley laughed weakly. \u201cTell you the truth, Inspector, I\u2019m not sure this is a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a bad thing?\u201d Aziraphale chuckled humorlessly and yet somehow also hysterically, flinging his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re right! It\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s the worst possible thing.\u201d After a beat, he turned back to Muriel. \u201cI do forgive you, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley waved an index finger at Aziraphale, looking over at the angel before said angel promptly pushed his face back to the road. \u201cThink about it! We can\u2019t be erased now that we\u2019ve got the book! We can make people- ANYONE- disappear from all existence! Who would dare mess with us now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod would, I think?\u201d Muriel replied, ashen-faced.</p>\n<p>Crowley stopped talking.</p>\n<p>They drove in alert silence, as if God might make a warning sound, a trumpet noise or a heavenly chorus or a bird call, before smiting them off the face of the planet. They heard nothing beyond the roar of the Bentley and the soft shivering of the leaves.</p>\n<p>They passed the time as such for hours. The sun began to rise behind them, rays stretching over wind turbine-dotted fields.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Crowley suddenly, causing his passengers to jump, \u201cIs why the Book of Life was out in the first place. Don\u2019t they keep that thing locked up somewhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Muriel sighed lifelessly. \u201cHe was going to make changes to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Metatron was going to erase you? Oh, Muriel.\u201c Aziraphale was truly sorry.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he said he was going to make <i>changes,</i> he said. Edits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Crowley shook his head. \u201cHe can\u2019t make changes to the Book. All he can do is erase people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel shook their head back. \u201c<i>No,</i> he can change what\u2019s written there. Swap one adjective for another adjective. He did it to you, Crowley. Don\u2019t you remember? He did it to all the fallen angels.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s jaw tightened. He remembered changing, falling, being an angel in one moment and a demon the next, but he did not recall what exactly changed him. He assumed God snapped their celestial fingers\u2026or something?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean at God\u2019s command, of course,\u201d Aziraphale said shakily.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>No,</i> he can just do it. Didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked at Crowley hastily, who shook his head.</p>\n<p>This information changed everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we didn\u2019t know, how on earth do you know?\u201d Aziraphale tried his best not to come across insulting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a scrivener. I record what happens. On Earth, in the Heavens. If God speaks to the Metatron, I\u2019d know. We record everything God says directly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen was the last time that happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe said \u2018I have glorified it and will glorify it again\u2019. She was talking to Jesus about Heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that was like two thousand years ago!\u201d Crowley protested. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right! You can\u2019t just build all this,\u201d Crowley gesticulated frantically, \u201cAnd just abandon it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just been the Metatron this whole time since then,\u201d Aziraphale breathed, voice heavy with astonishment.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Crowley trying to understand. \u201cThe Metatron has just been doing whatever he likes, for who knows how long, and God either doesn\u2019t know or doesn\u2019t care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Muriel said softly. Crowley exhaled hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can we know for sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Aziraphale worked it out aloud. \u201cIf erasing people is something the book is able to do, then God wouldn\u2019t need a book to do it. God would just do it. That\u2019s what the word <i>almighty</i> means. The Metatron is God\u2019s voice, not God\u2019s will. If the Metatron is using the book to erase people or cast them into Hell, then it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s not God\u2019s will at all and never was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s just as possible that She doesn\u2019t care one way or another,\u201d Crowley said bitterly.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale furrowed his brow, deep in thought.</p>\n<p>They passed a sign reading, Woolfardisworthy, and Aziraphale gasped. \u201cGo there!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley leered at him. \u201cWhat for? Why Woolfard-is-worthy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Woolsery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s never?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Aziraphale continued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s perfect. Even if an angel, or demon, as it were, were to find us, they\u2019d have to know how to pronounce the town properly in order to direct others here using typical supernatural travel methods. At least, that\u2019s how it works when viewing the Earth from Heaven. Let\u2019s say you\u2019d like to go to Berkeley Square, for instance, but you\u2019re unaccustomed to London and you pronounce Berkeley by sounding it out, you\u2019ll wind up somewhere in San Francisco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley groaned. The logic was tenuous at best.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, I guess we\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d Crowley grumbled. \u201cStill, I can\u2019t understand why humans would invent a whole language and then not follow any of its rules.\u201d He peered in the rearview. \u201cWhat\u2019re you up to back there, Muriel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d they said anxiously, angling their diary downwards to show the page. \u201cDoodling, I suppose. I\u2019ve never seen Earth outside of London.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, these are very good, indeed!\u201d Aziraphale exclaimed, looking at them over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the talent. Do let me look them over later, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Muriel blushed, looking very pleased, an inkling of an idea forming in their mind. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have plenty of artistic inspiration here. Old villages, lovely beaches, fields of wispy grass,\u201d he rolled the window down and breathed deeply. \u201cAnd the clarifying smell of the sea. You can only just detect it now, but wait til we get closer. Lovely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley grimaced. \u201cOh sure, yeah, lovely indeed! No lovelier place to be hunted by, who was it again? Oh yes, the entire Heavenly host!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the entire Heavenly host,\u201d Aziraphale murmured. \u201cI <i>am</i> the Supreme Archangel, in case you forgot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHadn\u2019t,\u201d Crowley snarled. \u201cJust don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel wasn\u2019t keen to watch the two lose the precious emotional ground they\u2019d made up in the last few hours. Something needed to be done.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a beach!\u201d They suggested, lifting up a bag. \u201cI brought a few bottles of wine. We can have a picnic!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked over his shoulder, disdain in his voice. \u201cMuriel, two bottles of wine does not a picnic make. Also, it\u2019s 6:43 in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA daybreak, wine-only picnic is the only kind I\u2019m interested in,\u201d Crowley replied, a bit scathingly. \u201cGreat idea, Constable.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Bentley turned down a country road, and within moments they beheld the glorious blue sea crashing mildly against the sandy shore, the beach miraculously (well, not <i> actually</i>) empty. Muriel leapt out of the car, Book of Life in one hand, tote bag in the other, and raced towards the water.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale was right about the ocean air. The weight of the worry Muriel carried seemed to lessen, as though the wind lifted it away and out to sea. All around them, long grasses waved, welcoming them, and gulls called out from the skies.\u201cHello,\u201d they seemed to say, diving around each other, dancing for Muriel.</p>\n<p>At least, that\u2019s how Muriel saw it. They\u2019d never seen the sea before- not from Earth anyway.</p>\n<p>The effect was not felt as potently by the other members of Muriel\u2019s traveling party. Aziraphale was still in his suit slacks and dress shirt, and Crowley never wore anything suitable for sand. They trudged down to meet Muriel (already sketching a pair of gulls), looking thoroughly out of place.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are three wine bottles,\u201d Muriel said, not looking up. \u201cHelp yourself!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale scowled as he sat down by the tote bag. No one had ever invited him to help himself to his <i>own wine</i>. He pulled out a lovely vintage and realized Muriel had grabbed wines that were both very expensive and very rare.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was their last opportunity to drink, he thought miserably. Might as well go out with style.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a corkscrew,\u201d Aziraphale realized aloud, never having needed one before.</p>\n<p>Crowley produced sleek black multitool. Aziraphale looked at him questioningly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good cover, in case I need to pretend I fixed something without anyone asking questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d He brushed sand from his hands and took the tool.</p>\n<p>Crowley sat beside him. The chaos and energy of the last few hours had weathered and dulled into something else. Resentment sat at the forefront of his mind. Its source sat in the sand beside him.</p>\n<p>So Aziraphale was back beside him. So Crowley knew how the angel felt. But Aziraphale had never said the words aloud. And they were the words of an angel who had never been kissed.</p>\n<p>What was Aziraphale thinking now that they had kissed? Did the Aziraphale in the sand believe Crowley deserved more of an explanation, more of a response beyond <i>I forgive you</i>? Or would Aziraphale make Crowley do all the hard parts again, and as always?</p>\n<p>Aziraphale passed Crowley a bottle.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheers,\u201d Crowley said, and without waiting for Aziraphale to finish opening his own, he clinked their bottles together. He poured the wine down his throat, far too much and far too fast, knowing this would scandalize the angel.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo reunions,\u201d Aziraphale said uneasily.</p>\n<p>Muriel sketched steadily, but that didn\u2019t mean they were unaware of the veritable sea of tension behind them.</p>\n<p>Perhaps they hadn\u2019t been on Earth long enough. Perhaps they hadn\u2019t gone native. Whatever the reason Muriel felt completely devoid of romantic or sexual interest, they couldn\u2019t help but feel very blessed to not suffer the way Crowley and Aziraphale did. It sometimes seemed like the two of them chose this pain. They were <i>finally</i> in the same place. A romantic one, at that! And instead of doing, well, whatever it was they <i>ought</i> to be doing (Kissing? Caressing? For God\u2019s sake, <i>talking</i> at the very least?), they were were sitting beside each other, taciturn and messy. If this meant Muriel had to clean things up, well, then Muriel would do what they had to.</p>\n<p>Of course, Muriel knew they ought to be focused on other things. After all, they were in the worst trouble of their existence. But it was <i>scary</i> to think about, so they really rather wouldn\u2019t. Devoting their brainpower, even if just for a moment or two, to their original scheme was a needed escape from\u2026.all this nonsense to do with putting the Metatron to sleep.</p>\n<p>Life had never been so complicated before they first stepped foot on Earth.</p>\n<p>A plan was coming together in their mind, but it was devious. It was risky. But (and Muriel was sure of this) it was necessary. As a student of romantic literature, Muriel determined it was the most viable path forward. There was little time to waste.</p>\n<p>They finished the last few details on a very important sketch before slamming their diary shut and standing up. They stretched and groaned, making sure to draw attention to themselves, then turned to face the pair in the sand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you open the wine, Crowley?\u201d Muriel asked, walking towards him with a bit of wiggle in their hips and a hand extended.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, er,\u201d Crowley replied. \u201cFew moments ago.\u201d Crowley understood that Muriel wanted his wine bottle, but didn\u2019t understand why they would share it when a third bottle sat unopened. He passed it to them anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Crowley!\u201d Muriel flashed a peppy smile, then slowly tilted the bottle back into their mouth, maintaining eye contact with Crowley as they drank. They punctuated the swig with a half glance at Aziraphale, who, unlike Crowley, very much noticed the entire display and the intention behind it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley, are those ducks as well?\u201d Muriel wasn\u2019t an idiot- they knew they were gulls- but they pointed excitedly at the birds a few yards down the beach with a bubbly giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, some kind of seabird,\u201d Crowley replied disinterestedly, sparing them a look and taking his wine bottle back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose are gulls, Mur-\u201c Aziraphale started.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s look at them!\u201d Muriel said, cutting Aziraphale off entirely and grabbing Crowley\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can see them well enough from here!\u201d Crowley replied with a groan. But Muriel tugged persistently, so he rose with a begrudging \u201cFine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll watch our stuff, right?\u201d Muriel asked Aziraphale in a manner that was rather less a question and more a statement, tossing their diary towards Aziraphale and spraying his torso with sand. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel pulled Crowley along, urgently whispering \u201cCrowley, do NOT look back at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha-?\u201d Crowley allowed himself to be dragged. He had no idea what was going on but had the sense to follow Muriel\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p>It was a good thing, too, that Crowley did not look back. He very well may have been turned into a pillar of salt by the Archangel, currently staring daggers at the pair of them and beside himself with fury.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d Crowley whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe plan, Crowley! Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d Muriel whispered back. \u201cWOW, these birds are LOVELY,\u201d they shouted, angling their chin just slightly to the side, hoping Aziraphale would hear. The birds in question were fighting noisily over the shredded carcass of a crab.</p>\n<p>Crowley stared at Muriel as though they had lost their mind. \u201cWe have more important things to worry about right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel wasn\u2019t listening. They grabbed Crowley\u2019s lapel for a moment, tossing their head back in a laugh, before suddenly turning quite serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am going to push you. This is called flirting. I need you to laugh, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No! Don\u2019t push me!\u201d Crowley said shrilly, hands raised to defend himself.</p>\n<p>But it was too late. With a glittering laugh, Muriel pushed Crowley, who immediately tried to dodge, failed, and fell face first into the sand.</p>\n<p>He laid there for a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d Muriel laughed for real this time, tickled by how unexpectedly easy it was to knock the demon over. They really had <i>barely</i> pushed.</p>\n<p>Resolutely <i>not</i> flirting, Crowley lashed back out at Muriel, striking towards them like a snake and grabbing their ankle, sending them into the sand as well. Muriel screeched with fear, but quickly turned the sound into one of playfulness. Crowley crawled towards them, spitting sand out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell, Muriel? What\u2019s gotten into you?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, this is perfect. Aziraphale is going to go entirely insane, I promise you,\u201d Muriel squealed hastily, hands protecting their face, palms out in surrender.</p>\n<p>Crowley looked up. Indeed, Aziraphale looked about ready to kill. He took a long gulp of wine and set the bottle down slowly, staring at Crowley murderously. Crowley felt his insides go cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is this helping us exactly?\u201d He asked through gritted teeth, sitting back on his legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Muriel replied. \u201cJust trust me.\u201d Muriel stood and held out their hand in a peace offering. \u201cHe looks, um\u2026mad. Or rather, furious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him make that face before,\u201d was all Crowley could say.</p>\n<p>They stood, shaking sand off their bodies, and approached Aziraphale once more. Crowley felt desperately uncomfortable, so he turned towards the sea and walked a few paces towards it.</p>\n<p>That left only Muriel and Aziraphale together. Muriel braced themselves.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for keeping that safe,\u201d Muriel said, too brightly. They were disappointed to see that Aziraphale had not opened Muriel\u2019s diary.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Aziraphale said, not looking at them.</p>\n<p>Muriel picked up the diary by the edge and opened it slightly, confirming they had opened it to the right page.</p>\n<p>This next move could be very dangerous indeed, Muriel thought, but they hadn\u2019t spent all that time sketching for nothing. They stumbled slightly and dropped the open diary on the sand between them, making sure to toss it in such a way that Aziraphale couldn\u2019t possibly miss what was on the page.</p>\n<p>Lovingly shaded, clad in skintight jeans, was a sketch of one familiar, spectacular arse.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoops,\u201d Muriel said, ears turning red as they snatched up the diary and hugged it to their chest. Their heart beat madly. They didn\u2019t dare look at Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>The sketch was just a trap, a ploy, but it embarrassed Muriel just as much as if they\u2019d drawn it for personal pleasure. At that moment, they understood that this plan was indeed torture, by all definitions, for all parties.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t say anything. He looked at Muriel, struggling to form words.</p>\n<p>At that moment, Crowley rejoined the group. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the face?\u201d He asked Aziraphale bluntly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think- I think it\u2019s all this sea air,\u201d Aziraphale said, fanning himself. \u201cOr too much wine, perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel felt a pang of guilt. This would all be worth it when they got together, Muriel reminded themselves.</p>\n<p>They were, all of them, silent for a moment, staring at the sea.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we look for lodging?\u201d The timber of Aziraphale\u2019s voice was suddenly brighter than usual. Much brighter.</p>\n<p>Crowley didn\u2019t notice it, or perhaps he noticed but didn\u2019t catch the significance of the change, but Muriel knew. Muriel had read enough books to know that this was an indication of resolve, or even of challenge. It was the voice of an angel who had taken stock of the situation before him and found it entirely unacceptable. It was the voice of an angel who was pushed to the edge of comfort and returned with a plan to finally pick up the pace.</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled, trying very hard to make sure Aziraphale didn\u2019t see, feeling very relieved.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose we should,\u201d Crowley agreed, making his way to the Bentley.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter you, my dear,\u201d said Aziraphale cordially to Muriel, but the energy around him seemed to crackle. Muriel gulped.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Within only a few minutes of puttering down the road, they found a lovely seaside lodge. The restaurant beckoned them especially; the smell of fresh bread and lobster was enough to almost make Aziraphale forget their \u201cpicnic\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ll check in at the front desk. You two find a table and keep your heads down,\u201d Crowley said, peering around them for signs of ethereal activity. \u201cAnd do not let that book out of your sight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Aziraphale replied. \u201cCome along, Muriel.\u201d</p>\n<p>He caught their eye a moment, and Muriel suddenly felt very small beside Aziraphale, who they liked very much, and who didn\u2019t like them very much back at this moment. Muriel tried to make small talk as they walked towards <i>The Stone Frigate</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe seaside is lovely, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Muriel tried first.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfectly so, yes,\u201d Aziraphale inhaled. \u201cThat ocean breeze really goes to one\u2019s head, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d There was the slightest hint of an accusation there.</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded, smiling nervously. \u201cOh yes! I\u2019m silly with it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d Aziraphale replied cooly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been to this restaurant before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, dear, I regularly travel four hours west to dine here at <i> The Stone Frigate</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Muriel smiled, but their voice was sad. \u201cSarcasm, yes. Crowley taught me about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley seems to have taught you a lot,\u201d Aziraphale remarked, opening the restaurant door.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, he\u2019s been a massive help. There\u2019s so much to learn. I haven\u2019t tried much, um, food? But I think I would like to eat what I can now, while I can, just in case\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a chip in his armor, and Aziraphale\u2019s innate warmth won. \u201cOh my dear, I will find you whatever on this menu is best, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Though it wasn\u2019t <i>The Ritz</i>, the restaurant was everything a seaside eatery ought to be. The walls were covered with pictures of fisher people and the prizes they caught. Every surface was made of wood, either painted or covered in shiny pitch, and each step made the floorboards creak. It was something like being on a ship.</p>\n<p>It had been ages since Aziraphale had traveled on a wooden ship. He rather liked it, living a life of adventure. He had gone aboard as a priest.</p>\n<p>And luckily so, as he was therefore the only crew member spared by the pirates who commandeered his ship five days into its maiden voyage- never mind that Crowley happened to be their captain.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale willed the memory of a long-haired, sun-kissed, radiantly-freckled Crowley from his mind and returned to the present. On the wall beside the host counter, a large sign listed the catches of the day. \u2018Lobster\u2019 was circled in red. Aziraphale loved lobster.</p>\n<p>A young man met them at the counter, fumbling over his words and blushing furiously at Muriel as he led them to a table overlooking the sea. Aziraphale would have found it terribly endearing- on another day.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was nice!\u201d Muriel remarked jovially. \u201cAnd he gave us bread!\u201d</p>\n<p>A basket of golden, steaming rolls sat before them. Aziraphale groaned happily at the smell.</p>\n<p>He took a roll in his hand, cut it open with a knife, and spread a dollop of butter there. He noticed Muriel studying him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, have you had bread?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel shook their head but licked their lips. \u201cI only eat foods in liquids. Like soup. Or cucumbers from Pimm\u2019s Cups. Or cherries from-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, we know, from Shirley <i>bloody</i> Temples! Always on about those cherries!\u201d Crowley said, walking up to the table and sitting beside Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>He placed a sherry in front of Aziraphale, who noticed Crowley had not brought a drink for himself. Or for Muriel, for that matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLooked like you needed one,\u201d Crowley said, not meeting the angel\u2019s eye, and Aziraphale bloomed a little bit. \u201cYou ordered yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet, but Muriel is entrusting me to pick out something for them that they\u2019ll like.\u201d Aziraphale looked over at Muriel warmly for a split second, then remembered to adjust his face a degree or two cooler.</p>\n<p>Muriel, who had not stopped studying the bread, hadn\u2019t noticed.</p>\n<p>Crowley, studying Aziraphale, had.</p>\n<p>The waiter returned, stuttering again. \u201cWh-what c-can I-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, I\u2019ll take the strongest coffee you\u2019ve got,\u201d Crowley interrupted. \u201cNothing else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale smiled kindly at the young man. \u201cI\u2019d like the lobster tail please. In fact, two; one for me and one for my friend here. They\u2019d also like an order of bou-boy-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cBoilsyba-bou,\u201d Crowley attempted to help.</p>\n<p>\u201cBouillabaisse?\u201d Muriel finished perfectly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat,\u201d Crowley said defeatedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that,\u201d Aziraphale concurred, pretending it did not bother him that Muriel nailed it on the first try.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be out shortly,\u201d the waiter said, not looking at anyone and turning away quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat human likes you, Muriel,\u201d Crowley said, watching the boy\u2019s back. \u201cThey all seem to, now that I think about it. They\u2019re always winking or tripping all over themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what that means?\u201d Muriel exclaimed loudly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure it out! Remember at the Goat Tavern, when\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s attention slipped. He had never really heard Crowley, who was laughing and nodding along to Muriel\u2019s recollection, talk like this. Crowley never seemed to care enough to remember.</p>\n<p>It became clear to Aziraphale that Muriel was important. Was special. Crowley was fond of them. Of course he was; he had offered to stay and help them at the risk of his own immortal peril. The only other person he\u2019d done that for was-</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale? Did you hear me?\u201d Crowley said, snapping in front of the angel\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dear, I\u2019m afraid not. Lost in my thoughts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was telling Muriel about that time Job\u2019s boy came on to you, do you remember?\u201d Crowley\u2019s smile was luminous as he tossed his head back and laughed at the memory.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale blushed. \u201cI rather think he was just\u2026outgoing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was definitely <i>out</i>, alright,\u201d Crowley laughed again. \u201cNever did find out where he was going.\u201d</p>\n<p>The conversation flowed naturally, and Aziraphale couldn\u2019t help but feel reluctantly awed by it all. He\u2019d never expected to dine with Crowley with a third party involved, and certainly not one who was, somehow, unobtrusive. Aside from Muriel\u2019s obvious pash on Crowley, Aziraphale found their company enjoyable.</p>\n<p>The food arrived; Aziraphale and Crowley both laughed at the expression on Muriel\u2019s face when they were served the lobster. The bouillabaisse smelled wonderful, and was a soup, so Muriel started there.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry it with this,\u201d Aziraphale said, passing a buttered roll to Muriel. \u201cDip it in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel obeyed. The bread was remarkable; Muriel made that clear without saying a word.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlow down there, Scrivener,\u201d Crowley said, glancing over at Muriel with slight disgust.</p>\n<p>He returned his gaze back to where he\u2019d really wanted it. Aziraphale delicately cut a small sliver of lobster tail, already dripping with lemon juice, and dipped it lightly into a cup of drawn butter.</p>\n<p>He slowly brought the lobster to his lips. In the space of a millisecond, the angel flicked his eyes towards Crowley. Then he slid the fork into his mouth, moaning decadently as he chewed.</p>\n<p>Elbow on the table and chin in his hand, the faintest smile playing on the corner of his lip, Crowley lost himself in looking at Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething on my face, dear?\u201d Aziraphale asked coyly.</p>\n<p>Crowley straightened up, startled. Muriel temporarily paused their ravenous attack on the soup to giggle at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe lobster,\u201d Crowley choked. \u201cIt, it looks nice. Haven\u2019t had lobster in a hundred years, at least, and it wasn\u2019t even fashionable then. Not served with drawn butter in those days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Aziraphale said, extending a fork towards Crowley, a perfect piece of lobster stuck to the end, just a little too large to be proper.</p>\n<p>Crowley leaned in, opening his mouth wide to accommodate the morsel, yellow eyes staring intently at the angel\u2019s from behind his dark glasses. Aziraphale took his time extending the fork, wanting Crowley to lean even closer.</p>\n<p>The demon\u2019s lips closed over the lobster and he pulled back, dragging the meat off the fork with him. Neither broke their gaze for a moment, but the pull of Crowley\u2019s mouth was too much for Aziraphale. It was his turn to stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Crowley finally said, dabbing his mouth with a napkin. Aziraphale exhaled heavily, realizing he\u2019d been holding his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019should try th\u2019bread, \u2018s delicious,\u201d Muriel suggested, mouth full. The moment was lost.</p>\n<p>They finished their lunch shortly after, Muriel eating their lobster tail with as much restraint as the gulls on the beach had shown to their crab. They headed towards their rooms, which ran parallel to the sea, and Muriel was besides themselves.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a \u2018room\u2019 before,\u201d they said, smiling hugely. \u201cJust someone else\u2019s shop! I think I may try,\u201d they giggled mischievously, \u201cjumping on the bed!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds great, Muriel, you enjoy that. Here you are,\u201d Crowley said cooly, passing out keys. \u201cYou\u2019re in room 22 here. Aziraphale, we\u2019re in room 23.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale spluttered, going instantly red. \u201cWe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d Crowley asked, eyebrow raised, opening the door to the room and revealing two queen beds. There was a door on the left wall, which Crowley promptly opened. Muriel poked their head through joyously.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, how lucky! It\u2019s like we\u2019ve got one big room! I\u2019ve never had roommates!\u201d</p>\n<p>A conjoined room and two beds were not what Aziraphale had imagined for their first time sharing a hotel room. More crucially, Muriel was not involved whatsoever in this fantasy.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, bring that book here, would you?\u201d Crowley said, beginning to pace, peeling off his jacket. Aziraphale tried not to stare and busied himself with his wrinkled button up shirt.</p>\n<p>Muriel produced The Book of Life and set it on the bed nearest Crowley. The two of them gathered around it, while Aziraphale watched from his own bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we open it?\u201d asked Crowley hesitantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you see, I tried already,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cOnly I couldn\u2019t get it to open on Earth. It only opened for a moment, back while I was still in Heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>At this, Crowley tried to flip the front cover open, but it didn\u2019t budge.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re up, <i>Supreme Archangel,</i>\u201d Crowley said, passing the book to Aziraphale. He glared in reply to the waspish tone.</p>\n<p>At his touch, the book opened- only to the first page.</p>\n<p>Two words were written there;<br>\n<i><br>\n<s>ENOCH</s></i></p>\n<p>\n<i>METATRON<br>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>The book would open no further.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, drat! They must\u2019ve locked it,\u201d Aziraphale said as Crowley slumped back onto the bed. What good was a Book of Life that didn\u2019t open?</p>\n<p>\u201cEnoch sounds familiar,\u201d Aziraphale said, brow furrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s just the Metatron,\u201d Muriel said dismissively. \u201cHis original name, you know, from when he was human?\u201d*</p>\n<p>Crowley laughed. \u201cMuriel, that\u2019s an old rumor we made up in Hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel shook their head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m certain actually that Enoch was a man. He lived to be 365. He\u2019s the only man to never die, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you said he only lived to 365,\u201d Aziraphale said, chortling. \u201cI think we\u2019d know about a 365 year old human.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Muriel nodded, understanding the confusion. \u201cWhat I meant is that he lived to be 365 on Earth. After that, God pulled him into Heaven. And he never died! He just sort of\u2026became the Metatron.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked at Muriel with increasing concern. \u201cHumans don\u2019t become angels when they ascend, Muriel. You know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel looked down at their feet. \u201cOh, right. Of course. Silly me. I don\u2019t know why I said that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They tried the book a few more times before Muriel decided to see if they could figure out how to work a television- a device they\u2019d only ever read about in books. Returning to their room, Muriel gave Crowley a weighty glance and then closed the door that separated them.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere changed in an instant. Crowley and Aziraphale each sat on their respective beds, not wanting to be the one to speak first.</p>\n<p>After a few moments, Crowley laid back with a sigh and wiggled out of his shoes. It took more effort than he expected; it had been a very long time since he\u2019d removed his shoes manually. He realized how much he took miracles for granted.</p>\n<p>Watching Crowley wriggling on a bed was too much for the angel, so after a few moments, Aziraphale broke. \u201cIt\u2019s been ages since I was last in Devon. I\u2019d forgotten how pleasant it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley simply turned his head and looked at the angel.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever been? I\u2019m sure you have, but-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cSpare me the small talk, Angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s heart leapt. Crowley had used the word so sparingly in the day since they\u2019d been reunited.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there something you\u2019d rather we discuss instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley scowled at the answer. He was sick of Aziraphale constantly making him be the one to talk about <i> real things</i> first.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Never mind. I\u2019m going to nap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Crowley!\u201d Aziraphale scolded. His breath hitched for a moment, as though trying to gather the courage to continue speaking. He swallowed. \u201cWhat can I possibly say? Because I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry for going to Heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo? Not sorry for it?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was a low growl.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale steamed. \u201cYou\u2019ve read my diaries, actual paper copies of my heart, and you haven\u2019t- you haven\u2019t even mentioned it. What can I possibly say to you that you haven\u2019t already read?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley sat up, angry. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I read the words of an angel who thought he wanted something, then <i>forgave me</i> once he got it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou rejected me,\u201d Aziraphale said quickly, heatedly. \u201cYou rejected me and then you kissed me immediately after. You punished me, Crowley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPunished? Rejected?\u201d Crowley was on his feet now, arms flailing. \u201cI asked you to run away with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale scoffed furiously. \u201cAnd how could I? I had an opportunity to keep you safe, FINALLY, for the first time since you fell. I didn\u2019t want to go back to Heaven, I didn\u2019t want to become an Archangel!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes sense why you\u2019d invite me along, then!\u201d Crowley said sarcastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand it was torture? And I knew, I knew you would never agree to come back as an angel. But I had to ask. Because may-,\u201c all the fury in his voice broke apart, leaving only wistful regret. \u201cMaybe you would\u2019ve said yes and we would never have needed to be separated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale huffed, his big blue eyes watery but his voice steady once more. \u201cAll I\u2019ve wanted, for such a terribly long time, is to drink tea in our bookshop and then go for Sunday drives in the Bentley. To go to <i>The Ritz</i> so I can watch you while you watch me. To holiday in Alpha Centauri. To feed ducks peas with you at St. James Park. To bicker with you about my silly fascinations or where in the shop you should put your latest addition to your plant collection. To kiss you in the bandstand during the rain.\u201d He paused, catching his breath, then fixed his eyes determinedly upon Crowley\u2019s, who only then realized he\u2019d taken his glasses off. \u201cFor as long as we both shall live.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley only stared at him, stunned speechless.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd maybe- maybe you\u2019ve thought about\u2026about moving on. Maybe I\u2019ve caused this to break irreparably. But I pray I haven\u2019t, because I can\u2019t imagine existing without you, Crowley. I do believe I\u2019d rather be erased.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoving on?\u201d Crowley didn\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked at him, anguished, and collapsed on the bed, cradling his face in his hands. \u201cMuriel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Angel,\u201d Crowley grinned widely, covered his own face in his hands, and fell back against the bed beside Aziraphale. \u201cYou lovely, silly idiot. You couldn\u2019t have possibly believed that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked over at him, confused and offended.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate to break it to you,\u201d Crowley began with a giggle. \u201cBut Muriel,\u201d he paused to laugh. \u201cMuriel had you fooled. Hook, line, and sinker. Or what was that phrase you liked? Played for a sucker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stood quickly, shocked. He was silent for a beat. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley could only nod, giggling too much to speak at the look on Aziraphale\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean they don\u2019t-\u201c Aziraphale whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh uh,\u201d Crowley replied, trying to contain a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m astonished you bought it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s- that\u2019s-! That\u2019s utterly devious!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBorderline evil, right?\u201d Crowley wheezed, wiping away a tear. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean it was <i>Muriel\u2019s</i> idea? The get-togethers? The duck feeding? The sketch of your arse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell now, you drew that, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale clapped his hands to his face in shock. Crowley didn\u2019t even <i>know</i> about that sketch. Muriel seemed to have gone rogue.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re quite sure Muriel is not infatuated with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Crowley grinned. \u201cI think Muriel feels as much romantic interest for others as you feel for <i>The Sound of Music</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale exhaled heavily. He had greatly underestimated the scrivener.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this was a plot,\u201d Aziraphale said, hands on his hips. \u201cAnd you went along with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, I mostly stood around doing what Muriel told me to.\u201d Crowley shrugged. \u201cThey read all your books, so I trusted they knew what they were doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that moment, there was a knock on the door conjoining their room. Muriel opened it slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a good time, Muriel,\u201d Crowley called to them, but Aziraphale strode over and clasped their hands.\n\u201cMuriel, you wiley little scamp, I\u2019m astonished! However did you come up with your little ruse? You had me completely fooled!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good. You finally know,\u201d Muriel spoke as thought attempting to sound relieved, but couldn\u2019t quite muster it. \u201cListen, I\u2019m very sorry for-for interrupting,\u201d Muriel continued softly, \u201cbut I think there may be a demon in the telly? Is that normal? He told me to stay put. That they\u2019re coming for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p>\n<p>Two minutes and twenty-six seconds later, Crowley, Aziraphale and Muriel were back in the Bentley, racing madly away from the little inn. Muriel clung tightly to The Book of Life, as thought it could somehow save them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to know EXACTLY what the demon said,\u201d Crowley hissed, scanning everywhere for the first signs of demonic activity.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said something like,\u201d Muriel adopted a strange voice. \u201c\u2018You must be Muriel, the angel who managed to evade sentencing.\u2019 And I said \u2018sentencing?\u2019\u201d Muriel reverted to their normal voice and then back to the strange one again. \u201c\u2018You know, you were sentenced to Fall, but you ran instead. Hell wants what\u2019s ours.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he mention the book?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel shook their head. \u201cNo. No mention of the book at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeaven doesn\u2019t want them to know,\u201d Crowley breathed.</p>\n<p>At exactly that moment, a BANG rattled the car. The Bentley swerved erratically off the road and into a dusty field. Whether by demonic intervention or otherwise, her back left tire had popped.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck,\u201d muttered Aziraphale as Crowley tried to regain control of the car. The plants in the back seat shivered loudly.</p>\n<p>Just then, a roaring sound filled the air. Behind them, dozens of demons appeared out of the ground below, screaming or cheering. It was impossible to tell.</p>\n<p>A second tire popped.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to use a miracle,\u201d Crowley said, and the Bentley roared on deeper through the field.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the vents began to drip maggots- a light trickle only, for now.</p>\n<p>A voice said \u201cpull over, Crowley, or I\u2019ll fill the whole car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know you are threatening the SUPREME ARCHANGEL OF HEAVEN!\u201d Aziraphale shouted to the maggots.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want you,\u201d Hastur snarled. \u201cWe only want to bring our new friend home where they belong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel screamed.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale turned to Crowley. \u201cWe have to get out of the car. We can\u2019t fight and drive or we risk getting discorporated, and I do believe that\u2019s the last thing we want right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley knew he was right. With a grunt of fury, he threw the car into a hard spin and came to rest facing the advancing crowd of demons.</p>\n<p>They leapt from the car. Aziraphale and Crowley flanked Muriel, who held the book tightly as they trembled.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay BACK,\u201d Aziraphale yelled, and suddenly he was emitting a golden light. He stepped forward with his arms spread to protect Crowley and Muriel, and sent a blast of energy towards the horde. It was loud; loud enough to drown out the sound of the Heavenly trumpets that sang out into the evening sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a warning!\u201d Aziraphale hollered. He could see demons he recognized in the crowd, many from the attack on his shop. Others he did not recognize, and they looked far worse than those in the former category. They were frightening, but Aziraphale was not afraid.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo is this,\u201d said a voice behind them, and a burst of light brought the three to their knees.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t have done a miracle if you wanted to hide, Aziraphale,\u201d Uriel drawled.</p>\n<p>Angels, far outnumbering the demons present, filled in a half-circle around them. The disorderly pack of demons closed the circle. They were surrounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can leave,\u201d Michael said to the demons. \u201cWe\u2019ll deliver Muriel immediately after their sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing doing,\u201d Hastur replied. \u201cI found them, I\u2019m not leaving without them. Besides, it took forever to get everyone here. Woolfardisworthy, complete bollocks\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>As they argued, Aziraphale whispered, still on his knees. \u201cMuriel, now would be the right moment to believe your way into saving us.\u201d</p>\n<p>A tear fell down Muriel\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to do miracles since the tire popped. Nothing\u2019s worked. I think,\u201d they began to weep, \u201cI actually think <i>I</i> made the second tire pop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s eyes found Aziraphale\u2019s. This seemed like the end. They grabbed each other\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough arguing,\u201d snapped a voice. The Metatron stepped through the crowd directly where the demons and angels met.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the hell\u2019re you?\u201d Hastur spat.</p>\n<p>At this moment, the Metatron\u2019s walk was impeded by the presence of a demon with hair like rabbit ears.</p>\n<p>The Metatron coughed. Eric turned to face him with a smug grin. \u201cNeed something, old timer?\u201d</p>\n<p>In a blast of confetti, Eric was gone.</p>\n<p>Hastur looked down hastily and moved further away from the Metatron.</p>\n<p>\u201cAngels of Heaven,\u201d the Metatron addressed them loudly. \u201cDemons of Hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see before you three traitors; three traitors to Heaven, one of whom is so industrious that he also managed to become a traitor to Hell. The Demon Crowley has corrupted both our lowliest scrivener, Muriel, and our Supreme Archangel, Aziraphale. With only enemies left to them, they took off with my Book of Life to erase you all from existence.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowds around them gasped. Aziraphale protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must believe me, we would never!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley interjected softly. \u201cNot <i>all</i> of you, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQUIET!\u201d The Metatron bellowed. He turned to Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that you would never, Aziraphale, it\u2019s that you <i>could</i> never. You aren\u2019t powerful enough to open my Book. Not Beloved enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Metatron turned to face the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou all shall see God\u2019s power today. You will watch as these three are erased, you will see exactly why Angels and Demons do not work together. And you will not remember their names, faces, or their deeds, but you will remember this moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>From somewhere in the crowd, a demon spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t these two do, I dunno, kinda necessary things? Don\u2019t we\u2026need them becaAAAAAH!\u201d</p>\n<p>With a snap, this second Eric became confetti.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, now if you please; my Book.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Metatron, b-but I won\u2019t,\u201d Muriel choked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Muriel, but you will.\u201d The Metatron gestured softly with a single index finger.</p>\n<p>Muriel stood quickly, and very straight. Too straight. Their spine seemed to pop and crack. They let out a cry of pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome now. Enough of this foolishness\u201d the Metatron said, giving Muriel a look of hatred, and Muriel took a single, agonizing step towards him. Everyone could see this was against Muriel\u2019s will.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, no!\u201d Crowley said. At that moment, he grabbed Muriel\u2019s hand, still clutching Aziraphale\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Muriel froze. Crowley turned to his angel, eyes wide with fear behind his glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cAngel, what do we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale looked at the crowd around them, understanding fully that the three of them were, perhaps, the most hated beings to exist. The only allies they had were each other. In that final moment, Aziraphale needed to make sure Crowley knew.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Crowley, my dear Crowley,\u201d he sighed, lip trembling as he scanned the demon\u2019s face. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He held Crowley\u2019s face with his free hand and kissed him. It was desperate, like their first kiss, but the similarities ended there. Both kissed with equal passion, equal need. Crowley separated his hand from Aziraphale\u2019s and used it to hold the angel closer.</p>\n<p>The crowd surrounding them roiled with disgust and fury. The Metatron silenced them with a wave of his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cMY BOOK, MURIEL,\u201d he demanded, his voice terrifying. Not by their own accord, Aziraphale and Crowley broke apart as if pulled by two giant claws. Crowley quickly scrambled to grab Aziraphale\u2019s hand again. If Aziraphale and Muriel were going to disappear, they wouldn\u2019t be alone in their last moments. <i>He</i> wouldn\u2019t be alone in his. He looked at Muriel and Aziraphale, and wanted so badly to spare them, that suddenly, he believed he could.</p>\n<p>A massive purple dome sprung forth from the three figures at the center of the circle. It knocked down all angels and demons, and pushed one Metatron back. Wings shot forth from the trio\u2019s backs, and The Book of Life fell from Muriel\u2019s hands and landed on the ground in front of Crowley.</p>\n<p>They could stand again, so Aziraphale and Crowley rose up together. Aziraphale held Crowley\u2019s right hand, and Crowley held Muriel\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Muriel asked, gazing at the angels and demons as they slowly got back to their feet up, rubbing their heads or wings.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did a miracle,\u201d Crowley said softly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen one look like that. Did you\u2014?\u201d He turned to Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I did one too,\u201d Aziraphale whispered. \u201cI tried to\u2026to protect you both.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Crowley said breathlessly. He felt very powerful. Invincible, maybe.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe book!\u201d Muriel cried.</p>\n<p>Responding to the potent energy around it, the Book of Life swung open. Its pages flipped rapidly before them, landing finally on a page near the front. One name seemed to be highlighted with light.</p>\n<p>Muriel peered at it. \u201cEnoch,\u201d they said. \u201cSee? I told you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale and Crowley stood on either side of Muriel and began to read.</p>\n<p>\n<i><s>Enoch</s>, son of Jared. Status: Alive. Species: <s>human</s>. Year of Birth: 3384 BC. Year of Death: N/A. </i>\n</p>\n<p>Scribbled in the margin was a single word: <i>Metatron</i></p>\n<p>Crowley looked over at the Metatron and grinned. \u201cUsually people with bad first names don\u2019t change them to worse ones,<i> Enoch</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Metatron colored a deep red and stomped towards the book. \u201cGive me that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the book\u2019s pages flipped and flipped some more. Only this time, the trees surrounding the field began to sway wildly as well, and dust lifted in the wind all around them, and then, as if the universe itself was inhaling-</p>\n<p><i>She</i> was there. Winds whipped and clouds rolled rapidly, and a beam of brilliant light fell on the three of them.</p>\n<p>Her voice rang out, like that of a stadium of people, and yet still somehow only one voice. \u201cAziraphale, Crowley, please stand aside. I need a word with Muriel in private.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley gazed up at the source of the light, agog for a moment, then released Muriel\u2019s hand and tried to drag Aziraphale out of the light beam. The angel resisted, frightened for his friend- he couldn\u2019t bear to see another good angel fall.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Muriel said, trembling from head to toe but smiling at them anyway. \u201cWe-we can always t-tell you everything we talked about afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>It hadn\u2019t been very long since Aziraphale had said those words to Muriel.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d His voice was tinny.<br>\nHe followed Crowley outside of the beam of light.</p>\n<p>From outside the light beam, God\u2019s voice could be heard but not understood. The angels and demons surrounding them had fallen to their knees. After a moment, Crowley and Aziraphale did too, still grasping the other\u2019s hand. No one thought to capture them. All eyes were turned upward.</p>\n<p>Almost all eyes, rather. A few yards from them, something very strange seemed to be happening to the Metatron. He was trembling, panicking even. His were the only eyes not glued on the light above. He scanned the crowd. His eyes fell on Crowley and Aziraphale and he scrambled towards them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou blithering idiots,\u201d he hissed. \u201cYou absolute-!\u201d</p>\n<p>God spoke. \u201cNo more of that, Enoch.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Metatron crumpled, looking like he was asleep, and maybe he was. God\u2019s voice returned to the the beams, only for Muriel to hear.</p>\n<p>All Muriel could think, standing under God\u2019s light, was how they got here in the first place. How only a night before, the Metatron was scolding them in Heaven.</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cMuriel, as you should already know, demons and angels do not intermix. They do not forge friendships. They do not drink at the pub together, or feed ducks. If Archangel Aziraphale accepts this, why can\u2019t you?\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I- suppose I, I, I don\u2019t understand why? I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Muriel was nervous.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand? Even an angel as dim as you should be able to grasp this.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>From the corner of their eye, Muriel could see Michael\u2019s lips curl into a smile.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Muriel swallowed. \u201cI only mean to say, if one demon can wind up redeemed, even just a little, by befriending an angel, well\u2026shouldn\u2019t we want that for all of them?\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cWould you risk your purity, your holiness, to redeem a fallen angel?\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cI don\u2019t see why I would have to risk anything,\u201d Muriel said apologetically. Disagreements weren\u2019t easy for them. \u201cCrowley isn\u2019t with Hell. He\u2019s good, even if he\u2019s not, well, Good.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cWell, thanks to your interesting philosophy, Crowley won\u2019t be anything now,\u201d the Metatron hissed. The Book of Life fell from somewhere and onto the table in front of the Metatron.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cYour Holiness?\u201d Uriel tilted their head. Erasures were not commonly performed.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cUriel, tell the Heavenly Host that Muriel\u2026\u201d the Metatron glared at them coldly. \u201cThat Muriel has fallen.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Muriel gasped, unable to speak. They collapsed in disbelief and began to weep upon the floor.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cMichael,\u201d the Metatron spoke louder so ans to be heard over the sound of Muriel\u2019s sobs. \u201cInform Hell that they should expect a new arrival.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Michael nodded curtly, sparing Muriel a blank look, then followed Uriel away.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cSaraqael, we shall need a new angel to fill Muriel\u2019s vacant post. Find someone suitable.\u201d Muriel could hear them speed away.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Muriel didn\u2019t know why they were surprised that none of the angels objected to Muriel\u2019s sentence.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cNow,\u201d the Metatron faced Muriel. \u201cHave you anything to say for yourself?\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Muriel looked up. The Metatron looked old, so very old, and so very powerful. \u201cPlease,\u201d they said.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The Metatron sneered. \u201cYou fallen angels all say the same thing in the end. How very predictable.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Muriel thought of another fallen angel. One who told them they only needed to give themselves permission to be extraordinary.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cGo to sleep!\u201d Muriel commanded suddenly.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The Metatron looked at them. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cI said,\u201d Muriel stood, trying to look powerful too. \u201cGo to sleep!\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The Metatron laughed. \u201cMy dear, I haven\u2019t slept since I was a-\u201c</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cGO TO SLEEP, RIGHT NOW, PLEASE!\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The space between them filled with purple mist. It cleared, and the Metatron\u2019s giant head lolled forward, eyes closed.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Muriel couldn\u2019t believe it.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cAre- are you tricking me?\u201d Muriel whispered, a finger outstretched, wondering if poking the Metatron would wake him. They then wondered if touching the Metatron was even possible. Would they explode if they tried?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>They picked up the book from the table, and, ever so gently, touched his cheek with it. The book flipped open.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cWHAT the BLAZES?\u201d Michael shouted, returning with Uriel and Saraqael. Muriel turned around, tucking the book in their coat, more out of habit than intention.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Michael stood between the gateway and Muriel, hand outstretched, pointing. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Muriel may have blacked out at this point. They knew they had evaded the angels, and that it required a very lot of running. They also knew that they\u2019d set off some kind of defensive miracle that locked the gateway behind them as they leapt through it and into Aziraphale\u2019s shop. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel,\u201d God said neutrally. Muriel shook their head as if to erase the thoughts. How had it been only a day since then?</p>\n<p>God\u2019s light brightened and Muriel fell to their knees.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded. \u201cY-yes, Almighty God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShirley Temples, road trips\u2026even stealing books.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel\u2019s eyes widened with fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat gives you the right, Muriel, to face the Metatron and defy him? Well?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel sputtered, bowing their head into the dirt of the field. \u201cOh, Almighty, I-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to say you\u2019re sorry?\u201d God spoke over Muriel, silencing them. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did what you did to protect your friends. You defied the Metatron, highest of Heavenly beings, to save the soul of a demon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel couldn\u2019t tell if God was pleased.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yes, Almighty God, I- I thwarted your will.\u201d Muriel began to weep.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour friend Aziraphale said it well; The Metatron is God\u2019s voice, not God\u2019s will. As it happens, I don\u2019t have very much to say, typically.\u201d</p>\n<p>She continued. \u201cI could destroy you for this. But I won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel exhaled, tears streaming down their face. \u201cThank you, Almighty God! You are so merciful!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, alright,\u201d God said disinterestedly. \u201cYou seem like you want to ask me something. You may.\u201d</p>\n<p>There were many better questions to ask the Almighty, but Muriel couldn\u2019t think of any. \u201cHow did I do all those things I did? To the Metatron, and the archangels, I mean\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI let you,\u201d God said simply, and Muriel understood that She wasn\u2019t arrogant. She spoke of her ability with no awe, like a person describing taking a walk or making a sandwich. Controlling everything was as simple as blinking to Her.</p>\n<p>Muriel wondered if She even had physical eyes that blinked.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus,\u201d God continued, amused, \u201cEnoch really did need a nap. All that Second Coming nonsense, after I\u2019d just made it clear to both Heaven and Hell that I have no interest in ending the world right now\u2026\u201d God stopped. \u201cYou look confused.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe just a little,\u201d Muriel tried to understand. \u201cYou gave me temporary abilities, for a few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, for a few milliseconds, a few different times. You can\u2019t possibly understand, but I\u2019ll explain anyway. I am in every second for as long as I want to be. I can make every second stretch- I do it all the time. A second or a thousand years feels the same to me. I have no beginning, no end. I am not of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel tried to wrap their head around that and found it impossible to imagine experiencing, but not difficult to comprehend.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you were in each moment I attempted a miracle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2026adjusted my settings each time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not especially powerful, then?\u201d Muriel said, smiling in order to cover other feelings.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot compared to me,\u201d God replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, of course not!\u201d Muriel laughed, utterly terrified that their question was somehow disrespectful. Then it struck them that saying \u2018of course\u2019 may have been disrespectful. They shut up.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you are a very good Scrivener. Exceptional even,\u201d God said kindly. \u201cEnoch is ready to rest now, which means I need a new scribe. Someone who knows right from wrong. Someone I can trust with my Book. Someone who won\u2019t use a silly title like \u2018The Metatron\u2019. Blecch.\u201d God laughed.</p>\n<p>Muriel\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh. So go tell them goodbye. We have work to do,\u201d God said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, of course.\u201d Muriel smiled even wider than before, as though that would stop them from crying.</p>\n<p>This was an incredible, unfathomable honor- perhaps the highest honor. But, amid all of this glory, there was one thing that hurt.</p>\n<p>God, being God, knew what Muriel thought; Muriel believed God wanted them to say goodbye to the only friends they\u2019d ever had.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Muriel. You\u2019ll be able to say hello whenever you\u2019d like. He has a gateway, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAziraphale won\u2019t be coming back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d God said plainly. \u201cHe\u2019s earned a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded happily. \u201cOh! Jolly good!\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel scanned the crowd: Aziraphale and Crowley knelt on the outskirts of the light beam, among the crowd of angels and demons who had come for the book thief and instead found themselves awed by Her ineffable glory. Muriel trotted up to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, what did the Almighty say?\u201d Aziraphale was breathless.</p>\n<p>Muriel tried very hard at first not to look too pleased with themselves, but quickly gave up. \u201cEverything\u2019s okay! I\u2019m being promoted! New Metatron! Me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d Crowley cried, grasping Muriel\u2019s hands and cheering excitedly along with them. Immediately, he cleared his throat harshly and remembered himself. Aziraphale looked at Crowley fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot kidding- look!\u201d Muriel held the book in their hands, wide open. Enoch\u2019s entry had changed.</p>\n<p>\n<i><s>Enoch</s>, son of Jared. Status: Deceased. Species: <s>Human</s>. Year of Birth: 3384 BC. Year of Death: 2023. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d gasped Aziraphale. He glanced at the place where the Metatron had been. Nothing remained but a black suit jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s mine!\u201d Muriel said, flipping further into the middle of the book, having no trouble turning the pages now. \u201cMuriel, former scrivener, Voice of God the Almighty.\u201d They puffed their chest up proudly.</p>\n<p>Overcome, Crowley balled his hand into a fist and congratulatorily rapped them on the arm. There was not even a smidge of condescension in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour entries changed, too,\u201d Muriel said happily, flipping the page and indicating a line entry with their index finger. The first word was entirely blacked out. The second, <i>Crawly</i>, was struck through. Crowley\u2019s line then read:</p>\n<p>\n<i> Crowley. Status: Alive. Species: <s> Archangel </s> <s>Demon </s> ???</i>\n</p>\n<p>Muriel then flipped to another page, holding the book out to Aziraphale.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, dear, I don\u2019t want to see it.\u201d Aziraphale stepped back hastily. \u201cI know what I am. I don\u2019t want a label for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel nodded and smiled, closing the Book of Life.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurns out Enoch had gone a little, uh, bloodthirsty there. God hadn\u2019t actually wanted most of what was going on, so there\u2019ll be staffing changes, I\u2019d expect. However, this <i>does</i> mean I\u2019ve got to go up to Heaven, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>They paused. Then, with a little wail, Muriel threw their arms around Crowley first, and Aziraphale second.</p>\n<p>The angel patted their back fondly. \u201cMur- I mean, Metatron, will we still be able to-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Muriel</i> is fine, Aziraphale. I\u2019ll be busy being God\u2019s scribe,\u201c (they gave a proud, important sort of wiggle), \u201cbut you can say hello any time with the gateway. God said so Herself!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. We really need some Us Time after all this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled awkwardly, glancing down at Crowley and Aziraphale\u2019s intertwined fingers. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure you two are ready to have time, just the two of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant <i>US</i> time, Muriel. The three of us,\u201d Crowley said with a wobbly grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d It was all Muriel could do not to cry.</p>\n<p>\u201cCopious amounts of alcohol at <i>the Ritz</i> sound about right?\u201d Aziraphale suggested, wiggling an eyebrow at Crowley.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, The Goat Tavern!\u201d Muriel clapped, regaining the ability to speak. \u201cI\u2019d like to say hello to my pub friends. Might even try out <i>winking</i>,\u201d they said deviously, causing Crowley to laugh loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel,\u201d God said, and this time Her voice reached the crowd. \u201cCome along now, we have a great deal of organizational restructuring to address. You can catch up with them on Sunday. Right, Aziraphale?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stammered. \u201cSunday\u2019s schedule is completely open!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d God replied. \u201cAnd you do understand you\u2019ve been fired, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stuttered a few moments. \u201cYes, I- I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so happy, Aziraphale,\u201d God said, great affection in Her voice. He adjusted his facial expression immediately, failing to look somber.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d God\u2019s tone changed. The clouds darkened.</p>\n<p>Crowley realized his glasses had disappeared from his face and were suddenly in his left hand. He looked up at Her light, nothing separating his eyes from Her glory. Nothing to hide behind. He was frightened, but he was determined to keep his back straight.</p>\n<p>God was silent for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, you know,\u201d She said finally. \u201cTime to go, Muriel.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a happy giggle, Muriel walked towards the center of Her light. They turned to face their friends, waved excitedly, then the light was out. Muriel was gone.</p>\n<p>The crowd of angels and demons stared, open-mouthed, at the place Muriel vanished. Crowley wiped tears from his eyes and returned his glasses to his face.</p>\n<p>In a breath, Aziraphale found himself surrounded in Archangels. He held Crowley\u2019s hand tighter, who pulled him close.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell??\u201d Michael demanded furiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Uriel was only slightly calmer than their peer, but their eyes seemed to bug out of their head as they stared between Aziraphale and his boyfriend in the dark glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk the new Metatron,\u201d Crowley said proudly. \u201cJust missed them, though. Bad luck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho? You can\u2019t possibly be referring to <i>Muriel</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley and Aziraphale turned away and walked towards the Bentley, hand in hand. Michael continued shouting, threatening, and soon other angels joined in as well. The demons who didn\u2019t disappear the moment God arrived ran alongside them, demanding answers of their own.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry, but we\u2019re not taking questions at this time,\u201d Aziraphale said briskly, reaching the car. Crowley opened the door for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter you, Angel Supreme.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Former</i>, my dear,\u201d Aziraphale replied, sliding into the passenger seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Crowley said quietly into the angel\u2019s ear before closing the door for him.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Crowley was blasted by twin jets of white and red energy. Hastur was there, arm raised. A few feet to his right, Michael pointed at Crowley too.</p>\n<p>He turned to them. \u201cAh, would you look at that! Heaven and Hell, working together again! I thought you lot were trying to avoid that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Michael and Hastur glanced at each other anxiously. This dual attack was not intentional.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you still\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine?\u201d Michael finished, sounding stupid and knowing it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Almighty\u2019s Protection, I should think?\u201d Aziraphale pipped, rolling the car window down and poking his head out.</p>\n<p>The truth was, Crowley and Aziraphale had both felt a change, a shift, when their miracle took hold. Crowley had kept Aziraphale safe, and Aziraphale had the pleasure of finally rescuing Crowley in return.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t have an answer as to why the miracle was still holding; perhaps it was thanks to the new powers bestowed upon a new Metatron. Maybe it was an act of God\u2019s Grace. It didn\u2019t really matter- all they cared about was that it seemed, at least for now, that neither the Heavenly Host nor the agents of Hell could touch them. For the first time in thousands of years, they felt safe.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf God\u2019s protecting you, why\u2019re you still a demon?\u201d Uriel asked, sounding more confused than upset, like they were on the cusp of understanding something very important and yet so very simple.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s absolutely <i>perfect</i>,\u201d gushed Aziraphale, gazing adoringly up at Crowley.</p>\n<p>Crowley leaned against the car, grinning smugly as though sunning himself in the angel\u2019s praise. \u201cAlright there, Hastur? Been a long time! What\u2019ve they got you doing these days?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cM-maintenance. Investigations if they ask,\u201d he stuttered, almost against his will. He was unsure of what kind of consequences he might face by ignoring one of God\u2019s favorites. He didn\u2019t want to find out.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, enjoy that then,\u201d Crowley strode around the car. \u201cBest be off, now! Go on, you lot, back to your offices! Shoo!\u201d He urged them away like a farmer shooing crows out of his garden. Some actually listened.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you all, well, <i>never</i>, I should hope!\u201d Aziraphale added out the window, laughing in a tinkling, sparkly way.</p>\n<p>Crowley hopped into the driver\u2019s seat and they were off, the Bentley, all four tires intact, spurring up dust in their wake.</p>\n<p>Wiping said dust from their face, Michael looked desperately at the angels and demons around them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I the only one wondering what the actual fuck just happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a plume of dark purple smoke appeared, sending Michael stumbling back and into a coughing fit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWoolsery!! I\u2019m here! Made it!\u201d Shax shouted triumphantly. She looked around at the mass of angels and demons, who all looked thoroughly bemused and aimless, some of whom were returning to their respective offices.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s already started?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>A few hundred miles later, the Bentley traversed the final few Soho streets leading up to the bookshop. Its driver could\u2019ve miracled themselves there directly, but the drive was calming. Pleasant. The Bentley drove at a pace somewhere in between Crowley and Aziraphale\u2019s preferences; both were surprised to find this agreeable. It was nighttime now.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d Aziraphale said softly, studying the way the passing streetlamps tossed lights and shadows across Crowley\u2019s face. \u201cI want to go celebrate somewhere, but I must admit, I\u2019ve been so very homesick\u2026 May we stay in tonight and have breakfast tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>They pulled up in front of the shop.</p>\n<p>Crowley didn\u2019t know what this meant for him, so he left the engine running as Aziraphale stepped out. \u201cAs in- do I- should I go-?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale opened the backseat of the car and pulled out a box of plants, ignoring the question entirely. \u201cCome along, my dear, let\u2019s get your things inside. Won\u2019t these add some life to the shop!\u201d Aziraphale smiled lovingly at a ficus, whose leaves waved shyly back.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo- your-?\u201d Crowley\u2019s brain was offline. He stumbled out of the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do hurry, Crowley. I think I\u2019d like to give sleeping a try. Can you teach me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley gaped at the angel, unable to move. Aziraphale gave him a look as if to say \u201cwell?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley remembered to breathe. \u201cNo, no, I need some <i>direct</i> words for whatever\u2026this is.\u201d If Crowley had learned anything, it was that they couldn\u2019t continue hoping the other would read their mind. He had a feeling that, now that Aziraphale had returned, his diaries would be off-limits once more.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Aziraphale set the box of plants on top of the Bentley. His eyes burned with purpose. With sincerity.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to bring <i>our</i> plants into <i>our</i> shop, open a bottle of wine from <i>our</i> collection, and drink it with me in <i>our</i> bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Faster than even he knew he could move, Crowley rounded the Bentley, tearing off his sunglasses and stopping centimeters from Aziraphale\u2019s face. \u201cAnd?\u201d He whispered fiercely.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale flushed. The proximity was too much. Crowley\u2019s eyes were too much. \u201cAnd be mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was what Crowley needed to hear and what Aziraphale needed to say. They moved together, Crowley marveling at the willingness of Aziraphale\u2019s lips, the strength of his hands against Crowley\u2019s back as they pulled him in closer, closer still. Could they ever be close enough?</p>\n<p>There were no lapels for Crowley to grab, so one arm slipped around Aziraphale\u2019s torso while the other buried itself in his hair. Aziraphale\u2019s arms slid up over Crowley\u2019s shoulders and looped around his neck. They swayed together, deliriously happy. <i>This</i> was the kiss they\u2019d been waiting for.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw!!! Yay!\u201d A joyful and familiar voice from the sidewalk rang out, causing the two to break apart.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaggie! Don\u2019t interrupt them!\u201d Nina scolded in a loud whisper, pulling her girlfriend into the coffee shop. A second passed, then both women pressed their faces against the glass to get a better look.</p>\n<p>Crowley and Aziraphale took a step back from each other, but couldn\u2019t remove their hands entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps we should-?\u201d Aziraphale said, flicking his head towards the door of the shop as it opened on its own.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, we definitely should,\u201d Crowley replied hungrily. In a snap, the plants had disappeared. He grabbed his angel\u2019s hand and led him inside. Into <i>their</i> shop. Into <i>their</i> home.</p>\n<p>Early Sunday morning, Crowley awoke to soft kisses on his lips. Aziraphale was still getting the hang of sleeping. He couldn\u2019t seem to do it for more than a couple hours at a time, and didn\u2019t know that it was generally considered rude to wake someone else in the wee small hours of the morning just to kiss them.</p>\n<p>Crowley would, of course, never tell him that, and furthermore, would likely kill anyone else who tried.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good, you\u2019re up!\u201d Aziraphale punctuated the sentence with another kiss.</p>\n<p>Crowley groaned, feigning irritation, and wrapped his arms around the angel, reveling in the warmth their bodies generated under the covers.</p>\n<p>Crowley kissed Aziraphale\u2019s nose. \u201cIt\u2019s 4:17 in the morning, Angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! Technically morning,\u201d Aziraphale replied brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Technically</i>,\u201d Crowley conceded with a nod, then pressed his face against Aziraphale\u2019s. \u201cGood morning, Angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, my dear.\u201d Aziraphale, not wasting any opportunity to kiss his Crowley, brought their lips together again.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something thrilling and tragic about desperately wanting something, only to discover, once you have mustered the courage to give it a go, it\u2019s your favorite thing you\u2019ll ever do. Aziraphale and Crowley both mourned the wasted time. Six thousand years on Earth they could\u2019ve spent holding each other. It ached; there was only one cure for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold me tighter, Angel,\u201d Crowley whispered against Aziraphale\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale drew Crowley against him ever tighter. \u201cThis good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley shook his head, his hair tickling Aziraphale\u2019s cheek. \u201cNot enough. I need more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dear, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d Aziraphale said, pulling his head back to smile fondly at Crowley.</p>\n<p>Crowley returned the look with a darker one, needy and flustered. Suddenly, Aziraphale understood what Crowley meant.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn second thought,\u201d the angel growled softly. They were kissing again.</p>\n<p>~~~~</p>\n<p>They could\u2019ve stayed there all day, but by eleven, Crowley was doing his best to get a stubborn Aziraphale out of bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have things to take care of, Angel! Muriel\u2019s stopping in, remember?\u201d He sighed, admiring the angel, all pink-cheeked and cozy in the bed they shared, and found himself wishing he could live in that moment and never leave.</p>\n<p><i>This is an every day thing, Crowley. Aziraphale in a bed is a part of your life now. Stay focused, </i> urged the voice in his head. It hurt to get out of bed when Aziraphale so badly wanted to stay in it.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale opened his eyes a sliver to confirm what he hoped was happening actually was happening: Crowley, biting his lip, gazed longingly at him. The angel smirked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything I can do to\u2026tempt you to stay?\u201d He fluttered his eyelashes just so.</p>\n<p>Crowley\u2019s cheeks flushed\u2014 <i>that </i> was playing dirty. He grabbed the corner of the downy comforter, yanking it off the bed and the angel in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Angel! Rise and shine, now- you\u2019re so good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFoul fiend,\u201d Aziraphale whined, rolling over and speaking into the pillow.</p>\n<p>Crowley, watching the sad display with his arms crossed and hip jutting out, realized he had one surefire way to get Aziraphale out of bed. He raced downstairs, then returned holding one thick, leather-bound book with colorful little sticky notes poking out the side. He turned to a page and began to read aloud:</p>\n<p>\u201dEvery day, the temptation I fight grows stronger. It is a losing battle, I fear, for each time Crowley-\u201c</p>\n<p>Aziraphale sat up very quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201c-enters my shop, my knees weaken and my heart-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cIS THAT MY DIARY?\u201d Aziraphale squealed, chucking a pillow at Crowley as hard as he could. The demon dodged the pillow and the angel that followed, leaping up onto the bed and reading louder.</p>\n<p>\u201c-POUNDS MADLY! IT\u2019S PARTICULARLY TORTUROUS WHEN- ARGHH!\u201d</p>\n<p>At this moment, a second pillow hit Crowley square in the face, then the angel wrapped himself around Crowley\u2019s waist and dragged him down. Aziraphale tried to tug the book from Crowley\u2019s hands, but the demon wriggled away and fell off the bed.</p>\n<p>Crowley hopped to his feet and, laughing madly, hurried down the spiral staircase. He resumed reading at the top of his lungs:</p>\n<p>\u201c-PARTICULARLY TORTUROUS WHEN HE\u2019S WEARING THE NEW STYLE TROUSERS HE\u2019S PICKED UP- <i>oh, Angel, how naughty!</i>- THEY LEAVE SO LITTLE TO THE IMAGINATION, AND YET-!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale wailed loudly. \u201cCrowley, I promise you that I will draw out my halo and DISCORPORATE YOU!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAND YET, MY IMAGINATION HAS NOT YET RUN OUT OF NOVEL FANTASIES INVOLVING THE TROUSERS AND THE DEMON IN THEM\u2026OR OUT OF THEM, AS THE CASE SO OFTEN IS.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley finished the sentence triumphantly and looked up at Aziraphale, who was frozen halfway down the staircase and had gone very quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I hate it when he talks about your <i>outfits</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley dropped the diary with a little squeak of surprise. Just behind him sat Muriel, covering their eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Crowley,\u201d they said. \u201cHello, Aziraphale. Did you forget we were supposed to meet 6 minutes ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a snap, they miracled a robe onto Crowley\u2019s otherwise entirely bare body.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel! You need to warn us before you barge in! We\u2019re- we\u2019re-??\u201d Crowley looked at his angel for help.</p>\n<p>\u201cLovers,\u201d Aziraphale finished, uninterested in beating around the bush. Crowley blushed furiously. \u201cSo either wait for us to let you in or risk seeing a lot worse than that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, understood!\u201d Muriel nodded with a grimace, looking over at Crowley as he bent to pick up the diary he\u2019d dropped. \u201cI still don\u2019t see what\u2019s so <i>spectacular</i> about it, though,\u201d they murmured.</p>\n<p>A few minutes and one <i>cupperty</i> later, Crowley and Aziraphale were ready to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere to first, Constable?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel smiled. \u201cI think the park to start. After all, I gave those ducks my word that I\u2019d be back.\u201d Crowley chuckled, understanding they were completely serious about the promises they\u2019d made to ducks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you can try ice cream!\u201d Aziraphale clapped excitedly. \u201cYou\u2019ll love it! Even Crowley likes it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! Jolly good! And after that, the pub?\u201d Muriel looked at them hopefully, bouncing on their feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Crowley agreed. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t had the chance to celebrate your promotion, you know.\u201d<br>\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p>\n<p>A few hours passed at the park. Muriel admired ducks and sketched trees while relaying all the news out of Heaven. They talked books with Aziraphale and gossiped with Crowley, stopping only to wink at the occasional human making googly eyes at them as they walked by.</p>\n<p>At one point, Crowley sat on his preferred bench and watched as Aziraphale and Muriel cooed over waddling ducklings. Something about his angel bonding with Muriel made him feel full in a place he\u2019d never realized had been empty.</p>\n<p>Sensing Crowley\u2019s eyes, Aziraphale turned back to beam at him. Crowley was always rendered breathless when the angel looked at him that way. There was no better feeling.</p>\n<p>In the late afternoon, they walked together to<i>The Goat Tavern</i>, chatting about Muriel\u2019s new interest in television programs (\u201cThe TV in Heaven is completely demon-proof!\u201d) when Aziraphale stopped suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrowley, you must be joking!\u201d He scolded. \u201cHow could you take Muriel here?\u201d He gestured to the pub with distaste.</p>\n<p>Crowley chuckled. \u201cOh, grow up, they\u2019re harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho, exactly?\u201d Muriel asked nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dear, this is a satanic pub,\u201d Aziraphale explained, glaring at Crowley. \u201cThe owner\u2019s held rituals here in the tunnel below for, gosh, seventy, eighty years? That dreadful John George Haigh business\u2026\u201d*</p>\n<p>\u201cBut- but I asked you! I asked when we\u2026\u201d Muriel spluttered, completely aghast. \u201cCrowley, you- you ARSEHOLE!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley giggled madly, racing away as Muriel gave chase, brandishing their diary like a club.</p>\n<p>The chase concluded after Muriel landed a respectable wallop across Crowley\u2019s back. \u201cFine, Fine! We\u2019ll go somewhere else!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d still like to go in there,\u201d Muriel huffed, \u201cbut you deserved that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe most certainly did!\u201d Aziraphale agreed, linking arms with Muriel and walking haughtily past Crowley and into the pub. It was really rather nice once you forgot about the whole Satan thing.</p>\n<p>The barman lit up with a charming smile as Muriel entered. \u201cWelcome back!\u201d He said, eyes warm.</p>\n<p>Muriel winked at him. \u201cI brought friends!\u201d</p>\n<p>The barman directed his attention to Crowley and Aziraphale. \u201cHey there! First time in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley spluttered- who did this human think he was, forgetting Crowley like that? \u201cNo! I brought Muriel here in the first place!\u201d</p>\n<p>But the barman was already looking back at Muriel. \u201cPimm\u2019s Cup for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel eyes twinkled, happy to have been remembered. They smiled brightly. \u201cYes, exactly! Thank you!\u201d They added a wink for good measure.</p>\n<p>The wink helped; the barman stayed close through the night, making sure they never needed to flag him down or endure empty cups even when the pub filled around them.</p>\n<p>Once sufficiently sloshed, Aziraphale tucked himself under Crowley\u2019s arm as the demon slurred animatedly and Muriel laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn other words, you <i>can</i> drink poison, but <i>should</i> you?\u201d Crowley considered the question. \u201cActually, yes. You should do it at least once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should <i>not</i>,\u201d Aziraphale demurred. \u201cCrowley nearly lost his head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Muriel gasped. \u201cOh! I nearly forgot! I meant to give you the things you left in Heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Things I left?\u201d Aziraphale was thoroughly lost.</p>\n<p>In a soft gesture, Muriel was suddenly holding a stack of items- no one else in the pub seemed to notice. On top, folded perfectly and pressed, were the clothes Aziraphale wore to Heaven. He made a joyous little noise; how he had missed them.</p>\n<p>He placed the clothes on the bar counter, and, confused, lifted the next set of items; six manila folders.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuriel, what are-?\u201d Aziraphale stopped talking abruptly, having just opened the top file and realizing he was about to be utterly humiliated.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, what\u2019ve you got there? Heavenly secrets?\u201d Crowley flipped file two open. \u201cOh. WOW.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale ripped the folder away from Crowley, blushing deep red. His collection of Earth Observation files had grown since he first used the device. He visited it each time he missed Crowley. Which, as it were, had been very often.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does this folder say \u2018Safe Search Off?\u2019\u201d Crowley was unsure if he should be disgusted or horny.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever you mind!\u201d Aziraphale snapped. The documents vanished (reappearing deep in a closet in the shop that Crowley never used. They would be safe there).</p>\n<p>The last item was a large book.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, this isn\u2019t mine, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes! I know,\u201d Muriel laughed in a soft, somewhat uncomfortable fashion. \u201cI thought I\u2019d give it to you to keep in the shop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale examined the book, not wishing to hurt Muriel\u2019s feelings. \u201cI don\u2019t usually store modern textbooks. They update so frequently, you see- they\u2019re the only kind of book that doesn\u2019t appreciate in value.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but I actually meant to, uh,\u201d Muriel swallowed. \u201cWhat I mean to say is, that book is for you. And Crowley. I think it may help. I think it may help you both.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. He read the title again.</p>\n<p><i><u>Trauma Counseling, Second Edition: Theories and Interventions for Managing Trauma, Stress, Crisis, and Disaster</u></i> by Lisa Lopez Levers</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Oh, well. That is\u2026\u201d Aziraphale didn\u2019t know why his eyes were filling with tears. \u201cThat is very thoughtful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley reached over to pat his dear friend\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, Muriel.\u201d<br>\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Well past midnight, the three returned to the shop, stumbling and singing old drinking songs that Muriel didn\u2019t know (but they didn\u2019t let a trivial thing like that stop them).</p>\n<p>They swayed inside together, arm in arm in arm. \u201cThis has been so fun,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cI wish I could stay.\u201d They looked at the gateway, a little guiltily.</p>\n<p>\u201cSober up now?\u201d Crowley suggested. The three of them expelled the alcohol with a grimace,</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret, dear, you just pop in any time,\u201d Aziraphale smiled through the unpleasant taste in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter warning us,\u201d Crowley added hastily.</p>\n<p>Muriel grinned. \u201cHow\u2019s next week?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale\u2019s face fell and Crowley rubbed his neck. \u201cAh, dear, next weekend, we\u2019ll actually be visiting a national park. Are you familiar with South Downs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Yes, I\u2019ve read about it. Going on a long holiday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, just going to take a look at little cottage for sale. Thought it might be nice to have somewhere to run away to when we really need it.\u201d Crowley looked at Aziraphale with a shy grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut nowhere too far,\u201d Aziraphale smiled back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds lovely!\u201d Muriel walked towards the gateway. \u201cWell, when you\u2019re free next, you know where to find me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back on Monday, Constable. How\u2019s Tuesday night for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask my boss,\u201d Muriel activated the gateway, no candles required, with a soft gesture.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Her we say hello,\u201d Aziraphale said, waving. \u201cAnd that we hope She\u2019s well!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s <i>God</i>, Angel.\u201d Crowley rolled his eyes. \u201cSee you later, Inspector.\u201d</p>\n<p>Muriel stepped into the glowing rune and smiled at their friends. They made a mental note to make sure every South Downs cottage on the market was positively dreamy. With a wink, they rose in the beam of light and faded away.</p>\n<p>As Muriel faded from view, Crowley appraised his angel as he miracled himself into his beloved returned clothes. \u201cCome to bed, love?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a moment, Crowley. I\u2019m going to make a cup of tea and see if I can wear the Heaven off of these garments. Tea for you, darling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d He meandered to the stairs, preparing to rest but not wanting to go to bed without Aziraphale. \u201cI love you, Angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aziraphale smiled. \u201cI love you too, Crowley. Be up in just a moment. Stay awake for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Crowley nodded. Once upstairs, he swapped his clothes for one of Aziraphale\u2019s cotton undershirts and slid on a pair of his favorite novelty socks; black with sweet little yellow ducklings. He climbed into bed and curled up, reflecting on all the changes of the last few years. Closing his eyes, he marveled at the fact they ever made it here in the first place. It was truly the least probable outcome, but that was how it worked, wasn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>The Ineffable Plan never failed to astonish.</p>\n<p>Some time later, soft kisses roused him. \u201cYou said you\u2019d wait for me, dear,\u201d Aziraphale whined.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018<i>Mnotsleeping</i>!\u201d Crowley propped himself up on his elbow. Aziraphale slipped his arm through the space there and cuddled up close.</p>\n<p>Crowley had only barely woken up, so sleep was closing in on him fast.<br>\n\u201cI could do this forever,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>The lovely part of forever is you can start it whenever you want to. It\u2019s always waiting for you to remember it, waiting for you to be brave enough to seize it. Aziraphale felt joy beyond measure to know they had, <i>finally</i>, decided to begin their forever.</p>\n<p>Aziraphale stole a few more kisses before sighing contentedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so we will, darling,\u201d he replied, closing his eyes and drifting off to the sound of Crowley\u2019s peaceful breathing.</p>"
