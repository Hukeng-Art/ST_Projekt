I loved writing them too much not to include some. the ones featured here aren't necessarily in chronological order and they don't always directly relate to the surrounding sections, but they do inform the narrative a bit more, plus they're just cute to read!! I think I ironed out all the formatting bugs, but if you see something weird, let me know!</p>\n<p>(btw thank you Zenyr for pointing out those typos! you rock!) </p>\n<p>MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE MANGA from here on out, guys. I'm serious, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled for the next season of the anime.</p>\n<p>okay, that's enough from me. enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>i hope it was worth the wait lmao. let me know what you think!

  "text": "<p>Right after the stagehand signals five minutes, Gen feels his phone vibrate in his back pocket.</p>\n<p>Unsure who would be texting him other than his manager, who\u2019s waiting in the green room, Gen pulls it out quickly, unlocking the screen. It\u2019s from an unknown number.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Bohr says I\u2019m right.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Followed by a link.</p>\n<p>Eyebrows raised, Gen taps the link. After a second of buffering, his phone browser pulls up a page that Gen recognizes as some sort of scientific article about quantum physics. He catches sight of the terms <em>matter wave nature</em> and <em>observer effect</em> before his eyes glaze over and he switches back to the messaging app.</p>\n<p>Normally, he\u2019d just ignore the message and block the number, like he does when fans occasionally get a hold of his personal information, but something about the sheer confidence of the message intrigues him and before he can stop himself, he\u2019s tapping out a response.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">From what I can tell, this Bohr person is dead and can\u2019t weigh in on any personal arguments. One of several mistakes you\u2019ve made today ;)</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>His phone buzzes with a response before he can even put it back in his pocket.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">You know that\u2019s not what I mean, old man. The observer effect and the uncertainty principle are different, period. I\u2019m trying to help you study, so take this seriously.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Gen starts typing again. Clearly, he\u2019s been accidentally contacted by some sort of science nerd and he really needs to cut that off at the pass.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">I should have been clearer: you\u2019ve got the wrong number.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Again, the response comes quickly:</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Don\u2019t try that on me again. I\u2019m not falling for it.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In his periphery, Gen sees the stagehand signaling two minutes, but he keeps frowning down at his phone.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Don\u2019t be so pushy. No one likes an aggressive guy, you know.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Stop trying to distract me from the fact that you were wrong.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What exactly was I wrong about?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Do I really need to spell it out for you? Fine, fine. After you were so INSISTENT about Heisenberg\u2019s work, I took the liberty of tracking down these materials for you so that you don\u2019t make such an embarrassing mistake on your selection exam. No need to thank me.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen can\u2019t help but snort at the gall. Who talks like this? Other than him, that is.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsagiri-san,\u201d the stagehand whispers loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cComing, coming,\u201d Gen sings, powering his phone off and tucking it back in his pocket. Let his unaware friend talk to themselves for a while.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still smiling as he parts the curtains with aplomb to begin his act.</p>\n<p>When Gen checks his phone later, after letting himself into his empty apartment, still flushed with energy from a successful show, he\u2019s tickled to find eight missed notifications.</p>\n<p>Most of them are paragraphs of technical-sounding jargon that Gen can barely parse, interspersed with fond-sounding insults and links to increasingly esoteric articles.</p>\n<p>Flopping down on his sofa, Gen responds:</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s ~fascinating~ and all, but I was serious earlier. If you want your wayward student to pass his exam, you should try texting him instead, sensei.\n</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>This time, Gen has time to run a hand over his tired eyes and consider going to bed before the reply comes.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Hang on, you\u2019re not joking?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Nope~ double-check the number.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Another few minutes pass, during which Gen assumes his mystery texter is cross-referencing his contacts. Then--</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">I apologize for that.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen snorts.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">It\u2019s okay~ it\u2019s not every day I get mysterious, passionate texts about science.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You didn\u2019t have to let me just keep rambling.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I tried to tell you, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah, I guess you did.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Tsk tsk. You should trust people more.\n</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">To be fair, my father has tried that on me before to get out of studying.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">To his own son? How cold~</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>After hitting send, Gen realizes he just assumed his mystery texter was male and quickly amends:</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">*child</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">No, son is correct.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well, you sound like quite the taskmaster, so I guess I can\u2019t blame him. What is he studying for?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Or not studying, as the case may be.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">He\u2019s trying to get selected for a manned mission to the International Space Station.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen raises his eyebrows, stretching out on the sofa.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">And you\u2019re helping him?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">He needs the help. He\u2019s a physics professor, but if he can\u2019t even tell the difference between the observer effect and the uncertainty principle, then he\u2019ll never pass the preliminary selection.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Of course, of course.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen has almost no idea what those words mean.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">You certainly know a lot. Are you a professor too?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Fishing for information?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Are you saying you don\u2019t trust me?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"> I don\u2019t know you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I don\u2019t know you either.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Fine then. I\u2019ll tell you what I do if you tell me what you do.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen considers for a second, tapping a finger against his lips. Basic stranger danger insists he not divulge personal information to a complete stranger over text message, but there\u2019s something oddly charming about his new texting buddy. What harm can a little polite conversation do?</p>\n<p>(And it\u2019s not like he has anyone else texting him.)</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Deal. I\u2019m a performer~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">A performer of what?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sorry~ can\u2019t tell you that. I\u2019m getting fairly well-known. If I tell you what I perform, you might be able to track me down and murder me.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">That\u2019s fair. You do seem pretty irritating. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to help myself.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen cackles, rolling over on his side.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">How cruel!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It\u2019s better to be safe.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Your turn, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m a student.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>So not a sensei. The title still seems apt, somehow. Gen takes a second to change the unknown number\u2019s contact name to <em>Sensei</em> before responding:</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">What\u2019s your major?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m in high school.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s eyes widen.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">You\u2019re not!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Unfortunately, I am.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Seeeriously?? You must be very precocious for your age.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Okay, I\u2019m not twelve. Quantum mechanics and particle wave research are well within high school curriculum.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But helping someone study for a space program selection exam surely isn\u2019t.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It\u2019s really not that impressive.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">No need to be modest!! I\u2019m your fan, sensei~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Oh, great. The wrong number I texted and lectured about Niels Bohr is cheering me on.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You\u2019re definitely younger than me and I barely understood any of what you sent me earlier. Of course I\u2019m impressed~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Please, that was nothing. It\u2019s actually very easy to understand once you know the basics.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>This guy wants to explain, Gen realizes. He smiles. It\u2019s not like he had plans for the evening.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m afraid I wasn\u2019t a very good science student, sensei. Is it really that easy to understand?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Anyone can pick it up. All you have to know is the fundamentals of particle physics, and that\u2019s easy stuff. So in 1925, a physicist named Erwin Schroedinger\u2026.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen sticks one of the couch pillows under his head and settles in.</p>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t become a habit. Any sane person would laugh the whole thing off and stop talking to the guy who accidentally texted them about Niels Bohr, but Gen is nothing if not experimental. Every notification from Sensei makes him giddy. It\u2019s the same feeling he gets when he works a kink out of his act, or when a trick goes right for the first time.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fun, in a way. Gen prides himself on being able to figure out how people tick, and a stranger he only communicates with via text is a unique challenge. He can\u2019t help testing this guy, or being delighted when Sensei tests him right back.</p>\n<p>From what he can tell, Sensei responds best to genuine-seeming curiosity and understated praise. He can pick out probing questions instantly and is uninterested in flattery, but he\u2019s eager to educate and responds well to certain kinds of compliments. It doesn\u2019t take Gen long to uncover Sensei\u2019s iron-clad ego, incredibly advanced for someone his age and solid enough to rival even Gen\u2019s, but it\u2019s obvious that Sensei isn\u2019t arrogant. Confident and audacious, sure, but he\u2019s the first to admit when he doesn\u2019t know something and seems honestly intrigued by Gen\u2019s knowledge of psychology.</p>\n<p>Chatting with Sensei quickly becomes Gen\u2019s favorite distraction. Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t be so eager to text someone several years younger, but it\u2019s not like either Gen or Sensei have any desire to meet.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Frued was a hack, of course, but he was the first to act on the concept of innate desires in his practice.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen types, trying to keep his restless hands busy as he waits for his editor to arrive at their meeting spot. A publisher finally showed interest in his first book and he needs to make sure the draft is perfect before he sends it off.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">He was wrong about literally everything, though, and it\u2019s unfortunate that he\u2019s the face of modern psychology.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Oh yeah, the Oedipus complex guy.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Sensei goes through long periods of silence, but when he\u2019s in a talkative mood, he responds very quickly.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Among other things. He pioneered psychoanalysis but his theories on the unconscious are all out of line. Did you know he popularized the concept of the libido?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a psychology thing?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Of course! And it ruined the whole field of study for a long time. Almost everything he proposed has been disproven, but his work has pervaded the general public, so we\u2019ll never get rid of it. You\u2019ve heard of Id, Ego, and Super-Ego?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">In passing.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">As if the human mind can be so easily compartmentalized.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It\u2019s interesting to see you speak so scathingly about something.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">This is my wheelhouse, sensei~ it\u2019s kind of fun to know more about something than you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Psychology isn\u2019t something I need in my line of work.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Don\u2019t be so hasty. You never know when you might need to get in someone\u2019s head.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">If I ever need to do that, I\u2019ll just call you.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Blinking down at his phone, Gen almost misses his editor sliding into the booth across from him.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Sorry sensei, my editor is here. Gtg!!</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>And he puts his phone in his backpack and tries not to think about why he\u2019s blushing.</p>\n<p>When his meeting is over and he\u2019s nearly bouncing with excitement, he checks his phone again to find one new message.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Editor? Are you a writer?</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen curses internally. He\u2019d been so caught up in his thoughts he didn\u2019t even notice the slip. That\u2019s just a little more information than he intended to share. He types slowly, biting his lip:</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">In a manner of speaking.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Sensei responds quickly.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">I thought you were a performer.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I wear many hats. In this economy, it pays to diversify.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">It\u2019s nothing you\u2019d be interested in, sensei. Trust me.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The typing bubble pops up, ellipses rippling for a beat, then disappears. A moment passes before Sensei\u2019s reply comes:</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019ll take your word for it. That\u2019s pretty cool, though.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Relieved, Gen smiles.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Thank you~ but don\u2019t be too nice, sensei. I\u2019ll get used to it~</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>He almost adds a winky face but stops himself. A winky face is a big commitment. He needs to probe a little more to discover how Sensei feels about emojis before taking that step.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Noted. And I looked into that guy we were talking about earlier. Even with my limited knowledge of psychology, I can tell you\u2019re right. He is a hack.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Thank you!!</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m not saying that memetics isn\u2019t a legitimate field of study.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You\u2019re just saying it\u2019s beneath you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">No, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not as vital as other anthropological fields.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What is anthropology if not the study of memes?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Is that a joke?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Me~? Joking~?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Memetics in the modern day can\u2019t be compared to the study of things like art trends or linguistic analysis. That\u2019s just a fact.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I disagree. It\u2019s social language, sensei! Doesn\u2019t sending a specific image to someone to denote a particular emotion ultimately serve the same purpose as hieroglyphics? In the 1700s it was common for painters to paint themselves posing in window frames. How is that not a meme?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Art historians would disagree with you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Do you know any art historians?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Do you? </span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s beside the point.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Why don\u2019t you ask an art historian and get back to me.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Why don\u2019t you ask Neils Bohr.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Maybe I will.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F644\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Little gray box.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Omg, are you texting me on a brick? You need an upgrade, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It\u2019s funny--you\u2019re not the first person to tell me that today.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Someone who does as much research as you needs a high-quality smartphone.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Mine works just fine, thank you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Obviously not, if you can\u2019t see half of my adorable and super relevant emojis.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Somehow I think I\u2019ll survive.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F61B\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I can see that one.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">:P</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Leeches? Seeeeriously??</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah, some hospitals still keep them.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Ewww!!! Why?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Nobody believes they suck out bad blood or anything. They have a really specific purpose.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Ensuring that I never set foot in a hospital ever again?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah, and doctors will sometimes use them after reattaching a body part. If it\u2019s something small like a finger or toe and they act fast enough, severed pieces can be reattached without too much damage.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Oh, that\u2019s good to know.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Skilled surgeons can reconnect arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the limbs, but veins, which do the opposite, are smaller and harder to work with. So what happens is that blood flow can be reestablished to the severed part, but only in one direction, and since the limbs they\u2019re working with are usually really small, normal draining methods don\u2019t always work.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F914\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">So, to keep the limb from swelling with blood that has no way to get out, doctors will use leeches. They\u2019re small enough to only take a little blood and infection isn\u2019t a huge worry in such a sterile environment.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Does the patient just have to stick leeches on themselves periodically for the rest of their life?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Nah, the veins will grow back on their own after a while.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s pretty cool, sensei, but, no offense: <span class=\"x1F616\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll never have to see it firsthand.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Yeah, fingers crossed.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">No, Houdini didn\u2019t go to the seances because he believed in ghosts.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Then why would he go?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">To disprove the mediums!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Wasn\u2019t he a magician?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">That doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t value the truth! He worked hard on his illusions but he never claimed to have supernatural powers and he hated people who exploited the public with lies for money.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You would have liked him, sensei. He was very methodical. He\u2019d wait until he had definitive proof that the medium was faking and then he\u2019d reveal himself dramatically and out them as a fraud.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I can see why you like him.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You can\u2019t tell me you wouldn\u2019t love to flip a table and tell off a fake medium.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Fake medium...implying there are real mediums?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well~ who\u2019s to say?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Don\u2019t tell me you believe in ghosts.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Fine, I won\u2019t tell you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Oh my god.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You can\u2019t prove there aren\u2019t ghosts!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">The burden of proof is yours, man. I can\u2019t prove a negative.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Have you ever seen a ghost?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">...no</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Not yet!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Do you really believe in that stuff?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m just open to the possibility. There are a lot of crazy things in the world. You should know that better than anyone, Mr. Science Man.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Nothing exists in the world that can\u2019t be explained with science.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Maybe ghosts and things like that are just a science we haven\u2019t figured out yet.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Doubtful.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Psychology is a legitimate science, right?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">A SOFT science, but yes.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But we barely know how the human brain works right now, yet there\u2019s no denying there are extensive mental machinations governing everything we do. Just because we don\u2019t understand it, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">That\u2019s different.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">For now~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Psychology moves slowly because it\u2019s the mind trying to understand itself, but most of it is ultimately testable. Theories involving ghosts or the afterlife, by their very definition, can never be tested.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">So I guess we\u2019ll never know for sure!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"> As someone who knows so much about human psychology, I would think you\u2019d be quick to attribute supernatural phenomenon to faulty human perception and memory. Isn\u2019t that more logical?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sure, most of it is, but who am I to dismiss thousands of years of witness testimony? What are the odds they\u2019re all wrong or lying?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">High.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But can you say 100%?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You know what, yeah. 100%</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Bet.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Bet?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">If I die, I\u2019ll come back and give you some sort of proof.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">IF you die??</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">So if you stop hearing from me and then your house gets possessed, that\u2019s me~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You have no way of knowing where I live.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I assume I\u2019ll attain some sort of cosmic knowledge when my soul merges with the universe or whatever. I\u2019ll find you ;)</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">How\u2019s that for burden of proof?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I can hardly wait.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Being in the entertainment industry at his age is as much a curse as it is a blessing.</p>\n<p>Gen has the means to live on his own and support himself, he\u2019s following his ambitions much earlier than most of his peers, and he\u2019s doing what he loves every day. It\u2019s hard work, to be sure. He writes all his own material and invents his own tricks, which usually take hours of workshopping and testing just to be feasible, not to mention the additional hours spent mastering every little motion and diversion to ensure his acts go smoothly. But even with the late nights, frustrated practice sessions, and pounds of discarded material, he\u2019s proud of how far he\u2019s come.</p>\n<p>His extensive knowledge of psychology helps him navigate the adult-dominated worlds of broadcast and publishing, but sometimes it\u2019s not enough. When you get down to it, Gen is a kid, something people are eager to remind him of when he gets a little too confident.</p>\n<p>He slams his front door with a loud bang and fists his hands in his hair, clutching tight enough to make his eyes water. \u201cI\u2019m a <em>fucking mindreader</em>,\u201d he hisses to himself. \u201cWhat were they expecting?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious to him now that the host of the talk show he was invited on didn\u2019t put much stock in his abilities, so she was ill-prepared when he started reading her. But what was he supposed to do? He\u2019ll pull his punches if he\u2019s briefed beforehand, but otherwise he\u2019s going to give it his all. It\u2019s not his fault she has unresolved issues with her daughter and an unhealthy dependence on caffeine pills. But instead of handling it like a professional, she decided to mock her teenage guest live on air when he couldn\u2019t even defend himself.</p>\n<p>Gen hadn\u2019t even checked his phone afterward, too furious and dreading the reaction on social media. His book is nearly ready for print and this is the <em>opposite</em> of what he needs right now.</p>\n<p>But he has to check in with his manager, who\u2019s probably boiling with rage over the whole thing. So he pries stiff fingers out of his hair and reaches into his messenger bag, stalking into the living room.</p>\n<p>His phone lights up with several texts and a missed call from his manager and he groans, but before he can respond, he catches sight of a notification from Sensei. Right, they\u2019d been texting before Gen went onstage. He should tell Sensei he\u2019s signing off for the night.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">And that\u2019s why you actually shouldn\u2019t drink tea for a sore throat.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s super cool, sensei~! But I have to go for tonight~! :)</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>When he doesn\u2019t hear back right away, he assumes Sensei has moved on. But then, halfway through an explanatory text to his manager, his phone buzzes.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Did something happen?</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen blinks.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">What do you mean, sensei?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You went quiet for a long time and now you\u2019re saying you have to go. And you used two tildes in one text. So I was just wondering if something was wrong.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Aww, are you trying to read me? I thought you didn\u2019t like psychology.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">This has nothing to do with psychology, I just recognize your mannerisms.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Are you trying to change the subject?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Of course not~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Nothing happened, sensei. But I appreciate the concern <span class=\"x1F618\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"> I don\u2019t trust that little gray box, but if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, fine.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen makes a face at his phone. Sensei always thinks he knows everything, but when you get down to it, they\u2019re both strangers, and Sensei is younger than him. He has no reason to go blabbing about his problems to a high school kid he\u2019s never even met.</p>\n<p>After a tense text exchange and a frustrating phone call with his manager, Gen flops down on his bed, not even bothering to change. The room is dim, only illuminated by the street light spilling in through the window, casting a sickly yellow glow across the walls. Gen cups a hand over his eyes, exhaustion weighing him down.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s still humming, buzzing too much for sleep.</p>\n<p>His phone vibrates beside him.</p>\n<p>He gropes for it, uncovering his eyes and squinting at the glowing screen, wondering what else his manager wants to complain about.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Do me a favor and look outside.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen rereads the text several times, trying to parse it.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Why?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Just do it. Are you near a window?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Yes.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"> Humor me.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Sighing, Gen levers himself up and shuffles over to the window. His bed is in the corner of the room under the windowsill so he doesn\u2019t have to get up. He peers through the glass but doesn\u2019t see anything spectacular.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Okay, what am I looking for?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Can you see the sky?</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s unit is pretty high up, and he doesn\u2019t live too far into the city, so he can see a good swath of sky over the roofs of the low-lying buildings in his neighborhood.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Yes?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">What do you see?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">A lot of black. A few stars. Why?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Do you see a short row of stars with a really bright one at the end?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well, really bright is subjective in the city, but yes I can see Sirius from where I am.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">So you know what it\u2019s called.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I do horoscopes sometimes~ I can recognize the zodiac constellations and the major stars. You can\u2019t see most of them in the city, but they\u2019re up there.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Of course you do horoscopes. Why am I not surprised.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Is there a point to this, sensei? It\u2019s late and I\u2019m sleepy <span class=\"x1F62A\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m getting there.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen snorts and settles into a cross-legged position.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Sirius is the brightest star in the sky because it\u2019s the closest star to earth relative to its luminosity. It would outshine our sun over 20 times. And it\u2019s always been the brightest star, so people have been curious about it since the dawn of mankind.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen stares up at the little star speck in the sea of flat black above him. Even with the light pollution, it\u2019s visibly brighter than the other stars in Orion\u2019s belt.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Since you\u2019re into astrology, I\u2019m sure you know stories about Sirius.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Of course. Canis Major. The dog star. The Greeks called it Orion\u2019s dog. Ancient Persians associated it with Tishtrya, a rain-maker. Chinese mythology calls it the star of the celestial wolf. Native Americans had references to it in their culture as well.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah, so it\u2019s been important for a while.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Thousands of years.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Right. People have been charting its path for a long time. But in 1844, a German astronomer discovered that it had been deviating from its path since 1755. He theorized that an unseen mass was affecting the path Sirius had been on for thousands and thousands of years.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I see.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It wasn\u2019t until 1862 that researches found Sirius B, a white dwarf in Sirius\u2019s shadow. White dwarfs are dying stars with low-to-medium mass. So this massive, ancient star was being affected by the gravity of a tiny, dying star that we didn\u2019t even know about.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen props one elbow on the window sill and leans his cheek on his hand, peering up at the little twinkle of Sirius in the distance, considering Sensei\u2019s words. It\u2019s interesting, but he can\u2019t figure out why Sensei is telling him this now.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">And you\u2019re telling me all this because\u2026?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I just thought it was interesting.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">How things can change. Even our perceptions of things.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Blinking, Gen rereads the message several times. Is...is Sensei trying to encourage him? Unbidden, a smile curls the corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">I guess you\u2019re right, sensei~ you never know what\u2019s gonna come along and change your path. A tiny, dying star, or a bad day.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Or a wrong number.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>It takes a second for Sensei to respond.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Don\u2019t get sentimental on me. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I know, I know~ that would be way too sweet for someone like you.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen glances back up at the sky, still smiling softly, and can\u2019t help imagining Sensei, somewhere out there, looking up at the same little glowing dot.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">So I won\u2019t say thank you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Good. I\u2019ll talk to you later.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Goodnight, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">No.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Just a hard no? Surely there\u2019s room for debate.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Within our lifetime, A.I. will not reach the point of true autonomy, so, no, consensual sex with a robot isn\u2019t possible.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m realizing that I forgot you\u2019re a high schooler and I shouldn\u2019t be discussing sex with you in any capacity.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m not a child.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You\u2019re literally a child!! By definition!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Fine, we don\u2019t have to talk about it, but I\u2019m only interested in the scientific morality of the whole thing.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sex with robots or sex in general?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Sex with robots.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">If A.I. can\u2019t be fully autonomous, then does it matter that it\u2019s not consensual?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Omg, what\u2019s wrong with me?? Don\u2019t answer that!! This conversation is cancelled.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You sure? You seem interested.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I don\u2019t really want to get into morality with you anyway, sensei. I get the feeling you and I won\u2019t agree about the entire school of philosophy.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Why? I think philosophy is important.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">But it bores me.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">There we go.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It\u2019s all talk and speculation. There\u2019s nothing in philosophy that can be tested.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">And I know you hate that.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">The philosophers can sit in their ivory towers and talk themselves hoarse. I\u2019d prefer to be on the ground actually figuring things out.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Of course you would, sensei~ that\u2019s what makes you so charming~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I can sense your sarcasm.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Me~? Sarcastic~? Never~!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Anyway, I never said that people weren\u2019t going to have sex with robots regardless, but without complete autonomy, the entire question of consent is moot.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F62C\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">What do you MEAN you\u2019ve never seen Alien???</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Do you want me to apologize??</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Do you have a rabb.it account? Make one. Now.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m waiting for this centrifuge to finish spinning.

It was blocking all my chakras and I couldn\u2019t stand it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Oh.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">JK!! I don\u2019t really believe in that stuff.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Ghosts are a maybe but Chinese spirituality is a definite no?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">For me at least. I\u2019m just waiting for a phone call and needed to do something. I\u2019m regretting it now though. I\u2019m tired and sweaty but everything\u2019s in the way so I have to finish :(</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Do you live alone?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m a working professional, sensei~! I pay alllll my own bills~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">How old are you?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Nosy!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Sorry, I just didn\u2019t think you were that much older than me.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m not, but I\u2019m not in high school.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">College?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I went right into the workforce. In a manner of speaking.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"> I see.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Are you planning to go to college?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah. I\u2019ve already got scholarship offers.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Seeeeriously?? That\u2019s great!! Where do you want to go?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Nosy.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sorry~! I got excited.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Why didn\u2019t you go to college? You\u2019re perfectly intelligent.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Wow, high praise from the boy genius himself <span class=\"x1F644\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span> but the truth is I already knew what I wanted to do with my life. I can do my own research and my brand of entertainment requires more hands-on experience than I\u2019d be able to get in a classroom. I didn\u2019t see any point in delaying my start for several years just to pay money to learn things I can learn on my own.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">That makes sense. And you\u2019ve clearly had some success.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You could say that~ what do you want to make of yourself, sensei?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m going to space.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F632\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">As soon as possible. I\u2019m really only planning to go to college for networking purposes. Getting on a manned space mission requires knowing the right people.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Oh, I know alllll about networking~ you\u2019ll have to do something about that abrasiveness of yours, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">What abrasiveness?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Not everyone likes a know-it-all.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">What about you?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well, clearly I don\u2019t mind, since I\u2019ve been texting you for a year now.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Oh, it has been a year, hasn\u2019t it?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sorry, I don\u2019t remember the exact day :(</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">February 3rd.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Wow.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I have good numerical recall.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Clearly. I\u2019m touched you bothered to file our anniversary in your enormous brain.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Don\u2019t be. It\u2019s not every day I misread my dad\u2019s new number and text a complete stranger about Niels Bohr.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m grateful.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">For what?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">For Bohr-chan of course! He advanced the study of quantum physics significantly!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Right. Thanks, Bohr.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Thank you, Bohr-chan~!</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen catches segments of the shuttle launch broadcast on his phone during breaks from rehearsal. He has a big show coming up, so he can\u2019t afford to take a day off, but he\u2019s determined to watch because he\u2019s positive Sensei will want to talk about it later.</p>\n<p>The commentators talk about a lot of stuff Gen doesn\u2019t really understand, but he gets the gist of it, and he manages to catch the take-off livestream. He texts Sensei right afterward.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019ll be you someday!</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Accompanied by a screenshot from the launch. But then he has to return to rehearsal, so he powers his phone off and slides his gloves on.</p>\n<p>A few hours later, on the train home, Gen checks his phone and is surprised to see no response from Sensei. He shrugs it off. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re in constant contact, after all. Sensei has his own life.</p>\n<p>So he doesn\u2019t think about it that evening, or the next morning when his phone is still quiet. By the end of that day, however, Gen can\u2019t help feeling a little concerned. He would have sworn Sensei would be all over the shuttle launch, and he certainly isn\u2019t shy about texting Gen when he\u2019s excited about random scientific minutiae. So why the radio silence now?</p>\n<p>He decides he\u2019ll give it another day. He\u2019s pretty busy himself, after all: preparing for his show, writing his next book, fielding interview requests, etc. After his first book took off, his career really accelerated, but he doesn\u2019t have time to rest. The entertainment industry is always moving and he can\u2019t afford to be left behind.</p>\n<p>So he puts his phone away and opens his laptop to respond to some emails.</p>\n<p>Another day turns into two, into three, four--then a week has gone by with no word from Sensei. Gen tries not to feel hurt. It\u2019s not like this is the longest they\u2019ve gone without speaking to each other, but he\u2019d been <em>so</em> sure Sensei would want to gush about the shuttle, and he\u2019d been looking forward to sharing that excitement with him for reasons he doesn\u2019t really want to examine.</p>\n<p><em>Sensei is a student</em>, Gen rationalizes, sitting on his bed, knees to his chest, staring at his dark phone on the duvet in front of him.<em> He probably just got busy with school</em>. </p>\n<p>The sun is mostly gone, nothing but a thin haze of orange on the horizon, but his room is lit by strands of string lights crisscrossing the walls haphazardly, a decision he made when he rearranged his apartment a while back. He kept the bed by the window, though, and every time he looks outside at night, he finds Sirius in the sky, recalling Sesnsei\u2019s dry explanation so many weeks ago. It\u2019s comforting in a way he can\u2019t explain.</p>\n<p>Now, he glances out the window, at the darkness overtaking the sky, and a thought occurs to him.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Sensei, can you see the ISS in the sky?</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>He vaguely recalls hearing something about the ISS looking like a star from earth but he can\u2019t remember the details. Could something so comparatively small really be visible from the surface?</p>\n<p>After a whole week of nothing, Gen isn\u2019t really expecting a response, so when his phone vibrates a minute later, he jumps.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Yes, but not for very long.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What do you mean?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Due to the way it\u2019s orbiting earth, when it is visible, it looks like it\u2019s moving very fast. It moves from horizon to horizon very quickly, so there\u2019s not much to look at.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Seeeriously? Can you see it from Japan?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Not tonight, and probably not from the city. In the suburbs, maybe</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Not tonight? Did you look it up?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I know the schedule.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen can\u2019t quite put his finger on it, but something seems off about Sensei tonight. Usually, he\u2019d be chomping at the bit to explain the ISS\u2019s orbit in excruciating detail, but he\u2019s being shorter than usual. It\u2019s hard to get a read on someone who\u2019s not physically in front of him, but Gen\u2019s been talking to Sensei long enough that he\u2019s pretty sure he can tell when something\u2019s up.</p>\n<p>That being said, what can he even do about it? It\u2019s not his business, not really. But when he factors in Sensei\u2019s week-long absence, he just can\u2019t shake the concern.</p>\n<p>Fuck it, he thinks.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Is something wrong, sensei?</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>He tosses the phone to the other side of the bed and glares out the window. This is stupid. He shouldn\u2019t feel this nervous. Sensei didn\u2019t hesitate prying into his personal life that one time, did he? They\u2019re friends, in a weird way, and don\u2019t friends ask about each other?</p>\n<p>All rationalizations aside, he grits his teeth when his phone buzzes a minute later.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">No. Sorry I disappeared for a week.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Nothing, predictably. Sensei isn\u2019t the type to be open with his feelings, Gen knows that much for sure. But something is obviously bothering him. Should Gen push it or let it go?</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Yeah I was really lonely <span class=\"x1F622\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I thought you\u2019d want to talk about the shuttle launch. I made sure to\nwatch it just for you~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I caught bits of it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Pretty cool, huh~?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Of course.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>God, this is like pulling teeth. Gen pushes his hair behind his ear and tries again.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Didn\u2019t you say your father was studying to go to space? How is that going?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Pretty well.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s great!! Maybe you two will be able to go together!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Maybe.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen pouts. If Sensei really doesn\u2019t want to talk, he could just not respond. But then, since he\u2019s still responding, as stilted as the conversation is, that probably means he does want to talk to someone but he doesn\u2019t feel like getting into his personal problems. With that in mind, Gen starts typing.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">You know, there\u2019s a lot of interesting psychology associated with space travel.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I bet.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">It\u2019s hard to study, since the sample size of people who have actually been to space is so small, but it\u2019s important to understand the effects space travel has on the human brain.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Not just isolation studies either! We already know that isolation is dangerous for humans, but even when groups are in space together, problems can occur.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Infighting?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sometimes, but what happens more often is that people start closing themselves off. It\u2019s literally called psychological closing, and it can happen in several ways. After a while, groups on orbit will sometimes communicate less with mission control. They\u2019ll basically close ranks on their group and develop a very exclusive attachment to each other, shutting out those that they don\u2019t perceive as sharing their experiences. It\u2019s usually just a response to group stress and works itself out after a while.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I see.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But psychological closing can happen to individuals too. Astronauts can sometimes self-isolate and stop communicating effectively. It\u2019s easy to understand why. I can\u2019t imagine a more stressful job <span class=\"x1F630\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Once you\u2019re up there, one member of your group autonomizing can be a big problem, so there are measures in place to encourage team unity! Astronaut teams are encouraged to celebrate birthdays and holidays together and make calls to mission control as a group, as well as contact loved ones as much as possible.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Are you trying to tell me something?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Oh, I could never presume to tell YOU anything, sensei~! I just thought it was interesting. The fact that humans need to be social is so well-established that they have rules to make sure it happens in space~ how cool is that~?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It just seems inconvenient.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Even so, you can\u2019t get around it. NASA agrees with me. You can\u2019t go to space if you\u2019re anti-social. The personality tests will flag you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I guess that makes sense.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">So you might want to rethink your ambitions, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Excuse me?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Someone who cuts off communication when stressed and evades questions about their well-being doesn\u2019t seem like a good match for spaceflight in my humble opinion.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Sensei\u2019s text bubble pops up and disappears a few times. Gen watches it, chewing his bottom lip.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Good thing no one asked your opinion, then.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Anyway, you\u2019re being a hypocrite.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Oh, I\u2019m so sowwy about that, sensei! I\u2019ll do better next time~!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You know, you\u2019re really annoying sometimes.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">We have that in common.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">For the record, I am not anti-social.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Have you spoken to your irl friends about your problem?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">There\u2019s no problem.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Okay, sensei~ I believe you~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But just in case you ever do have a problem, I promise I\u2019ll only judge you a little bit.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">There\u2019s no problem.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">But.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I suppose I was in need of a bit of a distraction.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well, I\u2019m nothing if not distracting. It\u2019s kind of my specialty.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">So, I guess I should say thanks.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">For what~?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">For Niels Bohr, of course.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Right! Thanks, Bohr-chan!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Thanks.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen huffs out a laugh and turns his gaze back to the window. The stars are finally starting to blink awake in the night sky and Gen tilts his head, imagining a little streak of light rocketing across the horizon somewhere on earth.</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Omg, I\u2019m so tired!!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">What are you doing up this late?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What are YOU doing up this late??</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Working.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Good little students should be in bed~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m not interested in being a good student and you didn\u2019t answer the question.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">If you must know, I was working too.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Right, your mysterious job you don\u2019t want me to know about.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Exactly~ though I kind of wish I could tell you, because I have a LOT to complain about.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You manage to complain just fine while being secretive.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Noooo, you have no idea how lucky you are. I could be complaining way more.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I guess there are things I wish I could be more specific about.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019ll listen to anything you want to say, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">So you can put it in your notes and use it to try and read my mind later? No thank you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">How mean!! I don\u2019t need notes to read your mind.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">That just makes me want to tell you even less.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F622\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Are you really up working?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019ve got some chemicals heating and I misjudged the time and can\u2019t leave.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Aww. How much longer will it take?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It\u2019s hard to say. An hour?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Seeeeriously??? To heat up some chemicals??</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">They\u2019re volatile. I can\u2019t rush it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Want me to stay up with you?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You don\u2019t have to do that.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">It\u2019s fine~ do you have your laptop? We could watch something.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I do.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m serious. You said you were tired so you should go to bed.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But I\u2019d rather stay up with you, sensei~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Why?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What do you mean why? I like talking to you. Why do you think we\u2019ve been texting for over a year?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Or could it be <span class=\"x1F622\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span> you don\u2019t like talking to me??</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">No</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I mean, no, I like talking to you</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Good~! <span class=\"x1F338\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What do you want to watch?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Whatever you want.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Gen doesn\u2019t give the future of their arrangement much thought. Whatever happens will happen, he figures. He kind of wants to meet Sensei some day, but he\u2019s not in a rush, and he can\u2019t imagine Sensei is too invested in meeting the stranger he texted accidentally and just kept talking to for some reason. What they\u2019ve got works for them, and that\u2019s all that matters.</p>\n<p>Maybe they\u2019ll meet up someday, maybe they\u2019ll gradually lose contact, or maybe they\u2019ll keep texting each other forever. Regardless, they\u2019ve got time to work it out. </p>\n<p>They\u2019ve got time.</p>\n<p>They were fighting. Arguing about something stupid. A science fiction movie that just hit theaters. Gen accused Sensei of being pedantic and Sensei responded that Gen just had poor taste. A variation on an argument they\u2019d had dozens of times before. Gen just rolled his eyes, shoved his phone in his pocket, and charged onstage, ignoring the text notification that buzzed right as he started his act. Let Sensei talk to himself for a while.</p>\n<p>He should have checked.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all he can think as the world goes black and cold around him.</p>\n<p>He should have checked his phone.</p>\n<p>After the initial drama dies down and he\u2019s already been conned into physical labor in the pursuit of electricity, he realizes that something about Senku seems very...familiar.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have much time to ponder the situation, especially when he\u2019s too busy being murdered, but even then, lying on the floor of a hut and making absurd promises with a madman, Senku\u2019s confidence strikes a chord somewhere inside him. He almost asks, as Senku helps him quietly slip his robe back on.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Have we met before?</em>\n</p>\n<p>But they\u2019re short on time, and besides\u2014Gen would definitely remember meeting someone as unique as Ishigami Senku.</p>\n<p>He knows that Taiju and Yuzuriha are plants, of course; that much was obvious to him from the moment he first met them, soon after he was de-petrified, even before he knew anything about their supposedly dead friend. Nothing on them, though. They were doing an admirable job of playing the grieving-but-accepting converts to Tsukasa\u2019s empire. Gen is simply uniquely suited to picking up on that sort of thing. As a result, he has to be careful how he interacts with them after he returns from the village. Spending too much time with them would tip his hand, but avoiding them would be equally suspicious.</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha, at least, seems to understand what Gen\u2019s presence means. Most of the empire knows he was sent to check on Senku\u2019s status, and as one of the only other people who knows Senku is alive, Yuzuriha must realize that Gen\u2019s report means he\u2019s switched sides. Taiju seems oblivious to the whole thing, which is probably for the best.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s not with Tsukasa, Gen often finds himself helping Yuzuriha with whatever she\u2019s doing, usually sewing. After a childhood spent making his own costumes, Gen isn\u2019t completely useless with a needle and thread, which is more than can be said about most of the people in Tsukasa\u2019s empire.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s during one of these sessions that Yuzuriha asks: \u201cIs there someone you\u2019d like to find, Asagiri-san?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not exactly a taboo topic of conversation, even if everyone knows Tsukasa\u2019s policy on depetrification, and people will sometimes speculate about the whereabouts of loved ones, or even appeal to Tsukasa if they think they know someone who would be a good fit for the Empire. Gen himself hasn\u2019t given it too much thought. His family wasn\u2019t exactly in the picture 3700 years ago. His manager can just wait as far as he\u2019s concerned. And as for friends\u2014</p>\n<p>He really only had one.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he chirps in response, eyes on the felling stitch between his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve always been fine on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I see. That\u2019s a good thing, I guess.\u201d Yuzuriha\u2019s tone dips and Gen looks up to find her smiling sadly, gaze distant. \u201cI worry about my parents a lot. It can be distracting.\u201d</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be easy for her, Gen realizes. On top of everything that\u2019s happening, she\u2019s still grieving the loss of almost all the people she ever knew. Taiju was an orphan, and most of the people in the empire are fine with Tsukasa\u2019s philosophy, so she doesn\u2019t really have anyone to relate to. In an effort to encourage camaraderie with one of his few allies, Gen finds himself saying: \u201cWell, there is one person.\u201d</p>\n<p>She perks up curiously. \u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA friend. Well, I suppose I would call him a friend.\u201d Gen smiles wryly. \u201cI never actually met him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she wonders, scooting forward slightly.</p>\n<p>Gen feels himself flush inexplicably. He\u2019s never actually discussed Sensei with anyone. How would he have even explained it? <em>One day, this guy texted me by mistake and I texted him back and we just never stopped?</em> Talk about pathetic. Not to mention, it was kind of...private. Sensei was like this secret refuge from the rest of the world and Gen didn\u2019t want to ruin that. Now, though, there was no reason to be precious about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny, actually,\u201d he hums after a moment. \u201cWe only met because he texted the wrong number. Isn\u2019t that strange?\u201d he chuckles. \u201cAnyone else would have just blocked the number and forgotten about it, but, well, things happened and\u2014\u201d he shrugs. \u201cTruly, a friendship for the modern era. But I never even found out where he lived, so finding him would be...impossible.\u201d Gen\u2019s smile freezes on his face, the truth of that statement sinking in for the first time. Given the nature of their relationship and how the world has changed, the probability that he\u2019ll ever talk to Sensei again is...incredibly low.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Yuzuriha is frowning. \u201cHe texted you by mistake? And then you kept texting? For how long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2014uh\u2014\u201d Gen composes himself. \u201cA little over a year, if I remember correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes widen.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that silly?\u201d Gen continues, laughing intentionally. \u201cEven thinking about that kind of thing seems so crazy now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsagiri-san,\u201d she says seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re...a performer, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinks at the sudden shift in tone. \u201cAmong other things.\u201d He returns her intense stare. \u201cI thought you knew of me before the incident, Yuzuriha-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I did, too,\u201d she mutters. \u201cI think I still do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsagiri-san,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen-kun!\u201d A familiar, sickly sweet voice cuts her off and they both jump, turning to see Hyouga striding toward them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyouga-chan!\u201d Gen greets, passing his work to Yuzuriha wordlessly and rising, dusting himself off. Yuzuriha nods politely and returns to her sewing. \u201cHow can this humble metalist help you today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTsukasa-kun wants to speak with us.\u201d Hyouga\u2019s shrewd eyes rake him up and down and Gen represses a shudder of unease.</p>\n<p>Tucking his hands into his sleeves, Gen smiles and pushes all thoughts of Sensei out of his head. \u201cLead the way, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">Sounds like a lot of hassle</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah, troubleshooting has been a real bitch.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Do you have people who can help you?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">A couple. They\u2019re eager, but not really as technically-minded as I am.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Wow, so polite from the guy who calls people idiots at the slightest infraction.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">One of them is definitely an idiot, but he\u2019s useful in his own way.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What about your father? Isn\u2019t he a professor?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Not really the hands-on type, and even his understanding of the theories I\u2019m working with is shaky. Hence why he needs to STUDY</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well, I\u2019d be no help at all. Unless you like card tricks!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Eh.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s all I can offer, sensei <span class=\"x1F622\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m sure I\u2019d figure out something for you to do. You don\u2019t seem completely unintelligent.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">When it comes to that kind of thing, I\u2019m totally hopeless.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I can teach you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s sweet or calculating.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Science can always use extra hands. Sometimes literally.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F613\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m amazed anyone hangs out with you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Childhood friends are obligated.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">How unexpectedly wholesome~!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You better not be profiling me based on this information.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Me~? I would never!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But I never read you as a total loner anyway, sensei. You\u2019re far too well-adjusted.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">List the qualities that make you think I\u2019m well-adjusted so I can eliminate them.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I can\u2019t give up all my secrets, sensei~!</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Things happen very quickly after the assault on Ishigami Village.</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s ruse is up, which is fine by him, all things considered. Tsukasa\u2019s empire was a stressful place to be, and he wasn\u2019t much use as a spy with no way to pass information. He feels a flicker of concern for Taiju and Yuzuriha, but he trusts that Tsukasa won\u2019t do anything to them. It isn\u2019t his way.</p>\n<p>Being with Senku is way more interesting, anyway. The kid\u2019s intellect is dizzying. If Gen wasn\u2019t already convinced of his lunacy by the carving he left outside of the Cave of Miracles, or his momentous victory in bringing electricity to the dark world, Senku\u2019s cell phone declaration would have sealed it. As impossible as it sounds, however, Gen can\u2019t help but believe it. If anyone can reinvent cell phones in the stone world, it\u2019s Ishigami Senku.</p>\n<p>Gen almost laughs wondering what Sensei would have to say about the whole situation. He\u2019d probably agree with Senku: <em>if you just follow the steps, you\u2019ll definitely get there</em>. He was always very utilitarian like that.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a drawback to joining the kingdom of science, it\u2019s that it\u2019s harder not to think about Sensei when he\u2019s around Senku. On bad days, the way Senku talks, his intense and confident tone, echoes Sensei so much that it sits like a physical ache in Gen\u2019s chest. On good days, the similarities are almost comforting, a touch of the familiar in a vast sea of the unknown. Dwelling on the matter is pointless, of course, but he can\u2019t help it.</p>\n<p>Senku\u2019s excitement in the face of a challenge, his encyclopedic knowledge of science and natural processes, his eagerness to educate everyone around him, his smirking sarcasm\u2014 it\u2019s all so <em>familiar</em>. Sometimes Gen can hardly stand it, but he can\u2019t stay away.</p>\n<p>What makes it even harder is that Senku seems just as interested in <em>him</em>. They\u2019re all very busy, and Senku isn\u2019t overt or anything, but Gen wasn\u2019t a semi-famous psychic for nothing, and he can tell when Senku is intrigued by something.</p>\n<p>For as much as Senku rolls his eyes at Gen\u2019s abilities, he always seems to be around when Gen is doing tricks for the village kids (and Ginrou), watching with sharp eyes and a wry smile. He refuses when Gen offers to teach him some sleight-of-hand but pays close attention when Gen demonstrates anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in liking magic tricks, Senku-chan,\u201d Gen says at one point, dropping the handful of nuts he just conjured into Senku\u2019s palm. \u201cThey may even come in handy someday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed,\u201d Senku replies, pulling a tool from his waist pouch and using it to crack the hard hull of one of the nuts. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not that I particularly like magic tricks or anything.\u201d He offers the shelled nut to Gen. \u201cWatching you just kind of reminds me of someone, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ears perking up, Gen accepts the nut and rolls it between his fingers. \u201c<em>Someone</em>? I never expected the great chief of the kingdom of science to consort with <em>magicians</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI consort with you, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a mentalist with magic powers, Senku-chan. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d Gen pops the nut in his mouth and smiles as he chews.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, my mistake.\u201d Senku busies his hands cracking the rest of the nuts.</p>\n<p>Gen watches him carefully. \u201cDid you know this person well?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku shrugs. \u201cPretty well, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku glances up, a crooked smile making his eyes glitter. \u201cNosy.\u201d</p>\n<p>A shock zips up Gen\u2019s spine. \u201cSorry,\u201d he sings, betraying nothing. \u201cYou just make me <em>so</em> curious, Senku-chan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be curious about.\u201d Senku discards the empty shells and offers the rest of the nuts to Gen, who barely has time to hold his hands out to accept them.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, if I could stop, I would,\u201d Gen laughs, juggling his new handful of nuts.</p>\n<p>Senku smiles and opens his mouth like he\u2019s about to say something, but Chrome shouting from the lab distracts them both and the matter is dropped.</p>\n<p>Christmas comes, bringing the first major test of the components for their cell phone, and as Gen blinks in awe at the illuminated tree, Senku steps up beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy take the time?\u201d Gen wonders.</p>\n<p>He feels more than sees Senku shrug. \u201cNothing wrong with a little celebration. It pays to keep morale up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen smiles, watching Suika and the other kids run around excitedly, tugging the adults into their games, bathed in the light. \u201cOf course, all in service to your vision.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all stuck with each other, more or less,\u201d Senku says. \u201cSort of like castaways surviving together. Or astronauts. And even astronauts celebrated holidays together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen blinks, a shiver of recognition flashing through him. He tucks his arms closer to his body, trying not to think of a time, thousands of years ago, that he made that exact point to someone in need of perspective.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold?\u201d Senku asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, a little,\u201d Gen hitches his smile back up.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo wonder. It\u2019s snowing, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen casts a look at the little white specks drifting gently to the ground around them. \u201cIt actually feels like Christmas,\u201d he chuckles.</p>\n<p>Senku grins at him before Suika drags him away.</p>\n<p>Senku\u2019s birthday gift is no small feat, if Gen does say so himself. With both of the most scientific minds in the village away, it falls on him to do all the planning and technical work. He\u2019s not a complete moron, but engineering isn\u2019t exactly his wheelhouse. Regardless, with everyone\u2019s help, they manage to get it done in time, and surprising Senku brings with it a rush so strong it makes Gen giddy enough to spill some of his true feelings.</p>\n<p>He plays it off, thankfully, and Senku takes it in stride.</p>\n<p>Once everyone else has retired, Gen hangs around, watching Senku fiddle with the telescope.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d he asks, tucking his hands into his sleeves against the chill coming in through the open roof. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a lot of time to test it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku glances at him, smirking. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty shoddy, but I\u2019m actually impressed. It really magnifies. Where\u2019d you learn telescope mechanics?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself an expert or anything, but I did once suffer through a very long lecture on the fundamentals of telescopics. The mirrors and lenses and all that.\u201d Gen smiles at the contraption, remembering how irritated Sensei used to get when he called it <em>the Hubble Kaleidoscope</em> on purpose. \u201cI just wrote down everything I remembered and Kaseki-chan did the heavy lifting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku hums, peering through the eyepiece. \u201cWell, it works. Mostly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHigh praise coming from you.\u201d Gen steps up beside him, gazing up at the sky through the roof hatch. The stars are so much brighter now, in a world without artificial light, but he can still easily pick out Sirius, glowing the brightest of all of them. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say the positions of the stars have shifted?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of them. Some are too far for the Earth\u2019s tilt to mean much, but the skies definitely look different now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell now, that\u2019s a little melancholy, isn\u2019t it? Kind of like the universe is saying things will never be the same again. \u201d</p>\n<p>Senku straightens up, hands on his hips, and considers the sky alongside Gen. \u201cDon\u2019t get too depressed, mentalist. Everything changes all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, I know,\u201d Gen laughs quietly. \u201cSirius B comes along and messes everything up. Nothing is constant. You don\u2019t need to comfort me, Senku-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beside him, Senku goes very still. Gen slides him a sideways look and finds that his expression has gone rigid. Even in the cold glow of the stars, Gen can see how tight his jaw is.</p>\n<p>After a beat, Senku seems to shake it off. \u201cSo you\u2019re an astronomer too,\u201d he says, not looking at Gen. \u201cPegged you as more the astrology type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever gave you that impression?\u201d Gen giggles. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. Everything I know about astronomy was forced on me by a friend of mine. The same one who lectured me about telescopes, actually. I wonder if I could still do horoscopes with the new stars.\u201d He frowns thoughtfully at the ceiling of light above them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could probably figure it out. Or make something up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to give it a try, Senku-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat kind of thing is a waste of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, of course, of course.\u201d Gen lowers his head, smiling at the floor. Senku is just...so much like Sensei. His heart gives a pang of longing and suddenly he can\u2019t be in Senku\u2019s gravity well anymore. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you to it. Happy birthday, Senku-chan.\u201d He turns to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cGen\u2014\u201d Senku breaks off but Gen pauses his steps, looking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I just\u2014\u201d Senku scratches the back of his neck, brows furrowed and looking as uncertain as Gen has ever seen him. Backlit by the night sky, Senku\u2019s eyes gleam like stars themselves. \u201cI wanted to say thanks. I don\u2019t think I said it before. So thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen tilts his head. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor\u2014\u201d Senku blinks, startled. He lowers his gaze, a small smile curling his lips. If Gen didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d say Senku looked sad. His lips move, like he\u2019s mumbling to himself, but no sound escapes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSenku-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku glances up, expression back to his neutral smirk. \u201cDon\u2019t fish for compliments, mentalist. I\u2019m not saying it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Gen chuckles. \u201cGoodnight, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Already turning away, Senku waves a dismissive hand. \u201c\u2018Night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen casts him one last searching look before descending the ladder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019ve been sitting in this tech meeting for so long my legs have fallen asleep and I\u2019m about to follow. PLEASE distract me.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Did you know that the numbness of your limbs \u201cfalling asleep\u201d isn\u2019t due to lack of blood flow but actually pinched or compressed nerves?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">...no I didn\u2019t know that. I always thought it was blood.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">If you lose circulation to a limb, it will start decomposing.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Yikes!!! Just like that?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">The decomposition process starts as soon as the cells lose access to oxygen, which is delivered by the blood. So yeah, if you actually lost blood flow to your legs, they would rot off.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Thanks, I\u2019m awake now.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Thankfully, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening when a limb falls asleep.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">So what about tourniquets and stuff? First responders use those all the time.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Tourniquets should only be used as a last resort. EMTs and doctors only use them if they\u2019re willing to sacrifice the limb. Once circulation is gone, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to reestablish it. Sometimes, that\u2019s the only option, though.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You\u2019re seeeriously blowing my mind, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Want to know the truth about vitamins?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Truth? What truth?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sensei?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sensei, I take vitamins! Don\u2019t do this to me!!!</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Working closely with Senku on their deception plan is an experience.</p>\n<p>They spend several long hours alone together ironing out the details and even longer while Senku teaches Gen morse code. In the days leading up to Gen\u2019s departure with the cell phone team, Senku drills him almost constantly, tapping messages onto his arm for him to decipher while they work.</p>\n<p>Despite the distraction of having Senku constantly nearby and <em>touching him</em>, Gen picks the language up quickly.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Senku\u2019s rotten luck, several things go terribly wrong during the whole operation, but Senku\u2019s equally strong grasp on his own fate drags them back from the brink of disaster.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you should let me do your horoscope after all,\u201d Gen whines, slumping over the table after they finally hang up with Nikki. \u201cI bet it\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku smiles grimly. \u201cMaybe someday. Where are Magma and Chrome?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen buries his face in his hands. \u201cWe were cornered by Ukyo. I had to leave them to make it back in time. I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re okay.\u201d He bites his lip, still hiding his expression. He trusts that Ukyo won\u2019t kill them, but if they get captured\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright\u2014\u201d hands on his shoulders pull him upright and start guiding him toward the ladder. \u201cBed time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Startled, Gen drops his hands, unable to resist. \u201cAh\u2014Senku-chan, it\u2019s okay! We have to prepare, and I have to keep practicing for the next call\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have <em>you</em> been up?\u201d Gen counters, knowing full well that Senku has barely rested since they split ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been running through the woods for hours,\u201d Senku shoots back. His grip is firm, his tone unyielding.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t deflect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuika!\u201d Senku yells and the familiar melon rolls into view in the clearing below. \u201cMake sure Gen goes to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it!\u201d she chirps, already racing over to scramble up the ladder.</p>\n<p>Gen shoots Senku a glare. \u201cSneaky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Senku shrugs. \u201cI learned from the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen lets Suika herd him away, heart pounding.</p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Science knows no rest, and, after Chrome is confirmed captured, they have to move quickly. Between shifting the entire village closer to Tsukasa\u2019s stronghold and using the cell phone to trick members of the Kingdom of Might, Gen barely has time to think. Despite the seemingly insurmountable odds, however, Gen never feels the fear he expects. He\u2019s scared, of course; he\u2019s seen Tsukasa and Hyouga\u2019s power up close, but Senku does everything with a certainty that overwrites even bad luck, and it\u2019s hard to feel hopeless when you trust someone so much.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s trust that crams Gen into their paper tank alongside Senku, facing the full brunt of the Kingdom of Might head-on. It\u2019s trust that drives him into the Cave of Miracles beside Senku when everything goes wrong. It\u2019s trust that lets Senku take over the negotiations.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s trust that keeps him from panicking when Senku and Tsukasa go into the river. Senku wouldn\u2019t die from something like that.</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t. Gen trusts that he wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little while before he actually sees Senku again. Tsukasa\u2019s injury needs immediate attention and Senku isn\u2019t exactly unscathed. Plus there are a million things to do in the aftermath of the battle, but Gen eventually makes it to the cave where Tsukasa is being treated.</p>\n<p>Senku is fiddling with something when he gets there, Tsukasa sleeping more-or-less peacefully in front of him. He\u2019s drooping wearily, but at the sight of Gen, he stands.</p>\n<p>Gen doesn\u2019t have the energy to fake snide disinterest as he meets Senku in the middle of the cave. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asks, gripping Senku by the shoulders and eyeing him over. He looks scuffed and battered, one hand wrapped in bloody bandages, but it seems as though Kohaku\u2019s report was correct and Senku wasn\u2019t seriously injured.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Senku grabs Gen\u2019s wrists but doesn\u2019t try to remove his hands. \u201cHyouga\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be the liar, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku blows out a sound that\u2019s almost like a laugh. \u201cYou saved my life, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>That brings Gen up short. He meets Senku\u2019s gaze with furrowed brows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTook a page out of your book.\u201d Senku gestures to his abdomen. \u201cI wrapped a sheet of batteries around my vitals. A spear-proof vest and stun gun all in one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen stares at him. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d he collects himself. \u201cThen all that awful work was worth it, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go stealing any more of my tricks. I\u2019ll lose my niche.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Senku chuckles roughly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the near-death experiences to you from now on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that\u2014\u201d Gen grips Senku a little tighter, the corner of his mouth twitching up. \u201cWith your luck, I\u2019ll be a ghost by noon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you hang around, that\u2019s no problem. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re good for physical labor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo cruel!\u201d Gen releases one of Senku\u2019s shoulders to pinch his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely getting haunted for that.\u201d Deja-vu prickles at the back of his mind but he ignores it. This is Senku in front of him right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, mentalist,\u201d Senku smirks.</p>\n<p>Gen blinks, realizing his expression had indeed crumbled and his eyes are wet. \u201cPlease, who would cry over you!\u201d But his smile is wobbly. The hand on Senku\u2019s face softens until it\u2019s cupping his cheek.</p>\n<p>Senku\u2019s sharp smile hardens into an intent line, his eyes blazing.</p>\n<p>\u201cForget about this\u2014\u201d Gen mutters before wrapping his arms around Senku\u2019s neck and pulling him in. It\u2019s not how Senku does things, he knows. This kind of overt display isn\u2019t familiar for either of them, but after everything, Gen just needs something <em>solid</em>, just for a minute.</p>\n<p>After a suspended second of rigid stillness, Senku seems to relax, just a bit, and Gen feels Senku\u2019s hands settle firmly on his back. Senku exhales, the air brushing Gen\u2019s ear. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Gen tightens his grip, ducking to press his face into Senku\u2019s collar. \u201cNot crying,\u201d he insists, voice muffled.</p>\n<p>Hugging Senku is strange. It\u2019s obvious that neither of them are really used to it, but when Senku presses his cheek against the side of Gen\u2019s head and curls his fingers into the back of Gen\u2019s robe, Gen thinks he wouldn\u2019t mind staying in this weird, awkward circle of warmth forever.</p>\n<p>Of course, they can\u2019t. Behind Senku, Tsukasa stirs, and the sound startles them away from each other. Shaking off the lingering emotional haze of the moment, Gen hurries past Senku, deeper into the cave.</p>\n<p>\u201cTsukasa-chan! I was so worried!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen\u2014\u201d Tsukasa croaks. \u201cI am glad to see you again, despite the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you always know just what to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>And his little breakdown is forgotten in the face of everything they have to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">How do you make two people realize their feelings for each other?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">owo what\u2019s this? Is Sensei experiencing the adolescent flutterings of ~love~?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Gross. Not me. Just two people I know.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Do you know them well?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">You could say that.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">And you know they like each other?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">It\u2019s painfully obvious.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">To everyone but them, apparently</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">And they\u2019re your age, correct?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yes.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Hmmmmm</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Well, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing to be done, sensei!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I thought you\u2019d have some sort of psychological trick I can use to make them get it over with.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sorry, sensei, but this kind of thing can\u2019t be rushed.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I could coach you on ways to manipulate them, but you like both of these people, right?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Unfortunately.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">So any trickery could backfire on your relationship with them. People like that have to work these things out for themselves. If it\u2019s really affecting their lives, however, you should try to speak honestly about it with them.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m not sure what to say. That\u2019s shockingly reasonable coming from you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Hey, I know real psychology and neuroscience! It\u2019s not all cunning and manipulation all the time!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I can see that now.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sensei is so mean!!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I guess I just think they\u2019d be happier if they got on with it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">They probably would be, but they wouldn\u2019t appreciate you meddling. Unless one of them comes to you for help, or you\u2019re worried about them, you should stay out of it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You seem like the type who needs to be in control, so that will probably be hard for you, but give it a try.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Alright, enough profiling me. I didn\u2019t come here for that.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Am I wrong~?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">This whole ordeal is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">What, love?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Love, relationships, feelings in general.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I\u2019m not surprised that someone as driven as you would think that way.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I don\u2019t have the patience for distractions like that.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s fine, sensei! Nobody is going to make you fall in love.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">From what I can tell, if it happens, it certainly won\u2019t be up to me.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Ah, yes, and you\u2019d hate that.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Since you need to be in control.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m warning you.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F61A\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">And I\u2019m warning that little gray box.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You\u2019re young, sensei. There\u2019s no need to rush on this stuff. If you don\u2019t wanna bother with it now, you don\u2019t have to. No one\u2019s pressuring you, are they?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">As if I\u2019d put up with something like that.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">High school is dangerous! You can never be too careful.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah, you seem like the type that was bullied in high school.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You come to me for advice and this is how you treat me?? So cruel!!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">And I\u2019ll have you know I was NOT bullied in high school.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Right.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Which of us is supposed to be the psychology expert?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I\u2019m really not sure anymore</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Merging with the Kingdom of Might goes smoother than anyone expected, probably due to Tsukasa and Senku\u2019s obvious regard for each other. If Tsukasa trusts him, the rest of the empire is inclined to as well, even after Tsukasa is frozen, but Gen keeps an ear out for potential conflict.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, nothing arises that a little smooth-talking can\u2019t fix, and keeping Yo and Magma pitted against each other effectively distracts them from potentially sowing discord among the others.</p>\n<p>Once plans for the Perseus are underway, Gen doesn\u2019t see Senku as much. It\u2019s to be expected, he figures. Senku is the brains behind the huge operation, after all, plus he\u2019s reconnected with his old friends and doesn\u2019t need to lean on Gen as a fellow modern man as much. Perfectly understandable. Gen tries not to think too hard about it.</p>\n<p>After a grueling day of digging the shipyard, Gen deposits Suika back at her hut and heads for the cave Senku has taken over for his drafting, a new stack of paper piled in his arms. As he approaches, the familiar sound of Taiju\u2019s excited voice greets him and he pauses just outside the entrance, unable to resist the temptation to eavesdrop.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014know we\u2019re busy, but things are way calmer now, so I think\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when do you <em>think</em>?\u201d Senku cuts in, and Gen\u2019s ears perk up at his uncharacteristic harshness. Senku is biting and sarcastic, but Gen rarely sees him actually lose his temper. Now, though, he sounds truly irritated.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014we should try to find them,\u201d Taiju continues, unperturbed. \u201cI mean, it couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen hears the sharp scratching of pencil on paper but no response.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Taiju tries after a second. \u201cCome on. I <em>know</em> you miss them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what? Everyone here is missing someone. What makes me so special?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSenku\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd where would I even start?\u201d Senku barrels forward. \u201cThey could be anywhere in Japan. Or\u2014there are Japanese speakers all over the world, they could be <em>anywhere</em>\u2014you think I should waste time on a wild goose chase?\u201d He huffs. \u201cAnd that\u2019s ignoring the fact that I have no idea what they look like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaiju, stop\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a mind-reader like Gen, but I know you miss them. You have to! You were so close\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d Senku sounds like he\u2019s speaking through his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely, you\u2019ve got some way to find them. Some detail or <em>something</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone else is looking for statues they know, so why\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaiju, there\u2019s nothing!\u201d Gen jumps at the sudden vehemence in Senku\u2019s voice. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve tried to figure it out? Don\u2019t you think if there was some chance of finding them, I\u2019d have done it already? I\u2019ve been over and over it and there\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just giving up?\u201d As always, Taiju matches Senku beat-for-beat. \u201cYou\u2019re probably the only person in the world who <em>could</em> find them with nothing and you\u2019re not even going to try?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just cool with never seeing them again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them at all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSenku, you always said you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just turn those feelings off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I have any other options? Even after we re-establish society, the odds of us finding each other are virtually nothing! I can\u2019t afford to sit around and\u2014and <em>pine</em> like an idiot when there\u2019s nothing to be done!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen stares at the ground, eyes wide. He\u2019s never heard Senku this worked up, a painful mixture of anger and despondency that almost hurts to listen to. And the revelation that Senku had someone so important in his life that he now has no chance of seeing again\u2014</p>\n<p>It strikes a familiar chord of sorrow that Gen thought he had buried completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrop it,\u201d Senku is saying, accompanied by the rustling of paper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about this again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taiju growls and heavy steps sound on the stone. Gen has a brief second to arrange himself before Taiju is striding out of the cave, nearly bumping into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Taiju-chan!\u201d Gen says, acting like he just walked up. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taiju just nods and maneuvers around him, stomping off down the path. Gen watches him go before ducking into the cave. \u201cWhat put a bee in his bonnet?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Senku is hunched over his makeshift drafting table, body language closed, eyes down. \u201cNo idea,\u201d he says mildly.</p>\n<p>Gen hums. \u201cI brought more paper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. Just put it anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Settling the stack on a shelf, Gen glances over his shoulder at Senku\u2019s tense figure. \u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku doesn\u2019t react, reaching for a tool that looks like a handmade compass. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know\u2014\u201d Gen wanders closer, folding his hands together, \u201c\u2014I would just hate to see the stone world\u2019s cutest couple break up over something silly. If you and Taiju-chan are having problems, I\u2019m always willing to lend an ear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think we\u2019re having problems?\u201d Senku asks, not looking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaiju-chan seemed <em>so</em> upset a minute ago, and you\u2019re the only one in here. I don\u2019t need to be a scientific genius to put two and two together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour math needs work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Kingdom of Science will surely crumble if two of our pillars are at odds! I\u2019m only trying to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen\u2014\u201d Senku finally looks up, fixing Gen with a hard stare. \u201cLet it go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen regards him. Senku\u2019s expression is firm. \u201cAlright,\u201d he relents. \u201cIt\u2019s your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a beat of intense eye-contact, Senku returns to his sketching, and the rough scratching of the pencil fills the silence between them. For a brief, insane second, Gen considers blurting out the truth, that he cares about someone he has no chance of meeting again, but that would just tell Senku that he was eavesdropping, and, besides, what would be the point? Commiseration? As if Senku has ever been interested in that. The last thing Gen wants is for Senku to think he pities him.</p>\n<p>So Gen shoves the urge aside and sweeps out of the cave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"breply\">That\u2019s it! I\u2019m quitting show business!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Good for you. It\u2019s about time.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sensei, do you know how to kill someone and make it look like an accident?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Are you seriously asking?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Yes.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Oh boy. Strap in.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Injecting air directly into the blood will cause an embolism and is virtually undetectable in an autopsy. Staging a carbon monoxide leak is easy and looks like an accident. Potassium chloride is deadly and mimics a heart attack. Gradual lead poisoning is risky if you get caught part-way through, but it\u2019s worked before. Aconite is only detectable through extremely in-depth analysis and you only have to use a little for it to be fatal.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Of course, people fall and die all the time, so if you see a chance, take it.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Thanks, sensei. I\u2019ll have to block you and delete this chat now.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\"> Finally, I\u2019ll be free.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">What made you decide to quit show business/commit murder?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">A man three times my age called me \u201csweetheart\u201d and tried to touch my hair today </span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Oh. Ew.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">He\u2019s lucky I\u2019m so nice!! I almost cursed him on the spot, but then everyone would know it was me.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Right.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">If you know his email, I could send him a virus or something.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Aw, that\u2019s so sweet, sensei~</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"> But he\u2019s a bit of a big name in the industry. You could trace him back to me. And that would ruin this fun mystery we\u2019ve got between us.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Plus this kind of thing happens all the time, unfortunately.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Let me know if you change your mind.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">You\u2019ll always be the first person I turn to if I need to break the law.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Nothing illegal about sending an email.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F914\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Senku seems to feel contrite about his argument with Taiju, and, a few days later, Gen catches him allowing Taiju to subject him to a massive hug, complete with manly sobbing and tearful gibberish, as always. It\u2019s a heartwarming sight that Gen makes sure to mock Senku for mercilessly at the first available opportunity. Senku just smiles and snipes back and Gen is relieved that things seem back to normal.</p>\n<p>His relief turns to confusion when Senku tosses him what appears to be a thick paper envelope.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suspicious, Gen peels open the sachet and peers inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not poison, mentalist,\u201d Senku groans. \u201cJust get on with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it comes to you, one can never be too careful, Senku-chan.\u201d But Gen complies and tips the envelope over his hand. A thick stack of small papers lands in his palm, bound with twine, and Gen\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cA deck of cards?\u201d he asks in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Senku shrugs. \u201cFigured a lying gambler like you would need some at some point.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nearly vibrating with excitement, Gen unties the cards and spreads them out, taking a quick mental count. It\u2019s a full deck of 52 cards, plus 2 Jokers, made of some sort of stiffened paper, and complete with scientific terminology and little drawings on the face cards. He laughs when he notices the Jokers both sporting his petrification scars. \u201cDid you draw these?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Senku crosses his arms. \u201cIs there something wrong with that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Gen sings. \u201cI always forget how <em>very</em> talented you are, Senku-chan. A true renaissance man!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Senku rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gen says earnestly. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku turns away, back toward whatever project he\u2019s working on, and if Gen didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d say the tips of Senku\u2019s ears look red.</p>\n<p>Ryusui is a surprise. Ryusui reintroducing capitalism is less of a surprise, honestly, given what Gen surmised about the man upon first meeting him, but it\u2019s no problem for Gen. After a few initial hurdles, he figures out how to make Ryusui dance to the preferred beat and all is well.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a little less adept at managing how affectionate Ryusui is compared to everyone else. It\u2019s obvious that Ryusui is a lover of many things, an aspect that makes him easy to control, and that affection quickly spreads to his new comrades. Even Senku isn\u2019t immune, unable to dodge all of Ryusui\u2019s manly back slaps and excited hugs.</p>\n<p>Gen is no exception, though he\u2019s better at staying an arm\u2019s length away, trained from years around grabby entertainers and show business personalities. He can\u2019t always escape, though, and he frequently finds himself with a muscular arm around his shoulders or unceremoniously hoisted off his feet if Ryusui deems it more efficient for whatever they\u2019re doing.</p>\n<p>He endures it gamely, unable to deny that Ryusui has a magnetism that rivals even Senku\u2019s in its ability to make people like him. Unfortunately, he has to draw a line when Ryusui absently reaches over to ruffle his hair while they\u2019re all sorting a huge stack of newly made bolts, weeding out ones with too many imperfections.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d Gen ducks quickly away, still smiling. \u201cSorry, Ryusui-chan, but if you touch my hair, I <em>will</em> have to curse you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Ryusui says astutely. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>A metallic clatter draws Gen\u2019s attention to Senku, who has apparently tipped his basket of rejects over onto the table. \u201cEverything alright, Senku-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Senku says shortly, righting his basket and scooping the little metal pieces back into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, Senku,\u201d Suika pipes up. \u201cGen can\u2019t <em>really </em>curse people!\u201d She aims her helmet at Gen, who can picture the wide, glistening eyes behind her thick lenses. \u201cRight?\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles disarmingly at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Suika-chan. I\u2019d never put a curse on <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d Senku insists, as though the very idea is preposterous. He glances at Gen, and Gen recognizes the calculating glint in his eyes. \u201cGen, did you go to college?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen blinks. Senku rarely requests personal information, and he never makes smalltalk. \u201cOh? Trying to dig up dirt on your favorite mentalist? I\u2019m not sure if I should be flattered or frightened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be anything,\u201d Senku scowls. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d And he returns to his sorting, brows pinched.</p>\n<p>Gen eyes him curiously. It\u2019s not like Senku to get down. He regards that kind of wallowing as unproductive and refuses to engage in it, no matter how tired or disheartened he may be.</p>\n<p>But then Ryusui is grandstanding about something loudly right next to him and the moment is over.</p>\n<p>Gen trusts Senku\u2019s abilities absolutely, but the prospect of sending him, Chrome, and Ryusui up in a handmade hot air balloon admittedly makes him a little nervous. He mentally recites Senku\u2019s simplistic explanation of how the contraption works, along with what he remembers from Sensei\u2019s little lectures on aviation and safe cruising altitudes but he just can\u2019t talk himself out of his nerves.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s standing to the side as they prepare for take-off, arms tucked close, watching, when his ruminations are interrupted by a now-familiar arm around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look like that, Gen,\u201d Ryusui says jovially, as though he didn\u2019t just nearly send Gen off his feet with his enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook like what, Ryusui-chan?\u201d Gen asks, smiling up at him.</p>\n<p>Ryusui gestures vaguely to his own face. \u201cLike that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be seeing things. Perhaps you should stay down here after all\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking, you know,\u201d Ryusui interrupts, pointing surreptitiously at Senku, who seems absorbed in some complicated ropework on the basket.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re nervous, he\u2019ll be nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen nearly scoffs at that. \u201cThat\u2019s preposterous, Ryusui-chan. You clearly don\u2019t know Senku-chan very well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ryusui shrugs, the motion jarring with one of his arms still wrapped around Gen. \u201cSmile anyway. Who doesn\u2019t want to be sent off with a smile?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always smiling, Ryusui-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen fake it a little better.\u201d And with a pat, Ryusui releases him, charging toward the hot air balloon.</p>\n<p>Gen watches him go with narrowed eyes.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t tell Senku to be careful, or wish him luck, because he would just say something pithy in response, but when Senku approaches him inexplicably right before lift-off, he heeds Ryusui\u2019s words and pastes on a wide smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAviation is a ladder, right?\u201d Gen says, echoing something Sensei once told him. \u201cI know it\u2019s still far off, but this is a step toward space.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku blinks dumbly at him for a second before his face cracks with a crooked grin and he shakes his head. \u201cNo need for inspirational speeches, mentalist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, isn\u2019t that why you keep me around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the only reason.\u201d He scratches the back of his head and gestures at the balloon slowly inflating behind him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext?\u201d Gen frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you up there with me sooner or later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen gapes at him. \u201cTh\u2014that is a threat! I\u2019m perfectly comfortable here on the <em>ground</em> where I\u2019m not in danger of plummeting to my death at any moment, thank you very much!\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku chuckles. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSenku!\u201d Chrome calls, waving wildly from the basket, Rysusui lounging artfully beside him. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p>\n<p>Before he realizes he\u2019s doing it, Gen\u2019s hand shoots out and wraps around Senku\u2019s wrist. They both look down at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d face warming, Gen tries to pull away, but Senku catches him, clasping their hands together. He looks just as surprised as Gen when Gen meets his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis\u2014\u201d Senku starts, stops, swallows, tries again. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s grip tightens compulsively. \u201cYes. See you soon.\u201d He hitches his smile back up. \u201cOne small step for man, and all that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Senku smiles and starts to step away.</p>\n<p>For a single, burning second, with now-ancient news stories of ballooning accidents and the long tragic history of the whole exploit running through his mind, Gen is consumed by the almost irrepressible urge to yank Senku back, grab him by that ridiculous hair and lean forward\u2014</p>\n<p>Then Senku slides his hand out of Gen\u2019s and Gen watches him walk toward the basket, breathless from the full-body insanity he just fought off.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still staring long after the balloon has risen into the sunrise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">HI!!!!

You text me often enough that they\u2019ve noticed, so naturally they\u2019re curious about this mystery person you\u2019re talking to. You have to admit, our acquaintance is a little...unusual. If it was MY friend, I\u2019d want to make sure everything was above board too.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">I don\u2019t need to be monitored. They\u2019re just being nosy.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Aw, you don\u2019t really think that. You\u2019re lucky to have such caring friends.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Jealous?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sooooo jealous!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">Yeah. You should be.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Tell your thieving friend I said hi!!!</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"text\">He says hi back.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\"><span class=\"x1F60A\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span> <span class=\"x1F338\"><span class=\"hide\"></span></span></span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The night after the balloon takes off, a few minutes after Senku\u2019s check-in call from Ishigami Village (complete with an excited recount of their dangerous mid-air mishap), Yuzuriha sidles up to him, looking more nervous than usual.</p>\n<p>\u201cGen-san, can I talk to you?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>He scans her covertly as he smiles. \u201cOf course, Yuzuriha-chan. Whatever can I help you with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really\u2014I don\u2019t need\u2014can you follow me?\u201d she gets through the question haltingly, but she gets through it, and Gen surmises that her anxiety is secondary to her determination to have whatever conversation she\u2019s trying to get out of him.</p>\n<p>He gestures with one of his sleeves. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>She takes him to the hut where her massive loom sits, currently still and silent, and flicks a few lights on, indicating for him to take a seat on a pile of furs in one corner. He does and watches curiously as she settles herself beside him, fidgeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he opens with.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, everything\u2019s fine!\u201d she says quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem very tense, Yuzuriha-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am\u2014I am, but\u2014\u201d she takes a deep breath. \u201cI should have talked to you sooner, but\u2014\u201d she twists her fingers in her lap. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so busy, and, to be honest, I\u2014I was worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen cocks his head. \u201cThis sounds very serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt kind of is. It really, kind of is, but I thought I was just imagining things and I had mostly decided to just leave it alone, but then Taiju told me about his fight with Senku and I\u2014I\u2014\u201d she presses her hands flat against her thighs and levels Gen with an intense look. \u201cGen-san, a long time ago, you told me about someone you knew, before the event, that you only talked to through text, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen stares at her, his stomach curling unpleasantly. \u201cYes, I do remember mentioning that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you tell me more?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods. \u201cAs much as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen shifts his weight. \u201cWhy do you want to know, Yuzuriha-chan? It\u2019s really not a very interesting story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen-san\u2014\u201d her eyes are shining in the lamplight. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an absurd request. Why would Yuzuriha care? Curiosity? Collecting blackmail material? As soon as the thought crosses his mind, Gen dismisses it. Whatever agenda Yuzuriha is working from, her intentions are pure. Anyone can see that. It\u2019s in the earnest rigidness of her spine, the way she\u2019s leaning forward slightly, the trembling of her lips.</p>\n<p>Gen sighs. \u201cVery well. How could I refuse the request of such a cute girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>And he tells her everything. The very first mistaken text, the strange non-relationship they developed, the gradual graduation to actual friends, the reluctant admissions of care, that last stupid, <em>stupid</em> argument\u2014everything.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost cathartic, in a way. Gen knows all about the mental benefits of therapy and counseling, the need humans have to <em>talk</em> about things, but he\u2019s never been in a position to test any of that for himself. Now, spilling all of his memories of Sensei to Yuzuriha, he feels a little pressure leave his shoulders with every word. He\u2019s tried so hard not to think about Sensei at all since the world ended, but now it all comes flooding back.</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha listens in rapt silence, each story pulling her body language tauter like a bowstring just waiting to loose a single, devastating arrow.</p>\n<p>When he catches himself choking up with frustration while recounting their last exchange, Gen clears his throat, folding his hands in his lap. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the long and short of it,\u201d he finishes, smiling blithely at his captivated audience. \u201cNothing too crazy, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha looks as though a sharp tap would shatter her all over the floor. \u201cThis\u2014this Sensei person\u2014you cared about him?\u201d she asks tremulously.</p>\n<p>Gen taps his chin. \u201cYes, I suppose. As much as you can care for someone in that situation, anyway. Why are you so interested in this, Yuzuriha-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen-san, please be honest with me\u2014\u201d she leans forward so intently that Gen nearly startles backward. \u201cDo you miss him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014what is the point\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s heart stutters in his chest. \u201cYes,\u201d he confesses, holding her searing gaze. \u201cHe was my closest friend. I miss him all the time.\u201d This time, the smile that curls his lips is thin and wry. \u201cPathetic, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shakes her head, clasping her hands in front of her. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not! It\u2019s not! It\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful?\u201d Gen repeats. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t see how\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen-san!\u201d She\u2019s positively beaming now. \u201cI know who Sensei is!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen blinks. \u201cI\u2019m...sorry? How is that possible?\u201d But he can\u2019t help the little bubble of hope that swells inside him.</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha laughs delightedly. \u201cI could hardly believe it myself! The probability\u2014it\u2019s fate! It must be fate!\u201d She bounces back on her heels. \u201cOh, he\u2019s going to be so <em>happy</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuzuriha-chan, please, put me out of my misery,\u201d Gen pleads, watching her with mounting trepidation. \u201cWho is it? Do you know where he is? Can we find him?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shakes her head, grinning. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to find him! Gen-san\u2014Sensei is Senku!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s breath freezes in his lungs. \u201cWhat?\u201d he rasps.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s still jittering with glee. \u201cThis is so exciting! It\u2019s kind of weird\u2014you always seemed a little familiar to me, but I thought it was because I saw you on TV, and when you told me about your friend, I always wondered\u2014but I thought that was too much of a coincidence! But still!\u201d She beams at him. \u201cHere you are! It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s nice to finally meet you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen wants to protest, to explain that it\u2019s simply not <em>possible</em> for Senku to be Sensei, but the words won\u2019t come out. Because the puzzle pieces are assembling in an irrevocable cascade, one into another into another\u2014Sensei\u2019s father studying to go into space, Sensei\u2019s two childhood friends with feelings for each other, Sensei\u2019s obsessive pursuit of knowledge, Senku\u2019s cryptic argument with Taiju\u2014until Gen is faced with the whole picture.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unbelievable. But it\u2019s undeniable. Sensei is Senku.</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha is still babbling excitedly but Gen can only stare at her, brain whirring as it tries to process this new reality.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d he starts after a second, and she breaks off instantly, leaning forward. \u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d he asks quietly.</p>\n<p>She tilts her head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Her eyebrows pinch together. \u201cAre you okay? You look a little lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen laughs humorlessly. \u201cI...I am lost. What am I supposed to do? What does this mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen-san\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can still barely believe it\u2014that kind of coincidence\u2014is it even possible?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d she insists.</p>\n<p>Gen squeezes his eyes shut for a second, and when he opens them again, he\u2019s smiling. \u201cSorry, Yuzuriha-chan. I forgot myself for a minute there. I\u2019m just so shocked!\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowns. \u201cGen-san\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for telling me! What a crazy story, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen-san, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Yuzuriha-chan!\u201d Gen rises smoothly. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve had a long day. You should get some sleep. I\u2019ll leave you alone\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>She scrambles up beside him, catching his sleeve. \u201cGen-san\u2014\u201d her eyes are wide and glistening. \u201cAre\u2014are you going to tell him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it comes up, I might mention\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe really cared about you,\u201d she interrupts, curling her fingers tighter into his sleeve. \u201c<em>So</em> much. He talked about you all the time. And he misses you, I <em>know</em> he does. He\u2019d be out there looking for you if, well, if it was possible\u2014and even then, I know he wants to find you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen keeps his gaze fixed carefully over her shoulder. \u201cHe wants to find his silly wrong number friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>you</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her face crumples. \u201cGen-san\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to think about this, Yuzuriha-chan,\u201d Gen says honestly. \u201cThank you for telling me. I have been worried about what became of Sensei, and I\u2019m relieved to know he\u2019s okay. But I\u2026I need to think.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a tense second, Yuzuriha nods and releases him, clasping her hands against her chest. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be friends with you for so long, Gen-san,\u201d she whispers. \u201cSince before I even met you in Tsukasa\u2019s camp. I\u2019ll keep quiet to Senku if you want me to. And if you ever want to talk\u2014\u201d she offers him a watery smile. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gen forces out. Then he all but flees from the hut, his heart in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">Can you cook?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">ExCUSE me?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">The audacity.

With Senku, Chrome, and Ryusui away, a lot of leadership duties fall to him, so it\u2019s not like Gen has time to dwell, especially once the farming effort starts in earnest.</p>\n<p>And yet, dwell he does.</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha, true to her word, keeps the whole thing to herself but can\u2019t seem to resist shooting him baleful glances at least a few times a day. Gen just smiles and acts natural, but in private, he <em>dwells</em>.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t pin down how he feels about the whole thing, cycling through stages of frustration, anger, confusion, and mortification. Now that he\u2019s on the other side of it, he realizes he <em>should</em> have known. All the signs were there, and hadn\u2019t he felt instinctively that Senku was familiar to him? If only he\u2019d trusted his gut and actually paid attention, he wouldn\u2019t be boiling with humiliation and inexplicable dread.</p>\n<p>And Senku! Does he know? His argument with Taiju suggests he didn\u2019t at first, but what about now? That probing question a few weeks ago\u2014did he figure it out then? Gen knows he\u2019s parroted things Sensei told him\u2014would Senku remember well enough to pick up on that? Would he even care? Yuzuriha and Taiju both seem to think Senku misses his texting buddy, but does he? <em>Really?</em> What if he knows and he just doesn\u2019t care? Maybe their quote-unquote relationship pre-petrification was only important to Gen\u2014but no, that\u2019s just destructive thinking. Senku had to like him at least a little, right? He wouldn\u2019t have kept texting him otherwise. So Senku, straightforward, no-nonsense Senku, probably doesn\u2019t know, but does that mean Gen should tell him? What would be the point? But Senku did seem worried when Gen overheard him in the cave\u2014</p>\n<p>Questions and memories and justifications run around and around, arguing with each other and spinning Gen\u2019s brain in circles as he lays awake at night, staring at the ceiling. But there\u2019s no conclusion, no aha moment. All of Gen\u2019s mentalist powers combined can\u2019t conjure anything more substantial than a string of vehement curse words that plays like a record every time he thinks about the whole thing.</p>\n<p>And before he can get any further than that, Ryusui needs them to find his mysterious butler, who then takes off into the wilderness, basically forcing Gen to follow them all the way back to Ishigami Village because what else is he going to do? Let this strange tiny person wander the forest alone minutes after awakening from complete petrification? Gen might not want to see Senku right now but he\u2019s not that cruel. (Plus he really can\u2019t take Yuzuriha\u2019s well-meaning smiles anymore.)</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen a while,\u201d are Senku\u2019s first words when Gen limps up to the group surrounding the makeshift oven while Francois, seemingly unperturbed by the long walk, inspects their sorry attempt at bread.</p>\n<p>Gen flashes him an exhausted smile. \u201cWe talked on the phone the day before yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku crosses his arms. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s right; now that Gen is back in Senku\u2019s atmosphere, after the longest time they\u2019ve spent apart in over a year, he feels like a moon settling back into orbit. He\u2019d been so preoccupied with his own thoughts he failed to realize how much he missed the pressure of Senku\u2019s gravity constantly at his side. A warmth where he didn\u2019t even know he was cold. There\u2019s really nothing like it.</p>\n<p>So Gen straightens up and grins. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t have too much fun without me, Senku-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, map-making, <em>so</em> fun.\u201d Senku grins back and then they\u2019re just standing there, grinning at each other like idiots.</p>\n<p>Until Gen clears his throat. \u201cAnyway. Bread?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Bread.\u201d</p>\n<p>Francois quickly proves to be the best possible addition to the kingdom. They\u2019re competent, efficient, intelligent, and nice to Suika, so Gen takes to them quickly as well. The only downside is that Francois is way too perceptive and the third time they purposely leave a room so that Senku and Gen can be alone, Gen realizes he might have a problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I really that obvious, Francois-chan?\u201d he asks, reaching for another handful of dried berries.</p>\n<p>Francois doesn\u2019t even look up from the dough they\u2019re kneading. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried that the others have picked up on your feelings for Ishigami Senku, do not fear. I am merely attuned to slight shifts in behavior. It is my duty as a butler to read my master\u2019s every whim, sometimes before even he is aware of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Gen presses the berries into his own dough mechanically.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis concerns you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really something I like to think about. Knowing that someone else knows\u2014\u201d he smiles blankly. \u201cI\u2019m not thrilled about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRest assured, I am the only one who has picked up on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s somewhat of a relief, but, really, Francois-chan, you don\u2019t have to play matchmaker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apologies for any confusion, Asagiri-san\u2014\u201d Francois settles their dough in a perfect little mound and looks up, fixing Gen with a steady gaze. \u201cMy matchmaking hasn\u2019t been in response to <em>your</em> feelings. I have been acting on Ishigami Senku\u2019s desires.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s hands reflexively dig into the dough. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThroughout my interactions with him, I have surmised that Ishigami Senku wishes to spend more time alone with you, thus I have endeavored to fulfill that desire whenever it is within my power to do so. Initially, I concluded that you share this wish as well. If I am mistaken, of course I will defer to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen stares at the dough squishing out between his fingers. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, my apologies. I thought you were aware.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAware.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat Ishigami Senku enjoys spending time with you and wishes to do it more often. Unlike you, he is not so subtle in his desires.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen giggles, trying to keep it from sounding too manic, and presses the dough back into shape. \u201cOf course he enjoys my company, Francois-chan. I\u2019m a treasure and we\u2019ve been, dare I say it, friends for over a year now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsagiri-san, please don\u2019t make me correct such a blatant attempt at falsehood.\u201d Francois coolly sets their dough aside and powders the table with another pinch of flour. \u201cYou know as well as I that Ishigami Senku\u2019s feelings for you exceed those of mere friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Gen can process <em>that</em>, Chrome is running up, shouting something about pigs, and Gen can only go along helplessly.</p>\n<p>So Francois, one of the smartest people on the planet, probably even without the petrification, seems to be laboring under the delusion that Senku has distinctive non-friendship feelings for Gen. How unfortunate. How...distracting.</p>\n<p>Now his midnight ruminations have a whole new dimension to torture him with.</p>\n<p>Senku is all over the place these days, in the air and on the water, back and forth between the village and the ship-building site, always doing and thinking about a million different things, and it\u2019s not like Gen isn\u2019t busy too, so the amount of time they spend together varies wildly. Now that he\u2019s painfully aware of it (courtesy of Francois) Gen can\u2019t ignore how Senku tries to stay nearby. If he has to switch locations, he comes up with a reason for Gen to come along, and if they have to act separately, Senku arranges frequent phone calls, ostensibly for management purposes. It\u2019s definitely helpful to coordinate their movements, but Gen thinks they spend too much time snickering like schoolboys over the line for it to be completely professional.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what have we learned from this?\u201d Gen asks, cheek propped on one hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Ryusui ride the minecart unsupervised,\u201d comes Senku\u2019s droll, tinny reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Senku-chan, that seems like common sense. I thought you were supposed to be a genius?\u201d It\u2019s way too late but Gen is still sitting on the floor of the observatory, listening to Senku recount an unfortunate incident at the mine, his face aching from smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t be on all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. And Ryusui can be hard to handle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my, Senku-chan, do I detect a note of bitterness?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe quality of this phone isn\u2019t high enough for you to detect anything, mentalist.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen laughs. \u201cBut I know you, Senku-chan.\u201d <em>I know you</em>. <em>I\u2019ve known you</em>. His smile freezes on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Senku sighs. \u201cThough I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Gen forces out.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a faint rustling on the other end of the line, like Senku shifting his weight. \u201cEverything okay over there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Senku-chan!\u201d Gen says quickly. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sound weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe quality of this phone isn\u2019t high enough for you to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah\u2014\u201d a short burst of static, like Senku huffing out a laugh right into the mic. \u201cSuch a comedian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do my best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh\u2014\u201d Senku clears his throat and Gen tilts his head, listening intently. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s stomach swoops involuntarily. \u201cOkay? Everyone will be excited to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d more shuffling. Gen pulls the earpiece back to raise an eyebrow at it. \u201cAnyway\u2014uh, it\u2019s late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery observant, Senku-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to sleep, mentalist,\u201d Senku says shortly, and before Gen can respond, the line goes dead.</p>\n<p>Gen squints at the blocky structure of the phone. What was all that about? With a sigh, he replaces the mic and the speaker in their cradles and pulls his blanket tighter around himself, turning his face into the starlight streaming in through the ceiling hatch.</p>\n<p>He has a place to sleep in the village proper, but when he\u2019s here, he prefers to stay in the observatory. It\u2019s strange being here without Senku, but it\u2019s also the place in the village that feels the most like him. Even the thought makes him feel like a pining maiden, but all his efforts to switch his emotions off have have come to naught, so he just buckles down and lets the inconvenient longing wash over him.</p>\n<p>Above him, Sirius twinkles, a little out of place, and Gen wonders if Senku is looking at it too, so many miles away. It\u2019s all so familiar. It\u2019s all so new.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"messagebody\">\n<span class=\"text\">You up</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Yes, but I shouldn\u2019t be.

You\u2019re going to be so irritated in the morning.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">But as long as we\u2019re being honest.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">I wish I was there too.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Sensei?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Are you asleep?</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"breply\">Good night, sensei.</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>When Senku does arrive a few days later, as promised, he apparently does so in the middle of the night and in complete silence because one minute Gen is fast asleep in the observatory and the next he\u2019s blinking awake to a hand on his shoulder and a voice in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWake up, mentalist, we\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo\u2014what\u2014?\u201d Gen pushes himself up, squinting through the half-light and catching the glint of Senku\u2019s crooked smile. \u201cSenku-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen runs a hand over his eyes. \u201cTrying to sneak up on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d Senku sits back on his heels, allowing Gen to push away the pile of blankets he\u2019d amassed to ward off the encroaching chill of winter. \u201cYou weren\u2019t in your hut. Why are you staying all the way out here?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s too drowsy for this, Gen laments, reaching for his outermost robe to hide the blush warming his cheeks. \u201cNo reason in particular.\u201d He shrugs the robe over his shoulders, pulling it close. \u201cI like looking at the stars as much as the next guy, and sometimes I fall asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d The room is too dim for Gen to read Senku\u2019s expression. \u201cWell, come on, we\u2019ve got places to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlaces?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku rises smoothly, offering a hand to help Gen up. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stomach fluttering, Gen accepts and allows Senku to pull him to his feet.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, the fluttering turns to clenching.</p>\n<p>\u201cSenku-chan, you meanie! You tricked me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did I trick you?\u201d Senku tugs on Gen\u2019s arm but Gen plants his feet and refuses to move. \u201cI never said <em>where</em> we were going!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t play that game with me! I\u2019m the king of vague wording and you knew exactly what you were doing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurnabout is fair play, mentalist!\u201d Senku gives another fruitless tug. \u201cWhat, mad because I got one over on you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen glares. \u201cPlease, this hardly qualifies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you so pissy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause\u2014!\u201d Gen gestures at the massive shape of the inflated hot air balloon tethered to the ground in front of them, so huge it blocks the view of the dark sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gotta go up at some point!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gen demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf nothing else, just to say you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not nearly as vain as you seem to think I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will carry you into that basket if I have to,\u201d Senku warns.</p>\n<p>Gen scoffs. \u201cAs if you could lift me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not strong but I can handle your scrawny ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen turns his nose up haughtily. \u201cGlass houses, Senku-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen\u2014\u201c Senku takes a step into him. \u201cI want to show it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen blinks, taken aback, and Senku uses that moment of weakness to duck down and grab him around the waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201c The world tilts violently and before Gen can react, he\u2019s slung across Senku\u2019s shoulders in a fireman\u2019s carry. He flails against the hands gripping his arm and wrapped around his leg. \u201cSenku-chan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it up, mentalist,\u201d Senku laughs, striding toward the the balloon without hesitation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is kidnapping!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Defeated, Gen hangs morosely over Senku\u2019s shoulders. He knows that if he pushed the issue, Senku would give up, but he also recognizes that Senku would have given up sooner if he didn\u2019t have a good reason to keep trying. The act allows both of them to save face. So, benevolent ally that he is, he permits Senku to deposit him in the basket and only glares a little as Senku swings inside after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you learn that from Kohaku-chan?\u201d he asks snidely.</p>\n<p>Senku sets about untying the tether ropes. \u201cShe said it was the only way I\u2019d ever be able to lift anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably right,\u201d Gen mutters.</p>\n<p>The basket lurches slightly as it loses contact with the ground and Gen grabs the edge in a white-knuckled grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Senku assures him. \u201cI\u2019ve got this. I do this all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, with Ryusui-chan or Chrome-chan.\u201d Gen watches nervously as Senku severs the last rope and turns to stoke the fire. \u201cWhat good am I going to be when we\u2019re about to crash and die?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know how to handle it on my own now.\u201d Senku grins. \u201cAnd we won't be up for that long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, that makes me feel better.\u201d Gen watches the ground sink away from them and has to fight the urge to curl up in a ball.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust enjoy the ride, mentalist. Put it in your next book.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can believe this, I\u2019m not getting a lot of writing done out here, Senku-chan.\u201d The basket bobs past the tree tops and a wave of vertigo washes over him. \u201cMaybe once we solve the grand mystery and save all of humanity, I\u2019ll pen a bestseller about the Prometheus of the new world and how he forced me into a hot air balloon against my will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrometheus of the new world, huh?\u201d Senku joins him at the edge of the basket, leaning way too casually against the wicker. \u201cI kind of like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you miss the part about how I\u2019m going to reveal all of your horrible antics?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReveal away.\u201d Senku waves a dismissive hand. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in being famous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t have much choice in that.\u201d Gen presses his lips together and nervously eyes the rapidly shrinking forest of shadows below them. \u201cHow does anyone get used to this?\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHumans didn\u2019t invent flight so they could stare at the ground,\u201d Senku responds, his voice low and suddenly much closer than Gen was anticipating. A calloused hand cups his jaw and tilts his head up before Gen can resist. \u201cLook up, mentalist.\u201d</p>\n<p>A glint of light, sudden and bright, makes Gen squeeze his eyes shut, and when he blinks them open again, he\u2019s greeted by glowing pinks and oranges, early morning hues spilling over the clouds as the balloon rises through them. Gen sucks in an involuntary gasp, crisp air filling his lungs, transfixed by the riot of sunrise colors stretching before him. The sun is still just a glimmer along the horizon, but the rays catch in the dips and rises of the clouds surrounding them, casting the balloon into a sea of light.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s breathtaking.</p>\n<p>A familiar clicking flash jolts Gen out of his stupor and he whirls around in time to see Senku lowering one of Minami\u2019s boxy cameras and grinning impishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSenku-chan, you <em>sneak</em>!\u201d Gen shrieks. He lunges for the camera. \u201cGive me that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku ducks out of the way, jumping to the other side of the basket, crowing with laughter. \u201cNope! You\u2019re too late! I got the new world\u2019s first paparazzi shot of celebrity psychic Asagiri Gen!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get my foot up your ass if you don\u2019t give me that camera!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you run around too much, you\u2019ll tip the basket!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen freezes instantly, grabbing the edge of the basket in terror.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding!\u201d Senku rounds the furnace, eyes wide, and puts a hand on Gen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe counterweights will keep the basket still, and neither of us weigh enough to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Before he can finish, Gen snatches the camera out of his hand and leaps nimbly to the other side of the basket. He sticks his tongue out at Senku\u2019s dumbfounded expression. \u201cDon\u2019t play with me, Senku-chan. You won\u2019t win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku blinks and huffs out a breath, sticking his hands on his hips. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen turns the camera over in his hands, frowning and fiddling with the little details. \u201cIt\u2019s lighter than I thought it\u2019d be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically just wood and a mirror.\u201d Senku creeps hesitantly to his side. \u201cNothing like the ones we\u2019re used to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen examines the gears on the front of the camera. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually held one of these yet. Even though the whole thing was kind of my idea anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve pretty much avoided the cameras altogether.\u201d Senku crosses his arms and leans back against the edge of the basket, watching Gen shrewdly. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, of course not.\u201d Gen rolls his eyes. \u201cNothing gets past you, Senku-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have thought celebrity psychic Asagiri Gen would be first in line for the limelight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen glances up at Senku, lips curling in a rueful smile. \u201cCelebrity psychic Asagiri Gen doesn\u2019t really exist anymore, Senku-chan. What good does the limelight do me now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku returns his gaze, eyes glittering, face dyed half-pink in the pastel sunrise. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good point. Our old selves...they vanished thousands of years ago. I guess none of those people really exist anymore.\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cStill, a shallow man like you doesn\u2019t want to be in the history books?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tracing a nail over the smooth wood grain of the camera body, Gen looks back down into the lens, pursing his lips at the tiny, distorted version of himself reflected there. \u201cI don\u2019t really need people looking at me anymore,\u201d he says thoughtfully. His former status has never really crossed his mind. Unlike Ryusui, eager to regain what he lost, and Francois, eager to return to the position they find most fitting, Gen has found himself content to use his skills for Senku\u2019s benefit, furthering his plans. Before, he only sought notoriety because it was the best way to advance his craft while making a living. He enjoyed the attention, of course; he was young and cute, why wouldn\u2019t he? But he never sought fame for fame\u2019s sake. \u201cI suppose I never really needed it,\u201d he finishes quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy go for it in the first place, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes life just take you where it takes you, Senku-chan,\u201d Gen smiles. \u201cThings happened, and suddenly I was in magazines and on TV. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I liked it. I was being appreciated for my art, after all. But now\u2014\u201d Gen leans over to settle the bulky camera on the floor of the basket, careful despite his earlier protests. He doesn\u2019t actually want to damage one of Senku\u2019s survey instruments. When he straightens back up, Senku is eyeing him searchingly. \u201cNow, <em>you</em> appreciate my hard work, right, Senku-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>One side of Senku\u2019s mouth curls up in a slanted smirk. \u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen claps his hands together. \u201cThen that\u2019s all I need!\u201d Giggling, he turns to face the sky, bracing his forearms on the rim of the basket and leaning out enough to let the wind ruffle his hair. \u201cI\u2019m a bit different behind the cameras, anyway. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a fan of yours or anything.\u201d Senku scratches his cheek, shifting to face into the basket, one hand still resting on the edge, inches from Gen\u2019s arm. \u201cBut I guess so. From what I saw, anyway. Always putting on a show.\u201d He huffs out a breath. \u201cLike how you used to be, when we first met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say? Old habits die hard.\u201d Gen tilts his head back, enjoying the brisk air on his flushed skin. \u201cWe all act differently when we\u2019re being watched, I suppose. There\u2019s a scienc-y term for that, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the broadest sense, yes, I guess that falls under the observer effect.\u201d</p>\n<p>A chill that has nothing to do with the cold runs up Gen\u2019s spine. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard of that one,\u201d he says evenly, keeping his eyes fixed on the cloud-scudded sky in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s different from the uncertainty principle, right? You wrote them on separate cards in my deck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku lets out a quiet snort. \u201c<em>Of course</em> they\u2019re different. When you get down to it, they\u2019re completely different phenomenons, so that confusion is mostly just ignorance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen hums absently, heart pounding. He could tip the scales right now. Spill everything.</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha\u2019s aggrieved face flashes across his mind.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThat\u2019s </em>you<em>!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is anymore.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not the person Senku texted accidentally. No matter what, he\u2019ll never be him again. But\u2014</p>\n<p><em>I guess none of those people really exist anymore</em>.</p>\n<p>With Senku\u2019s own words ringing in his ears, Gen throws caution to the winds whirling past their balloon. \u201cYou know, I never did find out what exactly Neils Bohr had to do with all that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy\u2014\u201d Senku starts immediately, \u201c\u2014back when the theories were new, along with the entire concept of an observable quantum state, there was a lot of debate...about\u2026.\u201d he trails off and Gen hears him inhale haltingly.</p>\n<p>Fighting to keep his expression neutral, Gen pushes himself upright and turns to face Senku directly, finding him staring wide-eyed at the floor. \u201cGo on, sensei,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI want to hear the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slowly, Senku raises his head. \u201cIs this a trick?\u201d he asks, words so quiet they\u2019re nearly snatched away by the wind.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d do something so cruel?\u201d Gen shoots back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Senku straightens up, one hand twitching abortively toward Gen. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTen billion percent!\u201d Gen smiles brightly to hide the nervous twisting of his stomach. \u201cQuite a coincidence, huh, Senku-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>To his horror, Senku drops his head, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know this probably isn\u2019t what you expected,\u201d Gen babbles, trying to cover the terrifying silence. \u201cBelieve me, I was surprised too\u2014I would have mentioned it earlier, but you have to agree it\u2019s a bit of a strange topic\u2014and I apologize if you\u2019re disappointed, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGen,\u201d Senku rasps. \u201cJust\u2014be quiet for a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen snaps his mouth shut so quickly his teeth click together.</p>\n<p>Senku takes a few deep breaths. Tucking his hands into his sleeves anxiously, Gen watches Senku\u2019s shoulders rise and fall, hardly daring to breathe himself. Then Senku\u2019s shoulders stutter. Senku flattens both hands against his face and, actually, this is worse than the silence. Gen is seized with panic at the realization that he\u2019s made the Prometheus of the new world cry.</p>\n<p>\u201cSenku-chan, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou absolute <em>bastard</em>\u2014\u201d Senku jerks his head up, revealing a wide, toothy grin.</p>\n<p>Gen blinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have <em>any</em> idea how much I worried about you?\u201d Senku demands. \u201cI had no idea where to even look for you! I\u2019ve been wracking my memory for clues, but that stupid rule we had\u2014if only I\u2019d been nosier, asked more questions\u2014I thought I\u2019d never see you again!\u201d</p>\n<p>Me\u2014me too!\u201d Gen lurches forward, propelled by the sudden swell of joy in his chest, and grabs Senku\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never\u2014I mean we never even sent each other pictures, so how could we\u2014I\u2013I missed you so much!\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku grips Gen\u2019s shoulders in response, still beaming. \u201cI missed you too!\u201d</p>\n<p>A laugh, wild and ecstatic, tumbles out before Gen can stop it. \u201cThe stupidest thing is\u2014you always reminded me so much of Sensei. I should have realized, I should have\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Senku tugs Gen in closer. \u201cYou seemed familiar too, and the way you talked, sometimes I could have <em>sworn,</em> but the odds of that\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAstronomical,\u201d Gen breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe it was possible if it wasn\u2019t happening right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes\u2014sometimes\u2014\u201c Gen\u2019s fingers curl into the material of Senku\u2019s clothes, the soft hide bunching in his grasp, and meets Senku\u2019s shining gaze with watering eyes. \u201cSometimes I could hardly stand it\u2014you were <em>so like him</em>, it almost hurt, like you were reminding me how much I screwed up\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have known\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not, but\u2014\u201c Gen searches Senku\u2019s face, taking it in like it\u2019s the first time all over again. The sharp brow, the thin lips, the shrewd eyes, the jagged scars\u2014it\u2019s all Senku, but now, for the first time since he found out, Gen finally accepts that it\u2019s Sensei as well. \u201cSenku-chan, I just\u2014I missed you so much!\u201d Eyes swimming with tears, he pulls Senku in, wrapping his arms around his neck in their second ever hug.</p>\n<p>Senku responds instantly, embracing Gen tightly, and he\u2019s so warm, hands like branding irons against Gen\u2019s back. \u201cI knew you,\u201d he murmurs in Gen\u2019s ear. \u201cFrom the second I met you, I knew you. I always told myself it was impossible, that I was just deluding myself out of misery but\u2014something inside me still knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen chokes out a laugh. \u201cThat was your heart, Senku-chan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPreposterous.\u201d But when Senku leans back, his smile is the softest Gen has ever seen it. \u201cInstinct, maybe. The odds that this would even happen\u2014I still can\u2019t wrap my head around it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFate,\u201d Gen suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as fate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless, I think you\u2019re my fate, Senku-chan.\u201d Gen places his hands on Senku\u2019s cheeks, framing his face. \u201cHow else do you explain us meeting against all odds <em>twice</em>? Out of a whole world, you texted me, and out of a whole country, Tsukasa found me to track you down. There\u2019s good luck and then there\u2019s <em>destiny</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku rolls his eyes. \u201cThe circumstances are unbelievable, but to attribute them to concepts like fate and destiny is simply\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Gen cuts him off by leaning forward and pressing their mouths together, trapping the rest of Senku\u2019s words between their lips.</p>\n<p>When he pulls back, Senku is staring at him, eyes wide and jaw slack.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you could miss such an obvious romantic set-up, Senku-chan,\u201d Gen smiles coyly. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day a cute boy tells you you\u2019re his destiny, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little\u2014\u201c then there\u2019s a hand on the back of his head and Senku is hauling him back in, sealing their mouths together again.</p>\n<p>Gen didn\u2019t wake up that morning expecting to be kissing Ishigami Senku in a hot air balloon before the sun was even completely up, but now that he\u2019s here, hands fisted in Senku\u2019s collar, pressed against Senku\u2019s chest, completely protected from the chill by the heat growing between them\u2014Gen can\u2019t imagine being anywhere else.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always bothered me,\u201d Gen says, a few hours later, watching Senku go through the process of developing the camera film in the lab. \u201cOur last conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku hums, submerging the plate in a vat of some chemical. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to check my phone before I started my show.\u201d Gen leans over the vat curiously. \u201cAnd we were arguing. What did you send me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Senku sets his little tongs aside and turns to face Gen, propping one hip against the table. \u201cJust something about your unsalvageable taste and the tragedy of modern science fiction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen laughs. \u201cYeah, I guessed as much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku reaches out, tracing his fingers down the opening in Gen\u2019s robe. Gen watches raptly as he pinches the material, absently dragging his thumbnail over the edge. \u201cIt always bothered me too,\u201d Senku confesses lowly. \u201cThinking that was the last thing I ever said to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heart thudding, Gen rests a hand on Senku\u2019s wrist and steps into him. \u201cFortunately, you\u2019ll have an infinite number of opportunities to berate me for my poor taste in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku flicks his eyes up to Gen\u2019s, a smirk creeping across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll get started on that right away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen giggles, pressing one sleeve to his mouth. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hold back, sensei.\u201d He starts, remembering. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You must already know that I named your contact <em>Sensei</em> in my phone, but what did you call me? Something cute, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>The hand on Gen\u2019s robe stills. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, mentalist,\u201d Senku says dryly. \u201cI labelled your contact <em>machigatta bang\u014d</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen blinks. \u201cYou...you called me <em>wrong number</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I knew your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo cold, Senku-chan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI shortened it to Ma-ban after a while, and Taiju and Yuzuriha both called you Ma-ban-san.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not much better!\u201d Gen summons some tears and dabs at the corner of his eye. \u201cI should have called you <em>science nerd</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku grins. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have known you\u2019d choose something boring,\u201d Gen laments.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really not sure why you\u2019re so worked up.\u201d Using his grip on Gen\u2019s robe, Senku tugs him even closer, until Gen is practically in his lap. \u201cThink about it this way: I talked about you so much, I had to give you a nickname.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen pouts obstinately. \u201cI\u2019m still heartbroken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat must be so hard for you.\u201d Senku glances to the side. \u201cLooks like the film is done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, Gen steps back and Senku fishes the plate out of the vat, shaking it a few times to flick the solution off.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Senku asks as Gen peers over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the quality can\u2019t hold a candle to the cameras of the past, but it\u2019s undeniably him, washed out by the sunlight and gaping like an idiot. \u201cDestroy it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku laughs. \u201cNo way. This is a collector\u2019s item.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen rolls his eyes. \u201cI thought you disliked sentiment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unproductive,\u201d Senku agrees, setting the plate safely out of the way. \u201cBut this is different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of responding, Senku snags Gen by the robe and hauls him in again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Senku-chan, it\u2019s not a handle\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about you everyday for thirty-seven hundred years,\u201d Senku cuts in, eyes shining. \u201cThat\u2019s brainpower I could have been using for something else. Now that I know where you are, my productivity is about to shoot through the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>A smile unfolds inexorably across Gen\u2019s face and he drapes his arms over Senku\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSo utilitarian,\u201d he chuckles, brushing their foreheads together. \u201cBut, really, this is exactly what I expected. I\u2019m so flattered to be a waste of brainpower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t realize who you were sooner,\u201d Senku mutters. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious now. No one\u2019s ever annoyed me like you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gen huffs. \u201cSame here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuzuriha is going to be so happy, Gen thinks absently as Senku winds his arms around his waist and he slides one hand into Senku\u2019s hair. And once she clues Taiju in, he\u2019ll probably lose it. The villagers will be confused by the full story, but the modern folks will probably go nuts. Ryusui will be unbearably smug, and Francois will just smile mildly like always. Gen can\u2019t help giggling against Senku\u2019s mouth at the thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Senku rumbles.</p>\n<p>Gen\u2019s smile grows. \u201cNothing. Just thinking about who\u2019s responsible for all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senku pulls back slightly to quirk an eyebrow at him. \u201cAnd who would that be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Grinning now, Gen smooths Senku\u2019s hair out of his face. \u201cBohr-chan, of course!\u201d</p>\n<p>Blinking, Senku smiles slowly in response. \u201cRight. Thanks, Bohr.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Bohr-chan!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Thank you, </em>Gen thinks, laughing joyfully as Senku surges forward to catch the sound in his own mouth. <em>Thank you</em>.</p>"
