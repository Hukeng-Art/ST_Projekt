  "text": "<p>Miya Atsumu is not a quitter.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s <em> not. </em></p>\n<p>Even so, his eyes widen as Sakusa opens up the black leather case. He doesn\u2019t want to back out now\u2014he\u2019s already all bound up, strapped into an elaborate leather harness that pulls his knees up to his chest, thighs buckled to his sides, hands cuffed to the back of his neck and body completely exposed for whatever Sakusa wants to do to him\u2014but Atsumu has to admit that he\u2019s kind of thinking about it when he sees the metal rods.</p>\n<p>The metal rods that Sakusa\u2019s about to put in his <em> dick.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone ever tell ya yer a sadist, Omi-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa snorts, eyes raking over Atsumu\u2019s bound form. \u201cOnce or twice. Lucky for you, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu blushes to the roots of his hair when Sakusa\u2019s eyes linger on his cock, stiff with excitement even as thrills of fear race through him. He really must be fucked in the head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cO-oh\u2014oh god, <em> Omi, </em> I\u2014fuck\u2014I <em> can\u2019t\u2014\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cSure you can,\u201d Sakusa says, pushing the sound deeper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu can only watch in horrified fascination as it disappears inside him, excess lube squeezing out and collecting around his slit. The smooth tip of the sound feels so foreign in such an unfamiliar part of him that it\u2019s actually a little painful, pinpoint discomfort moving slowly up and down <em> inside </em> his cock. It adds an extra layer of helplessness Atsumu has never experienced before.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em> mortifying </em> how much he likes it.</p>\n<p>Atsumu moans in shock when Sakusa holds his cock upright with one gloved hand and lets go of the sound with the other, both of them watching as gravity pulls the slim metal rod down, <em> down </em> , touching Atsumu in places he didn\u2019t know he <em> could </em>be touched. It only stops once the bulbous cap at the end of the sound settles snugly against him. Atsumu\u2019s mouth drops open and he watches in disbelief when Sakusa squeezes him and gives him a few slick strokes with his dick stuffed full.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, you took the whole thing,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, dispassionate eyes flitting up to Atsumu\u2019s face for just a moment before focusing back on his cock. \u201cJust swallowed it all up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Uuhngh,\u201d </em>Atsumu groans, toes curling as the uncomfortable feeling morphs into confusing pleasure.</p>\n<p>He throws his head back\u2014as much as the harness allows him to\u2014and cries out hoarsely when Sakusa begins gradually pulling the sound out. Atsumu\u2019s hips twitch and buck, chest heaving as he grapples with a sensation close to <em> coming, </em>syrupy-slow but frustratingly unsatisfying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay still,\u201d Sakusa tells him. \u201cYou can do that for me, right, Atsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s not sure. He wants to, but his body\u2019s not exactly obeying his brain right now. He shivers and nods, trying his hardest not to move as Sakusa gently sinks the sound back inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm, good boy.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Fuck. </em>Goosebumps break out on Atsumu\u2019s skin and he bites his lip, letting the praise wash over him as Sakusa gives his cock a couple more strokes. Flames are stirring in his gut and it\u2019s taking everything he has to keep his hips still. When Atsumu can\u2019t look away any longer, he glances down to see Sakusa\u2019s intense gaze trained on his face; after Atsumu blinks, Sakusa\u2019s back to concentrating on his dick, and he wonders if he imagined it.</p>\n<p>God, he hopes he didn\u2019t. Atsumu loves having Sakusa\u2019s eyes on him. He wonders if Sakusa\u2019s going to jerk off on him again; his dick honest-to-god twitches in Sakusa\u2019s hand just thinking about it.</p>\n<p>Then all his thoughts fly out of his head when Sakusa starts fucking him with the sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuckfuckfuck,\u201d Atsumu slurs, eyes wide as he just about hyperventilates watching it. Sakusa isn\u2019t moving it fast or hard, it just\u2014the way it <em>feels\u2014</em> <em>\u201cShit, </em>I\u2014<em>Omi\u2014\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Sakusa makes a low noise. \u201cYeah? You like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s face flushes hot and he shakes his head, too embarrassed to admit it.</p>\n<p>Sakusa laughs. \u201cYou and I both know that wasn\u2019t really a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>He presses his thumb to the underside of Atsumu\u2019s dick, and on the next drag out Atsumu <em> screams </em>at what the added pressure does to the movement of the sound. The sensation isn\u2019t ambiguous anymore, it\u2019s definitely pain, and Atsumu\u2014Atsumu wants more of it\u2014</p>\n<p>He whimpers when Sakusa lets up on the pressure before pushing the sound back inside. It slides in deep again, all the way to the hilt; Sakusa places a finger on the tip of the sound to keep it in place, then starts to rock it gently back and forth.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyes bulge and he makes a noise he\u2019s never made before. The sound\u2019s touching him so deep it feels like it\u2019s rubbing his prostate. He chokes on his own breath and tugs on his restraints, only managing to dig the cuffs into his wrists and thighs as he squirms at the deep pressure. No matter how he tries to move, he can\u2019t get away from it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never felt anything like this before and it\u2019s starting to scare him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I told you to stay still,\u201d Sakusa says.</p>\n<p>Atsumu groans, fire and adrenaline dancing through his veins. He feels like he did during their very first scene together, like he\u2019s not going to make it through this, like it\u2019s all he can do to stay conscious. Every time Sakusa moves the sound it makes Atsumu\u2019s gut twist up like he\u2019s about to come; he can\u2019t even tell if he\u2019s actually close or if his body\u2019s just confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuu<em>uuck </em>, Omi, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He howls when Sakusa draws the sound all the way out, thighs quivering from the addicting discomfort. Atsumu\u2019s dick feels a little sore inside, probably from the way the sound was rubbing his urethra, but he\u2019s able to unclench his jaw now that it\u2019s out. He feels like he can breathe again. <em> Fuck, </em>that was intense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa stares at him with heated eyes as he sets the metal rod down on a clean washcloth, then wraps both gloved hands around Atsumu\u2019s dick, stroking him up and down and gathering up the excess lube from the tip. Atsumu moans as Sakusa works him, shoulders cramping as he tugs at his wrist cuffs. He thinks about how it felt to have Sakusa\u2019s hand around him with the sound inside and his head spins with horror as he realizes that he misses it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Shlick, shlick, shlick. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god\u2014ungh, <em> haah </em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t\u2014his lungs are freezing up\u2014now that he knows what it feels like he wonders if he\u2019ll ever be able to forget\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, swiping his thumb over the leaking head of Atsumu\u2019s cock. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so well, Atsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes both hands away and strips off his gloves as Atsumu watches with foggy confusion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Sakusa pulls on a fresh pair of gloves and opens a new little packet of lube. \u201cAnd neither are you. I think you can take more.\u201d</p>\n<p>He picks up a new sound from the black leather case.</p>\n<p>A bigger one.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyes go wide and panic seizes him as Sakusa dips the tip of the sound in the lube. It\u2019s thicker than the last one; it makes his stomach drop looking at it, and he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s in a good way. Dread starts to overpower his excitement and curiosity\u2014he can\u2019t get away\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t, I\u2014<em>I\u2014\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa laughs, the sound echoing inside Atsumu\u2019s head as he brings the metal rod toward his dick, stiff and vulnerable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou always say that, but then you always\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYellow.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>The word falls from Atsumu\u2019s lips before he\u2019s even aware he made the decision. Sakusa sits back on his heels immediately, setting the sound down and stripping off his gloves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sight makes Atsumu realize exactly what he just said.</p>\n<p>Part of him wants to take it back even as the rest of him sags in relief. He\u2019s been so fixated on being <em> good, </em>on showing Sakusa he can take it, that he never considered how it would feel if he actually wanted to back out or slow down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk to me, Atsumu. What do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s voice is calm but firm, almost\u2026 kind. Atsumu settles imperceptibly inside his own head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, um. I just...\u201d he swallows, glancing toward where he knows the thicker sound is waiting on the cloth. Among all the confusing sensations and prickling pain, he actually did enjoy the first one, but... \u201cI need a minute\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly okay. Do you want to stop?\u201d Sakusa asks. Atsumu\u2019s throat tightens. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if you do. You won\u2019t disappoint me at all if you want to say red. I have plenty of other things I\u2019d like to do if this isn\u2019t getting you where I want you to be...\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa is clearly giving him an out, but Atsumu appreciates that he seems to be maintaining at least a thread of the scene. It soothes the spike of anxiety, the shadow of failure that tried to rise up in Atsumu\u2019s chest as soon as he pressed pause. This is why they use stoplights, just like Sakusa taught him; Atsumu can stop this if he wants to, but he doesn\u2019t <em> have to, </em> even if he needs a minute.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu? I need you to answer me,\u201d Sakusa prompts when Atsumu takes a second to respond. \u201cDo you want to stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu shakes his head. It\u2019s the truth, once he gives himself a second to really think about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sakusa says again. He reaches for a glass of water perched on the bedside table. \u201cHere, take a sip.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way Atsumu is bound restricts him from leaning up very much, but water sounds like a very good idea right now. He only struggles to crane his neck toward the glass for a second before Sakusa\u2019s sliding a hand under his shoulders and helping him sit semi-upright as he brings the glass to his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu takes one sip, then another. His mouth is dry and the water feels good on his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink too much too fast,\u201d Sakusa says.</p>\n<p>Atsumu hums in agreement and pulls away after a few more sips, relaxing his abs and letting Sakusa lower him the rest of the way down. Sakusa\u2019s hand lingers for a fraction of a moment in Atsumu\u2019s hair as he draws it away before he leans back on his heels, setting the glass of water back on the nightstand.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Atsumu sighs, relaxing into the bed. He doesn\u2019t expect the feeling of <em> safety </em> that washes over him now that he\u2019s had a minute to calm down.</p>\n<p>He also doesn\u2019t expect the way Sakusa leans back in and cups the side of his face, dark eyes intense as his thumb strokes over Atsumu\u2019s cheek. Atsumu barely suppresses a squeak, belly swooping as Sakusa squints at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to do anything you don\u2019t want,\u201d Sakusa murmurs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the surface, it seems like an obvious statement. Atsumu sure <em> hopes </em>Sakusa would never do anything Atsumu didn\u2019t want. That should go without saying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he thinks about it a little more and feels his face heat. Sakusa\u2019s done some pretty fucked-up stuff to him the past couple months, and Atsumu\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em> Atsumu has wanted every second of it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>The embarrassment just makes him harder. He turns his face into his bicep and breathes in, out, in, out. He <em> wanted </em> to be edged until he was a shaking, babbling mess. He <em> wanted </em> to be hit with a riding crop until he forgot his own name. He <em> wanted </em>to be blindfolded and have burning hot wax poured all over him while he screamed into a gag.</p>\n<p>And now, he wants\u2026 he wants Sakusa to use the bigger sound and play with his dick inside and out until he\u2019s begging to come.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu swallows, glancing at Sakusa out of the corner of his eye. \u201cKeep goin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Sakusa asks, with one raised brow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods.</p>\n<p>Sakusa squints at him again, but this time Atsumu\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s a smile. \u201cOkay. I take it you\u2019re feeling better?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods, watching as Sakusa grabs a fresh pair of gloves and pulls them on while he shifts back into position between Atsumu\u2019s thighs. He remembers a time when having Sakusa between his spread legs like this embarrassed him; now it just feels natural.</p>\n<p>Sakusa picks up the bigger sound, the one he was about to use before Atsumu needed to press pause. \u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom now on, every time you say \u2018green,\u2019 I know I can trust you. That means I can go even further, Atsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>He squeezes lube onto the thicker rod like he didn\u2019t just send butterflies reeling in Atsumu\u2019s stomach. He was honestly a little worried that Sakusa would be annoyed with him for interrupting the scene, but it sounds like Sakusa is <em> pleased. </em></p>\n<p>Atsumu gasps when Sakusa takes hold of him again, grasping the tip of his cock with one gloved hand and holding it upright as he positions the thicker sound right over the slit.</p>\n<p>\u201cColor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sucks in a breath, thinking about what Sakusa just told him. Not only does he want this, he\u2019s <em> leaking </em>for it. His blush, already burning his face, starts to spread down his chest, to the point where Atsumu himself can see it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cGreen.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa starts to guide the sound inside and Atsumu wails.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Onigiri Miya is lively for a restaurant with a closed sign in the window. There aren\u2019t even that many people inside, but a half dozen tipsy professional athletes and their former athlete friends take up a lot of space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu, are you really still pouting?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not poutin\u2019!\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu is pouting, just a little, where he stands behind the counter with Osamu, making rice ball after rice ball. There\u2019s never more than three on the bar at a time before they\u2019re grabbed and gobbled up by the pack of monster generation volleyball players from EJP Raijin and the MSBY Black Jackals. Atsumu thinks he\u2019s probably made fifty by now, but keeps his mouth shut knowing the hell Osamu would give him for remarking on such a small number from his perspective.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou lost <em> one game</em>,\u201d Suna says, sitting across the bar from the twins. \u201cThe Jackals have been leapfrogging the Adlers all year for first place in the league and you\u2019re still whining?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suna doesn\u2019t get it; the dogfight for first is the <em> point. </em> Atsumu grinds his teeth as he resists checking the Adlers score online again. They were up on the Green Rockets last time he checked and, if they win their game tonight, they\u2019ll take first place again. Sure, nobody expected any team to challenge the Adlers during the off season, especially after Romero signed with them. A lot of folks thought that pretty much locked them in, not just as first in the league, but also expected them to basically waltz through the Emperor's Cup.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the Jackals added Sakusa to their already solid, young roster, which analysts thought made the Jackals likely to challenge for top three\u2014and then they debuted Hinata Shoyo and started shattering expectations. A wry smile crosses Atsumu\u2019s face as he spies the orange-haired dark horse sitting at a table in the corner with Inunaki and Raijin\u2019s back-up libero, just behind a table that holds Bokuto, Washio, and Akaashi, who came down for the weekend for the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Anyway </em>,\u201d Osamu interrupts before Atsumu can defend himself. \u201cAre ya still seein\u2019 Fuyuki-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you even askin\u2019? His story had like twelve pictures of her just yesterday,\u201d Atsumu says and then winces as he reaches into a new bowl of rice that\u2019s still a bit too hot for his unweathered fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. You do post way too many photos on instagram of you two,\u201d Osamu backs him up, nodding in acknowledgement as Raijin\u2019s Komori grabs a pair of beers from the flat at the counter and then heads back to his and Sakusa\u2019s table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you complaining when I posted pictures of your rice balls,\u201d Suna narrows his eyes, \u201cShe\u2019s a model. She has to make sure she has a lot of visibility and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Model</em>,\u201d Atsumu teases.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Influencer</em>,\u201d Osamu continues. \u201cAnyway, how are things goin\u2019 with your <em> model </em> girlfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suna crosses his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know this is why I don\u2019t miss you guys that much,\u201d he says and the twins snicker. \u201cIt\u2019s going <em> fine. </em>Anyway, enough about my dating life since apparently you already know eveyrthing. What about you two?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu shrugs, \u201cHaven\u2019t really been seein\u2019 anyone. It\u2019s been so busy with the restaurant and tryin\u2019 to open a location in Tokyo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been datin' either,\u201d Atsumu says, technically not lying, and then glares back at Osamu who is side-eying him for a shoddy nori wrap.</p>\n<p><em> If ya want me to keep helping, ya better keep yer mouth shut </em> , he says with his eyes, and Osamu rolls his own as if to say a simple <em> whatever </em> as he pulls the plate of fresh onigiri towards him and takes over wrapping duties.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Suna says, not privy to the silent twin conversation; Atsumu looks back at him. \u201cYou\u2019re always dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019ve been busy, too!\u201d Atsumu says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, two sets of eyes are turned on him, dripping with suspicion. Atsumu\u2019s shoulders come up, preemptively defensive because now Osamu\u2019s attention is captured as well. This doesn\u2019t bode well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing busy has literally never stopped ya once in your life from at least\u2026 talkin\u2019 to someone,\u201d Osamu says with narrowing eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damn Suna for drawing attention to this. They\u2019d been functioning fine under the don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell that Osamu\u2019s been begging for since Atsumu first got caught behind the gymnasium kissing a classmate after middle school graduation. But now Osamu smells a rat and Suna knows it, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Atsumu. Why haven\u2019t you been dating?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu opens his mouth, suddenly feeling like he\u2019s trapped behind enemy lines. Osamu doesn\u2019t even let Atsumu answer. His gaze is now somewhere between confused and intrigued.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s not it. He hasn\u2019t <em> not </em> been datin\u2019. He\u2019d pro\u2019bly talk about that <em> more </em> than he constantly talks about dating. He hasn\u2019t said anythin\u2019 all season,\u201d Osamu says, verbally processing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good point,\u201d Suna muses, egging Osamu on, the bastard.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he\u2019s lyin\u2019, which means it\u2019s someone he doesn\u2019t want people ta know about,\u201d Osamu continues, curiosity mounting in his tone, and for some reason Atsumu is stunned stupid. He should have prepared for this. \u201cBut he has almost no shame, so it\u2019d have to be pretty crazy, even for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s crazy for Atsumu?\u201d Suna asks, looking like the cat that got the cream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu scoffs, finally mobilizing. Just brush it off. He turns back to the bowl of rice and starts putting a scoop of filling into a new shell of an onigiri.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna sit here and listen to yer <em> slander </em>,\u201d Atsumu bluffs. He pushes on, ignoring that they clearly aren\u2019t taking the bait yet. He begins to press the rice into a less than perfect triangle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit<em>,</em>\u201d Osamu says and then looks over at Suna. \u201cHe\u2019s datin\u2019 a teammate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suna\u2019s eyes go wide and Atsumu sputters, barely holding back the panic that would fully expose him. Instead he hisses, \u201cListen, Sherlock, I\u2019m not <em> datin\u2019 </em>nobody!\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu raises a brow, \u201cSo you\u2019re just <em> seein\u2019 </em> a teammate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shit, Atsumu fucked up. Wrong element to focus on. Oh well, deny until you die.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d Atsumu grouses, but it\u2019s weak enough that Osamu isn\u2019t convinced for even a second\u2014he knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMe </em> don\u2019t be stupid? Yer the stupid one,\u201d Osamu says and then an expression of pure judgment clouds his face. \u201cUhg, please tell me you\u2019re not bangin\u2019 yer captain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m not bangin\u2019 no one!\u201d Atsumu says, stomping off to get a new bowl of rice from the cookers in the back.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s technically true\u2026 by some specific standards, on paper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Atsumu, don\u2019t go. I want to know who it is!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not his captain and he\u2019s not gonna get his contract terminated I don\u2019t care,\u201d Osamu says resolutely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUhg, <em> fine, </em>\u201d Suna whines.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get the gossip when it inevitably blows up in his face,\u201d Osamu says.</p>\n<p>Atsumu hates them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Obasan?\u201d Motoya asks as he drains the last of his beer and then bites into the last rice ball on their table.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, last I heard,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard much from her since she moved. Mostly just public health articles.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Motoya hums, \u201cWell, you\u2019ll get to see everyone at the New Years Eve party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJoy,\u201d Kiyoomi deadpans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Motoya snickers and then stands up. \u201cHold on, gonna grab another beer. You want one?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa shrugs; he\u2019s only had one so far. He pulls an alcohol wipe out of his bag as Motoya wanders over to the counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Motoya is chuckling when he comes back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sakusa asks as he takes the can from Motoya and begins to meticulously wipe the aluminum down with the alcohol wipe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh nothing, they\u2019re just chirping Suna for his insta model girlfriend,\u201d Motoya says, plopping down in his seat again. \u201cSpeaking of, something seems different about you. Plus, two whole beers? Are you seeing someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi freezes, fingers still on the tab of his sanitized can, for only a fraction of a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cYou know how I feel about dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, now that Kinsuke-niisan and Masumi-neesan are married, don\u2019t you think your parents have probably laid off the pedigreed matchmaking?\u201d Motoya says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are few people who understand the stupid intricacies of Kiyoomi\u2019s family dynamics, though Motoya is the closest considering his father is Kiyoomi\u2019s mother\u2019s brother. But even though the Komori family runs in the same affluent circles, Kiyoomi\u2019s family is much more entrenched in bullshit traditions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if they did, I still have my own reasons. I don\u2019t understand how you all are comfortable putting in so much effort with other people when your next contract could take you to a team in Europe or South America,\u201d Kiyoomi muses, watching the people walking down the sidewalk outside. \u201cI just don\u2019t see the point right now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Kiyoomi-kun. Love? Companionship? Sex?\u201d Motoya teases.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi just rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s found many more efficient and enjoyable ways to fulfil his base human needs without coordinating long distance relationships or trying to move a partner across the country or globe. Who needs love when you can make grown men cry and then thank you for it? He casts a quick glance towards Atsumu and can\u2019t help the sly smile that touches his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to grab some more rice balls,\u201d Kiyoomi says, sliding on his mask instead of acquiescing to answer a question to which Motoya already knows the answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi heads towards the counter but is beaten there by Bokuto, who scoops up the five onigiri currently available. Oblivious, he bounces back towards his table to place three on Akaashi\u2019s plate, at least deigning to give Washio one. He smacks a kiss on the top of Akaashi\u2019s head as he goes to sit down, then realizes he accidentally got some rice in Akaashi\u2019s hair and goes to pick it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi makes a mildly disgusted face. He\u2019s distracted by a laugh from Atsumu, who definitely caught the whole scene, including his reaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Omi-Omi. <em> Keiji is hungry~, </em>\u201d he imitates their ever-passionate teammate. \u201cJus\u2019 hold on a second and I\u2019ll make ya some.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu is now alone behind the counter. Kiyoomi can hear Suna and Osamu chatting about the kitchen set-up in the back. He leans forward on his elbows a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou washed your hands, right?\u201d Kiyoomi wants to hear verbal confirmation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, m\u2019not an animal, Omi-kun,\u201d he says, flicking a piece of rice at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi shrugs unapologetically, a little at a loss for what to do just standing at the counter watching Atsumu form onigiri. He\u2019s better at it than Kiyoomi expected. He supposes Osamu\u2019s interest didn\u2019t come out of nowhere; Atsumu did mention that they did a lot of their own cooking as kids.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you free on Friday after morning practice?\u201d Kiyoomi finds himself asking, to fill the silence.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s shoulders twitch. He quickly looks over his shoulder before tilting his head back to think, hands still working rice into a rounded triangle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGot a couple errands to run but I could come to yers after, prob\u2019ly by mid-afternoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi nods in affirmation, suppressing any smirk in response to the blush dusting Atsumu\u2019s cheeks, betraying his indifference.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re quiet for another few seconds as Atsumu plates a trio of onigiri and sets them up on the bar for Kiyoomi, who takes them with a muffled thank you.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem. See ya Friday, then,\u201d Atsumu says, giving Kiyoomi an exaggerated wink and a sleazy smile.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi blinks. \u201cWe have practice tomorrow morning. Idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu curses and Kiyoomi ignores him, heading back toward Motoya and taking his seat at the table. His cousin is scrolling through his phone now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Kiyoomi-kun. I know this guy who just moved to Osaka. He designs athletic apparel and happens to be hot as hell,\u201d Motoya says, showing Kiyoomi a picture of a conventionally attractive man with dyed blue hair. \u201cAre you <em> sure </em> you don\u2019t want me to give him your number?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Would he try to cry my name through a gag as I push a frozen plug up his ass? Would he whine prettily and submit to having a metal rod shoved in his urethra while bound into the rough shape of a pretzel? </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi doubts it. He pulls his mask down and takes a bite out of one of his newly acquired rice balls. His brow furrows at the taste and he looks down in confusion. Nestled into the center of the clean, white rice, previously hidden by the nori wrap, there are at least three umeboshi, instead of the usual single pickled plum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Against his will, Kiyoomi\u2019s head turns towards the counter. Suna and Osamu have returned to the counter and Atsumu seems to be squabbling with them. He doesn\u2019t see the way Kiyoomi stares, just for a second. Does Atsumu know that Kiyoomi has a particular preference for umeboshi, and that\u2019s why he\u2026?\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, it has to be a coincidence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKiyoomi-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>He whips his head back around, trying to track back to Motoya\u2019s question. Right, he asked if he could give Kiyoomi\u2019s phone number out to some fashion designer. Kiyoomi\u2019s nose wrinkles.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Really, no thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes another bite of rice and umeboshi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu rushes through his errands after practice and weights. By mid-afternoon he\u2019s swinging through the store to grab some pre-packaged curries for dinner and heading to Sakusa\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To: <b>Omi-Omi </b><br>\n&gt;&gt; Omw</p>\n<p>From: <b>Omi-Omi</b> <b><br>\n</b>&gt;&gt; I\u2019ll leave the front door unlocked\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s oddly casual at this point, parking in the visitor spot, plugging in the front door code, and riding the elevator up the floors of Sakusa\u2019s fancy apartment building. He pushes open the door without knocking and announces himself as he takes his shoes off and lines them up by the wall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu comes around the corner to find Sakusa on his laptop at the dining room table with few pieces of mail stacked up off to the side. He\u2019s wearing a pair of narrow reading glasses and Atsumu has to literally bite his tongue not to make a hot teacher joke. He wouldn\u2019t hold back if they\u2019d already played today, but he\u2019s not willing to risk getting kicked out before the good stuff.</p>\n<p>\u201cI grabbed some stuff for dinner later if you didn\u2019t have something planned,\u201d Atsumu says, holding up the grocery bag.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa glances up, and once again Atsumu swallows down a \u2018<em>I wanted to talk to you about my grades, Sakusa-sensei.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. You can put it on the top shelf of the refrigerator,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cDo you want a cup of tea or anything before you shower?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, yeah,\u201d Atsumu says as he heads to the kitchen to put the curries away. \u201cI had to rush around to a couple of different places and traffic sucked. Tea sounds relaxing.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange that Atsumu doesn\u2019t exactly feel embarrassed to be talking about needing a minute and a cup of tea to get mentally prepared for Sakusa to torture him in some way or another. This is all pretty routine by now. Atsumu has the prior knowledge that, even though he\u2019s excited, rushing into a scene now will make it harder than usual to get out of his own head. He knows it\u2019ll be better if he takes a minute to wind down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa gets up and makes tea as Atsumu heads back into the dining room and takes a seat. He flips open his phone to instagram and only jumps a little when Sakusa sets a mug down on the table. Atsumu drinks his tea, makes shady comments on all his friends\u2019 photos, and Sakusa finishes up paying bills or whatever he\u2019s doing on his laptop. By the time the cup is drained, Atsumu\u2019s head feels quieter and the thrum of nervous energy has risen under his skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and stands up, \u201cOk, I\u2019m going to go hop in the shower.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa takes his glasses off and Atsumu fights the urge to boo.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Meet me in the bedroom when you\u2019re finished,\u201d Sakusa says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu gives him a two finger salute and heads off to get cleaned up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s finished, Atsumu heads down the hall to Sakusa\u2019s room. An uncomfortable wave of apprehension rolls over Atsumu when he walks through the doorway and doesn\u2019t find any new and exciting toys waiting for him. In fact, nothing is set up at all; Atsumu spends a split-second wondering if Sakusa has gotten tired of him before he spots the bottle of lube and box of gloves sitting on the bedside table and something in his chest unclenches.</p>\n<p>The door to the bathroom opens before Atsumu can think any more of it. Sakusa\u2019s wearing a white button-down today with his usual black slacks, rolling up his sleeves as he exits in a cloud of steam and the scent of his body wash fills the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look surprised,\u201d is the first thing Sakusa says to him.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s cheeks heat. \u201cJust wonderin\u2019 if yer goin\u2019 for secrecy again.\u201d He gestures to the empty bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa squints at him. Atsumu likes to think that he\u2019s become somewhat of an expert on Sakusa\u2019s expressions considering half of his face is hidden behind a mask almost all the time. This particular brand of squinting usually goes along with a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, because I haven\u2019t set anything out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods.</p>\n<p>Sakusa chuckles and walks over to the bed. \u201cI\u2019m not tying you up tonight, Atsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for several months now,\u201d Sakusa says, taking a pair of black gloves from the box. He turns to look at Atsumu and raises an eyebrow. \u201cI trust you to hold yourself still for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s mouth runs dry. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember the first time I edged you?\u201d Sakusa interrupts him. Atsumu nods. \u201cYou could barely go for twenty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse <em> me, </em>Omi-kun, I c\u2019n last a lot longer than that now,\u201d Atsumu snaps, with all the elegance of a man slamming his foot into a bear trap.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true, though, even if that wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to say aloud. Edging is one of the most common ways they play, and Atsumu\u2019s been able to hold out longer and longer as he\u2019s gotten more used to it. The orgasms have become stronger too, so much so that whenever Atsumu finally does come he always wishes he\u2019d been able to wait even more. Last time they did it he was able to last for 45 minutes and he nearly blacked out when he came.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you can. And you certainly don\u2019t need six-point restraints now, either,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready to try for an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn <em> hour?\u201d </em> Atsumu\u2019s voice does <em> not </em>crack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa pulls his second glove on with a <em> snap </em>of stretchy nitrile. \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t think you can do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu glares at him. Sometimes he forgets how much of an asshole Sakusa is. \u201cFuck off, \u2018course I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Sakusa hums, then straightens up. \u201cOh, there was <em> one </em>thing I forgot to set out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu clutches his towel as Sakusa walks over to his dresser and crouches down to find something in the bottom drawer. When he turns around, he\u2019s clutching a large plug. Atsumu thinks about trying to make it an hour with that inside him and feels the color drain from his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi, that\u2019s <em> mean.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa laughs quietly. \u201cYou like me mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. He\u2019s right, but like hell Atsumu\u2019s going to tell him that. He glares at the floor, then jolts when Sakusa hooks a finger under his chin and tips his head up to meet his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo and bend over the bed, Atsumu,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI\u2019ll start the clock now, since I know you can come just from getting fingered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyes widen and he wrenches his gaze away from Sakusa\u2019s, color returning furiously to his cheeks as he trembles with a wretched combination of humiliation and arousal. \u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stalks over to the bed and drops his towel, glancing over his shoulder and shivering when he sees Sakusa watching him intently. It\u2019s even more humiliating to bend over like this but for some horrible reason it makes Atsumu\u2019s dick twitch where it\u2019s filling up against his thigh. He stares at the familiar pattern of Sakusa\u2019s quilt and waits, tension building in his back and shoulders as he braces himself on his elbows.</p>\n<p>Atsumu jumps when he feels Sakusa\u2019s gloved hand slide down his back, thumb rubbing at the divots of his spine. He hears the pump of the lube bottle and tenses even more in anticipation.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Sakusa whispers.</p>\n<p>How the fuck is Atsumu supposed to do that when he knows what the next hour holds? He tries to do as Sakusa says, though, and spreads his legs a little wider as he exhales slowly.</p>\n<p>The first touch of Sakusa\u2019s slick fingers forces a small noise from his throat. Sakusa shushes him and strokes over his lower back with his dry hand. Atsumu tightens his grip on the quilt, trying desperately to keep the rest of his body relaxed as Sakusa circles his hole slowly, getting him wet.</p>\n<p>Then Sakusa finally slides one finger inside, twisting it on the way out and pushing back in with two. Atsumu groans and widens his stance further, shameless, biting his lip as Sakusa thrusts in and out in a slow rhythm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder if I could edge you for an hour without touching your dick at all,\u201d Sakusa says. Atsumu moans and buries his face in the quilt. \u201cI probably could. Maybe we can try that another time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> No </em>\u2026\u201d Atsumu whines, cock jumping traitorously at the thought.</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s free hand leaves his back to come cracking down on his ass, hard. Atsumu jumps, clenching down on Sakusa\u2019s fingers and barely suppressing a yelp. It had been taking Atsumu a second to slip into his usual headspace without the ritual act of being restrained, but the sudden sting on his skin sure gets him there in a hurry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you telling me what to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu shakes his head furiously, heart racing as pain throbs underneath his skin. <em> Fuck. </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa makes an amused sound. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> You like me mean. </em> Atsumu shuts his eyes tight and tries to stay calm, tries to keep his breathing even and slow his heart rate. He <em> hates </em>that Sakusa is right, hates even more that Sakusa knows it, too.</p>\n<p>Sakusa squeezes in a third finger with a little squelching noise, Atsumu\u2019s gut twisting with heat at the slight pain from the stretch. He alternates between spreading and curling his fingers, sending Atsumu up onto his toes at one point when he presses firmly against his prostate.</p>\n<p>\u201cNnngh,\u201d Atsumu groans, starting to rock back into Sakusa\u2019s thrusts. \u201cOh <em> god\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> Smack! </em>Sakusa\u2019s hand comes down on his ass again. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu grunts and tries his best to hold still. Part of him wants to disobey just so Sakusa will hit him again. Those wicked fingers are relentless, probing and pressing deep inside as Atsumu\u2019s knees wobble.</p>\n<p>Then Sakusa pulls out and Atsumu can\u2019t quite suppress the noise he makes at the loss.</p>\n<p>Sakusa makes a derisive noise. \u201cYou\u2019re about to get an <em> hour </em> of this, Atsumu. Don\u2019t be greedy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu feels the blunt press of the plug at his entrance before he can reply. He shifts on his feet, cock swaying between his legs as he bites his lip in anticipation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi\u2026 ungh, <em> fuck-\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cShh, there you go,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, wiggling the base of the plug where it now sits snug between Atsumu\u2019s cheeks. Atsumu moans as it moves inside him, heavy and thick; he barely bites down a yelp when Sakusa reaches around and swipes his fingers over the head of his cock. \u201cOh, you\u2019re dripping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu lets his head drop to the bed, reminding himself at all times to stay motionless even as Sakusa starts up a rhythm, gripping tight as he works Atsumu\u2019s dick in his hand. It\u2019s much harder to stay calm when a portion of Atsumu\u2019s thoughts have to be devoted to keeping still; when he\u2019s tied up, he doesn\u2019t have to think about that at all. It\u2019s not something he has to worry about.</p>\n<p>Now, though, so much of his effort is going toward controlling his body\u2019s <em> movements </em> that there\u2019s a lot less effort to spend on controlling his body\u2019s <em> reactions. </em>Atsumu can\u2019t stop the heat that builds and builds between his legs, burning hotter every time he has to force himself not to hump into Sakusa\u2019s slick grip. The plug makes everything worse, hard and unyielding when he clenches involuntarily around it.</p>\n<p>With Sakusa behind him like this, jerking him off and teasing his prostate with the plug every time he wiggles it with his fingers, Atsumu can almost imagine what it would be like if he\u2026 if they\u2026</p>\n<p>Oh <em> god. </em>Fuck, would Atsumu even be able to stay standing? He tightens his grip on the quilt and moans, shaking with the effort of holding still. He glances up at the clock, then realizes he doesn\u2019t know when they started. It has to have been at least ten minutes, if not more.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi\u2026 O-Omi\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s mouth drops open and he groans when Sakusa starts to rock the heel of his hand against the plug. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 <em> fuck\u2026 </em>how long\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you already, Atsumu. I want you to hold it for an hour today.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cUnnnh, </em>no, I\u2014how long\u2019s\u2019it b\u2019n\u2026\u201d Atsumu\u2019s already starting to slur. He can\u2019t help it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa twists his wrist just right and Atsumu\u2019s eyes roll back. \u201cOh. It\u2019s been about three minutes, I think. Maybe four.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOhgodfuck\u2014\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cShh.\u201d Sakusa rubs his thumb right underneath the crown and Atsumu\u2019s hips tremble from how badly he wants to shove them back. \u201cOh, you are <em> easy </em>today. Are you going to be good and tell me when you\u2019re close?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu is helpless to do anything but nod.</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be more than another few minutes before Sakusa\u2019s got him perilously close to the edge. Atsumu\u2019s teeth are sunk so hard into his bottom lip he thinks he tastes blood; he briefly contemplates staying quiet and letting Sakusa push him right off that delicious cliff. Whatever punishment Sakusa dreams up afterward will just be a bonus, because Atsumu\u2019s wires are apparently crossed like that.</p>\n<p>But his overwhelming desire to be <em> good, </em>to leave Sakusa impressed enough to shower him with praise, to stay in Sakusa\u2019s thoughts afterward and be the best goddamn sub he\u2019s ever had\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi,\u201d Atsumu gasps. A warning.</p>\n<p>Sakusa makes a noise of acknowledgement, but the hand on Atsumu\u2019s dick doesn\u2019t stop moving, slipping over him sloppy and wet. Atsumu\u2019s eyes pop open and he grunts, grabbing fistfuls of the quilt as he tries to hold back.</p>\n<p>\u201cClose\u2014<em> pleasem\u2019close\u2014\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa hums happily and lets go, leaving Atsumu a breath away from orgasm. He keens, nearly tipping over all by himself as his body ripples around the plug, spasming with his denied release. Sakusa rubs over Atsumu\u2019s hip with his clean hand and makes another happy noise as Atsumu\u2019s knees threaten to buckle inwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe\u2026 good.\u201d Atsumu glances up at the clock and moans sadly when he realizes that only seven minutes have passed since they started. \u201cNow get up on the bed when you\u2019re able to move again.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes a moment to make sure his body\u2019s calmed down before crawling onto the bed, looking over his shoulder when Sakusa doesn\u2019t say anything else only to find himself paralyzed by a dark, heated gaze as Sakusa strips off his gloves.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sit against the headboard,\u201d Sakusa says, adjusting his rolled-up sleeves as he gets onto the bed. Atsumu sits back on his heels, blushing all the way to the tips of his ears at the way his dick is standing up straight, begging for attention. \u201cYou can lean back against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu gulps. They\u2019ve sat like this a couple times before\u2014Atsumu\u2019s back against Sakusa\u2019s chest, legs spread\u2014and each time the feeling of Sakusa\u2019s dick pressing against the small of his back has left Atsumu\u2019s head spinning. He gets a brief, bizarre urge to cover himself, followed by an even more bizarre urge to climb into Sakusa\u2019s lap <em> facing him, </em>to lean down and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Sakusa\u2019s voice snaps Atsumu out of his daydream.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s\u2014fuck, he\u2019s patting his lap, looking at Atsumu expectantly, oblivious to what\u2019s going on in Atsumu\u2019s head. Atsumu takes a deep breath and makes his way over, turning around and shimmying back against him as he hisses at what that does to the plug inside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019not a dog, ya know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Sakusa sounds amused. \u201cBut you come when you\u2019re told.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s face flames and he feels his heartbeat pulse in his dick. Shit, he walked right into that one. He crosses his arms over his chest, digging his nails into his own skin as Sakusa reaches over to the nightstand and grabs another pair of gloves.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to keep your hands at your sides for this,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, pulling on the gloves before reaching back for a few pumps of lube. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter exactly where, as long as you stay still. Just don\u2019t interfere with what I\u2019m doing and don\u2019t try to cover yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d Atsumu stammers.</p>\n<p>It takes considerable effort for him to move his hands away from his chest, leaving himself completely exposed as he tries to relax his shoulders and let his arms settle at his sides. Then Sakusa reaches underneath his arms as he gets ready to start and Atsumu is forced to readjust his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nearly snatches them away when they land on Sakusa\u2019s thighs, firm and strong underneath the expensive fabric of his slacks, but Sakusa doesn\u2019t react beyond a sharp intake of breath. He doesn\u2019t make any effort to move Atsumu\u2019s hands, either.</p>\n<p>Then Sakusa takes hold of his cock with both hands and Atsumu stops worrying about the position of his own.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOmi\u2026\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Sakusa drops one hand down to play with his balls, getting them sticky as he jerks him slow and steady. \u201cThere you go, Atsumu. Relax a little more.\u201d</p>\n<p>How the fuck is Atsumu supposed to do that? He grunts and rolls his shoulders, trying to let all of his muscles loosen further, trying to keep his grip on Sakusa\u2019s thighs loose even when Sakusa circles a thumb around the slit at the head of his cock. Fuck. Fuck fuck <em> fuck. </em>This is so much more difficult than being restrained.</p>\n<p>Concentration split once more, Atsumu finds himself approaching the edge all too soon. He moans and tips his head back onto Sakusa\u2019s shoulder, trying his very best to hold off, but Sakusa catches on and grips him tighter, twisting both wrists as he works him faster. Atsumu\u2019s hands twitch on Sakusa\u2019s thighs, toes curling.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuuuck\u2026\u201d Atsumu\u2019s knees turn inward and he has to fight to keep his legs open. \u201cOh <em> god.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa hums. \u201cAre you close?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t want him to stop. He\u2019s not at that knife\u2019s edge yet, the one that makes him shiver all over as his brain goes fuzzy. \u201cNot\u2026 yet\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are such a masochist,\u201d Sakusa chuckles, mask brushing the shell of his ear. \u201cI\u2019m lucky you\u2019re not disobedient often, you know. It would be hard to come up with many punishments you wouldn\u2019t enjoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>His words hit Atsumu hard, body throbbing around the plug as his cock twitches in Sakusa\u2019s hands, approaching the point of no return.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit\u2014<em>Omi, </em>I\u2014m\u2019gonna\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa takes his hands away.</p>\n<p>Atsumu cries out, needy, the toy inside him once again nearly pushing him right over the edge. His unrestrained hands dart between his legs on instinct but Sakusa catches his wrists like he\u2019s expecting it. Atsumu gasps and fights against the urge to struggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck\u2014sorry, sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, gently lowering Atsumu\u2019s hands back to his thighs. \u201cIt\u2019s a new level of control, I know. You\u2019re still learning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s dick is pulsing in time with his heart as he tries to steady his breathing. \u201cI\u2019ll do better, Omi, I promise\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, I know you will... so good for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu moans at the praise, squirming as Sakusa\u2019s hands skate up his front to play with his nipples, pinching and pulling as Atsumu digs his heels into the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2014<em> fuck\u2014 </em> he can do this. A quick glance at the clock shows that it\u2019s been twelve minutes since they started. Almost a quarter of the way there and Sakusa\u2019s only brought him to the edge twice. <em> Atsumu can do this. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu can\u2019t do this.</p>\n<p>His knuckles are white where he\u2019s clinging to Sakusa\u2019s thighs, afraid if he lets go he won\u2019t be able to stop from touching himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease\u2026 <em> please\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cFifteen more minutes, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, one hand drifting down to tug on his swollen balls. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sobs. <em> \u201cUuunnnghh\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to make it. His cock is impossibly hard, so dark with blood it\u2019s bordering on purple, glossy with lube and the nearly steady stream of precome that\u2019s leaking out of the fat tip. His balls are tight, sore with denied release, and his hole keeps squeezing around the toy inside him. It feels like all of the blood in Atsumu\u2019s body has settled between his legs, leaving him dizzy and lightheaded.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s fully under\u2014holding himself still requires too much willpower for his mind to be able to completely slip away\u2014but he feels drunk, a few tears slipping down his cheeks. Edging has never been this intense before.</p>\n<p>He clutches Sakusa\u2019s thighs even tighter when Sakusa rubs the palm of his hand over the head. <em> \u201cNnnnh\u2014 </em>Omi\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa takes that for the warning that it is and removes his hands. Atsumu wails at the absence of his touch, head dropping back on Sakusa\u2019s shoulder as tears stream down his face. Looking at himself\u2014at what Sakusa\u2019s done to him\u2014would just make it harder to hold back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Sakusa murmurs.</p>\n<p>Atsumu bites his lip and whines. His hips jerk away when Sakusa runs one teasing finger down his shaft, maddeningly light; he ends up pushing his ass back into the cradle of Sakusa\u2019s hips, moaning when he feels how hard Sakusa is. Atsumu thinks about how good that would feel inside him and his hole clenches down involuntarily on the plug, back arching as he rubs mindlessly against Sakusa\u2019s stiff length.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels like the most natural thing in the world to him, so he doesn\u2019t think anything of it until he hears Sakusa\u2019s sharp intake of breath and notices that Sakusa\u2019s hands have paused in their movements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu feels like he\u2019s resurfacing from a pool as he realizes what he\u2019s doing and who he\u2019s doing it with. He stops moving completely and tries to remember how to formulate a sentence, blinking the tears out of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi, I\u2014shit, m\u2019sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh,\u201d Sakusa shushes him, rubbing over his thighs. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Atsumu. You can keep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just like that, Atsumu feels himself slipping back into his comfortable headspace. He makes a noise that is absolutely not a whimper and tries to remember why grinding on Sakusa was a bad idea in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can move however you want,\u201d Sakusa continues, hooking his chin over Atsumu\u2019s shoulder. Atsumu\u2019s breath freezes in his chest. \u201cJust let me play, and don\u2019t touch yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Atsumu groans, plunging back into the place where nothing matters except for him and Sakusa, where nothing exists outside of the four walls of Sakusa\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He braces himself on Sakusa\u2019s thighs and rocks back, pushing his ass right up against Sakusa\u2019s cock. Sakusa makes a low noise and puts his hands back where Atsumu wants them, fingers slipping over Atsumu\u2019s tortured cock as he lets Atsumu grind on him. He keeps his chin on Atsumu\u2019s shoulder, peering down the length of his body like it\u2019s his due. Atsumu loves it.</p>\n<p><em> Fuck, </em>he wants that cock inside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so close to making it,\u201d Sakusa murmurs. \u201cI know you can do it, Atsumu. You\u2019ve been so good for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sobs, a single tear sliding down one of the tracks on his cheek. \u201cM\u2019good?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shudders as Sakusa wraps a hand around him and strokes him more firmly.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cSo </em>good. Once we get to an hour, I\u2019ll make you come however you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu moans loudly. He wants to come on Sakusa\u2019s <em> dick. </em>The idea won\u2019t leave his head, clinging stubbornly as Atsumu tries to imagine this ending any other way than Sakusa fucking him into the mattress.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cClose\u2014\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Now that they\u2019ve almost reached an hour and he knows he\u2019ll be able to come soon, Atsumu\u2019s starting to relish each denial. He moans when Sakusa takes his hands away, moans at the release trapped in his pelvis with nowhere to go, moans at the soreness in his balls.</p>\n<p>More tears slip from Atsumu\u2019s eyes and he groans from deep in his chest when Sakusa begins pinching his nipples once more, keeping him close to the edge. Atsumu\u2019s limbs are starting to feel heavy; it\u2019s getting easier to keep still, like resting limp against Sakusa\u2019s chest and letting his dom play to his heart\u2019s content is exactly where he\u2019s supposed to be.</p>\n<p>If only he was sitting on Sakusa\u2019s cock while they were doing this.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmiii\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Fuck me. Want me. Use me. Please, please fuck me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d Sakusa murmurs, rolling his nipples between cruel fingers. \u201cWe only have a few minutes. Can you give me one more?\u201d</p>\n<p>Right now, Atsumu would give Sakusa <em> anything </em>. He nods quickly, rolling his hips and savoring the little noise he pulls from Sakusa\u2019s lips. His movements are shoving the plug against his prostate, rhythmic and teasing\u2014it\u2019s good but it\u2019s not deep enough, he wants\u2014he wishes Sakusa would\u2014</p>\n<p>Just one touch of his horribly sensitive cock is nearly enough to make Atsumu come. He cries out hoarsely and tenses up all over as he braces himself against the tide of orgasm, tries to hold on a little longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Sakusa whispers.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cCan\u2019t\u2026\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>If Atsumu relaxes any of his muscles, including his diaphragm, he\u2019s afraid he might not be able to stop himself from coming.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Sakusa keeps one hand on his cock, but brings the other up to rest at the base of his throat. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu shakes his head. His eyes fly open and he digs his nails into Sakusa\u2019s thighs when the hand circles his neck<em> . </em>Sakusa still hasn\u2019t let up on his cock, but for the moment Atsumu\u2019s attention is diverted.</p>\n<p>Then Sakusa tightens his grip on Atsumu\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat about now?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Atsumu can\u2019t help but gasp, he realizes that he <em> can </em>still breathe, even though it\u2019s difficult. Sakusa\u2019s fingers are pressing more into the sides of his neck, not the front, and it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026</p>\n<p>It\u2019s making his head even fuzzier. Atsumu blinks. He might be going a little cross-eyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. If you can speak, you can breathe,\u201d Sakusa says, and squeezes him even tighter.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMngh\u2014\u201d </em> Atsumu squirms, chest heaving as he sucks in any air he can, trying to clear his head. His ears are ringing, nearly blocking out the wet sounds of Sakusa\u2019s hand slipping over the head of his cock. He can feel his heartbeat pulsing against Sakusa\u2019s fingers from how hard they\u2019re pressing into his neck. \u201cOhh\u2014 <em> hah, g\u2019na\u2014\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa lets go of his dick, but not his throat. Atsumu\u2019s howl is muted, partially caught in his lungs as he squirms and curls his toes into the quilt, hands twitching as he tries desperately not to reach for himself. Then Sakusa relaxes the grip little by little and Atsumu\u2019s eyes widen as oxygen slowly returns to his brain. It\u2019s a <em> rush\u2014 </em>if this feeling had hit him all at once it would have sent him over the edge. Atsumu shivers and whines before the thought seizes him.</p>\n<p><em> The edge. </em>Sakusa had asked for one more. Atsumu just gave it to him. Does that mean\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did it, Atsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s voice is proud, yet strained. Atsumu\u2019s eyes prickle. New tears start to spill down half-dry tracks; he\u2019s overwhelmed. He also realizes he hasn\u2019t quite stopped grinding back against the firm bulge in Sakusa\u2019s slacks, and he doesn\u2019t <em> want </em> to stop. After everything Sakusa\u2019s given him, Atsumu\u2019s throat clogs up with the desperate desire to ask for <em> more </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Fuck me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gave me so much, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa continues, rubbing over Atsumu\u2019s sweaty thighs. \u201cHow do you want to come?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too much. His dick hurts and his skin feels like it\u2019s about to split apart with the desire saturating his body. A sob cracks from Atsumu\u2019s bitten lips. He can\u2019t think\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to\u2014he just wants Sakusa\u2014</p>\n<p>There\u2019s movement behind him and Atsumu whines brokenly as Sakusa slides out from behind him. Gloved hands lay him back against the pillows; then there\u2019s a bare palm against his cheek, fingers tilting his face upwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d Sakusa says, and Atsumu does. His image swims into view, black hair, black mask... deep, deep black eyes. \u201cYou earned this, Atsumu. You did so good. Tell me how you want to come, you can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Sakusa hadn\u2019t just spent an hour making Atsumu\u2019s brain melt out of his ears, Atsumu would have the self-restraint not to say what he says next. But Atsumu has been stripped down so deeply there\u2019s nothing that could hold in the truth when Sakusa asks for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p>He presses his cheek into Sakusa\u2019s palm, eyelids so heavy, but open for him. Atsumu\u2019s unfocused, clouded gaze trained right up at him. The slurred words slip out, not to be taken back.</p>\n<p>\u201cInside me\u2014wanna come with\u2019ya inside me, <em> Omi </em>...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Inside me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi is stunned.</p>\n<p>Well, part of him is. The other part knows they\u2019ve been building toward this for months, even if Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t want to admit it. Knows that everything has been progressing toward one inevitable conclusion: Kiyoomi painfully hard in his slacks and braced over a debauched Atsumu who\u2019s begging to be fucked.</p>\n<p>His golden eyes are glistening with tears, so open and trusting it takes Kiyoomi\u2019s breath away. His cheek is warm against Kiyoomi\u2019s bare palm; Kiyoomi took his gloves off to be considerate, so he wouldn\u2019t smear leftover lube on Atsumu\u2019s face, but now it means that every touch is skin-on-skin, his nerve endings blistering at the contact. He\u2019s losing the battle with the desire coursing through his body.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi blinks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes slide down to Atsumu\u2019s mouth, red and wet and open as he pants desperately. He wonders if he\u2019ll ever get tired of reducing Miya Atsumu to <em> this.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He thumbs over Atsumu\u2019s bottom lip and Atsumu moans, closing his lips around Kiyoomi\u2019s bare thumb and sucking gently.</p>\n<p>The last tether of Kiyoomi\u2019s restraint snaps.</p>\n<p>He tugs his mask down and nearly lunges for the man beneath him, pulling his thumb out of Atsumu\u2019s mouth and pressing their lips together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s mouth is soft, wet and lax, lips parting in a surprised gasp that Kiyoomi takes advantage of by pressing his tongue inside. Atsumu moans, the sound vibrating in Kiyoomi\u2019s head over the slick noises of their lips meeting, then wraps his arms around Kiyoomi\u2019s back before yanking them away a second later like he\u2019s been burned.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi pulls back reluctantly to check on him, lips already tingling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Atsumu gasps, eyes locked on Kiyoomi\u2019s mouth as he twists the quilt in both fists. \u201cForgot I<em>\u2014</em>wasn\u2019t s\u2019posed\u2019ta touch\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi already misses the feeling of Atsumu\u2019s lips on his own. He dips down to kiss him again while he considers Atsumu\u2019s strangely considerate statement. How much <em> does </em>he want Atsumu to touch him? Usually Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t enjoy or allow much contact from subs, but his body didn\u2019t bristle at all when Atsumu clung to him a second ago.</p>\n<p>He ultimately decides to allow it for now but keep Atsumu on a short leash, desperately trying to hold onto any semblance of control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can touch my back and hips, but if I tell you to stop, put your hands over your head right away, okay?\u201d Kiyoomi rasps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyes widen and he nods, hands coming to hover over Kiyoomi\u2019s sides like he\u2019s still not sure if he\u2019s allowed. Kiyoomi reaches up to take his mask off completely, unlooping it from his ears and throwing it to the side before he leans in for another kiss and climbs over to cover Atsumu\u2019s body completely with his own. He twists his fingers into Atsumu\u2019s hair tightly, tilting his head back as he licks into Atsumu\u2019s mouth and feels hands slide up his back, kneading at the fabric of his shirt before curling over his shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>The kiss is embarrassingly frantic, especially when Kiyoomi lowers some of his weight down and gets a little shock of pleasure as his dick presses against Atsumu\u2019s through the barrier of his clothing. Atsumu gasps and squirms, trying to wriggle away, but there\u2019s nowhere for him to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet\u2026 <em> not yet\u2026\u201d </em> he keeps mumbling against Kiyoomi\u2019s lips. \u201cPlease not yet\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi grinds down just to push him and shudders at the way he whines, at the delicious pressure between his legs. Atsumu has been edged for an hour, edged to the point of <em> tears, </em> but he <em> still </em> wants to wait until he can come on Kiyoomi\u2019s cock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never been with anyone like Atsumu. It\u2019s making parts of Kiyoomi\u2019s brain shut down one by one until all that\u2019s left is instinct, base and feral.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi swears against Atsumu\u2019s lips and sits up, feverishly undoing his pants. Atsumu\u2019s still reaching out for him, needy and wrecked, cock drooling onto his belly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, look at you,\u201d Kiyoomi mutters.</p>\n<p>He frees his dick, core pulsing with heat as he strokes himself. He feels manic. Atsumu\u2019s eyes slide down his body and widen, mouth dropping open a little.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOmi.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi leans down to nip at his throat before reaching over to the bedside table to fish around for a condom. He isn\u2019t in the practice of having unanticipated sexual partners, but he always keeps some just in case. He finds one towards the back after nearly knocking his lamp off the table.</p>\n<p>He rears back and rips the foil packet open without preamble, feeling like he\u2019s in a dream as he slides it down his cock. He breathes harshly as he gazes down the fucked-up look on Atsumu\u2019s face. He\u2019s a mess, a <em> wreck </em> , and Kiyoomi did this to him. It\u2019s <em> obscene.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Sitting back on his heels, it\u2019s easy to push one of Atsumu\u2019s thighs up towards his chest and grip the base of the plug, pulling it out in one smooth movement. Atsumu shouts, spine contorting, and then whines low and forlorn as he drops his head back against the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi\u2026 <em> please\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s <em> it.</em>\u00a0Kiyoomi curses, rocks forward onto his knees to line himself up with a shaking hand, and <em> thrusts </em> deep into Atsumu\u2019s body<em>. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi fills him up with one powerful snap of his hips, slapping against his spanked-pink ass when he bottoms out, and Atsumu <em> screams</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck, it feels so good to have tight heat around his cock like this after so long without. Kiyoomi can\u2019t believe he waited this long. He draws back and thrusts in again, leaning down to catch Atsumu\u2019s bottom lip in his teeth as Atsumu arches up and moans into his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi pushes forward, bending Atsumu\u2019s lower half upward so he can kiss him more comfortably, his leg hooked into the crook of Sakusa\u2019s elbow. The angle leaves Atsumu exposed, unable to even move his own hips<em>\u2014</em>he just has to take it. To let Kiyoomi take everything from him, leaving only ecstasy in his wake <em> .\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>And Kiyoomi <em> takes, </em>pleasure ripping up and down his spine from every grunt, every groan. He goes to take Atsumu\u2019s pleasure too, wrapping his free hand around his abused cock.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no<em>\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kiyoomi pants, catching Atsumu\u2019s lip between his teeth as a wicked smile steals unbidden onto his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me touching you? I thought you wanted to come with me inside you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words, with a well-timed thrust of Kiyoomi\u2019s hips, drive a guttural sound from Atsumu\u2019s throat. He shakes his head, whole body shuddering when Kiyoomi grinds his cock deep. Kiyoomi darts briefly into his mouth, smiling when Atsumu sucks weakly on his tongue, then pulls back just to watch Atsumu chase his lips. He feels completely drunk on power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna<em>\u2014</em>want\u2019ya ta\u2026 first\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Shit. </em> Kiyoomi has to bite his own lip to stop a moan from ripping loose deep inside his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to come first, Atsumu? Is that it? You want to make me come?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods, eyelids fluttering. \u201cFr\u2019you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi does groan this time, into the line of Atsumu\u2019s jaw as his lips glide over his skin. What a good sub.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. All for me. Just want to be my little fucktoy, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kiyoomi whispers into Atsumu\u2019s ear, clenching his teeth as Atsumu\u2019s body pulses around him in response to his words. \u201cBut I want to feel you, Atsumu. I want to feel you go over the edge I\u2019ve been dangling you from. I want to watch you fall. Can you do that for me, Atsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cOmi-i-i,\u201d </em> Atsumu sobs, and that\u2019s enough of an answer for Kiyoomi to start moving his hand, firm strokes of his dick matching the movements of his hips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t hold back, not when Atsumu\u2019s sounds take on that panicked note they always do when he\u2019s about to go over at the end of an edging session, betraying a wave of oncoming pleasure so powerful it must be terrifying. Arms tighten around Kiyoomi\u2019s back even as he forces some distance between them so that he can <em> see </em>, so he can watch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi keeps his eyes open even as his own pleasure mounts, clocking every delicious little change in Atsumu\u2019s expression. He gasps when one of Atsumu\u2019s hands, by accident or otherwise, slides high enough that Kiyoomi can feel the pads of his fingers pressed against the nape of his neck, as if Atsumu would literally fall without holding on to him. Atsumu\u2019s other hand drifts away from Kiyoomi\u2019s back and ends up clenched in the quilt above his head, like he\u2019s bracing himself uselessly against the onslaught. Kiyoomi waits and keeps moving, desperate and overcome, until he feels Atsumu\u2019s cock get impossibly harder in his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he hovers, just over his face, and commands, <em> \u201cCome, Atsumu. </em>Come for me, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound that Atsumu makes and the way his body ripples around Kiyoomi\u2019s dick is going to haunt his dreams. Atsumu comes, the high angle of his hips splashing white all the way up to his chin as he spills and spills. Even from Kiyoomi\u2019s point of view it feels like it goes on forever as he fucks Atsumu through it, feeling him rhythmically clench around him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,<em> shit</em>,\u201d Kiyoomi breathes, suddenly hurdling over the edge. He presses his forehead to Atsumu\u2019s as he shoots into the condom, and time seems to freeze for a moment as overwhelming heat washes through his body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Kiyoomi comes back to himself, the first thing he thinks is <em> I didn\u2019t plan for that to happen </em>. The second thing that comes to mind is that he needs to make sure Atsumu\u2019s alright, even though he\u2019s becoming increasingly aware of the sweat between his clothes and skin, how some of Atsumu\u2019s come has smeared across his shirt. He holds back a face as he quickly ties the condom off, disposes of it, and checks in on Atsumu.</p>\n<p>His eyes are nearly closed, but not completely, and the slit of them that\u2019s visible looks blown out and unfocused. It seems like the end of their session may have put him under.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Kiyoomi whispers, pushing his hair back. All he gets is a hum in response as Atsumu\u2019s eyes close fully, a smile breaking out on his face. It makes a smile bloom on Kiyoomi\u2019s lips as well. \u201cYou did amazingly. That was so good, Atsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi wipes him down with a wipe pulled from the bedside table, not wanting to leave even to get a washcloth. He turns Atsumu onto his side and grabs the blanket to tuck it around him, then rubs a hand up and down from Atsumu\u2019s shoulder to his hip through the fabric. Still, it\u2019s only a few moments before Atsumu starts to shiver.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi hums. It\u2019s not rare for a sub to have trouble thermoregulating after a long, intense scene.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu, can you hear me,\u201d Kiyoomi asks, only to be met with the thinnest of slits of foggy hazel. \u201cYou look a little cold. Let's get you into a bath.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu tries to work with him as Kiyoomi attempts to get him up, but he nearly pitches right off the bed, which brings another half grin to Kiyoomi\u2019s face. He\u2019s really out of it. It\u2019s\u2026 kind of endearing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a mental shrug and a thank you to his weight training routine, Kiyoomi solves their problem by scooping Atsumu up, blanket and all. It\u2019s not easy, lifting over 80 kilograms of professional athlete, but Kiyoomi manages with an arm under his knees and one around his shoulders, a modified bridal carry.</p>\n<p>Atsumu slurs something that sounds like <em> woah Omi </em>, and Kiyoomi walks them towards the bathroom with a good natured, \u201cDon\u2019t get used to this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t remember anything with much clarity before the fourth set of the Kanagawa match. He vaguely remembers Sakusa carrying him into the bathroom and sitting him down on the shower stool to rinse him off before putting him into a hot bath. He remembers Sakusa showering as Atsumu soaked a few feet away, content as could be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things got a little clearer when Sakusa got him up, dressed, and led him down the hallway to the couch, but then it faded out again for a while. Safe on the sofa, wrapped in fleece, with the sounds of volleyball in the background, Atsumu happily went back to drifting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oddly the first thing that\u2019s clear is a single serve whistle at the start of the fourth. Atsumu feels more like himself. He\u2019s fully aware of Sakusa on the other end of the couch, scrolling through his phone between plays.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A slow, menacing smile blooms across Atsumu\u2019s face as he stares at Sakusa. Sakusa, who kissed him. Sakusa, who <em> fucked </em> him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a second Sakusa glances up and his brow flattens as he notices the expression on Atsumu\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re back,\u201d he says. \u201cHow are you feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>The grin grows even wider as Atsumu realizes Sakusa is going to play this off like a tomcat that just fell off a wall, pretending everyone didn\u2019t see and that he has nothing to be embarrassed about. And fall he did. No matter what Sakusa tries to play off now, Atsumu knows that he didn\u2019t go into that scene planning to fuck Atsumu. Sure, Atsumu asked him to\u2026 but he followed through, <em> enthusiastically.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling <em> great</em>, Omi-Omi,\u201d Atsumu says and Sakusa just rolls his eyes and pushes himself up off the couch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hungry? I'll warm up the curries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, <em> Omi-kun</em>,\u201d Atsumu drawls, smirking up at Sakusa as he walks by.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It earns him half the fleece blanket flipped over his head, but Atsumu considers Sakusa not trying to straight up suffocate him for that as a sign of affection, so. He giggles as he pushes it down, following Sakusa to the kitchen with his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are <em> you </em> feelin\u2019?\u201d Atsumu asks, lounging against the cushions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, thanks,\u201d he says, hilariously dismissive, as he opens up the fridge. \u201cI was actually thinking... you should re-do your list. You had a lot of things marked as unsure or curious\u2026 things we both now know you <em> deeply </em> enjoy. It would be helpful going forward for you to fill out a new version, now that you\u2019re more\u2026 experienced.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu flushes at the dark heat in Sakusa\u2019s eyes. He knows it was an extremely successful pivot away from Atsumu\u2019s smug teasing, but it\u2019s more than that, too. It\u2019s a sign, from Sakusa to Atsumu, that there\u2019s more to come. If he had any fear that having sex would make Sakusa distance himself, it disappears at those simple words. This is just the beginning.</p>\n<p>Atsumu swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yes\u2026 sounds good, Omi-kun.\u201d</p>"
