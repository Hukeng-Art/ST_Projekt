  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had been mulling over revealing himself mid-fight, dramatically whipping off his helmet with a hateful sneer, or revealing himself at the end, when he slammed a heavy boot into broken fingers to let his narrowed eyes be the last thing his replacement saw, but he\u2019d eventually decided to bare his face from the start.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Come out swinging like a vengeful wraith and watch as the kid shit himself in terror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stepped out of the shadows with a deliberate scuff of his boots and leaned against the wall, waiting.\u00a0 He knew that the darkness turned his eyes into a poisonous shade of green, and judging by Timothy Drake\u2019s wide, wide eyes, the effect was as frightening as he\u2019d intended.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason,\u201d the kid breathed out.\u00a0 The wide eyes made him look\u2026young.\u00a0 Especially since he was out of uniform, dressed in light exercise wear for an insomnia-triggered midnight workout.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had a whole plan.\u00a0 A speech with words as sharp as knives, every one carefully calculated to <em>hurt</em>, to poison with hate and fury and <em>how-dare-you-take-what\u2019s-mine</em>.\u00a0 He opened his mouth to deliver it, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid said his name with something approaching awe.\u00a0 Reverence.\u00a0 The hate that Jason usually carried in a broken shard of his heart was suddenly nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTimothy Jackson Drake,\u201d Jason started slowly.\u00a0 The kid didn\u2019t look surprised to hear his name.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t made a single move to approach Jason or call for backup or in any way question the presence of a stranger in what was supposed to be a fortified base.\u00a0 He was frozen in place, his face stuck somewhere between hope and heartbreak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid almost swayed when he was finally forced to blink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should get some sleep,\u201d Jason said automatically.\u00a0 The kid frowned.\u00a0 Jason\u2019s mouth was suddenly dry\u2014where the <em>hell</em> had that come from?\u2014and he edged a step back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid blinked again, slow and sticky, and Jason took the opportunity to duck back into the shadows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so that hadn\u2019t gone according to plan.\u00a0 And yeah, Jason had fled like he was a twelve-year-old clutching a tire iron, but in his defense, it was a bit difficult to be intimidating after nagging someone to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason knew that from personal experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But hopefully the kid was sleep-deprived enough to dismiss the whole thing as some strange waking dream and Jason had the chance to try again.\u00a0 This time, he was aiming for the post-battle adrenaline crash\u2014the team would be on their last legs, the Replacement would be exhausted, and he could add the tinge of helplessness to the beat-down he was going to deliver.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason shifted in his perch on the rooftop, watching as the Replacement forced five of the alien-robot things into an alley before deploying an EMP as they twittered and shrieked.\u00a0 The kid turned back to the main fight as soon as the creatures started crumpling, unaware that the EMP hadn\u2019t been as effective as he\u2019d planned and that the creatures were raising their weapons and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBehind you!\u201d Jason shouted instinctively, and Robin whirled around, registering the weapons and firing another EMP.\u00a0 The creatures finally crumpled to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin raised his head and stared straight at Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason was frozen to the spot, unable to move, as the kid stared up at him\u2014\u201cRobin!\u201d one of his teammates called, and the kid finally turned away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason let out a breath and buried his head in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was not working out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time, Jason had the perfect plan.\u00a0 A foolproof way to both bypass his apparently instinctive reaction to the sight of a Robin in trouble, and his Alfred-trained response to dark circles.\u00a0 He\u2019d just catch the kid while he was sleeping, and finally be able to deliver his hateful speech without undercutting his message by telling the kid to eat his vegetables or something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had never had this problem before.\u00a0 He\u2019d killed lots of people without the urge to make sure they were drinking eight glasses of water and not substituting caffeine for liquids.\u00a0 This was just another thing to add to the Replacement\u2019s long list of crimes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The security at the Tower was just as laughable as the last time, and the door swung open soundlessly when Jason nudged it and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim startled up like he\u2019d been shocked, head snapping away from his laptop to squint blearily at the intruder in his room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason?\u201d he asked hoarsely, but Jason cut him off, furious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a concussion!\u201d he seethed, because he\u2019d watched their fight against the Mindless Army of the Month and Tim had definitely slammed into a wall head-first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are supposed to be <em>sleeping</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just had some work\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jason snapped, \u201cI don\u2019t care how much work you have.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care how critical it is.\u00a0 You are getting into bed <em>right now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim blinked at him, slow and confused.\u00a0 He reached out a hand towards Jason but hesitated halfway, fingers curling before the hand slowly withdrew.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid the meaning of the word <em>now</em> change since you last heard it, Replacement?\u201d Jason snarled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim flinched back at that, pinching the bridge of his nose and exhaling heavily.\u00a0 \u201cDidn\u2019t think I hit my head hard enough for hallucinations,\u201d the kid mumbled under his breath, but he slowly dragged himself out of the chair, closing the laptop before flopping on top of his bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason drew the line at finding the kid a blanket.\u00a0 He was <em>not</em> tucking him in bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason,\u201d the kid said quietly, half-muffled by his pillow.\u00a0 Jason edged around the room until he was in Tim\u2019s field of view, a sliver of blue visible between mostly closed lids.\u00a0 \u201cI just wanted to make you proud,\u201d he said, voice cracking to something painfully raw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took Jason a full five minutes after the kid\u2019s breathing evened out before he could unfreeze and <em>leave</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the stories about the Pit\u2019s side effects aside, Jason was not actually insane.\u00a0 Once was incidence, but three times was definitely a fucking pattern, and the pattern was telling him that he wouldn\u2019t be able to go after the Replacement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which, okay, Jason could admit that his reasoning for beating up a fifteen-year-old was not all there, and Tim couldn\u2019t really be blamed for taking Jason\u2019s place.\u00a0 What kid wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to be Robin?\u00a0 Jason certainly hadn\u2019t said no.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t Tim\u2019s fault.\u00a0 It was the fault of the guy who\u2019d handed over the suit like the last kid hadn\u2019t <em>died in it</em>, and the fault of the ever-smiling, obnoxiously cheerful asshole that had spent every second making sure Jason knew exactly who he was being compared against and how far he was falling short.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then the Golden Boy had turned around and mentored Tim like he never had a complex over a different kid wearing Robin colors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason was flexible.\u00a0 He could adapt his plans.\u00a0 He could shove his growing, seething, green-laced fury over to a different target, and take a drive to Bludhaven, and track down an apartment address\u2014and gawk, because he thought <em>Gotham</em> was a shithole\u2014and sneak past a pitiful shock-trap on the windowsill, and be leaning against the counter when Dick stumbled in for breakfast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick stopped short on the threshold.\u00a0 Jason smirked\u2014he\u2019d ditched the body armor and weapons for casual clothes, intending to see how many buttons he could push before Dick gave him the fight he wanted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are\u2026two of you,\u201d Dick said, his gaze flitting between Jason and the empty counter to his right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason was abruptly concerned for the state of Dick\u2019s liver.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dick shrugged, shuffling towards the far cabinet, \u201cWhat cereal would you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared blankly at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick reappeared with two boxes of cereal.\u00a0 \u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked, staring straight at Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCheerios,\u201d Jason\u2019s mouth replied.\u00a0 Jason\u2019s brain was still trying to understand what was going on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Dick\u2019s face split into a sad smile.\u00a0 Jason stared silently as Dick walked around the kitchen, careful not to get too close to him or a space near the stove he was avoiding, getting out bowls and milk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He set the table for three people, dumping in his frosty, over-sugared concoction in one bowl, and leaving plain Cheerios in the other two.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a growing pit in Jason\u2019s stomach and it was threatening to undermine the stability of everything he\u2019d built his plans around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick finished his cereal in silence, staring at the two untouched bowls, gaze moving between Jason and the empty spot.\u00a0 When he was done, he took all three bowls to the sink, dumping out the now soggy cereal down the drain and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His knees buckled and Jason nearly lunged to catch him before he stopped himself.\u00a0 Dick was kneeling on the floor, forehead pressed against the counter as he shook, tears dripping down his face as hitched sobs were drowned out by the sound of the water running.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJaybird,\u201d Dick whispered brokenly, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason backed away.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t supposed to see this.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t supposed to be here.\u00a0 He nearly tripped into a wall in his haste to leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason tried to tell himself that he was stalking Dick around the city for information\u2014not that the guy seemed to really notice, ignoring Jason every time he caught sight of him\u2014but the excuse stretched painfully thin by the time Nightwing suited up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hadn\u2019t really thought much of Batman being a lone defender in a city full of criminals, but Batman was <em>Batman</em>.\u00a0 He was larger than life, and he\u2019d been that way for as long as Jason could remember.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing, on the other hand, was painfully overworked and exhausted and seemed to be just one step above punching bag for Bludhaven\u2019s thugs.\u00a0 The quips were landing flat, the flips weren\u2019t as showy as Jason remembered, and Jason nearly freaked out the first time a criminal levelled a gun at Nightwing\u2019s undefended back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason was caught between two options\u2014reveal himself or let Nightwing get shot\u2014and his panicking mind snatched at the first alternate option it saw.\u00a0 Jason nailed the criminal in the face with a stray stone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The criminal yelped, Nightwing turned around, escrima flashing, and the criminal went down soon after.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason collected a small pile of pebbles.\u00a0 By the time Nightwing dropped back on the roof of his apartment building, it was down to two pieces of broken glass and half a brick, and Jason\u2019s blood pressure was through the roof.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Jason couldn\u2019t stop himself from hissing as Nightwing headed for the fire escape, \u201cYou nearly got yourself killed <em>ten times over</em>, you stupid bird, you need someone to watch your back before you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that you\u2019re here for, Jay?\u201d Nightwing laughed.\u00a0 The sound was airy, and Jason didn\u2019t like it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d Jason cut himself off.\u00a0 <em>I\u2019m dead</em>.\u00a0 Only he wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 Dick just thought he was.\u00a0 Thought he was a hallucination, because he clearly had them quite often.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Little Wing,\u201d Dick\u2019s face split into something too sad to be called a smile, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stayed on the roof as Dick went back to his apartment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There had been days when all he wanted from his so-called older brother was an apology.\u00a0 Some kind of proof that he wasn\u2019t perfect, that he wasn\u2019t the golden hero everyone compared Jason to.\u00a0 Something that admitted he made mistakes too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now it felt hollow and sour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this time Jason\u2019s stone attack had startled the thug into actually firing and Nightwing made a pained yelp as he dove for cover.\u00a0 Before Jason could take out his gun and empty it into the thug that had dared to attack his brother, green surging up in fury, Nightwing leapt out again, electricity crackling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing managed to stay upright as he tied the criminal up and left him behind for the police, beginning to limp as he aimed his grapple.\u00a0 He made a sound like a strangled scream when he landed on the roof, staggering and nearly crumpling before he caught ahold of a vent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Jason said, not caring that his tone was edging close to begging, \u201cWing, you\u2019ve been hit, <em>go home</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis city needs me, Jaybird,\u201d Nightwing said, not even looking at him as he made his way to the edge of the roof.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how much good will you be when you\u2019re <em>dead</em>?\u201d Jason snarled, and the bitterness wasn\u2019t only aimed at Dick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing flinched.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Little Wing,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry for failing you.\u00a0 I should\u2019ve been there, I should\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you throw yourself in front of every bullet in this city in the hopes that it\u2019ll bring me back?\u201d Jason asked, his rage burning, \u201cOr in the hopes that you\u2019ll join me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nightwing stared out over the grimy expanse of the city, the one he\u2019d made his own, striking out from Batman\u2019s shadow and turning into a feared vigilante in his own right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes it feels like I\u2019m drowning,\u201d he said softly, \u201cLike I\u2019m sinking in weightless water.\u201d\u00a0 He turned and stared straight at Jason, \u201cAnd you\u2019re always there.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re pulling me up or forcing me down, Jaybird.\u201d\u00a0 His face twisted before easing out into a smile, \u201cBut I can\u2019t bring myself to let you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something thrummed inside Jason\u2019s heart, the twelve-year-old looking at his older, taller, glitteringly perfect older brother and wanting his approval, his attention, that beaming smile turned on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPoetic,\u201d Jason snapped and Dick laughed.\u00a0 \u201cGo home before you bleed out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I could hug you,\u201d Dick said, lost and alone and <em>broken</em> and Jason wavered.\u00a0 All he had to do was take a step forward and raise his arms and he could give Dick a hug.\u00a0 Letting the older boy think he was a hallucination was not worth Dick\u2019s sanity, it didn\u2019t matter how many of Jason\u2019s plans had been ruined, he\u2019d never be able to attack Dick now and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But there was still one person left.\u00a0 Still one name on the list, the one person who was the cause of all this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick gave him a soft smile and turned to go home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason followed him back, making sure he didn\u2019t get into any further trouble and hovering until Dick had finished his stitches and bandaged up the wound and passed out on the bed before he left, easing out the window and locking it behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was time to head to Gotham.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Talia had once told him it wasn\u2019t healthy to keep his anger bottled up.\u00a0 That the Pit fed on emotion and the more suppressed anger he had, the more frustration built up, the more fury seethed inside of him.\u00a0 Jason had taken her advice to heart, and killed each one of his teachers when they pissed him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The streets of Gotham were hazed in green when he swung through them, the drumbeat of <em>make-him-pay</em> in tune with his heartbeat, fury pulsing out and searching desperately for a target.\u00a0 He had his armor and guns, but he left the helmet behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wanted Batman to see his face.\u00a0 He wanted him to <em>see</em> what the worst case scenario was, what happened when he failed his partners.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason had died and Batman had done <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Had replaced Jason with another kid, a younger kid, like the Joker hadn\u2019t broken half the bones in his body before blowing him up, like that wasn\u2019t enough of a warning that Robin should\u2019ve died too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And before he\u2019d ever replaced Jason, he\u2019d replaced Dick, who was all alone in a city that wanted to eat him alive, falling apart piece by piece.\u00a0 Batman was a brooder, but Dick <em>wasn\u2019t</em>, Dick needed conversation and friends and happiness and Batman had just abandoned him in a city that was worse than Gotham.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The point of the no-killing rule was that death was permanent.\u00a0 The point of no killing was that death <em>meant</em> <em>something</em>.\u00a0 And Jason\u2019s death had changed nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the grave hadn\u2019t kept Jason, and he was going to beat the lesson into Batman\u2019s head.\u00a0 Or he was going to kill the man trying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t difficult to find him.\u00a0 The green hissed when it caught sight of a patch of sky darker than the night behind it, the pointed cowl framed against shadows.\u00a0 Jason eased up to the rooftop with the silence that Batman had trained into him and the League perfected.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman realized he was there when he was still ten feet away.\u00a0 He twisted, the dark cowl staring straight at him.\u00a0 Jason froze\u2014his guns were still holstered and he couldn\u2019t draw them before Batman lunged at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Batman didn\u2019t lunge at him.\u00a0 \u201cJay?\u201d he said\u2014in a voice that wasn\u2019t Batman, that was <em>Bruce</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason couldn\u2019t move.\u00a0 He had\u2014he hated Batman, hated what the man\u2019s crusade had done to the city, hated that he\u2019d gotten fired and then replaced from being Robin, hated every one of the man\u2019s stupid rules and his stupid cape and his stupid no-killing ideal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Bruce was\u2014Bruce was\u2014the green didn\u2019t know what to do with Bruce.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were tears prickling at the corner of Jason\u2019s eyes and it <em>wasn\u2019t fair\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman crouched down on the roof, sitting on the edge but still staring at Jason.\u00a0 What little was visible of his face was lined and worn.\u00a0 He looked <em>old</em>, and it was startling\u2014when Jason had been growing up, Bruce Wayne had always been timeless, and Batman even more so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, old man,\u201d Jason said softly.\u00a0 Batman rocked back, like the words were daggers, and dropped his head, bringing one gauntleted hand up to rub at his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason crept closer, and closer, and when Batman didn\u2019t even twitch, he slowly crouched to take a seat next to him, letting his legs dangle in empty air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could do it now.\u00a0 Batman\u2014Batman didn\u2019t think it was actually him, and Jason could shoot him right now and watch realization shatter into pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw that chili dog stand that you love,\u201d Bruce said quietly, \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry, Jay.\u00a0 I\u2014I wish\u2014what I wouldn\u2019t give to see you eating one of those again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t do it now.\u00a0 He should\u2019ve set up a sniper position on the next roof.\u00a0 He\u2014he couldn\u2019t\u2014he couldn\u2019t look into Bruce\u2019s face and plunge the dagger into his heart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stood up abruptly.\u00a0 Bruce stared at him\u2014one gauntleted hand twitched and balled into a fist and Jason stumbled back before Bruce could reach out and see that he was really there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to check on Dick,\u201d Jason said flatly, \u201cHe\u2019s falling apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Bruce said, gaze fixed on him like he couldn\u2019t look away, \u201cOkay, Jay.\u00a0 Anything you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason froze.\u00a0 <em>Anything you want</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKill him,\u201d Jason croaked out, before he lost his nerve, \u201cKill the Joker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Bruce\u2014if Batman just <em>did </em>it, if he ended the man who\u2019d <em>killed his son</em>, if Jason could be absolutely sure he\u2019d never run into a maniacal clown ever again, never hear the laughter that still haunted his dreams, the whistling of the crowbar\u2014the <em>fire\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman drooped, and turned away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him, green washing over him so quickly that the world took a sickly hue between one blink and the next.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I ever expected anything else,\u201d Jason said coldly, and twisted on his heel to stalk away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A dagger to the heart wasn\u2019t good enough.\u00a0 It was too easy.\u00a0 Too simple.\u00a0 Too\u2026random.\u00a0 If Batman was more concerned with the lives of his Rogues than the lives of his partners, well.\u00a0 It was clear what Jason had to become.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Red Hood rose to prominence among the Gotham\u2019s underworld startlingly fast.\u00a0 Some people called him a ghost because of his eerie propensity to disappear into thin air.\u00a0 Even the Bats couldn\u2019t catch him\u2014he moved one step ahead of them at all times, like he knew how they worked and what they\u2019d do next.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, a good chunk of those disappearing acts was Jason removing the armor and helmet whenever anyone got too close, exchanging the crime lord Red Hood for the hallucination of Jason Todd.\u00a0 It was an effective disguise, as long as he stayed away from the security cameras.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d already broken into the Cave to write himself a back door to delete any suspicious footage from the servers.\u00a0 Bruce had stopped dead in his tracks when he found him standing in front of a glass case holding a familiar, ragged uniform.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Displaying the gruesome trophy of his death.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA good soldier,\u201d Jason said out loud, resisting the urge to shatter the case into a hundred pieces.\u00a0 He turned to stare at Bruce, \u201cGuess now I know what you really thought of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce swallowed, his expression painful.\u00a0 \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what it means,\u201d he said softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Jason challenged, \u201cI thought I was your <em>son</em>!\u201d\u00a0 Bruce flinched back and Jason forced his voice down to avoid startling the bats.\u00a0 \u201cJust another soldier in your pointless crusade,\u201d Jason said dully, \u201cYou replaced me easily enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSave it, <em>Dad</em>,\u201d Jason sneered, and had the vicious satisfaction of seeing Bruce\u2019s face crack, \u201cIf you really cared, the Joker would be dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Bruce said, his voice breaking, \u201cJason, <em>please\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Jason said quietly, \u201cThat\u2019s how I begged, when I screamed for you to save me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce buried his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stalked out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Red Hood, the Rogue Batman couldn\u2019t catch.\u00a0 And Jason Todd, the very visible reminder of all his failures.\u00a0 Batman was cracking and Jason applied more pressure on the fault lines.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last piece of his plan fell into place when he learned that Alfred had taken a few days off.\u00a0 It gave access to the last place he needed to complete his assault on Batman\u2019s sanity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His room was exactly as he\u2019d left it\u2014not just his books on his shelves and his clothes in the closet, but literally <em>exactly</em> as he\u2019d left it, down to the homework on his desk\u2014which was creepy, but gave an added layer of surrealism to his appearance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He left the door open, reclined back to stare at the ceiling, and waited.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce stopped in the doorway.\u00a0 \u201cJason?\u201d he asked, his voice hesitant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason tilted his head to look at him, \u201cMorning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce opened his mouth, scanned both ends of the hallway, and closed it before shuffling out of view.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason grinned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStill haven\u2019t checked up on Dick,\u201d Jason noted, leaning against a gargoyle as Batman watched a building across the street.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s slight tension was the only indication that he\u2019d heard Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, is he not one of your good little soldiers?\u201d Jason asked, \u201cOr do you not care if you get another Robin killed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gauntleted hands curled into fists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I guess you never cared about any of us,\u201d Jason hummed, \u201cNot Dick, not Tim, and certainly not me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I check on Dick,\u201d Batman growled, \u201cWill you <em>go away</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jason drawled, smirking.\u00a0 Batman made a low, angry, inarticulate sound.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d Batman asked, his voice perilously close to cracking back to Bruce.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stared at him.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re the detective,\u201d Jason said softly, \u201cYou figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason planned a quiet night for the Red Hood, making the most of Batman\u2019s patrol for uninterrupted access to the Cave.\u00a0 His old logins still worked, and Batman and Robin weren\u2019t expected back for hours.\u00a0 It was time to get a better look at everything that had happened over the past three years from a slightly less biased source than the League of Assassins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason chose the first file out of morbid curiosity\u2014everything had hurt so much that the events had mostly just blurred together in his head, and an outside perspective would certainly be\u2026interesting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An autopsy report.\u00a0 Jason winced at the number of injuries and clicked to the next document.\u00a0 A report of the trip from the moment Batman had caught up to him, the details laid out without any emotion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason bared his teeth.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want Batman\u2019s <em>assessments</em>, he wanted the unfiltered truth.\u00a0 Jason switched to the cowl footage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Robin!\u00a0 Robin!\u00a0 No, no, NO!\u00a0 Robin, please\u2026Jay, please, you can\u2019t\u2014you can\u2019t be\u2014no, Robin, please wake up, Jay please, Jason, </em>please<em>!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason closed the file, his heart hammering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opened the next file, dated a couple of days later.\u00a0 Clearly Batman had wasted no time in going back on patrol.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a quiet night, no major deals going down, a simple patrol, just a couple muggings\u2014and Batman was beating the living shit out of one of those muggers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why?</em>\u201d Batman shouted, \u201c<em>Why do you deserve mercy when he got none?\u00a0 Why do you deserve to live when he died?\u00a0 WHY?!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason clicked the file closed with trembling fingers as a sickening crunch came through the video.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2014that was just the first few days.\u00a0 Jason hadn\u2019t seen any of that aggression when he showed up, so it was just temporary.\u00a0 A momentary surge in frustration due to the loss of a soldier.\u00a0 That was it.\u00a0 That had to be it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A week later, three teenagers cowering back from the pointed cowl.\u00a0 A month later, Jason wasn\u2019t even sure if the thug Batman dropped was even still breathing.\u00a0 Three months later, Batman nearly paralyzed a man when he was a little too slow in catching him after he threw him off a building.\u00a0 Six months later\u2014six months later, there was a kid sneaking around the rafters of a warehouse dressed in Jason\u2019s old suit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Batman growled, and Jason could hear the cracks in his tone, \u201c<em>No, not again, please no\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason nearly exited out of the computer in his haste to close the files.\u00a0 He stared into the darkness of the Cave, a lump growing in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t\u2014he didn\u2019t\u2014he was\u2014Batman had\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Joker was still alive.\u00a0 No matter what Batman had done, no matter how badly he went after the common criminals on Gotham\u2019s streets, the Clown Prince of Crime was <em>still alive</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason turned back to the computer, his jaw set and eyes burning, and typed in a search command.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first file was dated a month or so after his death and Jason opened the footage to a baffling scene\u2014someone had lost their marbles enough to declare the Joker as their ambassador?\u00a0 <em>Superman</em> was playing bodyguard?\u00a0 Batman was\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I won\u2019t let you kill him.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something clenched in Jason\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next video\u2014a ballroom in chaos, people screaming, a helicopter in the air, that <em>laughter\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was possible that Jason didn\u2019t think this all the way through.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Batman, stop!\u00a0 Batman!\u00a0 Batman!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason fumbled for the keyboard as he kept his hands clapped over his ears, cackles ringing out around him, he could hear metal scraping against the ground and whistling through the air and <em>he wouldn\u2019t stop laughing\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The view from the cowl abruptly jerked, the helicopter falling to the water, white face paint a bright blot against the metal.\u00a0 It hit dark waves and sank below them, twisted metal disappearing out of sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You could\u2019ve saved him.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One low, hoarse growl.\u00a0 \u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The video ended and the screen went dark.\u00a0 Jason slowly uncurled his hands from his ears and his fingers wavered over the keyboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He dragged the cursor back to the start of the video, and hovered over play.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>HA\u2014ha\u2014HA\u2014ha\u2014HA\u2014ha\u2014<em>\u201cWhich

squeezing his eyes shut and shoving away from the computer.\u00a0 He took heaving, ragged breaths but it wasn\u2019t enough, he hadn\u2019t prepared to hear that\u2014that\u2014that\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was fifteen years old again, and all he wanted was his <em>dad</em> and\u2014and Batman hadn\u2019t saved him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So why did Jason always go running back to him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Batmobile roared into the Cave, four hours too early, and Jason snapped his head up.\u00a0 The Batcomputer was still open to past files, he wasn\u2019t ready to face Batman and Robin, especially not with Joker\u2019s laughter ringing in his ears and his fury slipping out of reach.\u00a0 He stood there, frozen in the center of the Cave, as the Batmobile\u2019s doors opened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin hopped out first, and he didn\u2019t spare a single glance for Jason, instead moving to the other door.\u00a0 The minute he opened it, a dark shape spilled out and Robin nearly staggered under his weight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason unfroze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBatman,\u201d Robin said, clearly struggling, \u201cB, we\u2019re in the Cave, B, come on\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Batman snarled, \u201cNo, I need to get to him, no, let me go, <em>let me go</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB, you got hit with fear toxin,\u201d Robin said, wavering and dropping to one knee with a curse.\u00a0 Jason was at his side, and hefted up Batman\u2019s other arm, not saying a word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin stared at him for a long moment, eyes wide.\u00a0 \u201cJason?\u201d he asked tremulously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Batman hissed and Robin shook his head, swallowing and forcing himself upright.\u00a0 Between the two of them, they managed to get Batman to one of the cots on the medbay.\u00a0 Jason stepped back quickly as Tim tore off his mask and stared at Jason again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to save him, he\u2019s in trouble, I need to <em>go\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim pressed a shaky hand to his comm.\u00a0 \u201cNightwing,\u201d he said, squeezing his eyes shut, \u201cWe need an assist.\u00a0 Crane\u2019s out of Arkham.\u00a0 We both got hit\u2014latest antidote\u2019s not working.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jason</em>!\u201d Bruce screamed and Jason jolted.\u00a0 Batman levered up from the bed, trapped in the same nightmare that always played out behind Jason\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman hadn\u2019t saved him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Jason\u2014Jason was still <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason,\u201d Bruce said, broken and soft, and Jason moved.\u00a0 He tugged Bruce\u2019s cowl off and glanced over at Tim\u2014the kid had curled up in a chair, hands pressed over his ears and face buried into his knees, trembling faintly\u2014before catching one of Bruce\u2019s waving hands in his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason, no, please wake up, <em>please\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Jason said hoarsely, forcing Bruce to meet his gaze, \u201cBruce, I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m here, I promise I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce choked on a sob and Jason clutched his hand tighter, unable to stop his expression from twisting.\u00a0 \u201cI swear,\u201d he said, ragged, \u201cI\u2019m <em>right here</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was shaking, tears leaking from closed eyes, and Bruce let out a low, mournful sound.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason waited with them for half an hour, stretching the edge of Nightwing\u2019s earliest possible arrival, before he untangled his hand from Bruce\u2019s grip and straightened up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He closed down the files he was viewing, rerouted the footage of his visit, and wiped the evidence of his access.\u00a0 And then he went upstairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stared at the ceiling of his childhood bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Untouched.\u00a0 Cleaned.\u00a0 Like it was just waiting for him to come home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he couldn\u2019t come home.\u00a0 Or could he?\u00a0 Everything had seemed so obvious in the beginning, crystal clear with edges cut by green.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou remain unavenged.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which meant they didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 That he meant nothing to him.\u00a0 That they had never missed him, not even for a second.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But that wasn\u2019t true.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t kill the Joker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How could they not kill the Joker and still mourn his death?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How could they care if his murderer was still drawing breath?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>How</em>?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The green had no answer.\u00a0 The anger wasn\u2019t the simple, cold burning fury of revenge and righteousness, it was the vicious tangle of frustration and hurt and it didn\u2019t have a target.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason threw his arm off and stared back at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They missed the fifteen-year-old kid that slept in this room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They missed <em>Robin</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Red Hood was a poor compensation for what they\u2019d lost.\u00a0 A trained killer, a temperamental crime lord, everything that Batman had dreaded he\u2019d become.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t miss him.\u00a0 They <em>didn\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was getting really hard to convince himself of that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason took a seat at the table and stretched his legs out, leaning back and getting comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first one through the door was Bruce.\u00a0 He hesitated a full second when he caught sight of Jason, but then he rubbed at his eyes and took his normal seat at the head of the table.\u00a0 Dick was next, and he didn\u2019t even spare Jason a second glance before slumping in the seat across from him.\u00a0 Tim came in last, his gaze skittering over Bruce and Dick before pausing on Jason.\u00a0 He went still for a long, stretching moment, but crept in to take his seat before either of the other two noticed his preoccupation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason didn\u2019t even try to hide his smile, but he kept his mouth shut.\u00a0 This would certainly be an interesting breakfast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce took the track of completely ignoring him, ducking his head behind the newspaper.\u00a0 Dick gave him an answering smile as he curled up in his chair.\u00a0 Tim was squinting at him like he wasn\u2019t sure whether he should go get more coffee or cut back entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Alfred walked in, and the tray in his hands fell to the floor with a loud clatter.\u00a0 \u201cMaster Jason?\u201d he sucked in a sharp breath, eyes going wide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason grinned at him, \u201cHey, Alfie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The breakfast table immediately erupted into a clamor.\u00a0 Dick leapt out of his chair, face pale, Bruce\u2019s eyes were already narrowing, and Tim\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim reached a hand out, his eyes desperately hopeful, and Jason leaned across the table before the kid chickened out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He caught Tim\u2019s hand and laced his fingers with the kid\u2019s.\u00a0 Tim stared at him like\u2014like he\u2019d seen a dead boy come to life, and Jason couldn\u2019t see anything else because a heavy weight slammed into him nearly hard enough to send his chair tipping back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJaybird,\u201d Dick choked, his arms strangling tight around Jason, \u201cJaybird, you\u2019re <em>here</em>.\u00a0 You\u2019re alive.\u00a0 You\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Dickiebird,\u201d Jason murmured, wrapping his arms around his older brother.\u00a0 Dick dissolved into sobs and Jason awkwardly patted his head, trying to ignore the prickling in his own eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle Wing,\u201d Dick wailed and something fractured inside Jason\u2019s heart.\u00a0 He buried his face in Dick\u2019s hair before he did something stupid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason lifted his gaze.\u00a0 Bruce\u2019s face had gone completely bloodless\u2014everyone else in the kitchen was standing, shocked and stunned and speechless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Jason said hoarsely, \u201cIt\u2014\u201d digging out of his own grave as panic clawed at his throat, fragments of Gotham\u2019s streets, <em>green</em>, the blinding fury, the rage he could still feel churning inside of him, blunted but not tamed, waiting for the opportunity to strike\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hand cupped his cheek, large and gentle.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Bruce said, brushing a thumb over his cheekbone.\u00a0 He was\u2014he was <em>crying</em>.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0 Jason, you\u2019re home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bruce crouched so fast that Jason almost thought he\u2019d collapsed, pressing his forehead to Jason\u2019s as he squeezed his eyes shut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>alive,</em>\u201d Bruce choked out, \u201cJay-lad, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason pressed back, taking a deep, shuddering breath.\u00a0 \u201cDad,\u201d he murmured, and he couldn\u2019t hold back the tears anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim was frozen on the other side of the table, eyes wide and watery, and Alfred had a handkerchief pressed to his face.\u00a0 \u201cMaster Jason,\u201d he said, his voice choked up, \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014when did you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told me to make sure I was coming back, remember?\u201d Jason asked him, his voice cracking, \u201cI know I\u2019m a few years late, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alfred cut him off, tears streaming down his face, \u201cYou\u2019re home, and nothing else matters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a lump swelling in Jason\u2019s throat and he was surrounded by family and the room was getting blurry around him and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Did you miss me?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And they said <em>yes</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
