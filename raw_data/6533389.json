  "text": "<p>\u201cSo!\u201d the MC announces. \u201cPark Jimin, which shall it be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks at his choices. Three glittery placards hang from the wall the MC stands in front of.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Reflecting. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Bonding. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Giving.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jimin is currently selecting the mission he\u2019d like to undertake as part of a variety challenge for BTS. It\u2019s the whole gimmick for this new show they\u2019re on. It reminds him a bit of <em>Hello Counselor,</em> except that this show sends its celebrity guests away with their own little missions to complete. Which the hosts check back in on during the celebrities\u2019 next appearance, of course. </p>\n<p>Earlier in that same recording, another idol group had video called in to happily chat about the hilarious but beneficial results of a mission in which they all had to give each other compliments every day for a month. It\u2019s totally over the top, but Jimin is into it. It\u2019s all in the name of self-growth and fostering truth within the team, after all. And, he reminds himself, it\u2019s good to challenge yourself every now and then. </p>\n<p>And a challenge is even better when it\u2019s a challenge for multiple people. Right? It could improve some friendships, could bring the members even closer together. It would be fun! Right?</p>\n<p>Jimin wants to do just that, to bring himself and the members closer together. He doesn\u2019t want to \u2018reflect\u2019 by himself, whatever that means, and also he doesn\u2019t really understand what the \u2018giving\u2019 option means either, so by process of elimination, he picks: </p>\n<p>\u201cBonding.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd <em>oohs.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cGood choice!\u201d says the MC. \u201cA challenge between you and one other member! But, before you get to know the challenge, we\u2019re going to pick the group member who you will complete it with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get to pick?\u201d Jimin whines playfully. He already knew that he didn\u2019t get to, but he did kind of wish he could. Though, he guesses that might defeat the purpose of the \u2018challenge\u2019 altogether.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Jimin, you know you can\u2019t pick!\u201d The MC smiles. \u201cNow, we actually already had your mission partner picked out!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says, surprised. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust in case you chose \u2018bonding\u2019, your mission partner was selected for you ahead of time!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, great!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy your members!\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. </p>\n<p>Maybe...not so good.</p>\n<p>Jimin fights to keep a smile on his face. He already knows who it\u2019s going to be. </p>\n<p>\u201cSuga!\u201d The MC bellows. The crowd whoops and cheers. Jimin turns to see Yoongi, seated with the other members across the stage, raising a lazy hand in acknowledgment, his signature smirk already in place.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s already beginning to regret this. </p>\n<p>\u201cHere we go!\u201d the MC says, returning to the wall covered in glittery placards. \u201cLet\u2019s see what your mission will be!\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls the <em>Bonding</em> placard off of the wall. The glittery red sign underneath it reads, \u201c100 Days of Love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh yes!\u201d the MC says, pleased. \u201cThe 100-day love challenge!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s <em>really</em> beginning to regret this.</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic!\u201d The MC turns back to Jimin. \u201cThis means that you, Park Jimin, must tell Suga every day for one hundred days that you love him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin watches as Yoongi\u2019s mouth drops open, which is pretty hilarious. It would probably be more hilarious if Jimin\u2019s jaw hadn\u2019t joined his on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d is all Jimin thinks to say. <em>Oh.</em></p>\n<p>Okay. </p>\n<p>Look.</p>\n<p>Jimin knows why the other members picked Yoongi. The two of them are as opposite as bandmates can be. Yoongi <em>must</em> have been cornered into this role, probably overruled by a group vote. Because any sort of bonding exercise between them is bound to be slightly awkward, perhaps a bit embarassing for the two of them, but certanly entertaining for everyone else. But this...Jimin doesn\u2019t think he can do this.</p>\n<p>And yet. </p>\n<p>Jimin is not a quitter. Jimin asked for a challenge, and he\u2019s getting one. And he\u2019ll be damned if Yoongi\u2019s cranky ass is the reason he has to go back onto this show in a hundred days and tell them that he failed.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Jimin says with determination. </p>\n<p>The MC laughs. \u201cYes! And there\u2019s no need to be anxious! It\u2019ll be good! A great bonding experience! Right, BTS?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jimin looks to the group...who are barely attempting to hide how hilarious they find this. Jeongguk and Taehyung are stifling laughs, Seokjin\u2019s eyes are dancing with mirth, and Namjoon is giving a wide smile that Jimin finds disconcerting. At least Hoseok has the decency to look stunned. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Namjoon, <em>the bastard,</em> agrees with the MC.</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic!\u201d the MC declares again, unperturbed by their collective shitshow. </p>\n<p>\u201cEvery day?\u201d Jimin asks again, just to be sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery day!\u201d the MC confirms. \u201cJust saying \u2018I love you\u2019 once. That\u2019s all. But you have to say it every single day, or the challenge is lost! I\u2019m sure you can do it, though, right, Jimin?\u201d He grins, and Jimin feels the fire of a real goddamn challenge sparking within him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I can!\u201d He affirms. Now overcome with excitement, he turns towards Yoongi. \u201cI love you, hyung!\u201d he shouts across the soundstage.</p>\n<p>Yoongi is surprised, but after a second he laughs. </p>\n<p>This delights the MC. \u201cThere we go, day one! You\u2019ve already begun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDay one,\u201d Jimin repeats, holding up his index finger. Well, he might as well get started now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the results!\u201d the MC chirps. </p>\n<p>They go to commercial. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin begins the second day of the 100-Day Love Challenge (what a terrible name, he thinks to himself) as something of a joke. And when he treats it like that, the challenge isn\u2019t difficult at all. </p>\n<p>For that first week or so, Jimin tells Yoongi he loves him as soon as he sees him in the morning. \u201cI love you, hyung!\u201d he practically screams at Yoongi\u2019s half-awake form as the older stumbles into the kitchen on day three. Bless him, Yoongi\u2019s grumpiness only makes Jimin want to shout it louder. And it\u2019s made even funnier by the fact that Jimin is usually up way before Yoongi is. Jimin really, really enjoys being totally awake and alert and fully dressed as he yells lovingly at the rumpled, scowling, eyes-still-shut Yoongi.</p>\n<p>Something so beautiful could only last so long, though. On the ninth day, when a frowning Yoongi stumbles into the kitchen, Jimin opens his mouth to deliver his daily endearment-- except that he\u2019s immediately cut off by another voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go to the studio today,\u201d Namjoon tells Yoongi, totally oblivious to the fact that he is being a ruining ruiner who ruins, completely destroying Jimin\u2019s established ritual. \u201cThe building\u2019s shut down for the day, some sort of waterline repairs or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s scowl deepens, which Jimin thinks is pretty impressive for someone who is always already scowling. \u201cI wanted to finish mixing that song,\u201d he tells Namjoon. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s disappointing, Jimin sympathizes to himself. Oh well. Life is hard. He opens his mouth again and--</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Namjoon tells Yoongi calmly. \u201cBut we can\u2019t use the space, so we\u2019ll need to work on it from here or from somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi is not a big fan of these options, and Jimin watches with growing frustration as he and Namjoon continue back and forth. Namjoon tries to appease Yoongi, who is, as usual, unyielding. Taehyung and Jeongguk, eating at the table, wisely stay out of it. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Jimin was already planning to be in dance practice all day, and he doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll next see Yoongi, so now is their only guaranteed chance to talk. So Jimin keeps opening his mouth at what he hopes will be breaks in the conversation, except that Yoongi and Namjoon <em>just keep going.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Yoongi huffs dismissively at Namjoon, just when Jimin\u2019s given up. \u201cWe\u2019ll go somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Namjoon says agreeably. \u201cI\u2019m heading with Jimin to the building so I can talk to manager-nim for a minute and then I\u2019ll be back and we\u2019ll find somewhere to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Yoongi repeats sourly. He turns and begins walking in the opposite direction, probably to go get dressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Jimin shouts. </p>\n<p>Everyone in the kitchen freezes and turns towards him.</p>\n<p>Looking Yoongi in the eye, Jimin says seriously, \u201cI love you, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a long pause, Taehyung bursts into laughter. Beside him, Jeongguk joins in, snickering. </p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s face heats up. He didn\u2019t mean to make it so awkward, but he <em>had</em> to do it.</p>\n<p>Yoongi is completely taken aback until he remembers the mission. \u201cOkay, Park Jimin,\u201d he replies neutrally, and then he\u2019s heading away again.</p>\n<p>Namjoon, who\u2019s waiting for Jimin by the front door, is barely holding back giggles. </p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Jimin tells him, his face still a bit hot. He puts on his coat and pushes out the door.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>As they get deeper into promotions it gets a bit harder for Jimin to fulfill his mission every day. Jimin\u2019s morning ritual is totally corrupted-- he\u2019s so busy scrambling around as soon as he gets up and then running from place to place thereafter that he usually doesn\u2019t remember to tell Yoongi he loves him until halfway into the day. </p>\n<p>He learns something important in the process, though, which is that it\u2019s really awkward to have to tell one of your members on the regular that you love them without a schedule in place that makes it clearly compulsory. The end result is that Jimin ends up telling Yoongi he loves him at strange times and in strange places. </p>\n<p>At first he just says it whenever he remembers. On days thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen he shouts it at Yoongi when, respectively, they are having their mic headsets taped to them before a performance; when they\u2019re about to go into the recording booth for a radio interview; and when they\u2019re having their makeup done before a photoshoot.</p>\n<p>At that last one, Jimin had shrieked it so loudly and abruptly that he\u2019d even surprised himself, but also the makeup artist working on him, who had skittered back in terror. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry!\u201d he told her apologetically. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s this thing, sorry!\u201d </p>\n<p>Yoongi just made a face at him from across the room.</p>\n<p>Yoongi always accepts the \u2018I love you\u2019s, but he also always looks a bit irritated being shouted at, and it does seem to embarass him somewhat when others are around. The members don\u2019t tease after the first week as much as they did in the beginning, but Jimin still isn\u2019t quite that cruel to keep embarassing Yoongi over and over again-- even if it <em>is</em> pretty funny-- so he tries to tone it down.</p>\n<p>On day eighteen, for example, the group has a tense meeting with management. Jimin recalls his mission partway into the meeting, and when this thought leads him to look at Yoongi, he begins to watch the others\u2019 expression. He quickly becomes distracted by how uncomfortable Yoongi seems throughout the meeting, appearing annoyed but, even moreso, exhausted. </p>\n<p>As they leave the meeting to return to their dorms, the mood low, Jimin sidles up to Yoongi and tells him very quietly, \u201cHyung, I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi turns to look at him, surprised. After a second, he gives Jimin a tired little smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says back just as quietly, and they don\u2019t say anything more until they\u2019re back at the dorm.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>For the days in the twenties Jimin gets a bit quieter around the challenge, waiting until others aren\u2019t around, or, if they are, making sure to say it so that Yoongi is the only one who will hear. </p>\n<p>On night twenty-three he mumbles it as they both half-heartedly brush their teeth like zombies in front of the bathroom mirror, almost passing out right then and there from the exhaustion of back-to-back performances on three hours of sleep. </p>\n<p>On day twenty-seven he says it as he passes by Yoongi\u2019s room on his way to his own bed, seeing Yoongi already sprawled out across his bunk. (All he gets in return is a grunt, which Jimin decides is good enough.)</p>\n<p>Jimin thinks about setting a daily alarm on his phone just in case he forgets one day, but for some reason that kind of ruins the challenge in his mind. He likes having to remember it himself, likes having to think cleverly so that he can work it into his day. </p>\n<p>And...sometimes the way it happens so randomly, the way he\u2019ll spring it on Yoongi when it just happens to be the two of them alone for a few seconds-- there\u2019s something about that that pleases Jimin. It might only be as they pass each other in the dorm hallway, and yeah, everyone else might know about the challenge anyway, but Jimin likes that it feels like it\u2019s just them doing the mission together, in secret, for just a moment.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin starts to get kind of stealthy about it, a feat on which he prides himself. </p>\n<p>On day twenty-eight they\u2019re waiting backstage before a performance, and Jimin passes behind where Yoongi is seated, lightly touching his shoulder as he moves by. \u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d he says softly, pausing for just a second to duck down so he\u2019ll be heard, and then continues on his way. </p>\n<p>Jimin settles down in front of a mirror on the other side of the room to check his hair, and belatedly realizes that he can see Yoongi\u2019s reflection. He catches the other, unaware that he\u2019s being watched, staring after Jimin with an unreadable expression.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The quietness of the twenties continues on into the mid-thirties.</p>\n<p>(He does break this quiet streak, once, when he remembers in the middle of dance practice that he hasn\u2019t yet told Yoongi that day that he loves him. They\u2019re doing this new chereography where they sort of \u2018pass\u2019 the energy of their movement from one person to one another, the first person freezing as the next one takes on the energy and moves, and it\u2019s just too irresistable. Jimin waits until it\u2019s turn to pass the energy on to Yoongi and shouts, \u201cI love you, hyung!\u201d over the music as he directs a powerful gust of movement at him. Everyone cracks up, even Yoongi, and for the rest of the dance, whenever energy gets passed, the members shout their endearments to each other. \u201cI love you, Jeongguk!\u201d Hoseok bellows, overdramatically dropping to one knee and proferring his energy to Jeongguk like a marriage proposal. \u201cBe mine, Tae!\u201d Namjoon howls, his hand to his heart as he passes his movement on to Taehyung. Jimin almost dies from laughter.)</p>\n<p>On day thirty-six, Jimin tells Yoongi without fanfare as they all sit down around the table to open up bags of takeout. Jimin settles down beside Yoongi, who\u2019s already digging into a noodle dish.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d Jimin tells Yoongi casually, quietly, so that only Yoongi can hear.</p>\n<p>Yoongi just nods, and then wordlessly directs his chopsticks, laden with food, at Jimin. Jimin opens his mouth reflexively, and Yoongi pops the food in. </p>\n<p>Jimin sits there chewing, watching Yoongi as the older goes back to feeding himself, and Yoongi is being totally casual about it. Because it\u2019s a totally casual thing. It\u2019s casual, right?</p>\n<p>Right?</p>\n<p>Jimin feels the tips of his earns burn, and he doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>That evening, after they\u2019ve eaten and talked some and then split up to settle into their own spaces across the dorm, Jimin sits by himself on his bunk and thinks. He runs through the challenge in his head; he contemplates his responsibility to report back to the show hosts later. </p>\n<p>Everything makes sense up until a point. And that point appears to be Yoongi.</p>\n<p>Jimin sits up thinking about it until it\u2019s two in the morning and he gets hungry enough to head to the kitchen. On his way back, he stops outside the entrance to his hyungs\u2019 room.</p>\n<p>Peeking his head in the door, he sees Namjoon, Seokjin, and Yoongi all passed out on their respective bunks. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Jimin quietly pads into the room and kneels over by the head of Yoongi\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>Yoongi is completely under, absolutely dead to the world. Jimin watches as an inner voice simultaneously shouts to him that he should not be watching. It\u2019s such a pleasant sight, though, and Jimin gets way more satisfaction from it than he can quite explain. </p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin finds himself whispering and gently jostling the older\u2019s shoulder. <em>What are you doing, Park Jimin?</em> the voice inside his head warns him, but he ignores it. \u201cHyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi blinks a couple times and quirks his mouth, which is strangely adorable. \u201cJimin?\u201d he finally asks, voice sleep-rough.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin hears himself say. His voice is shaky. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi closes his eyes and quirks his mouth again. \u201cYou said it...this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin is surprised that Yoongi remembers. \u201cThat was yesterday,\u201d he whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s the next morning now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Yoongi breathes, accepting this explanation. His eyes are still shut. Jimin can\u2019t look away from his face.</p>\n<p>Jimin gets up to leave when he hears Yoongi say very quietly, as he rolls himself back into his covers, \u201cyou too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart clenches.</p>\n<p>He returns to his room and lays face down on his bed for a very long time and doesn\u2019t understand anything at all.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin is out of it for the entirety of the next day, restless and uncomfortable in his own skin. He wants to move, but as soon as he gets up all he wants is to sit back down again. He paces across the waiting room backstage at a performance and randomly seats himself, then springs back up again seconds later. He notices that Namjoon looks away from his conversation with Seokjin and Hoseok near the makeup stations to watch for a while. </p>\n<p>Namjoon finally, carefully makes his way over to the couch that Jimin\u2019s sitting on, and perches on the arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Namjoon asks, not pushing, just curious.</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says honestly. </p>\n<p>Namjoon nods like this makes sense. \u201cYou wanna talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pouts. \u201cMaybe...maybe later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon smiles. \u201cAlright.\u201d He moves to stand from the couch. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds quitely, \u201cif the other guys are giving you a hard time about the challenge and it\u2019s giving you a problem-- me included,\u201d Namjoon grimaces, apparently at his own potential behavior, \u201c--then let me know, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Caught off guard, Jimin nods. But that\u2019s not even what\u2019s bothering him, he realizes with a strange sort of embarassment. Isn\u2019t that supposed to be the hard part of this, getting teased for it? Or at least, one of the <em>harder</em> parts? Yeah, the members are still teasing him about it a bit here and there, but Jimin is jarred by the realization that it hasn\u2019t factored into his current internal crisis even a little bit.</p>\n<p>-- </p>\n<p>\u201cPark Jimin, we\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve got a very interesting mission on your hands,\u201d the radio show host opens.</p>\n<p>Jimin gives a nervous laugh. Every other host or MC wants to check in on Jimin\u2019s progress. While it wasn\u2019t too bad in the beginning, lately Jimin\u2019s been feeling nervous about discussing the whole situation. It\u2019s like he\u2019s done something wrong or has some secret to hide, even though he knows he hasn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do!\u201d he says as cheerily as he can. Jimin looks to Yoongi, whose steady gaze is directed at the host. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat day are you on?\u201d the host asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDay thirty-eight,\u201d Jimin confirms.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost halfway there?\u201d the host tries, and some of the members laughs. \u201cOkay, maybe not! But still, it\u2019s very admirable that you\u2019ve made it this far.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gives a smile that he hopes doesn\u2019t look like a grimace. \u201cAw, it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not been hard then?\u201d the host smiles politely. \u201cIt\u2019s not so hard to tell your hyung you love him every day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi has turned his gaze to Jimin. His face is impassive. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad at all,\u201d Jimin says softly, looking back at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks away.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>On day forty-one, Jimin stands in front of the dorm washing machine; next to him, Seokjin silently folds the clean laundry out of the dryer. Jimin checks the clothes over for stains before he puts them in, holding the stain-fighting spray at the ready. </p>\n<p>Jesus, their group is messy. There\u2019s splotches of yellow sauce on several t-shirts and soda on someone\u2019s pairs of pants. Possibly the rusty color of kimchi has exploded all over the chest of a white sweater. And there are dirt stains on the knees of a pair of Taehyung\u2019s jeans which Jimin inspects incredulously. <em>Where the hell did he even find dirt to play in?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Seokjin says suddenly. He keeps on folding clothes, casual, but Jimin can tell just from how he said that one word that he means business. \u201cHow\u2019s the thing with Yoongi going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jimin says automatically.</p>\n<p>Seokjin seems unbothered, making a face that\u2019s the equivalent of a shrug. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jimin mutters, just like he did to Namjoon. </p>\n<p>When Seokjin just keeps folding clothes, not saying anything, Jimin feels his confession bubbling to the surface. \u201cThe mission-- I don\u2019t understand why, but it feels like it might be changing everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seokjin waits until he sees that Jimin is done, and then he takes this in, not asking any questions-- just contemplating as he returns to folding clothes. Trying to be patient, Jimin returns to his task as well. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever considered,\u201d Seokjin finally asks, gently, \u201cthat this is just as much a challenge for Yoongi as it is for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin considers this.</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>No. He hadn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Jimin had never thought about it like that before.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>On day forty-three, Jimin is sitting at the kitchen table with Hoseok, Jeongguk, and Seokjin when his phone rings. </p>\n<p><em>Yoongi,</em> the screen announces. </p>\n<p>Yoongi almost never calls him-- Jimin\u2019s lucky if Yoongi even texts. And last Jimin checked, Yoongi had been locked away in the recording studio all evening with Namjoon, with no reason to call Jimin. Confused, Jimin picks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung?\u201d he greets.</p>\n<p>\u201cPark Jimin,\u201d the low voice greets him. It sounds amused. \u201cIs there something that you\u2019ve forgotten about today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin checks himself over. Well, he <em>is</em> wearing pants. \u201cNo?\u201d he guesses.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only silence from Yoongi\u2019s end, but Jimin knows better than to ask. Yoongi is patient in moments like this, only dropping hints or staying silent; he\u2019ll wait until Jimin\u2019s figured whatever it is out for himself.</p>\n<p>After a stretch of nothing Yoongi finally says, \u201cIt\u2019s eleven forty-three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk, Seokjin, and Hoseok all startle when Jimin jumps in his seat and shouts. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d He\u2019d almost completely forgotten and broken his streak.</p>\n<p>Yoongi laughs from the other end. \u201cYes,\u201d he agrees. His voice is so low. Jimin really enjoys hearing it, especially the smooth flow of his own name. <em>Park Jimin.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Thank god Yoongi called. Jimin takes a deep breath and speaks. \u201cI love you, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>It comes out of his mouth so different from how he\u2019d expected it to, and it catches him completely off guard. It sounds almost sweet, moving beyond the regular register of endearing and funny and into the territory of affectionate and vulnerable. </p>\n<p>He hears that shift in air over the phone that indicates tension on Yoongi\u2019s end as well.</p>\n<p>The others at the table are staring at him.</p>\n<p>After some more silence Yoongi huffs, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin returns helplessly. What else is there to say?</p>\n<p>Eventually Yoongi just says, \u201cGood night, Park Jimin.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t read Yoongi\u2019s tone at all. \u201cGood night,\u201d he echoes. </p>\n<p>Jimin hears the beep marking the end of the call. Jimin puts the phone down in his lap, and then chances a look back up at the others.</p>\n<p>Everyone has some expression of shock or awe. Seokjin\u2019s making an effort to conceal it, but Jeongguk and Hoseok aren\u2019t trying, Instead, the latter two exchange a look that says something massive, but which Jimin can\u2019t decipher.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin snaps, and all three abruptly look away. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Seokjin finally says.</p>\n<p>Jimin gets up and stalks out of the room.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Things become tense after that. Part of Jimin understands why everything is uncomfortable now, but another part of him doesn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure that he wants to know, though. He\u2019s scared of the answer.</p>\n<p>He still tells Yoongi he loves him every day. It\u2019s rough, though, because it\u2019s become something neither of them wants to be experiencing. A few times, Jimin comes close to leaving behind little \u201csaranghae, hyung\u201d notes on Yoongi\u2019s bed or desk so that he doesn\u2019t have to say it face to face, but he knows deep down that that would just be wrong. He made his committment, he\u2019s sticking to it. Things will get better. They can\u2019t stay awkward forever.</p>\n<p>Only once during this process does Jimin think seriously about giving up. It\u2019s when he\u2019s lying in bed in the evening of day fifty-- the halfway point. </p>\n<p>A few hours earlier, he had summed up the courage to talk to Yoongi, saving his \u2018I love you\u2019 for when it was just the two of them (which Jimin thought was a pretty polite move on his part), and Yoongi had just scoffed in response.</p>\n<p>And it had ticked Jimin the fuck off. Did Yoongi think this was some kind of joke? </p>\n<p>And so, that one time, Jimin had thought about the consequences of quitting the challenge. </p>\n<p>Well, it would be literally <em>nationally</em> if not <em>globally</em> embarassing, and he would be tortured on air, variety-style, for an explanation. </p>\n<p>And the other members would probably never let up on him about it. Their teasing about the challenge had almost completely disappeared by this point, but Jimin\u2019s confident that ending the mission early would provide them with plenty of new material. </p>\n<p>But both of those things can be dealt with. Jimin can tell the show hosts that he and Yoongi got physically separated because of work schedules and just couldn\u2019t carry on without it being a terrible hassle. Or they could pretend and lie and say later that Jimin <em>did</em> complete the challenge. And he can handle the other members. He\u2019s dealt with their jokes before and he can deal with them again, and if worse comes to worse, he can take Namjoon up on his earlier offer, and have a serious conversation with the leader or Seokjin about it.</p>\n<p>But what really stops him, what really keeps him from quitting, is this one scenario that he replays in his head over and over again. Jimin saw it in a dream after he started thinking seriously about quitting the challenge, and it hasn\u2019t left him since. </p>\n<p>The image is of Yoongi talking with a stranger. The stranger has learned about Jimin giving up on the challenge, and keeps asking Yoongi, \u201cwhy?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he tell you he loved you every day?\u201d The stranger asks. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi, trying to appear uncaring, would shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he would say.</p>\n<p>Jimin imagines being asked in real life. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you do it?\u201d the stranger asks Jimin. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell him you loved him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either,\u201d he whispers aloud to himself.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>On day fifty-four, or really the evening of day fifty-four, the tension hits its peak. Yoongi and Jimin have a fight unlike anything they\u2019ve ever had before. </p>\n<p>The two of them, of course, are bound to bicker from time to time. They\u2019re just so different as people. But it usually doesn\u2019t go beyond faux playful name-calling, and it rarely gets to Jimin calling Yoongi an ass and Yoongi telling Jimin to stop being so sensitive. But it\u2019s never <em>ever</em> gone this far, to where Yoongi is venomous and Jimin is screeching.</p>\n<p>\u201c--I told you not to bother me--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c--I shouldn\u2019t have to <em>apologize</em> for <em>caring</em> about you--\u201c</p>\n<p>What makes this situation even more excellent, Jimin realizes, is that it\u2019s a completely useless fight. He doesn\u2019t even remember how or why or where it started. But it ended up here, in the cramped little BTS work room in the Big Hit building, and the flames are climbing higher and higher. Yoongi is angrier than Jimin\u2019s ever seen him, and Jimin is ready to <em>tear down the building.</em></p>\n<p>\u201c--you never listen to me, Park Jimin, you\u2019ve <em>never</em> listened to me even once in your life--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c-- I\u2019m just trying to be a good friend, someone who looks out for you, and you always treat me like a child--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c--I can\u2019t treat you like an adult when you\u2019re being a fucking spoiled little brat--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c--how can you call <em>me</em> a brat when you always behave like a big baby--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c--oh get real, <em>get real,</em> you\u2019re living in another world, Park Jimin--\u201c</p>\n<p>And Jimin can\u2019t take it anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t <em>call</em> me that!\u201d he finally screams. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking call me that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi reels back.</p>\n<p>Jimin realizes they\u2019re both panting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>hate</em> when you say my name!\u201d Jimin shouts, and he actually feels like he\u2019s about to cry. Fuck, fuck, fuck. He shakes his head in an attempt to dislodge his emotions from his body. It doesn\u2019t work. \u201cI hate it,\u201d he says again, miserably, and the lie burns through his bones.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s expression has turned to stone. \u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t say it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Jimin spits.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo then,\u201d Yoongi says, turning his back to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will.\u201d Jimin snatches his jacket off of the couch and stomps out.</p>\n<p>Fuck fuck <em>fuck.</em> How did this even happen? Jimin feels anger and regret course through him in equal measure as he flies down the stairs, too impatient for the elevator. Down, down, down, and he hates everything in the world, everything that\u2019s lead him here, everything that\u2019s made this moment possible. Down, down, down, and he hates Yoongi, hates him like he\u2019s never hated another human being in his life. Down, down, down, and Jimin decides that it\u2019s him, he hates <em>himself,</em> his own sorry existence, more than anything or anyone else in this world.</p>\n<p>His sneakers slap against the wet pavement as he exits the building, and it takes a couple seconds for him to realize that it\u2019s raining. <em>Of course.</em> Of course. Of course tonight is the night that it rains. Of course tonight is the night that he has to have a monumental blowout with Yoongi, when it\u2019s so late that he has to find his back to the dorm by himself in the dark, and he\u2019ll probably have to catch a fucking cab. Jimin yanks his jacket tighter around his body, huddling down into the collar. Of course there isn\u2019t a ride available to take him back to the dorm, because everyone but Yoongi is back there already, and it\u2019s almost midnight and--</p>\n<p>\n<em>Almost midnight.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Shit. Fuck. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost midnight. </p>\n<p>Jimin hastily checks his phone. </p>\n<p>\n<em>11:52.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Fuck fuck fuck. Without even thinking, Jimin spins around and begins to run back towards the building. How long had he been walking? A couple of minutes? Shit. He needs to hurry. He pushes himself to move faster, trying not to slip on the wet sidewalk. He was already angry and panting before, and now his breath is coming even shorter. The cold air is sharp in his lungs. Jimin starts to see the building\u2019s facade. He\u2019s getting closer. How much time has passed? He can\u2019t stop and check his phone for the time, and he\u2019s moving too fast to try and read it properly while running. Shit. He\u2019s almost there, almost there. The front of the building is right before him, he feels like he can almost reach out and grab it. He runs straight through the entrance, immediately thankful for the glass doors that push in. He sacrifices three precious seconds to check his phone once he\u2019s inside. <em>11:56.</em> Shit. He sprints straight for the stairwell, unwilling to wait for the elevator for the second time that same night. Up, up, up, and his lungs are burning, he\u2019s in so much pain, but he has to get there. Up, up, up, and his legs are going to give out, his knees ache, but he has no choice but to keep moving. Up, up, up, and every part of his body is scorching in agony, but he\u2019s still not going fast enough, he needs to go <em>faster.</em></p>\n<p>Jimin throws open the door to the correct floor and practically falls onto the landing, catching himself just in time. He dashes down the hallway, down past all the other rooms, until he sees that familiar door, the one he knows so well, and when he sees it he flings his entire body at it, latching onto the handle and pushing down on it with all of his weight and it turns, thank god, it\u2019s unlocked, and it swings opens and--</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s back is to Jimin as the older stands facing a corner of the office, his shoulders slumped. At the sound of Jimin\u2019s entrance he whips around. His expression switches from vacant to startled.</p>\n<p>Jimin goes to speak but-- there\u2019s nothing coming out but harsh pants. </p>\n<p>Yoongi looks on in what might be terror. </p>\n<p>Jimin forces himself to swallow a few breaths as he hunches over. Then, gathering every ounce of willpower left inside of him, he takes one last deep breath and chokes out:</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause that lasts for one second, or maybe a million years. </p>\n<p>And then, for the first time in his life, Jimin sees Yoongi cry.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s face screws up, and he turns very red, and then he frantically turns away from Jimin, crumpling. Jimin watches in disbelief as Yoongi tries to hide his face with his hands even though his back is already to Jimin. The older lets out a sharp cry and begins to move, apparently searching for an impossible hiding spot in the tiny studio.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin says weakly, trying to follow Yoongi with his arms outstretched without accidentally back-hugging him. \u201cHyung. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He reaches a hand out to Yoongi, who immediately bats it away, quickly returning his hands to his face. </p>\n<p>Yoongi finally lets himself drop to the floor in a corner, curling in on himself. Jimin immediately settles down next to him, and Yoongi makes a strangled sound that might be humiliation at Jimin\u2019s persistent proximity. </p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jimin says again. He doesn\u2019t know what else to say. He\u2019s seen a couple tears escape from the corners of Yoongi\u2019s eyes on a few occasions, but never anything like this.</p>\n<p>He wonders if it would be a good idea to offer Yoongi a tissue. He also doesn\u2019t have any tissues to offer, though, so maybe nevermind.</p>\n<p>Yoongi continues to sob into his own folded-up form, and Jimin wonders how long Yoongi\u2019s been holding in whatever this is. He keeps letting out these high-pitched cries that Jimin can feel down to his core. Jimin finally takes a chance and puts a hand on Yoongi\u2019s back to try and comfort him. The older either doesn\u2019t notice it or doesn\u2019t care, just keeps crying, and so Jimin carefully rubs circles on Yoongi\u2019s back until the crying lets up, trying not to cry himself.</p>\n<p>Jimin expects Yoongi to do something along the lines of shooting him a glare and saying \u201cthis never happened\u201d once he can speak again, but instead, Yoongi lifts his head up from where it was hidden within his arms and gives a morose, resigned groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaaaaaaahhhhhhhh,\u201d he announces stuffily to the wall in front of him.</p>\n<p>Jimin lets out a laugh.</p>\n<p>Yoongi lets his head loll against his own shoulder. His face is a mess, and he still hasn\u2019t looked at Jimin. \u201cThat was embarassing,\u201d he mumbles. </p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin says, suddenly struck by the need to say this out loud, but he finds himself whispering it, like someone else might hear, \u201cYou know I really do love you, right? I really do. I swear.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yoongi tucks his face into the crook of one of his elbows, hiding half of his expression from Jimin. He doesn\u2019t respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin pleads, his voice now choked-up, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? I don\u2019t even remember what I did but I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s not fight again.\u201d</p>\n<p>After several long seconds, Yoongi raises his head slightly from the cage of his arms and gives a little nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Jimin whispers. \u201cLet\u2019s, let\u2019s go home, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi hesitates, then shakes his head. \u201cYou go,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI\u2019m gonna stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin really just wants to go home with Yoongi by his side, but he also has to respect that Yoongi might need to be by himself. And, Jimin realizes, Yoongi seems to cry so infrequently that this might be a big deal for him. Maybe he has to journal about it or something.</p>\n<p>Later that night, lying in his bed, Jimin realizes that he never checked his phone to see if he\u2019d gotten his \u2018I love you\u2019 under the midnight mark. </p>\n<p>For some reason, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter anymore.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>On day fifty-seven, the group sits in the dressing room of one of the larger sound stages, filming for their next music video.</p>\n<p>Already finished with his filming, Jimin goes to watch the other members do their closeups. When Yoongi walks by Jimin and onto the set to take his turn, Jimin sees something and stops Yoongi with a light touch on his arm. Yoongi turns to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have something on your face,\u201d Jimin explains.</p>\n<p>Yoongi makes an \u201cah\u201d expression of understanding and then gets that slack sort of look giving tacit permission to touch his face. Jimin raises his thumb to Yoongi\u2019s cheek and swipes at the eyelash that clings there, but it won\u2019t move. </p>\n<p>He leans in closer and more carefully runs his finger across Yoongi\u2019s face. Yoongi is totally still beneath him.</p>\n<p>Jimin finally captures the eyelash. \u201cGot it,\u201d he announces, and Yoongi opens his eyes back up. Jimin thinks about asking Yoongi if he\u2019d like to make a wish and blow the eyelash away, but then decides that Yoongi wouldn\u2019t be very into that, so Jimin makes his own wish and blows it away. </p>\n<p>He realizes that he and Yoongi are quite close to each other. The older is staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took my wish,\u201d Yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin asks, surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stole my wish,\u201d Yoongi accuses, looking the slightest bit affronted. \u201cThat was <em>my</em> wish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want it,\u201d Jimin defends. \u201cBesides, you don\u2019t know that I actually did make a wish. I could\u2019ve just been getting rid of the eyelash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw you make you a wish,\u201d Yoongi assures him, but Jimin sees a hint of a smile on his face. Jimin can\u2019t help but smile back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d he hears himself say.</p>\n<p>Jimin might be exhausted and making things up, and the light <em>is</em> pretty dim where they\u2019re standing on the set\u2019s periphery, but he thinks he sees the faintest pink tinging Yoongi\u2019s cheeks. </p>\n<p>Hesitantly, Yoongi informs him, \u201cyou already said it today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin thinks about it. Huh. He did. It had been that morning, on their way out of the dorm. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin confesses, \u201cI forgot.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d is all Yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-ah!\u201d Their manager bellows from the set, and they both jump.</p>\n<p>Yoongi quickly turns and walks towards the cameras, and Jimin settles in to watch the next set of filming.</p>\n<p><em>Wow,</em> he thinks, as someone holds one of those light-testing gadgets up to Yoongi\u2019s face. Jimin must really not be paying attention if he\u2019s said it twice in one day. Which doesn\u2019t make any sense, because he\u2019s been trying so hard lately to be so careful about it. </p>\n<p>He wonders if this means he can skip saying it tomorrow.</p>\n<p>No, he decides. He\u2019ll still want to say it anyway.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing to grab some food,\u201d Yoongi grunts as he enters the living room on day sixty-one, zipping up his coat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin replies, because even though he didn\u2019t ask for that information-- actually, he didn\u2019t even know Yoongi was in the dorm in the first place. Jimin is the only person in the living room, so he guesses Yoongi\u2019s update was directed at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi says, fixing his clothes so he can leave. And then he just sort of starts rustling around the room. </p>\n<p>Yoongi seems to be doing a lot of inexplicable rustling in Jimin\u2019s general vicinity lately. Jimin wonders if maybe he\u2019s looking for something. This seems like the kind of rustling around that someone would do if they couldn\u2019t find their glasses, like people in movies and on TV do. Yoongi doesn\u2019t wear glasses, but Jimin likes to imagine him with a blocky pair perched on his head as he fruitlessly searches for them in a cluttered room.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing good in the dorm to eat,\u201d Yoongi explains, even though he didn\u2019t really need to.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Jimin agrees. Their fridge is slightly embarassing in its selection right now, but this always seems to happen at a certain point in promotions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then,\u201d Yoongi eventually says. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back,\u201d Yoongi adds, lingering.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Jimin says.</p>\n<p>Yoongi makes to move, then halts himself.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s already told Yoongi he loves him today, so he\u2019s not really sure what Yoongi\u2019s weirdness is all about. Has Yoongi forgotten that Jimin had told him at breakfast?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re...are you hungry?\u201d Yoongi asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just ate,\u201d Jimin says. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Yoongi says, looking strangely conflicted. \u201cI can get you something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Jimin reminds him, \u201cI just ate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Yoongi says again, then stares at Jimin.</p>\n<p>After a really long pause, Jimin realizes that maybe Yoongi wants company. But before he can say anything, Yoongi\u2019s heading out the door, a quick \u201cbye\u201d carrying back to Jimin. Maybe he didn\u2019t want company after all.</p>\n<p>Weird.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin is being shaken awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d a low voice whispers. Then, louder, <em>\u201cJimin.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Jimin reluctantly opens his eyes. </p>\n<p>Yoongi is crouched over in the darkness next to Jimin\u2019s bed, his arm reaching out to grip Jimin\u2019s shoulder. He looks terribly unsettled. He almost never looks like that, which wakes Jimin up a little. He hopes everything\u2019s alright.</p>\n<p>\u201cWussit?\u201d Jimin slurs, opening his eyes as big as he can.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin,\u201d Yoongi says again, and suddenly he sounds nervous. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Jimin rubs at his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay--\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cSay <em>it.</em> Tell me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin is confused. Yoongi huffs out a breath, looks away, and almost immediately looks back at Jimin again.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me you love me again,\u201d he says very quickly.</p>\n<p>Jimin is even more confused. He reaches under his pillow for his phone and wakes up the screen. <em>10:58.</em> \u201cI already said it today,\u201d he croaks. He had, marking his sixty-fourth day, when they were sitting alone on the couch in the dorm\u2019s living room watching TV. Being the nice person he is, he\u2019d waited until a commercial break to say it, he remembers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Yoongi says, sounding rushed. \u201cJust-- just, say it one more time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin agrees, accepting the wierdness of the situation because what matters is that there\u2019s no big emergency and no one is hurt, and now he just wants to go back to sleep. He lets his eyes fall shut. \u201cHyung, I--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yoongi cuts him off. \u201cLook at me when you say it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pries his eyes open. </p>\n<p>Yoongi is still crouched by the bed, now almost imperceptibly rocking back and forth on his heels. This is definitely the strangest conversation the two of them had in a while. But, it\u2019s not like it hurts to say it, so...</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin says, making eye contact through his bleary vision as best he can. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of looking satisfied, Yoongi looks stricken. Jimin shuffles over and extends a hand to comfort him, but Yoongi darts away, out of reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Jimin tries, even though he doesn\u2019t really understand what the problem is. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything\u2019s <em>not</em> going to be okay,\u201d Yoongi says, sharp, and he stands up quickly from his crouch. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s out of the room in a flash, leaving Jimin wondering if he\u2019s dreamt the entire thing.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>On the evening of day sixty-seven, Jimin is so caught up in the drama he\u2019s watching by himself that he doesn\u2019t even acknowledge Yoongi hovering on the edges of the darkened living room. He finally notices when Yoongi speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d he asks tentatively. He fidgets where he stands.</p>\n<p>\u201cA drama,\u201d Jimin says, trying to stifle the emotion in his voice.</p>\n<p>Yoongi sounds like he\u2019s regretting his question before he asks it. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRomance,\u201d Jimin says, voice wobbly.</p>\n<p>And then, inexplicably, instead of turning around and leaving like he <em>always</em>does, Yoongi shuffles over and <em>sits down on the couch next to Jimin.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat woman looks familiar,\u201d Yoongi says after they watch together for a minute.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in a lot of things,\u201d Jimin says, clutching the throw pillow he\u2019s holding tight to his chest, and his voice finally breaks. \u201cShe\u2019s really good,\u201d he adds, practically sobbing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Yoongi says, \u201care you crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be together because of class differences and it\u2019s not <em>fair!\u201d</em> Jimin cry-shouts, hugging his pillow. </p>\n<p>Yoongi stays frozen, staring at Jimin. Jimin, on the other hand, stays staring at the characters onscreen, who are having their sad, long-winded goodbye on a very windy bridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf she didn\u2019t care so much about money then they could be happy forever!\u201d Jimin shrieks. There is almost definitely something coming out of his nose. \u201cWhy is she letting money stop her?! He\u2019s right there!\u201d Jimin plaintively stretches one arm out towards the television, grabbing like he can reach through the screen and push the characters together where they belong. </p>\n<p>Giving up, he slumps back, letting his arm fall.</p>\n<p>A second later, Jimin jolts at the feel of an arm wrapping around his shoulders, tugging him against a solid chest. </p>\n<p>Now Jimin\u2019s the frozen one.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Yoongi finally says in that low, soothing voice, and Jimin relaxes. He leans into Yoongi\u2019s hold and cries away, almost tearing his pillow from gripping it so hard.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you were a mythical creature, which would you be?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jimin fidgets where he\u2019s lounging beside Taehyung on his bed as he considers the question. He\u2019s past the point of finding this kind of thing from Taehyung strange. He just accepts it. \u201cUnicorn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that,\u201d Taehyung says. \u201cBut then I thought because it would be expected, you <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> pick it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d Jimin says, \u201cI thought that too. But that\u2019s exactly why I would choose it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung rolls over. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople would expect me to choose a unicorn. But that\u2019s why I <em>should</em> pick it,\u201d Jimin elaborates. \u201cJust because people expect it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true. If they don\u2019t stop to think about why it\u2019s true that I\u2019m a unicorn beyond the surface reasons, then that\u2019s their problem.\u201d Jimin makes finger guns at his best friend. \u201cI\u2019m too busy being a unicorn to care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung nods slowly like Jimin\u2019s just dispensed some major wisdom. </p>\n<p>\u201cAll unicorns like it up the butt, right?\u201d Taehyung asks after some silence, and Jimin shoves at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTae!\u201d he chastises, but it\u2019s hard not to laugh.</p>\n<p>Taehyung laughs too, but once he\u2019s calmed down, he looks down at his hands where they play with the edge of his pillow. \u201cI just want you to be happy,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Jimin might not know exactly what Taehyung is trying to tell him, but he does know exactly what situation Taehyung\u2019s talking about, because it\u2019s day seventy-one and Jimin doesn\u2019t have to count anymore to know off the top of his head what day they\u2019re on.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work out,\u201d Jimin says. Even though he\u2019s lost, he at least knows everything will work out.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Taehyung says, but it\u2019s serious, not derisive; when Jimin looks to his friend, Taehyung\u2019s expression is soft and affectionate.</p>\n<p>\u201cLoser,\u201d Jimin says lovingly.</p>\n<p>Taehyung slams him with a pillow. Jimin scampers out of the bed and steals Jeongguk\u2019s pillow off of his bed, and then it\u2019s <em>on.</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s on his way to shower on the evening of day seventy-three when he hears cursing from the hyungs\u2019 room.</p>\n<p>When he peeks his head in the door, he sees Yoongi standing in the middle of the otherwise unoccupied room, literally clutching at his hair. \u201cHyung?\u201d Jimin greets softly, shouldering his way past the door. </p>\n<p>Yoongi turns and drops his hands from his head when he sees Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d he greets. \u201cAm I being loud?\u201d</p>\n<p>Something\u2019s off. At the very least, Jimin can\u2019t recall Yoongi <em>ever</em> caring about whether or not his loudness was bothering anyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Jimin asks carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Yoongi answers immediately, curtly, but then he he looks down and takes a deep breath. \u201cJust, frustrated. Working on this song. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d He kicks at a spot on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks up, surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I can help,\u201d Jimin offers.</p>\n<p>Yoongi gives an awkward laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>can,\u201d</em> Jimin insists, slightly insulted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you can,\u201d Yoongi says back. He actually looks a little apologetic. \u201cThe problem is me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi wanders through the space of the room for a second before answering, like he\u2019s looking for his response behind a piece of furniture. \u201cI\u2019m not rapping well on this new round of songs,\u201d he confesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cSays the greatest rapper in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi suddenly seems really, really uncomfortable. He almost turns his back on Jimin when he moves to look away. \u201cCut it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cI\u2019m being a hundred percent honest. You\u2019re the greatest rapper in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks at the window. The blinds are shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Namjoon that,\u201d he finally says, his hands tucked deep into his pants pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin insists. \u201cI\u2019d pay you to rap the phone book.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi tries to hide it, but he cracks the tiniest smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet the fuck out of here, Jimin-ah,\u201d Yoongi says, but he looks so happy that Jimin doesn\u2019t mind. Jimin smiles unabashedly, proud of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d Jimin says on his way out, and Yoongi looks a bit surprised to hear it-- he must\u2019ve forgotten that Jimin hadn\u2019t set it yet today. For some reason, today, it feels really, really good to say it.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s phone buzzes with a new message from the other side of the dance practice room, near dusk on day seventy-seven. He\u2019s laying on the floor, sweaty and exhausted, his limbs splayed out. He\u2019d come in hours ago with Taehyung and Jeongguk, but they\u2019d long abandoned him for food and rest; Jimin had stayed, insisting that he still had some points to work out in the new routine. </p>\n<p><em>From: Yoongi,</em> his phone reads, after he\u2019s laboriously crawled across the floor to retrieve it. (No one is there to hear him moaning dramatically as he does it, but he moans dramatically anyway.) Yoongi has been texting him a lot lately, which is weird. The messages are never terribly important or anything, but Jimin doesn\u2019t want to question it, for fear of it going away. </p>\n<p><em>u still in the building</em> it says. Not even a question mark, Jimin notes with amusement. How Yoongi.</p>\n<p><em>yea was just about to head out.</em> Jimin sends. Then, <em>r u still here?</em></p>\n<p><em>yes,</em> he gets back a second later.</p>\n<p>Well. Alright then. Jimin flops back onto the floor. What a nice chat.</p>\n<p>The phone buzzes again a minute later. <em>come 2 the studio.</em></p>\n<p>Jimin wipes the sweat off his arms and neck and face and grabs his jacket on the way out.</p>\n<p>For some reason, he feels compelled to knock on the studio door when he gets there, which he\u2019s never done before. Maybe because of the time he busted in there and Yoongi cried and all that business. He knocks and enters when he hears something approximate to a \u2018come in\u2019 uttered in Yoongi\u2019s low voice.</p>\n<p>Jimin trudges in. \u201cHey.\u201d Yoongi grunts in response. \u201cBeen here all day?\u201d </p>\n<p>Before Yoongi can answer, Jimin stops in his tracks. \u201cHold on.\u201d The last time they\u2019d talked had been that morning; Jimin had wished him a happy day and chirped a quick \u201cI love you, hyung\u201d as he passed by Yoongi\u2019s room, where Yoongi was still laid out on his bed with an arm slung over his face. \u201cHow did you know I was in the building in the first place?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou were singing in the hallway earlier,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cLoudly,\u201d he adds after a pause.</p>\n<p>Jimin blushes. He had indeed been belting out Taeyang when he, Jeongguk, and Taehyung had been searching for bottles of water on this floor. Dance practice just got him loud and excited, he guesses. </p>\n<p>Jimin turns away to hide his flush and drops his sore body onto the couch. \u201cI was making music,\u201d he announces primly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo was I,\u201d Yoongi says, turning back to his computer. He seems a bit off, like maybe he\u2019s nervous about something. Yoongi doesn\u2019t have many nervous tics but Jimin can spot them all from a mile away. Like, right now, Yoongi is grinding the sole of his right shoe into the floor in tiny circles, and his left index finger is tapping out a rushed but steady rhythm against the desk he\u2019s seated at.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis\u2019s what I was working on,\u201d he announces, and without any further warning, he double-clicks and new music pours from the room\u2019s speakers. </p>\n<p>Jimin listens carefully. It\u2019s different from a lot of their previous tracks. In fact, it\u2019s different from most of what Jimin listens to. It\u2019s got that same hip hop feel that\u2019s their signature sound, but it unexpectedly alternates between very fast, thumping verses, and a slow, sinuous chorus. Jimin is surprised to hear Seokjin\u2019s light voice singing the winding chorus already in there, calling after a girl who he\u2019s constantly around but who is always out of reach. Her smile, her smell, her voice, they follow him even when they\u2019re apart. She hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, Seokjin pleads for her to understand; it\u2019s just that he\u2019s tortured knowing he can\u2019t have her. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s only one layer of Seokjin\u2019s voice, and the final version would probably give a chorus to each of their vocalists, but Jimin already loves the longing that Seokjin gives the lyrics. They listen to the whole track, three rap-less verses and Seokjin\u2019s floating endearments in the chorus, and then the song ends.</p>\n<p>But Jimin knows what he needs to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to hear your rap,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>He knows that Yoongi already has at least his own verse in mind, if not all of them. And Jimin doesn\u2019t really know one of Yoongi\u2019s songs until he hears the raps. If he can put that chorus and Yoongi\u2019s rap together, he knows he\u2019ll understand the song that Yoongi wants him to hear.</p>\n<p>Yoongi almost seems to blush (still an unbelievable sight to Jimin) and doesn\u2019t answer. But Jimin knows that needling won\u2019t help (even though he reeaalllyyyy wants to), so he sits and waits while Yoongi stares at the computer screen.</p>\n<p>Yoongi restarts the song, his way of acquiesing to the request, and they sit through the first verse, and the first chorus, and then the second verse, and then the second chorus, until the third section begins, because apparently Yoongi has saved his verse for last. Jimin is suprised by how nervous he feels waiting.</p>\n<p>The third verse hits and Yoongi launches into his rap headfirst, not looking at Jimin but also not reading from anything. He\u2019s already memorized it, Jimin realizes. The rap is neat and tight but it\u2019s filled with confused feelings, as he tells a girl that he wants her but he doesn\u2019t know how she feels about him, that she treats him well without seeing that he\u2019s trouble. <em>I\u2019m a bad boy, don\u2019t you know?</em> he raps, and Jimin shivers at his words. Yoongi\u2019s intensity is mesmerizing. <em>I guess you\u2019ll find out soon enough,</em> he finishes, but it sounds melancholy instead of seductive. </p>\n<p>They listen to Seokjin sing one more time, and then the song ends and they sit in silence.</p>\n<p>Yoongi is staring at him, Jimin realizes after a few seconds. He\u2019s waiting for some kind of response, a positive one.</p>\n<p>Jimin isn\u2019t even sure where to begin.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dance for this is gonna be awesome,\u201d Jimin finally bursts out, unable to contain his excitement. </p>\n<p>For the first time, Yoongi looks satisfied.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><em>i forgot to ask if u had a title in mind,</em> Jimin texts Yoongi from his own bed once he\u2019s left the other back at the studio and gotten back to the dorms.</p>\n<p>A moment later the little typing cloud pops up at the bottom of the screen. And then it disappears. And then it appears again. And then it disappears. And appears. And disappears. </p>\n<p>A full three minutes later, Yoongi sends a <em>not yet.</em> Somehow, Jimin knows that he\u2019s lying. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin and Yoongi stand beside each other at the kitchen sink doing dishes on day eighty. Jimin washes as Yoongi dries. </p>\n<p>It was actually just Jimin\u2019s turn to the dishes, but Yoongi had randomly volunteered to help. Something about them being together, though, is markedly different in Jimin\u2019s mind; somehow it\u2019s more relaxed, and comforting, than it\u2019s ever been. Jimin always used to have to fill the spaces between himself and Yoongi with words; now, suddenly, there\u2019s no need to talk.</p>\n<p>Jimin passes Yoongi a plate, and as he does it, he says softly for the first time that day, \u201cI love you, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks up at him from the plate he\u2019s just been handed with big, surprised eyes. Jimin stares back, feeling his face heat up. </p>\n<p>A second later they\u2019re back to washing and drying. When Jimin hands Yoongi the next dish to dry, though, Yoongi takes the dish with one hand and quickly reaches out and catches Jimin\u2019s hand with the other.</p>\n<p>Yoongi holds Jimin\u2019s hand like that, suspended over the space between the soapy sink and the dried dishes. Yoongi looks down at where they\u2019re connected. Jimin can\u2019t do anything but look at Yoongi\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>Their hand hold is incredibly awkward, and yet, Yoongi looks like maybe he\u2019s seeing something incredible there in the place where they\u2019re joined, like he can\u2019t believe whatever he sees there. And Jimin realizes that there\u2019s some feeling in the connection, something that alights within him, that makes him want to grip Yoongi\u2019s hand back, to hold it tighter and pull Yoongi even closer. </p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin begins carefully, scared by this reaction he\u2019s having to the touch. But he doesn\u2019t know what else to say.</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t even seem to hear. He just swipes at a bit of foam on Jimin\u2019s hand with his thumb. It feels like Yoongi is stroking Jimin\u2019s hand through the hand-hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-hyung,\u201d Jimin tries again, quieter this time. Yoongi\u2019s eyes finally snap to his. </p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d he says in his low voice, looking right at Jimin, and his eyes are dark, darker than Jimin\u2019s ever seen them. Jimin swallows. Yoongi seems to be moving closer, his face tilting forward, towards Jimin, and Jimin doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen but without even meaning to he\u2019s leaning forward too-- and then--</p>\n<p>\u201cTURN UP!\u201d Taehyung screams from down the hallway, and both Jimin and Yoongi jump five feet in the air. </p>\n<p>Jimin clasps a hand over his chest as he experiences a mini heart-attack.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud crashing sound, and then a pair of feet stomp down the hallway, closely chased by another pair. </p>\n<p>Some part of Jimin not scared witless registers that his other hand is tingling in the absence of Yoongi\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>Taehyung suddenly whips his head around the doorway to the kitchen. <em>\u201cTurn up!\u201d</em> he shouts at Jimin and Yoongi, right before Jeongguk\u2019s dark head of hair materializes behind him. Jeongguk yanks the older back by his shirt, into the hallway and out of Jimin and Yoongi\u2019s sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Taehyung shrieks. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything to anyone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave them alone!\u201d Jeongguk says, sounding harried. The maknae\u2019s struggle to drag Taehyung away from the kitchen makes a huge racket. \u201cYou come back here and clean up the fucking mess you made!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn up!\u201d Taehyung cries again.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough, enough with the \u2018turn up!\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn up!\u201d Taehyung sobs insistently. There\u2019s a loud scuffle as he presumably tries to escape Jeongguk\u2019s clutches at the end of the hall. \u201cTurn up, turn up, <em>turn up!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Jeongguk grunts in exertion, there are a few more loud noises, and then the door to one of the bedrooms slams shut. Taehyung\u2019s subsequent shouts are muffled through the wood.</p>\n<p>Jimin chokes on a laugh. He turns to Yoongi.</p>\n<p>The older is looking up at the ceiling like he\u2019s trying to understand how he reached this place in his life.</p>\n<p>When Yoongi breaks his gaze from the ceiling to eye Jimin, they share a brief look-- an understanding, Jimin thinks. Then they return to the dishes, the tension from earlier temporarily broken.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time do you leave tomorrow?\u201d Jimin asks on the evening of day eighty-one, settled on the floor beside Yoongi\u2019s open suitcase.</p>\n<p>\u201cSix,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, not looking very happy about it. He stuffs a shirt into his bag with much more force than necessary, and Jimin laughs. </p>\n<p>Tomorrow the group splits in two for a week of separate radio and variety appearances. Starting the next morning, Yoongi, Hoseok, Taehyung, and Jeongguk will head out and sleep away from the dorms, while Jimin and Namjoon and Seokjin stay and do interviews in the area. Jimin had felt like he needed to see Yoongi before the older left in less than ten hours, which lead him to Yoongi\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks at him. \u201cHow about you?\u201d He asks Jimin. \u201cLooking forward to a fun-filled week with leader and hyung?\u201d His tone is casual, but he peers up at Jimin inquisitively from under his bangs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimin says kind of meekly. </p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t press, he just keeps an eye on Jimin. Jimin looks back for a little while, but eventually he caves.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s just,\u201d he admits, \u201cwhat if it\u2019s, like, weird, because it\u2019s the two of them and me? Like, hyung and the leader and me? I\u2019ll say something weird and then they\u2019ll be like, \u2018oh, we\u2019re so smart and mature and tall, what is this kid doing here,\u2019 and then I\u2019ll just, <em>hyung,</em> what if I make a fool of myself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about? Making a fool of yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYes,\u201d</em> Jimin whines. \u201cWhat if I prove that I\u2019m just a baby.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yoongi shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a million interviews, Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>good</em> at interviews,\u201d Yoongi adds. It\u2019s so sincere that Jimin is knocked back by it. \u201cYou embarassing them? Joonie and hyung? If anything, those two need <em>you.\u201d</em> He cringes. \u201cThose awkward motherfuckers.\u201d </p>\n<p>He leans forward like he\u2019s telling a secret. \u201cHyung is bad enough as it is. And I watched Joonie cut his mouth on a <em>sandwich</em> the other day. <em>A sandwich.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t help but giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Yoongi adds, looking lighter at Jimin\u2019s laughter, \u201cand if any of them give you a hard time, just challenge them to a dance battle.\u201d He gives Jimin a gummy grin. </p>\n<p>Warmth spreads in Jimin\u2019s chest. A weird part of him wants to pretend like he hadn\u2019t already told Yoongi that he loved him that day, but he tries ot ignore it. Instead, he tells Yoongi to shut up and get back to packing.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, hyungs!\u201d Jimin pulls out a headphone in order to shush the other members. \u201cShh, hyungs, it\u2019s coming on!\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon and Seokjin both turn their heads to look at him, and then simultaneously roll their eyes and turn back. </p>\n<p>Jimin gives them his most plaintive expression. It\u2019s day eighty-four, and Yoongi, Jeongguk, Taehyung, and Hoseok are doing a radio interview while Jimin and Namjoon and Seokjin head to a variety appearance. Jimin has actually figured out how to tune in to a radio station on his phone while in the van, and he <em>would</em> be able to listen to the show and support his fellow members if it weren\u2019t for all the noise coming from the two giants seated in the row ahead of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d Seokjin says, slowly and condescendingly, \u201cwe\u2019ll just listen to it later. Or watch it online. It\u2019s fine, we\u2019re missing nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to listen to it <em>nooow,\u201d</em> Jimin whines, but then the opening notes of the show\u2019s theme song begin in one headphone. Jimin hastily plugs in the other, but not before catching another eye roll from Seokjin as the older turns back around in his seat.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk, Hoseok, Taehyung, and Yoongi all do their introductions, and then some requisite talking about the new album, discussing singles and how their sound has evolved. Jimin nods along and internally praises them for making the usually-boring interview script sound playful. Hoseok in particular keeps the discussion moving with his humor, and Jimin feels pride in his fellow members. (For good measure, he shoots a vindictive glare at the back of Namjoon\u2019s and Seokjin\u2019s heads.) </p>\n<p>Suddenly, the radio host announces that today he\u2019ll be asking the members about their ideal types. </p>\n<p>They\u2019ve all been asked before, time and time again, but for some reason, something drops in Jimin\u2019s stomach <em>this</em> time.</p>\n<p>Hoseok, of course, wants someone nice and pretty and funny <em>(boring,</em> Jimin decides to himself). Taehyung, of course, wants someone beautiful and adventurous and \u201cdifferent,\u201d and the host is wise enough not to question him on that last one. Jeongguk, of course, wants someone who \u201cchallenges to him,\u201d whatever that means (weirdo). And then--</p>\n<p>\u201cSuga?\u201d The host asks.</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t answer for what feels like forever.</p>\n<p>Then, hesitantly, Yoongi says, \u201cSweet.\u201d </p>\n<p>And then, he adds, \u201cCute.\u201d</p>\n<p>The convinction in his voice grows with each quality. \u201cKind. Optimistic. With a positive outlook. Nice to everyone, but with opinions, and maybe a little stubborn.\u201d He\u2019s on a roll now. \u201cCharming, and generous, and playful, and, and,\u201d he falters-- </p>\n<p>--and then, quietly, \u201cgreat.\u201d</p>\n<p>An awkward silence settles over the show. </p>\n<p>Jimin realizes his eyes are closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, basically,\u201d Jeongguk finally deadpans, \u201cthe opposite of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a pause, Hoseok guffaws; and then Jeongguk and Taehyung join in, and the host begins laughing with them. Eventually, even Yoongi\u2019s low laugh can be heard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYah, except for the stubborness!\u201d Hoseok suddenly blurts, and they all launch into an deconstruction of Yoongi\u2019s epic stubborn streak.</p>\n<p>Jimin opens his eyes and releases a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>At 11:38 that evening, Yoongi\u2019s name lights up the screen of Jimin\u2019s phone.</p>\n<p>For some reason, though he hadn\u2019t predicted it at all, Jimin feels in that moment like he\u2019s been waiting for the call the entire day. He presses the button to accept.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin greets.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d Yoongi returns. His lazy drawl feels like home. \u201cEvening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence. Jimin waits, fiddling with the hem of his shorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYah,\u201d Yoongi says suddenly. \u201cThe van was quiet without you complaining the whole way to the radio station. The others are loud, but god,\u201d he huffs dramatically, \u201ceven <em>those</em> three combined couldn\u2019t whine as loud as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t help but smile and hear the <em>I miss you</em> hidden in Yoongi\u2019s words. They won\u2019t see each other for another day and a half, and the dorm feels incredibly lonely with four missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well I felt so free in <em>our</em> van without a certain someone falling asleep on my lap,\u201d Jimin returns. \u201cSo much room to move around. Your head\u2019s so heavy.\u201d Jimin makes a straining sound like his body hurts just thinking about it. What he doesn\u2019t say is that he actually loves it when Yoongi falls asleep on his lap, even if it\u2019s only every now and then. It makes him feel special in a way that excites him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYah,\u201d Yoongi grouses again, but doesn\u2019t add anything; the obligatory <em>respect your elders, dongsaeng</em> and <em>don\u2019t mess with me, Park Jimin</em> are implied. Instead of speaking, they settle into a shared soundless space. </p>\n<p>Jimin sits with the phone to his ear, hearing nothing, but <em>knowing</em> that Yoongi is there. He\u2019s more sure of Yoongi being there he is of anything else in his life, and it\u2019s so overwhelmingly comforting. He wants to capture that assurance of Yoongi\u2019s presence; he wants to let it surround him; he wants soak in it until it soaks back into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI listened to the interview,\u201d Jimin hears himself say.</p>\n<p>The silence takes on a different quality.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Jimin can\u2019t read Yoongi\u2019s tone.</p>\n<p>Jimin nods even though Yoongi can\u2019t see him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d Yoongi says, his voice raspy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your ideal type?\u201d</p>\n<p>The question catches Jimin totally off guard. He swears he can hear his heart pound against his ribcage.</p>\n<p><em>Brilliant. Cynical. Hard-headed.</em> The words flood Jimin\u2019s head. <em>Talented. Obnoxious. Cranky.</em> They\u2019re there without him even having to think about it. <em>Gorgeous. Stubborn. Ridiculous. Incredible.</em></p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t say any of them. </p>\n<p>Instead, he just blurts out, \u201cshort,\u201d and then panics and hangs up the phone. </p>\n<p>Jimin looks down at the phone in his hand in horror, and then throws it across the room. </p>\n<p>A second later, he swears, and then runs across the room to retrieve it. He hits redial and curses himself and waits for it to be picked up and--</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah?\u201d Yoongi answers, sounding baffled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d Jimin rushes out, and then hangs up again.</p>\n<p>He chucks the phone to the other side of the room this time (now, to the opposite side from where he first threw it) just for good measure.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin knows when Seokjin has listened to the interview because he randomly shows up to just hang around and bother Jimin. </p>\n<p>So, on day eighty-six, Jimin looks towards the doorway while he\u2019s cleaning his room and finds Seokjin leaning against the frame, <em>smiling</em> at Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jimin greets awkwardly. <em>Can I help you?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seokjin asks, feigning confusion. \u201cWho, me?\u201d He splays a hand across his chest dramatically. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to bother you. I was just...standing here.\u201d He smiles at Jimin like he knows some secret. </p>\n<p>What\u2019s terrifying is that Jimin\u2019s pretty sure that if there is a secret, Seokjin is <em>definitely</em> the one who knows it. And there\u2019s almost no chance he\u2019s telling.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you like the others\u2019 interview?\u201d Seokjin asks. </p>\n<p>The other four have probably done three separate interviews together since they left, but they both know exactly which interview Seokjin\u2019s talking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cI liked it fine,\u201d Jimin mumbles. Whatever\u2019s going on in the air, whatever it is that makes him feel the way he does when he hears Yoongi\u2019s voice on the radio or over the phone or when they bump into each other just for a second in person, it\u2019s starting to really sink into Jimin in a way that makes it completely, undeniably real. Seojkin\u2019s notice of it only makes it terrifyingly more real.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn a totally unrelated note,\u201d Seokjin interrupts Jimin\u2019s thoughts, his tone suggesting that the note is actually very related, \u201chave you spoken to any of the other members since they left? Tae, Hobi, Gukkie,\u201d he makes a face of (probably fake) contemplation, \u201cYoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeeeeeees,\u201d Jimin answers honestly. Really early in the morning he\u2019d been awoken by a call-- something that would\u2019ve bothered him a lot more if it hadn\u2019t been specifically Yoongi. \u201cJimin-ah, we\u2019ve only got now,\u201d he\u2019d rushed out, surrounded by sounds of movement and quick voices, \u201cthat\u2019s it for the rest of the day,\u201d and Jimin in his half-asleep haze had luckily understood automatically, rushing out a scratchy \u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d and Yoongi had exhaled into the mouthpiece and said \u201cokay\u201d and then \u201cno, I\u2019m done\u201d to someone on his side and then \u201csorry\u201d to someone, Jimin wasn\u2019t sure to whom on which side of the call, and then finally \u201cgo back to sleep, Jimin-ah,\u201d and Jimin had obediently dropped his phone onto the mattress and sunk back into slumber.</p>\n<p>Seokjin smiles that smile again. He doesn\u2019t ask for details. He doesn\u2019t ask who of the four members Jimin talked to-- he just knows.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Jimin says, umprompted. \u201cEverything\u2019s normal, whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Seokjin agrees, and leaves.</p>\n<p>Jimin groans, falling onto his bed and faceplanting onto a pillow.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Namjoon, Seokjin, and Jimin sit in the dorm on the evening of day eighty-eight, waiting, when the other four finally return from their trip. Despite the fact that they spend literally all of their time together, Jimin knows that everyone still misses each other even when they\u2019re separated just for a day or two. There\u2019s something reassuring about going to bed knowing that every member is back home. </p>\n<p>Jimin is scrolling uselessly on his phone, laying back on the small couch; Seokjin and Namjoon are propped up against each other on the big couch, watching some idol-meets-baby show with twin blank expressions. Jimin kind of wants to memorialize their identical vacant stares with a photo, but knows he\u2019ll be in real trouble if he\u2019s caught. He\u2019s contemplating whether or not he can subtly film them on his phone while pretending to very passionately text when several pairs of feet can suddenly be heard shuffling outside the dorm\u2019s entrance. Voices quietly converse back and forth for a moment and a half, and then the front door opens.</p>\n<p>Immediately, Seokjin\u2019s and Namjoon\u2019s blank looks break; Seokjin brightens, Namjoon\u2019s expression relaxes; and Jimin snaps out of his reclining position to sit up. </p>\n<p>First Jeongguk, then Taehyung, then Hoseok trudge in with their duffels. Hoseok and Taehyung give big smiles, and though Jeongguk tries to cover it up, a tiny relieved grin shows through his tired-apathetic facade. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s the familiar sound of the members greeting each other, Namjoon asking how the trip was and how the interviews went, Seokjin fussing and asking if they took care of themselves, Tae and Hobi giving joke answers and saying generally weird things, and Jeongguk acting disinterested and trying to escape the conversation-- but all Jimin can think about is Yoongi, <em>where\u2019s Yoongi,</em> he doesn\u2019t see Yoongi at the back of the group, where is he?</p>\n<p>Only a few seconds later, Yoongi comes through the doorway, duffel in hand. Jimin feels nearly all of the tension inside of himself loosen at the sight. </p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes land on Jimin and he <em>smiles,</em> a small but beautiful smile. </p>\n<p>As if he can hear Jimin\u2019s internal questions, he explains with a smirk, \u201cleft my headphones in the van,\u201d and like he doesn\u2019t even see anyone else in the room, he walks right up to Jimin and drops his duffel.</p>\n<p>Yoongi keeps smiling; Jimin helplessly smiles back. </p>\n<p>Jimin is abruptly aware of the entire room going silent. </p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hit by a sense of <em>waiting.</em> Everyone\u2019s watching them, and everyone is waiting for something. </p>\n<p>He wants to turn around and look at the members and understand what it is they think they\u2019re going to see, but he doesn\u2019t dare break away from Yoongi\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>Nothing happens for a very long time, and then, maybe wonderfully, maybe completely frustratingly, or maybe both, Seokjin interrupts the moment with a bright, \u201cAlright, why don\u2019t we get you all back to your rooms and unpacked,\u201d and the moment breaks for everyone else, but Jimin can\u2019t help but notice that the moment continues for him and Yoongi; they\u2019re still looking at eachother, still sharing something, whatever it might be, after everyone else has already filtered out of the room, and they stand there for probably a full minute longer just looking at each other Yoongi eventually says, \u201cwe should too,\u201d and gestures towards the hallway and they both reluctantly begin to walk towards the bedrooms, and it\u2019s then that Jimin finally realizes that it\u2019s not a moment they\u2019re sharing, it\u2019s something much longer, something sustained, something that just can\u2019t be dismissed.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>That evening, they have a party.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s loud music (as loud as they can get away with inside the dorm) and a lot of food and plenty of alcohol, and everyone is in a fantastic mood. Jimin doesn\u2019t drink anything; he\u2019s already feeling buzzed from having all the members back home together again, and he\u2019s excitable enough as a person to get a contact high just from all the fun happening around him. Even the idea of a party gets him worked up, and soon he\u2019s dancing and singing and shrieking with laughter.</p>\n<p>He and Taehyung and Hobi are messing around in the middle of the living room, which they\u2019ve pushed all of the furniture to the perimeter of to make a dance floor. Hobi keeps doing girl group dances, and even though Jimin\u2019s seen him do it a million times, he\u2019s always undone by the facial expression that Hobi puts on when he does it. At a table pushed up against a wall, Jeongguk is attempting to sneak more alcohol than Seokjin\u2019s already cut him off at would, and doing a pretty poor job of covering it up. He isn\u2019t caught, though, because Seokjin and Namjoon are dancing together and are too caught up in it to pay attention to anything else. Jimin briefly observes them and decides that the two are unexpectedly good dancers <em>together</em> in light of how terrible they are separately, but he\u2019s quickly distracted from the sight by Hobi\u2019s enthusiastic rendition of <em>Lion Heart.</em> When Taehyung joins in with very little technique but a great deal of passion, Jimin has to stop dancing and bend over to try and catch his breath. </p>\n<p>When he looks up, he makes eye contact with Yoongi, who\u2019s seated in a kitchen chair wedged between the couches. His eyes are bright as he looks at Jimin. Jimin gets the feeling that maybe Yoongi\u2019s been watching him for awhile, but Yoongi\u2019s smirk indicates that he doesn\u2019t care if he\u2019s been caught staring. Jimin feels a thrill run through him at the thought.</p>\n<p>Jimin rushes over to Yoongi and, without thinking about it, seats himself right on Yoongi\u2019s lap. He loops his arms around the older\u2019s neck and settles in, swaying into him excitedly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHyung!\u201d He announces, too hopped up on the energy of the party to care who sees him or what they might think. Everyone\u2019s drunk and too distracted by the celebration to pay them any attention anyway, he tells himself. To his credit, Yoongi doesn\u2019t seem surprised at all; he practically welcomes Jimin\u2019s lap sitting, winding his arms around Jimin\u2019s waist and holding him in place. \u201cHow much have you had to drink, tell me honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks up into Jimin\u2019s face, his expression serene. \u201cNone,\u201d he answers.</p>\n<p>Jimin leans his torso against Yoongi\u2019s chest. \u201cYou liar,\u201d he teases, but he can believe it. Yoongi looks chill, but he seems alert enough; it\u2019s just Yoongi\u2019s regular chillness, Jimin guesses. \u201cThen what are you so happy about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi holds Jimin\u2019s gaze for a second, and then <em>sweeps</em> his gaze up and down Jimin\u2019s body in a way that leaves him feeling hot and shivery at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Yoongi says slowly, but he looks like he knows exactly. Their faces are close together again, like they seem to be so often these days. </p>\n<p>Jimin tightens his arms around Yoongi\u2019s neck. Yoongi moves his hands from Jimin\u2019s hips up to his waist. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you miss me while you were gone?\u201d Jimin whispers. He feels reckless, like he could do or say anything-- like he could melt right into Yoongi in this moment and it would feel so, <em>so</em> good.</p>\n<p>The corners of Yoongi\u2019s lip curl up. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tries to process this with his turnt up brain, but isn\u2019t sure he gets it completely, since after only a second of thought, Yoongi jostles him in his lap and drops his voice to a whisper too. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Their noses are almost touching. To prevent what would assuredly be a tragic, terrible collision, Jimin shifts to the side just a bit, so their noses are side by side, touching just a bit. Now the rest of their faces are closer together, too.</p>\n<p>Jimin should check the time on his phone or ask someone else in the room or something to answer Yoongi\u2019s question, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s already got his answer. \u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d he whispers back.</p>\n<p>Yoongi really does smile back this time. His eyes fall shut. He looks gorgeous.</p>\n<p>Right then, something crashes into them. Jimin yelps and clutches to Yoongi, who automatically tightens his hold on Jimin, chillness immediately obliterated.</p>\n<p>It turns out to have been a drunk Jeon Jeongguk, who has barreled straight into them, presumably while imitating a bull. Judging by the surprised expressions of the others-- aside from Hoseok, who is clutching his side in a fit of laughter-- everyone else is just as caught off guard. Seokjin\u2019s and Namjoon\u2019s dancing has halted, and Seokjin holds onto Namjoon\u2019s arm, looking over at Jeongguk with a mix of alarm and suspicion.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk is in a heap on the floor, his face smushed into Yoongi\u2019s knees. When he lifts his head, he\u2019s got a hazy smile on his face. Jimin knows he and Yoongi must be a sight-- Jimin seated atop Yoongi\u2019s lap, the two of them leaning away from Jeongguk and clutching to each other with bewildered expressions. Their expressions probably become even more priceless when Jeongguk\u2019s smile drops and he makes a face like he\u2019s about to hurl. </p>\n<p>Immediately Jimin feels himself being moved and then he\u2019s being lifted over and away from the hunched-over Jeongguk, and he realizes belatedly that he is being <em>carried</em> by Yoongi. He still hasn\u2019t wrapped his head around the situation by the time he\u2019s being deposited on his feet on the other side of the room.</p>\n<p>Jimin turns his head to try and catch what\u2019s happening with Jeongguk back by the couches, but he\u2019s already being pulled by his wrist out of the room and down the hallway by Yoongi. The last thing he catches is Seokjin stalking across the room towards Jeongguk like he means business, Namjoon belatedly chasing after Seokjin and making panicked \u201cwait, wait!\u201d gestures. </p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin says plaintively, but he doesn\u2019t really mind that much that he\u2019s being pulled away. Quickly, they\u2019re arrived at Jimin\u2019s room, and Yoongi gently, if hastily, guides Jimin to sitting on his own bunk. Jimin looks up to find Yoongi pacing before him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get caught up in that,\u201d he says, and Jimin mostly agrees. Though he would kind of like to see Jeongguk get in trouble with Seokjin-- but he could go back at any time and catch the ass-whooping. Right now, he\u2019s more interested in what\u2019s got Yoongi so worked up. </p>\n<p>Yoongi pauses and then, inexplicably, drops to his knees in front of Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d Yoongi chastises, his voice rough, \u201cwhy are you wearing your shoes in the dorm? Come on.\u201d He starts to untie and remove Jimin\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p>Jimin is deeply confused, butsome part of his mind says, <em>just go with it, why complain when this is actually kind of nice?,</em> so he doesn\u2019t say anything. Meanwhile, Yoongi tugs off Jimin\u2019s shoes with what are at first jerky, and then careful and slow, movements.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking Jeon Jeongguk,\u201d Yoongi mutters under his breath, and Jimin laughs. Yoongi looks up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d Jimin says affectionately. </p>\n<p>Yoongi looks down and attends to Jimin\u2019s socks as well, which is actually kind of unnecessary, but Jimin doesn\u2019t complain. He likes the feel of Yoongi\u2019s hand gently cupping his bare foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jimin says, smiling, \u201cwhat about a foot rub?\u201d He kicks his foot a bit in Yoongi\u2019s grip. When Yoongi doesn\u2019t respond, Jimin whines and kicks his foot again.</p>\n<p>Yoongi scowls. \u201cYou\u2019re spoiled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who spoils me,\u201d Jimin complains back.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s face changes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserve the best,\u201d he murmurs to the floor. \u201cOnly the absolute best for you, Pa--\u201c inexplicably, he cuts himself off, \u201c--Jimin-ah.\u201d He locks eyes with Jimin. \u201cOnly the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keeping eye contact, Yoongi leans forward and rests the side of his face against Jimin\u2019s knee. His gaze burns through Jimin.</p>\n<p>Jimin reaches a hand forward to touch Yoongi\u2019s face, but before he can reach it, someone rushes into the doorway, talking rapidly.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHyung,</em> you gotta get out there, they\u2019re gonna-- oh,\u201d Hoseok, with a confused look, halts himself. \u201cSorry, am I-- am I interrupting something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok asks the question totally respectfully, not suggestively or rudely, at all and Jimin\u2019s reflex is to say <em>of course not,</em> but he can\u2019t help but think, <em>yes, you are.</em> Yoongi, on the other hand, glares at Hoseok from where his head is still pillowed on Jimin\u2019s knee. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Hoseok says. \u201cRight. Uh, there\u2019s a rap battle about to begin out there, Namjoon and Jeongguk and me, and I said I would come get you.\u201d He looks unsure as he says it, like he realizes he\u2019s being disruptive.</p>\n<p>Yoongi sighs and closes his eyes. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says to Hoseok. \u201cGimme a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Hoseok repeats back nervously, and then he\u2019s gone from the room.</p>\n<p>Yoongi gives Jimin a final look before he pulls himself up from the ground with a groan. \u201cI gotta get out there,\u201d he says, sounding not very excited about it. He turns to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung.\u201d Jimin catches Yoongi\u2019s wrist, and Yoongi turns back. \u201cDon\u2019t be too rough on them, okay? Just try to to have a good time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi stares for a moment and then turns. As he moves away, though, he links pinkies with Jimin. It feels like he\u2019s reluctant to let go when he does.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>In the early afternoon of day eighty-nine, Yoongi shuts the door behind him and is immediately pelted in the head by a balled-up pair of socks.</p>\n<p>Yoongi freezes, a scrunched-up expression stuck on his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cHYUNG!\u201d Jimin shrieks. \u201cHyung, come over to my side! HYUNG!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi opens his eyes to locate Jimin, who\u2019s peering from his crouch behind his pillow and couch barricade. </p>\n<p>\u201cDON\u2019T DO IT!\u201d Taehyung screeches from the other side, and Yoongi jolts. He glances at Taehyung\u2019s side, then looks back to Jimin.</p>\n<p>Jimin makes his most desperate puppy eyes possible.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the room, where Taehyung is, stands another (Jimin can admit it) far superior barricade; it\u2019s composed of several pieces of furniture, adorned by sheets and way more pillows-- it\u2019s basically a militarized blanket fort. Jimin\u2019s single-couch defense is pitiful in comparison.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes dart back and forth between the barricades for a moment, and then he rushes over to Jimin\u2019s side. He slides into place on the floor beside Jimin. Jimin punches the air triumphantly at the arrival of an ally.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Yoongi opens as Jimin frantically balls up more orphan socks into bombs.</p>\n<p>\u201cTae and Guk doing laundry,\u201d Jimin explains. \u201cAnd then Hoseok went to \u2018help\u2019 them with folding...\u201d Yoongi rolls his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi!\u201d Hoseok shouts from the other fort. \u201cYou traitor! How could you pick Minnie\u2019s side!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Namjoon-hyung were here he would be on my side!\u201d Jimin shouts back, though he\u2019s not so sure about that. He\u2019s actually pretty confident the leader would pick his side based on wherever Seokjin was. It\u2019s actually a good thing neither Namjoon nor Seokjin are here--Namjoon didn\u2019t come back with Yoongi from the studio-- so they couldn\u2019t disprove Jimin\u2019s statement. </p>\n<p>Without warning, two more bombs are lobbed at Jimin and Yoongi. Jimin curses.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do they have three and you\u2019re by yourself?\u201d Yoongi asks suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might\u2019ve said something about being able to take them all on by myself...\u201d Jimin mumbles. He shamefully looks away and balls up more pairs of socks.</p>\n<p>Yoongi sighs. \u201cThis isn\u2019t looking too good for you,\u201d he announces. \u201cI mean, they have a whole <em>blanket fort.</em> I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot with that attitude we\u2019re not!\u201d Jimin scolds. He stands and quickly throw three sock bombs in a row, then drops back down into his crouch. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, one of the bombs seems to hit Hoseok. \u201cAh, shit!\u201d he calls, and there\u2019s a loud thump as something-- probably Hoseok-- hits the floor. \u201cRight in the eye! Goddammit, Park Jimin!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHOBI,\u201d Taehyung announces dramatically, \u201cHOBI-HYUNG, DON\u2019T LET GO! DON\u2019T GIVE IN! NO, HOBI, I WILL AVENGE YOU!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201dWhere</em> is hyung,\u201d Yoongi asks with some desperation.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrocery store!\u201d Jimin cheers, peeking out from the side of the couch. Immediately, Jeongguk delivers a war cry and lobs a suspiciously large sock bomb at Jimin. Jimin shrieks and ducks back behind his barricade.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome out here, you wimps!\u201d Taehyung shouts, following up Jeongguk\u2019s attack with, inexplicably, a banana.</p>\n<p>Yoongi eyes the banana as it lands with a <em>thump</em> between him and Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cSustenance!\u201d Jimin declares, tucking the banana away under a pillow.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes close. </p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, when Seokjin-eomma shows up,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Jimin scoffs. \u201cHyung.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yoongi cracks an eye open, and Jimin leans forward conspiratorally. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>at least</em> ten minutes from now.\u201d He lets a mischevious grin break out on his face.</p>\n<p>After a pause, Yoongi gives a mischevious grin to match. </p>\n<p>Yoongi is so close, and his smile is so genuinely sweet. Jimin\u2019s heart beats faster just at the sight of it. It\u2019s day eighty-nine and he\u2019s already told Yoongi he loved him, and he wonders what would happen if he were to just reach out, to just put his hand on Yoongi\u2019s chest and rest it there. What would Yoongi do? How would he react?</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes suddenly move to a sock bomb at his side. He picks it up and contemplatively tosses it up and down a few times. Then, he looks to Jimin.</p>\n<p>Jimin nods, picking up as many sock bombs as he can with both hands.</p>\n<p>On the silent count of three, they attack.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d Namjoon tells them in the evening of day ninety-one.</p>\n<p>The members, all sprawled across the practice room floor panting, collectively groan. </p>\n<p>\u201cTen minutes!\u201d Taehyung demands dramatically, spread out like a starfish next to Jimin. \u201cTen minutes of peace, please!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d Namjoon concedes. The declaration is met with unenthusastic cheers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna sleeeeep,\u201d Jimin whines. He stretches out across the floor where he lies, then reaches for the hem of his shirt and pulls it up over his head. Maybe if he can\u2019t see anyone, they can\u2019t see him, and he can just fall asleep right where he is and wake up in twelve hours.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s sharp voice interrupts Jimin\u2019s musings. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hyung,\u201d Jimin murmurs from below his shirt.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHyung,\u201d</em> Jeongguk says, exasperated. \u201cGet your shirt off your head and take the waterbottle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin reluctantly lowers his shirt a little bit to peer at Jeongguk suspiciously. \u201cWhy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be nice,\u201d Jeongguk says sarcastically. Jimin accepts the bottle and drinks from it, then splashes some of it on his face and goes to pull the shirt back over his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut your abs away,\u201d Jeongguk scoffs, before moving over to distribute a water bottle to Taehyung. </p>\n<p>Jimin makes a face back and lowers his shirt. As he reaches for his water again, he catches sight of Yoongi, leaning against the mirrored wall, gazing in Jimin\u2019s direction like he\u2019s caught in a trance.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t respond.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHyung.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s head snaps up. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d He sounds and looks dazed. It\u2019s pretty endearing. Jimin does a quick check in his head: he\u2019d already told Yoongi he loved him at lunch. But he feels almost a compulsion to say it again in this moment. Jimin almost has to hold the words in his mouth to keep them from escaping.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you daydreaming about?\u201d he asks instead.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s cheeks tinge pink. \u201cWhere\u2019s my water,\u201d he says, and he abruptly stands up and chases after Jeongguk.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It\u2019s day ninety...ninety-four, or maybe now it\u2019s ninety-five, Jimin isn\u2019t sure. He\u2019s so tired that he can\u2019t remember as he trudges into the dorm near midnight to a dark and quiet dorm.</p>\n<p>Except that there\u2019s someone up. Yoongi is sitting on the living room couch, watching the television on mute. Jimin is convinced that he must be pretty tired to have imagined Yoongi\u2019s eyes lighting up when he notices Jimin enter. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Yoongi greets. The television is the only light in the room, and its washed-out blue light reflects off of Yoongi\u2019s pale skin and leaves aqueous shapes on the couch space next to him.</p>\n<p>Jimin makes his way to the couch and then collapses onto it beside Yoongi, inarticulately moaning the woes of a six-hour dance practice. Yoongi lets out a strangled laugh and looks to Jimin as they recline next to each other. </p>\n<p>Seokjin had looked at Jimin like Seokjin knew a secret; Yoongi looks at Jimin like <em>Jimin</em> has the secret-- like Jimin has all the answers. Jimin is strangely uncomfortable on the receiving end of that gaze, wanting to both squirm away from and bask in it. The look is almost optimistic, in a way that Yoongi rarely ever seems to be, and Jimin feels deep pleasure at the sight of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tiiiiiired,\u201d Jimin hears himself whine, and tries to make himself comfortable in some position. Yoongi rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPark Jimin, you make everything so difficult for yourself,\u201d he chides, but there\u2019s no bite to the words. \u201cHere, just--\u201d with a hand, Yoongi gently guides Jimin\u2019s head down into his lap. </p>\n<p>Jimin goes with it, closing his eyes and feeling like his insides are flipping upside down, but also so tired that he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s imagining this entire interaction. He could have fallen asleep on the practice room floor and is now dreaming this up for all he knows.</p>\n<p>Dream or not, Yoongi\u2019s lap is warm and comfortable, and Jimin rubs his cheek against Yoongi\u2019s denim-clad thighs. A second later, his snapback is carefully removed from his head, and fingertips are slowly pushing through his hair.</p>\n<p>Jimin makes a noise of pleasure, and the fingers still for a second, and then start up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin murmurs after a little while longer, right on the edge of sleep, and Yoongi makes a noise of acknowledgement. Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he admits, \u201cI can\u2019t remember if I said it today.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fingers stop again, and Jimin feels muted embarassment wash over him. He\u2019s so tired, he doesn\u2019t even remember what he had for lunch or breakfast, or really anything before dance practice-- and now it\u2019s close to midnight. He wonders if he\u2019s in trouble when Yoongi doesn\u2019t answer immediately. Did he not tell Yoongi he loved him today and it\u2019s already too late, past midnight? Did he actually miss a day? He begins to get anxious, scared in his lethargic state that he\u2019s carelessly thrown the entire challenge away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Yoongi finally responds quietly, and Jimin breathes a sigh of relief. He can\u2019t remember it, but he trusts Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you can say it again,\u201d Yoongi tacks on. </p>\n<p>Jimin feels confusion, but when he thinks about it for a second, he realizes that he <em>does</em> want to say it again, even if doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> to.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you hyung,\u201d he says quietly, and he wonders if he imagines Yoongi releasing a saved-up breath too. </p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s fingers continue to card through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-hyung,\u201d Jimin says, the last thing to say, as he feels himself fading into sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, baby?\u201d Yoongi asks. Jimin wishes wishes <em>wishes</em> he\u2019s not imagining, that he\u2019s still awake and every moment of this is real.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is the TV on mute?\u201d But then he drops straight into sleep, and doesn\u2019t get to hear the answer.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of their last variety appearances before this round of promotions finishes, on day ninety-six, and Jimin is secretly a bit thankful. He thinks they all might be, actually; the group is tired, as they always are by this point, and they deserve some rest. Variety can feel like a performance, especially when they have to be prepped backstage before the show starts, getting directions first from management and then from Namjoon about what they\u2019ll be doing and saying.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s limited seating in this backstage room. Coordi noonas and crew members bustle around them in the prep area, and the other members are practically piled on top of each other on the one couch that\u2019s available. </p>\n<p>Jimin spots Seokjin getting up from the couch to get his makeup done-- but then Hoseok steals the empty seat before Jimin can. Sighing, Jimin resigns himself to standing next to the couch as their leader delivers his pre-show encouragement and instructions.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come Seokjin-hyung doesn\u2019t have to sit here and listen to this?\u201d Jimin interrupts partway in, crossing his arms. \u201cDoes he know everything about interviews already?\u201d He\u2019s aware that he sounds petulant, but he doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Seokjin-hyung,\u201d Namjoon chides. Jimin scoffs.</p>\n<p>Hoseok rolls his eyes and pulls on one of Jimin\u2019s arms to draw him closer. Jimin follows along, confused. Once Jimin\u2019s close enough, Hoseok yanks on the back belt loop of Jimin\u2019s pants and sends Jimin falling into Yoongi\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Hoseok says gruffly, returning his attention to Namjoon as Yoongi and Jimin both squawk indignantly. </p>\n<p>Apparently no one cares about their protests, so Jimin gives up and tiredly concedes to the seating arrangement. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a foreign experience, to sit on the lap of one of the members. And, a voice in the back of his head that sounds suspiciously like Seokjin reminds him, he did sit on Yoongi\u2019s lap at the party after the four members came home from promotions. Not that that\u2019s anything to note, not that sitting in Yoongi\u2019s lap is ever a big deal anyway.</p>\n<p>He settles in, and Yoongi follows suit, shutting up and craning his head around Jimin\u2019s side to see Namjoon.</p>\n<p>Everything\u2019s fine until Jimin tries to adjust so that he\u2019s actually actually sitting up straight in Yoongi\u2019s lap. The movement makes him suddenly conscious of the warmth of Yoongi\u2019s body beneath him-- of the press of Yoongi\u2019s chest to Jimin\u2019s back. At the same moment that Jimin realizes it, Yoongi seems to, and freezes beneath him. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a static moment, where neither of them move, and it\u2019s like no one else is in the room. It\u2019s just the two of them, breaths held in, waiting for something unknown to happen. </p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s hand makes it way onto Jimin\u2019s thigh <em>slowly</em> and rests there casually.</p>\n<p>Unable to sit still, Jimin shifts in Yoongi\u2019s lap just a little, maybe a centimeter to the side, slowly, slowly, <em>slowly.</em></p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s legs shifts beneath him, slowly, as well.</p>\n<p>Jimin lets his weight press into Yoongi\u2019s body, settling in. Then, Jimin shimmies a bit.</p>\n<p>Without warning, he\u2019s dumped onto the lap of Hoseok.</p>\n<p>Hoseok startles, and Jimin gasps and then chokes out an \u2018excuse me!\u2019, but Yoongi is already up and moving. He rapidly walks away from the couch in an unannounced direction, perhaps faster than Jimin\u2019s ever seen him walk, and succesfully disappears from the room in less than four seconds.</p>\n<p>Namjoon stands and looks after Yoongi with confusion. \u201cWhat...\u201d he begins, then gives up. \u201cWhat?\u201d he turns to the other members, searching for an explanation.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the group\u2019s questions, Jimin decides to disappear as well.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Yoongi is sitting on Jimin\u2019s bunk when he gets back to his room at the end of the day. Technically it\u2019s day ninety-seven now; Jimin is thankful that he hadn\u2019t waited until the end of ninety-six to tell Yoongi he loved him, considering that the older was basically ghosting out on everyone after the variety appearance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yoongi apologizes before Jimin can even open his mouth to ask why he\u2019s there.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Jimin asks, surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing a fuckboy today,\u201d Yoongi says. He stands up from the bunk. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p>\n<p>He\u2019s all business, and Jimin doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever heard Yoongi say sorry that many times in the span of even a year. He also hears the echoes of Yoongi\u2019s words from the party, from their time together in this same room, at the same bunk, just days ago: <em>You deserve the best. Only the absolute best for you, Jimin-ah.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat was yesterday,\u201d Jimin corrects. \u201cAnd I love you. hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi cringes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi,\u201d Jimin begins, but the older walks right past him to leave the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Yoongi says as he slips out the room.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks at the empty doorway, helpless.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Something\u2019s off when Jimin catches Yoongi in the kitchen in the early morning of day ninety-eight. For one, Yoongi\u2019s up and awake before 8 am. But he\u2019s also completely out of it, sitting at the table and staring at nothing, looking even paler than usual.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin says. It\u2019s just the two of them in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks at Jimin. His eyes are rimmed red, but his expression is totally blank.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, hyung,\u201d Jimin whispers.</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks away. </p>\n<p>He stands up and, wordlessly, hands Jimin his cell phone. </p>\n<p>Jimin looks down at the phone. Nothing seems out of the ordinary with it. He looks back up just in time to catch Yoongi walking out of the apartment, no keys, no jacket, just going straight out the door.</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t see him for the entire rest of the day.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Day ninety-nine hits.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost there-- Jimin\u2019s almost done it. One more day-- well, two more days, technically, but day one-hundred is when they return to the show. One more day in the dorms, telling Yoongi he loves him, and then that\u2019s it. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s it.</p>\n<p>They see each other at breakfast, but don\u2019t interact. Jimin spends his morning and then early afternoon in vocal and then dance practice; Yoongi is somewhere else, undisclosed. They\u2019re in the same room again at a late lunch back at the dorm, but Taehyung and Jeongguk and Namjoon are there, and it feels wrong to have any sort of exchange in front of the group, so nothing happens. Jimin has to admit, though, that he has no idea what this apparently inevitable exchange will entail. All he knows is that something is going to happen, something <em>has</em> to happen, and apparently everyone else knows it too, because Namjoon ushers Taehyung and Jeongguk out of the room a little before they\u2019re really done cleaning up from eating, and Jimin knows that it has to be for the sake of allowing Yoongi and Jimin to be alone together.</p>\n<p>But once it\u2019s just the two of them, nothing happens. They both sit there in silence, not looking at each other, for a while, until Seokjin calls Jimin\u2019s name from across the dorm and threatens him to clean his room. By the time Jimin\u2019s escaped his hyung\u2019s threats, he can\u2019t find Yoongi anywhere in the dorm.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>At 10:23 pm, Jimin gets a call. He knows who it is before he looks at the phone.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yoongi.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin greets.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d Yoongi says, and his words come out slowly, like he\u2019s carefully selecting them. \u201cCome to the studio.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin says back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to play that song for you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The explanation wasn\u2019t necessary-- Jimin would have gone back to the building as Yoongi requested without needing a reason-- but he knows exactly what song Yoongi is talking about, and the knowledge makes his heart slam agains this chest.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s nervous the entire way to the building, trying to figure out how to non-awkwardly tell Yoongi he loves him once he gets to there. He doesn\u2019t come up with anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cEy,\u201d Yoongi greets as he opens the door to the studio, but before Jimin can even settle into the discomfort of them sharing a space, Yoongi\u2019s ushering him in and speaking quickly. \u201cListen, listen to it,\u201d he orders, pointing Jimin to sit in a second chair next to the computer-- there was only one chair before, did Yoongi bring that in for Jimin?-- \u201clisten to the song, there\u2019s something wrong with it, there\u2019s something missing. You need to tell me without missing.\u201d He double-clicks to play the song and then drops himself into the chair beside Jimin\u2019s like he means business.</p>\n<p>A puzzle-- Jimin loves puzzles. It\u2019s perfect, the best distraction to get both of their minds off of the awkwardness and allow them to work together in peace for a little while.</p>\n<p>The song is nearly done being recorded and mixed, and Jimin can hear the voices of every other member in it. Hoseok and Namjoon rap, Hoseok forlorn and Namjoon passionately, and Seokjin and Taehyung and Jeongguk all get their own choruses. The only voice he doesn\u2019t hear is his own, and when did Yoongi get everyone to record these parts? </p>\n<p>\u201cYour chorus is the last one,\u201d Yoongi explains, breaking Jimin from his thoughts. \u201cSo that\u2019s missing. But otherwise, I don\u2019t know, something\u2019s not right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa whoa whoa,\u201d Jimin says, \u201cI missed your verse, I wasn\u2019t paying attention. Let me listen to your part again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks slightly reluctant, but he clicks to replay his verse anyway, and Jesus, it sounds so good, Jimin <em>knew</em> Yoongi\u2019s verse would sound incredible, what was Yoongi so worried about?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Jimin says. His voice comes out soft. \u201cI knew it would be beautiful. This song is amazing. I love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he turns, Yoongi is looking right at him. Their gazes are locked until Yoongi coughs suddenly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it missing,\u201d he reminds Jimin, and Jimin snaps back to attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me listen to it again,\u201d he says, clicking to replay the song.</p>\n<p>Jimin hates to say it, but by his third listen, he realizes Yoongi\u2019s right-- the song is missing something, a beat or sound missing here or there. The groundwork is laid, Jimin decides, but an element has to be added-- another sound effect to join the rhythm? Add a harmony to the bridge? Should some of them duet the choruses instead of do them alone?</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung!\u201d Jimin\u2019s struck by an idea. \u201cWhat if we layered our voices for that part? Like, yours and mine together-- me singing, you rapping?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi stares at him.</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t contain his excitement. \u201cLike, the contrast would be so great! Have we ever done that before, hyung? I don\u2019t remember. No, it doesn\u2019t matter! Just, just give it a try. Here, rap part of the verse. Or, just rap starting with the second line.\u201d Jimin looks to Yoongi expectantly. </p>\n<p>Yoongi continues to stare back.</p>\n<p>Why isn\u2019t Yoongi as excited about this as he is? This is an awesome idea. \u201cHere,\u201d Jimin decides. Yoongi, apparently frozen, doesn\u2019t even flinch as Jimin reaches across him to double-click the computer\u2019s mouse. </p>\n<p>The song starts playing, and Jimin fast-forwards to just before Yoongi\u2019s verse. As the rough drawl begins, Jimin counts along, waiting for inspiration to hit.</p>\n<p>He feels it right before the words come around-- <em>I\u2019m a bad boy, don\u2019t you know?</em>-- and Jimin gears up, aiming for high notes. The line hits, and Jimin sings as sweetly as he can over it. It\u2019s Yoongi\u2019s gravelly take plus Jimin\u2019s honey one-- <em>I\u2019m a bad boy, don\u2019t you know?</em>-- and it\u2019s perfect, totally perfect, together they\u2019re exactly as amazing as Jimin had known they\u2019d be.</p>\n<p>Yoongi is still looking at him, but this time it\u2019s incredulous, like he can\u2019t even believe Jimin exists.</p>\n<p>Jimin gets a bit nervous. Maybe he\u2019s totally offended Yoongi by defiling his song. He doesn\u2019t let himself give up quite yet, though. Maybe Jimin just picked the wrong line, maybe he can still convince Yoongi, the song is still playing, he\u2019s got another chance-- and he feels that pull as the last line of the rap approaches. <em>I guess you\u2019ll find out soon enough.</em> Jimin sings the words, letting his high voice soar over Yoongi\u2019s low one. <em>I guess you\u2019ll find out soon enough</em>-- Jimin\u2019s eyes slip closed as he sings, falling into the words. </p>\n<p>The verse finishes and the chorus begins again, tying up the end of the song, and Jimin keeps his eyes shut, feeling the song seep into him, finally understanding it, <em>finally</em> hearing what Yoongi had written.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s a pair of lips pressing against his own, warm and firm. </p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t help but gasp in surprise, and his eyes fly open and it\u2019s Yoongi, it\u2019s Yoongi, of course it\u2019s Yoongi, who else would it be? It\u2019s Yoongi, who pulls back and looks part surprised by his own actions, but also part intense, determined, with his dark, dark eyes zeroed in on Jimin\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin-ah,\u201d Yoongi murmurs in the lowest voice Jimin\u2019s ever heard out of him. He says the name like it\u2019s a revelation. \u201cJimin. <em>Jimin.\u201d</em> His eyes still trained on Jimin\u2019s lips, he leans back in.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin squeaks, just before Yoongi\u2019s mouth is again pressing against his own.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes close once more and immediately he loses himself in the sensation, in the heat of it, in the slow shift of Yoongi\u2019s lips against his own. Softly, carefully, Yoongi repositions his lips again Jimin\u2019s again and again, pressing his lips here and there, softly, softly.</p>\n<p>Jimin feels brave and finally presses his lips back against Yoongi\u2019s, moving slightly away and back again, and something picks up within Yoongi. His arms suddenly encirle Jimin, drawing their bodies together. </p>\n<p>Yoongi moves his mouth away to press his lips to Jimin\u2019s cheek and jaw. \u201cJimin,\u201d he says, his gaze so dark that he looks to be in a trance, \u201cwhen we fought-- that one time--\u201c he kisses right at the space below Jimin\u2019s ear and Jimin inhales sharply-- \u201cyou said, you told me not to say it--\u201c He sets his teeth lightly against Jimin\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay what, say what,\u201d Jimin asks breathlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour name--\u201c Yoongi nips at Jimin\u2019s lips. And as if Jimin himself didn\u2019t know it, \u201cJimin--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jimin gasps back, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it, say it, say it--\u201c</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s arms tighten around him. \u201cPark Jimin,\u201d he rasps into Jimin\u2019s ear. </p>\n<p>Something picks up within Jimin as well, and he\u2019s crushing their mouths together. Yoongi kisses back with just as much fervor, and when he leans closer to Jimin, they tip out of their chairs and onto the floor.</p>\n<p>Jimin squawks as they crash onto the floor with a loud thump, Jimin\u2019s chair clattering to the ground beside them. Jimin barely feels the impact of hitting the floor beneath him, because they\u2019re still wrapped around each other, and Yoongi lands on top of Jimin, his weight a welcome, burning pressure against Jimin\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jimin says, because what the everloving fuck is happening right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Yoongi says. His eyes are still so dark, face right up in Jimin\u2019s, their noses almost touching.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jimin repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you,\u201d Yoongi says again. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the floor,\u201d Jimin says. He thinks he\u2019s in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe song,\u201d Yoongi continues. \u201cI wrote the song for you. About you. I didn\u2019t know what to do, I just realized partway into the challenge thing that I had been into you for like a million years, but then I was like, oh my god, Yoongi, you fucking loser, he\u2019s never going to want you too, what are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tries to say something but all that comes out is a choked-off noise. Yoongi\u2019s on a roll now, talking like he\u2019s not also lying on top of Jimin on the floor with their arms wrapped around each other, their faces inches apart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to do something, so I wrote the song, but it didn\u2019t fix anything, it just made me realize that I was in love with you, and now I\u2019m in love with you and I don\u2019t know what to do--\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat--\u201c Jimin doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever heard Yoongi speak this much at once outside of a rap, and also none of it makes sense. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re never going to want me back and I\u2019m such a fool, you\u2019re a much better human being than I am, jesus, what was I thinking--\u201c</p>\n<p><em>\u201dYoongi,\u201d</em> Jimin says, and Yoongi finally shuts up. \u201cYoongi, what are you talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, you\u2019ve got it wrong,\u201d Jimin is so embarassed and this is so backwards. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi only looks confused, so Jimin fills him in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the one, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s in love with you and you\u2019re the one who isn\u2019t interested,\u201d Jimin confesses. His cheeks burn.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yoongi says slowly, \u201cthat\u2019s me. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s in love with you and doesn\u2019t have a shot.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then it hits Jimin and dear lord, they\u2019re <em>both</em> losers, what is wrong with them?</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi,\u201d Jimin says, and he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s saying this, \u201cwe\u2019re both in love with each other and were too sure we\u2019d get rejected to say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes go wide. He draws his head back as he absorbs this new information.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still on top of Jimin. Jimin\u2019s hands are still clutching Yoongi\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to be with me?\u201d Jimin blurts, embarassed.</p>\n<p>Yoongi breaks from his reverie and locks eyes with Jimin. His expression is totally serious. \u201cI want to marry you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says meekly. He feels his cheeks heat up.</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t break eye contact, doesn\u2019t smile, doesn\u2019t halt and laugh at Jimin and reveal that his confession is all some elaborate joke. He really, actually means it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat, uh, that doesn\u2019t sound so bad,\u201d Jimin finally says, which is kind of an epic understatement.</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks unbelievably relieved. </p>\n<p>\u201cPark Jimin,\u201d he says in that voice, in <em>that voice,</em> but he doesn\u2019t say anything else, he just tightens his arms around Jimin and leans in to kiss him again. It\u2019s soft, chaste, sweet, a light touch, but it carries every statement, every feeling, every reassurance that Jimin hopes for, needs. Jimin tries to communicate the same thing back with his kiss. <em>Only the best for you, Jimin-ah.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>If I deserve the best, then it\u2019s you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jimin says for what must be the three-hundredth time when they break apart some time later. \u201cYoongi. Yoongi. Tomorrow is day one hundred.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi halts. \u201cIt\u2019s not tomorrow already, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Trying not to displace Yoongi from on top of him, Jimin squirms and reaches for his phone in his pants pocket. Once he gets it, though, he turns it so that the screen faces Yoongi.</p>\n<p>Yoongi reads it. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he says, a beautiful smile blooming across his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, Yoongi,\u201d Jimin says, reveling in the feeling; a completely new and unique sentence, all his own.</p>\n<p>Yoongi kisses him.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cSo!\u201d the MC announces. \u201cPark Jimin, which shall it be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks at his choices. Two glittery placards hang from the wall the MC stands in front of.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Failure.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Success.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jimin turns to see Yoongi, seated with the other members across the stage, signature smirk already in place.</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles. \u201cI love you, hyung!\u201d he shouts, marking day one hundred.</p>\n<p>The crowd cheers. The MC laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, Park Jimin,\u201d Yoongi says back, not a shout, just at regular volume. But Jimin can hear it just fine.</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t hold in his happiness.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuccess,\u201d he tells the MC, elated.</p>\n<p>The crowd breaks into applause. Some audience members cheer and whoop. The members cheer along. </p>\n<p>Jimin looks to Yoongi. Yoongi winks at him. </p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart swells.</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic! The MC chirps. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear about the results!\u201d </p>\n<p>They go to commercial.</p>"
