  "summary": "<p>Harry is finally free of the curse that made him able to speak only Parseltongue for thirteen months. Fresh from a summer in Florence with Blaise and the destruction of the Horcrux in his scar, he returns to Britain, ready to prove to everyone that yes, he really is in love with a Slytherin and no, he doesn\u2019t need to be a sacrifice.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>This is a sequel to my fics \u201cVellum Voices\u201d and \u201cSerpentine Summer,\u201d and also one of my \u201cFrom Litha to Lammas\u201d fics. It will probably have four parts.</p>",
  "text": "<p><b></b>\u201cAre you sure that you\u2019re ready to see them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods, then jumps when Blaise abruptly grips his wrist hard. \u201cSorry. I <em>do </em>know that I can talk now. It\u2019s just habit from all the months when I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Or when he knows he could, but no one would understand him and most people would run screaming from a bit of hissing, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to see them, we can leave. Mother would be happy to Apparate us to Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Harry mutters under his breath, scanning the crowd of students spilling onto the platform for Ron and Hermione. Honestly, he loves Blaise, but his overprotectiveness is annoying. The only thing Harry can think of is to ignore it when he can and push back against it when he has to, the same way he does when Hermione goes on about studying too long or Ron won\u2019t talk about anything but how much he hates Malfoy.</p>\n<p>The first person he sees and wants to talk to actually isn\u2019t Ron or Hermione. It\u2019s a huge black dog trotting next to the Weasley family as Molly shepherds Ginny in front of her. Sirius\u2019s eyes widen when he sees Harry. Then his ears perk up and he\u2019s dashing towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere comes Black,\u201d Blaise mutters, and then raises a smoky screen around them with a single flick of his wrist. Harry has never asked whether Mrs. Zabini removed the Trace on his wand or if Blaise just has some other way of getting past it. It never seemed important.</p>\n<p>Other things do.</p>\n<p>Sirius skids to a stop in front of them and barely gives Blaise\u2019s wobbling smoke screen a glance to make sure it\u2019s solid before he transforms. Then he reaches out and hugs Harry, hard. Harry pats Sirius\u2019s back awkwardly, but steps away when Sirius tries to pull Harry behind him.</p>\n<p>For one thing, his and Blaise\u2019s hands are still joined. It\u2019s not going to work anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Sirius has huge eyes that seem even more canine than the last time Harry saw him. They dart back and forth now between his and Blaise\u2019s hands, and then his lip lifts from his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in dog form right now, Sirius, so stop it unless you want me to knock you on the nose,\u201d Harry says, and he thinks it\u2019s his unimpressed tone that drives the growl away from Sirius\u2019s throat as if it\u2019s never been there.</p>\n<p>Sirius stares at him, and his eyes grow wider and wider. \u201cHarry?\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou can speak English again? Did\u2014did Dumbledore do something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snorts. \u201cWhen I was in Italy all summer? Of course not. Mrs. Zabini helped me get rid of the curse, and Blaise has been making sure that I have a reason to live.\u201d He smiles at Blaise.</p>\n<p>Blaise smiles back, but with the little edge to it that he gets whenever Harry even <em>jokes </em>about dying. Harry hides a sigh. Blaise got upset when Harry didn\u2019t tell him that he fully expected to die in the war, one way or another, and now he gets upset whenever Harry talks about how much he wants to live. There\u2019s no winning with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014but how? There\u2019s no way that anyone could break the curse, or Albus would have found a way.\u201d Sirius looks distressed enough to nearly run away, but instead he\u2019s breathing heavily, his hands forming into fists at his sides.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe curse was anchored around the Horcrux in my scar. Mrs. Zabini knows Legilimency, so she undid it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHorcrux? What?\u201d Sirius is so pale that he matches the color of Blaise\u2019s smoke. \u201cI\u2014you were one? You <em>are </em>one? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat seems to be a common occurrence,\u201d Blaise mutters, but Harry digs an elbow into his ribs and makes him shut up. He promised to be silent when Blaise interacts with some of the stupid people in Slytherin. The least Blaise can do is let Harry decide how he wants to handle things with his godfather.</p>\n<p>\u201cVoldemort left a piece of his soul in me the night he attacked Mum and Dad,\u201d Harry says softly. He ignores Blaise\u2019s addition of \u201cAnd you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what made it so easy for him to send me dreams and visions, and that\u2019s what he anchored the Parseltongue curse to. It took a lot of effort for Mrs. Zabini to get rid of it, because I had to trust her enough to let her into my mind. And it was painful. But it\u2019s gone now, so the curse went with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius swallows. \u201cI just\u2014there are other Legilimens you could have gone to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho, Black?\u201d Blaise asks, and this time, he completely ignores Harry\u2019s elbow. \u201cSnape, who tore apart Harry\u2019s mind on Dumbledore\u2019s orders last year? <em>Dumbledore</em>, who had to know about this Horcrux if my mother could see it, but didn\u2019t tell Harry it was there and never made an attempt to help with the curse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlaise, you said\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but you would phrase it too gently. This way, Black can\u2019t just disregard me because I\u2019m a Slytherin or whatever stupid reason he has.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou kidnapped Harry! Of course I was worried!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kidnap him. I prevented him from spending a summer with people who would have abused him.\u201d Blaise takes a step forwards, and maybe it\u2019s because of spending a summer with him, but Harry honestly forgot he could be this intimidating. Magic seems to billow around him like fire. \u201cOne would think that you would care more about that, Black, and less about the crest on my robes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius snarls. Harry steps between them before Blaise can tug him backwards again.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlaise, stop it. Sirius, stop it.\u201d Harry speaks quietly but firmly. It\u2019s something he learned from Mrs. Zabini, because then they have to shut up to hear him. It works now. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Sirius. I didn\u2019t suffer from being with Blaise and his mum, and I\u2019m in a lot better health than I was when I spent my summers with the Dursleys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014Harry, kiddo, I <em>know </em>that.\u201d Sirius\u2019s eyes are so earnest. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t even tell us where you were!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Dumbledore would have made me go back to the Dursleys.\u201d Harry has no doubt of that, even if he no longer has the Horcrux in him. Dumbledore is absolutely convinced that the Dursleys\u2019 house is the safest place for Harry, and one thing Harry knows is that Dumbledore doesn\u2019t change his mind easily. \u201cAnd you would have told him where I was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to just come and visit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise snorts loudly. \u201cAre you aware that your eyes dart off to the side when you lie, Black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said <em>stop it</em>.\u201d Harry holds Blaise\u2019s arm and reaches out to punch Sirius\u2019s shoulder when he opens his mouth to say something that\u2019s probably going to be stupid and obnoxious. \u201cAnd I meant it. Sirius, are you loyal to me or to Dumbledore?\u201d</p>\n<p>His godfather looks absolutely flummoxed about being put on the spot like that. Blaise abruptly relaxes next to him, but Harry is aware that has more to do with being smug about Sirius\u2019s reaction. Harry squeezes his arm, hard.</p>\n<p>Blaise gives him a possessive, sidelong look. Harry changes his mind about how effective the squeezing of his arm actually is.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m loyal to you, of course,\u201d Sirius finally whispers. The train is going to leave in just a few minutes, and Harry shifts his weight. Sirius starts speaking faster. \u201cBut I would have\u2014Harry, we <em>have </em>to keep you safe! Even if you\u2019ve got rid of the Horcrux now, it\u2019s not like the Death Eaters know that! And Dumbledore is the best shot to keep you safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Blaise asks sweetly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s been standing guard over Harry himself during the summers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe blood wards around Harry\u2019s house\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould be ineffective without <em>love </em>from his Muggle family, Black. Which he didn\u2019t have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius closes his eyes. \u201cIf it was that bad, Harry, why did you never tell me about it?\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, blame him,\u201d Blaise says savagely, but this time, he does fall silent at the look Harry gives him. Harry turns back to Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone. I kept being told there no alternative, both when I was a kid and the Dursleys kept me instead of tossing me out, and then when I was at Hogwarts and Dumbledore talked about how safe their house was for me. And the Dursleys kept threatening to take me to an orphanage. I didn\u2019t know what they were like. I thought they might be <em>worse</em>. The only person in the wizarding world who wanted me was you, and you were a fugitive on the run and you did what Dumbledore told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius looks almost broken. Harry sighs sadly. He never wanted this. He wants to have a good relationship with Sirius.</p>\n<p>But one thing Mrs. Zabini (Harry still can\u2019t call her Hasfa even in his head) is right about. Harry won\u2019t have that until Sirius breaks his habit of relying on Dumbledore to do his thinking for him. Hell, if Harry hadn\u2019t broken that habit for himself, he never would have gone to Florence with Blaise.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just can\u2019t agree that the Headmaster is the enemy,\u201d Sirius says, with a shake of his head. \u201cNot compared to You-Know-Who.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let\u2019s see how he reacts to the revelation that Harry doesn\u2019t have a Horcrux in him anymore,\u201d Blaise says sweetly, and touches Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHarry, the Express is going to be leaving in two minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius grabs Harry in a hug that makes Harry whoof, and whispers into his ear, \u201cYou\u2019ll write to me? About that and\u2014other things?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hugs him back, and nods against his shoulder. \u201c\u2018Course. I love you, Sirius.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I love you, too.\u201d Sirius changes back into a dog as Blaise banishes the charm that\u2019s kept them from the view of the train platform, and then Blaise directs Harry right towards the train without pausing for the people who want to gape at them or talk to Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Harrys says under his breath as they get onto the train and their trunks follow them, \u201cI like the way you protect me. I love you. But if you haul me around all the time, and try to control my conversations with my friends, we\u2019re going to have <em>problems</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise pauses for a long moment. Then he nods and directs Harry into a compartment. He faces Harry and swats his hair from his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I keep being afraid that now you\u2019re back with your friends again, you\u2019re going to forget all about me and just go back to being exactly like you were in fourth year before\u2014the curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leans in to kiss Blaise lightly. Blaise keeps his hands at his sides, seeming to take Harry\u2019s complaint about him manhandling Harry around seriously. But his eyes grow brighter, and Harry can see a slight change in the color of his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Harry says, as steadily as he can. \u201cDifferent from when we were at your house for the summer, because I can speak again and everyone\u2019s going to go mental about that. But I <em>promise </em>that you\u2019re always going to be important to me, Blaise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise lets his eyes slip shut for a second, leaning forwards until he\u2019s the one resting against Harry\u2019s hands. Harry looks at him in wonder. He knows Blaise would never let anyone else see him like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you can promise that,\u201d Blaise whispers. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry kisses the inside of Blaise\u2019s wrist. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron\u2019s voice is high and nervous. Harry glances up with a smile. Blaise tenses next to him on the seat of the compartment, but settles down when Harry nudges him with the side of his leg. Ron and Hermione come in slowly.</p>\n<p>Neither of them is carrying their trunks, so they must have found a place of their own. Harry watches as Hermione bites her lip and then sits down across from him. Ron does the same thing a second later. Blaise does nothing except shift and sigh loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shut up, Zabini!\u201d Ron explodes, as if he\u2019s been waiting for that. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t kidnapped him all summer\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of people describing it as kidnapping,\u201d Harry interrupts. \u201cI went with Blaise of my own free will. You knew who I was with. I just wouldn\u2019t come back to England, and I wouldn\u2019t send you exact Apparition coordinates. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a long moment, Ron and Hermione gape at him. Harry smiles at them. \u201cWhat? Surprised to hear me speaking English?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>Harry</em>.\u201d Hermione looks as if she would like to fling herself across the compartment and hug him, but also knows that would be inappropriate. She settles for squeezing his hand, hard. Ron just stares in wonder and shakes his head, although Harry thinks he would do more if they were in private.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlaise and his mother undid the curse and gave me back my voice.\u201d Harry raises his chin and leans sideways into Blaise. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew Zabini wouldn\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Hermione says. Harry is somewhat reassured by the smile she gives Blaise. \u201cBut it was hard to calm Sirius down. And Professor Dumbledore said some strange things.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I bet he did, </em>Harry thinks savagely. He doesn\u2019t hate Dumbledore as much as Blaise and his mum seem to, but he has to admit that the man doesn\u2019t look good when he wouldn\u2019t tell Harry about the Horcrux. \u201cI was fine,\u201d he repeats. \u201cSirius doesn\u2019t trust Slytherins, you know that. And Professor Dumbledore was useless last year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMate?\u201d Ron looks utterly startled.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. \u201cI mean he was useless in getting the curse undone. Mrs. Zabini managed. Professor Dumbledore is acting strange because of something I have to talk to him about. And I did talk to Sirius when we were in the train station.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was worried sick about you,\u201d Ron says, with a quick look at Blaise. Blaise only sits silently, looking at them as if they\u2019re interesting but not worth arguing with. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t come out of his room for a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that he\u2019s feeling better now,\u201d Harry says. Sirius must be, if he came to King\u2019s Cross with the Weasleys in the first place. \u201cBut he\u2019ll have to get used to the fact that I\u2019m making my own decisions now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t he\u2014I mean, I\u2019ve read in <em>Hogwarts, A History</em> that the Headmaster stands <em>in loco parentis </em>for orphaned students while they\u2019re at Hogwarts,\u201d Hermione says hesitantly.</p>\n<p>Harry is grateful that Blaise and Mrs. Zabini had him read so many books this summer, or he wouldn\u2019t know what <em>in loco parentis</em> means. \u201cI have a signed document from my legal guardians saying that Mrs. Zabini is going to watch over me from now on, and if I\u2019m sick or injured or otherwise in trouble, Professor Dumbledore will have to have a discussion with her,\u201d he says coolly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got the <em>Dursleys </em>to sign that?\u201d Ron is actually gasping.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry says. \u201cBy sending them a letter explaining they could be rid of me forever if they just did it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise shifts again. Harry knows Blaise disagreed with that decision, not because he wanted the Dursleys to have custody of Harry, but because he wanted to punish them, not ignore them. But Harry is just glad that it\u2019s behind him. Dudley might still grow up to be a decent person. There\u2019s probably no hope for Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, but this way, Harry doesn\u2019t have to stick around to find out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want Sirius as your guardian?\u201d Hermione asks that as if she\u2019s afraid of the answer, but she does ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot when he would have kept me from seeing Blaise, and probably taken me away from Florence and prevented Mrs. Zabini from getting rid of the curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione finally sighs and reaches out to squeeze his hand again. Ron doesn\u2019t look as though he knows what to make of the whole thing. \u201cWell, at least it\u2019s gone. That\u2019s one thing we can feel glad about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry happily agrees, and then they catch up on how their summers were. Blaise interjects only occasionally. Harry doesn\u2019t worry about that, though. Blaise is simply more conversational when they\u2019re alone.</p>\n<p>And <em>other </em>things when they\u2019re alone, too. Harry catches his eye at one point, and Blaise smiles at him in a way that leads Harry\u2019s mind straight to the bedroom.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. It\u2019s going to be difficult as hell being up in Gryffindor Tower while Blaise is down in the dungeons, but luckily, he has an Invisibility Cloak.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI am beyond glad that you have your voice restored to you, my boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s one of the things that bothers Harry about Dumbledore: the man can be sincere when he tries. Harry is pretty sure he\u2019s sincere now.</p>\n<p>It just makes his failure to do something about the Horcrux before this all the more mysterious.</p>\n<p>Harry smiles at him. \u201cThanks, sir. It was actually pretty easy once Mrs. Zabini realized that the curse was anchored to the Horcrux.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore jerks back at that, knocking a delicate silver something to the floor. His face turns the color that most other people\u2019s did when they heard Harry speak for the first time in the Great Hall. Harry watches him, and he won\u2019t deny the poisonous enjoyment stirring to life in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Dumbledore whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said that it was actually pretty easy once Mrs. Zabini realized that the curse was anchored to the Horcrux.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe Harry shouldn\u2019t take that much pleasure in being spiteful, but this man would have seen him condemned to death, or worse, because\u2014why? That\u2019s the question Harry accepted the summons to Dumbledore\u2019s office tonight hoping to answer.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore closes his eyes and exhales slowly. \u201cThen you must realize why I didn\u2019t tell you about it, or offer to remove the curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry leans forwards. \u201cBecause <em>Mrs. Zabini </em>removed the Horcrux. That was partially because the curse defined the shape of it, so it was easier. But she\u2019s not as powerful as you, so you could have seen it and you could have done the same thing. Why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Harry.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s eyes open slowly. And there\u2019s the sheen of actual tears on them. Harry blinks, not having expected that. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I would have had to admit that the Horcrux existed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowns. Blaise speculated once that that was Dumbledore\u2019s motive, but his take was that Dumbledore didn\u2019t want to face up to the consequences of not telling Harry about it earlier. Harry doesn\u2019t believe that without a confession. \u201cWhat do you mean? Why didn\u2019t you want to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore gives him an incredulous look. \u201cBecause it is a horrifying realization. I wanted you to have as carefree a childhood as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry slaps his hand over his face and sighs, long and slow. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t, maybe it\u2019s disrespectful to a powerful wizard in a way that even Mrs. Zabini warned him not to be, but he can\u2019t help it. \u201cProfessor. <em>Sir</em>. Don\u2019t you realize that my childhood stopped being carefree a long time before I came to Hogwarts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that you relatives did not take the best care of you,\u201d Dumbledore says. Harry winces a little, and not from the admission. If he tells Blaise those words, he\u2019ll try to include Dumbledore in his vengeance on the Dursleys. \u201cBut I did not know how to handle the Horcrux.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares at him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is true that I could have got rid of it after Voldemort attached that curse to it.\u201d Dumbledore is speaking with his eyes on the desk, but Harry doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s lying. Rather, he\u2019s too ashamed to look Harry in the face. \u201cBut\u2014I feared to cause you pain. For the year before that, when I first began to believe that it was within you, I could think of no solution but for Voldemort to cast the Killing Curse at you. There was the <em>chance </em>that it would have killed the soul-shard in you and not you, yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry feels his breath stop.</p>\n<p>So Dumbledore was planning to kill him. That\u2019s not something Harry really believed, not even when Blaise would insist on it in a dark murmur, and Mrs. Zabini would frown and agree.</p>\n<p>Harry stares at Dumbledore\u2019s bowed head, and finally breathes again. It\u2019s still hard to make the air go in and out of his lungs the way it\u2019s supposed to.</p>\n<p>Even if it was because he couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do and he truly believed it would spare Harry suffering, Harry doesn\u2019t think that he\u2019ll ever be able to trust the Headmaster again.</p>\n<p>Harry finally clears his throat, because it\u2019s obvious that Dumbledore won\u2019t talk again on his own. \u201cBut when you realized the curse was wrapped around it, why didn\u2019t you try to take it out the way Mrs. Zabini did it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was afraid that Voldemort might use the connection in your mind to look into my eyes through yours and read my plans there,\u201d Dumbledore whispers. \u201cHe must know the connection exists, and what it is, because of how he attached the Parseltongue curse to it. I know many secrets that are not my own only, but the Order of the Phoenix\u2019s as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows and looks away. It\u2019s all understandable. It\u2019s not evil. Last year, Harry would have found it so easy to accept.</p>\n<p>But months of being told over and over, by both Blaise and his mother, that he deserves to be loved and cherished has affected Harry. He can\u2019t really accept that Dumbledore has placed Harry\u2019s safety behind the safety of people like Snape and Order members Harry had never met.</p>\n<p>And he left Harry with the Dursleys. There\u2019s a pain like teeth chewing in Harry\u2019s soul. The space it\u2019s hollowing out is probably going to fill up with distrust and never heal.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turns back, and sees Dumbledore smiling at him wistfully. \u201cI perfectly understand why you might not want to forgive me right now,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI should have sought some other solution. But may I hope for your forgiveness eventually?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Harry says. He\u2019s not sure he can. If nothing else, he would have to keep that forgiveness from Blaise, and Harry just doesn\u2019t <em>want </em>to keep secrets from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is all I have the right to ask. And may I also hope for your cooperation in the war?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowns. \u201cWhat can I do? I don\u2019t get visions of Voldemort anymore because the Horcrux is gone. I mean, I would fight back if he attacked me or someone I knew or Hogwarts itself, but I don\u2019t know what else I can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore picks up his wand and waves it over his right arm, murmuring something under his breath. Harry recoils as an illusion spell wisps away from the skin and reveals black and peeling disaster. It looks as though Dumbledore\u2019s hand has been roasted and is also rotting from the inside at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are other Horcruxes,\u201d Dumbledore says simply. \u201cI destroyed one this summer, but the consequences were\u2014as you see. I doubt I will live long enough to destroy the others. Will you take over that quest for me, and make sure that Voldemort is mortal and can be destroyed at the last? There are reasons why it should be you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows. \u201cOne of the other Horcruxes did that to you? And you think <em>I </em>can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose reasons I mentioned, Harry. I can reveal them to you if you agree that this war is still your war. Otherwise, I must keep them secret because of them touching other people\u2019s secrets, as I mentioned before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. Blaise was right about one thing. The revelation that Harry knew about the Horcrux and isn\u2019t one anymore didn\u2019t change much. Dumbledore is still spinning plots and hinting at cryptic knowledge instead of just talking about the things that he wants Harry to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. But I don\u2019t want to get involved in all these things without talking to Blaise, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore\u2019s face tightens minutely. \u201cIt seems this young man has gained a great deal of influence over you in a short amount of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, when someone actually volunteers to help me, that\u2019s what happens,\u201d Harry says coldly. \u201cAnd he was the only one who stood by me last year except Ron and Hermione when everyone else hated me for speaking Parseltongue and you assigned Snape to rip my mind apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, my boy, if you had learned Occlumency, then I would have felt much more comfortable about removing the curse and the Horcrux\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, everything is still my fault, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry asks. He\u2019s bitter and as sore as though he\u2019s run miles. He wanted to think things would be different and Blaise would be wrong, but he\u2019s not. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to tell me things without me giving life-changing promises, sir, then please let me know.\u201d He turns around and walks out of Dumbledore\u2019s office, leaning heavily on the wall as the moving staircase carries him down.</p>\n<p>Blaise is against the wall nearest the gargoyle, and straightens up the second he sees Harry. Harry gives him the kind of half-hearted glare he did Dumbledore. He <em>told </em>Blaise not to wait, but of course he would.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Blaise\u2019s voice is low and warm, and he runs one hand down Harry\u2019s arm and over his chest as if testing for his heartbeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Harry says, and exhales. \u201cI just\u2014he still wants to <em>use </em>me, Blaise. He wants me to make promises without telling me why, and he wants me to destroy the other Horcruxes when he\u2019s already been injured by one, and he says that he didn\u2019t want to look into my mind because he had to keep other people\u2019s secrets safe and he thought Voldemort would see them in his head through me. Why am I always the <em>least </em>important person to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chokes when he realizes that his eyes are burning, and reaches up to wipe at them. The last thing he wants is to cry in front of Blaise, who has borne so much and stood by him so steadily.</p>\n<p>Blaise kisses him, though, and keeps on kissing him until Harry relaxes into him with a sigh. Then Blaise murmurs against his lips, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be alone tonight. Come with me to Slytherin. No one will hear us or notice us once the curtains are pulled on my bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares at him in surprise. \u201cI have my Cloak\u2014but\u2014my friends will worry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they know that we\u2019re together. They might worry, but they\u2019ll also guess, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry agrees in an exhale, and lets himself agree the rest of the way by pulling his Cloak from his robes. Blaise smiles at him in a way that makes Harry want to give him everything.</p>\n<p>Because Blaise gives him everything. Because Blaise, for whatever reason, is in love with him, and Harry doesn\u2019t know what he did to deserve this, but he\u2019s slowly coming around to the idea that he <em>does </em>deserve it.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019ll give what Blaise gave him a thousandfold.</p>\n<p>No one stops them on the way down to Slytherin, and they make it into Blaise\u2019s bed with no trouble. Then Blaise sets charms on the curtains of the bed that will keep whatever happens inside them silent and prevent anyone from opening them, and turns around to Harry with a brilliant grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Harry drops the Cloak and crosses the distance with a delighted lunge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere were you last night, mate?\u201d Ron whispers as Harry slides into place beside him at the Gryffindor table.</p>\n<p>Harry waggles his eyebrows at Ron, who stares at him for a second. Then his face turns some combination of white and purple, and he looks briefly over at Blaise at the Slytherin table before he turns sharply away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, fine,\u201d he says hoarsely. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me anything about it. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughs and takes some of the toast. He\u2019s in a roaring good mood with the world today, like being in the middle of a waterfall with the sun shining on it. \u201cIf it helps, Blaise and I won\u2019t be doing this often. It\u2019s too risky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Using your Cloak to sneak around?\u201d Hermione takes the seat next to him on the other side. She must have got distracted by some book in the library, Harry notes; normally, Ron is never to breakfast before she is. \u201cGood. It\u2019s risky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I just said that,\u201d Harry says, and beams at her.</p>\n<p>Hermione looks away for a second, and then laughs in what sounds like resignation. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t even worry about the kind of impact that he\u2019s having on you, because no one has ever made you this <em>happy</em>, Harry. Tell Zabini I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help him, because he\u2019s helping you so much in return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Harry says, and hugs her with one arm for a second before he turns to the important business of getting food into his stomach and making eyes at Blaise across the Great Hall.</p>\n<p>Some of the Slytherins look disgusted by that. As far as Harry is concerned, they\u2019re welcome to, although he does spare a fleeting thought to what kind of reputation Blaise is going to get in his own House. He\u2019d <em>better </em>tell Harry if he has any trouble, considering the kind of hell he would raise if Harry didn\u2019t tell him about problems with the Gryffindors.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Snape is the Defense professor.</p>\n<p>Blaise is unhappy about this.</p>\n<p>Snape has done a lot for Slytherins in general, or so he likes to brag. In truth, Blaise has long found his favoritism in Potions irritating. It\u2019s harder to make his own mark when everyone always attributes his abilities to Snape\u2019s insistence on trying to get Slytherins out of trouble and give them unfair points. And Snape spends more attention on the Slytherins who are from prominent British families or have Death Eater parents.</p>\n<p>With part of himself, Blaise understands that. If Snape can persuade them not to be so stupid, then he would probably consider that a deed well-done.</p>\n<p>But it also means that Snape has ignored issues of bullying and unfairness among the Slytherins if the students have parents who were too intelligent to be taken in by the Dark Lord\u2019s nonsense. Blaise doesn\u2019t see why he should have to go to his Head of House with clear evidence that Malfoy was practicing torture curses last year, as part of Umbridge\u2019s Inquisitorial Squad, and be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Now Snape has taken over the Defense class, which is Harry\u2019s best subject.</p>\n<p>Blaise will be watching him.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, it only takes five minutes into Snape\u2019s lecture about nonverbal spells before he decides to turn and target Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, our <em>celebrity </em>should have no problem with those spells,\u201d Snape says, and Blaise wonders if someone once told him the sneer was a good idea. It\u2019s not. \u201cSeeing as he spent most of last year wordless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s shoulders tighten, and Blaise can see how badly he wants to retort. But instead, he does as Mother said would be a good idea: fastens his eyes in the middle of Snape\u2019s nose, to make it impossible for the man to read his mind, and says mildly, \u201cI don\u2019t think I know that much more nonverbal magic than anyone else, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive points from Gryffindor for insolence,\u201d Snape says, and swirls away in a blast of black robes. Blaise catches a disgruntled expression on the face of Seamus Finnigan, who was one of the people who thought Harry was lying last year. Blaise will be watching him, too.</p>\n<p>Snape pairs them up to practice nonverbal Shield Charms. Blaise moves towards Harry, but Snape is abruptly standing in front of him, staring down one side of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it advisable that you do not work with your <em>partner</em>,\u201d Snape breathes. \u201cThat place will be taken by Mr. Malfoy. Why don\u2019t you work with Miss Granger, Mr. Zabini?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise nods mildly and goes to stand opposite Granger. He truly has no objection to her, unless she decides that she needs to \u201crescue\u201d Harry from him. She\u2019s intelligent enough to ask the right questions, which spares Blaise from having to speak up more often than he likes. His mother\u2019s best advice when he came to Hogwarts was to remain reticent, not showing his abilities or brain as openly as he might, to surprise those who could come after him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s showed more of himself to Harry than anyone else. And he doesn\u2019t mind showing more if it will keep Snape or Malfoy from tormenting Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise smiles at Granger. \u201cOh, I know that. He\u2019s strong. And he knows that if he did get in trouble, I would have his back.\u201d He draws his wand and waits for Granger to try the nonverbal <em>Protego.</em></p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t, though. \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Malfoy did something to Harry? I would remind him that I know some embarrassing secrets of his he wouldn\u2019t want spread around the school.\u201d And that\u2019s true. Blaise doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s only a first step, or that he would kill in defense of Harry if he had to, the way his mother has killed in defense of his father\u2019s memory.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see.\u201d Granger looks pleased with him. Blaise smiles back, and makes a little note not to tell her that he would do something to Professor Snape, as well. Granger respects authority and would think assaulting a teacher beyond the pale.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cast a Jelly-Legs Jinx,\u201d he says, after a few more moments when Granger has been making the motion for the Shield Charm with her wand and looking more and more frustrated. \u201cIn two minutes. Ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d She shifts some of her hair out of the way and glares at Blaise as if it\u2019s his fault. \u201cWhy is wordless magic so hard?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise smiles. \u201cThe incantation and the wand movement work together with the spell for most wizards. They come to think of them as the same thing. But really, they\u2019re separate. What\u2019s important is the <em>magic</em>. If you can command that, and separate it from the movement and words, you\u2019ll see how much you can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger\u2019s mouth falls open a little. \u201cYou explained that a lot more clearly than Professor Snape.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has his own methods of teaching,\u201d Blaise says. Bland words can conceal a lot, another lesson his mother taught him. He nods. \u201cAnd you have a minute and a half until I cast the Jelly-Legs Jinx.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granger nods back, but before she can start making the wand movement again, there\u2019s a shriek from the other side of the classroom. Blaise turns at once. He would know the sound of that shriek anywhere. It\u2019s what happens when someone decides to prank the potions that Malfoy uses on his hair.</p>\n<p>He finds Malfoy flat on his back, a shimmering net of white light around him. It\u2019s one of the defensive spells that Mother taught Harry, and had him practice before he had his voice back. Which means he cast it nonverbally. Blaise grins.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mr. </em>Potter!\u201d Snape is stalking towards Harry. Blaise finds himself judging the distance between himself and Snape, and sighs. He needs to calm down and remember that Harry is capable of defense, too. \u201cWhat did I say about nonverbal magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry half-shrugs. \u201cI did cast that wordlessly, sir. And you said that we should cast minor hexes and jinxes at the shields.\u201d He glares at Malfoy, his stance immediately shifting. Blaise smiles. Of course, he\u2019s biased, but in his opinion, he doesn\u2019t understand why people continue to oppose Harry, when he looks like that. \u201cHe was casting the Cruciatus Curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise tenses. He turns deliberately to face Malfoy. In the classroom of gasps and flailing hands, it catches his fellow Slytherin\u2019s attention. Blaise lets the mask across his eyes drop, and sees Malfoy flinch from the promise of pain.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t have to happen if he does certain things, though. For example, Professor Snape is laughing like an idiot at the idea that Draco Malfoy cast the Cruciatus Curse.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn Unforgivable, in the <em>classroom</em>? Simply accusing the son of a prominent politician of such a crime is something in which the Ministry will be very interested, Mr. Potter. One hundred points from\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence that floods the classroom with a deep, delicious coolness, and makes Blaise conceal another smile. He sees Harry flick a suspicious glance at him. Blaise meets it with his own innocence. Harry might not believe that, but he isn\u2019t going to raise the possibility in the midst of all this.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy\u2026\u201d It sounds as if Snape has lost his breath somewhere and is never going to find it again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I wanted to test the strength of Potter\u2019s shield.\u201d Malfoy tries to shift, but the net follows him, sparkling brightly. Harry flicks his wand and dismisses it. Malfoy looks around at the staring faces and then down at the floor. \u201cI thought an Unforgivable Curse would be the right way to do it. If he\u2019s really as powerful as everyone says, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>More silence. Blaise does think it\u2019s interesting that Malfoy chose that argument, and that it brought a slight tinge of color to Snape\u2019s cheeks. He wonders if Harry\u2019s power is one argument that Snape has been using to try and convince Malfoy to turn away from the Dark Lord.</p>\n<p>Never mind if it is. Blaise has much more persuasive arguments at the tip of his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should not have done such a thing, Mr. Malfoy.\u201d Snape speaks slowly. \u201cYou will have detention with me for tonight, I believe. And\u2014\u201d He looks as though he\u2019s on the verge of a heart attack. \u201cTwo points from Slytherin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi! That\u2019s <em>illegal</em>, and you were going to take <em>one hundred </em>points from Harry just for telling the truth\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty points from Gryffindor for insolence, Weasley!\u201d Snape looks a lot more cheerful now. \u201cI will decide what constitutes grounds for detention and point-taking in my classroom. Or do you want to argue that?\u201d he adds in a purr as all of them see Weasley\u2019s mouth opening again.</p>\n<p>Weasley only gapes like a fish for a second before he closes his mouth and glowers. That\u2019s not of his own free will, though. Blaise is sure that he heard Granger whisper \u201c<em>Silencio</em>\u201d under her breath a moment ago.</p>\n<p>Snape sighs as though they\u2019ve ruined his day by refusing to let him take more points from Gryffindor, and then splits them up into different partners, this time not objecting when Blaise reaches out to draw Harry with him. He\u2019s too busy dragging Malfoy towards the far side of the classroom to snarl at him. Blaise would like to eavesdrop on them, but right now, he\u2019s more concerned about Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right?\u2019 he asks softly. He scans Harry to make sure that he isn\u2019t hiding cuts or anything, although he thinks that none of Malfoy\u2019s attempted spells landed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Tell you Mum thanks for the lessons, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can tell her thanks yourself. Or didn\u2019t you realize that she wanted you to write to her after we got back to Hogwarts?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks as though someone has slapped him. \u201cI\u2014Blaise, no, I didn\u2019t. I just never had any relatives to send owls to, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d Blaise doesn\u2019t enjoy thinking about the Muggles, so he doesn\u2019t. He smiles at Harry instead. \u201cAnd I know that you cast the Restraining Net nonverbally, so come over here and help me explain wordless magic to Granger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughs. There\u2019s a surging brightness in his voice and smile that Blaise could stand to watch every day.</p>\n<p>But he only shows his appreciation with a quick trailing of his hand down Harry\u2019s shoulder for the moment, and then turns around to walk back towards Granger. He knows how to behave in a classroom far better than \u201cProfessor\u201d Snape.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do to Malfoy?\u201d Harry whispers to Blaise a week later, when they\u2019re outside Defense and he can actually see the way Malfoy hunches his shoulders and avoids looking at him <em>or </em>Blaise, and flinches when a touch of their robes might bring them into contact.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think I did something to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t flinching that way right after I accused him of using the Cruciatus, or even when Snape talked to him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo untrusting, my love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith good reason,\u201d Harry snaps, and then sighs to himself when he sees the way Blaise\u2019s face darkens. Sometimes he wants to go back in time and change the way he grew up with the Dursleys just to make sure that Blaise never looks like that again. \u201cListen, Blaise, I really do appreciate you standing up for me, but I meant what I said about you not interfering in my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy did something <em>illegal</em>. And he was stupid enough to get caught. All I did was encourage him to stay away from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Blaise catches his hand and squeezes it once. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, love. It\u2019s true that I threatened him with blackmail, but I didn\u2019t curse him and I didn\u2019t give him a gift like the one I gave you last year. I promise. You can\u2019t expect me to stand back and do nothing when he attacks you that blatantly and might have got away with it. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods reluctantly. He knows that. After the stories about Blaise\u2019s mother marrying and murdering the men who were involved in murdering Blaise\u2019s father, he knows how seriously the Zabinis take love. Not to mention the \u201cgift\u201d Blaise is referring to, which killed Umbridge.</p>\n<p>And although it\u2019s not the sort of thing he can admit to Ron and Hermione, let alone Dumbledore\u2026Harry kind of likes that someone cares for him that much. He wouldn\u2019t want to let Blaise take over his life any more than he would let anyone else, but he\u2019s always craved someone to love him as deeply as the Weasleys love Ron and Ginny, or Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon love Dudley.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not exactly innocent, either, since he\u2019s the one who used the \u201cgift\u201d to murder Umbridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he tells Blaise, and they start to walk away from the classroom. \u201cI know what kind of bloke you are, and I fell in love with you anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise won\u2019t show it here, in front of other people, but his dark eyes are deep and glowing, and it seems his face is much the same. Despite having his mother, and for part of his life his father, Harry knows Blaise yearned for someone to love him in that same way.</p>\n<p>And Harry has, now, not only the chance to be this beloved, but also the chance to make someone else feel the same way.</p>\n<p>He has <em>never </em>been so happy.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Snape tells me there was an unfortunate incident in his classroom, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry actually has to think about what Dumbledore means, because it\u2019s been a month now since the mess with Malfoy. He\u2019s been busy with Blaise, and his friends, and studying for NEWTS next year, and in general feeling relieved that Voldemort isn\u2019t stalking his every move anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mean the time Malfoy cast a Cruciatus Curse at me, sir?\u201d he finally asks. He refused tea when he first came up to the office, and he does again now that Dumbledore is pushing it at him. He looks around instead. The books on the shelves, for the first time, interest him more than the little whirring silver instruments Dumbledore has everywhere, although the most interesting thing in the office is still Fawkes, who chirps cheerfully at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Professor Snape says that you defended yourself with rather advanced nonverbal magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI learned it this summer, sir. It turns out that being unable to speak English was good for <em>some </em>things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore stares at him. Harry only smiles blandly back, and doesn\u2019t meet his eyes. He\u2019s sure that sooner or later, Dumbledore will say why he brought him up here, and it can\u2019t be to discuss something that happened back in September.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel as if I do not know you at all, Harry,\u201d Dumbledore finishes with a little sigh. He turns back to his own tea, and Harry wonders for a second if Dumbledore wants to see something in the tea leaves, the way Trelawney is always trying to do.</p>\n<p>(Well, Harry assumes that she\u2019s still trying to do that. On Mrs. Zabini\u2019s insistence, he dropped Divination. It\u2019s too late for him to join the Ancient Runes class, the way she wanted him to, but he\u2019ll make do with private tutoring).</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you change so much?\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes it sound as though Dumbledore wants to know, but Harry doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s true. He answers as though the Headmaster is sincere, though. He still doesn\u2019t believe in his malice the way Blaise and Mrs. Zabini do. \u201cBecause I had a curse on me that meant almost everyone rejected me, sir. And I was furious and in despair. I thought I\u2019d have to die to remove it. And then I found out about the Horcrux and thought I\u2019d have to die to remove <em>that</em>. I finally stopped caring about whether I offended the sensibilities of all these people who wanted to hide behind me. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014never knew\u2014it makes you sound as though you were considering suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was considering self-sacrifice, to remove the Horcrux, yes. And please don\u2019t act as though you find the thought abhorrent, sir,\u201d Harry adds, when Dumbledore gives him a horrified look. \u201cYou\u2018re the one who told me that I would have to die to remove the Horcrux.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never meant for you to commit suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes, and doesn\u2019t care that Dumbledore sees it. \u201cSelf-sacrifice is essentially the same thing, sir. Was there something else you wanted to ask me, or can I go back to studying Ancient Runes now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to know if you had considered the vow that I wanted you to make, Mr. Potter, so that I can share some of the secrets with you that I have guarded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided that I don\u2019t want to know. It would probably only depress me. So I won\u2019t make the vow, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore makes a low sound of pain. \u201cThere are important reasons for why the quest to destroy the remainder of the Horcruxes should belong to you, Mr. Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry asks, and only nods when he sees that Dumbledore has no intention of answering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. It\u2019s simply not something I\u2019m interested in taking on without more information, which you won\u2019t give me.\u201d He stands up. \u201cThank you for inviting me to your office, but please don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore watches him the entire time he walks across the office, and Fawkes trills sadly. But he doesn\u2019t come after Harry to convince him to return, either.</p>\n<p>Harry shoots one smile over his shoulder, aimed at Fawkes, not Dumbledore, before he closes the door of the office softly behind him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a bodyguard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I say you did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hovering at my shoulder,\u201d Harry says in some irritation as he and Blaise walk out of the entrance hall doors and towards the cave in the hills where Sirius met Harry once before.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay that I want to see the expression on Black\u2019s face when he talks to you about Dumbledore\u2019s behavior.\u201d Blaise shrugs, adjusts the scarf around his neck, and then turns and casts a Warming Charm on Harry\u2019s own scarf.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could have done that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes and lets it go. Blaise is coming with him to speak to Sirius, and that\u2019s pretty final, from the way he\u2019s talking. Harry knows when to give up.</p>\n<p>They reach the cave without incident, although part of the way they do use Disillusionment Charms so that no one thinks they\u2019re trying to visit Hogsmeade without permission. Harry insists on Blaise dropping the charms before they get to the cave. He doesn\u2019t want to make Sirius think they\u2019re trying to sneak up on him or something. Sirius is paranoid enough about sneaky Slytherins as it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Sirius bounds out of the cave and hugs him, giving Blaise a stiff nod. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>It actually takes Harry a long moment to remember that it\u2019s Halloween today, and Sirius probably expects him to be upset over the deaths of his parents. He sighs a little and smiles at Sirius. \u201cI\u2019m doing all right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in, come in.\u201d Sirius ushers him into the cave, where he has some Transfigured or conjured chairs waiting and a small tea that Harry knows probably comes courtesy of Dobby. Sirius sits down and looks from him to Blaise. \u201cDoes he have to be here eavesdropping?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEavesdropping is what happens when you don\u2019t know someone is there,\u201d Blaise responds calmly, taking the chair next to Harry and pouring himself a cup of tea that he then practically strangles with sugar. \u201cYou know I\u2019m here, Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius sighs in a ridiculously pouty fashion\u2014even Harry thinks that\u2014and turns to Harry. \u201c<em>Fiiiiine</em>,\u201d he says, drawing out the word. \u201cNow, Harry, I read the letter where you told me what Dumbledore said about the Horcrux and the way he envisioned things playing out.\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t sound good. Harry swallows against anxiety and receives a reassuring nod from Blaise. If something happens that means he can\u2019t really have Sirius as his godfather again, Blaise is here for him. \u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there are reasons that he probably thought it would work. Not that Albus ever plays his hand openly. But considering the prophecy\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat prophecy?\u201d Blaise and Harry speak at the same time, and Harry thinks later that there really isn\u2019t much to choose from in their cold voices.</p>\n<p>Sirius shrinks back in his chair. He looks as if he\u2019d prefer to change into a dog and run out of the cave to avoid this whole conversation. Harry surreptitiously draws his wand, just in case.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <em>really </em>didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d There\u2019s even a dog-like whine at the end of Sirius\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI want you to tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius takes a deep breath. \u201cThere was a prophecy that said You-Know-Who would come after you. I don\u2019t know what it says, I mean the exact wording. Albus told me this summer. I thought\u2014he implied\u2014maybe he only implied that he told you. But I thought you knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows. That would explain a lot of things, including why Voldemort was so obsessively determined to kill him. It\u2019s not as though he knew that he would make Harry a Horcrux when he went after him that night, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would he keep that a secret?\u201d Blaise asks the question that Harry would have got around to asking, once the lump in his throat melted. Harry is grateful that someone else did it for him, though. He reaches out and squeezes Blaise\u2019s hand, and gets a squeeze back, but Blaise never takes his eyes off Sirius.</p>\n<p>Sirius shuts his eyes. \u201cBecause one of You-Know-Who\u2019s spies overheard the prophecy and carried part of it to him. Not the whole of it, Albus says. But enough that You-Know-Who figured out how to target you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t make\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise shuts up so abruptly that Harry knows it wasn\u2019t natural. Harry glances at him. Blaise has a quiet, concentrated fury about him that Harry has only ever seen when Blaise found out about Harry thinking he\u2019d need to die to remove the Horcrux.</p>\n<p>\u201cSnape,\u201d Blaise snarls softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d But then Harry catches the drift of Blaise\u2019s thoughts. \u201cSo you think that he was the one who overheard the prophecy? And then later he changed his mind and decided to spy for Dumbledore instead? But why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I can answer,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cI mean, Dumbledore didn\u2019t tell me. But I know. Snape was friends with your mum for a long time. Then he called her a Mudblood when we were in our fifth year, and that was the end of it. But he would probably still have felt bad when he realized the prophecy targeted her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes. The world is dancing dizzily around him, and he needs some distance to cope with it.</p>\n<p>Blaise puts a hand on his shoulder and then hands him a cup of tea. Harry drinks it and sighs. The flavor is stronger than usual. Maybe Blaise poured some sort of potion into it.</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t blame him for that, if so. He opens his eyes and focuses on Sirius again. \u201cAnd you never thought to <em>tell </em>me that Snape and my mum were friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius gives him a strange look. \u201cWhy would I? When would I? Snape hated you, so obviously it doesn\u2019t matter if he is still upset about getting Lily killed. It doesn\u2019t affect the way he treats you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would have something to do with how hard he tried to protect me, though, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, probably. Dumbledore made reference to some kind of vow Snape swore, but that was all he would say. He wouldn\u2019t give me the particulars.\u201d Sirius shrugs uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>\u201cA vow to protect Harry, it has to be,\u201d Blaise says. He sounds like he\u2019s thinking aloud, and Harry turns to admire his expression while he does that. It\u2019s one of his favorite looks on Blaise. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason that Dumbledore swore that Snape was innocent and gave him a job at Hogwarts, in return for that vow. And probably also a promise to go back and spy on the Dark Lord when he rose again. That\u2019s the reason Dumbledore didn\u2019t want to tell you without your own vow, Harry,\u201d he adds quietly, turning towards Harry and holding his eyes. \u201cHe knew you would blame Snape, which of course you should, and probably strike back at him. But the prophecy makes Dumbledore believe that you should be the one to destroy the Horcruxes, because you\u2019re prophesied to defeat the Dark Lord. You won\u2019t be dying to remove the Horcrux now, so it must be some other way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shudders. Yes, that sounds right. He doesn\u2019t know if all the details are true, but it would explain why Dumbledore didn\u2019t just tell him about the prophecy. He doesn\u2019t want Harry to go out and curse Snape.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Black,\u201d Blaise says, and Harry feels more than sees him turn back to face Sirius. \u201cAre you going to work with Albus anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius is quiet, and Harry looks up. His buzzing brain makes him more prone to accept it if Sirius does declare that he stands with Dumbledore. He has so much to think about. Losing Sirius would no longer be the worst pain he\u2019s suffered in his life.</p>\n<p>Sirius swallows and says, \u201cI still want to fight You-Know-Who.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen work with the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d Blaise says, with a light shrug that is amazing to Harry given how tightly he knows Blaise is wound. \u201cBut are you going to try and convince Harry to work with Dumbledore anymore? Or defend him? That\u2019s mainly what we came here today to find out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius takes a deep breath. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles at him, and Sirius reaches out and abruptly hugs him. \u201cGod, I wish I\u2019d got to raise you,\u201d he whispers into Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t run off after Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, I forgave you for that a long time ago,\u201d Harry says. He catches a glimpse of Blaise\u2019s disapproving expression, but he ignores it. Blaise can have opinions on what Harry does and says, but he doesn\u2019t get to control it.</p>\n<p>Sirius leans back, and they have almost a nice tea after that, although Harry knows Blaise is silently criticizing the biscuits and the platters and everything else in his head. He doesn\u2019t say it aloud, though, which is progress.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Blaise raises an eyebrow as Harry turns away from waving good-bye to his godfather. They\u2019re not at the point in the path yet where they\u2019ll need their Disillusionment Charms.</p>\n<p>Harry narrows his eyes. He looks so formidable like this, jaw thrust out, that he rather takes Blaise\u2019s breath away. \u201cTake revenge on Snape. I know that you\u2019re thinking about it. If anyone\u2019s going to take revenge on him, it\u2019ll be me, and for things like the way he treated Neville, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise hesitates. The urge to protect Harry is so strong. He did it last year, when he barely knew Harry, and Harry didn\u2019t object to that.</p>\n<p>Of course, Harry has also come a long way from the furious, frightened boy who was willing to use the crystals that would kill Umbridge just because he was worn down by her torture and the utter <em>ignorance </em>of everyone else in the school.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Blaise relents. \u201cBut if you ever change your mind, let me know right away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry relaxes and smiles at him, and Blaise loses all sense of regret that Harry won\u2019t agree to let Blaise protect him the way he deserves. He prefers Harry like this, brilliant of heart and mind and magic and mood.</p>\n<p>And all <em>his</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Harry murmurs, and leans forwards to kiss him, and Blaise forgets regret altogether, just as Harry\u2019s lips coax him into forgetting the chill wind touched with rain.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come to the Burrow for Christmas, right, mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust for Christmas Day itself,\u201d Harry says, turning the page of his Charms book and frowning at the description of the Summoning Charm there. He <em>knows </em>that isn\u2019t right. If it\u2019s wrong about something so simple that he learned in fourth year, what else is it wrong about?</p>\n<p>A silence seems to settle over the Gryffindor table. Harry looks up, but he only looks at Ron. Dean has been passively friendly, Neville doesn\u2019t seem to know what to make of Harry since his \u201creturn\u201d from Italy, and Seamus still believes the lies that the <em>Prophet </em>continues to print. Harry doesn\u2019t owe them anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry adds. \u201cI\u2019m going to be in Florence most of the time, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us that.\u201d Ron doesn\u2019t look surprised, but his face is turning red.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I sort of assumed you\u2019d assume I was, especially knowing what you know.\u201d Harry hasn\u2019t gone around announcing to everyone that Mrs. Zabini has custody of him now, although he hasn\u2019t denied it to those who want to know, either. It\u2019s amazing how many people would <em>rather </em>gossip about him than just ask him something directly. \u201cBut Mrs. Zabini has permission for an International Portkey so I can visit Britain on Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that Harry has a family to go to now,\u201d Hermione says firmly. \u201cDid I tell you that my parents and I are going back to France for the holidays? Mum thinks she\u2019s discovered old relatives on her side there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles gratefully at Hermione as she adds to the conversation. She just nods back, serenely, and then turns to answer some questions from Parvati about France and how long it takes to learn French.</p>\n<p>\u201cThings just keep changing,\u201d Ron complains next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, mate, can\u2019t help that,\u201d Harry says. He glances back and forth between the pages of the Charms book, and then nods as he ferries another forkful of scrambled eggs to his plate. Yes, it <em>is </em>wrong. He\u2019s going to have to bring this to Professor Flitwick\u2019s attention. Maybe it\u2019s a mistake in this one book and not others, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut did it have to change so fast?\u201d Ron sighs and pokes his food, which makes Harry put the Charms book away and pay attention. Ron in a mood to refuse food is Ron in a <em>serious </em>mood. \u201cI just feel like one day everything was fine, and then things started changing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was <em>fine</em> when I couldn\u2019t speak English?\u201d Harry makes his voice cool.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I mean\u2014I wanted that to change. But not anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry does understand. He claps Ron\u2019s shoulder. \u201cListen, you\u2019re still one of my best friends. But just being three Gryffindors together was never going to last forever. I couldn\u2019t speak English last year, and I was furious most of the time. If it hadn\u2019t been for Blaise, I don\u2019t know what would have happened. He\u2019s the reason I can talk now, and he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m happy now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron hesitates for a long second. Harry waits, honestly not sure what he wants to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re really not going to\u2014you\u2019re not the Boy-Who-Lived anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be your friend, Ron. I\u2019ll always be the kid who survived the Killing Curse because of what my <em>mum</em> did.\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t want to let people forget that, and Blaise is uniquely understanding of him wanting people to celebrate his mum more. \u201cBut no, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m Voldemort\u2019s primary target anymore.\u201d He\u2019s not actually sure what Voldemort wants lately. He\u2019s been pretty quiet, except for a few potential murders that could also be actual accidents.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to join the <em>old crowd</em>?\u201d Ron hisses, his eyes flickering around.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, mate\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I could trust everybody, I would,\u201d Harry tells him with a faint smile. \u201cBut I can\u2019t, and that\u2019s all there is to it. You know me, mate. I\u2019m not inclined to trust adults that much anyway, and last year it got worse because they acted like they couldn\u2019t find their arses with both hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron laughs reluctantly, while Hermione turns around to scold both of them, Harry for language and Ron for laughing about it. Harry grins over how normal that is, and manages to catch Blaise\u2019s eye across the Great Hall. Blaise lifts his goblet in salute.</p>\n<p>Blaise was the one who told him that things with his best friends would be more normal than Harry worried they would be. He said they were great friends, and they would get used to things changing.</p>\n<p>Once again, Blaise is right.</p>\n<p><em>Not that I\u2019m going to tell him that, he\u2019s conceited enough already, </em>Harry adds contentedly to himself.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, how you have grown!\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise conceals a grin at the befuddled look on Harry\u2019s face as Mother bends down to hug him. He really hasn\u2019t grown, of course. But it\u2019s the same thing that Mother often says to him, and she doesn\u2019t want to leave Harry out.</p>\n<p>And, of course, Harry has never been able to remember his parents. Blaise scowls. He has come up with plans to take vengeance on the Dursleys and Snape\u2014if Harry ever allows him to\u2014but he doesn\u2019t know what to do about the Dark Lord.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, thanks, Mrs. Zabini,\u201d Harry says, and frees himself from Mother\u2019s embrace with a little practiced twist. It hurts Blaise\u2019s heart to realize where that kind of motion probably comes from: freeing himself from much less tender embraces and holds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you that I would prefer to be called Hafsa, if you are not comfortable calling me Mother,\u201d Mother says, and enchants Harry\u2019s luggage and Blaise\u2019s to float next to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh. Hafsa, then.\u201d Harry\u2019s face is bright red, but he does say it.</p>\n<p><em>He finds refuge in formalities, even though he\u2019s also one of the most informal people I know, </em>Blaise thinks, catching Harry\u2019s hand and sending him a reassuring smile. <em>He didn\u2019t grow up with the same kind of confidence and poise that a lot of people did. He had to make his own.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Harry. Come along now.\u201d Mother leads them to the alley where the International Portkey is set to go off, and Blaise tightens his arm around Harry\u2019s waist when it starts. He knows that Harry doesn\u2019t like Portkey travel much, probably as a remnant of that terrible Portkey cup in the Tri-Wizard Tournament.</p>\n<p>Harry visibly relaxes once they\u2019re in the villa, and goes off to claim his old room with every evidence of cheerfulness. Mother turns to Blaise at once. \u201cHas he been settling in well? Please be truthful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry isn\u2019t in his letters?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe barely says anything, Blaise. I understand why, and I know it might take him years to feel comfortable with me. But I also want to make sure that there isn\u2019t someone hurting him whose effects he\u2019s attempting to downplay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Blaise says slowly, thinking back over the past term. \u201cHe just shrugs off Professor Snape\u2019s insults now, and his best friends accepted him back without prompting. Some of the Gryffindors glare at him. They never approach him, though. He knows his godfather is on his side, and that\u2019s been the best thing of all for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Professor Dumbledore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s left Harry alone since October,\u201d Blaise says, and he knows he\u2019s being truthful. Harry wouldn\u2019t hide that from him, even if he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable writing to Mother about it. \u201cHe wanted Harry to swear a vow before he shared any information with him, and part of that vow would have meant Harry keeping dangerous secrets. Including the secrets about Professor Snape I already wrote to you about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing since I told him that the moment he tried to cast any kind of pain curse at Harry again, the whole school would know about the plush dragon he sleeps with. And worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother chuckles. \u201cGood. I expect you to let me know the moment that changes, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I expect you to tell me if something <em>more </em>needs to be done. I am sympathetic to your desire to handle danger by yourself, but I will tolerate no threats to my son or my son-in-law. It should never have to advance as far as it did last year, with the actual torture of a Blood Quill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother, you didn\u2019t know that Harry would be your son-in-law then,\u201d Blaise has to point out. Sometimes Mother acts as if Blaise should be able to see the future, but if Blaise has any talent in that direction, it\u2019s never revealed itself to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly because I did not know did I allow it to get that far.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise nods. He completely agrees with that. Harry suffered in the past, and they can\u2019t do anything about that because time travel is not something the Zabini magic has perfected and Harry doesn\u2019t want them taking vengeance on people for him. But they can protect him from the harm that might arise in the future.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will take care of him now.\u201d Mother passes her hand through his hair, and smiles at him. \u201cI will not allow him to suffer as your father suffered. Or you, as I suffered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother rarely speaks of Father. Blaise curls nearer to her, and they stay there until they hear Harry calling for Blaise from the top of the stairs. Blaise reluctantly steps away from his mother and glances back, once, at her, as he goes to see his lover.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you need to keep him safe,\u201d Mother answers his unspoken question, \u201cyou will have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise smiles. He knows, but it\u2019s always nice to hear it aloud.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry sighs a little as yet another present floats over to him. Blaise and Mrs. Zabini follow a custom that she says was in her family when she was a little girl: there\u2019s three presents for three days, then four presents for four days, ending the day before Christmas. This is his fourth present of the day.</p>\n<p>Harry tried to be thoughtful and careful about what he bought them. That\u2019s not really the problem. The problem is that even as part of him squirms with delight at being spoiled, another part feels that they shouldn\u2019t be spending <em>this </em>much money on him.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini\u2014Harry is trying to remember to call her \u201cHafsa\u201d aloud, although it\u2019s hard\u2014smiles at him, and seems to guess his thoughts. \u201cAll you must do, Harry, is remember that the vast majority of my fortune didn\u2019t originally belong to me. I rather enjoy spending the money of those who murdered my husband or profited from his death on my son\u2019s lover.\u201d She winks. \u201cThis particular gift comes from the vault of a man who was personally disgusted by gay people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Um. Thank you.\u201d Harry unwraps the gift, and tries not to be hesitant about it. Blaise is already at his side, leaning in with interest, which suggests that he doesn\u2019t know what his mother got Harry, either.</p>\n<p>It turns out to be a plain wooden stick that looks a lot like a wand, but it has no features, not even any grain to the wood. Harry turns it over curiously before glancing at Mrs. Zabini for an explanation. It\u2019s not like there are instructions in the package the way there would be with a Muggle toy.</p>\n<p>And somehow, he doesn\u2019t think that Mrs. Zabini would give him toys, although she has given him some beautiful decorations that can hang on curtains, so he can put them up in his bed here or at Hogwarts.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, I forgot that you wouldn\u2019t know a holder wand when you see one.\u201d Mrs. Zabini\u2019s smile is soft, and she reaches out to trace her fingers down Harry\u2019s temple. They\u2019re seated around the cozy little table in what Mrs. Zabini calls the breakfast nook. She let Harry and Blaise wear their pyjamas, and she\u2019s dressed in a more casual robe than Harry\u2019s ever seen, with just a little indigo embroidery, although her hair is still up beneath a white silken scarf. \u201cIt\u2019s meant as a second line of defense, my dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven though it doesn\u2019t have a core?\u201d Harry is getting more used to wands and all aspects of magic under Mrs. Zabini\u2019s tutelage, and he can feel that this stick is too light.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Zabini nods. \u201cInstead of the core, you fill the wand with a spell of your choosing. It can be defensive or offensive. Then you carry the wand, and if you\u2019re Disarmed or otherwise trapped, perhaps magically exhausted, you can break the holder wand, and that spell will stream out and do as you tell it to do. Shield you, or blow something up, or kill someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows. \u201cHow can it hold a spell if it\u2019s non-magical itself? Wouldn\u2019t the spell destroy it in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mrs. Zabini says, \u201cbecause of a spell cast on the trees that they grow them on. I want you to think carefully about what spell you\u2019ll put into this one, Harry. Make sure that you pick one that would serve you well in a tight spot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll be in one now that I have you and Blaise guarding me?\u201d Harry asks, but the joke falls flat. Mrs. Zabini gives him a solemn look and leans across the table to press her fingers gently into his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the Dark Lord has given up yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise\u2019s voice is deep and uncertain. Harry leans his head around his bedroom door. Blaise is biting his lip and staring at his wand, turning it over and over in his hands. Harry pads out to join him, smiling a little as Blaise\u2019s eyes skim over his bare chest. Harry\u2019s only wearing his pyjama bottoms, since he was getting ready to go to bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise looks up at him. \u201cI can Apparate now. I was still a bit uncertain at first, but I\u2019ve corrected the last of the difficulties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry let his smile widen. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise turns fully to face him. His eyes are bright, but they dull a second later. Harry tenses. He\u2019s afraid that some shattering revelation is going to follow, although at least he\u2019s managed to convince himself that every time Blaise looks sorrowful, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s about to tell Harry he doesn\u2019t love him any longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could go to the villa that we spent time at last summer,\u201d Blaise whispers.</p>\n<p>It takes a minute for Harry to remember what he means, and when he does, he feels hot blushes break out all down his neck. They went to that villa last summer because Blaise didn\u2019t want to have sex with Harry in his mum\u2019s house.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014you\u2019re sure?\u201d Of course Harry wants to be with Blaise; they didn\u2019t get enough time together this term, and there\u2019s only so many times that Harry felt comfortable sneaking down to the Slytherin common room in his Invisibility Cloak. But from the way that Blaise is tense and keeps turning his wand around, there\u2019s something more to this, something he hasn\u2019t mentioned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am.\u201d Blaise meets his gaze hard on and says, in a sudden exhalation of air, \u201cCome with me. <em>Be </em>with me, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. \u201cTonight? Did you tell your mum where we\u2019re going so she doesn\u2019t rip apart the country looking for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and she\u2019s carefully pretending not to know anything about <em>why </em>we\u2019re going.\u201d Blaise tries to give him a commanding look, but it comes out pleading. \u201cCome with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leans over and put his hand in Blaise\u2019s. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The waterfall in the bedroom of the villa where Blaise wants to have sex with Harry is as beautiful as ever, the soft sound soothing. Blaise stands in front of it and listens to it, rather than the sounds of Harry preparing in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Now he wonders if he was too quick. He and Harry will have years, after all. They could wait. Harry chose to come with him anyway, but Harry tries so hard, all the time, to make everyone happy. What if he was only saying he wants this because he knew how much it meant to Blaise, rather than because he <em>wants </em>to?</p>\n<p>Blaise shudders at the thought. He would rather wait five years than have Harry unwilling.</p>\n<p>But the impulse that made him ask Harry in the first place is still with him. It started earlier today, when Mother gave Harry the holder wand and told him that she doubts the Dark Lord has given up. It was actually easy for Blaise to ignore the Dark Lord for a while, because he hasn\u2019t tried to kill Harry in months and the attacks are distant. But what if the Dark Lord is only lying low while he plans, and then he\u2019ll come roaring back and do his best to kill Harry?</p>\n<p>Blaise is proud of how much magic he knows, how much skill he has for his age, but precisely because he knows himself this well, he knows that he can\u2019t stand in front of the Dark Lord. He\u2019ll be blown away if he tries. Harry might stand a chance, but only because of the incredible luck that has saved him other times, or the sacrificial magic that his mother created and he told Blaise about. He\u2019ll lose in a straight duel.</p>\n<p>They might not have years, for all that Blaise wants to think they will. What if he\u2019s been fooling himself? What happens if they never have anything but these few months, for both of them?</p>\n<p>Blaise wants to grab hold of Harry and never let go. That\u2019s what Mother did, how she lived, in the short years she had with Father before his murder. And that\u2019s why she gave her blessing when Blaise asked for it this evening, after looking into his face for a long, silent moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need this to bring back your peace, and to bring joy to both yourself and Harry,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYes, go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise turns around as the bathroom door opens and Harry steps out. He\u2019s naked, and although it\u2019s far from the first time they\u2019ve seen each other like that, his bravery in looking like that in front of someone still dressed in robes takes Blaise\u2019s breath away. Harry is blushing, his skin so brilliant a pink that Blaise is reminded of how pale he normally looks. But his cock is hard, and his eyes, full of desire, fixed on Blaise.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you,\u201d Harry says, and then stops there, as if he doesn\u2019t know how to go on.</p>\n<p><em>More likely, he needs me to show that I do, too, </em>Blaise thinks, and begins to undo the buttons of the dark blue robes that his mother gave him for Christmas.</p>\n<p>He thought Harry might offer to help, but instead, he stands in one place, his breath fast and shallow, and watches as Blaise\u2019s skin is revealed. Blaise doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s his imagination that Harry\u2019s eyes grow wider and darker, and that his cock bobs. He even takes a sudden step forwards, as if he\u2019s going to reach out, but stops before he can lift his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Those simple words fall into the uneasy mood of the bedroom and create ripples that relax Blaise. He smiles at Harry and begins to undress a bit more teasingly, shrugging the robes off his shoulders with sinuous movements. Harry\u2019s eyes are so huge that it looks as though they might be half his face by the time Blaise sheds the robes, and the pants he\u2019s wearing underneath them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you prepare yourself?\u201d Blaise asks, crossing the few meters of plush carpet between them to take Harry\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is hoarse, and he\u2019s looking at Blaise\u2019s chest instead of his face, which pleases Blaise rather than otherwise. \u201cYeah, I\u2014did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Blaise whispers. \u201cI do know some spells that I\u2019ll still use, and of course I want you to stop me at once and tell me if it hurts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks up and shakes himself, settling back into a slightly more normal mindset. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I can take some pain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause you <em>any</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry loses the offended Gryffindor persona a minute later, and bites his lip. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says, so softly that Blaise almost can\u2019t hear him. \u201cI\u2014of course. I love you, Blaise.\u201d And he leans in to kiss him.</p>\n<p>Blaise takes his shoulders, and kisses him back, and guides him towards the bed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Now that he\u2019s actually on his back in the bed underneath Blaise, Harry can feel his nervousness returning, hammering like a Snitch\u2019s wings in his throat and chest. Blaise is going to take his virginity.</p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t be ridiculous, </em>he tells himself a second later. He\u2019s had sex with Blaise plenty of times before. They never went this far, sure, but that was mainly because of lack of time and space and privacy at Hogwarts. Even the Room of Requirement never felt like it was enough.</p>\n<p>But although Harry is nervous, he also wouldn\u2019t give up the sight of Blaise heading towards him and sliding a slow, reverent hand down Harry\u2019s chest, to his groin and his cock. He tilts his head back with a long sigh when Blaise\u2019s hand wraps around his shaft.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise that I\u2019ll be gentle,\u201d Blaise whispers.</p>\n<p>The words make Harry smile. \u201cYeah, I know. You promised already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Blaise leans back with a smile and then climbs onto the bed and kneels next to Harry. He waves his wand with the most handsome expression of concentration on his face. Harry is leaning up to kiss him when he feels the spells take effect, and gasps. Suddenly he\u2019s\u2014well, he\u2019s cold and loose and slick, and Blaise reaches down and glides two fingers into him like it\u2019s nothing, something that Harry knew he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do just a little while ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry that it feels unsettling,\u201d Blaise murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s like that for everyone at first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry only nods, squinting his eyes a little. The fingers are slowly pumping in and out of him, and it doesn\u2019t feel as painful or strange as he expected. On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like to have Blaise\u2019s cock in him, and he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cFound it,\u201d Blaise says a second before pleasure turns on Harry\u2019s nerves like all the candles in the Great Hall coming to life at once.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d Harry gasps, and he slams his eyes shut so he can concentrate on the sensation himself. God, Blaise is finding all sorts of things Harry never knew existed. He begins to force himself back onto Blaise\u2019s fingers. Blaise laughs quietly and holds them stiff, and Harry keeps on pushing himself back. It\u2019s wonderful, although after a few seconds the pleasure dims as Blaise moves his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Harry demands, snapping his eyes open again so he can glare at Blaise. \u201cBring them back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine how good it\u2019s going to feel when something bigger is in there,\u201d Blaise says. He\u2019s stroking his cock slowly. It gleams with a slick sheen that it definitely didn\u2019t have a few minutes ago, either. One of the spells Blaise cast must have been lube on there.</p>\n<p>Harry nods. He just hopes that Blaise will fuck him and hit his prostate\u2014which he knew about but never experienced before\u2014on every stroke. It would be unbearable to know that he could feel that good and not get to.</p>\n<p>And now, he kind of wonders why he and Blaise waited as long as they did. Why was he so afraid of something that felt so good? He even knew it would, from some discreet reading he did. And he loves Blaise. He trusts him.</p>\n<p>But from the way Blaise\u2019s hands shake as he reaches out and grips Harry\u2019s hips, Harry\u2019s not the only one who might have had some problems with nervousness. Harry reaches up and trails his fingers gently down Blaise\u2019s neck. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers in reassurance.</p>\n<p>Blaise nods, and slides in.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Only the fact that Harry looks as if he\u2019s caught in a fireworks display of pleasure, his eyes wide and his mouth gaping with delight, enables Blaise to go on. He simply doesn\u2019t want to hurt Harry, but he\u2019s also read that pain is all but inevitable with the first time between two men.</p>\n<p>Harry has had enough spells cast on him, though, and the lube that he added to himself in the bathroom, that maybe he\u2019s really not hurting. He squirms around and tries to get more of Blaise\u2019s cock like he\u2019s not, anyway. And then he looks up when Blaise is part of the way inside and raises an eyebrow and asks, \u201cThat\u2019s <em>all</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise scowls at him and pushes the rest of the way inside. Harry gasps, but he\u2019s also shifting his hips with a thoughtful expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood enough, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you <em>good enough</em>,\u201d Blaise says darkly, caught up in the spirit of competition that Harry doesn\u2019t bring into their bedroom all the time but which is delicious when he does, and then moves the way he\u2019s dreamed of doing.</p>\n<p>Harry clasps his hands and leans up to kiss him, although as it happens, it\u2019s while Blaise is in the midst of a thrust, so their chins bump more than anything. Harry laughs, but not in a mocking way, and kisses his chin instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, fuck me,\u201d he says, and lifts his hips in invitation.</p>\n<p>Blaise does, still dazed, still in a wonder that he attracted someone like <em>this</em>. Harry beams at him, and his eyes sparkle, and he makes joking remarks that have stutters and cut-off breaths in the middle of them, and it\u2019s all so <em>Harry</em> that Blaise is laughing himself, before the end.</p>\n<p>Their orgasms catch them both by surprise. Harry hisses and squeezes down on Blaise in a marvelous, intolerable way, coming all over his chest. Blaise has exactly two frantic heartbeats to feel smug before he comes himself, and fills Harry up, and the warmth leaving him makes him feel even dizzier than he has.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Harry says contentedly, as Blaise drops straight down on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Blaise breathes out, and then kisses Harry again, his hands curling into Harry\u2019s hair, then along his shoulders, down his ribs, feeling sweat-soaked curls and slick muscle and delicate skin, all of it.</p>\n<p>He has Harry, here, now, in this moment. If he never has more than that, still, they were here, and no one can change the past so that they weren\u2019t.</p>\n<p>And in this moment, Blaise is breath-stoppingly, heart-scorchingly, world-shatteringly happy.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, my boy. I\u2019d like to speak to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry raises one eyebrow. He\u2019s been at the Weasleys\u2019 for about an hour, and there\u2019s still gifts to open and jokes to listen to and pranks to watch out for, but Dumbledore has come through the Floo and wants to talk to him, so Harry supposes he has to. He gets up and follows Dumbledore into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>The moment the door closes behind them, Dumbledore waves his wand, and Vanishes the illusion spell on his right arm. Harry blinks. This time, the blackness has crawled all the way up towards his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI found and destroyed another Horcrux,\u201d Dumbledore answers tightly. \u201cThis one was hidden within Hogwarts. The protections on it were not of the same order as those on the first one I found, but still vicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs and looks up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to survive this curse, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Which is why I have come to ask you, one more time, to join the quest, and destroy them for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t destroy them without being wounded, they\u2019d kill me. I won\u2019t do that to the people who love me.\u201d Faces swarm through his head, and two of them aren\u2019t white. \u201cIf it\u2019s actually easy to destroy them with the proper precautions, then you should be able to take them, or tell other people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore closes his eyes. \u201cThere is no one else I trust as much.\u201d</p>\n<p>That would touch Harry if it didn\u2019t come across to him as just another manipulation tactic. He shakes his head. \u201cNo, sir. Tell Professor Snape, or Tonks, or anyone else who\u2019s part of the Order. But not me.\u201d He turns towards the kitchen door.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you considered that Voldemort will almost certainly come after you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. But that\u2019s not the same thing as having to destroy the Horcruxes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are many things you do not know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s tongue burns with the temptation to say that he <em>does </em>know about the prophecy, but he won\u2019t betray Sirius like that. He only shakes his head at Dumbledore and says, \u201cSince I didn\u2019t have to die to remove the Horcrux, I choose life,\u201d then walks out and back into the hustle and bustle of gifts and lights and noise and music and life.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll return this evening to a villa in Florence that isn\u2019t as bright or noisy, but is still a living place.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s had enough of death.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t even tell me what the damn Horcruxes that he\u2019d destroyed <em>were</em>. He has to keep it so close all the time, like everyone\u2019s going to betray him if he doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise lets one hand rest on Harry\u2019s forehead, and Harry closes his eyes. The scar there has turned into just an ordinary scar now, a bit of rough skin, and Blaise moves his fingers slowly over it. Harry yawns and stretches out his legs. They\u2019re in the garden of Mrs. Zabini\u2019s villa, and it\u2019s a milder day than anything in Britain right now, with soft sun.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d Blaise asks, in a soft rumble.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry turns and presses his face into the corner of Blaise\u2019s robe. He\u2019s had his head in Blaise\u2019s lap for the past hour, and it just seems so normal and right and accepted. He never wants to move away. \u201cOnly that I don\u2019t understand him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d Blaise\u2019s fingers seek out the back of Harry\u2019s neck and massage it, and Harry gives a slight gasp and relaxes. \u201cDon\u2019t think about him anymore. Think, instead, of how we\u2019re going back to Hogwarts tomorrow, and you\u2019ll work hard on your Defense spells so Snape doesn\u2019t find anything to criticize, and I\u2019m going to start teaching you Italian\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Harry pops an eye open, although since it\u2019s entirely hidden by cloth, it doesn\u2019t make much difference and he doesn\u2019t think Blaise notices.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Even if we split our time between Britain and Italy after we graduate from Hogwarts, I am going to make sure that you can speak it properly. And it means that you don\u2019t have to feel confined to the villas or always make sure Mother and I are with you if you want to go outside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry reaches up and clasps Blaise\u2019s wrist. He hasn\u2019t said anything about feeling trapped, because honestly he hasn\u2019t, but that\u2019s Blaise\u2019s genius, anticipating ahead of time that he might and making sure he doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>Blaise drops his head and leaves a kiss on Harry\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a book of Italian poetry when the spring comes. We can translate it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs, and feels as though contentment has seeped into his body along with the sunlight.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry waits uneasily by the fireplace in the Gryffindor common room. It\u2019s midnight, long after most of the others have gone to sleep, and Harry is a little worried that one of the prefects will unexpectedly happen downstairs and order him to bed. But he has to do this. He has to know. Sirius sent him an urgent message saying he wanted to talk to Harry, and only Harry. Harry agreed, although he\u2019s going to remind Sirius that he\u2019ll just tell Blaise everything later anyway.</p>\n<p>The fireplace abruptly lights, and Harry sighs a little. \u201cSirius?\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Harry.\u201d Sirius grins at him. He doesn\u2019t seem upset or hurt or sick. Part of Harry that\u2019s always waiting for disaster relaxes\u2014partially. \u201cI wanted to let you know that I found and destroyed a Horcrux!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Harry blinks. That\u2019s the last news he expected. \u201cDid Dumbledore finally tell someone else where they are and how to find one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius shakes his head. \u201cI actually wouldn\u2019t have known about it at all, but\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about our last conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods slowly. He just hopes that conversation didn\u2019t have <em>bad</em> consequences. He\u2019s so used to people not listening to him, not doing what he says, or deciding that they disbelieve him and going and doing something stupid instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cI realized that I wasn\u2019t thinking much,\u201d Sirius says with a gusty sigh, and his head bobs around for a second like he\u2019s stretching out in front of the fireplace to get more comfortable. \u201cI\u2019d let Albus do all my thinking for me. I didn\u2019t write good letters to you last summer. I thought too little about what it meant that you had that curse on you and Albus <em>could</em> have helped you, but didn\u2019t. And I looked at myself and didn\u2019t much like what I saw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says. That sounds positive. He\u2019s almost glad that Blaise isn\u2019t here right now, because he would be pointing out all the ways it\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd one of those things I changed was the treatment of Kreacher.\u201d Sirius wrinkles his nose. \u201cHe was dirty, but sure, I was dirty when I was living on the run, too. And he worships my mother, but I used to do the same thing when I was a kid, before I realized how awful she was. So I started trying to treat him more kindly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles a little. \u201cGood. That should have happened a long time ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius doesn\u2019t dismiss him, just nods. \u201cAnd then one day, he showed me this locket that he said Regulus risked his life to get\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegulus?\u201d Harry knows Sirius has talked about that name before, but the memory is distant for Harry, buried underneath all the things that have happened to him in the past eighteen months. \u201cYour brother?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. The Death Eater. Except now it turns out he\u2019s the Death Eater who turned on Voldemort in the end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d is all Harry can think of to say. He thought Snape was the only one, and Snape was a special case, since he doesn\u2019t really bother not <em>acting </em>like a Death Eater from day to day. \u201cHe found the Horcrux?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius nods. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but he did something that meant he switched the real Horcrux with a fake locket, and then he told Kreacher to leave him there and escape with the Horcrux. Kreacher wanted to destroy it to honor Regulus\u2019s memory, but he didn\u2019t know how. Of course nothing he tried worked. House-elves command powerful magic, but it\u2019s usually not that Dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did <em>you </em>destroy it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA spell that you don\u2019t need to know the name of\u2014\u201d Sirius catches Harry\u2019s eye, and abruptly grins. \u201cAll right, yes, you do. I should know better than to think I could get away with that. It\u2019s called Fiendfyre. A powerful Dark curse where the flames are sentient and try to escape your control all the time. I doubt I could have controlled it without my rage at what happened to little Reggie powering me. And without the Dark Arts training that I received when I was a kid, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry whistles a little. He\u2019ll have to ask Blaise about Fiendfyre, but tell him the context, so that he doesn\u2019t think Harry wants to use it for himself. \u201cSo how many Horcruxes does that make, now, with the diary in second year and the one Mrs. Zabini took out of me? And the two Dumbledore destroyed\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive, as far as I know. Which means there should be two left.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. It\u2019s not like he knew that for sure, although it makes sense. Seven is a powerful magical number and Voldemort would probably want to imitate it when he made the Horcruxes. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do have one lead, actually. I remember the last time I saw my cousin Bellatrix before she and I were on opposite sides of the war officially. Some distant cousin\u2019s wedding.\u201d Sirius frowns. \u201cShe was bragging about something You-Know-Who asked her to guard, without actually saying it was him. But Bella couldn\u2019t be subtle to save her life. She peppered her speeches with all these hints.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Harry says again, blinking. \u201cAnd where do you think she put it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I had to guess? In the Lestrange vault at Gringotts. I\u2019ve already looked in all the ones available to members of the Black family, and there\u2019s nothing like that there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you even get into the Lestrange vault?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI might have an idea.\u201d Sirius\u2019s grin is wicked. \u201cLeave it up to me, though, Harry. You said you didn\u2019t want to be involved in the war, and I completely understand. This is <em>fun </em>for me, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry has to shake his head. \u201cI\u2019m mostly worried that you\u2019re going to get hurt trying to destroy them. They hurt Dumbledore pretty badly, and he\u2019s a powerful wizard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s mouth tightens. \u201cThe first Horcrux he tried to destroy was a ring, and he tried to <em>put it on</em>, the idiot. That\u2019s why it could injure him so badly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you why? I mean, why he wanted to put the ring on so badly?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius makes a disgusted sound. \u201cOf course not. And he wouldn\u2019t tell me exactly what the second one was, but he did say it was an artifact he wanted to preserve. I think he probably tried to destroy the Horcrux without destroying the object, and that meant he was more vulnerable to one of the protection spells catching hold of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head. \u201cSo it was never all that dangerous, unless you could get tempted by them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius smiles grimly. \u201cThat\u2019s one good thing about the combination of my childhood and going to prison. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be tempted by any of the Dark Arts objects I come across, no matter what they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Harry says, and looks him in the eye. \u201cI still want you to be careful. And I\u2019m telling Blaise about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will, and I don\u2019t care.\u201d Sirius winks at him, and then the green flames billow up and end the conversation. Harry leans back on his heels and sighs a little. The war against Voldemort might really be over soon, and without any of his interference.</p>\n<p>It will be wonderful, if that\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you notice that there\u2019s something wrong with Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that my line?\u201d Harry murmurs from where he\u2019s studying the scroll that Mrs. Zabini sent to him. He sent her a bunch of Ancient Runes questions, and she replied with the answers, as well as more questions that she wants him to divine the answers to and send back to her for marking.</p>\n<p>At the silence around him, Harry looks up. Ron and Hermione are exchanging serious looks, and after a second, Ron nods to her. Hermione bites her lip and then turns around to face Harry, rearranging her hands on her lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy has been really pale lately,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd spending a lot of time on the seventh floor near the Room of Requirement. And it\u2019s only happened a few times, but I\u2019ve caught him clutching his left arm, like it hurts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry blinks. He supposes that is new, although he assumed all along that Malfoy was going to get the Dark Mark. \u201cWell, probably like father, like son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t <em>have </em>to be.\u201d Hermione\u2019s face is earnest. \u201cWe could show him that there\u2019s another way. That he doesn\u2019t have to serve Voldemort if he doesn\u2019t want to. And we\u2019d like your help to go talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snorts. \u201cWhat makes you think it would help? If anything, he probably hates me even more now because I keep defeating him in Defense.\u201d Malfoy hasn\u2019t tried the Cruciatus Curse on him again, but he sure glares a lot as though he\u2019d like to cast it, and only his own self-protective instincts are holding him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust that you\u2019re the Boy-Who-Lived, and you could probably reassure him\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not properly part of the war anymore,\u201d Harry refutes with a shake of his head. \u201cI think I\u2019ll probably hurt your petition. I\u2019ll wish you good luck, though,\u201d he adds, and turns back to his scroll. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione sounds uncertain. \u201cYou\u2014you don\u2019t think that it\u2019s worth trying to stop Malfoy from being one of <em>them</em>?\u201d She lowers her voice, since they are still in the Gryffindor common room, with a few notorious gossipers sitting around. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that it\u2019s not going to work, and even if it is, Snape is probably doing a better job than we could.\u201d It hasn\u2019t escaped Harry\u2019s notice how often Snape hauls Malfoy into a corner of the Defense classroom for a \u201cchat,\u201d or tells him to stay behind when they leave class. \u201cI think probably he and Dumbledore both know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to save a soul, though.\u201d Hermione is fidgeting with the corner of her robe.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy Malfoy\u2019s soul? Why not someone else\u2019s?\u201d Harry sits back with a long stretch of his arms above his head. He\u2019s been hunched over the scroll for a while. \u201cAnd why us, instead of someone else? No, Hermione, sorry, but I just don\u2019t want to take the risk. I don\u2019t want to get involved anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d Ron interjects. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ll do it with you if you really want me to, Hermione, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change anything.\u201d He flinches a little as Hermione turns to glare at him, but holds up his head defiantly. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we could make a difference,\u201d Hermione whispers with a sigh. \u201cIt feels like this year is so quiet, and we aren\u2019t making a difference like we did the first four years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLast year was quiet, too,\u201d Harry points out. \u201cI was especially quiet.\u201d Ron guffaws, although he sits up very straight and pretends to be serious about it when Hermione glares at him again. \u201cAnd fourth year, what did we really do? Just struggle to keep me alive through the Tournament. There was nothing else that really happened until the very end.\u201d Harry swallows roughly. He still doesn\u2019t like thinking about the graveyard and Cedric, and most of his nightmares are about that, when he isn\u2019t remembering the green flash that ended his mum\u2019s life. \u201cI think you could go talk to Professor Snape if you wanted, Hermione, but otherwise we should stay out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did already. He\u2014told me to stay out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckles despite himself. Hermione looks wounded, but only until Harry shakes his head and says, \u201cAnd aren\u2019t you going to do what the nice professor tells you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHardly <em>nice</em>,\u201d Ron mutters, but he ducks expertly when Hermione tries to swat him on the back of the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Harry says, letting his eyes show just how serious he is, and looking back and forth from one of his best friends to the other. \u201cWe did more than enough when we were kids. We stopped Voldemort from resurrecting himself years earlier, figured out that there was a basilisk plaguing the school and how to stop it, and saved an innocent man from execution. If we never did anything more than that, we still would\u2019ve made a huge contribution to the war effort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione thinks about it while the fire dims behind them and Harry rolls up the scroll on his lap. It\u2019s more than clear that he\u2019s not going to get any more work done tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Hermione says finally. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to feel like we should be doing something more and not having someone <em>helping </em>us do something more, but maybe we can just wait and hope for once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry clasps her shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing more of this year. It\u2019s very restful. Now, I wanted to ask you, did you notice that more mistakes seem to be appearing in the Charms book we have this year? I don\u2019t know if Professor Flitwick chose one that was wrong or if the printer did something to them, but it\u2019s been driving me mental...\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Professor Dumbledore hasn\u2019t approached you again about destroying Horcruxes.\u201d Blaise asks the question even though he knows, or hopes, Harry would have told him at once if that was the case. He knows Harry trusts him. It\u2019s just that Harry spent years not telling even people he trusted about the secrets that are most important to him. Blaise wants to make sure he\u2019s changed.</p>\n<p>Harry nods against him. They\u2019re tucked up in a corner of the library where no one except Madam Pince seems to go on the regular, two chairs shoved together so that they can sit with their legs touching and Harry\u2019s head coiled under Blaise\u2019s chin. \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t. But I wonder if that\u2019s because Sirius succeeded in destroying the one, and then he told me last night he destroyed the other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise tenses. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks sheepish. \u201cSorry, I meant to. But I\u2019ve got to bed late two nights running, one with the conversation Hermione wanted to have about Malfoy and one with Sirius telling me about the one in the Lestrange vault. Then I had to run like hell to get to Potions on time this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise nods and says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d because without that kind of verbal reassurance, Harry will be worrying all day. He smooths his fingers down Harry\u2019s palm, delighting in the little shiver and gasp that wrings from him. \u201cAnd what about this rumored seventh Horcrux that Black mentioned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Harry shakes his head. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s some personal possession like the diary, and that could be anywhere. I don\u2019t have much idea about Riddle\u2019s childhood other than what the diary shade told me, and most of that could be lies.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses for a second, then rears back enough to look Blaise in the eye. \u201cWhy? Do you want to try destroying them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I <em>want</em> them destroyed, though, so the Dark Lord can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs and leans his head on Blaise\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI think it will be sooner or later. Dumbledore is probably seeking it, and if he can\u2019t find it before he dies, then he\u2019ll have to pass on the knowledge to Sirius, or maybe Snape for all I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr your friends.\u201d That\u2019s what Blaise worries about the most, that Granger and Weasley will get some secret letter from Dumbledore or a bequest in his will and then drag Harry into it. Granger\u2019s already shown a distressing tendency to want to interfere in things just because she successfully interfered in the past.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about them, Blaise.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is low and firm. \u201cThey might want to, but even if they do decide to take off into the wilderness for some reason, I won\u2019t go with them. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise closes his eyes and nods. He\u2019s never wanted to make Harry choose between his friends and their love, but it\u2019s comforting to know that Harry takes his promises seriously, and will, at the very least, choose safety over danger.</p>\n<p>They finish up their essays and leave the library, walking side-by-side with their hands occasionally brushing. They don\u2019t get many scowls or stares now, except from the most stubborn of the Gryffindors who still believe the lies the <em>Prophet </em>spreads about Harry. Blaise frowns as he thinks about that. Harry also forbade him from trying to take vengeance on the editors of the paper, small-minded petty fear-mongerers though they are.</p>\n<p>Harry catches the frown and stops to rake his fingers gently through Blaise\u2019s fringe, pushing it out of the way. \u201cHey,\u201d he whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the Easter holiday. We\u2019ll have that week together, and then we can start planning for the summer\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>A giant explosion rocks the school, so enormous that the whole building seems to lurch sideways. Blaise clutches at a wall and stares up at the cloud of smoke and ruin rising outside the windows. There\u2019s the smell of fire, and the horrible ringing sensation in the back of his head that <em>something </em>has gone wrong, <em>something </em>that should be singing is silent, <em>something </em>that should be alive is dead.</p>\n<p>Harry, beside him, goes still and stares out the windows at the fire with savage intensity. \u201cVoldemort,\u201d he breathes. \u201cThat\u2019s what he was doing. Gathering up the power and followers to launch an attack on the wards of the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he begins to run.</p>\n<p>Blaise, luckily, is half-waiting for that, on edge as he already was from the discussion of Weasley and Granger possibly taking off to hunt Horcruxes. He reaches out and snatches Harry\u2019s arm, pulling him back and swinging him around. Harry is tugging at his hold before he can speak. \u201cLet me <em>go</em>, people could be in danger\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that about choosing safety over danger as long as you\u2019re with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth works for an instant, and then he sighs and steps back, nodding curtly. \u201cFine. I\u2019m sorry. I just\u2014\u201d He glances out the window. The smoke is roiling in clouds that tell Blaise part of the fire must be Fiendfyre by now, and there are screams distant and near and soft and loud. \u201cI want to help people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Blaise says firmly. \u201cBut while we\u2019re probably better-trained than most of the students in the school, we\u2019re not of age yet and we\u2019re not going to fight him. We\u2019ll find the professors and you can tell them anything you think they need to know, and then we\u2019re going to the Room of Requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. Blaise doesn\u2019t have to tell him that being down in Slytherin while Harry\u2019s up in Gryffindor Tower isn\u2019t something Blaise will tolerate. \u201cRight.\u201d He still gives the smoke in the window a slightly wistful glance before he lets Blaise lead him away.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They find Dumbledore in the middle of the central staircase, his arms spread wide, directing traffic. His booming voice appears to come from the walls instead of his mouth. \u201cStudents, return to your common rooms and stay there. Professors, to me on the third floor. We will plan the defense of Hogwarts. Students, return to your common rooms and stay there. Professors...\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses when he sees them and nods to them wearily. It\u2019s obvious to Harry that he doesn\u2019t expect them to help. Harry just asks outright. \u201cSir, is there any hope of defeating Voldemort when he attacks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore sighs a little. \u201cNot when he still has at least one object tethering him to immortality,\u201d he says, which is so direct that Harry sags a little against Blaise. \u201cI know what Sirius has done, but we still lack the seventh. It might be his snake, Nagini. But I am not certain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you expect to fight him and die,\u201d Blaise says, in a tone that says what he thinks of that plan.</p>\n<p>\u201cEither that, or destroy his snake and die,\u201d Dumbledore says, with a slight nod. \u201cSomeone else will have to destroy Voldemort.\u201d For a second, his eyes dart to Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the training to destroy Voldemort,\u201d Harry says. He glances at Blaise. \u201cBut what do you think about destroying Nagini?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise gives a long sigh that seems to start from the very bottom of his soul and whirl up around it and out his mouth. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to give this a rest, are you, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really, no,\u201d Harry says, and then grins in a way that he knows startles Blaise. \u201cBut I said that I would choose safety, so that means taking someone with me.\u201d He raises his wand and calls out the same spell that he did two years ago in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. \u201c<em>Accio Firebolt!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The broom speeds towards him and then slows down so that he can grasp the shaft. Dumbledore is staring as if he doesn\u2019t believe his eyes and isn\u2019t sure he wants to. Harry leaps up onto the broom and then stretches out a hand to Blaise.</p>\n<p>Blaise eyes him and then the broom. \u201cCan that thing carry two people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course! It\u2019ll be a little slower than normal, but it\u2019s pretty fast already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, you mental person,\u201d Blaise mutters, and then leaps up. Harry pulls him at the same time as he casts a Lightening Charm in Blaise\u2019s direction. The last thing he wants to do is have Blaise hang like dead weight from his hand. He\u2019s sturdy enough that it would hurt.</p>\n<p>Blaise catches his breath as he drifts up behind Harry and lands on the broom. Then he winds his hands around Harry\u2019s waist, and Harry nods at Dumbledore and says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go kill Nagini. Then you go kill him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, I do not even know if Nagini is the last\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, at least losing her will be <em>really </em>bad for his morale,\u201d Harry says cheerfully, and then he and Blaise fly out the nearest broken window and towards the fire.</p>\n<p>It takes all of Harry\u2019s skill to steer the double-loaded Firebolt through clouds of smoke, flying curses, drifting patches of stench, and swooping figures that look like conjured hawks towards Voldemort. But Harry knows where he\u2019ll be as if the link in his scar is still active and pulling him. Or maybe he just knows the cowardly bastard and his tendency to lurk at the back of his troops well by now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you want to do this?\u201d Blaise shouts in his ear as they twirl past the Whomping Willow, which is frantically trying to strike out at the Death Eaters while burning. Harry casts <em>Aguamenti</em> to dump a ton of water on it and hopes that helps. It\u2019s out of sight in the next moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI owe him for the Parseltongue curse!\u201d Harry shouts.</p>\n<p>After a second, Blaise nods. He must know as well as Harry that this is their best chance, their last chance, to get revenge on Voldemort. They certainly haven\u2019t been anywhere close to him since that night in the graveyard.</p>\n<p>The broom twists some more over the battlefield, and then Harry sees Voldemort. He\u2019s unmistakable, even with the dark hood of his cloak pulled over his face. He\u2019s taller than almost anyone else, and his white hand gestures wildly in the air from where he stands atop a slight hill near the Forbidden Forest. Nagini is coiled at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrepare a shield for me!\u201d Harry yells over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Portable <em>Protego</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! That one!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s wand is already glowing with the overpowered Shattering Curse that Mrs. Zabini taught him over Christmas. He stoops down towards Voldemort. Blaise is muttering quietly behind him, readying the Shield Charm.</p>\n<p>Nagini is the one who sees them first. She uncoils, her head flinging back. Harry can see the gleam of venom on her fangs and knows that it would be a <em>really </em>stupid idea to get close enough to let her bite him.</p>\n<p>Harry aims the Shattering Curse directly at the middle of her, while Blaise holds up the shield, projecting from his wand, so that it covers their sides and the broom.</p>\n<p>The Shattering Curse lands in the middle of Nagini\u2014and things fail to happen. Harry curses as he realizes that she\u2019s still alive and not in bits all over the ground. He turns the Firebolt as hard as he can, skimming over the side of the hill.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise screams it in his ear just before the spell from Voldemort\u2019s wand lands and makes short work of their shield. Harry hears a ringing noise in his ear, he feels something like overpowered bits of magic fly past him, and then he\u2019s rolling on the grass with Blaise right behind him, cutting his hands on splinters of wood.</p>\n<p>His Firebolt. His Firebolt is <em>gone.</em></p>\n<p>Harry hardly has time to absorb that before he whips around and sees Nagini slithering straight at him. In desperation, his hand goes to his pocket, and he pulls out the holder wand that Mrs. Zabini gave him for Christmas.</p>\n<p>She charged it with a spell. Harry didn\u2019t want her to, argued against it, but she told him that it was for his protection, and that he could replace it with another spell as soon as he wanted to.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Harry\u2019s almost forgotten it since they\u2019ve been at Hogwarts. It isn\u2019t dangerous at the school when you stay out of shit the way he has been this year, and he certainly didn\u2019t anticipate finding himself in a corner after a duel in Defense or something like that.</p>\n<p>But now\u2014</p>\n<p>Harry holds the wand in both hands as Nagini slithers towards him. He can hear Blaise yelling at him, but then Blaise shuts up even before Nagini gets in range, maybe because he remembers the spell his mother put in the holder wand as well as Harry does.</p>\n<p>Harry breaks the wand as Nagini lunges for him, mouth wide open.</p>\n<p>The brilliant green light of the Killing Curse fills the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Harry can feel, for a second, an incredibly cold wave of power pass over his hands, and he hears Mrs. Zabini\u2019s voice whispering, as though she stood beside him, \u201c<em>Avada Kedavra.</em>\u201d And it strikes Harry as wonderful, in a way, that the spell that killed his blood mother is now going to save him when cast by the wand of his adoptive one.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment when everything seems to fill the world with light, and Harry almost wonders if another Killing Curse has flown the same way and caught him, too. Then he looks down, and finds Nagini motionless on the battlefield in front of him.</p>\n<p><em>The Killing Curse works on living Horcruxes, if she was one, </em>Harry thinks, and swallows. <em>Thank Merlin.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry jerks his head up. Voldemort is stalking towards him, hood pulled back now so that those red eyes can burn into him. Harry feels a surge of the terror he did in the graveyard, when Voldemort bound his voice with the Parseltongue curse, but he buries it. He\u2019s tougher now than he was two years ago, and he\u2019s been through a hell of a lot more. He readies his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know what you have <em>done</em>?\u201d Voldemort\u2019s voice spirals up into a shriek like the cry of a hunting bird, and Harry is suddenly and absolutely sure that he\u2019s right, that he knows what Voldemort means, the same way he knew for sure that Fawkes and the Sorting Hat were there to help him in the Chamber in second year.</p>\n<p>\u201cDestroyed your Horcrux?\u201d Harry asks.</p>\n<p>Voldemort goes still, his eyes wide and shocked. Harry is aware that Blaise is stirring next to him, probably preparing a spell or a carefully coordinated rush off the battlefield, but he doesn\u2019t look away from Voldemort\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Yes. That\u2019s right. His seventh Horcrux is dead.</p>\n<p>Voldemort is <em>mortal.</em></p>\n<p>Harry wants to laugh and charge him, but Blaise hisses right in his ear, \u201cYou <em>promised </em>me,\u201d and Harry manages to step back with a sigh. Besides, he can see a white-robed figure hurrying towards them across the battlefield, and he reckons that Dumbledore is on the way to keep his own promise.</p>\n<p>Harry steps back, feeling Blaise\u2019s arm coil around his waist. He wouldn\u2019t even dare to do that much, but Voldemort has noticed Dumbledore now. He\u2019s turning to face him, his hood billowing behind him, his eyes full of hatred.</p>\n<p>Harry wonders for a second if Voldemort will flee, which would be a terrible thing, but then realizes that Voldemort doesn\u2019t know that the rest of his Horcruxes have been destroyed. It\u2019s one thing for his enemies to be aware of them and another thing to realize that they\u2019ve tracked down all of them.</p>\n<p>And the Death Eaters are here, watching, an army of them. Voldemort probably doesn\u2019t dare make his followers think he\u2019s a coward or afraid of losing.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get <em>out </em>of here,\u201d Blaise insists in a whisper.</p>\n<p>Harry casts a powerful Disillusionment Charm that will hide both of them, and they do.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius says he\u2019ll buy me a new Firebolt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good. I was so worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leans his head back and laughs. Once again, they\u2019re in the garden at Mother\u2019s villa, and Harry has his head in Blaise\u2019s lap. But Blaise feels so much lighter than he did at Christmas that there\u2019s no comparison. The Dark Lord is gone, and if Dumbledore is the hero of the hour and everyone seems to be confused that Harry didn\u2019t defeat him, that only means he has more time to spend with Blaise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have been, you wanker. What kind of Dark-Arts-proficient Slytherin can\u2019t even hold a Shield Charm that can save a broom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise leans down and kisses Harry instead of answering. Harry gasps and reaches up a hand to clutch at his hair.</p>\n<p>Blaise cradles Harry\u2019s head in his arms and bends down further, ignoring the pain in his neck, reveling in the fact that he can kiss Harry for as long as he likes and no one is going to come after them.</p>\n<p>No one will separate them. They might have a funeral to attend in a few months, Albus Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, but in the end, Blaise can\u2019t even resent the old man that much. He did what he should have done from the beginning, and he protected the school well enough that there were only injured students, no dead ones.</p>\n<p>Blaise will go, and pay his respects, and know that, in the end, he\u2019s the one who won.</p>\n<p>Him and Harry.</p>\n<p>\n<b>The End.</b>\n</p>"
