  "text": "<p>\n<em>High school is more exhausting than Eve expected.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s not like Eve has been outright hazed or anything \u2013 in fact, people seem to be largely ignoring her, too focused on getting through the day themselves. But it\u2019s tiring, constantly trying to act normal and make friends, and she\u2019s absolutely ready for it to be over. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Thankfully, she\u2019s made a friend \u2013 a pretty girl named Ruby, who saw the tiny rainbow sticker on her binder and smiled in 2<sup>nd</sup> period. There\u2019s even a few people who are <strong>out</strong> in 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grade. Maybe this school won\u2019t be so bad, she reasons. It\u2019s certainly better than 8<sup>th</sup> grade so far \u2013 the halls are clean, and the food is better. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The second-last class of the day is one she\u2019s been dreading \u2013 combined Chem and Physics. Two horrible subjects and way too much math - she\u2019s just going to grit her teeth, take some notes, and try to get through it. But that all goes out the window as she almost trips over her own feet when she sees the teacher. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The woman in question has dark hair and pale skin, and she\u2019s dressed to the nines in a crisp blue dress, a tight bun, and sharp heels, rocking up slightly on her toes to write something on the whiteboard. She hasn\u2019t even turned around, but it\u2019s clear by the distracting shape of her hips that this is going to be a long, tortuous semester if it\u2019s going to be spent pretending that she doesn\u2019t now immediately have a huge crush on her teacher. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>She\u2019s about to try to steal a seat near the back when she spots a second woman who is also definitely not a student \u2013 tall and lean, with her hair half-up and half-down in blonde curls. She leans against the lab table at the front in slacks and a tweed blazer, one button conspicuously done up wrong on her shirt. Judging by her age and the whiteboard marker in her hand, she\u2019s a teacher too.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Two teachers. Two hot teachers. Two hot teachers who keep stealing glances at each other, giving Eve a strange feeling in her chest.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yeah\u2026definitely sitting at the back.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>She\u2019s just settling in when she sees her new friend come through the door and grab a seat, turning around to call her over. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEve, over here! We can sit together!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh no.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s at the front. Ruby wants to sit at the <strong>front</strong>. She has no choice but to follow, slumping into the seat beside her friend and trying not to stare at either of the women at the front of the room. She focuses on to board instead \u2013 it reads \u201cMiss Luthor\u201d in tidy writing on the left, and \u201cMiss Danvers\u201d in messier writing on the right. She can guess which is which. </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Previously, she'd thought that a 'Miss Danvers' taught Bio. </em> <em>She had actually enjoyed that class \u2013 the teacher she had thought was Miss Danvers was funny, and nice, with short auburn hair and a pretty smile. She was easy to listen to even when she was talking about amino acids. <strong>This</strong> is clearly a different person. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Soon, the blonde teacher clears up the confusion by reaching up with a grin and adding an extra line underneath her name \u2013 \u201cThe Younger\u201d. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Right. Two different teachers with the same name. </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>W</em> <em>hy are there so many hot teachers at this school?</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>When the bell finally rings and everyone has settled, the two women share a look and a smile before Miss Danvers moves forward, clapping her hands and rubbing them together.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAlright, everyone. Who\u2019s ready to get to learning?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLena! Wait up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena rolls her eyes, her clicking heels keeping the same even pace as she hears the telltale <em>clomp</em> of those familiar scuffed Oxfords jogging on the linoleum behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d Lena asks, opening her purse and pretending to rifle through it, if only to have something to do with her hands as the footsteps get closer. Finally she produces a manila folder that she absolutely doesn\u2019t need, flipping through it with what she hopes is very convincing feigned interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re going to the same place?\u201d Finally the footsteps catch up with her, and Lena fights against the reliable swoop her stomach does as Kara Danvers falls into step, slightly breathless and grinning. \u201cCat\u2019s office, right? I saw you were CC\u2019d on the email.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena sighs, conceding the point. She had also noticed Kara\u2019s name in the email, and she\u2019d been hoping to get to Cat\u2019s office first so that she could settle herself for the irritating effect Kara\u2019s presence always seems to have on her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t get rid of you now, can I?\u201d she says, her tone intentionally light, and Kara laughs. Her blue eyes crinkle at the corners, and she runs a hand through her messy blonde curls, and there\u2019s a twist in Lena\u2019s gut that has nothing to do with the nerves she\u2019s feeling about being called into her boss\u2019 office before the school year has even started.</p>\n<p>Kara has had this effect \u2013 this sweet, heart -pounding, infuriating, <em>distracting</em> effect \u2013 ever since the day Lena started this job, fresh from university and full of nerves about teaching physics to high school students. Lena had been in her small office and about to work herself into a full-blown panic attack when someone sporting an incredibly messy bun had poked their head in, looking concerned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the strange, disheveled\u00a0woman asks, stepping inside the almost-empty office and putting a gentle hand on Lena\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI heard someone hyperventilating in here and I had a flashback to my first day.\u201d The woman seems to be about Lena\u2019s age, and she looks like a cross between a hippie and a fortune-teller \u2013 the messy hair is paired with solid-framed glasses, a bulky handmade wool sweater, a beanie, and a brightly-coloured woven blanket draped around her shoulders. There\u2019s a pencil stuck in her bun, and her eyes are kind.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Lena reacts immediately, furiously wiping her eyes and trying to even out her breathing. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just nerves,\u201d she says tersely, and the woman nods in understanding.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDo you need some water or anything?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d Lena waits a few moments for the woman to leave, but she seems content to keep leaning against Lena\u2019s desk, rubbing small, calm circles on Lena's back. Against her instincts, Lena starts to find it the tiniest bit soothing. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>So, of course, she shrugs the hand off.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d Lena blurts out in a horrific attempt to draw attention away from the move, and the woman looks slightly startled. Embarrassed at her outburst, Lena hastily adds, \u201cI mean \u2013 is that considered work appropriate? I feel a bit overdressed.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The woman laughs easily, shaking her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t wear this when the students are here. But this wing of the school is always freezing cold. Don\u2019t tell Miss Grant, but I think the janitor forgets to turn the A/C off here in the fall.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I tell Miss Grant?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want the janitor to lose her job!\u201d the woman says as if it\u2019s the obvious answer, and Lena blinks, unsure how to handle the unbridled optimism.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m Kara, by the way,\u201d she continues, holding a warm hand out to shake. Lena accepts it, feeling Kara\u2019s fingers fold firmly over hers. Her gut pulls in a way that, while alarming, definitely distracts her from her nerves. Now that they\u2019re standing so close it\u2019s clear that Kara is as attractive as she is eclectic \u2013 her eyes are bright behind her thick frames, her smile clear and genuine. Her jawline is as strong as her hands, and kindness seems to radiate from her.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLena,\u201d she answers, still too overwhelmed to do anything but blink into Kara\u2019s well-proportioned face.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Lena,\u201d Kara says quietly, with a smile that seems private. Like it\u2019s just for them. It burrows straight into Lena\u2019s chest, and she\u2019s opening her mouth to find some lame reply just to keep Kara from leaving when Kara finally stands, rubbing her hands together. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay, I\u2019m going to go get ready. My classroom is just next door if you need anything!\u201d Kara points at a door Lena hadn\u2019t noticed before on the far wall. \u201cThe door has no lock, so I might come visit sometimes.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And with that, Kara is gone as suddenly as she appeared, and Lena hardly has time to get herself worked up over nerves again before her first batch of students is pouring in and she jumps in headfirst. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Later when Lena enters the staff room to see the person she now knows, after some investigation, is chemistry teacher Kara Danvers waving at her from a nearby table, she has to do a double-take. Kara has lost her bulky sweater and is now in a fitted but comfortable-looking blazer, her hair in a much tidier ponytail, and Lena starts to get the first inklings of the feelings that will later be as familiar as her own reflection.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kara had seemed to take that first interaction as an indication that Lena needed a <em>friend</em>, and she\u2019s been steadily battering Lena\u2019s defenses ever since.</p>\n<p>Now, with Kara strolling into her classroom through their adjoining door on a daily basis, it\u2019s difficult to ignore the way her heart flutters at Kara's presence. Even when the reason she\u2019s strolling in is because there\u2019s a huge smoking scorch mark on her pants or she\u2019s bleeding from the hand, and <em>\u2018the nurse\u2019s office is too far, Lena. I just need a band-aid!\u2019</em></p>\n<p>Instead, Lena just patches up whatever small injury Kara has managed to inflict on herself that day, and does everything in her power to <em>never</em> be alone with her.</p>\n<p>Usually when the halls are bustling with students and there\u2019s classes to teach and crowds to blend into, that isn\u2019t a difficult task. But now, with the only sound in the building being the blend of their echoing steps, there\u2019s nowhere for Lena to run.</p>\n<p>And with Kara looking like <em>that</em>, with her bright smile and her shirt tucked into her tight khakis and her hair loose and curly, Lena can\u2019t be held responsible for her actions.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Kara ventures, nudging Lena gently with her shoulder. \u201cHow was your summer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lena grinds out, finally putting the folder back in her bag. At Kara\u2019s expectant look, Lena sighs. \u201cI planned new lessons for this year, made some new strategies to make your students switch over to Physics, my brother told me I was wasting my potential and tried to get me to work for the family company. You know, the usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara snorts, shaking her head. \u201cFirstly, good luck with that \u2013 chemistry is king, and you know it. And secondly, your brother\u2019s a dummy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy brother is a genius,\u201d Lena corrects, and Kara just grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not as smart as you, which means he\u2019s a dummy.\u201d</p>\n<p>At Kara\u2019s goofy smile, Lena can\u2019t help but crack one of her own. \u201cSo, everyone less intelligent than me is a dummy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>The word is delivered with complete seriousness, and Lena laughs, shaking her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strange.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not wasting your potential,\u201d Kara fires back, the ever-present, infuriating kindness in her gaze making Lena almost ready to believe her. \u201cThe kids love you! You\u2019re inspiring young girls to like science.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> inspiring them?\u201d Lena scoffs, falling back on her usual tactic when it comes to talking about her feelings \u2013 deflection. \u201cHalf of your classes end the year completely in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think your classes don\u2019t have crushes on <em>you</em>, Miss Perfect Bone Structure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat -?\u201d Lena chokes, but before she can finish the question, they\u2019ve arrived at Cat\u2019s already-open office door. Cat\u2019s voice rings out from inside and Lena straightens, frantically trying to push back all the thoughts that arose inside her traitorous brain with Kara\u2019s unexpected compliment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re finished with your flirty banter, feel free to come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Feeling her face heat up at Cat\u2019s perpetual bluntness, Lena hurries past Kara and takes a seat in one of the chairs in front of Cat\u2019s desk. Kara follows, and Lena isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s a comfort or a curse that Kara looks exactly as red as Lena feels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep this brief, ladies,\u201d Cat says as soon as they\u2019ve settled into their seats. Lena crosses her legs primly, straightening her posture in preparation for whatever Cat has deemed important enough to call a meeting \u2013 in her focus, she entirely misses the way Kara\u2019s eyes follow the movement of her calves.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur school leads the entire state in number of students going into STEM fields, especially girls. I would like to capitalize on that success,\u201d Cat announces matter-of-factly, and Lena blinks owlishly at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we have to do with that?\u201d Lena asks, feeling like she\u2019s missing something.</p>\n<p>Cat rolls her eyes. \u201cWhy do you think we have so many girls going into STEM, Miss Luthor?\u201d she asks, a challenging eyebrow raised. Lena shrugs, offering the easiest explanation.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we have so many science and mathematics classes available?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cat shakes her head, her fingers lacing together in a steeple in front of her face. \u201cYou can throw as many science classes at high school students as you want, but you can\u2019t make them enjoy it. The reason we have such a high concentration of graduates going into science and engineering programs is because of their <em>teachers</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Grant \u2013\u201c Lena starts, but Cat holds up a hand, clearly not finished with her tirade. It takes every scrap of willpower Lena has not to look over at Kara, whose smug, knowing gaze is boring into the side of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have some of the country\u2019s finest teachers at this establishment, Miss Luthor, and you two are among the most universally beloved by our students. For god\u2019s sake, you two chaperone half the clubs in the department.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true \u2013 she and Kara are the teacher chaperones for the science club, the Mathletes, and strangely enough, the chess club. It\u2019s not strange for Lena, of course, as a well-established chess prodigy \u2013 there\u2019s no point being modest, when she swept every competition in the western hemisphere before the age of 16 \u2013 but Kara is notoriously terrible at it. When Lena pokes at her for losing almost every match, even to the rookie players who joined only recently, she just grins and claims that she\u2019s <em>here to learn, Lena.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThis year we\u2019re going to be starting a new pilot program \u2013 a combination class aimed at our incoming 9<sup>th</sup> grade students. An introduction to the sciences that most students find intimidating. You\u2019ll be teaching it,\u201d Cat continues, and finally Kara\u2019s eyes leave Lena\u2019s face, and she seems to clue in on her intent.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, when you say<em> \u2018you\u2019ll be teaching\u2019, </em>you mean\u2026both of us?\u201d Kara asks, sounding more than a little apprehensive. \u201cTogether?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s own apprehension is so high that she\u2019s fairly sure she\u2019s seconds away from hyperventilation, but she\u2019s surprising even herself with how well she\u2019s hiding it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstute observation, Miss Danvers. Yes, you\u2019ll both be teaching it. It\u2019s clear to anyone in the room with you that the two of you work well together. You have\u2026magnetism.\u201d Cat sounds matter-of-fact, but the casual way she states that other people - Both students and teachers - have noticed how she and Kara interact makes Lena want to sink into the floor and disappear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill Alex be involved too?\u201d Kara asks, seeming much less bothered by the observation.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s rare for siblings to teach at the same school, but Lena has always admired the working relationship that Kara and her sister have managed to maintain. She likes Alex \u2013 the older Danvers consistently gloats whenever a student transfers from Lena\u2019s physics to her own biology classes, but there\u2019s always an undercurrent of respect between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that three instructors might be overkill, and biology has no issues with enrollment. No, it\u2019ll be just you two. Kara is perfectly capable of teaching chemistry, and you can handle physics.\u201d Cat\u2019s tone says that there\u2019s very little room for argument, and Lena accepts her fate with a curt nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ve created a base curriculum, but I expect the two of you to fine-tune it together to tailor it to your teaching styles before the school year starts,\u201d Cat says, already handing over two binders. Kara takes hers with interest, immediately flipping through to the Chem section, and Lena tries to figure out how the hell she\u2019s going to survive the semester.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re dismissed not long after, Cat waving them off while already dialing into another phone meeting. Lena is left standing in the hallway with Kara, trying desperately to re-calibrate after the events of the last 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026we\u2019re gonna be pretty close this year, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s voice is like a thunderclap in Lena\u2019s brain. Her head whips around to look at Kara in alarm, and something on her face must <em>scream</em> discomfort because Kara immediately backpedals, holding her hands up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, we\u2019re going to be working together a lot! With the new class, and our classrooms being \u2013 and we\u2019re going to have to plan, and \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Lena snaps out of her daze, waving off the worried explanation and taking a deep, measured breath. \u201cRight. It\u2019s fine, Kara. I know what you meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, do you maybe want to go hang out in my office? To go over lesson plans?\u201d</p>\n<p>What Lena really wants to do is curl up on her couch with a glass of wine \u2013 maybe something stronger \u2013 and watch a mindless documentary until she passes out from sheer emotional exhaustion. But Kara looks so nervous and earnest and <em>attractive</em> with her wide blue eyes and her lip caught between her teeth, and Lena is nothing if not weak.</p>\n<p>She nods, and Kara\u2019s smile is almost enough to make her forget that she shouldn\u2019t be happy about this.</p>\n<p>Kara, for her part, seems to be genuinely excited about this new development. She has Cat\u2019s binder open again, and she has all the confidence that Lena doesn\u2019t feel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is going to be really great!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to be <em>terrible</em>, Alex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara throws her shopping bags into Alex\u2019s backseat, flopping into the passenger seat and buckling up. The car engine revs and Alex, ever the big sister, only laughs at Kara\u2019s anguish as they pull out of the mall parking lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be <em>fine</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow? <em>How</em> is it going to be fine? I have enough trouble not staring at her 24/7 normally. Now I have to watch her teach and somehow keep it together?\u201d Kara lets her head hit the seat, groaning. \u201cShe\u2019s <em>amazing</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex rolls her eyes, but it does nothing to sway Kara\u2019s opinion. Lena Luthor is, without a doubt, the most fascinating person Kara has ever met. She\u2019s thought so since the day they met, when Lena was almost hyperventilating in her new office and Kara happened to be walking by. She had initially just wanted to comfort whoever was having such a bad day, but when she saw that the person in question was possibly the most beautiful woman that\u2019s ever graced the halls of National City Prep\u2026she might have put a little bit of extra effort in.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s only human.</p>\n<p>Little did she know, Lena is also kind and funny and caring and undeniably <em>soft</em> under that aloof shell, and she was basically screwed from day one.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this, like, the best possible outcome? You\u2019ve had a thing for Lena ever since her first day,\u201d Alex says, swatting Kara\u2019s hand away from the cupholder. \u201cHey! <em>My</em> latte. Hands off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara huffs, crossing her arms after her sneaky pilfering is intercepted. \u201cYeah, exactly, Alex. I have a thing for her. I\u2019ve <em>always</em> had a thing for her, but nothing can happen. I thought I\u2019d be fine, but then we started planning lessons and she\u2019s so smart and I now have to spend every day watching her lecture in those dresses and those <em>heels</em> and \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, nothing can happen?\u201d Alex interrupts, frowning and waving a hand. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a coworker!\u201d Kara says, but Alex only scoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? That didn\u2019t stop James and Winn, last year. Or James and Lucy, the year before. Come to think of it, James needs to calm his ass down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara purses her lips. \u201cYeah, but Lena is different. She deserves better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than <em>me,</em>\u201d Kara finally admits, her voice raising slightly. \u201cLena is\u2026she\u2019s a genius. She could change the world, Alex. She\u2019s probably <em>going</em> to. Her brother wants her to go work for LuthorCorp, instead of teaching. And, being with someone like me\u2026I\u2019d just bring her down.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thoughts spill from her mouth like spontaneous word-vomit, thoughts she\u2019s had ever since she snuck into the back of Lena\u2019s third-period Robotics class and watched her in her real element. Robotics is by no means a common elective in high schools but Lena fought hard to be allowed to offer it - and the moment Kara saw the way she captured her students\u2019 interest by flawlessly programming a robotic arm to use ASL, Kara knew that Lena was destined to do amazing things.</p>\n<p>Alex is quiet for a few moments after her outburst, and Kara chews on a thumbnail, staring at the passing trees outside the window.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, Kara. I didn\u2019t know you felt that strongly,\u201d Alex says softly, taking her eyes off the road for a moment to look at Kara in concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kara sighs, rubbing her face. \u201cAnd besides, I don\u2019t even think she likes women. She never talks about dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex snorts, and Kara glances at her sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, kiddo. I just think Lena probably leans towards women more than you think,\u201d Alex says vaguely, and Kara\u2019s eyes narrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cBased on what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIntuition,\u201d Alex answers cryptically, shrugging.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I say I was here to help?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara rolls her eyes, continuing on with her previous train of thought. \u201cWhatever. So, like I said, this year is going to be torture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Alex says finally, patting Kara on the leg sympathetically, \u201cYou said you were thinking about leaving at the end of this year anyways, right? Maybe this is the push you need to finally try out\u00a0journalism.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Kara says quietly, and thankfully Alex takes the cue. The rest of their drive is quiet, and Kara can focus on how the hell she\u2019s going to survive the semester.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their first class together is...an experience.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard, usually, to get a class full of fresh-faced 9<sup>th</sup> graders to care about a mandatory science credit. But with the two of them working together, a rhythmic give-and-take, they don\u2019t provide an opportunity for the students to check out. It\u2019s so much easier to keep everyone engaged with Lena there, being her beautiful and firm self, while Kara can lighten the mood and get their affection.</p>\n<p>A few of the kids are even smiling when they leave, including the blonde girl in the front row who looked like she was about to have a heart attack when the period started. The girl \u2013 Eve, Kara remembers from taking attendance \u2013 spares a last lingering glance at Lena as she slips out the door, and Kara chuckles knowingly.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Another student falls victim to the Luthor effect.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Not that Kara is immune either, in all fairness, she concedes as her eyes are drawn to Lena\u2019s hips in that blue dress.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThat didn\u2019t go so badly, right?\u201d Kara grins, throwing her marker into the air and catching it again. \u201cI think they liked us together.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only 5 minutes between periods, meaning that Kara should probably be going back to her own classroom to prepare for her next class, but as per usual she\u2019s finding it difficult to stop her conversation with the brunette.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, they certainly seemed to find it amusing that your shirt has been mis-buttoned for the last 50 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara looks down, stomach sinking with the dawning realization that Lena is right \u2013 her second button is in the third button-hole, meaning her whole shirt is slightly crooked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t <em>tell me?\u201d </em>Kara groans, looking down at herself despondently. It\u2019s not a huge deal, really \u2013 her shirt is tucked in anyways, so it\u2019s almost not noticeable \u2013 but it is a pain in the ass and she\u2019s already brainstorming on how to get Lena back for the prank.</p>\n<p>Lena snorts, hiding her grin behind her hand. \u201cAnd miss out on seeing your face right now? Absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara sighs, shaking her head playfully in Lena\u2019s direction and pulling her shirt away from her waistband. \u201cYou know what, I am totally going to Cat after this and telling her you\u2019re creating a hostile work environment.\u201d</p>\n<p>She makes sure to actually look down at what her fingers are doing as she quickly unbuttons her shirt and buttons it back up <em>properly </em>this time \u2013 and she only raises her head back up in alarm when she hears a small, choked noise. She looks up to see Lena\u2019s back is now to her, dark hair twirling as she spins on her heel. With alarming gusto, she picks up the eraser on the table and starts to clean the whiteboard with what Kara can only describe as a manic precision.</p>\n<p>Weird.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Kara is finished with her buttoning when the 2-minute bell rings, and the first of Lena\u2019s senior Astronomy students start to file in. Some of them grin and wave, knowing Kara from years previous or from one of the clubs she chaperones, and Kara waves happily back and asks a few about their summer while Lena seems hell-bent on ensuring there isn\u2019t a single speck of marker left on the board.</p>\n<p>Finally the period bell rings, and right on time a student pokes their head through the conjoining door from Kara\u2019s classroom. When she sees Kara leaning against the lab table and Lena finally turning back around with slightly reddened cheeks, she grins in a way that Kara notices is just <em>slightly</em> too knowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s 2:30, Miss Danvers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shoot!\u201d Kara exclaims, straightening up. She tosses the marker to Lena, who barely catches it - the plastic bounces between her shaky hands until she finally pins it to her abdomen.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta go! Geology don\u2019t teach itself.\u201d Kara jogs over to the adjoining door, turning around and shooting finger guns at Lena with a wink as she backs through it. \u201cSee ya tomorrow, partner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s students titter, and a few of the familiar mathletes sitting in the back noticeably lean over to each other and start to whisper. Lena, seeming to have recovered from her frantic board-cleaning, shakes her head at the cheesy joke. She claps her hands, and immediately a hush falls on the class. The door stays open just long enough for Kara to hear her put on her teacher-voice \u2013 the one that never fails to make shivers run up Kara\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, everyone, settle down. Today we\u2019re doing an intro to celestial mechanics, and trust me \u2013 it is going to need <em>all</em> of your attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door swings closed after that, muffling Lena\u2019s stern voice, and Kara rubs her hands together, trying to shove the brunette out of her mind \u2013 at least, for long enough to teach her last class of the day.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Who wants to learn about rocks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three weeks into her shared teaching experience, Lena is managing better than she thought she would.</p>\n<p>Cat was right in her assessment, it seems \u2013 she and Kara do work well together, their banter and slightly different teaching styles seeming to keep the freshmen more engaged than they would be normally. The combination of Lena\u2019s high standards and no-nonsense attitude with Kara\u2019s goofy charm and daily chemistry puns (today, the board reads \u2018<em>think like a pro-ton: always stay positive!\u2019</em>) seems to be a hit.</p>\n<p>The class has abnormally high grades so far, and 4 students have even successfully joined the mathletes, a club that\u2019s usually known for being notoriously difficult for 9<sup>th</sup> graders to handle. And, with the exception of what she\u2019s pretty sure was a minor heart attack when Kara <em>unbuttoned her goddamn shirt</em> in the middle of their classroom on day one, the instances of her making an idiot of herself over her attraction to the younger Danvers have been less and less common.</p>\n<p>Of the many differences between their teaching styles, one thing they seem to have thankfully found common ground on is a love for hands-on experimentation as a learning tool. Kara is known for her often-dangerous but always entertaining chemistry labs, and Lena loves any project that can show students the actual real-world applications of physics. It helps them visualize what all the theory can actually be used for, and often they stay more engaged with the content afterwards. Kara has even recently been finding and emailing new physics experiments to Lena, with excited commentary on how they could work them into the curriculum \u2013 and in return, Lena has been playing Safety Officer for Kara\u2019s chemistry labs, moving paper away from Bunsen burners and reminding Kara when she has and has <em>not</em> rolled up her sleeves.</p>\n<p>Lena really should have known that eventually, with Kara in the room, one of their experiments was bound to go awry.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena, stay there! I\u2019m gonna record it!\u201d Kara yells, already sprinting across the field with her phone in her hand. Lena chuckles at her enthusiasm and stays where she is, next to the impressively-sized bottle-rocket the class has managed to construct to demonstrate Newton\u2019s third law of motion. If all goes well, the pressure of the air being pumped into the half-full bottle should propel it into the sky, and the students have a bet going with Kara about how far it will go. She\u2019s not sure what the ultimate prize is, but there\u2019s a jar of calculations (and, she knows, a few guesses) on her desk just waiting to be sorted through.</p>\n<p>Just as Lena hoped, the class seem buzzed about being outside \u2013 they drew names to see who would get to pump the rocket, and the student in question is practically vibrating with excitement. A few students are kneeled next to the thing, still decorating it \u2013 \u201cKARLENA 1\u201d is written in bubble letters on the side, surrounded by a rainbow of star-shaped stickers. Lena had resisted the title, the first-name portmanteau hitting a little too close to home, but the students had been so insistent that she eventually caved.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, ready!\u201d Kara\u2019s distant voice calls \u2013 she\u2019s squatting on the grass, her camera angled towards the sky to get the best view of the rocket going up. Shooting her a thumbs-up, Lena turns to Ruby and smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Danvers is ready, so it looks like it\u2019s time to launch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nodding vigorously, Ruby grabs the pump handle and starts to work it. Just as Lena explained in class yesterday, it gets harder and harder to move it as more air fills the small space.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you guys can see, it\u2019s getting more difficult for Ruby to pump. Why is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ruby continues in her struggle, and another keen student \u2013 Ruby\u2019s friend Eve Tessmacher, Lena remembers \u2013 raises her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s reaching absolute pressure?\u201d Eve says, slightly timid, and Lena nods in approval.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly \u2013 fantastic, Eve,\u201d Lena says warmly, and Eve\u2019s cheeks go pink at the praise. A slight hissing is coming from the bottle now, and Lena knows it\u2019s only a matter of seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, everyone, pay attention \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Before she can finish, the rocket flies into the air with a loud <em>pop, </em>and the class erupts into a wall of noise. Trailing water in its wake, it arcs over the soccer field and starts to spin, finally starting its descent about halfway between the crowd of students and Kara.</p>\n<p><em>She picked a pretty good spot</em>, Lena thinks absently as the rocket gets closer and closer to Kara and the students yell in excitement.</p>\n<p><em>She should probably move</em>, Lena notes with growing concern as the rocket plummets. It\u2019s falling at an alarming pace now, and Kara doesn\u2019t seem to be moving \u2013 she\u2019s looking at her phone screen, grinning as it flies towards her \u2013</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, fuck.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Just as Lena realizes what\u2019s about to happen, there\u2019s a sickening crack as the carefully-crafted experiment collides with Kara\u2019s face, and she hits the ground with a thud.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cKara!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Lena is running before Kara even hits the ground, all sense of propriety forgotten as she sprints across the grass in heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, fuck, <em>Kara</em>, are you okay \u2013\u201c Kara\u2019s glasses lie broken on the dirt beside her, and Lena scoops a hand under her neck to lift her into a sitting position.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrap, crap, <em>crap</em> \u2013\u201c Kara mutters thickly. She slowly sits up with Lena\u2019s help, a hand held over her face, and a wave of nausea rolls through Lena when the hand comes away covered in blood. Kara\u2019s whole face is stained with it from the nose down, and her eyes are hazy and unfocused, staring somewhere in the vicinity of Lena\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara? Kara, look at me.\u201d But Kara\u2019s gaze stays where it is, and Lena snaps her fingers, panic rising in her gut. \u201cHey, hey! <em>Kara</em>! Look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, Kara\u2019s eyes slide up to Lena\u2019s, and Lena carefully holds three fingers in front of her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d</p>\n<p>There are a few moments of silence, and then Kara grins, the blood making it look slightly macabre.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d she says dazedly, and Lena is fairly sure that her entire body blushes as the students start to gather around them, breathing heavily.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus <em>Christ</em>, Kara\u2026\u201d she mutters, feeling uncomfortably hot, and thankfully the kids are mostly talking amongst themselves rather than listening to Kara\u2019s probably-concussed rambling.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly <em>crap</em>, that\u2019s a lot of blood \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see Miss Luthor run? I <em>told</em> you guys \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think her nose is broken?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s eyes go unfocused again, a cute little frown on her face, and it\u2019s all just a little bit too much with Kara still bleeding and a large bruise forming on her cheekbone. Feeling overwhelmed, Lena snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone, go back to class and wait there until the period is over. I\u2019m taking Miss Danvers to the nurse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her tone brokers no argument, and slowly the students start to file back towards the school building. When she\u2019s sure the attention is off the two of them, she puts a steadying arm under Kara\u2019s and lets her weight fall on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d Lena murmurs, and Kara nods enthusiastically. Together they stand, taking a large, hopeful step forward \u2013</p>\n<p>And then Kara pitches sideways, almost landing face-first in the dirt.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shit</em>,\u201d Lena mutters under her breath, trying desperately to pull Kara back up. \u201cYou know I appreciate your muscles, but why do you have to be so damn <em>heavy</em> \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need help, Miss Luthor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eve Tessmacher is standing nearby, looking nervous but earnest, and Lena sighs in defeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Together they manage to haul Kara back up, and the three of them make their slow, tottering way back to the school building behind the rest of the class.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Miss Danvers going to be okay?\u201d Eve asks. She sounds anxious, and Lena hurries to reassure her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine. I think it\u2019s just a concussion. And\u2026maybe a broken nose,\u201d she admits, still rueing the day she agreed to do this experiment. Bottle rockets, with Kara Danvers? Of course someone got hurt. And of <em>course</em>, it was Kara.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seemed really worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena swallows hard, trying not to flinch at the observation. She made a scene earlier, running to Kara like that, and she\u2019s honestly a little bit glad that Kara is too concussed to remember it. \u201cI\u2019d be worried if any of you got hit with a bottle rocket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eve says, but she doesn\u2019t sound convinced. It doesn\u2019t help that Kara chooses that exact moment to stand perfectly upright, practically wrenching Lena\u2019s shoulder as she does.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, Jesus \u2013\u201c Lena hisses, and Kara looks down at her with a look of awe on her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Kara?\u201d Lena answers cautiously, hovering close just in case Kara falls over again.</p>\n<p>Kara blinks down at her owlishly, still covered in drying blood. \u201cI got hit in the face with a rocket!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s face breaks out into a grin, and she throws a fist in the air. \u201cThat was totally <em>awesome</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>At Kara\u2019s shout, the students still scattered across the field start looking back at their little huddled group. Laughing at Kara\u2019s still-raised fist, some of them yell back.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <em>was</em> awesome, Miss Danvers!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage, Miss Arias!\u201d Lena scolds, and in the distance Ruby winces, looking abashed.</p>\n<p>But Kara is far past caring about language \u2013 her hand is still in the air, and she calls back to them. \u201cYeah! LONG LIVE KARLENA ONE!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena is slightly alarmed at how delighted their class looks by that sentence.</p>\n<p>Shaking it off, Lena slings Kara\u2019s arm over hers again. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you looked at.\u201d</p>\n<p>She thanks whatever deity is listening that Kara goes quiet after that, letting Lena and Eve carry her to the nurse\u2019s office unimpeded. Eve takes her leave once Kara is settled on the little cot, and Lena perches stiffly on the wooden chair beside the bed while the nurse pages for Alex.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d Kara asks in a small voice, and Lena nods, crossing her legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cUntil your sister comes to get you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara smiles absently, her head lolling from one side to the other. \u201cAm I going home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re going to the hospital,\u201d Lena replies, and Kara frowns, a sweet little crinkle forming between her brows that Lena wants to smooth away with her thumb. Her hand twitching with the urge, but she clenches it into a fist. Even if Kara isn\u2019t going to remember it, she refuses to humiliate herself for the second time today.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t you come with me?\u201d Kara asks, and Lena has to bite at the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling at the way Kara is looking at her with wide, trusting eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go teach my last class,\u201d she says softly, and Kara\u2019s resulting pout is almost cute enough for Lena to forgive her for getting hit in the face to begin with.</p>\n<p>She gets a few moments to compose herself when the nurse bustles back in, a bowl of soapy water in hand. While she cleans Kara\u2019s bloody face and checks her fairly obvious concussion symptoms, Lena glances at the doorway. <em>Where the hell is Alex? </em></p>\n<p>Clearly, she\u2019s going to have to keep Kara occupied for a little bit longer. Unfortunately the task gets all that much harder when the nurse leaves again, leaving Kara with her hair down, her glasses off, and staring directly at Lena with an unnervingly focused gaze.</p>\n<p>Her eyes are piercing, and her skin is just a little bit red from the wet cloth, and <em>oh my god, she looks so cute. </em><em>Why does she look so cute concussed?</em></p>\n<p>Finally, after at least a full minute of uninterrupted staring that Lena does her best to ignore, she sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>, Kara?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara smiles, looking more coherent than she has since the rocket made contact with her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust glad you\u2019re here. You\u2019re so smart. And you\u2019re so\u2026floaty. And\u2026<em>beautiful</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s stomach drops in a way she can\u2019t completely convince herself is unpleasant. <em>Beautiful. She thinks I\u2019m \u2013</em></p>\n<p>Lena nearly jumps out of her skin when the door opens, and Alex Danvers charges through it like she\u2019s on a mission.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, what the <em>hell</em> did you do now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taking the opportunity she\u2019s being offered, Lena stands abruptly, excusing herself and letting Kara\u2019s sister grill her on the circumstances of her injury. She slips out the door unnoticed, drying her sweaty palms on her skirt while she power-walks down the empty hallway.</p>\n<p>So much for things going well so far.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy head hurts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara moves the ice pack to the other side of her forehead, squinting at the too-bright sunlight coming through the window. Behind her Alex opens and closes a cupboard, and the noise of it makes her flinch.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would hurt less if you went and had a nap in your nice, dark bedroom like I told you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s lonely in there,\u201d Kara complains, and Alex sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d take care of you, but I did not sign up for an endless pit of whining. Go to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara pouts silently, her eyes now closed against the light. She hears Alex pour herself a drink and sit on the other part of the sectional near her feet, and the rustle of a book opening. But there are thoughts that have been swirling in her scrambled brain all day, and before Alex has even turned to a new page, Kara has opened her mouth again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think Lena will call?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex huffs, pointedly putting the book and her mug down. Kara, fully aware of how pathetic her voice sounds, squeezes her eyes shut again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would Lena call you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kara grumbles, turning onto her side and hugging a nearby decorative pillow. \u201cTo see if I\u2019m okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes she even have your number?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course she has my number. We teach a class together,\u201d Kara says grumpily.</p>\n<p>\u201cHas she called you before?\u201d Alex asks, and Kara hates how logical her arguments are. She knows that Lena has no real reason to call her. But that doesn\u2019t stop her from looking hopefully at her phone every few minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026no. But she could text.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKara\u2026\u201d Alex\u2019s voice has a thread of pity in it, and Kara groans, pulling the pillow over her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I <em>know</em>. Just let me wallow, okay? I\u2019m concussed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex pats her ankle consolingly, and while she picks her book up again Kara closes her eyes and tries to sleep. But her mind continues on, running in circles around the same few thoughts she\u2019s been obsessing over since she came to on the grass of the soccer field covered in blood.</p>\n<p>She had been dazed, certainly, and there are gaps in her memory \u2013 for example, she doesn\u2019t remember most of the walk from the field to the nurses\u2019 office \u2013 but she wasn\u2019t completely incognisant that day. She remembers hearing Lena\u2019s voice scream her name, and the warmth of her presence at her side. She remembers the tenderness with which Lena touched her forehead, the way she blushed at Kara\u2019s (stupid, <em>inappropriate</em>, god, she needs to apologize for that somehow) joke.</p>\n<p>She remembers Lena admitting that she appreciates her muscles.</p>\n<p>Flexing absently, Kara makes a plan to kick up her gym time once her headache goes away. Which, based on how difficult sleep is turning out to be, probably won\u2019t be for a while.</p>\n<p>Huffing dramatically, Kara turns over again and stares at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cDistract me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Alex doesn\u2019t even look up at her this time, instead taking a long sip of the steaming mug she\u2019s been letting cool. She\u2019s clearly trying to ignore her. Smiling deviously, Kara puts on a practiced tone of nonchalance when she answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, how about you tell me all about that cute PTA mom you were flirting with on Tuesday?\u201d</p>\n<p>Exactly as Kara hoped, Alex chokes on her drink, spraying some of it across the coffee table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2013 <em>flirting</em> \u2013\u201c Alex coughs, her face red from more than just the hot water that\u2019s now dribbling out of her nose. \u201cShe just \u2013 her daughter is in my freshman class, and she wants to be a parent chaperone for our class trips. That\u2019s all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm. Okay. Tell that to your face,\u201d Kara says, disbelief in every inch of her voice. Alex flicks spilled tea at her, and she flinches at the droplets. \u201cHey! I\u2019m <em>concussed</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was <em>not</em> flirting,\u201d Alex maintains, but Kara knows her sister, and she knows what she saw. She tuned in only at the end of Alex\u2019s conversation with Ruby Arias\u2019 mother when she met Alex to get a ride home, but judging by the dreamy way Alex waved goodbye, there was more than a little flirting happening before she got there.</p>\n<p>And, not that it means anything, but she doesn\u2019t recall seeing a ring on Ms. Arias\u2019 finger.</p>\n<p>Her face must betray her thoughts, because Alex smacks Kara\u2019s calf with her book, pointing a threatening finger. \u201cHey, I could just leave you here alone. Unlike you right now, I\u2019m allowed to operate a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara groans, poking at her with a socked foot. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would. Don\u2019t test me. Now, go to <em>sleep</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally she does, lulled by the soft noises of turning pages and Alex\u2019s always-comforting presence \u2013 but her dreams are filled with bottle rockets and concerned green eyes, soft hands touching her cheek and her name, shouted in a familiar voice.</p>\n<p>It takes a few days for her headache to really ease, but thankfully by Monday she\u2019s feeling well enough to go back to work again. And just in time, too \u2013 parent-teacher conference night is something she\u2019d prefer not to miss, even with a huge purple bruise across her cheekbone.</p>\n<p>Her students seem happy to see her. According to her Chem 3 students, the substitute teacher Ms. Smythe had been \u2018boring and mean\u2019 \u2013 but no class seems happier than her freshman Integrated Sciences class with Lena. Cat hadn\u2019t bothered to get a sub for her, instead letting Lena take the lead for the few days she was off, so it doesn\u2019t make much sense that they missed her the most; but she comes back to 21 ecstatic students, a cake with a crashed rocket on it, and Lena looking quietly relieved at her presence.</p>\n<p>Even though the cake is her favourite flavour (how they know she loves chocolate cake with raspberry buttercream she has no idea. Maybe they asked Alex), Lena\u2019s smile when she walks through their adjoining door is still the best part of her day.</p>\n<p>At least, it is until the conferences later on.</p>\n<p>Of course, her interviews go well \u2013 she doesn\u2019t really have any problem students, and all the parents she meets seem perfectly nice. And slightly later, when she and Lena are doing joint interviews for their shared class, it\u2019s great to hear the positive feedback that the freshmen\u2019s parents have for them, about how their teaching has made their kids interested in science for the first time.</p>\n<p>But the best part of it isn\u2019t seeing her students or meeting their parents or the praise \u2013 it\u2019s the way that Lena touches her arm as the night is winding down, how she leads her into a quiet hallway off the gymnasium where all the little stations are set up and raises a gentle hand to the bruise on her cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks worse than it feels,\u201d Kara jokes quietly, and Lena smiles softly, her fingers trailing over the warm skin. Instinctively Kara moves her face towards them, and as if she\u2019s only just realized exactly what she\u2019s doing, Lena pulls her hand away quickly, clenching it at her side.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks pretty bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara shrugs, leaning against the wall on her left. \u201cThe worst of it was when I was still all bloody. Thankfully, my nose didn\u2019t break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still feel a little guilty that it was my experiment that got you hurt,\u201d Lena admits, and Kara shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault I was looking at my phone and not the object hurtling towards my face,\u201d she deadpans, and Lena chuckles, moving closer and leaning as well. She ducks her head, a curtain of black hair obscuring part of her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought about calling you. To see how you were feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s heart leaps into her throat.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Vindication! Take that, Alex -</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d is what she says instead, in a much more measured tone. Lena looks back up, and suddenly she realizes exactly how close they\u2019re standing \u2013 their chests are almost touching, and she\u2019s close enough that she can smell Lena\u2019s perfume, something light and floral and probably expensive. Lena\u2019s eyes are wide and so, <em>so</em> green, and when she exhales shakily Kara can feel the warm breath wash over her skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201c Lena whispers, her eyes flickering down \u2013</p>\n<p>One of the gym doors opens with a slam, several couples and a few kids spilling out and heading towards the doors to the parking lot down the hall, and Lena jumps back as if she\u2019s been electrocuted. Tucking her hair behind her ear with a shaky smile, she side-steps around Kara and heads towards the now-open door, heels clicking rapidly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena \u2013\u201c Kara calls, frowning at the interruption, but Lena slips through the crowd and back into the gym easily, and Kara is left standing alone in the hallway.</p>\n<p>The moment stays with her for the rest of the night, even though Lena seems determined to avoid her afterwards. It preoccupies her through the rest of her parent meetings, and it\u2019s distracting enough that she doesn\u2019t even gather the energy to tease Alex about the fact that she\u2019s spent 45 minutes leaning against her table and clearly flirting with Ruby\u2019s mom.</p>\n<p>She does, however, give an encouraging smile and a thumbs-up to Ruby herself, who is standing nearby with a mischievous look of dawning realization on her face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The early October breezes are carrying a chill now, crisp leaves skittering across the pavement under her feet when Lena makes the quick walk from her car. She gathers her coat around herself, shivering absently as the wind picks up, and behind her she hears what she\u2019s been hearing almost every morning since September \u2013 Kara\u2019s shoes hitting the pavement at a quick jog until she gets to Lena\u2019s side, her sunny smile making Lena\u2019s day a tiny bit brighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Lena!\u201d</p>\n<p>As usual, Lena lets Kara grab the door and hold it open for her, and at this point she can almost pinpoint the exact moment when Kara will say -</p>\n<p>\u201cLadies first!\u201d</p>\n<p>Smiling to herself, Lena steps through the door like she always does, and Kara falls into step behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Kara,\u201d she says finally, and Kara grins, her long legs catching up to Lena\u2019s pace.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your day so far?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena takes a sip from her travel mug, the hot coffee brightening her day even more. \u201cIt\u2019s barely started, but so far, it\u2019s acceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p>When they reach the science hallway Kara follows her into her classroom and sets her leather messenger bag on the floor, another frequent feature of Lena\u2019s morning, and Lena sets her coffee down on the lab table before shucking out of her jacket, hanging it on the hook near her office door.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena!\u201d Kara sounds surprised, and Lena turns around, expecting something out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara takes her own coat off, laying it on the desk, and reveals the outfit underneath. She\u2019s wearing \u2013</p>\n<p>Jeans. <em>Tight</em> jeans.</p>\n<p>Tight skinny jeans, a comfortable-looking long sleeved shirt, and sneakers. She looks slightly ruffled and soft and <em>oh, god</em>. She should have remembered.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Casual Day! Did you forget?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena turns around and heads to her office, needing a few moments to not be looking at Kara Danvers in <em>jeans</em>. Unfortunately Kara follows her, and her respite is short-lived. Kara perches on the edge of her desk, and Lena is forced to continue the conversation as if she isn\u2019t completely overwhelmed by the miles and <em>miles</em> of fitted denim in her field of vision.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m already wearing <em>pants</em>, Kara,\u201d she says, gesturing to her tailored dress pants and silk shirt and trying for levity. Kara looks downright scandalized.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing \u2013 is that <em>casual</em> for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not, of course. Lena enjoys comfortable clothes as much as the next person \u2013 she has sweatpants and tank tops at home, flannels and soft shirts \u2013 but the thought of wearing them to work makes her feel uncomfortably exposed. Her clothes are a part of her armour, her usual pencil skirts and blouses and heels giving her a sense of control over her day, and wearing pants \u2013 even tailored dress pants \u2013 actually is a bit outside of her usual comfort zone. She smooths the pressed fabric with a clammy hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s casual enough,\u201d Lena insists, but Kara shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt truly isn\u2019t,\u201d Kara says firmly, and she disappears towards her own classroom. Lena takes a deep breath, trying to organize her thoughts, but before she can even begin Kara is coming back with a bundle in her hand. It\u2019s gray, and soft-looking, and she shoves it into Lena\u2019s hands with an expectant look. \u201cHere.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bundle droops when Kara grabs it, the fabric unfurling and almost touching the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sweater, genius,\u201d Kara grins, and Lena holds it out in front of her, looking it over. In blue print it reads \u201cNational City University\u201d with a school crest.</p>\n<p>Kara wants her to wear her school sweater.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lena drawls, thankful that she sounds much more casual than she feels, \u201cWhat are you expecting me to <em>do</em> with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s casual day, Lena!\u201d Kara is already leaving, the door swinging shut behind her as the bustle of students entering the school starts to infiltrate the room. Lena brings the sweater up to her face, inhaling deeply \u2013 it smells like clean detergent and something else, something she recognizes but can\u2019t place. A Kara-smell \u2013 probably what Kara\u2019s apartment smells like. The thought makes her stomach swoop.</p>\n<p>Against her better judgement, Lena puts it on.</p>\n<p>Of course, the difference is noted immediately. As her Junior Physics 2 students file in, all dressed in their own casual clothes, someone makes the astute observation that her clothes are out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p>\u201cNCU? Didn\u2019t you go to MIT, Miss Luthor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s two framed degrees on the wall behind her desk confirm the statement, so she nods, artfully deflecting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did, yes. Apparently Miss Danvers thought my \u2018casual Friday\u2019 wasn\u2019t going hard enough.\u201d The droll comment garners a laugh from the class, and with the comment squared away, Lena gets started on her planned lesson in Kinematics.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s halfway through explaining non-uniform motion when there\u2019s a swell of loud laughter from next door. Her students are jarred from their own note-taking by the sound, and Lena sighs, knowing what\u2019s coming next.</p>\n<p>As if on cue, the door between their classes opens and Kara strolls in, her entire left sleeve missing to the elbow and smoking slightly at the edges. Kara herself seems alarmingly calm, smiling and waving at some of the familiar students.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, Jesus -</em>\n</p>\n<p>Immediately Lena rushes towards her, rolling the sleeve up to Kara\u2019s bicep and checking the skin of her forearm for damage. Shockingly, she seems fine, except for a few small red patches where the arm hair has been burnt off.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, what on <em>earth</em> \u2013\u201c she says, almost disbelieving that Kara could manage burning her entire sleeve with so little damage to her skin. Kara waves her off, her singed sleeve sliding\u00a0 back down her arm with the movement.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine! We were working on lab safety and combustion today, and \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p><em>\u201cLab safety?\u201d</em> Lena says incredulously, a brow neatly arched, looking pointedly at Kara\u2019s still-smoking shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Kara says, as if Lena is the one not making sense. \u201cAnd clearly, the students have now seen what <em>not</em> to do, so mission accomplished, right guys?\u201d Kara addresses Lena\u2019s class, winking, and they giggle as Lena rolls her eyes. If she weren\u2019t so preoccupied with checking Kara for burns, she might have noticed the way some of them exchange knowing looks, whispering and grinning.</p>\n<p>Kara, for her part, seems unperturbed by the whole situation. She rolls her half-sleeve back down when Lena has satisfied herself that there\u2019s no serious injuries, and she starts hunting around behind Lena\u2019s bench.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways, Lena, did I leave my blazer in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Inwardly, as Kara jokes about her clumsiness and digs through Lena\u2019s cupboards, Lena curses the day her traitorous brain decided to latch onto Kara Danvers.</p>\n<p>When Halloween rolls around at National City Prep, Lena can usually be counted upon to be the only teacher not in the spooky holiday spirit.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s never liked Halloween \u2013 the pressure to wear tacky costumes and go to parties and eat candy never called to her \u2013 so she usually only allows the most basic decoration in her classroom, and she certainly never dresses up.</p>\n<p>This year, with Kara \u2018spirit day\u2019 Danvers involved, she should have known that things would change. Now, instead of going home promptly at 3:15, she\u2019s helping James\u2019 art club hang orange and black streamers and pumpkin decals all over the school.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena, how many times \u2013 ask someone to stabilize your ladder! You could fall!\u201d Kara says frustratedly, dropping her own armful of decorations to rush over and grab the base of Lena\u2019s ladder. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the students to do stuff safely if you\u2019re running up and down like crazy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to get this <em>done</em>, Kara,\u201d Lena says pointedly, putting another piece of tape on the black cat cut-out she\u2019s holding and slapping it haphazardly onto the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s 4:30.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dCome on! This is for the students!\u201d Kara says, winking and handing Lena another decal. With one foot on the base of Lena\u2019s ladder and an arm flexing as she reaches up with a handful of decorations, Kara looks unfairly attractive, and Lena is suddenly grateful for the stabilization because she feels a little bit dizzy.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, are you finally going to dress up this year?\u201d Kara asks, while Lena busies herself adding tape to a line of streamers. \u201cYou could be\u2026I don\u2019t know, Oscar the Grouch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lena protests, throwing a ball of ripped streamer in Kara\u2019s direction and scowling. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>grouchy</em>, I\u2019m just \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cGrouchy,\u201d Kara deadpans, and Lena has to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrown-up,\u201d she counters, and Kara scoffs, waving her off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can be grown up and still love holidays!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena just shakes her head, hanging a paper witch riding a broom from the drop ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I am dressing up this year,\u201d Lena hints, grinning when Kara\u2019s eyes widen in excitement.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? What\u2019s your costume?\u201d Kara asks as Lena finally descends the ladder, deeming her patch of wall adequately decorated.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara groans as Lena dismounts, dusting off her hands. \u201cOh, come on, Lena!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out on Thursday,\u201d Lena says, and to her intense relief, just a moment later James announces that everyone can go home.</p>\n<p>Usually, Lena avoids dressing up. She\u2019s more the type to slap something on last-minute, something low-effort and easily taken off. But this year, she really has found the perfect thing.</p>\n<p>When Thursday finally dawns, she straightens her glasses as she looks over herself in the mirror, adjusting the strap of her leather messenger bag and smiling with satisfaction. Her hair is half-up and curled, she\u2019s wearing men\u2019s shoes with chinos and a tweed blazer, and the nametag sticker on her chest reads \u201cThe Younger\u201d.</p>\n<p>Their students are going to eat it up, and Lena can\u2019t wait to see the look on Kara\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>The hallways are full of vibrant costumes when Lena arrives, so much so that nobody seems to notice her understated one. In fact, nobody seems to recognize her. Even students she\u2019s taught for years barely give her a second glance, and when she gets to her office she looks down at her own outfit with a grin.</p>\n<p>Go big or go home, right?</p>\n<p>She and Kara had promised a Halloween-themed class for today, and she gets to work on setting up all the components of their little experiments while the students start to filter in. Just as she suspected, they love her costume. Most of them compliment her on it, laughing at the various elements and at Lena\u2019s brief Kara impression \u2013 leaning back against the desk and throwing a marker in the air before pointing it at the front row and drawling <em>\u2018I make bad chemistry puns, but only\u2026periodically.\u2019</em></p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Danvers is gonna flip!\u201d Ruby giggles, elbowing Eve and pointing at Lena\u2019s outfit. Eve just blushes crimson, staring resolutely down at her desk.</p>\n<p>Lena is actually starting to get a little bit concerned about where Kara could be when she finally bursts in the door, throwing her bag onto the lab table.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, everyone. This skirt is a real pain, I <em>hate</em> it, I don\u2019t know how some of you guys wear it all day \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Lena looks up from writing the day\u2019s experiments on the whiteboard at the sound of Kara\u2019s voice, and if she\u2019d still been holding her coffee mug, it would likely be in several pieces on the floor by now.</p>\n<p>Kara is, inexplicably, wearing a school uniform.</p>\n<p>White shirt, knee socks, tartan skirt, the whole nine yards \u2013 upon being faced with the section of bare skin between Kara\u2019s mid-shin and lower thigh Lena\u2019s brain does a hard reboot, and the few seconds that it takes to shove it back into the recesses of her mind where it belongs she struggles to form any kind of reaction that isn\u2019t nonverbal questioning noises.</p>\n<p>Kara looks distinctly out of place in the outfit, the skirt not suiting her at all, and she's still wearing her Oxford shoes; but it still takes Lena a solid few moments to recalibrate. Kara is wearing it as a joke, the girlish clothes as much a costume to her as Alex\u2019s polyester hot dog outfit, and the sight of it on anyone else probably wouldn\u2019t phase Lena at all. But the fact remains that Lena has never seen this much of Kara\u2019s revealed skin before. And she\u2019s never going to be able to <em>unsee</em> it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thankfully Kara is distracted for a few moments by the class\u2019 reaction to her costume, and Lena takes a shaky sip of water and collects herself as much as she can.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena!\u201d Kara says finally, looking her up and down and laughing with delight. \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re <em>me</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena tries to school the shakiness out of her voice when she replies. \u201cI figured the best way to get into the spirit of Halloween was to dress up as the holiday\u2019s biggest supporter, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>amazing</em>! Where did you get the glasses?\u201d Kara asks, her eyes glued to the accessory on Lena\u2019s face. Lena touches the thick frames self-consciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re mine, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara blinks slowly. \u201cYou\u2026wear glasses?\u201d Her voice sounds a little faraway, somewhat dreamy, and Lena\u2019s stomach swoops at the sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cUsually I wear contacts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara nods absently, still staring, and Lena feels a tiny glow of pride.</p>\n<p>Maybe she should wear them more often.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s then that they both seem to remember their audience \u2013 24 9<sup>th</sup> grade students, all watching them with rapt attention. Kara clears her throat, blushing slightly and grabbing a marker, throwing it up and catching it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you know who made huge strides in the field of Halloween-related science? Frank-<em>Einstein</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>The entire class erupts into laughter that the joke definitely didn\u2019t warrant and Lena joins them, impressed at how spot-on her impression turned out to be.</p>\n<p>Lena tries to teach the class without being distracted by Kara\u2019s legs. She really does. There\u2019s no reason for her to be all worked up by a glimpse of knee and ankle like some sort of Victorian pearl-clutcher. But she\u2019s genuinely never seen Kara in anything but pants before, and the change is strange and distracting. Every few minutes Kara walks by to help someone with their experiment, and all Lena can see is <em>skin</em>. It\u2019s absolutely maddening, and she\u2019s never felt more relieved for their joint class to be over as she is when Kara finally goes back to her own room.</p>\n<p>By lunchtime Kara has changed into uniform pants, claiming that \u2018<em>the joke isn\u2019t worth wearing a dumb skirt all day\u2019</em>, and it\u2019s annoyingly even <em>more</em> attractive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By mid-November, Kara is starting to get used to the rhythm of working with Lena and shoving her attraction into the back of her mind.</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll admit, there was a blip around Halloween. Seeing Lena in her clothes threw her for a loop, and the image of it is still burned into her mind, resurfacing at inopportune times. Especially the glasses, which Lena has now taken to wearing more often.</p>\n<p>But she has it under <em>control</em>, and her friendship with Lena persists.</p>\n<p>Their success in shared teaching also persists, due in part to Kara suggesting bi-weekly work nights where they brainstorm and plan the next few weeks of lessons and experiments. One of these now-routine sessions ends up falling on the final day before the Thanksgiving weekend - but this time, Lena offers to let her leave after only an hour and a half.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave? We\u2019ve only figured out my half! We still have to do yours,\u201d Kara argues, but Lena brushes her off.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Kara, you can go home. I\u2019m going to be doing absolutely nothing this weekend, so I can work on it by myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara frowns. \u201cNothing? Don\u2019t you spend time with family on Thanksgiving?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have dinner with my mother and brother,\u201d Lena says vaguely, waving a hand. \u201cBut that\u2019s only a few hours on Saturday, and I try to get out of there as fast as I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blas\u00e9 way that she shrugs off what seems like a deep-seated hurt tugs at Kara\u2019s heart. She leans back in her chair, fully intending on not leaving until Lena does.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you not get along with your mom and brother?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena shrugs. \u201cLex and I used to get along, until he became a puppet for my mother. And Lillian\u2026Lillian has never approved of my choices.\u201d The way Lena says it hints at more, and Kara presses on gently, sensing an opportunity to learn a little more about the enigma that is Lena Luthor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lena sighs, rubbing her eyes. She looks tired, suddenly, and a little bit resigned. \u201cFor example\u2026when I was a child, I wanted to work for NASA. I even had a little \u2018women of NASA\u2019 book, which of course my mother threw out as soon as I went to boarding school. When I was 7, it was my dream. But my parents thought that it wasn\u2019t good enough for me. That I would be wasting my potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara gapes at her, trying not to lose her shit entirely as she processes what Lena said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey thought that\u2026<em>NASA</em>\u2026was <em>wasting your potential</em>?\u201d Kara finally says, the sentence not seeming real even as it leaves her mouth.</p>\n<p>Lena smiles tiredly. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the idea of technological innovation and advancement being in the hands of the government.\u201d</p>\n<p>Understanding dawns, and Kara feels the slight irritation she\u2019s always felt towards LuthorCorp grow even deeper in reaction to Lena\u2019s pain. \u201cSo, they wanted you to be making leaps and bounds in science\u2026but only for <em>their</em> company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore or less. You should hear what my mother tells me every Thanksgiving now that I\u2019m a teacher. Talk about wasting potential,\u201d Lena sighs, taking a sip of tea. \u201cThanksgiving in our house has always been a quiet table catered by the Luthor kitchen staff, where my mother points out every wonderful thing Lex has done this year, and how terrible I look by comparison.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena looks sad, like something heavy sits on her shoulders, and Kara feels suddenly guilty for dragging the subject out into the light. She tries for levity, hoping that a joke will lighten her mood.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, any occasion where pie is served can\u2019t be completely awful, right?\u201d Kara says, and Lena shrugs noncommittally.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t do desserts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Imagining Lena, sitting in some huge, cold dining room and being unfairly criticized by her family with <em>no pie in sight</em>, is almost more than Kara can stand. They part that night an hour later, when Lena absolutely insists that Kara go prepare for Eliza and Alex to come over tomorrow, but Kara is plagued the whole way home.</p>\n<p>All through her own family weekend she can\u2019t stop thinking about it, about Lena being left sad and lonely, spending the rest of the holiday alone and probably working. Alex notices almost right away, poking her with a foot every time she sinks too far into those thoughts, but even the turkey and stuffing isn\u2019t quite enough to distract her.</p>\n<p>She wishes that she had thought to invite Lena to dinner. Her family would have embraced her, even Alex, and shown her what a holiday weekend is supposed to be like. But instead, she does what she knows would cheer her up if the situation was reversed, and what she never thought she\u2019d do \u2013 she sacrifices her favourite Thanksgiving dessert.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday morning, Kara leaves a container with her two slices of chocolate pecan pie and a note on Lena\u2019s desk. In the neatest writing she could muster, the note reads <em>\u2018I\u2019m thankful for YOU! =)\u2019. </em>At the last minute, she draws a heart on the sticky note, and she leaves it before she can second-guess herself.</p>\n<p>Lena doesn\u2019t mention the gift, but by the time Kara swings by at lunch the pie is gone, and on Wednesday morning the empty, now-cleaned Tupperware is sitting neatly on Kara\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>Their relationship continues as normal after that, or so it seems. They keep teaching, keep laughing and working together, keep staying in their cozy classroom long into the night every 2 weeks even when it only takes them 2 hours to really finish the work that needs to be done. It\u2019s <em>nice</em>, and manageable - and even when she feels like her heart is overflowing because she\u2019s looking at Lena at 9pm on a Tuesday, all rumpled and soft with her hair finger-combed and her glasses sliding down her nose, she thinks she can handle it. Lena is unattainable, absolutely meant for better things, and Kara is content to adore her from afar. A lonely parishioner just happy to be in Lena\u2019s orbit.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s handled, and it\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>Until it isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s will finally breaks in December.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a completely innocuous moment, too. Her resistance to Kara\u2019s charm held up through months of psychological torture \u2013 Kara practically stripping on day 1 of their shared class, that moment at parent-teacher night where she could almost feel feather-light lips on hers, Kara turning up to school in a skirt and somehow probing into the intimate details of Lena\u2019s past and leaving pie on her desk that she <em>knows</em> is Kara\u2019s favourite. Days and weeks and months of fastidious self-control, and it\u2019s broken by a moment so commonplace that Lena hardly realizes it\u2019s happening until it\u2019s too late.</p>\n<p>Their usual bi-weekly work sessions have gotten more frequent lately, their lesson planning expanding to include grading papers and marking quizzes together, doing test experiments (just to prevent further bottle-rocket incidents, of course) and creating new project ideas. It\u2019s time that Lena treasures, one of the only times she finds that she can be fully herself around another person, and Lena curses herself for putting that on the line.</p>\n<p>On this particular December night, she and Kara are at the school later than usual - it\u2019s dark outside, the wind whistling past the windows, and their classroom is cozy and warm, dimly half-lit by the white Christmas lights Kara strung up over the whiteboard last week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kara does look particularly good today, if that can be considered an explanation for Lena\u2019s temporary lapse in judgement \u2013 she\u2019s in tight pants and a vest that accentuates her shoulders, with her hair in a tight bun that\u2019s gotten looser as the night wore on. The shirt is slightly unbuttoned, and Lena has spent most of the night trying to avert her eyes from the patch of skin it reveals. Lena herself has taken off her shoes and rubbed off her lipstick for the day, sitting cross-legged on her desk chair with her hair in a messy bun. She\u2019s not feeling sexy, or confident \u2013 she\u2019s not feeling much about herself one way or the other, at that particular moment. She\u2019s just existing, with Kara nearby being beautiful and untouchable as usual.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Kara says casually, taking a sip of lukewarm hot chocolate, \u201cI think their marks on the chem section of the test are better than the physics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because physics is more difficult,\u201d Lena fires back without looking up from the test she\u2019s marking. It\u2019s Eve Tessmacher, and when Lena tallies her grade she\u2019s happy to see she\u2019s earned a 96. She scribbles an \u2018A+\u2019 in the top corner, and on second thought, she adds a smiley face for encouragement.</p>\n<p>She ignores how she can feel Kara\u2019s influence in the decision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should really suggest that Eve joins the mathletes before the competition next month,\u201d Lena mutters, putting Eve\u2019s test aside and picking up another. \u201cShe\u2019s got the highest mark in the class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood idea. Clearly we reeled her in with chemistry, since it\u2019s the superior science,\u201d Kara says with faux-smugness, and Lena groans, finally looking up from her marking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason that Einstein was a physicist and not a <em>chemist</em>, Kara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t smart enough for chemistry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, shut <em>up</em> \u2013\u201c Lena laughs, throwing her pen in Kara\u2019s direction. She means for it to be a playful way to make a point, but the pen ends up sailing through the air with devastating accuracy, and it hits Kara\u2019s forehead with a hollow <em>smack</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Kara exclaims, looking as shocked as Lena feels that the pen hit its mark. There\u2019s a crooked line of ink across her skin, and Lena is all set to apologize and offer Kara a paper towel to clean it off when a rubber eraser bounces off her head, landing on the desk in front of her.</p>\n<p>All it takes is a glance at Kara\u2019s outstretched hand and challenging grin, and within moments it\u2019s an all-out war.</p>\n<p>Balled-up paper and pieces of chalk fly between them, landing with clatters all over the floor and desks and Lena loses track of her usual buttoned-up dignity, lost in a fit of giggles and Kara Danvers\u2019 mischievous smile. Kara is nimble, but Lena is determined, and after a few rounds of merciless combat, she manages to hit Kara square in the face with a large painted sponge model of Venus.</p>\n<p>Kara, not one to concede defeat, just laughs breathlessly and pins Lena to the lab counter.</p>\n<p>As abruptly as it began, their fight ends with their hips flush and their faces inches apart, winded and suddenly still.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a throb deep inside Lena, in the pocket of her hipbones, a deep pull that threads up to her chest and makes her breathing short. Kara smells so good, and her eyes are zeroed in on Lena\u2019s lips, and this feels suddenly inevitable \u2013 the crackling tension that\u2019s existed between them for years reaching its capacity, and slowly, inexorably spilling over.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s face is close now, so close that she can feel her warm breath and it smells like peppermint hot chocolate and it feels like she\u2019s going against every single instinct in her body to deny this \u2013 the wall she has built up around her desire is cracking, and with Kara pressed hot and wanting to her, there\u2019s nothing she can do to stop it.</p>\n<p>She lurches forward, their lips connect, and a crack becomes a canyon.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a moment that Lena has only ever let herself think about at her weakest, when she\u2019s had one too many glasses of wine or she\u2019s feeling the occasional aching loneliness that her empty apartment can sometimes bring. In her idle daydreams, Kara\u2019s lips are soft. She kisses deeply, holding Lena like she\u2019s something precious, like she\u2019s deserving of gentle treatment and devotion. Her hands usually cup Lena\u2019s face, and her kisses trail down Lena\u2019s body with a similar tenderness.</p>\n<p>In reality, Kara\u2019s lips are even softer than Lena imagined \u2013 but her kisses are not.</p>\n<p>Kara kisses like the world is going to end. After a moment of surprised hesitation at the bold move, her hands go to Lena\u2019s hips and she presses in with a kind of force that Lena didn\u2019t know she was capable of. The lab table digs into her lower back, but she couldn\u2019t care less because Kara\u2019s tongue is in her mouth and she\u2019s pulling Lena\u2019s leg up until it wraps around her waist and slipping her own thigh into the space and <em>pressing</em> until Lena whimpers, her hands fisted helplessly in the collar of that crisp blue shirt.</p>\n<p>Lena thought she would be timid \u2013 but Kara Danvers kisses with the intensity of the sun, hot and focused, and Lena melts under the attention.</p>\n<p>Her hands unclench from Kara\u2019s collar and slip under it, spreading over hot skin, and Kara bites down on her lower lip with a groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena \u2013\u201c Kara whispers against her lips, and it sounds like desperation, like reverence, like something close to what Lena has been feeling all these months has been concentrated into a single word breathed into her own mouth by Kara, and it would be so easy to surrender, so easy to just spread herself open inside and out and let her in \u2013</p>\n<p>Down the hall a door slams open, and the sounds of a mini radio and a push-broom break the silence of the building. It\u2019s like a spell is broken - they spring apart violently, panting and blushing like teenagers. Lena\u2019s foot hits the floor, and her hair is somehow down again, the elastic lying on the floor under a nearby desk.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a few thick moments between them where Lena feels suspended, stuck in the moment before a freefall \u2013 until, almost simultaneously, they break eye contact and start gathering their things in silence. There\u2019s a tremor in Lena\u2019s hands as she blindly shoves folders into her bag, and she\u2019s grabbing her coat and out the door before Kara has even gathered all of her papers from the desk. In what feels like a heartbeat she\u2019s sitting in her car, her forehead leaning on the cold steering wheel, taking deep and measured breaths.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, god. Oh god, oh god, oh <strong>god</strong> -</em>\n</p>\n<p>She knows that she\u2019s made a mistake. A <em>huge</em> mistake, and one that she\u2019s probably going to spend the next year trying to clean up. But <em>god</em>, for a moment, when Kara was pressed to her with that startling passion, Lena could almost entertain the idea of something more.</p>\n<p>Almost.</p>\n<p>The night is sleepless, and Lena spends every moment of it dreading the dawn. She has absolutely no idea how she\u2019s going to manage seeing Kara this morning \u2013 she\u2019s almost relieved when Kara\u2019s car isn\u2019t in the parking lot as she pulls in, knowing that she\u2019ll at least be safe until she can reach the comfort of her office.</p>\n<p>She has two full periods before she has to see Kara today, and by the time the adjoining door opens and the blonde appears looking almost as tired as Lena feels, she\u2019s so on-edge that she\u2019s concerned she might give herself a heart condition.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Kara,\u201d Lena says quietly, her entire body taut with suspense as she prepares to either fight or fly. But Kara, after only a moment\u2019s hesitation, just smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Lena.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s that.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no uncomfortable discussion, no moment where she has to break Kara\u2019s heart by telling her a relationship is a bad idea. Just a moment of adjustment, and it\u2019s like nothing ever happened.</p>\n<p>There are a few moments of tension throughout the day \u2013 Kara brushed a little too closely by Lena during class, and she thought that her heart might beat right out of her chest \u2013 but for the most part, things are back to normal. Kara is there bright and early to hold the door for her the next morning like usual, her sunny smile back in place, and after a week or two Lena starts to think that maybe the whole thing was just a fever dream.</p>\n<p>Well, until Kara does something simple like stretch her arms over her head or bite her lip as she writes on the board, and Lena is transported back to being pinned to the lab desk she\u2019s leaning on with Kara\u2019s tongue in her mouth.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the month of December is a stressful one.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that, a week before Christmas break, she strides into her classroom to find it decorated floor-to-ceiling exclusively in mistletoe.</p>\n<p>James Olsen, she knows, is in charge of the decorating committee \u2013 but this particular trick seems beyond him. Lena suspects that Alex is behind it, and it a few of their students seem far too smug and unsurprised at the d\u00e9cor when they enter the room. She\u2019s sure that bribery was involved.</p>\n<p>She tries to work through it. Making a fuss would only make things worse, and the best thing to do is act completely unbothered. But unfortunately, Lena is pretty sure that the blush doesn\u2019t leave her face all day, because all she can think about is the fact that they <em>have</em> kissed. They kissed right there, under that exact sprig of mistletoe, and it\u2019s been two weeks but she can still feel Kara\u2019s lips, can still feel the arousal that zips all the way to her toes at the way Kara\u2019s strong hands pulled her thigh up until it hooked around \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Luthor?\u201d</p>\n<p>She startles violently out of her thoughts to see 16 faces staring up at her with concern. One student has his hand up, and she can tell from the look on the other students\u2019 faces that it\u2019s been a while \u2013 the class is a work period to prepare for mid-term exams in January, but she still shouldn\u2019t be <em>daydreaming</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Andrew. What do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Christmas break finally arrives, it\u2019s a relief that feels bone-deep. She needs the time away \u2013 away from Kara, away from this mistletoe-festooned hell, away from being faced every single day with the reminder of her own bad decision.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s all packed and ready to leave when she pauses at the door, looking towards Kara\u2019s classroom.</p>\n<p>They won\u2019t see each other for two weeks, she reasons. She should probably say goodbye, and wish her happy holidays. As a friend.</p>\n<p>When she eases the door open, Kara is in her office, packing up her things \u2013 a small menorah, a few folders and binders, some small gifts from students. She\u2019s lit by a desk lamp, her loose hair taking on a golden glow. There\u2019s no reason to linger, but Lena can\u2019t help herself \u2013 she stands in the doorway for a few moments before Kara notices her, just soaking her up.</p>\n<p>Kara startles when she turns around to see Lena standing silently in the entrance to her classroom, but the shock quickly turns into a genuine smile, and she steps out of her office and towards Lena.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena! I thought you\u2019d left already?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m about to. I just wanted to wish you happy holidays.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara grins, ushering her over, and Lena sets her coat down on a table as Kara leans against the wall next to the whiteboard. There\u2019s a small wrapped gift on the front lab table, and Kara gestures to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to just leave this in your office for after the break, but since you\u2019re here\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lena says, thrown off guard. \u201cI didn\u2019t get you anything?\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay! It\u2019s just a tiny thing, but I really wanted you to have it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s wrapped beautifully, and Kara shifts a little apprehensively as Lena carefully peels back the paper and tape and reveals \u2013</p>\n<p>A \u2018women of NASA\u2019 Lego set.</p>\n<p>Little plastic figures of Margaret Hamilton, Nancy Roman, and Sally Ride are featured on the box, which proudly boasts \u2018231 pieces!\u2019 underneath the \u201810+\u2019 age recommendation. It\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t need, a child\u2019s toy with too much significance \u2013 but Kara <em>remembered</em>. She remembered Lena's stupid little childhood story, and she cared enough to buy it for her.</p>\n<p>Lena looks from the gift, to Kara\u2019s slightly nervous face, and slowly puts it on the desk beside her. It\u2019s like she\u2019s barely controlling her actions \u2013 something has taken hold of her, made her feel like a creature possessed.</p>\n<p>Kara looks confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo \u2013 do you like it?\u201d Kara asks quietly, and Lena swallows hard. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but I saw it and I thought of you \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>But Lena is already striding forward, grabbing her by her lapels, and crashing their lips together for the second time.</p>\n<p>Kara takes a few beats to respond, her hands frozen in the air on either side of Lena\u2019s face, but when she finally seems to realize what\u2019s happening she\u2019s immediately lithe. She grabs Lena by the hips, lifting her fully and slamming her against the whiteboard hard enough that the breath whooshes out of her \u2013 she should feel alarmed, or annoyed at being manhandled, but all she feels is pure, liquid heat pooling between her legs as Kara grinds her hips forward.</p>\n<p>And their kisses are <em>just</em> as good as Lena remembers \u2013 just as sensual, Kara\u2019s tongue hot in her mouth and her teeth digging into Lena\u2019s lip with the <em>exact</em> right amount of pressure. She drags her short nails down the back of Kara\u2019s neck, and her hips cant forwards. Lena\u2019s dress has ridden up so far that she\u2019s almost entirely exposed and, god help her, she\u2019s arching into the pressure, she\u2019s spreading her legs in her place of work and if Kara decides to slip a hand down, there\u2019s absolutely no way Lena is going to stop her \u2013</p>\n<p>Outside, a shrill, wailing police siren whizzes by and continues down the road, completely unaware of the moment that breaks apart in its wake. Again the spell is broken, and like polarized magnets they spring apart.</p>\n<p>This time, it\u2019s much less easy to ignore what her body is telling her. Screaming at her, really. Kara\u2019s hair is mussed and Lena\u2019s lipstick is smeared over half her face, her glasses askew. She looks debauched and dazed, and Lena is pretty sure she looks the same way, with her hair messy and her skirt sitting just below her waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013\u201c Kara starts, her voice hoarse and soft. \u201cLena \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy holidays, Kara,\u201d Lena blurts, grabbing her gift and running for her life.</p>\n<p>She leaves her coat behind along with Kara, blinking at her retreating form, but she absolutely cannot go back \u2013 she practically runs to her car, shivering but somehow still feeling molten. There\u2019s still a fullness between her thighs, and they glide together with slickness every time she takes a step.</p>\n<p>She isn\u2019t entirely sure how she gets home, but finally she\u2019s dropping her keys onto the kitchen counter and stepping out of her shoes, uncharacteristically leaving them in the hallway. She flicks the light on in her bathroom and she\u2019s alarmed at the sight of herself \u2013 she looks worse than she thought, with crimson stained over her mouth and neck and a small hickey forming just under her jaw.</p>\n<p>She cleans it off slowly and methodically, then steps out of her dress, groaning when she realizes that there\u2019s whiteboard marker dragged all over the back. There\u2019s probably a Lena-shaped smudge in the writing on Kara\u2019s board, and she\u2019s going to have to go back tomorrow and erase the whole thing to get rid of the evidence.</p>\n<p>And get her coat. <em>Christ</em>.</p>\n<p>But she can curse her own lack of willpower tomorrow. Right now she feels like she\u2019s run a marathon, and she sinks into bed without so much as heating up leftovers for dinner. Her dreams are plagued by blonde hair and soft lips, strong hands pinning her to the sheets and hips grinding, <em>grinding</em> \u2013</p>\n<p>She wakes up sweaty and exhausted, aching in the worst way, and she resigns herself to a long, cold shower before she sneaks back into Kara\u2019s classroom to wipe away all evidence of her second ill-advised decision.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lena Luthor is the single most confusing person Kara has ever met.</p>\n<p>The last month has been, without question, both the best and worst of Kara\u2019s life. She\u2019s spent it exhilarated and terrified in equal measure \u2013 full of the memory of Lena\u2019s lips, and unsure how to handle the situation.</p>\n<p>Their first kiss had been electric. It came out of nowhere, a moment of silliness morphing into Lena with her hands on Kara\u2019s skin and her thighs parted, and Kara wishes she could know where things would have gone had they not been interrupted. And their second kiss was somehow even better \u2013 Lena initiated it, and the little noises she made as her hips were moving into Kara\u2019s before they were interrupted <em>again</em> has been seared into her brain for a week.</p>\n<p>And now, even with two mind-numbing, life-changing kisses between them, not a word has been spoken about it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s partially her fault, she knows. There had been a moment, the day after their first kiss, where Kara had considered asking Lena to sit down and talk it through. But Lena had looked so worried, so wide-eyed and uncharacteristically terrified, that Kara taken in to the easier option. She stayed quiet, and tried to move on.</p>\n<p>And then it happened again.</p>\n<p>Normally, Kara is all about healthy communication. But the smaller, more base part of her brain, the part that remembers tasting Lena\u2019s perfume on her neck and the part that\u2019s hoping it might happen again, is resisting. Trying to talk about whatever strange, nebulous magnetism is between them will lead to the undeniable fact that Lena doesn\u2019t want a relationship, that she\u2019s eventually going places that Kara in her inferior intelligence can\u2019t follow, and as bad as it is, she wants to live in this little fantasy a while longer. One where Lena looks at her with thinly-veiled desire, and they exist in a strange limbo between <em>friend</em> and <em>something</em> <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, their second kiss happened the day before Winter Break, and now Kara has another full week of wanting desperately to see Lena, while being too nervous to reach out first. She <em>misses</em> her, with a sharp desire she\u2019s never really felt before. Her only distraction is Alex, but Alex wants to work on their spring curriculums, and working on anything school-related just makes the missing even worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide on a final project for my journalism class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex doesn\u2019t look up from her laptop, her fingers flying over the keys. \u201cJust make them create a newspaper. Wasn\u2019t that what you were planning to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah, but\u2026I want it to be really good,\u201d Kara counters, her own word document stubbornly blank.</p>\n<p>\u201cA newspaper <em>is</em> a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, like, <em>really</em> good,\u201d Kara argues. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that Cat even let me offer this class \u2013 I need to prove that it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, your students love you. They\u2019ll give you great feedback no matter what.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex is right, she knows. She closes the doc with a huff, trying to find something else for her brain to focus on besides the memory of how Lena\u2019s red lipstick looked smudged all over her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d she mutters, scrolling through her work folder. \u201cI need to work on my semester 2 introductory chem lecture, too \u2013 I\u2019m sure I can make it as good as Lena\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working on that <em>with</em> Lena?\u201d Alex asks distractedly, and Kara is grateful that her sister\u2019s eyes are glued to the screen because her sudden blush is impossible to hide.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 well, we can work on things by ourselves. We don\u2019t <em>have</em> to be together \u2013\u201c she stammers, and to her horror, Alex looks up with a suspicious expression at the nervousness in her voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve used it as an excuse to hang out with her all semester. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Kara insists, but her voice has gone all high-pitched like it always does when she\u2019s trying to lie, and Alex knows it. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s the holidays, and I don\u2019t want to bother \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cLuthor doesn\u2019t <em>do</em> holidays. Even I know that,\u201d Alex says, and Kara feels a bit like a rabbit cornered by a bloodhound. Alex has caught the scent of her lie, and she won\u2019t stop until Kara spills.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just \u2013 we \u2013 I don\u2019t want it to be \u2013\u201c Kara grasps at straws, until finally Alex rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, just spit it out!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe kissed.\u201d</p>\n<p>It slips out surprisingly easily, in the end. As if she\u2019s just been waiting to tell Alex, to tell <em>someone</em>. It feels like a weight is lifted, even with Alex looking at her like she\u2019s just revealed her intention to quit teaching and start a new career as a mime.</p>\n<p>Honestly, there are moments\u00a0when she\u2019d seriously consider running away to the circus. This being one of them.</p>\n<p>Alex blinks at her for a few seconds, each one compounding Kara\u2019s anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you <em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn our classroom. Twice.\u201d</p>\n<p>The more Kara tells, the more she <em>wants</em> to tell. Although, she\u2019s not sure Alex would appreciate knowing the intimate details. Alex, for her part, is still working on processing the information.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Alex says slowly, her brow furrowed, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you kissed Lena Luthor, <em>twice</em>, and you\u2019re not at her apartment <em>right now?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m telling you,\u201d Kara sighs, abandoning her laptop and flopping back on the couch. \u201cBoth times, she just sort of \u2013 disappeared, afterwards.\u201d <em>\u2018Ran away\u2019</em> is probably a more accurate description, but Alex doesn\u2019t have to know that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d Alex mutters, rubbing her forehead. \u201cI strung your classes in mistletoe as a <em>joke</em>, I didn\u2019t think \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was <em>you</em>?\u201d Kara exclaims, sitting abruptly upright. \u201cLena was spaced out all day because of that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it was me, doofus,\u201d Alex says with a dismissive hand wave. \u201cHave you talked to her about all of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kara says sheepishly, and Alex smacks her on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara leans away from the flying hands, her own raised in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d Alex says incredulously, and Kara sighs, trying to explain her thought process.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we talk about it, it might\u2026stop,\u201d Kara admits quietly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want it to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>Kara</em>,\u201d Alex sighs, pity evident in her voice. Kara shrugs it off.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It probably won\u2019t happen again anyways, because she\u2019s way out of my league. She\u2019s a beautiful genius, and \u2013 and it was probably just a spur of the moment thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Two</em> spur of the moment things,\u201d Alex reminds her, quite unhelpfully. Kara glares at her, but from the amused look on Alex\u2019s face, it\u2019s likely that her authority is compromised by the holiday-themed snowflake footie pajamas she\u2019s wearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to force you to do anything, but I am going to beg you to remove your head from your ass and talk to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to ignore you,\u201d Kara replies, already putting in headphones and turning Spotify to full volume.</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough, but you know I\u2019m right,\u201d Alex yells, and Kara can hear it even through the ABBA being played at an ear-shattering decibel.</p>\n<p>Alex is right, as always. Kara should do the difficult thing \u2013 she should talk to Lena, and put this whole thing to bed one way or the other. But, not today.</p>\n<p>And, apparently, not any day in January either. The holidays come and go, and their school routine goes on unchanged. Kara keeps bracing herself for another encounter every time they end up alone in the classroom, but so far there\u2019s nothing to suggest that Lena even <em>remembers</em> the first two kisses, let alone wants to do it again. She treats Kara the same way she always has \u2013 with friendship tempered by distance, occasional moments of softness swiftly covered with deflection.</p>\n<p>The only indication that Kara didn\u2019t make the whole thing up in her head is the way she catches Lena looking at her sometimes, when she wears something short-sleeved or particularly tight. She\u2019s sure that it\u2019s only surface-level, not the deep yearning that she feels whenever Lena is in the room \u2013 the idea that Lena could want anything beyond the physical with her when she\u2019s clearly meant to change the world is ludicrous - but it\u2019s <em>something</em>, and she clings to it.</p>\n<p>It all almost feels normal by the time the Mathletes go to their mid-year competition in Gotham. She and Lena, being the only chaperones, spend days making last-minute preparations. They arrange buses and room assignments, inform restaurants about food allergies and verify emergency contact information, and she hardly has time to think about anything besides hoping the weekend goes smoothly.</p>\n<p>So, naturally, the weekend does not go smoothly.</p>\n<p>It has nothing to do with the students \u2013 the Mathletes tend to be a tame bunch, all too fond of herself and Lena to get into too much trouble. Eve Tessmacher made a great addition to the team, and everyone accepts their room assignments happily.</p>\n<p>With all the time they spent on rooms for the students, she really should have double-checked her own accommodations.</p>\n<p>While Lena wrangles the students into groups to go up in the elevator and get settled into their rooms, Kara frowns at the piece of paper in her hand. Two keycards are tucked into the little pocket underneath a room number, and two names are listed under <em>\u2018occupant(s)</em>\u2019: herself, and Lena.</p>\n<p>Both. On one sheet.</p>\n<p>With a growing sense of dread, she turns back to the front desk attendant.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asks quietly, glancing behind her to make sure Lena is still occupied. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a mistake. Myself and my co-worker were only given one room. I was under the impression \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>The attendant at least has the grace to look apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m <em>so</em> sorry, ma\u2019am, but that was the booking I was given. 8 rooms, 7 for students and one for the chaperones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, god.</em>\n</p>\n<p>There are about a thousand things she\u2019d rather do than break the news to Lena that they\u2019re sharing a room. If only to postpone her sentence, she ducks into the stairwell nearby and calls Cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Danvers, I gave you my cell phone <em>in case of emergencies</em>. I sincerely hope that some horrific tragedy hasn\u2019t struck your bus full of students, because otherwise \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Painfully aware that she only has a minute or two before Lena realizes she\u2019s gone, Kara interrupts her boss nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a question about room assignments, Miss Grant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cat sighs, and Kara has the sneaking feeling that the call is going to be futile. \u201cI thought this might come up. There\u2019s a conference at your hotel this weekend, and one room was all that could be booked for you. I trust you can handle sharing a room for one night?\u201d</p>\n<p>She seems far too pleased with herself, and no matter how much Kara politely protests, the answer is the same \u2013 she and Lena are bunking together. And, because fate is a cruel and uncaring bastard, the door swings open after a very tense elevator ride to reveal a single Queen bed.</p>\n<p>After a moment of hesitation Lena strides into the room, her back ramrod straight, and sets her things on the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena\u2026\u201d Kara says hesitantly, \u201cI\u2019m sure I can go to another hotel. Or, sleep on the floor or something \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Lena laughs humourlessly, the sound clashing with her white-knuckle grip on the handle of her overnight bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown woman, Kara. I can handle sharing a bed with another adult.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara swallows, her mouth feeling oddly dry at the abrupt shut-down.</p>\n<p>Despite Lena\u2019s insistence that the accommodations aren\u2019t a problem, she seems to be determined to put off going to bed for as long as possible. She leaves the room for almost a full hour to get ice, and when she gets back it takes her much longer than it should to get changed in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Kara sits on the bed while she waits, drumming her fingers on her knees and feeling slightly self-conscious about her Cookie Monster flannel pajama pants.</p>\n<p>When Lena finally emerges in cotton shorts and a grey MIT t-shirt, Kara\u2019s hands clench into fists involuntarily as she fights to smother the strangled noise that tries to fight its way up her throat.</p>\n<p><em>Just co-workers sharing a bed</em>, she chants silently. <em>Don\u2019t be weird about it, don\u2019t look at her thighs, this is just two co-workers sharing a bed</em> \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d be \u2013\u201c Lena gestures self-consciously at her outfit, pulling the hem of her shorts down to cover more of her legs. But all it does is reveal a sliver of her stomach at the base of her shirt, and Kara has never felt like a bigger creep in her life for how desperately she wants to run her tongue along it.</p>\n<p>The bed dips as Lena slips under the covers, and side by side they both stare up at the ceiling by the light of the bedside lamp. The silence is thick, broken occasionally by bouts of laughter from the students in neighboring rooms, and Kara can feel her pounding heartbeat in every part of her body.</p>\n<p>And yet strangely, nothing happens.</p>\n<p>It seems <em>different</em> here, more intimate somehow in a way that Kara isn\u2019t equipped to handle. In their dimly lit classroom, the outside world seeming far away, it\u2019s easy to throw logic out the window and succumb to desire \u2013 but here, in a soft bed, in a well-lit hotel room surrounded by their students, it would feel too deep. Too <em>real</em>.</p>\n<p>No matter how badly she wants to roll over and feel exactly how soft Lena\u2019s skin is.</p>\n<p>So instead Kara switches off the lamp and they lie together, both completely still and not daring to touch. She knows she\u2019s not sleeping, and she knows that Lena\u2019s not sleeping, and she knows that Lena knows neither of them are sleeping, but she can\u2019t bring herself to make a move.</p>\n<p>Alex\u2019s voice echoes in her head \u2013 <em>get your head out of your ass and</em> <em>talk to her</em> \u2013 but she can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too risky.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost dawn when she finally drifts to sleep. She mostly dozes, in and out of a deeper sleep, and it feels like only a few minutes later when she jerks awake to the sound of 10 sets of fists banging on the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Danvers! Miss Luthor!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for breakfast!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re still sleeping? They could be \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shhh</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>She cracks her eyes open, groaning at the sunlight filtering through the inadequate curtains. Her neck is stiff, and her legs are tangled in something \u2013 something heavy, something that\u2019s also weighing down her torso and breathing little puffs of hot air into her neck \u2013</p>\n<p>Lena is on top of her. Somehow, during their 2 hours of sleeping, they both seem to have migrated to the middle of the bed and fully into each other\u2019s space, and somehow Lena hasn\u2019t even stirred yet despite the increasing volume of the teenagers outside. Her chest feels tight, and it\u2019s not because Lena\u2019s entire torso is pressing it into the mattress.</p>\n<p>Desperate to not have this conversation, Kara slips out from underneath Lena\u2019s weight as quickly as she can and darts out of bed. She hears Lena make an adorable disgruntled noise at being disturbed, but she\u2019s already opening the door a crack and peeking out at the 14 Mathletes standing in the hallway in their pajamas.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about you guys go get dressed, and Miss Luthor and I will be out in 5 minutes?\u201d she whispers, trying to keep the plea out of her voice.</p>\n<p>The kids disperse, giggling. Kara closes the door behind them and leans her forehead on it. Behind her the bathroom door squeaks, and Kara only sees a flash of grey cotton and messy black hair before it closes with a snap.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Time to face the day.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Despite both of their teachers running on empty, their team wins.</p>\n<p>The trophy is cheap plastic and probably came from the dollar store, but it\u2019s theirs. The bus ride back to National City is full of laughter and recounting Eve\u2019s badass last-minute answer that clinched the final round, and by the time the bus pulls into the school parking lot and the students start to scatter into their parents cars, Kara has almost forgotten the fact that she\u2019s barely slept in 36 hours.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s the lack of sleep or just the happiness of the trip back, but Kara feels mischievous. She holds the trophy up to the evening light, and it glints off the gold plastic and shines on Lena\u2019s smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d Kara says conspiratorially, \u201cThe janitors don\u2019t lock the doors until 7. Wanna put this bad boy in our classroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not sure why she suggests it. The halls will be empty, their empty classroom devoid of prying eyes, and the closer they get to it the more a familiar feeling of inevitability creeps in. She turns on her office light but leaves the harsh fluorescents off, and together they pull a table up and stand on it to set the trophy on a small ledge above the whiteboard. When Kara jumps back down, dusting off her hands, she lands so close to Lena that the shorter woman stumbles a little, leaning back against the table.</p>\n<p>This is dangerous ground. They\u2019re entering the rapids, and Kara doesn\u2019t have so much as a life jacket. But then Lena\u2019s hands land gently on Kara\u2019s chest, her eyes dragging up to meet Kara\u2019s, and drowning doesn\u2019t seem so bad.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t know who leans in first this time, but the next thing she\u2019s aware of is having Lena pinned to a surface in their classroom for the third time, and it rockets from zero to a 100 in seconds.</p>\n<p>Without hesitation she lifts Lena onto the desk and her legs wrap around Kara\u2019s waist, her nails digging into the back of Kara\u2019s neck. It\u2019s almost frenzied, as if Lena is trying to purge the desire from her system, and Kara is just clinging on for the ride. She can feel the heat radiating off her through several layers of clothing, and the tiny, desperate noises she\u2019s making are more frequent than she remembers, and she has no idea why she keeps resisting this when it feels so good, so <em>natural</em>.</p>\n<p>Kara is still stunned that this is even possible \u2013 that Lena is attracted to her in any capacity, let alone enough to want to kiss her \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t let herself think about it for too long, smothers the voice that whispers in her head. <em>She\u2019s too good for you. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>She\u2019s too good for everyone.</em>\n</p>\n<p>But Kara is too far gone now to stop. Her face is buried in Lena\u2019s neck, breathing in the fragrance that haunts her on a daily basis, and Lena\u2019s trembling hand grasps her own and slides it down. Down, down, down, until it\u2019s brushing her inner thighs and she can feel a damp patch of fabric and Lena is whimpering her name -</p>\n<p>The harsh trill of Kara\u2019s cell phone has never in her life been so unwelcome.</p>\n<p>Before Kara can even open her eyes, Lena\u2019s back is disappearing through the door towards the parking lot, and Kara\u2019s arms are hanging in the air around nothing. The only thing left of Lena is the imprint of her lipstick and the ghost of her perfume.</p>\n<p><em>Again</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Kara whispers, raising a shaking hand to her red-stained, tingling lips and remembering where it almost was. Who it was almost inside.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every single year, without fail, Lena wishes that she could justify calling in sick on February 14th.</p>\n<p>The entire school is festooned in pink and red decorations, and passing what seems like 100 teenage couples sucking face and exchanging stuffed animals and candy is enough to make her want to hole up in her apartment for a week. The holiday is saccharine, and clich\u00e9, and cheesy, and for the life of her she cannot stop thinking about Kara Danvers.</p>\n<p>She lost control, a few weeks ago. The Mathletes winning, and the long bus ride, and spending the entire night mere inches away from Kara in a hotel bed \u2013 all of it had compounded until she lost her head. At least, that\u2019s what she\u2019s been telling herself. That night, when she\u2019d been dragging Kara\u2019s hand towards her panties in the middle of her workplace, she hadn\u2019t been thinking about justifications. She\u2019d just been thinking about how <em>incredible</em> Kara\u2019s hand was going to feel on her \u2013</p>\n<p>Anyways.</p>\n<p>They haven\u2019t spoken about it since, and it is <em>not</em> happening again, no matter how many heated looks she catches Kara giving her when she\u2019s trying to talk about the fundamentals of electricity.</p>\n<p>So, Valentine\u2019s Day vexes her. She has her joint class with Kara in the afternoon instead of the morning, at least, which gives her a little bit more time to prepare herself before Kara marches in and hands her a cheap piece of folded paper featuring Bugs Bunny asking her to \u2018Be Mine\u2019, but her heart still flutters traitorously when Kara winks.</p>\n<p>Kara asked specifically to take charge of the class today and Lena had surrendered the reins happily at the time, just glad to not have to think up some silly way to link the holiday with Physics. But now, it means she has to spend most of the class time watching Kara talk about how chemistry affects love, and it digs into her in a surprising way.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s lecture is barely even romantic. She\u2019s talking about brain chemistry, about serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine, how rushes of chemicals to the brain during infatuation cause physical symptoms like racing hearts and sweaty palms. She\u2019s essentially telling the class that what they feel is nothing more than biological reactions, scientifically explainable, and yet here Lena is with a racing heart and sweaty palms being swept away by Kara\u2019s easy charisma.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that every time Kara mentions words like <em>euphoria</em> and <em>pleasure</em>, her eyes flick up to meet Lena\u2019s, and the dopamine does its job. She\u2019s practically swooning, memories of their last kiss and exactly how capable of <em>pleasure</em> Kara can be is making her throb with repressed want.</p>\n<p>She hates Valentine\u2019s Day.</p>\n<p>Kara decides to top the class off with a small experiment \u2013 showing the students how to create exothermic reactions (<em>\u2018like how two people meeting can spark in an instant!\u2019</em>) using glycerine and potassium permanganate. She draws a heart with an arrow through it on a flame-proof slab, tilting it up so the class can see, adds drops of glycerine strategically until it starts to smoke, and then sprays it with a slight misting of water.</p>\n<p>Lena had disapproved of the water. It makes the reaction a little unstable, and Kara\u2019s experiments are prone to danger as it is. But Kara insisted that it speeds the reaction up, and Lena had ceded to her expertise.</p>\n<p>She should know by now never to give in to Kara\u2019s ideas.</p>\n<p>The black powder flames out into the shape of a heart, exactly as Kara planned \u2013 for exactly 5 seconds. After that it starts to warp and sputter, and the flame spreads across the flameproof board and onto the lab table as Kara jumps back and swears, grabbing the fire extinguisher.</p>\n<p>And when Kara has sprayed the mangled heart into submission, her shirt covered in tiny smoking black powder spots and her hair in disarray but a happy grin on her face, Lena\u2019s idiotic brain keeps pumping those useless chemicals until her heart feels tight at how ridiculously <em>cute</em> it all is.</p>\n<p>The rest of the day is spent in complete and utter distraction.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the least productive day she\u2019s had in a long time, even including the days after each of their unplanned, irresponsible kisses. She spends it wishing that the day could just be over, and she could go home and curl up with an overflowing glass of wine and just <em>relax</em>.</p>\n<p>So, when a group of other single teachers invite her to go out with them for a \u2018Fuck Valentine\u2019s Day\u2019 drink, Lena initially says no.</p>\n<p>Winn badgers her about it as she tries to pack her things to go home, insisting that it\u2019s going to be a blast and that Kara, Alex, and himself will all be there, but Lena denies him again and again until Kara strolls through their adjoining door. Her hair is down, and she\u2019s changed her fire-shirt for a simple black tank top (her gym shirt is all she had to change into, she insists), and when she leans against the now-cleaned lab table her shoulders flex a little.</p>\n<p>Well. One drink can\u2019t hurt.</p>\n<p>She has three. She reassures herself with the fact that she doesn\u2019t actually get drunk \u2013 she barely gets tipsy. But Kara sticks close to her all night, and the bar seems to exclusively play songs with deep bass lines that make her want to tap into her college instincts, to climb into the taller woman\u2019s lap and <em>grind</em>.</p>\n<p>But she\u2019s an <em>adult</em>, and as an adult she instead sticks to pretending she can\u2019t hear anything Kara says over the music so that they have to lean absurdly close in order to carry on a conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always wanted to see you with your hair down,\u201d Kara says lowly into Lena\u2019s ear, and Lena has to suppress the full-body shudder that results from Kara\u2019s warm breath and the honey-sweetness of her tone. She distracts herself by taking a sip of her almost-empty drink, letting an ice cube melt on her tongue. The coldness gives her something else to focus on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wear my hair down sometimes,\u201d Lena edges, and Kara laughs, the sound rippling down Lena\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean. Like \u2013 chill. Drinking, going out with friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena chuckles, stirring the ice in her glass with the little red bar straw. \u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly my scene. I\u2019m more of a \u2018curl up at home with a good book\u2019 kind of girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo am I, but sometimes you need to <em>let loose</em>,\u201d Kara murmurs, still so close to Lena\u2019s face, and the timbre of her voice dips on the last two words in a way that makes Lena\u2019s entire lower body melt like a popsicle.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I just needed someone to show me how,\u201d Lena replies without thinking, and she hates that she can hear how breathy her own voice sounds.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s pupils visibly dilate, and Lena feels a creeping sense of inevitability.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I shouldn\u2019t have said that.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The night passes too quickly. She surprises herself by having a genuinely good time, and the hint of tipsiness helps her continue to forget her boundaries around Kara - so, when Kara suggests they share a cab home, Lena agrees with almost no resistance.</p>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that Lena is half in her lap and fully in her mouth before they get to the first address.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s lips are just as good as she remembers, just as soft, just as sweet, and their position means she can indulge her earlier instinct and grind herself down into the blonde\u2019s lap all too easily. The pressure makes her groan, and Kara breathes hotly into her mouth, biting down on Lena\u2019s lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you gonna run away this time?\u201d Kara murmurs, and Lena can admit that she does feel the urge to wrench open the car door and tuck-and-roll into the street at the reminder. But she doesn\u2019t \u2013 she just silences Kara the only way she knows how.</p>\n<p>If the rest of the night has passed in a blur, now it seems to move in slow motion. She can feel every inch of Kara\u2019s body, can catalog the exact feeling of her tongue, how she tastes like beer and smells like leather and light cologne and her jaw feels strong and warm under Lena\u2019s fingers. She can feel the very limited amount of time in which she could still back out of this and salvage her self-control slipping away, and then it\u2019s gone, lost to two strong hands gripping her waist and pulling her closer.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s because she\u2019s been drinking, Lena reasons, knowing full well that neither of them have had alcohol in their system for several hours.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why she pulls Kara out of the cab, why she slides her cold hands under Kara\u2019s shirt until she hisses and giggles when she\u2019s trying to open her apartment door. It\u2019s why she willingly steps into Kara\u2019s house, and why she doesn\u2019t think to protest when she\u2019s being pulled up the stairs and pushed through the hall until Kara has her pinned to the inside of the bedroom door.</p>\n<p>It has to be. Nothing but the influence of alcohol could make her strip like her clothes are on fire, or spread herself out naked on Kara\u2019s bed, or pull Kara down to feel warm skin slide against her own from head to toe. And when Kara makes her way down Lena\u2019s body, Lena spreads her legs and fists a hand in Kara\u2019s hair to guide her because she\u2019s obviously very, very drunk.</p>\n<p>The fact that she\u2019s only had 3 watered-down rum and cokes and all were almost 4 hours ago is inconsequential.</p>\n<p>The first touch of Kara\u2019s tongue makes quick work of any plans Lena might have had to leave after one orgasm. She\u2019s so close already, embarrassingly close for having only been naked for under a minute, but it feels like she\u2019s been stuck in suspended foreplay for months now and she\u2019s <em>finally</em> about to cross the finish line.</p>\n<p>She wants to slow down, wants to enjoy this and imprint it in her memory since it\u2019s never going to happen again, but Kara is enthusiastic and determined and <em>skilled</em> and mere seconds later her body finally gives in to what it\u2019s craved since their first kiss. Since before. Coming in Kara\u2019s mouth while those strong arms are wrapped around her thighs to hold her down is everything she\u2019s been craving, and the <em>relief</em> it brings is enough to make her eyes water.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s face is slick when she starts to kiss her way back up again, and it leaves wet trails over Lena\u2019s hipbone, over her belly. She halts when she reaches Lena\u2019s chest, seeming perfectly happy to take up residence there and enjoy herself.</p>\n<p>Lena isn\u2019t usually one for multiples. But Kara is hovering over her, biceps flexing with her own weight and her warm tongue tracing idly around Lena\u2019s nipples purely because she seems to <em>want to</em>, and it\u2019s like she never came at all. More desperate than she\u2019d admit for this night not to end, Lena does the only thing she can. She fists a hand in Kara\u2019s hair and drags her up for a kiss, whispering her next words into Kara\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a one-time, spur of the moment night, Lena thinks two orgasms later, as Kara comes helplessly on her fingers for the first time.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s never going to happen again, after this. She\u2019s never going to feel the way Kara bears down on her hand, never going to hear the way she cries out Lena\u2019s name just before she peaks and whispers it as she comes back down. At first Kara reacts to Lena\u2019s touch like a person who isn\u2019t used to being taken care of, slightly skittish and unsure, but after the third time Kara tries to turn things around and instead Lena just insistently goes down on her again, she seems to relax into it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a snap decision, one she didn\u2019t have time to think about, she maintains even after round 4, when Kara is struggling into the harness and Lena is lying on her back, fingers dancing over her own clit as she waits for it with her legs spread shamelessly.</p>\n<p>She feels molten. Absolutely <em>brazen</em>. She\u2019s come four times, made Kara come three more, and still she\u2019s so desperate for it that she can\u2019t even wait 30 seconds for Kara to get the damn harness on \u2013 she needs the relief of pressure and friction, and watching Kara\u2019s muscles flex as she twists and tightens is absolutely getting her there.</p>\n<p>At the wet sounds that result from Lena rubbing herself with zero finesse and an embarrassing amount of wetness, Kara\u2019s head snaps up, and immediately she abandons the last few steps of tightening and slipping the toy through the ring to drop to her knees and knock Lena\u2019s hand out of the way. She buries her face in Lena\u2019s cunt with a desperate sound, and Lena shouts her approval to the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s clear desperation for her is driving her to new heights, and it feels so fucking <em>good</em> but god, she wants the thing hanging loosely between Kara\u2019s legs. She wants the fullness and the driving force of Kara\u2019s hips, so finally she winds a hand into her hair and tugs. Hard.</p>\n<p>Kara doesn\u2019t budge, just groaning at the sensation and doubling her efforts.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara \u2013\u201c Lena chokes, her whole body arching like a bow as she pulls harder. \u201cI want it, <em>I want</em> <em>it</em>, please, god, I want you inside me, <em>please</em> \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Finally Kara pulls away with a pained groan, her face shiny and flushed. She tightens the last few buckles and secures the toy, and then she\u2019s hovering over her and Lena is practically climbing her in the attempt to just fucking <em>get her inside, already</em> \u2013</p>\n<p>The fervor that sweeps over her when Kara finally eases herself in to the hilt is unparalleled. There\u2019s a fire somewhere inside her, and Kara has just thrown gasoline on it \u2013 and then she has the audacity to start a <em>slow rhythm</em>, to rock their hips together at a trot instead of the full-tilt gallop that Lena <em>needs</em>. It\u2019s so much but it\u2019s not enough, and finally Lena grasps at Kara\u2019s hips herself, slamming them forward and gasping at the electric shock it sends through her nervous system.</p>\n<p>Kara grunts into Lena\u2019s neck, her hips moving slightly faster, but it\u2019s <em>still not fast enough -</em></p>\n<p>\u201cKara,\u201d Lena rasps, digging her blunt nails into muscular shoulderblades and biting down on Kara\u2019s earlobe, \u201cFuck me like you <em>mean it.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>And Kara <em>delivers</em>.</p>\n<p>With a strangled noise she hitches Lena\u2019s legs up until they lock over her back, adjusts her leverage on the bed, and starts a savage, pounding rhythm that Lena <em>knows</em> she\u2019s going to feel tomorrow. She can hear the headboard hitting the wall at an embarrassing volume but she\u2019s well past caring, too busy clinging to Kara\u2019s shoulders and begging for more.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, yes \u2013 god, Kara, just like that, <em>just like that, yes</em> \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Kara reacts to the praise with a whine and speeds up even more, to an almost inhuman pace, and Lena couldn\u2019t stop the avalanche if she tried.</p>\n<p>When she comes, it\u2019s with a shout that could wake the entire neighborhood, and Kara lets out a tiny, overwhelmed groan that makes her think that maybe the feeling is mutual.</p>\n<p>By the time Kara is collapsing on top of her, Lena\u2019s legs wrapped around her hips and her back quivering and sweaty, covered in Lena\u2019s claw marks, she\u2019s run out of excuses. She just musters all of her acrobatic ability and flips them over without losing that fullness for an instant, settling on top of Kara and planting a hand on her chest. And for once, she lets herself be in the moment, where Kara\u2019s resulting delighted grin and firm grip on her hips absolutely lights her on fire.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s alarm clock reads 3:43am when Lena finally slips out of bed, feeling sweaty and bruised and absolutely, mind-numbingly sated.</p>\n<p>Kara fell asleep with the harness still on, the toy discarded on the floor and with Lena on her chest listening to her slowing heartbeat, and Lena worries for her circulation from the tight straps but not enough to wake her up and risk having possibly the most horrific conversation imaginable. Instead she gathers her scattered clothes and dresses as silently as she can, pausing in the doorway to take a mental snapshot of the scene.</p>\n<p>The room is a disaster that reflects the passion of the night. Clothes are thrown over various pieces of furniture and the comforter is in a pile on the floor, and in the middle of it all Kara is sprawled out over half the messy bed, her hair tangled and her face smooth and even in sleep. As Lena watches she reaches a hand out over the sheets and, when she feels no warm body, her placid features shift into a frown.</p>\n<p>Lena takes that as her cue to leave. She only gets 3 hours of sleep, but they\u2019re deep and unbroken, and she feels surprisingly rested when she gets to work. She\u2019s almost cheerful until she hears Kara moving around in her office next door, and she remembers that she\u2019s going to have to talk to her like a functional human being.</p>\n<p>When Kara strolls into the classroom looking far hotter than she has any right to, in chinos and a dark red turtleneck, Lena isn\u2019t prepared.</p>\n<p>Her hair is down, which is rare for when she\u2019s teaching labs, and Lena feels her face get hot when she realizes that the entire ensemble is probably to cover up the fact that Lena left a kaleidoscope of bruises all over her neck last night. She can remember exactly what Kara\u2019s skin tasted like under her teeth, and she has to take several deep breaths through her nose to gain a sense of normalcy again.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Kara,\u201d she finally says, and she\u2019s proud of how even her voice sounds. Kara flushes slightly, but her grin is genuine when she replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Lena.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way her name rolls off Kara\u2019s tongue sends Lena into a tailspin \u2013 she can still hear the way Kara said it last night, the way she groaned it when Lena\u2019s tongue was swirling over her clit, the way she whimpered it when Lena was riding her, the way it was whispered in near-reverence into Lena\u2019s neck as Kara\u2019s hips slammed into her own, building her up to yet another peak \u2013 <em>Lena, god, <strong>Lena</strong></em> \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cLena?\u201d Kara\u2019s real, concerned face swims back into focus and Lena jerks away, smoothing her shaking hands down her skirt. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just a little sore, today.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t even know why it slips out. She <em>is</em> sore, and tired \u2013 last night\u2019s borderline-acrobatic sex is the closest thing she\u2019s had to a workout in years \u2013 but immediately Kara turns pink, and Lena can tell she\u2019s trying not to smile. A moment of understanding passes between them, a moment where Lena knows <em>exactly</em> what Kara is thinking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026me too,\u201d Kara says, her voice low and rich. It makes Lena shiver.</p>\n<p><em>No</em>. No more shivers, no more swooping stomach. Last night happened, she can\u2019t take that back, but now Lena has the whole thing out of her system, and she\u2019s going to move on with her life.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2026it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Lena manages to answer, and the effect is instantaneous. Kara\u2019s face falls slightly, but she nods, clearly understanding the meaning.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Yeah, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena can <em>feel</em> the disappointment that the statement brings. Kara looks like she almost wants to protest, but Lena turns away. She only has so much willpower, and rejecting Kara twice is more than she can take. Kara deserves someone who won\u2019t hurt her just by being herself. Someone better.</p>\n<p>This is the right decision. For both of them.</p>\n<p>They move on from the topic quickly as students start to filter in, and the rest of the class is almost normal. At least, it\u2019s almost this strange normal that she and Kara have settled into in the last few months. They teach their class with only a few shared glances, Lena pretends she isn\u2019t thinking about how Kara looks when she\u2019s driving into her with 7 inches, and one period later Kara is strolling back into Lena\u2019s classroom because she spilled hydrochloric acid on her pants. She ends up having to borrow a pair of Lena\u2019s slacks, which are both far too short and several sizes too big in the hips, and have to be held up by a belt.</p>\n<p>She looks ridiculous, like a child playing dress-up, but the sight of Kara in her clothes somehow still makes Lena feel a little bit hysterical.</p>\n<p>Three days. Lena lasts three days after their night together \u2013 three days of acting normal at work and bringing herself to orgasm after guilty, toe-curling orgasm at home, reliving their moments together as she fucks herself. It\u2019s infuriating, how easily she breaks her own promises to herself \u2013 promises that she\u2019ll forget the whole thing, that she can move past this infatuation, that this is the <em>last time. </em>But, Lena is weak.</p>\n<p>And finally, on day number four, she goes to Kara\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a ridiculous idea. It\u2019s a school night, and she\u2019s just spent the last hour working herself up to a peak that wouldn\u2019t come. Kara\u2019s hands haunt her. Her mouth, her tireless hips \u2013 Lena\u2019s body is craving something she can\u2019t achieve herself, plagued by the memories of the hardest and most satisfying fuck she\u2019s ever had, and after she\u2019s brought almost to tears by her third almost-climax evading her she throws on the nearest clothes and breaks several speed limits driving to the address that she unintentionally memorized when Kara rattled it off to the cab driver.</p>\n<p>She notices things this time around that she didn\u2019t that first night. The door she hammers on is a duplex townhouse, cute and well taken care of. It has several flowerpots on the windowsill and a brightly-painted mailbox next to it. Lena stands on a doormat that features cartoon lemons saying \u2018<em>squeeze the day!</em>\u2019, and when the door swings open, Kara looks genuinely stunned to see her there.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lena</em>?\u201d Kara says, opening the door a little wider and revealing her comfy at-home clothes. \u201cWhat are you -\u201d</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s too much for Lena to resist. Kara looks so fucking <em>sexy </em>in her low-slung joggers and tank top, her hair slightly wet and smelling so strongly of her familiar shampoo, and Lena has been unbearably, incurably <em>horny</em> for 3 straight days, and she truly does not have the patience for pleasantries right now.</p>\n<p>She crashes into the blonde like a comet, pushing Kara into the hallway and pushing her tongue into Kara\u2019s mouth and pushing, pushing, <em>pushing </em>until they both hit the closest wall with a <em>thud</em>.</p>\n<p>And then, she stops pushing.</p>\n<p>She pulls back, instead. Pulls away from Kara\u2019s lips - Kara chases them, eyes still closed, but Lena stops her with a hand on the chest. Blue eyes ease open, then, looking down at her in surprise and wonder. They\u2019re still sharing air, heavy and latent with something unknown, and Lena breathes her next words against Kara\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want this?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of quiet - one where Lena\u2019s heart feels like it\u2019s on the edge of a cliff, a still breeze away from plummeting, and she isn\u2019t sure whether she wants to stay or fall.</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s answer is to bend slightly, lift Lena under the thighs, and slam her into the adjacent wall. Kisses turn hot and deep, an almost frantic meeting of lips and tongues and teeth, and finally, <em>finally</em>, Lena\u2019s three-day itch is scratched.</p>\n<p>Thoroughly. Four times.</p>\n<p>For the second time in a week she gathers her clothes in the dim light of Kara\u2019s bedside lamp, and she can only find one sock and her panties are god only knows where but the silence in the room as Kara watches her with an unreadable expression is too thick, and the instinct to run drives her to leave the house without even putting on her shoes.</p>\n<p>She drives home barefoot, trying to sort through the tangle of emotions in her chest, and to her surprise the most prominent thread seems to <em>not</em> be shame or regret. Those old friends still make themselves known, of course, but they\u2019re drowned out by something else - an undercurrent of intense <em>relief</em>.</p>\n<p>She leaves the wine bottle where it is when she gets home, and she wakes up feeling more refreshed than she has in years.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how it is, for a while. They teach together during the day, their friendly relationship almost untouched; and at night, when Lena is feeling weak, she drives to Kara\u2019s apartment \u2013 making sure to park a few streets away \u2013 and gives in to her guilty pleasure. But always at her behest, and always at Kara\u2019s place.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve established a routine. Lena texts Kara first:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[11:47pm]: <em>Are you home?</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>And Kara replies like clockwork, never more than 3 minutes later.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Kara Danvers [11:49pm]: <em>I can be</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>They still don\u2019t talk, before or afterwards. Lena shows up, Kara pins her against something, they spend several hours with their mouths otherwise engaged, and Lena leaves without saying a word. They\u2019re always back to normal by the next morning \u2013 although, they both take to investing in more scarves and turtlenecks after Lena had to surreptitiously point out that a mark she left on Kara\u2019s chest was showing through the opening of her shirt.</p>\n<p>The making out in random classrooms has stopped, for the most part, because Lena knows now that kissing Kara will inevitably lead to things that she would rather die than be caught doing at school. It\u2019s dysfunctional and probably unhealthy, but right now it\u2019s the only thing keeping Lena sane, and she\u2019s accepted that it\u2019s going to keep happening. She just needs to keep her boundaries up.</p>\n<p>As long as she can do that, as long as this whole thing doesn\u2019t go too far, Kara won\u2019t be hurt when it inevitably has to end. When she discovers that Lena isn\u2019t good for her. That she isn\u2019t good for anyone. Not romantically, anyways.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s fine</em>, she reassures herself like a mantra as she feels an acute physical reaction rising inside her just from watching Kara bend to grab her lunch from the staff room fridge. <em>This is fine.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m fine.</em>\n</p>\n<p>But there are definitely times when she feels she is <em>not fine</em>, and she\u2019s infinitely grateful when her best friend texts her in the middle of the week to announce that she\u2019s finally on the West Coast again. When Jess knocks on her door with two bottles of wine and her always-present lightning wit, Lena fully relaxes for what feels like the first time in weeks.</p>\n<p>Jess is an outsider in this situation. She doesn\u2019t know Kara, doesn\u2019t know their coworkers or students, and she doesn\u2019t put up with Lena\u2019s shit \u2013 and Lena needs a neutral ear to process the shitstorm that her life has become.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jess says, as she tops off both of their glasses and uncorks another bottle. \u201cSo, you\u2019re sleeping with this woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lena replies, swirling the wine in her glass despondently.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho you work with,\u201d Jess continues, as she tallies up the information Lena has told her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s super hot, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbearably,\u201d Lena groans into her glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd amazing in bed?\u201d Jess asks nonchalantly, and Lena sighs, irritated.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jess</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Jess just throws her hands up in surrender. \u201cI need a clear picture! Look, just tell me how many.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many what?\u201d Lena edges, getting an idea of what Jess is asking but unwilling to give up the answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times does she make you come!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus <em>Christ</em>, Jess \u2013\u201c Lena hisses, gesturing for her to quiet down even though it\u2019s just the two of them in Lena\u2019s living room. But Jess won\u2019t give it up, crossing her arms and looking expectant.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want my advice or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena sighs again, picking at her thumbnail. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s ashamed of sex, in any form \u2013 and she trusts Jess, implicitly. It\u2019s just that, with Kara, it feels different. More private, somehow, like revealing any details will ruin this rhythm they have, this secretive routine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 it depends on \u2013\u201c she says haltingly, and Jess pokes her in the side, making her squirm.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Lena, I\u2019ve been single for 7 months. Give me the goods.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c5, on average,\u201d Lena finally mutters, begrudgingly. \u201cUsually more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jess looks at her evenly for a few moments, taking a slow, ponderous sip of her wine. Then she carefully sets the glass down, shifts forward on the couch, and smacks Lena on the side of the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw! What the hell \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t dating this woman <em>why</em>?\u201d Jess yells, and before Lena can prepare for it she smacks her again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c5 on average? <em>On average?</em> Usually <em>more</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena deflects the third smack, but Jess keeps up the tirade.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you not locking this woman <em>down</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Lena finally manages to say, and Jess is surprised enough to stop with the hitting.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s amazing, Jess!\u201d Lena says, willing Jess to understand, but frustratingly her best friend just seems more exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Exactly</em>, so why \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s too good! Okay?\u201d Lena finally yells, and after a few seconds of Jess staring at her like she\u2019s grown a second head, she quiets her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s sweet, and kind, and\u2026and funny, and intelligent. She\u2019s the most giving, selfless person I\u2019ve ever met. And I won\u2019t subject her to the psychological torture of being involved with a Luthor. She deserves better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLena\u2026\u201d Jess says softly, and the irritation is replaced by pity. A deep, long-suffering pity that Lena hates even more than she hates herself for inspiring it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have healthy relationships,\u201d Lena says, matter-of-factly. \u201cWe have business transactions, and minions. We just take, and take, and leave our partners empty and broken. I won\u2019t do that to Kara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your family. That\u2019s not you. Besides, I\u2019m not a minion, am I?\u201d Jess tries to interject, but Lena shakes her head, finishing off her wine.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t count. It\u2019s just\u2026it\u2019s better this way. She won\u2019t get attached. It\u2019s just physical. Friends with benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jess sighs heavily, and it\u2019s a testament to how long they\u2019ve known each other that she knows further argument is futile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep her at arm\u2019s length forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lena agrees. \u201cAnd when I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll cut it off. No hard feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jess looks doubtful, but Lena is at least confident in her ability to cut off relationships. If there\u2019s one thing she can do, it\u2019s clean break-ups. Leaving before anyone gets invested.</p>\n<p>She seals herself in this mental bubble, and determinedly ignores the tiny voice in her head that sounds a lot like Jess.</p>\n<p>The one whispering that it\u2019s already too late.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kara is having sex with Lena Luthor.</p>\n<p>The sentence, the truth behind it, the memories of what Lena allows her to do on more nights of the week than either of them will admit \u2013 it still makes her head spin a little bit. She should have seen it coming, really, after all those kisses, but somehow she never really expected it to actually <em>happen</em>. It\u2019s like assuming that one day you could be having sex with the Pope. It\u2019s technically possible, in a world of infinite variables, but so ridiculously unlikely that you\u2019d never truly entertain the idea.</p>\n<p>Not that having sex with Lena is anything like \u2013 okay, so it\u2019s not the best metaphor. But in Kara\u2019s defense, she hasn\u2019t exactly been getting much sleep lately, what with Lena keeping her up until 2am on most nights as well as having to keep up with work (with Lena) and chaperoning extracurriculars (with Lena). It\u2019s all Lena, all the time. Lena helping her not to melt the Bunsen burner during chem labs, Lena in soft clothes and no makeup after hours while they plan their classes, Lena naked on all fours with Kara slamming her into the mattress.</p>\n<p>Not that Kara is complaining. She has no idea why Lena has decided that Kara is worth her attention, but she\u2019s happy to reap the benefits for as long as she can \u2013 and since the benefits include having the most beautiful woman she\u2019s ever met in various naked positions in her bed more often than not, she does everything she can not to disturb the fragile balance they\u2019ve struck.</p>\n<p>It should be easy. Clearly Lena wants no attachments, not so much as a conversation acknowledging what they\u2019re doing, and Kara can do that. She\u2019s had casual relationships before - prefers them, in fact \u2013 and this should be no different. But it <em>is</em>.</p>\n<p>She feels a longing when Lena silently slips back into her clothes and disappears every night, a sort of yearning that she\u2019s not used to. She wants Lena to stay. She wants to fall asleep together, to wake up together, to lie in bed after they\u2019ve spent the night exhausting each other and just <em>talk</em>. She wants more of those little moments she sometimes manages to wrangle when they\u2019re alone - to learn about Lena\u2019s past, hear her thoughts and opinions on absolutely everything. And, ideally, she\u2019d like to do it naked.</p>\n<p>But she\u2019s too intent on keeping Lena close in the only way she knows how, the only way she feels comfortable, and Lena doesn\u2019t seem to want to change their dynamic either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are strict unspoken rules, silently agreed upon by both of them. No acknowledgement of the arrangement, no talking outside of the heat of the moment, no more kissing unless it\u2019s in a bed, no sleepovers, things stay professional at school. During business hours, their relationship hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 outside them, Lena continues to give Kara the best sex of her life.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a confusing dichotomy. It\u2019s necessary, to keep things casual, but it\u2019s\u00a0difficult to separate the desire to pin Lena to the nearest surface just because they\u2019re at work, especially when Lena strolls into the classroom near the end of the month in a crisp white shirt, fitted vest, and a pencil skirt. Her hair is down, her lipstick is crimson, and Kara wants nothing more than to pull her into the office and rip her nylons in desperation, let those stilettos dig into her back as she gets on her knees on the linoleum.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to resist, but she manages to stick to just meeting Lena\u2019s heated stares, and she gets to give in to her impulses a few hours later when Lena sends her their usual text message and knocks on her door 20 minutes later. Kara strips her down to her bra and nylons, and Lena graciously (and eagerly) lets her rip them down the middle and soothe the day\u2019s frustrations with several rounds of enthusiastic oral.</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s good. More than good, it\u2019s amazing, as long as Kara keeps her walls up, and follows their rules.</p>\n<p>This makes what happens in early March even more confusing.</p>\n<p>Logically, Kara can understand the sequence of events. The gym teacher, J\u2019onn, breaks his ankle in a small car accident and a temporary sub is hired. The sub, Mike Elis, is a smug jock with no sense of boundaries. He hits on Kara in the lunchroom for 4 days straight. Lena also eats in the lunchroom. Lena noticeably stops eating every time it happens.</p>\n<p>These are the facts. But Kara isn\u2019t quite sure how they line up.</p>\n<p>Lena has been pretty clear about her boundaries, and Kara couldn\u2019t possibly be interested in Mike when she has someone like <em>Lena</em>, in whatever capacity she\u2019s allowed to have her. The idea that she might be <em>jealous</em> is so far from Kara\u2019s mind that it seems absurd. But nothing else can explain why, after a lunch period where Mike touches her shoulder and lower back a few too many times, Lena comes barrelling into her office after hours and suddenly Kara is the one being pressed to the wall, Lena\u2019s mouth hot on hers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been weeks\u00a0since they\u2019ve done this \u2013 this classroom dance, this venting of sexual tension via unexpected kisses. Kara half expects Lena to pull away and disappear. But instead, Lena pulls back and says something that takes a sledgehammer to the walls that Kara has been able to hastily throw up around her heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome back to my place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara hesitates, her hands gripping the material of Lena\u2019s skirt.</p>\n<p>This is new. It\u2019s a deviance from the routine \u2013 Lena has never outright <em>asked </em>her to hook up before. It\u2019s always vague hints, the same veiled text messages, and they pretend it never happened until the next time. And they have absolutely <em>never</em> gone to Lena\u2019s place. It\u2019s always Kara\u2019s apartment, and Lena doesn\u2019t even park in her driveway.</p>\n<p>Now, Lena is looking at her with a slightly wild expression, and part of Kara feels like there\u2019s going to be no turning back if she says yes.</p>\n<p>She gives her answer with another deep kiss, punctuating it with a bite to her lower lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara has never had a more dangerous drive in her life. Lena spends it nipping at her jaw, licking the shell of her ear, sliding a hand over her hip to wedge between her thighs and <em>press</em> \u2013 it\u2019s heated and almost possessive, and it probably signals that this nebulous thing between them is a little bit unhealthy, but god, it makes her feel <em>wanted</em>.</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s place turns out to be a house, a cute two-storey in a slightly upscale part of town. Kara wants to look at every detail, but Lena is practically flying out of the car and tugging on her hand insistently as they hurry up the path, and Kara gets the message.</p>\n<p>The moment the door closes behind her, Kara is pressing forward, shucking her own coat and working on Lena\u2019s. She takes note that the house is immaculately clean except for a slightly ajar door at the end of the hallway where Kara can see messy stacks of books and paper spilling from a cluttered desk.</p>\n<p>But Lena pushes her through a different door, already shirtless and ripping insistently at Kara\u2019s buttons, and the state of Lena\u2019s house leaves her mind entirely.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s frantic, at first. Lena seems desperate to get them both naked, and their messy kisses reflect it. But it starts to slow, and Kara isn\u2019t sure who starts the process but eventually they\u2019re spread out on Lena\u2019s bed, so much bigger than Kara\u2019s standard double mattress, and for the first time she\u2019s removing Lena\u2019s bra with steady hands rather than practically ripping it off in haste.</p>\n<p>Usually Lena is insistent, pushing Kara to where she\u2019s needed if she dawdles too long with foreplay, whispering heated instructions and pleas until Kara gives her what she needs. But this time she\u2019s languid, and she lets Kara spend long, luxurious minutes exploring her body in a way she hasn\u2019t had time for previously. Kara sucks at her earlobes, at the freckle on her throat, at her nipples and the soft skin of her ribs. It feels decadent, and the hand that Lena has threaded through her hair doesn\u2019t push for once but just rests there, scratching gently at her scalp and occasionally tugging in a way that Lena has clearly noticed Kara likes.</p>\n<p>When Kara finally slips her fingers between Lena\u2019s spread thighs, she\u2019s so wet that the sound of it is louder than their combined breathing, louder than the breathy whine Lena lets out at the gentle touch. She starts with three fingers instead of working up to it and Lena seems grateful, but even their usual pace is different today.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s slow, and measured, and borderline <em>loving</em>. Kara takes care of Lena, guiding her to peak after peak with a sure hand, and after the fourth time Lena is shaking, nonverbal and clingy. Her face is buried in Kara\u2019s neck, and each stuttered breath seems laden with something more than arousal.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can let go, Lena,\u201d Kara murmurs, kissing every inch of skin she can reach as Lena clings to her shoulders and whimpers. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Lena comes with a sob and Kara feels warm tears that aren\u2019t her own wetting the side of her face where their skin touches, she doesn\u2019t comment. Instead she just lets Lena ride it out, and her heart cracks wide open for this woman that, she can now admit, she\u2019s been in love with for years.</p>\n<p>For a few moments, they just lie together, their bodies cooling and Kara\u2019s fingers still buried. Kara starts to slip out, but Lena grabs at her wrist almost desperately, her eyes still squeezed shut and her teeth clamped down on her lip. She doesn\u2019t say a word, but the meaning is clear.</p>\n<p>It means, <em>stay</em>.</p>\n<p>So Kara does. She stays inside Lena, laying gentle, comforting kisses over her neck and collarbone, her jaw, her hair. It\u2019s a moment of closeness that she never thought she\u2019d experience, and she honestly wishes it would never end \u2013 that she could just stay here, as close to Lena as humanly possible, until the world ends.</p>\n<p>But soon enough Lena shifts in the way that Kara has learned means she\u2019s done for now, and she finally eases herself out, resisting her usual urge to slip her fingers into her mouth. The moment seems too heavy for it. Lena wipes the tears away furiously as soon as Kara pulls away, her jaw tight and flexing while she catches her breath and collects herself, and Kara settles down beside her.</p>\n<p>Averting her eyes to allow Lena some privacy, Kara lets her eyes wander around Lena\u2019s room. It seems to be a clash between order and chaos \u2013 the furniture is all matching, pristine and black against the white walls, but most of the surfaces are covered in coffee mugs and books of some description. Her clothes are organized in the closet by colour and style, but they also lie haphazardly around the laundry basket and draped over a chair in the corner, as if Lena couldn\u2019t choose what to wear this morning and didn\u2019t bother to put them away.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all very endearing, and the canyon in her heart gets deeper.</p>\n<p>At this point in the night, Lena would usually get up and start to gather her things. But they\u2019re at Lena\u2019s house, and she can tell that the unfamiliar terrain is throwing the brunette off.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s throwing Kara off, too. This whole <em>night</em> has thrown her off. Lena\u2019s seeming jealousy, the softness of an act that Kara would usually call fucking but this time seemed like something else, and the tears that came at the end.</p>\n<p>For the very first time, Kara breaks the silence that usually follows their couplings and speaks softly while Lena is still breathing hard next to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing anyone else, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>She almost expected Lena to flinch when she opened her mouth. Her own voice sounds as loud as a gunshot in the familiar silence, but Lena seems to be expecting it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I care about that?\u201d The shaky, emotionally charged tone of Lena\u2019s voice says otherwise, and Kara shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno. Just\u2026making conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena lets out a weary chuckle, tracing a nail over her own belly until a white line appears in its wake, a tiny scratch over the unmarred skin. \u201cSince when do we <em>make conversation</em> when we do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s innocuous, but that little sentence \u2013 the acknowledgement that <em>something </em>is happening here, that <em>this is a thing that they do</em> \u2013 seems to shatter the fragile bubble that\u2019s surrounded them for the last few weeks. Kara laughs, smoothing her sweaty hair away from her face, and Lena sighs, but she\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time Kara has felt light after sleeping with Lena. Usually she goes home feeling heavy, full of bottled feelings and a little bit weary of the eggshells they walk on - this is new, and Kara is relieved at the change.</p>\n<p>\u201cFair point,\u201d Kara acknowledges, and for a moment it seems almost like one of their classroom debates. \u201cBut now that we\u2019ve started, why stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA hundred reasons,\u201d Lena whispers. They\u2019re talking about more than this conversation, now, and they both know it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet, here we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Lena concedes. She stares at the ceiling, and Kara stares at her, and she can <em>tell</em> that Lena knows where her gaze is focused. But she seems determined to ignore it, staring resolutely up, and finally Kara sighs and starts to swing her legs out of bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Lena\u2019s voice calls from behind her, and Kara turns to see her propped on an elbow and looking right at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 uh, I was going to\u2026go home?\u201d Kara offers, pointing at her pants, in a crumpled pile next to Lena\u2019s left shoe.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only come twice,\u201d Lena says, and there\u2019s an air of apology around it. What she feels apologetic for Kara has no idea, but it\u2019s better than the silence, and she laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured you wanted me to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena rolls her eyes, crooking a finger at her. She looks disheveled and ravaged and beautiful, and Kara is climbing back into bed before she can think about it too hard.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange. Three times Kara tries to leave, and three times she\u2019s beckoned back to bed for another round or two \u2013 it\u2019s as if Lena doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> her to go. But she can\u2019t want her to stay over. Right?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nearly 4 when Kara finally manages to get fully dressed. She has to dig around under Lena\u2019s dresser for her keys, which seem to have flown from her pocket at some point, and when she pokes her head back up her eyes catch on something that rests on the surface.</p>\n<p>One \u2018women of NASA\u2019 Lego set, assembled.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the gift Kara got her for the holidays. Lena actually took the time to put it together, putting the little scientist figurines next to their respective machines and displaying it in her bedroom. There\u2019s no other knickknacks in the room, besides books. But Lena keeps this here.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a display of care that Kara didn\u2019t expect.</p>\n<p>Lena doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed Kara\u2019s moment of contemplation, too busy rooting around under her bed and pulling out a fallen pillow to prop under her back. She flops onto it, already pulling her hair into a messy bun. The blanket rests just under her bellybutton, and there\u2019s a mark forming on her breast that\u2019s shaped exactly like Kara\u2019s mouth, and her entire body aches in the sweetest way at the sight of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lena asks when she\u2019s finally settled, raising a brow. Kara just shakes her head, a warm feeling blooming in her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. See you tomorrow, Lena.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaves with a small, secret happiness, and the next day her favourite tea is sitting on her desk after first period with a faint lipstick stain on the lip. Kara takes a sip of it, lining her mouth up to the mark and smiling.</p>\n<p>This thing with Lena can\u2019t last forever, sure. Lena has places to go, amazing things to do in the future.</p>\n<p>But right now, can\u2019t she just be happy?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things have escalated very quickly.</p>\n<p>Everything had been under control, for a while. There were rules, however unspoken, and Lena could compartmentalize her life \u2013 more specifically, her relationship with Kara - into two distinct sections that must never touch. Now they\u2019re definitely touching, and Lena doesn\u2019t know how to make it stop.</p>\n<p>It all started going downhill when that stupid pube-bearded gym substitute showed up.</p>\n<p>Lena isn\u2019t jealous. She\u2019s <em>not</em>. There\u2019s no reason for her to be \u2013 she and Kara aren\u2019t dating, and Kara doesn\u2019t seem interested in the guy anyways. But every time he put his hand on her lower back with that smarmy smile it made something deep and unpleasant crawl up her spine, and in some kind of fit of insanity, she invited Kara back to her place. And they <em>spoke</em>. And now, everything is different.</p>\n<p>Now, they\u2019re talking during their trysts. They sometimes even cuddle afterwards, and every so often, it\u2019s Kara who texts Lena asking to come over. They still haven\u2019t defined anything, haven\u2019t made any attempt to clarify things, but nevertheless their arrangement is starting to leech into other parts of Lena\u2019s life like water crawling its way up a piece of fabric.</p>\n<p>Like now. Kara had been so excited to suggest a class field trip to the Smithsonian, and in her defense, the kids are loving it \u2013 but as soon as the planning gets underway Lena is transported back to that night in January, when she kept herself up until the early hours in fear of what her sleeping body might do and then, lo and behold, she woke up to Kara jarring her in her attempt to extract herself from the sloth-like cuddle Lena trapped her in.</p>\n<p>Now that they\u2019re actually sleeping together, her self-control is even worse.</p>\n<p>They get separate rooms this time, at least. There\u2019s no clerical mistake, and their rooms are across the hall from each other, with a few rooms between theirs and the students. But even with their separate rooms Lena ends up in Kara\u2019s anyways, ass in the air and face pressed into the pillows to muffle her moans.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dangerous, to do this when the kids they\u2019re chaperoning are in rooms just down the hall. It\u2019s unprofessional and very, very risky. But Kara looked incredible in her fitted black top and pants today, her hair in a crisp bun as she guided their group around the Air and Space Museum, and Lena has been thinking about unraveling it since they stepped off the bus this morning.</p>\n<p>Kneeled behind Lena with her hair half-out of its bun and most of her clothes tangled in the hotel sheets, her fingers driving in with devastating precision until Lena has to bite the pillow as she comes, Kara certainly looks unraveled.</p>\n<p>She also seems determined not to stop until Lena has properly forgotten all the reasons this was a bad idea. When Kara finally collapses beside her, breathing hard, Lena stretches out on her belly and feels every muscle and joint in her lower body stretch and pop in a way that\u2019s almost as satisfying as the multiple orgasms.</p>\n<p>Despite having been inside her not 30 seconds ago, Kara\u2019s eyes still track the slow movement over Lena\u2019s body as she stretches with interest, her own abs still flexing with exertion on every exhale.</p>\n<p>Lena snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot <em>possibly</em> want to go again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith you? Pretty much always,\u201d Kara replies easily, and the raw honestly hiding behind the joking statement makes Lena\u2019s breath catch. Suddenly, eye contact with Kara seems unspeakably intimate.</p>\n<p>Instead she flips over, looking up at the ceiling and focusing on how her body feels \u2013 still buzzing with the aftereffects of 4 orgasms, her fingers and thigh sticky with Kara\u2019s release. She lets herself feel content for a few moments with Kara\u2019s comforting presence next to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena?\u201d</p>\n<p>The contentment starts to drain away at the hesitant tone in Kara\u2019s voice. She\u2019s clearly about to ask something important. Something that Lena would prefer not to talk about at all, let alone in a hotel room where they have to whisper because their students are down the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Lena hums, trying to sound noncommittal.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this \u2013 are we\u2026are you good?\u201d</p>\n<p>The question is strangely worded enough that Lena tears her eyes away from the plaster swirls on the roof to look at Kara quizzically.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara clears her throat, reaching up to where her glasses usually sit and looking flustered when they aren\u2019t there for her to fiddle with. Her hand goes instead to Lena\u2019s stomach, using a soft fingertip to play connect-the-dots with the smattering of freckles and moles across her torso.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean \u2013 what we\u2019re doing. Are you\u2026okay with it?\u201d Kara finally clarifies, and Lena shifts with sudden unease. Kara\u2019s hand stops immediately, interpreting her movement as discomfort, and Lena finds herself missing the contact.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been existing in a way that works, however strangely. Sure, she might have cried during sex a few weeks ago, but that was an anomaly. A complete outlier, borne of having a bad day and <em>nothing else</em>. Why do they have to <em>talk</em> about it?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Lena edges, and Kara\u2019s answer shifts her perspective slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2026I want to make sure you\u2019re happy. With all of this, with how we\u2026do this. We haven\u2019t really talked about it \u2013 and that\u2019s fine! But you deserve to be happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s throat feels thick. Kara, ever-considerate Kara, wants to make sure that <em>Lena</em> is happy. Lena has been blatantly using her for months, calling her whenever the craving for Kara\u2019s touch gets too strong and then refusing to acknowledge it even in private, and Kara is worried about whether Lena is <em>happy</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Lena says, the lie feeling sticky in her throat. Kara nods, but the bright smile Lena is used to seeing seems a little dim.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, good! Me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>After the strange, stilted, but definitely open acknowledgement that they are in fact in some sort of entanglement, the floodgates seem to open and their old rules are forgotten at an alarming rate.</p>\n<p>First, Kara pecks her on the lips as she\u2019s leaving Lena\u2019s apartment in the early morning, a gesture of affection that Lena thinks about for days afterwards. It leads to more casual kisses, until Lena has to forcefully stop herself from kissing Kara between classes at work.</p>\n<p>The next to be abandoned is the sleeping-over rule. For the duration of their relationship thus far, Lena considered sleeping over to be possibly the highest on the list of things <em>not</em> to do \u2013 but, when Kara falls asleep in her bed after a particularly intense night, Lena doesn\u2019t wake her up. Instead she curls into her side, letting herself enjoy the warmth (just for one night). And, afterwards, it becomes a habit. Over the course of a few weeks, Lena becomes almost as familiar with waking up in Kara\u2019s bed as she is with her own.</p>\n<p>And then, of course, staying over means Lena accumulating a few necessary things at Kara\u2019s house \u2013 a toothbrush, a change of clothes, a phone charger (who uses android?). Kara\u2019s favourite CDs somehow end up in Lena\u2019s car, and they now eat together so often that Alex starts squinting at them with suspicion in her eyes when Kara picks a cherry tomato from Lena\u2019s salad in the work lunchroom, eating it willingly, and Lena doesn\u2019t even glance up from her book. It\u2019s a gradual climb, a slow boil into a kind of simple intimacy that Lena would have run screaming from a few months ago.</p>\n<p>She might run screaming still.</p>\n<p>Especially when, in April, one of her planning sessions with Kara is interrupted by her phone lighting up with a familiar contact number. She excuses herself and steps into the hallway, steeling herself as she answers the call.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her brother\u2019s greeting is always the same, and Lena tries to temper the affection that follows it almost automatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cLex. To what do I owe the pleasure? Has it already been 6 months since you told me I was wasting my potential?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lex sighs, and Lena can tell he was hoping for a friendlier greeting. \u201cYou know I have to keep trying to change your mind. You\u2019re not meant to be a high school teacher, Lena.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>like</em> being a high school teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou also like actually applying your genius,\u201d Lex says, and Lena can\u2019t deny the truth of it. \u201cMom will never admit it, but you\u2019re smarter than me. You know you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known that,\u201d Lena says, her irritation softening, and Lex laughs before he takes on a more serious tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you remember that research you did when you interned here in grad school?\u201d he asks, and Lena thinks back. \u201cOn nanotechnology?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. My project with Jack.\u201d Jack had been a great partner \u2013 charismatic and smart, and ridiculously good at programming. Lena had always felt like their work went unfinished, but her internship had ended, and soon after that she got her job here.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dug it out again a few months ago,\u201d Lex says, and Lena can hear the pride in his voice. Not for himself, but for her. \u201cIt turns out you were just a few steps away from a breakthrough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026what?\u201d Lena whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe used your research to make a major step in cancer treatment, Lena. Even when you\u2019re not here, you\u2019re making an impact. Imagine what you could do if you <em>were</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena is stunned.</p>\n<p>Her research. <em>Her research</em> was used to do something truly incredible. She left the family business to feel like she had her own life, some kind of control, and she got it in this job where she feels like she makes a small difference in the lives of her students \u2013 but that need to <em>help</em> never left her. She knows, without a doubt, that she\u2019s the most competent scientist that LuthorCorp could possibly hire, and the knowledge sits heavy in her gut.</p>\n<p>She could <em>help</em>. She could change, make a difference, make an imprint on the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I know you didn\u2019t want to answer to me, or to mom,\u201d Lex continues, sensing her hesitation. \u201cBut mom is taking a step back to focus on other things, and if you come work with me, I want you to be my CFO.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena reels back a little at that. This is, by far, the most that Lex has ever offered her. Usually he calls to tell her to take on R&amp;D jobs, to work in the lab where the science happens, but CFO? Second in command, with most of the powers that Lex himself has? She could steer the company in new directions.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to make a move, make a new branch in National City. You wouldn\u2019t even have to relocate, or work with me. You could oversee it, and then run it,\u201d Lex says, and his voice gets a little quieter. \u201cAnd besides, I don\u2019t want to keep doing this forever. I want to be able to pass the company down to someone I can trust, someday soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena shakes her head, not fully believing what he tells her. \u201cThis is insane. You\u2019re handing me a Fortune 500 company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know you can do it as well as I do. Better, even.\u201d</p>\n<p>She knows he\u2019s right. But, it would mean leaving here, where she\u2019s been so happy. It would mean work would become her life. It would mean less time for the blonde woman waiting for her in her classroom.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s never seen a CEO with a healthy relationship. Lex himself is one of the loneliest people she knows, even if he won\u2019t admit it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she says finally, and Lex lets her go with that promise.</p>\n<p>When she steps back into the classroom Kara is in the middle of an air guitar solo, singing along to the tiny radio she keeps in her office in an adorably goofy moment of imagination, and she grins at Lena\u2019s arched brow. Affection rolls through Lena, tinged with apprehension from the phone conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Kara says, dropping her air guitar. \u201cAnything important?\u201d</p>\n<p>After a pause, Lena shakes her head and sits back down, putting her socked feet back in Kara\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lie stays in the back of her head for days afterwards.</p>\n<p>The Mathletes finals creep up unexpectedly fast. After Lex\u2019s offer, it feels like the end of the year is rushing up to meet her far too quickly, and all Lena wants is more time. More time with Kara, more time to savour what might end up being her last year being a teacher. More time to make her decision.</p>\n<p>The competition is in National City this year, so the trip is at least not an overnight one. They just need to bus the students to and from the conference centre in the city, and manage to get lunch for everyone. Lena feels almost as nervous as the team, sitting in the first row next to Kara \u2013 while their students solve equations and word problems, she squeezes Kara\u2019s hand in a death grip, cheering them on under her breath.</p>\n<p>The score is tied up by the last round, and Lena is pretty sure she and Kara have both lost all circulation to their hands. The question the announcer puts up on the projector is a trick one \u2013 the answer is almost a riddle, and she can see the students on both sides struggling with it. When the team from Star City hits their buzzer, she can hear Kara hold her breath.</p>\n<p>But, they\u2019re <em>wrong</em>. The opposing team says the wrong answer, and it\u2019s all Lena can do not to yell the right one out \u2013 but she trusts the kids, trusts that she and Kara taught them enough to figure it out.</p>\n<p>When Eve Tessmacher tentatively hits her buzzer and says the correct answer in a shaky voice, and the announcer claps his hands and says that they have a winner, Lena is up and out of her seat in a heartbeat. Kara is next to her, jumping up and down and whistling, and she herself is yelling, and the students are all stampeding off the stage to meet them in a big group hug.</p>\n<p>They probably look absolutely ridiculous, making such a fuss about a trophy for a high school math competition, but she doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>Eve is the hero of the day on the bus ride home. They all recount those final moments a hundred times, Kara dramatizing the story with sound effects, and finally, with a bright red face, Eve admits that she did a pretty good job.</p>\n<p>The arrival back at the school feels almost like deja-vu. The students get into their parents cars, the bus drives away, and she and Kara are left standing together in the parking lot, a big plastic trophy between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can put this up next week. Yeah?\u201d Kara says, holding the trophy up, and Lena\u2019s body reacts viscerally to the reminder of what happened last time. Their heated kiss, Lena running away, driving off in separate cars and trying not to take care of the problem herself. This time, she\u2019s free to go home with Kara. In fact, she has to, because she drove in with her this morning.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something shocking in that revelation.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s alarming that she never considered it before, but \u2013 she and Kara <em>carpooled</em>. Her car is at Kara\u2019s, parked in the driveway. She spent the night last night and they got dressed together this morning and she brushed her teeth in Kara\u2019s bathroom and drank coffee in Kara\u2019s kitchen, and they drove to work together. Like a couple.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost more startling that the idea makes her sort of\u2026happy.</p>\n<p>As if she can sense Lena\u2019s thoughts, Kara grins and holds out a hand, nodding her head towards her car on the other side of the lot. With almost no hesitation, Lena takes it.</p>\n<p>Lena has never experienced this many different kinds of sex with a single person. When they first came together, it was fast and frantic \u2013 a venting of steam, ripping of clothes and hard, fast rhythms that sated her shameful cravings. And it\u2019s still like that, sometimes \u2013 there are still days when they\u2019re so desperate for each other that Lena\u2019s shaky hands rip the buttons of Kara\u2019s shirts, when they can\u2019t even take the time to get fully naked before they\u2019re inside each other.</p>\n<p>But slowly, something else developed. Now there are days when it\u2019s soft, and slow, where their couplings almost line up with how Lena thought sex with Kara Danvers would be. Where Kara unravels her so carefully and with such reverence that she feels like something precious. Where she can take full, luxurious minutes to run her lips and tongue over every inch of Kara\u2019s taut stomach, her inner thighs, every fold and ridge of her centre.</p>\n<p>And now, a new evolution.</p>\n<p>Their kisses start as soon as they\u2019ve unlocked Kara\u2019s door, but they\u2019re soft and easy, unpressured. Full of smiles, of playful nips and breathless laughter. Kara tickles her slightly when she pulls off Lena\u2019s shirt, and Lena pokes at her stomach in retaliation. Kara gets tangled in her own pants, and instead of just waiting for her to <em>get over to the bed already</em>, Lena laughs at her, and throws a pair of balled-up socks at her torso.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet over here, doofus,\u201d Lena grins, and Kara wiggles and hops until she can flop on the bed, giggling. Lena detangles her, removing the pants with a look that reads<em> \u2018was that so hard?\u2019,</em> and Kara grins and strokes the side of her face affectionately as Lena kisses down her stomach.</p>\n<p>It all feels easy, and light, nothing like the heaviness that Lena always associated with sex before this. It\u2019s <em>fun</em> - even when, in the process of coming, Kara digs her heel into Lena\u2019s back in a way that makes her grunt in discomfort. She smacks Kara\u2019s thigh, grinning despite the cramp.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jesus</em>, Kara! This is sex, not a shiatsu massage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was really into it! I can\u2019t help that you make me come so hard,\u201d Kara fires back, and Lena blushes as she brushes her off.</p>\n<p>\u201cWeirdo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s answer is to pull Lena back up and flip them both, easing herself down between Lena\u2019s thighs and wiggling her eyebrows suggestively.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena has never laughed during sex. Sex is serious, an occasional indulgence to release tension. Joking while Kara\u2019s mouth is on her clit is something she never would have considered possible. Something she never thought she\u2019d be comfortable enough to do with anyone.</p>\n<p>But, here they are. The feeling that sparks in her when Kara nips playfully at her inner thigh, grinning up as she licks teasingly, is something else entirely.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s something she\u2019s never felt before.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s still recovering from her second orgasm when Kara pops her head back up, wiping at her mouth and chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>never</em> going to get tired of doing that,\u201d Kara says dreamily, almost to herself, as she slips her fingers into her mouth with a satisfied noise.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019ll never get tired of it, either.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The thought is startling, but the more she thinks about it, the truer it seems. The idea that, if she were to keep sleeping with Kara for the rest of her life, she\u2019d be perfectly happy. She\u2019d even be happy just spending time together, waking up together, falling asleep in her arms.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, god. </em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just casual, anymore. Lena might be out of touch with her feelings, but she\u2019s not an idiot.</p>\n<p>This brand-new knowledge sits heavy in her chest as Kara flops down next to her, pulling her close and kissing her jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, you know that?\u201d Kara mumbles into her hair, already dozing, and Lena wants to squirm away from the praise. But with Kara warm and heavy next to her, sleep overtakes her alarmingly quickly, overriding her anxious brain.</p>\n<p>Her last thought before succumbing is one she\u2019s been tossing around for a while, but seems especially apt now.</p>\n<p>\n<em>She deserves more than what I can give her. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>May comes and goes in a whirlwind of days and nights spent tangled with Kara in one way or another, trying desperately to distance herself from the growing knowledge that she\u2019s in too deep, and before Lena knows it, it\u2019s prom season.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a time that, in previous years, Lena hardly thought about at all. It\u2019s always sad that the year is inching closer to its end and she\u2019s going to have to say goodbye to some of her favourite senior students as they go off to college, but prom itself isn\u2019t a factor in her life.</p>\n<p>But, of course, it\u2019s a factor in Kara\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you chaperoning prom this year?\u201d Kara asks absent-mindedly, naked and sweaty in Lena\u2019s bed for the fourth time in a week. Lena stops abruptly in her attempt to trace her own name in looping cursive over Kara\u2019s abs with a fingernail.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I <em>ever</em> chaperoned prom?\u201d Lena snorts, and she feels Kara\u2019s chest rumble with a laugh. \u201cIt sounds like a nightmare. I didn\u2019t even go to my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d Kara asks, almost dislodging Lena completely when she props herself up on her elbows. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI graduated high school when I was 15. I was finished college and on to grad school before I was 20. I didn\u2019t exactly have time,\u201d Lena says drily, and Kara squints down at her. Lena isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s because she\u2019s concerned, or just because she isn\u2019t wearing her glasses. Either way, it\u2019s cute.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026you were 15?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was turning 16,\u201d Lena counters. Kara just shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>have</em> to go to prom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, unless you have a time machine\u2026\u201d Lena drawls, but Kara won\u2019t be deterred.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome chaperone with me! It\u2019ll be fun, we can dance and drink spiked punch and get a hotel room and everything. The whole experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d let them spike the punch?\u201d Lena asks, still trying to fully process what Kara is asking. \u201cIsn\u2019t the point of a chaperone to stop that sort of thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd ruin their good time? As long as they don\u2019t hurt anyone, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm,\u201d Kara says with a wave. Lena laughs quietly. Typical Kara \u2013 she\u2019s still the exact same woman she was all those years ago when she comforted a panic-ridden Lena on her first day. The one who couldn\u2019t imagine telling on the janitor for forgetting to turn off the air conditioning, in case they got in trouble. The thought fills her with affection.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, a hotel room?\u201d Lena says, watching Kara get more and more excited about the idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! It\u2019s a thing, you know. Everyone wants to lose their virginity in a nice hotel room at prom,\u201d Kara says with a wink, and Lena gasps, poking her in the chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, Kara, please tell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kara says, giggling and batting her hand away. \u201cNo, I was a lot older when I\u2026you know. Not until college.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you want to\u2026what, recreate the experience?\u201d Lena says doubtfully, but Kara doesn\u2019t seem at all affected by her skepticism.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could be fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena wants to say no. She <em>means</em> to say no. But the puppy-dog eyes of Kara Danvers are impossible to resist, and like clockwork three days later she\u2019s dress shopping while Kara texts her their hotel reservation.</p>\n<p>So much for that Luthor spine of steel.</p>\n<p>She feels unnecessarily nervous, getting herself ready for a dance she didn\u2019t really want to go to in the first place. The dress she bought isn\u2019t formal \u2013 it\u2019s black, and it shows a lot more shoulder than her regular work dresses, but she made sure to avoid looking like she\u2019s trying too hard \u2013 and she\u2019s going simple with her hairdo, but when Kara rings her doorbell just as she\u2019s finishing up her makeup, she can\u2019t help the butterflies in her stomach.</p>\n<p>The butterflies become a swarm when she opens the door.</p>\n<p>Firstly, Kara is in a tailored suit. The fabric is deep red, with a crisp white shirt and a matching tie, and it\u2019s tight on every part of her body all the way to her polished dress shoes. Her hair is down in perfect waves, and her face is bare and handsome. She\u2019s wearing lip balm and nothing else, and Lena wants to mix it with her own lipstick.</p>\n<p>The effect is devastating. But Lena is gratified, at least, that she seems to be having the same impact on Kara. Her eyes haven\u2019t left Lena\u2019s chest since the door opened, and it takes Lena clearing her throat for the line of sight to break.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look\u2026<em>wow</em>. You look incredible, Lena,\u201d Kara says, her voice hushed. A blush colours her cheeks, as if she realizes exactly how affected she sounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Lena manages to say, and she\u2019s proud of how she kept the squeak out of her voice that usually accompanies feeling this breathless.</p>\n<p>Kara is moving nervously from foot to foot, and she\u2019s holding her hands behind her back in a curious way. When Lena tries to look around to see what it is, she shifts with a grin. \u201cNo peeking!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, come inside and show me what it is, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara steps in, twisting so that Lena can\u2019t see the surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, honestly, whatever it is, just <em>show</em> me \u2013\u201c Lena huffs, and with a roll of her eyes Kara finally thrusts the thing forwards.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a tiny flower arrangement \u2013 in deep red, just like Kara\u2019s suit \u2013 attached to a bracelet.</p>\n<p>A corsage.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know this isn\u2019t exactly the same \u2013 you can\u2019t dance with all your friends or get wasted at the afterparty. But I wanted to try to make up for you missing prom,\u201d Kara says, and her hands shake almost imperceptibly as she offers the tiny gift with so much meaning.</p>\n<p>Against her will, Lena\u2019s eyes start to water. She swallows hard against them, willing them not to ruin her makeup, and takes the offering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s perfect,\u201d she manages to say, her voice cracking only the slightest bit. \u201cThank you, Kara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, let me \u2013\u201c Kara gently slips the bracelet over her wrist until it fits snugly, and then her hands rest with Lena\u2019s, playing with her fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it,\u201d Kara whispers, and all the hopeless love Lena has ever had for her rushes forward, and she does the only thing she can do to deflect \u2013 she leans up on her toes, and kisses her. She can feel Kara smile into the kiss, and when Lena pulls away, her gloss has a crimson tint.</p>\n<p>She swipes her thumb across Kara\u2019s lower lip, wiping at the stain and reveling in the way Kara\u2019s eyes widen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, hm? We have a dance to get to.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dance itself is exactly what Lena thought it would be. A huge hall full of teenagers getting rowdy, drinking punch that definitely has at least a 12 ounce bottle of smuggled rum in it, and dancing borderline inappropriately. But Kara is there, in <em>that suit</em>, being her usual self and dancing like a goof just to make her laugh, and against her better judgement she\u2019s actually having a good time by the end.</p>\n<p>The whole thing is starting to wind down when Kara throws her a wild card.</p>\n<p>Something soft and slow comes on the speakers, and as the students start to pair off, Kara holds out a hand. Lena looks down at it, brow arched, and Kara laughs, her palm still outstretched.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p>\n<p>A spike of fear pulses through her, almost instinctively. Kara wants to dance, <em>here</em>, in front of \u00bc of the student body and several of their coworkers. It\u2019s a terrible idea.</p>\n<p>But when she takes a surreptitious glance around, they aren\u2019t the only teachers having fun. Winn is being spun by James in the middle of the dance floor to the students\u2019 delight, and Alex is off in a corner swaying and laughing with a woman Lena recognizes as Ruby Arias\u2019 mother.</p>\n<p>Briefly, she wonders why Ms. Arias is chaperoning, when her daughter is only a freshman.</p>\n<p>But, there are more important things to consider \u2013 such as, Kara with one foot on the dance floor and a hand outstretched.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine. Nobody will suspect anything if they have a normal, friendly dance. And, she has to admit, she wouldn\u2019t hate being held in Kara\u2019s arms in that tight suit she\u2019s wearing. So, she lets Kara pull her onto the dance floor. Despite keeping a respectable distance between their bodies, Lena still feels a flare of heat where Kara\u2019s hand rests on her waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to be my prom date,\u201d Kara whispers cheekily.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh!\u201d Lena hisses, glancing around, but she can\u2019t hide her smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you having a good time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprisingly, yes,\u201d Lena admits, adjusting her grip on Kara\u2019s hand so it doesn\u2019t look quite so intimate. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown me the benefits of school dances. They aren\u2019t <em>all</em> bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara laughs, and slowly Lena starts to forget about everyone who could be watching. The song reaches a crescendo, and she\u2019s getting lost in Kara\u2019s eyes, and god <em>damn</em> it if she doesn\u2019t feel like the 17-year-old infatuated girl at prom that she never got to be.</p>\n<p>She is in <em>so</em> deep.</p>\n<p>And when the dance is finally over, the decorations cleaned up and the students all shuttled off to their afterparties, Kara pulls a hotel keycard out of her wallet.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing fancy, the place Kara brings her to. It\u2019s a basic, moderate Marriott on the other side of town, booked in the hopes that they won\u2019t run into any students \u2013 but there\u2019s champagne waiting for them when Lena opens the door to their room and Kara grins, expertly popping the cork and pouring them foaming glasses.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re empty, Lena feeling a little more relaxed, Kara takes the flute from her hand gently and sets them both on the table next to the open bottle.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kara whispers with a wink as she pulls Lena closer by the hips. \u201c\u2019I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, shut <em>up</em>, you dork \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>But, true to her word, it <em>is</em> gentle. It\u2019s gentle, and slow, and heartfelt. Every second of it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost alarming, how quickly and easily she melts into Kara. The second their lips touch, her response is almost Pavlovian \u2013 she feels hot and alive and ready, already pushing Kara\u2019s jacket from her shoulders and running her hands over the soft fabric of her shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s impatient,\u201d Kara murmurs, and the low timbre of her voice makes Lena shiver. And, to her embarrassment, Kara <em>definitely</em> feels it. She grins into the kiss, sliding her hands over Lena\u2019s dress and toying with the zipper between her shoulderblades.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being a tease,\u201d Lena says with a raised brow, fumbling with Kara\u2019s buttons as the blonde just grins at her knowingly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it <em>my</em> prom night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara concedes the point begrudgingly.</p>\n<p>She slips out of her suit quickly after that. Lena is almost relieved, until Kara decides to spend whole decadent minutes getting Lena\u2019s dress off, unhooking her bra, teasing her over her underwear. True to form she guides Lena to the edge and keeps her there, answering Lena\u2019s pleas for relief with hushed assurances that she\u2019ll get there. <em>Just be patient.</em></p>\n<p>And, as she\u2019s been doing for months even when she couldn\u2019t admit it, Lena gives herself over with no hesitation.</p>\n<p>Kara is true to her word, finally pushing Lena over into an orgasm that makes her body arch fully off the bed, and despite her best efforts she can\u2019t stop a few tears from spilling over at the reverence on Kara\u2019s face as she guides her through. Lena manages to turn the tables once, or twice, encouraging Kara to ride her thigh or let her slip her fingers between them, but soon enough the blonde\u2019s attention is fully focused on her again.</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>When Kara finally stops for a break, grabbing them both a glass of water, Lena is pretty sure her voice is already hoarse. She drains the water in a few seconds, suddenly realizing how parched she is.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Lena rasps as Kara takes the empty glass back, setting it on the bedside table next to the bottle of champagne. After a moment of consideration, Kara grabs the bottle and takes a swig from it, grinning as the bubbles tickle her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant some?\u201d Kara asks, holding it out to Lena, and Lena has a moment of intense self-awareness. She\u2019s spread out in bed in a mid-range hotel room, naked and half-sated next to a gorgeous woman, drinking champagne directly out of the bottle after prom. If her mother could see her now, so uncaring of everything she was told to value growing up, she\u2019d have a heart attack.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s with a savage sort of satisfaction that Lena accepts the bottle and takes a long, happy drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, I knew you knew how to have fun,\u201d Kara winks, taking the champagne back. Lena pokes at her shoulder in offense, making her choke a little on the mouthful as she laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat made you think I <em>didn\u2019t</em>?\u201d Lena challenges, and Kara snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding? Miss \u201cI hate holidays, I didn\u2019t go to my own prom, no Kara you can\u2019t do that experiment \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI stop you from blowing your lab up <em>one time</em> and you think I\u2019m the fun police,\u201c Lena grumbles.</p>\n<p>Kara laughs, nudging her with a shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you come off as very\u2026serious. I\u2019m glad I know you better than that, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The reminder that Kara <em>knows</em> her, probably better than anyone in the world besides Jess, makes Lena\u2019s breath catch in her throat. Unsure how to change the subject, Lena grabs the bottle back from Kara and takes another long drink, and before Kara can keep talking, she silences her with a kiss.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the conversation gets lighter after that. They pass the bottle back and forth, laughing and trading kisses between, until it\u2019s over half empty and Kara sets it back on the bedside table. She stands up again, and while Lena misses her warmth, she can\u2019t deny that she\u2019s enjoying the visual of Kara in all her glory in the glow of the lamps.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I almost forgot! Speaking of <em>fun</em>,\u201d Kara says, leaning down to grab her duffel bag from the floor and rooting through it.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I be worried?\u201d Lena asks, propping herself up on an elbow, and Kara\u2019s response is to pull something out of the bag with a grin \u2013 something intimately familiar now, a mess of black straps and blue silicone that makes Lena\u2019s heart rate kick up a notch.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Lena breathes, as Kara steps into the harness and starts to buckle. \u201cThis is <em>much</em> better than high school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara is laughing when she crawls onto the bed, and Lena hooks a leg around her waist to pull her closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should hope this is better than high school, <em>Miss Luthor</em>,\u201d Kara teases, dragging the silicone against Lena\u2019s centre, and Lena\u2019s hips jump as she grabs a fistful of blonde hair, pulling her close enough to kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up and fuck me, Danvers.\u201d</p>\n<p>For all her teasing, Kara knows when to follow a command. It\u2019s only a few minutes later that Lena is communicating only in high-pitched whines, her body winding tighter and tighter under Kara\u2019s attention. The hotel bed has a solid headboard, no convenient slats for her to grab while Kara fucks her, and in her desperation for something to wrap her hands around, she ends up grasping at the bedside table.</p>\n<p>Of course, she forgot about the bottle they left there.</p>\n<p>She can see it rocking back and forth at the same rate as her body. She knows, intellectually, that she should let go. But her hand doesn\u2019t seem to be listening to her brain, and before she can relinquish her hold, the champagne tips, hitting the table and splashing over the wood. The movement of it, in time with their hips, means that more gushes out with every thrust, and it spills all over the sheets and splashes onto Lena\u2019s torso and Kara\u2019s back but neither of them is stopping \u2013 Kara just lifts Lena\u2019s legs up to wrap around her waist, and goes harder.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something painfully erotic about it. Kara doesn\u2019t seem to care that she\u2019s covered in spilled champagne \u2013 she just licks it off of Lena\u2019s chest, lets it drip down her neck and dampen her hair. Their kisses taste like it, and Lena smells champagne and sweat and Kara as the blonde murmurs encouragements in her ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good, you\u2019re so <em>beautiful</em>, I want you to come <em>so</em> badly, baby, I want \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>But Lena is already coming, her toes curling over Kara\u2019s back as her brain echoes with Kara\u2019s voice calling her <em>baby</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s indescribable. Kara has always made her come harder than anyone else, but somehow the affectionate pet name that she\u2019d always told herself she hated paired with the praise and the overall feeling of <em>closeness</em> washes over Lena like a tsunami, lighting up every nerve ending until she\u2019d clinging to Kara\u2019s strong shoulders for dear life.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, Kara,\u201d she gasps, trying to catch her breath as Kara\u2019s hips slow down to a gentle rocking motion. \u201c<em>Fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you take more?\u201d Kara asks breathlessly, almost desperately, and Lena still marvels at the way her body fires back up at such a simple question.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she breathes into Kara\u2019s mouth, and Kara\u2019s grin lights up Lena\u2019s chest almost as much as it does her lower body.</p>\n<p>Determined to distract herself from the dangerously powerful feelings Kara is evoking, Lena pushes herself up on shaky arms until Kara is upright and she\u2019s straddling her lap, the toy still inside her - and slowly, <em>slowly,</em> she starts to ride.</p>\n<p>In the end, the move just makes it <em>worse</em>.</p>\n<p>From this position, all Lena has to focus on is Kara. A droplet of champagne slides slowly down Kara\u2019s temple, and Lena can see the microscopic bubbles in it and every fleck of hazel and grey in Kara\u2019s blue eyes, trained so intently on her face. Her hair is messy and one side is a little wet, and Lena\u2019s lipstick is smeared across Kara\u2019s bow lips. She\u2019s sweaty and focused, completely absorbed in the moment, and she\u2019s never been more beautiful.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unhurried, the pace they set together. It\u2019s not the frantic, desperate rhythm she usually sets with this toy, or even the more relaxed but still passionate one from just a few minutes ago. This speed is languid, almost decadent \u2013 the toy shifts inside her so slowly that she can feel every slick inch of it stretching her open at this new angle, and Kara\u2019s hands are solid on her hip and the centre of her back, splayed out in a hold that\u2019s both steadying and possessive. She has no idea how Kara is holding them both up \u2013 thighs of steel and absolutely spectacular core strength, clearly, Lena thinks with a shiver \u2013 but Kara hardly seems to notice the weight.</p>\n<p>The eye contact is too much, all of a sudden.</p>\n<p>Lena closes her eyes instead, tipping her head back and trying to focus on her body. The stretch and pressure, the slide of their sweaty skin together, the hardness of Kara\u2019s stomach against her own softer one, Kara\u2019s lips and teeth dragging over her chest and up to her throat. It all feels good, excruciatingly good, and she can feel herself getting close surprisingly quickly considering the slowness.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love this freckle,\u201d Kara whispers, biting down on the middle of Lena\u2019s throat, and she feels herself clench around the length inside her at the mixture of pain and pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013\u201c Lena gasps, twitching again when Kara bites harder. She\u2019s choking on something, a very specific and forbidden phrase that wants to escape, and she has to bite down hard on her lip to keep herself from saying it.</p>\n<p>She <em>can\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>But it isn\u2019t the physical sensations that make her come, in the end. When she finally tips over the edge, it\u2019s Kara\u2019s voice in her ear that makes the difference, and as she comes down from the high of her fifth orgasm, she knows. As hard as she\u2019s tried to ignore them, she <em>knows</em> in her heart that these feelings aren\u2019t going away. They\u2019re getting stronger every day, with every little thing Kara does. With every soft touch of lips along her jaw, every slow thrust, every moment of heart-stopping eye contact.</p>\n<p>She needs to cut this off.</p>\n<p>Kara can\u2019t get too attached to her, not with her future. Kara deserves better, a normal life, kids and a dog and a partner who isn\u2019t going to be working 100-hour weeks for the foreseeable future. Someone who isn\u2019t emotionally scarred, liable to run at the slightest provocation. Someone who can give her what she needs.</p>\n<p>Someone who isn\u2019t Lena.</p>\n<p>Finally exhausted, Kara flops back onto the sheets, her sweaty chest heaving with exertion, and immediately Lena dismounts and rolls until her head is pillowed there. She doesn\u2019t care that every heavy breath almost dislodges her head \u2013 something in her is screaming for this closeness, and Kara is her usual perfect self. She wraps an arm around Lena\u2019s shoulder, pulls her in close and tight, and kisses the top of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy prom, Lena,\u201d Kara murmurs into her hair, and Lena squeezes her eyes shut, hoping against hope that this feeling of inevitability will be gone by morning.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t. When Lena opens her eyes a few hours later, it\u2019s to Kara gazing at her like she\u2019s some kind of treasure, followed by an avalanche of guilt.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Kara grins, her voice a little raspy from sleep and the night\u2019s activities, and something unacceptable rises in Lena\u2019s chest to greet it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just going to get us some breakfast. Black coffee and a croissant, right? Maybe some fruit?\u201d</p>\n<p>As Kara grabs for the phone, grinning and golden in the morning light and so <em>painfully</em> handsome, Lena knows with startling clarity that she\u2019s taking the job Lex offered. Within seconds of waking, she\u2019s reminded of what she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt last night.</p>\n<p>This is perfect. Last night, this morning, Kara, <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s perfect\u2026and she can\u2019t have it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m actually not very hungry,\u201d Lena finally says, and Kara puts the phone down with a slight frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, okay. Well, we can go for breakfast later, if you want. Or I can make pancakes at my place,\u201d Kara suggests, and Lena hates how tempting those options are. She\u2019d love nothing more than to do what she\u2019s been doing for months \u2013 put the bad thoughts away, and just enjoy the moment.</p>\n<p>But she can\u2019t. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty good night, huh?\u201d Kara says when she\u2019s settled in bed again, grinning, and Lena smiles sadly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty good night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Now or never.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath, Lena averts her eyes to the ceiling, and speaks her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have this much fun working for LuthorCorp.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara seems to pause, a little confused crinkle between her brows.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuthorCorp?\u201d Kara asks, and Lena swallows the little voice inside her that\u2019s telling her not to do this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to work with my brother. Starting this summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara frowns, propping herself up on an elbow. \u201cBut, you\u2019ll be coming back? In September?\u201d</p>\n<p>And here comes the difficult part.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026no,\u201d Lena says hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026leaving for good. He\u2019s making me CFO.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s met with silence. She isn\u2019t quite brave enough to look Kara in the face, so she can\u2019t see her expression, but she can feel Kara\u2019s eyes boring into the side of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you loved teaching?\u201d Kara asks in a small, hurt voice that Lena can\u2019t help but react to. She reaches out to grab Kara\u2019s hand, pulling it to her chest like a lifeline.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do! But there\u2019s so much I could be <em>doing</em>, there. Not just for a group of students, but for the whole world. My research from grad school was used to treat cancer, Kara. If that was then, can you imagine what I could do in the future?\u201d</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t meant to spill every thought she has on the subject, but it\u2019s the only way she can think of to lessen the pain. Maybe, if she can make Kara understand why this can\u2019t work, <em>maybe</em> \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kara says quietly. She doesn\u2019t sound surprised, really \u2013 she sounds resigned. Like she\u2019d been expecting this, and is only sad that it had to happen so soon. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s amazing, Lena. I\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d Lena admits, not meeting Kara\u2019s eyes. She\u2019s squeezing Kara\u2019s hand so hard that they\u2019re probably both losing circulation. \u201cLeaving\u2026everything. But I think I need to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>She knows she could mention that her new position is still in National City. She\u2019s likely not even going to move apartments, at least for a while. But it feels somehow like she\u2019d be giving Kara false hope. Hope that they could work out, when Lena knows they can\u2019t. They <em>shouldn\u2019t</em>. That Kara can do so much better.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara doesn\u2019t sound happy. She sounds horribly, painfully sad. But behind the sadness there\u2019s acceptance, however begrudging, and it cements her decision. This is for the best. Kara will move on.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, Lena can too. Someday.</p>\n<p>Lena emerges from the bathroom a few minutes later to an empty bed, and even though true to form there was no discussion of the subject, Lena knows in her heart that it\u2019s over, now. Their strange, complicated, <em>wonderful</em> time together is done. Again, she tells herself that this is the right decision. Even as she crawls back into the still-messy bed and pulls Kara\u2019s pillow to her face, trying not to cry.</p>\n<p>She is not successful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s drive home from the hotel seems abnormally long. But, that could be because it\u2019s 8 in the morning and her vision is blurred with tears.</p>\n<p>Lena is leaving.</p>\n<p>She knew this was coming, intellectually. She\u2019s always known Lena was destined for better things. But she didn\u2019t expect it so <em>soon</em>. She was thrown off guard when Lena told her, the high from having such a good night immediately doused by the news, and she\u2019s still reeling. Lena is probably going to end up in Metropolis at L-Corp headquarters, on the other side of the country. She\u2019s probably never going to see her again, outside of reading about her achievements in magazines.</p>\n<p>The thought makes her unbearably sad.</p>\n<p>She probably shouldn\u2019t have left like this, spiriting off while Lena was in the bathroom with zero warning. But she couldn\u2019t deal with lying in that bed, the bed where just a few hours ago she had been so sure that she couldn\u2019t possibly be happier, knowing that it could never happen again. That it\u2019s over. It was too much. And now, she\u2019s driving home and her skin still smells like champagne and Lena\u2019s perfume, and her stupid heart is ripped wide open.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not at all surprised when her instincts take her to Alex\u2019s apartment instead of her own.</p>\n<p>She lets herself in like she always does, and unsurprisingly, Alex is asleep. Kara drops her coat on the couch and flops down on it, intending to try to nap before she wakes up, but when she wiggles into the cushions, there\u2019s something poking into her back.</p>\n<p>Reaching around to pull it out, it turns out to be a bra. Lacy, and revealing, and so very far from what Kara knows to be Alex\u2019s usual style. And, now that she\u2019s paying attention, there\u2019s a dress abandoned on the hallway floor that she knows for certain Alex would never wear.</p>\n<p>It looks familiar, actually.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, no.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAlex?\u201d she calls tentatively, standing up, and from Alex\u2019s bedroom she can hear the <em>thump</em> of something hitting the floor, and the telltale sounds of her sister swearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus shitting <em>fuck</em> \u2013 Kara?\u201d</p>\n<p>Another voice is audible, a softer voice, and Kara\u2019s theory is confirmed even though she can't hear the words being said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em>so sorry</em> \u2013\u201c Kara says, mortified, grabbing her jacket and trying to stuff her arms into it before realizing she has it backwards. \u201cI had no idea \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Alex finally emerges in shorts and a NC Prep Volleyball hoodie, her hair in disarray, and shuts the bedroom door quickly as Kara is still trying to figure her coat out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>hell</em>, Kara?\u201d Alex hisses, crossing her arms grumpily. \"You couldn't call first?\"</p>\n<p>Kara finally gets her coat on, and slowly she backs up towards the front door, snatching her shoes up from the rack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m <em>so</em> sorry, oh god \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you <em>here</em> at 8 in the morning?\u201d Alex asks, following Kara\u2019s whirlwind path, and Kara waves her off as she stuffs her feet back into her shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 nothing, I\u2019ll just go \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Alex says, Kara\u2019s panic seeming to make her soften a little. \u201cJust spit it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara feels her eyes well up, her lip quivering a bit despite her best efforts, and Alex sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lena, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara nods, and Alex puts a hand on her shoulder just as Sam Arias emerges from the hallway, dressed in jeans (where did she get jeans when they came here from a formal dance? Unless, she keeps clothes here?). She looks sleepy, but she\u2019s smiling in a sympathetic way.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go,\u201d she says quietly to both of them. \u201cI need to pick Ruby up from her sleepover in a few hours anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns to Alex, and her smile is immediately more affectionate. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex nods, and they kiss in a way that\u2019s far too familiar for a hookup, and Kara thinks that maybe, Alex has been keeping some things from her too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about that, later,\u201d Kara says as the door closes behind Sam, and Alex rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne crisis at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time Kara finishes explaining everything, this whole crazy year with Lena up until the conversation they had a few hours ago, the sun is fully up and Alex has made them each two cups of strong coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, Kara,\u201d Alex says, rubbing her face. \u201cI had no idea it had gotten so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither did I, really. Until it did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe's leaving,\u201d Kara sighs. \u201cTo be a CFO. I always knew she\u2019d do amazing things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Alex says, and there\u2019s begrudging agreement in her voice. \u201cSo\u2026is there a reason you can\u2019t keep dating her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t dating to begin with,\u201d Kara says tiredly. She swirls the dregs of her coffee in the bottom of her mug, as if the specks of coffee bean will reveal the answers she craves. \u201cIt was casual. We both knew that. And besides, LuthorCorp is in Metropolis. She\u2019s going to have to go halfway across the country.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYikes,\u201d Alex says, grimacing. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to keep teaching, in that classroom, without Lena.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex nods, looking thoughtful. \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime for you to take that science journalism job Clark offered you,\u201d Alex says, and she nudges Kara with a foot when she rolls her eyes. \u201cLook, if staying here is just going to remind you of Lena, maybe now is the time for you to start fresh, You can always come back to teaching if you don\u2019t like it. You know Cat Grant will hire you back in a heartbeat.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the same advice that Alex gave her at the beginning of the year, when she refused to take it because the idea of leaving the school when Lena was still there was ludicrous. Now, it seems like maybe it\u2019s just what she needs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Clark.\u201d</p>\n<p>After prom night, their usual texting stops. Lena doesn\u2019t show up at Kara\u2019s place in the middle of the night even once, and Kara somehow resists the temptation to get in her car and drive to Lena\u2019s apartment herself. By day, they still work together \u2013 their usual back-and-forth is tempered by occasional moments of melancholy, but she\u2019s fairly sure the students don\u2019t notice, as wrapped up in exam prep as they are. But their after-hours relationship is nonexistent. They do their marking separately, and Lena seems to arrive at school so early that Kara doesn\u2019t even get to open the door for her anymore.</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s stuff is still at Kara\u2019s apartment, and she has no idea what to do with all of it. It just sits in a drawer, out of sight but not out of mind, and Kara is caught in an endless cycle, torn between wanting to move on and wanting to go back in time. So, she does the only thing she can think to do.</p>\n<p>She picks up the phone, and she calls her cousin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lena didn\u2019t realize how much she had gotten used to waking up with Kara until it\u2019s no longer an option.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s slept alone for so long \u2013 her whole life, essentially, since she\u2019s never been one to sleep over with her occasional hookups \u2013 that she figured it would be simple to go back to. Sharing a bed with Kara was a mistake to begin with, and things are now back to the way they should be. The way they\u2019ve always been.</p>\n<p>But a week and a half after prom, when she wakes up after yet another night spent tossing and turning to an empty bed and an empty heart, she genuinely wonders if this will ever feel normal again.</p>\n<p>She passes the two boxes of Kara\u2019s belongings that have accumulated at her apartment over the last 5 months \u2013 <em>god, has it really been 5 months?</em> \u2013 and pushes down the predictable wave of melancholy that crashes over her as her eyes brush over a jumble of clothes and movies, CDs, and the fuzzy socks Kara always insisted on wearing because Lena keeps her house too cold. Kara always fell asleep wearing them and then ended up slipping them off during the night when she got too hot, and in the morning, Lena would find them at the foot of the bed or tangled in the blankets, despite her near-everyday warnings that she\u2019d light them all on fire if she found another sock on her floor. Instead, she had taken to waking Kara up by throwing the socks at her face, and Kara would just laugh and pull her back into bed, starting the day with kisses and laughter.</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s heart seizes painfully at the memory, her eyes burning with tears she won\u2019t let fall, and she rubs at the sore spot in her chest forlornly.</p>\n<p>Kara wasn\u2019t her girlfriend. They were never more than friends with benefits, a convenient outlet of sexual frustration and occasional affection. That\u2019s what she\u2019s been telling herself all year. Lena has no right to be so fucking <em>sad</em>. And yet here she is, tearing up like a war widow over a box of everything that she hasn\u2019t had the heart to return yet.</p>\n<p>Well, not <em>everything</em>. There is something Kara left behind that isn\u2019t in the box \u2013 Kara\u2019s NCU sweatshirt, the soft one that she lent Lena back in October for Casual Day. Lena took it home intending to wash and return it, but it was so comfortable and smelled like Kara, and eventually Kara had found it in Lena\u2019s pyjama drawer and told her she could keep it.</p>\n<p>Lena knows she should give it back \u2013 it would make it easier to let go if she gets rid of everything \u2013 but instead she shrugs off her shoulders as she chooses her outfit for the day, laying it carefully on her pillow.</p>\n<p>Sleeping in her ex\u2026<em>something\u2019s</em> sweater when she was the one who chose to break it off is pitiful, she knows, but it\u2019s the only thing that brings her any comfort lately.</p>\n<p>School is hell, for Lena. Day in and day out she has to spend over an hour in a room with Kara pretending the very sight of her, her strong shoulders under those button-ups and her deft hands and her sweet, bright eyes and that smile that makes her melt, doesn\u2019t make her want to abandon her plans and just tell Kara how she feels. And it\u2019s made worse by the way she can tell Kara is staring back when Lena isn\u2019t looking \u2013 that puppydog gaze, the clear indication that Lena\u2019s feelings are returned. She\u2019s sure that, if she asked, Kara would date her in a second.</p>\n<p>But she can\u2019t be that selfish. Kara deserves more than she can give.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s what she\u2019s been telling herself for weeks, and it\u2019s starting to ring a little hollow.</p>\n<p>So instead the weeks march on, Lena feeling her lack of sleep more and more every day. It gets to the point that, about two weeks before exams are due to begin, she arrives outside Cat\u2019s office for a science department meeting a full 25 minutes early without realizing, and runs square into Alex Danvers. It\u2019s clear that Alex is waiting too, and their eyes have already locked before she realizes the situation she\u2019s trapped herself in.</p>\n<p>Alex gestures at the seat next to her in the hallway, her expression neutral, and Lena sits gingerly, her back stiff and straight.</p>\n<p>For a few minutes, Lena thinks that maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, Alex doesn\u2019t want to talk either. They sit in silence, only interrupted by occasional classroom noise spilling out as a student or two opens a door to go to the bathroom, and Lena has almost relaxed into her chair when Alex breaks the quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. LuthorCorp, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s back stiffens again the moment Alex speaks, and she swallows thickly. It feels like something is stuck there, heavy with the knowledge that Alex probably knows <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says quietly, and Alex nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Alex replies, and she sounds serious, but genuine. There\u2019s no malice in her tone. Either Alex has magically become fond of Lena overnight, or Kara didn\u2019t make Lena the bad guy.</p>\n<p>Typical Kara, still being perfect even after Lena broke both of their hearts.</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s reply comes out as a hoarse whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blessed silence returns, and Lena could swear that the hands of the clock move in slow motion. She\u2019d do just about anything to be able to politely excuse herself from this situation, and the feeling grows tenfold when Alex speaks up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara\u2019s leaving too, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena can\u2019t help it. Her head jerks towards Alex, her hair whipping her own face in her surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. To work for the Tribune,\u201d Alex says, her nonchalance just a little bit too even to be real. \u201cI guess her cousin had an in for her there as a junior reporter. Science Division.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara had talked about her interest in reporting, before. She minored in journalism, so she told Lena, and she\u2019s always been interested in finding ways to bring science to more people \u2013 it\u2019s why she loves teaching, and being a journalist with a wide platform seemed like a logical step. But Lena hadn\u2019t considered that Kara would ever actually leave the school, where she gets to teach with her sister and make such a difference for the kids.</p>\n<p>Lena clears her throat, trying to sort through her conflicting thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood for her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a good opportunity,\u201d Alex continues, and now her tone is definitely too careful for Lena\u2019s liking. \u201cClark has been telling her to do it for years now \u2013 honestly, I think half the reason it took her so long to leave is because of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The weight that\u2019s been constricting Lena\u2019s chest for this whole conversation slams down to her stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Lena says, knowing how uncontrolled her voice is and <em>hating</em> it. But Alex just nods, unafraid to look Lena in the eye. She doesn\u2019t look angry, really, but Lena can practically see the older woman\u2019s steel spine when it comes to her sister.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in love with you since day one, Luthor. You can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know that. Especially not this year. I\u2019ve seen you two together.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all a little too much. They\u2019re in the middle of an open hallway during work hours, before a meeting with their boss <em>and</em> Kara, and it feels like Alex has just shone a hot spotlight on her. Lena feels too seen, too <em>known</em>, like Alex\u2019s stern words and knowing gaze are flaying her, leaving her open to the knowledge she\u2019s had for months but hasn\u2019t let herself think too hard about, let alone fully admit.</p>\n<p>She and Kara were always more than friends. More than a fling, more than casual.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s in love with Kara Danvers. And Kara loves her, too.</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s mouth opens and closes again, words just not forming from her chaotic thoughts, and Alex continues to carry the conversation by herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s still crazy about you. Even after everything. So much so that she can\u2019t stand being here without you, apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013\u201c Lena starts, her voice cracking uncomfortably. She clears her throat, starting again and willing her own weakness to go back into the box she usually hides it in. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt her. I thought\u2026I could handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex nods, and her understanding is even more confusing than the fact that she seems to want to have this conversation with Lena in the first place. And then, she asks the question Lena has been dreading.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you really leaving?\u201d</p>\n<p>Immediately, Lena spits out the answer she\u2019s been giving to everyone who asks. The easy answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to work for \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>But Alex cuts her off, waving an impatient hand over her half-assed explanation. \u201cNo. Cut the bullshit, Lena. I know you\u2019re leaving for work, to make a difference and what have you. But your brother has been asking you to do this for years, and you only decided to say yes now. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm \u2013\u201c Lena chokes, feeling increasingly claustrophobic in the empty hallway. But Alex looks at her with an expectation tempered by a strange sort of understanding, and Lena finally voices the truth she\u2019s been hiding from everyone but Jess.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex doesn\u2019t look surprised by the admission at all. At her nod, Lena feels even more admissions coming up like word vomit.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this. How to be\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex\u2019s face is as soft as Lena has ever seen it, and Lena suddenly understands why Kara loves her sister so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be in love,\u201d she finally whispers, cursing her eyes for daring to betray her by watering in such a public place.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been in love?\u201d Alex asks, and Lena shakes her head vehemently.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the healthy kind. I can\u2019t do that to Kara, I can\u2019t subject her to whatever kind of twisted relationship I\u2019m capable of. She\u2019s too good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLena,\u201d Alex says, with the kind of patience only a big sister can have, \u201cAs far as I can tell\u2026you\u2019ve been in a relationship all year. And you\u2019ve been in love for longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena swallows, feeling the truth of the words settle in her gut. All those times they added new dimensions to their entanglement, all those times Lena put it out of her head \u2013 Alex is right. She\u2019s been denying it, but she was in too deep before they even kissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd while I\u2019m sure you both messed up at times, she still loves you,\u201d Alex finishes with quiet confidence.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlex\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I can\u2019t tell you what to do. All I wanted to say, was\u2026whatever you choose, I hope it makes you happy. Truly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Lena can try to find an answer to that, the familiar sound of Kara\u2019s heavy footfalls echoes down the hallway as the blonde turns the corner, shoving papers into her messenger bag. She looks up from her work, and when she sees Lena her expression brightens and darkens again in a split second. But Lena sees it, and she feels the same light being forced into dimness in her own chest.</p>\n<p>Maybe she has some things to think about.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every day following prom, Kara truly wishes she was braver.</p>\n<p>The days before the school year ends, and Lena leaves for good, seem to dwindle too fast. Every time she sees Lena she wants to pull her aside, to tell her how she feels and put everything out on the table, but fear stops her every time. Fear of <em>what</em>, she isn\u2019t sure, but it curls in her gut and keeps her from bringing the subject up, no matter how badly she wants to.</p>\n<p>So she lives like this, in this endless cycle of confusion and sadness, for weeks after Lena announced her intention to leave. Kara announces her own departure at a science department meeting with herself, Lena, and Alex, turning the meeting into a session of Cat asking if there was anything she could do to keep both of them, but Lena seems so resolute \u2013 both in her plan to quit, and in looking anywhere but at Kara \u2013 that Kara knows it\u2019s over.</p>\n<p>This is happening, and she needs to just accept it.</p>\n<p>It feels like a startling break in the routine when, after the annual end-of-year staff meeting, Cat asks Kara to stay behind. Alone.</p>\n<p>Cat\u2019s office seems like the only space in the school untouched by end-of-year mania. Every office and classroom in the school is a little messier than usual, perhaps inspired by the stress of students and teachers compounded into a few short weeks, but Cat\u2019s office is as spotless as ever. It\u2019s glowing orange with the setting sun, and as Kara takes a seat again, the principal spins her chair around to pin Kara with a piercing look.</p>\n<p>If she ever decided to leave the school, Kara thinks, Cat Grant would make an absolutely terrifying businesswoman.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. Miss Luthor is leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was expecting this to be the topic of conversation, given their shared class and the letter of resignation Kara submitted a few days ago, but Kara still feels like she\u2019s been gut-punched.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says quietly, and Cat continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs are you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara swallows, fidgeting with her glasses and wishing she could just leave without being considered rude. \u201cMiss Grant, if you\u2019re upset that I didn\u2019t give enough notice \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gave four months, it\u2019s more than adequate,\u201d Cat says, waving her off. \u201cNo, I called you here because both you and Miss Luthor are leaving at the end of the school year, ostensibly free from the constraints of inter-workplace dating, and yet you\u2019re still dancing around each other like a couple of teenagers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s stomach drops out completely.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s still in the \u2018complete and total shock\u2019 stage when Cat bulldozes on, uncaring of Kara\u2019s state of anxiety.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, I don\u2019t normally make a habit out of dabbling in the lives of my employees. I find it exhausting, and usually uninteresting. But you two have had eyes for each other since the second Miss Luthor stepped foot in my school, and quite frankly, your new mopey \u2018woe is me\u2019 cycle is getting to be too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara finally snaps out of her stupor, shaking her head and laughing a bit disbelievingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Grant, I don\u2019t think you understand \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve been sleeping together for most of the year?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara stares at her, mouth agape. Cat just stares at her, an eyebrow quirked in a way that reminds her painfully of Lena.</p>\n<p>\n<em>How does she know?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as subtle as you think you are, Miss Danvers,\u201d Cat says, as if she can read Kara\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Maybe she can. Maybe that\u2019s how she found out. Maybe she\u2019s actually some kind of mind-reading alien and she runs this school as a cover.</em>\n</p>\n<p>She\u2019s brought back to the ground from her panic-spiral by Cat talking again, her tone brokering no argument.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to offer something I don\u2019t give out very often \u2013 advice. A connection like yours doesn\u2019t come around every day. Whatever your damages are, whatever inadequacies you think you have, I can guarantee that Lena doesn\u2019t care, just as you don\u2019t care about hers.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true. Kara doesn\u2019t care about whatever Lena thinks she lacks. She wants her, no matter what. Exactly as she is. But it just doesn\u2019t seem <em>possible</em> for Lena to feel the same way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe way I see it, the two of you have about two weeks to get your act together \u2013 and one of you needs to take the first step,\u201d Cat says, and Kara balks at the idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Grant, she doesn\u2019t feel that way about me. And even if she did \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cKara,\u201d Cat interrupts, and Kara is startled into silence by the uncharacteristic use of her first name. Cat never uses <em>anyone\u2019s</em> first name. \u201cI am not asking for your perspective. I am telling you\u2026to jump.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJump?\u201d Kara echoes, brow furrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jump</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cat\u2019s gaze is suddenly intense, and it feels more serious than it was before. Like Cat is genuinely invested in this. In Kara\u2019s happiness, with Lena.</p>\n<p>Kara considers it, this strange advice her soon-to-be-ex boss is offering. <em>Jump</em>. Take a leap of faith.</p>\n<p>A leap of faith that could go horribly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if \u2013\u201c Kara starts, but Cat rolls her eyes, cutting Kara off with a wave.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve offered my advice, and you can take it or not. Now, get out of here and go home. Think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara goes, and true to Cat\u2019s command, she thinks about it for the entirety of the final two weeks of school.</p>\n<p>They pass in a flash, or so it feels to Kara. It seems like the blink of an eye before exams are over and the Mathletes are having an after-school end-of-year party to say goodbye. It\u2019s a yearly affair, usually to bid farewell to the students who are graduating, but this year it has extra meaning - the students were all devastated when Lena announced that she wouldn\u2019t be coming back next year, and it was even worse when, a week later, Kara announced her intent to leave as well.</p>\n<p>While Lena hadn\u2019t looked surprised, she did look almost as heartbroken by the news as their students. But, as per usual, she and Kara hadn\u2019t talked about it. Lena had just excused herself from the meeting as soon as it was over, and Kara hadn\u2019t seen her until their shared class the next day.</p>\n<p>The party is as sad as it is celebratory, the younger students upset that both their friends and their favourite teachers are leaving, and Lena spends most of it engaged in conversation with them, giving promises of reference letters for college and very obviously trying to avoid talking to Kara. And Kara, true to form, hovers close by and agonizes over breaking the pattern.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something final about the gathering that makes Kara feel\u2026different. The fear is still there, the anxiety that\u2019s kept her from speaking to Lena for weeks now, but it\u2019s being pushed down by something else \u2013 the conversation she had with Cat is still ringing in her ears, the older woman\u2019s words echoing through her head every time she looks at Lena.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Jump, Miss Danvers.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And besides that, with this party comes the deep, crushing knowledge that this very well may be the last time she sees Lena in person. The last time she can see her smile for real, the last time she can look into those green eyes and tell her how incredible she is.</p>\n<p>This is it. She has nothing to lose, now.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What am I waiting for?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Gathering her wits, Kara eases herself into the tail end of Lena\u2019s conversation with Eve and Ruby and plucks at her sleeve gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eve and Ruby exchange a look that\u2019s a little too knowing for Kara\u2019s comfort, but Lena nods after only a moment\u2019s hesitation, and Kara leads her to a quiet corner of their classroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena, I know we never agreed on anything. This was all\u2026casual, and impermanent, and I was okay with that,\u201d Kara starts as soon as they\u2019re alone, wringing her hands nervously. \u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m <em>really</em> going to miss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s ramrod-straight spine softens a little, and she actually meets Kara\u2019s eyes for the first time, looking almost as sad as Kara feels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, too,\u201d Lena says, so quietly that it\u2019s almost a whisper. \u201cIf it counts for anything, I\u2019m sorry for how things ended.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Kara sighs, barely resisting the temptation to pull Lena into a hug to ease the pain she can see on her face.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet, for a moment. Both of them look away from each other, unable to keep up such intense eye contact for long, and instead stand together observing their students. It\u2019s Kara who finally breaks the silence, still not quite brave enough to look Lena in the eyes as she speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really see why we couldn\u2019t just keep going as we were. For a little while longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s answer is not what she expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you know why.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something kindles in Kara\u2019s chest at the words. Something hopeful. <em>You know why</em>. But, it can\u2019t be the reason she thinks.</p>\n<p>Can it?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Kara stutters, trying to catch her mouth up to her brain. \u201cWait, what do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think how we feel is pretty obvious,\u201d Lena mutters, as if the knowledge of it is irritating in some way. But it\u2019s not irritating to Kara. It\u2019s <em>wonderful</em>. It\u2019s setting off firecrackers in her chest. <em>How we feel.</em></p>\n<p>Lena has feelings for her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you felt\u2026<em>anything</em>,\u201d Kara says, her voice noticeably trembling. \u201cYou never said \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Lena sighs, rubbing the bridge of her nose. \u201cHow could I not, Kara?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara huffs, throwing her arms up before remembering they\u2019re supposed to be covert. She folds them tightly, but it doesn\u2019t stop her from talking. \u201cWell then why \u2013 I don\u2019t understand. Why not try? Lena, I\u2019m crazy about you, I always have been \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you deserve better!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s outburst is unexpected, and loud. Several of the students look their way, and Lena flushes bright red, her jaw clenched and nostrils flaring.</p>\n<p>This is not a conversation to have in front of teenagers. Still reeling from the impact of Lena\u2019s words, Kara pulls on Lena\u2019s arm gently until they\u2019re both out in the empty hallway, closing the door behind them. Only then does she let out her reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena sighs, rubbing her arms in a way that signals that she\u2019s deeply uncomfortable, but this isn\u2019t the moment for Kara to ease up. She\u2019s close to something, here, and she can\u2019t leave \u2013 she can\u2019t let Lena go \u2013 until she knows what it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not capable of the kind of things you deserve, Kara,\u201d Lena finally says, her voice heavy. \u201cAffection, and honesty. A real, healthy relationship. I spent this whole year \u2013 I was \u2013 <em>using</em> you, giving you whiplash just because I couldn\u2019t repress my stupid urges, and it wasn\u2019t fair to you but I kept doing it because I\u2019m selfish and \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Lena is on a rant, now, so determined in her self-loathing that Kara can hardly get a word in edgewise, as much as she tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena, you didn\u2019t <em>use</em> me,\u201d Klara insists incredulously. \u201cIf anything I was using <em>you</em>, I\u2019ve loved you for years and I jumped at the first chance to have sex with you and I didn\u2019t even ask <em>questions</em> \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>But Lena seems not to hear her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now, I\u2019m going to be working all hours of the day getting this new National City branch of LuthorCorp started, and god knows if I can\u2019t manage a normal relationship with a teacher\u2019s schedule I can\u2019t handle it as a CFO \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Whatever Lena says afterwards is important, Kara is sure, but her mind snags on that last part. National City branch of LuthorCorp. <em>National City</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, repeat that?\u201d Kara asks, blinking owlishly, and Lena repeats herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, I\u2019m not capable \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, the other thing,\u201d Kara interrupts again, waving that self-doubt away. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to be here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lena says, frowning. \u201cBut, that\u2019s not the point \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Like the power was just turned on in her brain, Kara sees this entire year in a new light.</p>\n<p>Lena didn\u2019t break things off because she doesn\u2019t care, or because she\u2019s leaving the city to move across the country \u2013 she did it because she thinks that she can\u2019t be what Kara wants.</p>\n<p>But all Kara wants is <em>Lena</em>.</p>\n<p>With an intensity she didn\u2019t know she had, Kara takes both of Lena\u2019s hands in hers and holds them to her chest, and just like Cat suggested, she jumps.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena, I have been nuts about you since the second I saw you in your office 3 years ago. I\u2019ve spent the last year taking whatever you felt capable of giving, because I was selfish and I didn\u2019t want to give up being close to you \u2013 but I always thought you were going to leave, that you deserved better than me. And here you were, apparently thinking that I deserve better than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like a new kind of release, finally getting all of this off her chest. She thought that it would be scary, would be embarrassing, but it just feels like relief. And through her whole speech Lena blinks at her, wide-eyed, her fingers flexing and unflexing against the skin of Kara\u2019s sternum.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere <em>isn\u2019t</em> any better than you,\u201d Kara continues, her voice hushed and focused. This is a make-or-break moment, and she can\u2019t mess it up. \u201cI want <em>you</em>. Don\u2019t you think that maybe, we could stop deciding what each other <em>deserves</em> and actually find happiness\u2026together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena bites her lip, and Kara can see her resolve wavering.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook\u2026I\u2019ve thought about this too,\u201d Lena admits quietly, and Kara feels like she could fly even at such a tiny admission, filled with so much doubt. \u201cBut I\u2019d be so bad for you. I\u2019d break you, Kara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty strong,\u201d Kara says, and Lena huffs out a little laugh. It feels so good to see her laugh again, to make her laugh again, that Kara just knows she can do this. She can fight for this.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult. <em>I\u2019m</em> difficult. I\u2019ve never done this before, with someone as important as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara glows with the compliment \u2013 <em>someone as important as you</em>. Knowing she\u2019s important to Lena, important enough to risk doing something she\u2019s scared of, is enough to solidify her resolve.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their faces are drifting closer together, Lena smiling even through her half-hearted protests, and Kara knows, then. She knows that this is <em>happening</em>. Lena has feelings for her, and they\u2019re doing this.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re really doing this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so hot and cold to you this year,\u201d Lena murmurs, her breath tickling Kara\u2019s lips. \u201cWhy do you even want me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara leans in, cupping Lena\u2019s jaw with soft hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lena Luthor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over the past year, Kara has kissed Lena what feels like hundreds of times, in a hundred wildly different situations. Each and every one felt life-changing, in their own way. But this kiss, tinged with the knowledge that this isn\u2019t just temporary, that her feelings aren\u2019t just inconvenient but that they\u2019re appreciated, that they\u2019re <em>returned</em>, is the best of them all. It\u2019s their softest one yet, just a gentle meeting of lips with the barest hint of tongue, and it makes Kara\u2019s chest feel like it\u2019s going to overflow.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s perfect. Absolutely perfect. <em>Nothing</em> could ruin this moment.</p>\n<p>Nothing except for a single, high-pitched squeal somewhere to her left.</p>\n<p>About a split second before the commotion starts, Kara remembers where they are. Spotting movement out of the corner of her eye, she\u2019s made suddenly aware that their classroom door has a very large window.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she whispers, and Lena has just enough time to shoot her a questioning look before the door swings open and 14 voices start to yell in a cacophony.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em> \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re kissing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>knew</em> it! Eve, I told you, I <em>told</em> you they were \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you guys gonna get married?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara just laughs, kissing Lena\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s a little embarrassing, that they were apparently so much less subtle than she thought, but it\u2019s nice having their little group be almost as excited as she is. Right now, she can just be happy thinking about the future. Their future, together.</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s fingers lace with hers, and Kara answers the most pertinent question.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. We are definitely going to get married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eve gets the invitation in an envelope even larger and shinier than the one MIT had sent in the spring, when her stellar reference letters and top grades had gotten her as close to a full ride scholarship as is possible when you don\u2019t play a sport. The large silver \u2018L\u2019 embossed onto the envelope is imposing, and so is its contents: a rare summer internship in the Applied Sciences Division at LuthorCorp\u2019s National City branch, under the supervision of Lena Luthor herself. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The ink of the signature is even a little smudged. Eve doesn\u2019t want to assume that Miss Luthor will be anything but perfectly professional with her, but she\u2019s oddly choked up by it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>When she strides into the marble-floored glass skyscraper for her first day, she tries her best not to get her hopes up high. \u201cUnder the supervision of Lena Luthor\u201d could mean anything \u2013 she might not even see Miss Luthor at all. Often high-up executives do this sort of thing through intermediaries. She just has to work hard, and maybe \u2013</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the woman at the front desk says, looking up at her expectantly, and Eve jumps.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh! Yes. Um, Eve Tessmacher? I\u2019m here for the internship program?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The woman looks down at her computer screen, typing something quick as lightning, and then she looks back up at Eve with a smile. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOf course, Miss Tessmacher. Miss Luthor has been expecting you.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cShe \u2013 she has?\u201d Eve asks, her entire morning thrown off by this information. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOf course! You\u2019ll be working down in the lab this summer, but Miss Luthor requested your presence in her office before you start. It\u2019s on the top floor, you can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eve is almost hyperventilating by the time she steps out of the elevator on the top floor of the building. There\u2019s a small waiting room and a hallway, a desk with an assistant sitting behind it, and a huge door made of what looks like metal with a plaque reading <strong>\u201cLena Luthor: CEO\u201d.</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eve is about to tentatively ask the woman behind the desk where on earth she\u2019s supposed to be going when the office door opens, and Miss Luthor herself walks out holding a tablet. She doesn\u2019t even look up from whatever she\u2019s typing before she starts talking, and her assistant immediately starts taking notes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cJess, tell R&amp;D to move forward on the new water filtration systems. Make it priority number one. And push my 10 \u2018o\u2019clock to tomorrow, Kara is stopping by \u2013\u201c</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>For a second, she has to catch her breath. Miss Luthor is just as beautiful as she was when Eve first saw her, as a scared 14 year old who thought she hated math. She hasn\u2019t seen her former teacher in 3 years, and she\u2019d honestly thought her baby gay crush had faded a little, but it all comes roaring back with Miss Luthor\u2019s soft hair and bright eyes and that <strong>dress</strong> \u2013</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEve!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eve is startled violently from her ogling, and it makes her nerves settle a little to see that Miss Luthor seems genuinely happy to see her.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI was hoping they\u2019d send you up here like I asked. It\u2019s wonderful to see you!\u201d Before Eve can properly prepare for it, she\u2019s being enveloped in a warm hug, and it\u2019s only her body going on autopilot that lets her return it without freezing up. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s good to see you too, Miss Luthor!\u201d she squeaks, embarrassed at how high her own voice is. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh, please, you\u2019re not my student anymore, Eve. You can call me Lena.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh! Right. Um, Lena. Thank you so much for letting me into this program, it\u2019s such a great opportunity\u00a0\u2013\u201c </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>But Lena just waves her off, her smile reaching her eyes. She\u2019s so animated, so enthusiastic in a way that was fairly rare to see when she was Eve\u2019s teacher. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEve, your grades speak for themselves. We\u2019d be mad not to accept you. They don\u2019t let just anyone into MIT - I should know.\u201d Lena says with a wink, and Eve can\u2019t help the blush that creeps up her neck.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>She\u2019s wanted to go to MIT ever since she saw the framed degree in Lena\u2019s classroom freshman year, and it was the encouragement of her two favourite science teachers that had convinced her to focus on her studies and work hard to get accepted. So, the acknowledgement that Miss Luthor paid enough attention to know that Eve was going to her alma mater makes her glow a little bit.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cRight,\u201d Eve says, clearing her throat. \u201cWell, I\u2019m really excited to work with you. I mean, not <strong>with</strong> you, <strong>for</strong> you. I mean, I assume you won\u2019t actually be there most of the time, you have such important things to do \u2013\u201c</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh, I spend a lot of time down in the lab,\u201d Lena says, and Eve has to smother the small and excited explosion that happens in her chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing plenty of me.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Before Eve can reply the elevator doors slide open, and through them strides the second person Eve was hoping against hope she\u2019d get to see this summer. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Miss Danvers hasn\u2019t changed a bit. She\u2019s still tall and a tiny bit disheveled, wearing a button-up shirt and slacks, and she\u2019s rummaging in her messenger bag. It\u2019s almost like 3 years haven\u2019t passed at all and Eve is seeing her walk into that classroom again, throwing her bag under the desk and starting the day\u2019s new experiment. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEve!\u201d She cries as soon as she looks up, and if Eve had been wrong about her still-active crush on Lena, she was <strong>really</strong> wrong about her crush on Miss Danvers. It\u2019s also still alive and well. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLena mentioned you\u2019d be starting today!\u201d Kara says, wrapping Eve in another hug and then drawing back, holding Eve by the shoulders and looking her over like some kind of proud aunt. \u201cLook at you, already going to college. Where did the time go?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>They talked about her.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m going to MIT,\u201d Eve says a little breathlessly, as Kara moves past her. \u201cJust like Miss Luthor. I mean, Lena.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Eve!\u201d Kara says, leaning in to give Lena a quick peck. \u201cHey, love. Sorry I\u2019m late, I had to swing by the museum for a quote.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, darling.\u201d Lena\u2019s voice is soft and affectionate in a way that Eve never heard it when they worked at NC Prep, at least not in public. There\u2019s open love in her gaze, and it makes Eve feel warm.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>She feels even warmer when her eyes zero in on Lena\u2019s hand, which has come up to wipe the red lipstick stain from Kara\u2019s face \u2013 specifically, her left ring finger, where sits the biggest rock Eve has ever seen. A quick perusal of Kara\u2019s hand reveals that she has a ring too \u2013 a flat silver band lined with diamonds, glittering in the florescent light.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>When she connects the dots, she can\u2019t stop herself from speaking.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re engaged!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Kara laughs, grabbing Lena\u2019s hand and kissing her knuckles next to the ring. \u201cWe are. I told you guys I was going to marry her, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Of course Eve remembers. The Mathletes end-of-year party her freshman year, when she looked out the little glass panel in the classroom door and saw the two teachers that the entire student body had been speculating about \u2013 and she had secretly been crushing on \u2013 locked in a passionate kiss. It was the single most affirming moment of Eve\u2019s life, knowing that what she felt for girls wasn\u2019t wrong or weird. The two people she looked up to most were just like her. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Even three years later, her entire graduating class still used to read Miss Danvers\u2019 articles in the Tribune and look up interviews with Miss Luthor, trying to figure out if they were still together.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou did, I remember! I just \u2013 oh, gosh, this is so exciting!\u201d Eve trills, unable to contain her happiness. \u201cAfter you two left we never stopped talking about you, we were so hoping you were still \u2013 and now \u2013 you\u2019re getting married!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou all still talked about us?\u201d Lena asks, looking deeply touched.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOf course we did! You were so important to so many of us,\u201d Eve says. She swallows, building up her courage to tell them something that she\u2019s actually proud of herself for. \u201cI\u2026I actually started a GSA because of you. After I came out.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Kara\u2019s hand goes to her heart, and she looks genuinely close to tears. \u201cOh! Oh, that\u2019s so great! I\u2019m so happy, oh my gosh, come here \u2013\u201c </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eve manages to laugh as she gets her third hug of the day, and Lena chuckles, putting a hand on Eve\u2019s shoulder.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThat is wonderful, Eve. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Just those four words, from her former teacher and hero\u2019s mouth, are almost enough to make Eve cry. </em>\n</p>\n<p><strong> <em>I\u2019m proud of you. </em> </strong> <em>Even her own parents hadn\u2019t said that when she got accepted to school \u2013 they had just stressed about the cost, and when Eve told them she\u2019d gotten the scholarship, they complained that MIT was too far away to be able to visit. When Eve had broken the news about getting an internship with the most prestigious tech company in the country, they had only asked how she planned to get there every day. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>But Miss Luthor and Miss Danvers are proud of her. Miss Luthor wants her here, working at L-Corp. For the first time since she got that acceptance letter from her dream school, Eve actually feels the weight of her achievement. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Lena, thankfully, seems to sense it, and she leads Eve away from Kara\u2019s hug and towards the elevators.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNow, if you\u2019re done smothering my star intern, I\u2019m going to show her to the labs. I\u2019ll be back up in a bit, and we can go to the cake tasting, okay?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Kara waves excitedly as they get onto the elevator, and Lena smiles at her genuinely as she presses the button for the basement level, and as Eve hears the words <strong>my star intern</strong> echo around her head, she knows with absolute certainty that this is going to be the best summer of her life. </em>\n</p>"
