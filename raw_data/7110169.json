  "text": "<p>Jeon Jungkook does not believe in fate or destiny\u2014or comeuppance, for that matter. Sometimes Taehyung proposes that things are \u201cwritten in the stars,\u201d and Jungkook proposes that Taehyung smokes too much weed. Coincidences are coincidences, nothing more and nothing less.</p>\n<p>At least, that\u2019s where Jungkook stands until five Very Important Occurrences make him wonder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Occurrence #1, when Jeon Jungkook learns that Timberlands are not good running shoes.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0When Jungkook entered university, he asked his mother for a motorcycle. She got him a moped. It\u2019s small and drives so slow sometimes Jungkook thinks he could run faster, but he has to admit, it\u2019s pretty useful to run errands off campus. He and Taehyung tried to paint it in a vain attempt to make it look cooler, but they learned quickly enough that house paint does not hold up well on motor vehicles. Now it\u2019s baby blue with streaks of faded black. He complains about it on the regular, but he names it after his favorite superhero anyway.</p>\n<p>He leaves Stark braked on the sidewalk next to an awfully pretty silver Tivoli that\u2019s parked illegally in front of the store. Jungkook only wanders the aisles for a few moments to pick up enough ramen to last the coming week, with some choco pies for good measure. He stands at the register when he hears a nasty metal screeching sound that grates on his ears. The cashier leans to the side to look past him, and he turns around.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark lies on the ground by the Tivoli, and a long scratch adorns the side of the car from the door handle down to the sill. Jungkook throws money onto the counter without counting, grabs his bag of snacks, and runs out the door. He loops the bag around his wrist and bends to straighten Stark, whose handle shows wear from the impact.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you fall, huh?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in the middle of lifting Stark when someone yells. A guy with enviously large muscles runs toward him, keys dangling from his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do to my car?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook prides himself on his ability to make split-second decisions. Others have told him that he\u2019s rash, but he finds it a useful trait to have. Especially in situations where a guy twice his size is about to kick his ass. He turns around and books it so fast he almost drops his grocery bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet back here, asshole!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Stark,\u201d Jungkook mutters, weaving through confused pedestrians as he skids around the corner of the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in running, I\u2019ll turn in your plate to the cops\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He glances behind him. The guy is catching up frighteningly quickly. Jungkook\u2019s feet pinch uncomfortably in his hefty Timberlands. He nearly trips over himself in his haste to turn another corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were parked illegally,\u201d he shouts back, breath lost in the wind pushing against his face. \u201cHow you gonna explain that to the cops?\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the guy swear. A surge of energy propels him over a bench and into the little park tucked between the multitude of city shops. Halfway through the park, dodging some kids playing Frisbee, he looks back. The guy\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>He collapses face-first onto the grass under a tree and groans, chest heaving.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve betrayed me,\u201d he says to his shoes. \u201cI thought Timberlands were supposed to be a guy\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Occurrence #2, when Jeon Jungkook learns that bare feet are even worse. </em>\n</p>\n<p>When the girl he goes home with after a party turns out to have a boyfriend, and said boyfriend turns out to be the guy with the Tivoli, Jungkook\u2019s first thought is that Taehyung would call this \u201ckarma.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s not much room to think when he\u2019s ducking past a massive angry dude to skid down the stairwell of Eunbi\u2019s apartment building. The Boyfriend might have bigger muscles than him, but Jungkook\u2019s fast. That\u2019s the only reason he got away the first time. He takes the stairs three at a time, cement cold on his bare feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet back here, you fucking prick,\u201d the Boyfriend yells. He\u2019s a good two floors behind. \u201cFirst my car, now my girlfriend\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook propels himself over the last railing with a rather impressive leap and bursts out the door, kicking it shut behind him. It clangs but he can still hear the Boyfriend shouting. He shields his eyes from the abruptly harsh sunlight and runs around the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d A voice calls. He looks up. Eunbi leans out of a fifth floor window, waving, her delicate dressing gown loose around her shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you have a boyfriend?\u201d He tries to sound intimidating but it comes out like a whine. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOops,\u201d she says, and giggles.</p>\n<p><em>Oops</em>, he thinks. Fucking <em>oops</em>. \u201cCan you at least toss me my clothes?\u201d</p>\n<p>But then the door bangs open and Jungkook starts running with an annoyed huff. His favorite snapback lies somewhere on the floor of Eunbi\u2019s bedroom. And running through campus wearing only a pair of Iron Man boxers is not exactly how he wants to be remembered. He can almost imagine it, years after graduation, some bratty freshman\u2014<em>I heard this dude did the walk of shame but, like, to the max</em>. He halfheartedly tries to hide his chest as he runs (he likes his chest, he\u2019s worked hard on his chest, but this is <em>not</em> how he wants people to see it).</p>\n<p>Thankfully it\u2019s still a little early for campus to be too busy on a Saturday morning. He loses the Boyfriend somewhere between the dining hall and his apartment building. The girl sitting at the front desk with her nose buried in a comic shoots him a bored glance.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do this time, Jeon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of your business, Ahn.\u201d</p>\n<p>He ends up in the elevator with a guy who keeps shooting him sideways glances and snickering, like he thinks Jungkook won\u2019t notice. Jungkook flexes a little and growls when he gets off on his floor, and the guy shrinks back.</p>\n<p>Of course he doesn\u2019t have his keys or his wallet or his phone. So he stands outside banging on the door until Taehyung finally opens it in a Pokemon onesie. It\u2019s seven in the morning but he\u2019s eating out of a tub of ice cream.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that mine?\u201d Jungkook says about the onesie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours and what\u2019s yours is mine, my friend. What happened to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook slumps forward, dropping his head on Taehyung\u2019s warm shoulder, the adrenaline of the run finally catching up to him. \u201cShe has a <em>boyfriend</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment Taehyung is silent, and Jungkook wonders if he might get a lecture or something. But then Taehyung laughs so hard he snorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Occurrence #3, when Jeon Jungkook discovers the aesthetic appeal of orange hair. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He sits in his usual corner of the dining hall when a boy slides into one of the plastic chairs two tables away. The boy first catches Jungkook\u2019s attention because his hair is bright orange. It\u2019s parted in the middle, falling in loose waves around his forehead. He has pretty skin and pretty lips and though he\u2019s clearly fit, he looks small even sitting down. He opens a thick English book and reads it while eating a salad. Jungkook is briefly offended that a boy so beautiful goes to his university and he\u2019s only just found out. By rule, Jungkook knows every beautiful boy and girl on campus.</p>\n<p>He debates whether or not to take the empty seat next to him when a girl approaches. She\u2019s cute, the skirt of her pretty blue dress bouncing as she stops by his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, excuse me.\u201d They are near enough that her soft voice carries over to Jungkook.</p>\n<p>The orange-haired boy glances up absently. \u201cOh, hey.\u201d She hesitates long enough that he says, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d He has a light voice, high and musical with a slight lisp.</p>\n<p>Jungkook can visibly see her steeling herself. \u201cI, um, really like you and I was wondering if maybe we could go on a date. Grab coffee or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy\u2019s brow furrows, and she deflates. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t really date.\u201d Her head bows a little, and he hurries to say, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal. I just don\u2019t really have time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaves, probably pretending to act all right, and the boy drops his head onto his book with an audible groan. He doesn\u2019t go back to reading after that. Jungkook sits there with his rice and stew and watches the boy push around his food, chin in hand. He looks like he might start crying at any moment. Jungkook can\u2019t remember ever feeling so sad after turning someone down.</p>\n<p>After a little while, the boy leaves, and Jungkook returns to playing Piano Tiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Occurrence #4, when Kim Taehyung almost comes in handy. </em>\n</p>\n<p>They\u2019re sitting on a bench outside the arts building when someone calls Taehyung\u2019s name. It\u2019s the orange-haired boy, switching directions to walk toward them. The bench fits three people but Taehyung\u2019s legs take up the third space as he leans his back into Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, playing some dumb coffee shop game on his phone. Jungkook sits slumped, his legs outstretched, an energy drink dangling from one hand.</p>\n<p>Taehyung drops his phone on his stomach to wave. \u201cJimin!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances between Taehyung and the boy named Jimin. He\u2019s dressed like he just got back from the gym, cut arms on display in a loose tank, a sports bag hoisted over one shoulder. He smiles, but he might as well have punched Jungkook in the face. It\u2019s the cutest smile he\u2019s ever seen in his life. One small dimple, eyes curved into crescents, cheeks puffed out.</p>\n<p>Jimin stops beside Jungkook\u2019s sprawled legs, glancing at him as if waiting for him to move so he can reach Taehyung. Jungkook blinks lazily and doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Jimin says, a small note of irritation in his voice. Jungkook smirks and draws his legs back slowly, Timberlands scraping against the sidewalk. Jimin passes to stop in front of Taehyung. \u201cHey, here are your notes.\u201d He tugs a stack of papers from his bag and hands them to Taehyung. \u201cThanks again for letting me borrow them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you started studying for the exam yet? I heard it\u2019s wicked hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. Wanna study together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Jimin looks away, biting his plump bottom lip in thought. He runs a hand through his hair. It falls back into place slightly messy. It looks soft. Taehyung nudges Jungkook; he realizes he\u2019s staring. \u201cI gotta work tonight and tomorrow I have dance practice and Monday I\u2019m volunteering at the school so, um. How about Tuesday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool, see you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waves and walks away after a brief glance at Jungkook, who is treated to a nice view of his firm ass as he leaves. As soon as he\u2019s out of earshot, Jungkook jolts upright, shoving Taehyung off him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know him? Who is he? Is he single?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOw.\u201d Taehyung rubs the back of his head where Jungkook\u2019s shoulder bumped into it. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw him the other day and goddam he is <em>fine</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to cum in your pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPiss off.\u201d Jungkook turns fully in the bench to face Taehyung. \u201cSo you know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess. We sit next to each other in theory class. He\u2019s an education major, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIntroduce me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not really friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know his name. He said \u2018hi.\u2019 That\u2019s pretty much all there is to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know all you might need to get in someone\u2019s pants is a name and a positive greeting, but unlike you, I do have standards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when that guy said your hair was ugly and you fucked him anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s mouth curls into an unnecessary pout. \u201cThat was one time and he was <em>cute</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll you have to do is introduce me. I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Kook. I know Jimin\u2019s hot, but it\u2019s probably not going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he straight? Because this one time I got a straight guy to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, I don\u2019t wanna hear it.\u201d Taehyung shoves his fingers in his ears, humming loudly until Jungkook\u2019s mouth stops moving. \u201cHe\u2019s not straight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin\u2019s, like, notoriously single. As in, he wants to keep it that way.\u201d Taehyung taps his lip thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure everyone in our major has had the hots for him at least once, but he doesn\u2019t date anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna date him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t fuck around, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know? You\u2019re not friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause everyone knows. Because everyone\u2019s disappointed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could at least try.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Taehyung\u2019s not listening anymore. His gaze has caught on a girl walking two Maltese puppies across the library. It\u2019s the puppies that have his attention. Jungkook groans, knowing he\u2019s lost Taehyung entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Occurrence #5, when Kim Taehyung proposes a bet, and Jeon Jungkook starts to believe in fate.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Jungkook takes Stark to a nearby auto shop to check on the brakes after the fiasco with the Boyfriend. His eyes still feel puffy with sleep, unused to waking up this early. Just his luck that the only appointment left was seven in the morning on a Saturday. The auto shop is small, barely enough room for two cars in the garage at a time, but it\u2019s the closest one to campus and he heard that an honest and reliable man runs it.</p>\n<p>He parks Stark outside the shopfront and jogs up to the door. Through the glass windows, he can see someone at the counter, back turned to the door. His hand touches the handle when the guy turns around, and Jungkook freezes. The orange hair really should have given it away. Jimin wears a navy blue mechanic\u2019s jumpsuit, but he\u2019s unbuttoned the top and let it fall around his waist to reveal a white tank top with a grease stain just under the neckline. For a moment Jungkook stares at his bare arms and smooth collarbones, and then he realizes that Jimin\u2019s here. Jimin, who absolutely cannot know that he rides a baby blue moped.</p>\n<p>He removes his hand and steps back, but that\u2019s when Jimin looks up. Jungkook stares. Jimin raises a hand and beckons. He doesn\u2019t really have a choice after that. The door chime tinkles when he pushes it open.</p>\n<p>Standing across the counter from him, Jungkook is struck by just how small Jimin is.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d Jimin says.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2014my, uh\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s gaze travels behind him to land on the moped. His rather bored expression turns to one of amusement as he returns his attention to Jungkook. \u201cThat yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sniffs and resumes some of his usual bravado. \u201cYeah, what of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes twinkle, a soft curve to the end of his mouth. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrakes. Parked him the other day, and he started moving all on his own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have an appointment, right?\u201d Jimin sifts through a fat binder sitting on the counter, stopping by what must be Jungkook\u2019s name. Even his hands are small, with cute, chubby fingers. \u201cA mechanic should be with you in a few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a mechanic?\u201d Jungkook blurts, eyeing his clothes.</p>\n<p>Jimin raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m kind of like an assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I just thought\u2014never mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can wait in one of the chairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook mentally smacks himself. He\u2019s usually a lot smoother than that. He takes a seat by the window and glances periodically back at Jimin, who busies himself writing in the big binder. His fluffy orange hair falls into his eyes, and every now and then he emits a frustrated whoosh of air to shake it away. When he does his cheeks puff out even more than usual, and he looks downright adorable.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is thinking about how <em>tiny</em> he is when the sound of a car\u2019s engine causes him to glance outside. A silver Tivoli with a scratch down the side pulls up in front of the shop, right next to Stark. Jungkook\u2019s eyes widen. Three times in one week might be too much for just coincidence. The driver\u2019s side door opens, and Jungkook makes another split-second decision.</p>\n<p>He leaps to his feet and catapults behind the counter.</p>\n<p>Jimin steps back, too shocked to react at first, so Jungkook tucks in all his limbs to ensure that not a single piece of himself is visible. He looks up at Jimin, who\u2019s staring at him with an open mouth. Jungkook puts a finger to his lips and mouths <em>please</em>.</p>\n<p>The chime jingles as the Boyfriend shoves the door open rather forcefully from the sound of it. Jungkook tries to breathe a little quieter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhose moped is that out there?\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks back up. Jimin has turned to face the newcomer, a neutral expression on his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe moped. Where\u2019s the owner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can release that information,\u201d Jimin says smoothly.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, dude. The asshole who rides that moped scratched up my car and slept with my girlfriend. He\u2019s got it coming.\u201d The note of desperation in his voice makes Jungkook stifle a chuckle, a hand pressed to his mouth. Jimin\u2019s foot shifts to nudge his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat really sucks. But I\u2019d get fired if I told you. Sorry, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Boyfriend sighs heavily. \u201cYeah, I understand. I came to make an appointment to fix the scratch.\u201d</p>\n<p>They talk for a little while, and Jungkook makes sure not to move until the chime sounds and Jimin\u2019s foot nudges him again, harder this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou slept with his girlfriend? That\u2019s shitty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me she had a boyfriend,\u201d Jungkook mumbles, rubbing his side and pulling himself up by the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d It\u2019s obvious that Jimin doesn\u2019t believe him.</p>\n<p>The entrance of an older man who must be the actual mechanic interrupts any chance to pursue the subject. After that Jungkook can\u2019t interact with Jimin much, busy with his moped and the mechanic. But when he gets home, he kicks his shoes off into the living room with unnecessary force and barges into Taehyung\u2019s bedroom to tell him the story.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s meant to be,\u201d he says when he finally finishes. \u201cThat\u2019s way too many coincidences for one week. Everything\u2019s adding up like some kind of teen movie shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t believe in fate.\u201d Taehyung looks a little offended, pushing Jungkook\u2019s head off his lap. He has every right to be, considering how often Jungkook mocks him for his outrageous claims about destiny and stars.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t but this is too weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, Jungkook, he\u2019s a losing battle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll turn me down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s lip curls in disgust as he eyes Jungkook head to toe.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Kim Taehyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still older than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Tae<em>hyung</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, if you wanna get rejected, go for it.\u201d Taehyung settles against the wall, crossing his arms moodily.</p>\n<p>Jungkook drops his head back on Taehyung\u2019s lap. \u201cDid you <em>see</em> his ass?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung pats his forehead in mock comfort. \u201cMighty fine ass, it is. And you\u2019re never getting your hands on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s glare fades quickly into a mischievous grin. \u201cKim Taehyung, is that a challenge?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung narrows his eyes. When it comes down to it, he\u2019s awfully competitive. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on the table?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet Jimin to sleep with you by the end of the semester and you can use my Xbox whenever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you serious? You\u2019re putting your Xbox on the line for a bet I\u2019m definitely going to win?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself, brat. You\u2019re guaranteed to lose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what do I get if you fail?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to do my laundry for a whole semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even do my own laundry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter start learning.\u201d A wicked grin spreads across Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cDeal?\u201d He spits in his hand and holds it out for Jungkook to shake.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Jungkook says, and does the same.</p>\n<p>They have progressed six weeks into the new semester, and Jungkook still has nothing to show for it. He walks across campus with Taehyung to a party at Hoseok\u2019s house, dressed to kill but not sure if he\u2019s capable of the killing. Until Jimin, he had always proved incredibly successful at picking people up. Now he feels like a failure.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing Jimin doesn\u2019t party, does he?\u201d Jungkook mumbles gloomily, running a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re ruining it.\u201d Taehyung swats his hand away and pats down the bangs. He has a bottle of Tequila tucked under one arm. \u201cOperation Seduce Jimin not going so well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s so fucking oblivious, hyung. I\u2019ve never met anyone so oblivious in my whole life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Taehyung sounds far too gleeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve dropped, like, fifty hints. He never even reacts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe probably just doesn\u2019t care. Actually, I\u2019m really impressed that you manage to pick anyone up at all. You\u2019re awful at flirting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember that time you tried to hit on a girl by asking her if she wanted to see your Naruto poster?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was high school. That doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Taehyung pats Jungkook\u2019s cheek with a dreamy look. \u201cThe good old days, when Kookie was a shy little baby who couldn\u2019t even answer questions in class. What happened to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuck my dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, if you want\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shoves Taehyung\u2019s face away with a disgusted noise. Hoseok\u2019s apartment building stands just off campus, a rather dilapidated place where the landlord doesn\u2019t care how loud they party, but also never calls pest control. Flashing neon lights shine from two third-floor windows. They can hear the bass from the ground. Taehyung nimbly heads up the staircase first, long legs straining his leather pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo body shots this time,\u201d Jungkook calls after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d Taehyung throws back, laughing. The sparkle in his gaze tells Jungkook body shots are probably the first thing he\u2019ll do.</p>\n<p>\u201cLast week you fell asleep in my bed all sticky with saliva and alcohol. I had to sleep on the floor <em>and</em> wash my sheets. I never wash my sheets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I did you a favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung stops in front of Hoseok\u2019s door at the end of the long hallway. He fixes his hair and narrows his eyes, dark eyeliner giving him a sultry look. Then he knocks, three loud bangs. Bigbang thrums through the walls, shaking the door handle. A moment later, Hoseok opens the door, flushed and grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy favorite boys!\u201d Hoseok exclaims, flinging his arms around their necks. Their heads knock together uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019d you bring me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung produces the bottle of Tequila and Hoseok whistles.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d bring me something good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He yanks them inside. They aren\u2019t early, so most of the crowd is already drunk and dancing in the middle of the living room, where Hoseok has pushed all the furniture to the corners. Neon spinning disco lights sit on various tables, providing the only light other than the glow of the kitchen. Dark curtains cover the windows. Jungkook comes to Hoseok\u2019s apartment for parties frequently, but it still surprises him how many people he manages to pack into so small a place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hoseok kicks the door shut and pushes them in the direction of the kitchen. Various forms of alcohol and empty cups cover the counter, along with more than a few colored spills. A giggling couple embraces by the fridge. Jungkook and Taehyung pour each other\u2019s shots for a while before joining the crowd in the living room. Hoseok dances in the middle amidst cheers. Off to the side, Wheein, the cute girl who\u2019s always at every party, stumbles against a table. Hoseok beelines toward her immediately. He can be wild when he\u2019s drunk, but he also turns into kind of a mom. Jungkook has been on the receiving end of his drunk caretaking one too many times.</p>\n<p>Jungkook surveys the crowd for anyone interesting. Maybe he can get his game back on tonight. Jimin makes him feel like he doesn\u2019t even have any. Taehyung drifts off to talk to some classmates, and Jungkook finds a guy from his art history lecture.</p>\n<p>\u201cPartying the night before the exam?\u201d Yugyeom says, laughing. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not all that worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be. Don\u2019t you always get good marks in that class? Do you even study?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Jungkook shrugs easily. He doesn\u2019t really pay attention in class, either, but he\u2019s managed to pull decent grades on every assignment thus far. It\u2019s like that with most of his classes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTried, but fuck, I\u2019ll probably fail. Wish I had your brain.\u201d</p>\n<p>An arm wraps around Jungkook\u2019s neck, tugging him away. \u201cJungkookie, you didn\u2019t update me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook waves to Yugyeom and lets Hoseok pull him back to the kitchen for more drinks. \u201cUpdate you on what, hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on. You spent like half an hour trying to wheedle every tiny piece of information about Jiminie from me, and you\u2019re not even gonna tell me what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. That.\u201d Jungkook takes a swig of his drink moodily. Two weeks ago Taehyung had accidentally let slip that Hoseok and Jimin danced together, so Jungkook interrogated Hoseok until he found out just about everything he needed to know. Jimin moved to Seoul from Busan for university, he danced on Hoseok\u2019s team, and he volunteered at a daycare but wished it was a school because he was studying to be an English teacher. He had two jobs: one as a barista in the caf\u00e9 near the library, and one at the auto shop his uncle owned. He busted his ass to do well in school, send money home to his family, and fulfil his passion of dancing\u2014and he most definitely did not have time for little shits like Jeon Jungkook (Hoseok\u2019s words).</p>\n<p>\u201cGuessing it didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not interested in me. At all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok snorts. \u201cSmart kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook whines, hitting his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, Jungkookie, talk to me about it.\u201d Hoseok steers them to a couch in the corner and shoos away two girls making out. \u201cTell me the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you, my mother?\u201d Jungkook complains, but he still says, \u201cI keep trying to hit on Jimin hyung but I don\u2019t think he knows I\u2019m trying to hit on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww,\u201d Hoseok coos. \u201cYou call him hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how many times have you tried hitting on him, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says. They have to yell a little to be heard, and the couch smells like alcohol, but Jungkook really wants to talk. He doesn\u2019t trust Taehyung because he would probably try to sabotage him with shitty advice. \u201cYou in for the long haul?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re sitting down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThree times. And they didn\u2019t go very well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Attempt #1: when Park Jimin mistakes advances for friendliness.</em>\n</p>\n<p>After wringing information out of Hoseok, Jungkook takes his project for his drawing course to the little caf\u00e9 tucked in next to the library. It\u2019s called Dream Bean, and its wooden benches are always full of students with laptops and textbooks open and busy. Student artwork covers the fake stone walls. One of Jungkook\u2019s paintings from freshman year hangs behind the counter. Despite that, he doesn\u2019t come here often, which explains why he\u2019s never seen Jimin before.</p>\n<p>Jungkook places the sketchbook where he\u2019s planning his project on a high stool at the bar, directly behind which the baristas make the coffee. Then he sidles up to the counter. Jimin\u2019s at the register, wearing a black trucker hat with the Dream Bean logo of a steaming coffee cup. An apron hugs his waist, the short sleeves of a black uniform polo loose around his biceps. His coworker flits in and out of the storage room.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Jimin says, a little surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the not-mechanic,\u201d Jungkook says as if he didn\u2019t specifically plan to find him here. Now that he\u2019s talking to Jimin, he feels a little like a stalker.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the guy with the baby blue moped.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook bristles immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s not baby blue. It\u2019s like,\u201d he hesitates, trying to think of something, \u201cwater blue.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks that they\u2019ve already gotten off to a bad start, but then he realizes Jimin\u2019s lips are curving up into a full blown grin, teeth on display. Then he laughs, a high-pitched giggle that makes Jungkook\u2019s stomach flutter. \u201cWater is clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Jimin laughs again, then gestures to the chalkboard menu hanging behind him. \u201cWhat are you getting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Jungkook didn\u2019t think this through. He doesn\u2019t actually like coffee. \u201cAn Americano?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does that sound like a question?\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes crinkle into a smile again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmericano,\u201d he repeats more firmly. \u201cMedium.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I get your name for the order?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I get yours?\u201d Jungkook leans forward a little, an eyebrow raised. Jimin pauses from where he\u2019s fiddling with the cash register to look up.</p>\n<p>He holds his gaze for a second, and Jungkook\u2019s sure he\u2019s gotten the hint, but then Jimin\u2019s face melts into a smile. \u201cJimin, nice to meet you!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s perfectly friendly and not suggestive at all and Jungkook groans internally. \u201cJungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be 4,000 won, Jungkook-ssi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can just call me Jungkook.\u201d He passes over the money, and goes to sit at the counter.</p>\n<p>He tries to look busy with his sketchbook. Jimin takes a few more orders before he comes to stand in front of Jungkook and make drinks. A funny concentrated expression adorns his face as he works the machine and mixes syrups. <em>Jeon Jungkook</em>, he tells himself, <em>you need to up your game</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung said you were an education major.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin glances over. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re in the same year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019re older than me. Can I call you hyung?\u201d He leans his chin in his hand, eyes focused intently on Jimin.</p>\n<p>But Jimin just smiles. \u201cSure. Are you an art major?\u201d He nods to Jungkook\u2019s sketchbook as he tops off a drink with a gratuitous amount of whipped cream. \u201cIced coffee for Jaebum-ssi,\u201d he says, sliding it across the pickup counter.</p>\n<p>A good-looking guy comes up to take it. \u201cThanks.\u201d He winks. Jimin looks a little flustered.</p>\n<p>Jungkook squeezes his pencil too tightly. Now <em>that</em> is game. \u201cYeah, fine arts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your focus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one yet. But I like painting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s in grad school here doing photography, but he was art for undergrad. Do you know Yoongi hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Every art major knows Min Yoongi. Small, blunt, and incredibly talented, Jungkook isn\u2019t sure if Yoongi inspires him or intimidates him. Once Yoongi caught a picture of two professors having an affair and turned it in as his final project\u2014for one of the professors involved. He\u2019s kind of a legend. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s your Americano.\u201d Jimin hands it to him. Jungkook takes it carefully, making sure his fingers brush unnecessarily against Jimin\u2019s small ones. He holds his gaze as he does, lets it flicker down to Jimin\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, hyung,\u201d he says, and smirks.</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks. \u201cSure, no problem!\u201d And then he\u2019s busy with the machines again like nothing happened at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hoseok snorts with laughter. It turns into a cough almost immediately. \u201cI think I just snorted up vodka,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserve it for laughing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me, Kookie.\u201d He starts to laugh again and hiccups. \u201cWhy are you trying to be subtle? Just tell him you wanna\u2014\u201d hiccup\u2014 \u201cfuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t being subtle. I\u2019m pretty sure I stared at his ass for a good minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. He doesn\u2019t even react.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not interested.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut everyone always reacts, at least. He doesn\u2019t even notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to get rejected more,\u201d Hoseok says in a very serious tone, as if he\u2019s dispensing important advice. \u201cYou\u2019re too used to people liking you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna lose this bet and then have to do hyung\u2019s laundry for a whole semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>On cue, the grating noise of wood scraping wood reaches their ears as a few girls drag a table into the middle of the living room. Jungkook blinks and Taehyung\u2019s lying on it, shirtless, a line of salt just above the low waistband of his leather pants and a lime in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI fucking told him not to do body shots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen have you gone to a party where Kim Taehyung does not do body shots?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what happened the next time you tried to hit on Jiminie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook settles back into the couch, sighing. He gestures to Wheein standing in the kitchen, and she tosses him a can of beer. \u201cLike you said, hyung, I tried to be a lot more obvious the second time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Attempt #2: when Kim Taehyung inadvertently ruins everything.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jungkook corners Jimin when he leaves dance practice. He pretends to come for Hoseok, talking to the older boy for about one minute total. Then he turns to Jimin, who stands in the back of the practice studio chugging a bottle of water, head thrown back to expose the long line of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin hyung,\u201d Jungkook says, stopping in front of him. Jimin wears sweats and a hoodie, the hood pulled up so that only a few strands of orange hair peek out, and he looks good.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Jungkook. What are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHad to talk to Hoseok hyung. You dance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin wipes sweat from his nose with the back of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m on the team with hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your baby blue moped doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not baby blue\u2014\u201d Jungkook bristles again before he realizes Jimin\u2019s only doing it to rile him up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a he? Does he have a name, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook mumbles, \u201cMaybe,\u201d and rubs the back of his head, looking away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, Jungkookie.\u201d Jimin laughs and hits his shoulder. It\u2019s almost flirty. And a nickname implies a certain level of comfort.</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins back at him. \u201cHey, hyung, wanna go to a party this weekend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tilts his head the slightest bit. He looks like a puppy, slightly confused. Then his eyes widen in understanding. Jungkook holds his breath. Is he finally, finally going to\u2014 \u201cDid Taehyung put you up to this? He\u2019s always begging me to come party with him but I never have time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did, didn\u2019t he? Damn it, Taehyung.\u201d Jimin hoists his sports bag onto his shoulder, pushing his water bottle into the outer pocket. \u201cTell him \u2018nice try.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin moves to the door. \u201cWait, hyung\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Jungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin waves and walks out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hoseok is laughing again. \u201cOh fuck, he swerved so hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo being obvious didn\u2019t really help, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, give up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Jeon Jungkook and I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014never give up. Yeah, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung has moved from body shots to making out with a girl on the table. She wanders away after a while, and Taehyung yanks a boy down by the collar instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake sure Tae gets home all right,\u201d Hoseok says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable.\u201d Hoseok sinks further into the sofa, tucking his head in Jungkook\u2019s neck and yawning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fall asleep. This is your party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me the rest.\u201d His voice slurs with sleep and alcohol both. Jungkook feels Hoseok\u2019s eyelashes flutter shut against his skin. \u201cWhat\u2019d Jiminie do the third time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Attempt #3: when Jeon Jungkook utilizes the Internet.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jungkook returns to Dream Bean with a failed project for Studio class tucked under his arm. He hadn\u2019t worked that hard on the painting, but it wasn\u2019t bad. He knew it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s why he had confronted his professor after class, demanding an explanation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you can do better, Jungkook,\u201d Professor Kim\u00a0had said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy painting was better than half the class\u2019s, and I\u2019m only one that failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>His professor was unfazed by Jungkook\u2019s outright arrogance. \u201cI don\u2019t grade you to their standards, I grade you to yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019re talented, Jungkook, but you can\u2019t scrape by on talent forever. Success requires effort, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019d left class feeling a mixture of anger and despondency. It was true he hadn\u2019t put much effort into the project. But he never needed to, so he never bothered. He almost isn\u2019t in the mood to flirt with Jimin again, yet he ends up in Dream Bean regardless.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks tired, too. Dark shadows circle his drooping eyes, and his face looks drawn like he hasn\u2019t eaten much. But when he sees Jungkook he breaks into a genuine smile, and for a brief, desperate moment, a flash of guilt spikes through Jungkook. \u201cHey, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leans on the counter and says, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you a latte.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stares. Jungkook tries not to cringe. Then Jimin bursts into laughter. His eyes curve sweetly, and the laugh is high and lively. \u201cOh, man, that\u2019s a good one. Tell me another.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s where, ordinarily, Jungkook would slink away with his tail between his legs. Pickup lines are usually a bad idea, but they\u2019ve worked before, and at this point he\u2019ll do anything. But Jimin looks so amused, the tiredness melting from his shoulders, so Jungkook says, \u201cIf you were ground coffee, you\u2019d be espresso because you\u2019re so fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs so hard he flings his whole body into it, hitting the counter with a small fist and doubling forward. When he comes back up, he wipes a tear from the corner of his eyes. Jungkook\u2019s grinning like an idiot. \u201cI needed that. I\u2019ve had a rough day. My coworker called in sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s still smiling when he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to start watching my caffeine intake, because baby you make my heart palpitate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this the guy bothering you?\u201d The deep voice behind him makes Jungkook jump. He turns around. The guy standing there has combed-back blond hair and a furrowed brow. He\u2019s dressed well, a blue button-down tucked into slender white pants. A pair of glinting aviators hangs from the collar of his shirt.</p>\n<p>Jungkook freezes, looking to Jimin, whose face brightens. \u201cHyung!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cDid you get out of class early?\u201d</p>\n<p>The guy\u2019s expression melts from intensity to affection. \u201cYeah, I did. How\u2019s work going, Jiminie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shrugs. Jungkook stands there uncomfortably. The guy has taken to ignoring him completely. \u201cAh, hyung. This is Jungkook, and he\u2019s not bothering me. He was trying to make me laugh.\u201d</p>\n<p>There it is again\u2014that flash of guilt.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, this is Namjoon hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon eyes Jungkook briefly before the guardedness fades and he smiles. He has dimples. He\u2019s attractive; Jungkook wonders if he should feel threatened. But the way he looks at Jimin seems more doting than anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, what do you guys want to drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmericano,\u201d they say in unison, then glance at each other. Namjoon laughs first.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s on me,\u201d he says, sliding cash across the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You\u2019re Jimin\u2019s friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook rubs the back of his head. He wonders if Hoseok or Taehyung would ever do something like that for a friend of his. Doubtful. Namjoon takes his to-go, leaving with a friendly wave, and Jungkook sits at the bar again. While Jimin mixes something with too much syrup, Jungkook looks at his art project. The despondency threatens to lurk once more.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a painting for class?\u201d Jimin asks, pouring espresso into the sugary drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks honestly distressed. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s lower lip curves into a cute pout. He finishes the drink and calls out for, \u201cHyejin-ssi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hyejin approaches the counter with a cheerful, \u201cThanks.\u201d As she turns away, her eyes catch on Jungkook and narrow. \u201cJeon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhn.\u201d</p>\n<p>She glares and walks off. Distracted, Jungkook doesn\u2019t notice Jimin until he pushes a blueberry muffin in a small plate across the bar.</p>\n<p>He looks at the muffin and then at Jimin. \u201cHyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cheer-up muffin, on the house. But don\u2019t tell anyone or I\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Free coffee and a free muffin. Jungkook really is spoiled. He rests his forearms on the counter and tilts his head. \u201cWhat are you doing tonight, hyung?\u201d There\u2019s no way Jimin can miss the suggestiveness of his tone or his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm? Oh, writing an essay, going to dance practice.\u201d Jimin\u2019s tone remains perfectly casual. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He mumbles some bullshit answer and watches Jimin move to the register. He drops his head on his arms and groans.</p>\n<p>Jeon Jungkook does not give up, but damn does he want to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin\u2019s a nice boy,\u201d Hoseok murmurs sleepily. \u201cIf he\u2019s not interested, leave him alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s not interested, he\u2019s just oblivious,\u201d Jungkook insists.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sighs. Taehyung stumbles against the table and some boy catches him, laughing. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to kick everyone out, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hoseok whines. \u201cThe night is young!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook rolls his eyes. He shoves Hoseok off him, who protests before curling up into a ball and falling asleep with his mouth open. Jungkook retrieves a pot from kitchen and walks around the apartment, banging it with a metal spoon. \u201cGet lost,\u201d he yells, yanking the stereo plug.</p>\n<p>People start to grumble and leave. Taehyung tries to follow someone out, but Jungkook yanks him back by his wrist\u00a0and sits him down next to Hoseok. He knows Wheein came alone, so he tucks her into Hoseok\u2019s bed and leaves a glass of water on the table. He locks the door from the inside before pulling it shut behind him. Then he checks the bathroom for any stragglers, and when he doesn\u2019t find any, he tosses a blanket over Hoseok and finds Taehyung\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t want to put it on but Jungkook shoves his sleeves through it and tugs it over his head. He\u2019s in the middle of finding Taehyung\u2019s shoes when Hoseok mumbles something.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he moves closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove yourself to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls back, troubled. \u201cBye, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wraps his arm around Taehyung\u2019s waist and leads him out. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Approximately 76.3% of questionable situations Jungkook ends up in are a direct result of Kim Taehyung.</p>\n<p>In his first year of high school, back when he barely spoke and flinched if anyone asked him a question, he scrubbed windows after classes for a whole month because of Taehyung. He had proposed that they change the snobby gym teacher\u2019s ringtone to a high-pitched keening when he wasn\u2019t in his office. Jungkook protested, imagining dire consequences, but Taehyung dragged him along regardless. He\u2019d had that special look on his face, the smile that could probably convince a person to commit murder. In the end, the teacher\u2019s phone rang while the class changed clothes in the locker room. Taehyung had burst into unrestrained laughter, but Jungkook looked so mortified the teacher caught him immediately.</p>\n<p>In his third year of high school, when he had progressed from terrified silence to the occasional in-class comment, Taehyung returned from university one weekend for what would became a rather eventful visit. Somehow he managed to persuade Jungkook that drawing dicks in chalk all over the playground at three AM was a good idea. The cops made them spend the night handcuffed to the local station\u2019s hard plastic chairs as a lesson.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But nothing was quite as bad as his first of university, when he went to his inaugural party with Taehyung and woke up the next morning on the cold, hard sidewalk. Hungover and confused, Taehyung snoring next to him, and the ground making indents on his cheek, he had looked up at what he thought was the arts building and promised himself he would never drink again. That promise didn\u2019t last very long, but he certainly never let Taehyung convince him to take another shot when he was already over his limit.</p>\n<p>So, naturally, it\u2019s entirely Kim Taehyung\u2019s fault that Jungkook finds himself standing in the middle of a daycare playground with a mass of tiny <em>fetuses</em> running and screaming around his legs.</p>\n<p>It starts with a well-aimed taunt over breakfast in the dining hall.</p>\n<p>They collect their three plates each of various breakfast items and sit in the corner by the ceiling-high window, watching the suckers with morning classes rush around toting heavy backpacks. The night before they stayed up until four in the morning playing <em>League of Legends</em>. Now Jungkook droops over his breakfast, swallowing bitter mouthfuls of dining hall coffee that doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Dream Bean\u2019s Americanos. Taehyung, as usual, is markedly more upbeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I had class with Jimin yesterday.\u201d Taehyung is the physical embodiment of the smirking emoji.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jungkook stabs at his rice, knowing exactly where this is going.</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked him about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, just said you\u2019d mentioned him and how much you liked the coffee at Dream Bean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook narrows his eyes suspiciously. \u201cIs that all you said?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung waves away the question with a careless hand. \u201cMaybe a few other things. Anyway, he seems to be under the impression that I\u2019m the one who made you ask him to a party.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s scowl deepens.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill hasn\u2019t taken the hint, has he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, he must be really oblivious. Or.\u201d One dark eyebrow quirks, the side of his mouth lifting up. \u201cHe\u2019s just really, really not into you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flushes, kicking Taehyung\u2019s shin under the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Taehyung takes a smug sip of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty obvious you\u2019re gonna be doing my laundry for four months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to get everything extra dirty for you.\u201d He winks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I can pick you up and slam you into this table right now, right?\u201d Jungkook makes sure to flex his muscles as he speaks. Taehyung weighs just about nothing. When Jungkook loses at Mario Kart, he throws Taehyung across the room for revenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cKinky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose,\u201d Jungkook growls, shoving an angry glob of rice in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Taehyung leans his chin in his hand and pouts patronizingly. \u201cGuess you\u2019re still little Kookie with no game, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stands, a rush of warmth flooding to his face. He leans across the table to grab Taehyung\u2019s collar, but Taehyung is too quick. He leaps up, grabs his bag, and runs for the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a good day, Jungkookie!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know where you sleep, you sack of shit!\u201d he shouts back.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why he braves Dream Bean again that afternoon, hoping Jimin\u2019s working that day. He catches him just as he\u2019s pulling off his apron and hat, fluffing out his orange hair and slinging a thin backpack over one shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d he says with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d Jungkook stops by the waist-high swinging door that leads behind the counter, Jimin on the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta get to volunteering. At the daycare.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt HSL?\u201d he says, and then flinches. He shouldn\u2019t know that. He only knows that because Hoseok told him.</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks. \u201cYeah. You know it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you volunteer there, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starting,\u201d he blurts before he can stop himself. \u201cNext week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin brightens. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other volunteers my age.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods, gaining confidence. \u201cI\u2019m kind of nervous. I\u2019ve never worked with kids before and the, uh, supervisor made it seem pretty strict.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not bad at all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think you could tell me a little bit about it? I know you have to get going, but maybe we could trade numbers?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls out his phone immediately, swapping with Jungkook. \u201cText me with any questions you have. You\u2019re gonna love it there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He watches Jimin go with a surge of triumph. Take that, Taehyung. Jimin\u2019s number and a permanent way to see him all in one go.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you getting anything?\u201d The girl at the counter calls over, slightly irritated.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d he says, and runs out with a grin.</p>\n<p>Halfway home he realizes that he has one week to find a way to apply, land an acceptance, and begin volunteering. At a daycare. With children. Living, breathing children around whom he has to be lively and patient, all the while trying to convince the insusceptible Jimin to sleep with him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is monumentally fucked.</p>\n<p>He takes his moped to HSL during a time he knows Taehyung and Jimin have class together. Parking Stark outside, he enters through the swinging double doors into a bright lobby. The walls are red, the chairs yellow, and the desk blue. It looks like preschool.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d The long-haired girl at the desk asks. She seems friendly.</p>\n<p>He glances at her nametag before bowing politely. \u201cHello, Yongsun-ssi.\u201d He shoots her a winning smile. \u201cI was wondering how to become a volunteer here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust fill out one of these forms.\u201d She pulls a three page packet from under the desk and hands it to him. \u201cSomeone will review it and call you in for a quick interview. It won\u2019t be anything major since you\u2019re only working as a volunteer.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have time to wait for an interview. \u201cMind if I just fill it out right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>She hands him a pen, and he takes a seat in one of the uncomfortable yellow chairs. He races through the form in under ten minutes, jotting down bullshit like <em>I want to volunteer so I can learn about kids and be a better hyung to my cousins </em>and <em>I\u2019m really hardworking and responsible. </em>A part of him wonders if he laid it on too thick when he hands the form back to Yongsun.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone will contact you within a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I was wondering.\u201d He constructs his tone into one light and sweet. \u201cIs there any way I could meet with someone right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her brow furrows, ready to deny him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand if it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m sure everyone\u2019s so busy. But I\u2019m really looking forward to working here, and I just want to get started as soon as possible, if you\u2019ll have me.\u201d Her face melts but still doesn\u2019t look very convinced. \u201cI completely get it if that can\u2019t happen. But I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could help me out.\u201d He lets his voice drop off at the end, eyes wide and imploring. She flushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I can work something out. Hold on.\u201d</p>\n<p>She disappears down the long hallway to the side where crayon artwork covers the walls. Jungkook drums his fingers on the desk and taps his foot. Yongsun returns fifteen minutes later, leading an older woman with a stern expression. He quakes inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re interested in volunteering?\u201d she says curtly.</p>\n<p>He bows. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t usually do these kinds of things in one visit. I haven\u2019t even looked at your application yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He figures it\u2019s best not to try sugarcoating, so he leaves it at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>She takes him into her office, a small one with pictures of children on her wooden desk. He sits through a few basic questions, like his major and experience and what he\u2019d do with a crying kid. He channels his inner Taehyung. He\u2019s the one who got him into this mess, but Taehyung is also absolute magic with kids.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take as long as he expected. Half an hour later, she shows him out with an instructional packet on daycare volunteering and a promise that he can start in one week exactly, at the very same time Jimin will be there, too. Jungkook rides Stark all the way home with a massive grin on his face.</p>\n<p>Take that, Kim Taehyung.</p>\n<p>He texts Jimin a few times over the week with random questions. Jimin always responds promptly and with three emojis minimum, but he never texts Jungkook first. Jungkook isn\u2019t worried. His first day of volunteering arrives, and he checks his outfit in the mirror three times over. The supervisor asked that he dress well, so he wears a checked button-down tucked into dark pants. He fixes his hair to look like a Nice Boy and puts on a wristwatch for good measure.</p>\n<p>Taehyung smacks his butt as he passes by. \u201cLooking good. Where are you going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVolunteering,\u201d Jungkook says smugly. \u201cAt the daycare. With Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of looking appropriately disappointed that Jungkook is now clearly winning, Taehyung looks confused. \u201cYou\u2019re volunteering? At a daycare?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were trying to get Jimin to sleep with you, not fall in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPutting up with screaming kids every week seems like a little much just for sex, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook snorts. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything to avoid your disgusting laundry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t see Jimin when he gets there. They put him in a classroom with a number of large round tables occupied by curious five-year-olds. The walls are lined with smaller bookshelves for the kids and larger ones full of teachers\u2019 supplies. A play area by the windows, surrounded by cubbies with their bags and jackets, has a comfy couch and a colorful rug. All the games are stored neatly in a room to the side.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t stay so organized for long. He spends the first hour running back and forth wiping the remnants of snack time off tables, handing out crayons, and answering questions like <em>how come you have so many ear piercings, hyung</em>? One little girl asks if he\u2019ll play an imaginary game of basketball with her, and he complies, pretending to shoot hoops and dodge around her tiny arms. But then the teacher pulls him aside and says rather sternly, as if he\u2019s supposed to know this one day in, that the kids are not allowed to play games until they\u2019ve finished their homework. Jungkook thinks that\u2019s a stupid rule. This is a daycare, not a school.</p>\n<p>By the time the teacher calls for a break, Jungkook is regretting his decision immensely. Taehyung\u2019s laundry might be better than this. He follows the class to the playground behind the building and hopes running freely will tire them out.\u00a0 A large tree near the mini basketball court offers solace, where he remains close enough to check on anyone if they fall but far enough that their screams don\u2019t assault his skull so much. When someone taps his shoulder, he\u2019s discreetly scrolling through Twitter on his phone at a perfectly situated angle so that the teacher can\u2019t see him.</p>\n<p>He jumps, fumbling his phone. Catching it before he drops it, he spins around, an excuse on the tip of his tongue. But it\u2019s just Jimin, grinning up at him. He looks extra small in a flat pair of shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlacking on the job, Jungkook-ssi?\u201d he teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook sniffs. He knows Jimin is joking, but it riles him up anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the first day?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \u201cMy teacher\u2019s kind of a hard ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did they put you with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook gestures to the man sitting on a bench by the swing set. \u201cI forgot his name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin rolls his eyes. \u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m with Bom noona.\u201d He points to a pretty, dark-haired woman playing a squealing game of tag with a few of the younger kids. \u201cBut they\u2019re switching me to your class after break, actually. She doesn\u2019t have as many kids today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook tries to look disinterested. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey kind of just move you around to whoever needs it the most.\u201d Jimin leans on the tree beside Jungkook, hands behind his back. The height difference is monumental when he slouches like that. Jungkook could tuck him under his arm if he wanted to. Not that he does. \u201cYou clean up nicely, Mr. Timberlands-and-Sweats.\u201d Jimin tugs on the cuff of Jungkook\u2019s button-down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, too.\u201d Jimin\u2019s more than okay. Jimin looks like he descended from the Heavens in slacks that hug the curve of his ass and a slender dress shirt shaped to his chest.</p>\n<p>The arrival of Yeonjoo, the girl from before, interrupts any offended answer Jimin might have. She skids to a stop in front of Jungkook with a basketball clutched in both arms. \u201cJungkook oppa can you help me dunk I\u2019m not tall enough but I really want to dunk\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook likes Yeonjoo. She stuck her tongue out at the teacher when he pulled Jungkook aside for scolding. So he grabs her by the waist mid-sentence, lifts her up, and breaks into a run so fast she shrieks. \u201cYeonjoo, HSL\u2019s star player, about to make a shot that will go down in history,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t need to jump to reach the rim of the mini basketball hoop, but he pretends to anyway. She grabs the rim to drop the ball in. It whooshes through, and she cheers.</p>\n<p>Jungkook sets her down carefully. She holds her hand up for a high-five. He complies, grinning, then returns to the tree. Jimin watches him approach, a quiet smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook rubs the back of his head, a hint of embarrassment coloring his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cCute,\u201d Jimin says.</p>\n<p>Jimin joins his classroom when break ends. The teacher is much friendlier to him than Jungkook. Jungkook would be affronted, but he realizes it\u2019s kind of impossible to be mean to Jimin. Helping the kids with homework occupies most of their time until they\u2019re allowed to switch to playing with puzzles and paint instead. Then Jungkook and Jimin stand off to the side while the teacher disappears into his office.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin hyung.\u201d One of the boys raises his hand. \u201cCan I have the Pororo coloring book?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns to the bookshelf next to them and scans it. He cranes his neck, peering at the very top shelf. Jungkook can see it resting on top of the bookshelf rather than in it, where someone must have carelessly tossed it. He considers offering help but waits to see if Jimin will ask. He doesn\u2019t; he hoists himself up on his tiptoes and reaches for it. His fingers barely brush the top edge of the shelf. Jungkook\u2019s fruitless efforts to hide a smile fall through.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d Jungkook says, unable to keep the amusement from his tone.</p>\n<p>Jimin shoots him a side-eyed glance. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he says primly, and reaches again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk Jungkook hyung to get it!\u201d The boy calls. \u201cHe\u2019s so tall.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time Jungkook can\u2019t fight the chuckle. \u201cYeah, hyung, I\u2019m so tall. Let me try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we weren\u2019t around kids,\u201d Jimin says through gritted teeth. \u201cI\u2019d whoop your\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook hushes him theatrically. \u201cThink of the <em>children</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin vainly tries for the book again. He\u2019s close, his fingers just centimeters from grabbing it. Jungkook shifts to stand behind him, near enough that his chest presses into Jimin\u2019s warm back. He feels Jimin stiffen, hears the sharp intake of breath. Then he reaches up and retrieves the book with ease.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he murmurs in Jimin\u2019s ear, resting his hand on his waist for the briefest of seconds before pulling away. \u201cHere you go, kid.\u201d He deposits the book in front of the boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name\u2019s not \u2018kid,\u2019\u201d he insists.</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t like him. He tried to take the basketball away from Yeonjoo during break. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He shoots a surreptitious glance in Jimin\u2019s direction, who looks vaguely flustered. An opportunity at last; he sidles up to Jimin\u2019s side and says, \u201cWanna get coffee after this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would.\u201d Jimin really does sound regretful. \u201cBut I have to write a paper and solve equations for math and watch this English movie and\u2014yeah.\u201d But hesitantly, he suggests, \u201cYou could come over. We could, um, study together. If you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook very carefully schools his expression into one of absolute indifference. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s how Jungkook ends up in Jimin\u2019s one-bedroom apartment, alone, at night, thrumming with anticipation. An untidy pile of open books and paper litter the floor between them, but it\u2019s not so large an obstacle. Jungkook pretends to study vocabulary for art history, but really he watches Jimin scribble numbers onto paper with his tongue peeking from the corner of his pursed lips. After a while Jimin rolls over onto his back, spreading his arms dramatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate math,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you studying to be an English teacher? Why are you taking math?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be certified to teach math, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jungkook doesn\u2019t mask the disgust.</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs. \u201cI think it\u2019d be cool to teach different things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why math? Why not Korean? Or History?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno. Math\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. But I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. You picked English.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnglish is hard,\u201d Jimin says, as if Jungkook doesn\u2019t know. \u201cBut Namjoon hyung is really good at English. He helps me practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jungkook remembers the tall, handsome guy who made Jimin smile so brightly and feels a little bitter.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my roommate, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a roommate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances around him with new eyes, at the small living room separated from an even smaller kitchen by a little counter, and the partially open door to the bedroom he hasn\u2019t seen. \u201cYou all share one room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cheap splitting rent three ways.\u201d Jimin tosses an arm over his eyes, relaxing onto the floor.</p>\n<p>He thinks about his own apartment, with its two decently-sized bedrooms and HD TV. From what he can see, Jimin doesn\u2019t have a television. The apartment contains little in the way of adornment, no more than one threadbare armchair and a broken couch. Jungkook and Taehyung hardly use the kitchen, but appliances litter their counter; Jimin doesn\u2019t even have microwave. \u201cYou pay for rent on your own?\u201d Before Jungkook first moved in, he had complained to his parents for not finding him an apartment of his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents are kind of in a rough spot right now. So I take care of myself. Send home what I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok had said Jimin sent money home to his family, but Jungkook hadn\u2019t really thought about it until now. \u201cThat\u2019s why you work two jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d Jimin flips over onto his stomach, propping himself on his elbows. He looks like he desperately wants Jungkook to believe him. \u201cI\u2019m happy to help my family. I just wish I could do more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook wonders if he would be so understanding in Jimin\u2019s position.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you? Have you always wanted to do art?\u201d Jimin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess. I\u2019ve always been good at it, so it made sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I see some of your work sometime?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have some pictures on my phone. I can show you.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know why he suddenly feels embarrassed. \u201cUm, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would love that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He maneuvers around the homework spread out between them to flop down on his stomach next to Jimin, shoulder-to-shoulder. Swiping quickly through a few drunken pictures of Taehyung dancing on a table that make Jimin giggle, he stops on a photo of a painting he did a few months ago. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for class or anything. The cherry blossoms looked pretty. It\u2019s not that good, it was just for fun\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Jimin breathes, taking his phone to zoom in. He passes over every inch of it with such awed scrutiny that Jungkook fidgets. \u201cShow me more.\u201d</p>\n<p>So he swipes through a few more, and Jimin gazes at each one with wide-eyed wonder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Jungkookie.\u201d He looks up. \u201cThese are the prettiest paintings I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes flicker to Jimin\u2019s lips. They\u2019re so close he would only have to lean in a little to kiss him, noses brushing, shoulders bumping. He could draw his thumb along Jimin\u2019s smooth cheek, bring him closer if he wanted. Run his hands through the soft orange hair he\u2019s admired for weeks.</p>\n<p>The door opens with an unceremonious bang.</p>\n<p>Jungkook jerks back. Jimin pushes himself into a sitting position, peeking around the couch to see the newcomer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi hyung!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Jiminie. Whose shoes are these?\u201d A rough voice calls back. Jungkook freezes. Yoongi hyung. Min Yoongi, notorious photography graduate student, is Jimin\u2019s roommate. He hears shuffling before Yoongi steps into view. Their eyes lock onto each other, and Yoongi\u2019s narrow. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook imagined Yoongi as an imposing presence, cocky and fearless. The real Yoongi is small, about the same height as Jimin, with grapefruit-colored hair and bags under his eyes. Thin legs show through his torn skinny jeans, and the jacket he wears practically engulfs him. He has delicate features, a small nose and pretty lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi hyung, this is Jungkook. He\u2019s an art student, too. Jungkook, this is Yoongi hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stands to bow, still shell-shocked. He had known they were friends, but roommates?</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks him up and down, unimpressed. He may be small, but he\u2019s still just as intimidating as Jungkook expected. \u201cJeon Jungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d His eyes narrow further, if that\u2019s even possible. \u201cYou\u2019re that party boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou come into Professor Choi\u2019s class late every day. He always complains about you in the break room.\u201d At Jungkook\u2019s confusion, he adds, \u201cI\u2019m his assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Choi called me a party boy?\u201d He grins. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin kicks the back of his leg from where he still sits on the ground. \u201cGoing to class late is rude. You\u2019re so talented, don\u2019t waste it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut his class is on a <em>Friday</em>. The best parties are Thursday nights.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClass isn\u2019t until four in the afternoon. Still hungover by then?\u201d Jungkook makes a face, and Yoongi smirks. He tosses his bag on a stool by the counter. \u201cJiminie, did you eat dinner? Should I order something? Hyung\u2019s treat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already ate. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Jimin looks down at his hands when he lies. Jungkook has been with him since they left volunteering, and he knows Jimin hasn\u2019t eaten anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStudying.\u201d He points at their books.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Yoongi fixes his gaze on Jungkook. \u201cStudying, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares back. Yoongi\u2019s expressions tells him the older does not have much faith in Jungkook\u2019s intentions. Even though he\u2019s right, Jungkook feels insulted. Yoongi ducks into the kitchen and Jungkook returns to the ground by Jimin\u2019s side, pulling over his book so he can prove that he really is doing work. A few minutes later, Yoongi emerges with a bottle of beer. He plops down on the armchair directly opposite them, pops the cap, and relaxes back, one foot tapping rhythmically.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no TV in the room. Yoongi didn\u2019t bring any books or a laptop. He just sits there and drinks his beer and stares at his phone. Jungkook had hoped he would retreat into the bedroom, but it looks like he has no plans of leaving Jungkook alone to make his move.</p>\n<p>Yoongi catches his stare and raises an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me. Keep on <em>studying</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s head drops dejectedly back to his book. If he didn\u2019t have enough obstacles already, now he has to deal with an overprotective roommate, too.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s knee jostles up and down with the force of his tapping foot. He slouches back in the hard wooden chair, then sits upright. His fingers drum against the mahogany desk, then poke at a few sheets of laminated paper. It\u2019s a messy desk, empty water bottles surrounding the computer and piles of haphazard sheets. The gold nameplate reads <em>Kim Seokjin</em>, and smaller beneath it, <em>Arts Department</em>. A little hourglass sits in the corner. Jungkook watches the sand trickle down. His foot taps quicker.</p>\n<p>The door bursts open. Professor Kim speeds in, collapsing into his large desk chair, slightly out of breath. He loosens his tie. Even though his hair is windswept and his cheeks flushed, he still looks devastatingly handsome.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry to keep you waiting. A student spilled a can of paint near the fashion studio.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. He bites the corner of his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know why I asked to see you today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like my sketch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about what I like or dislike. You know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs.</p>\n<p>Professor Kim runs a hand through his dark hair. \u201cRemember what I told you last time? About effort?\u201d</p>\n<p>He remembers failing a perfectly good studio project. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying hard enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook.\u201d From a folder by his desk, Professor Kim retrieves the sketch Jungkook turned in as a plan for his next project. He places it between them like it\u2019s supposed to mean something. \u201cYou could do this with your eyes closed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s shitty?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <em>shitty</em>. It\u2019s a pretty good draft, technically speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem is you have so much potential and you\u2019re wasting it. Where\u2019s the heart? There\u2019s nothing uniquely Jungkook about this idea at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that\u2019s supposed to mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you studying art?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim looks disappointed. He rests his arms on the desk and tilts his head. The gentleness in his gaze makes Jungkook feel guilty. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d He clenches a hand around his knee, forcing his foot to stop tapping. \u201cWhat am I supposed to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to attack you right now. Don\u2019t feel pressured, all right? I just want to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hesitates. \u201cAll right.\u201d His hand unclenches. He lets his shoulders drop.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did your parents feel when you told them you wanted to study art?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t like it at first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you convinced them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat must have been hard. Why didn\u2019t you do something they would have been happy with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my life. I don\u2019t wanna do what they want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo art is what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen prove it. You might have been able to half-ass your way through life until now, but not my class. I want to see you put effort into my projects. Create something that matters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks down at his feet, chewing the insides of his cheeks. His hand clenches into a fist again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get anywhere if you just do enough to pass. Art is about more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I go now?\u201d He finally brings himself to meet his professor\u2019s gaze, unable to keep the sullenness from his tone when he does.</p>\n<p>Professor Kim sighs. \u201cDon\u2019t come to class late tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slings his backpack over one shoulder, tucks his large canvas painting under his arm, and leaves. Eyes locked on his feet, he bumps into more than one pair of shoulders on the way out. The project under his arm is for a different class. A paper attached to the back of the canvas boasts stellar marks. That morning he had also received the grade for an art history exam. He did pretty well considering he hadn\u2019t studied at all. If he had, maybe he would have gotten perfect marks.</p>\n<p>But Jungkook doesn\u2019t need perfect marks. He\u2019s doing all right the way he is, he\u2019s always done all right. He doesn\u2019t understand why Professor Kim wants more.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice startles him from his reverie. He looks up, shielding his eyes from the sun. Somehow, in his distraction, he has walked all the way to the library. Jimin bounces down the steps of the old stone building, waving. In cuffed jeans and sunglasses, he looks as good as always. One step behind him walk Namjoon and Yoongi. The latter has on a facemask and a hat pulled low over his eyes, a vitamin drink clutched tightly in hand.</p>\n<p>Jimin hops to a stop in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to volunteering this week, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. You wanna study again after?\u201d He pointedly glances at Yoongi as he and Namjoon come up behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jimin says, oblivious.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, right?\u201d Namjoon nods in greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cParty boy,\u201d says Yoongi, with a jerk of his head that might count as <em>hello</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that another painting?\u201d Jimin points at the canvas. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p>\n<p>A sudden wave of discomfort filters through him. He pulls back just before Jimin reaches for it. \u201cIt\u2019s not done,\u201d he lies. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin had looked at his paintings with such awe, called him talented. But Jungkook hadn\u2019t spent more than a night on this one. He doesn\u2019t want Jimin to see that.</p>\n<p>Professor Kim must be getting to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Jimin is unfazed. \u201cShow me when it\u2019s done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna come to the dining hall with us for lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances at Yoongi and Namjoon, then back at Jimin. It\u2019s an opportunity, and he\u2019s always looking for opportunities. But suddenly this feels like a stupid game. \u201cNah, I gotta get somewhere. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns away rather abruptly. On his way home, he drops the painting in a dumpster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s foot connects with Jungkook\u2019s bedframe in rhythmic jolts. Jungkook lies sprawled on his stomach, face buried in his pillow. At first the thumping was irritating, but now it\u2019s almost relaxing. He could fall asleep to the bed\u2019s rocking if it weren\u2019t for Taehyung\u2019s annoying voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook. Jungkookie. Kookie. Jeon. Jeon Jungkook. Jungkook-ah. Little Kookie.\u201d He kicks the bed with every variation.</p>\n<p>For a moment Jungkook lies there, wondering if it might be possible to tune him out. His voice increases in pitch and Jungkook abandons the idea. He cranes his neck to look at Taehyung, resting his cheek on the pillow, one eye mashed shut. Taehyung sits on top of Jungkook\u2019s desk, at perfect level to kick the bed with each swing of his foot. A pile of papers lie crumpled under his butt.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie, Jungkookie, Jeon Jungkookie,\u201d Taehyung continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been lying in bed all day. I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Jimin reject you? Are you moping?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook twists around to snatch a spare pillow and fling it. He\u2019s close enough that it slams right into Taehyung\u2019s face. Taehyung splutters, clutching the offending pillow, and kicks the bed hard enough that the headboard slams into the wall.</p>\n<p>Despite the explosive reaction, Taehyung says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Wanna talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing\u2019s the matter.\u201d And that\u2019s the thing\u2014nothing is. He\u2019s just pissed. He doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson hyung is throwing a party tonight. We should go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really wanna go anywhere today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Jimin won\u2019t bite, find someone else. You know Donghyuk will probably be there, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Jimin,\u201d Jungkook insists, but the prospect of seeing Donghyuk from last year\u2019s studio class is enticing. Donghyuk likes leather. He\u2019ll probably show up with his collarbones on display in a white t-shirt under a black leather jacket, with that smoldering gaze he reserves for party nights\u2014Jungkook sits up.</p>\n<p>Taehyung snorts. \u201cMention Donghyuk once and your dick\u2019s already twitching.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not as bad as you when someone mentions Suwoong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay but Suwoong is honestly the best lay I\u2019ve ever had\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat should I wear?\u201d Jungkook leaps out of bed in one smooth bound and tugs open his wardrobe door. \u201cDonghyuk\u2019s gonna wear leather so I shouldn\u2019t wear leather, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should definitely wear leather. I think he has a kink.\u201d Taehyung slides off the desk and into Jungkook\u2019s bed, wrapping his long limbs around all his pillows like an octopus. \u201cWear those leather pants that make your ass look good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy ass always looks good,\u201d Jungkook says, but he digs out the pants anyway.</p>\n<p>They arrive at the party fashionably late, as always. Jackson has a much larger apartment than Hoseok, but he also shares it with three other guys. The place is packed, already reeking of alcohol and sweat. Jungkook finds Hoseok in the crowd and asks him to keep an eye on Taehyung tonight. He doesn\u2019t try looking for Donghyuk yet. Instead he takes to the center of the living room and dances among the swaying bodies. It\u2019s not long before hands slide around his waist, burning through the thin material of his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Donghyuk\u2019s light voice says into his hair, a moment before his teeth scrape against Jungkook\u2019s earlobe, catching on his earring. His calloused hands slip under the hem of Jungkook\u2019s shirt to trace his hipbones.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s not much talking after that. They go to Donghyuk\u2019s apartment, like they always do. The sex is good, like it always is. So good that Jungkook falls asleep in Donghyuk\u2019s bed even though he fully intends on leaving before morning.</p>\n<p>When he wakes up, the sun through Donghyuk\u2019s window stings his eyes. He flings an arm over his face, groaning. Then he sits up, stretching until his back cracks, and leans over the side of the bed to remove his phone from his discarded jacket pocket. He has three text messages from Taehyung, all of which contain nothing but winking emojis. The time on his lockscreen reads 2:15.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>He catapults out of bed, shoving one leg into his pants and searching for his shirt at the same time. He has already shimmied into his pants when he remembers underwear. He takes them off, finds his underwear, then realizes he can\u2019t arrive at a fucking daycare in leather pants so tight they show off the muscles of his thighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, again. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>He yanks Donghyuk\u2019s closet door open and grabs a nice blue polo and a pair of khakis that look like they\u2019ll probably fit him. Donghyuk\u2019s shorter, so he cuffs the ends of the pants until it isn\u2019t noticeable.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Donghyuk mumbles. He props himself up on one elbow, sheets tangled around his trim waist. Purpling bruises line his ribcage.</p>\n<p>\u201cForgot I have volunteering. I\u2019ll bring your clothes back later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool,\u201d he says, and face-plants back onto his pillow.</p>\n<p>Jungkook finger-brushes his teeth, combs a hand through his hair, and runs out of the building. He doesn\u2019t bother stopping for his moped, jogging all the way to the daycare instead. Yongsun at the front desk sends him straight to Bom\u2019s classroom, where Jimin\u2019s already handing out crayons. Some of that guilt flares with Jimin\u2019s bright smile and little wave. It\u2019s nothing like it at all, but for some reason Jungkook kind of feels like he cheated on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk until break. Jimin meets him under the tree by the basketball court like last time. He rests back against the trunk, right next to where Jungkook\u2019s hand leans.</p>\n<p>\u201cLate night?\u201d Jimin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin raises his brows, gaze flickering to Jungkook\u2019s neck. Jungkook\u2019s hand flies up, pressing against tender skin, and realizes he must have a hickey.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Kids don\u2019t know what hickeys are. They probably think you fell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still, he shifts the collar of Donghyuk\u2019s polo around in the hopes of hiding it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that definitely doesn\u2019t look like your outfit.\u201d Jimin\u2019s tone is neutral, careful, but something in his eyes speaks of distance. For a brief, desperate moment, Jungkook wonders if Jimin is jealous.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jungkook glances down at himself. Even though it\u2019s obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so not your size.\u201d There\u2019s no judgement in his voice, just curiosity when he asks, \u201cDo you really party as much as everyone says?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho says?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI party as much as Hoseok does, if that helps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo as much as everyone says.\u201d Jimin looks away, fiddling with the hem of his dress shirt. \u201cIs it fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook wonders if he\u2019s imagining the longing in Jimin\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. A way to let loose, no strings attached.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not imagining it. \u201cYou don\u2019t go out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even once in a while?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could, I just\u2014I dunno. I\u2019m so used to not having fun that even when I\u2019m free I just sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really reject anyone who\u2019s interested in you, like everyone says?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes flicker up to meet his, wide, a deer caught in headlights. \u201cWho says?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone.\u201d Jungkook smirks, and Jimin flushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t have time. For relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t do relationships, either. Not my thing. Like I said\u2014I like it when there\u2019s no strings attached.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you just fuck around,\u201d Jimin says wryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do that, either?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really my thing.\u201d Jimin bites the corner of his plump lower lip. \u201cNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, obviously,\u201d he says suddenly. \u201cI just don\u2019t. Not lately, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not lately doesn\u2019t mean not ever. Jungkook allows himself to hope. \u201cCome on, no friends with benefits? No one night stands?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook, why are you so interested in my sex life?\u201d Mirth dances in his gaze, replacing the previous discomfort.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe because I want to be part of it.\u201d Unconsciously his voice lowers to a murmur. He shifts slightly so he\u2019s facing Jimin, hand still braced against the tree by his head.</p>\n<p>Jimin snorts. \u201cHa, ha. Very funny. Honestly, where do you come up this stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you are.\u201d He rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Yeonjoo fell.\u201d Jimin pushes him away, small hand pressing briefly against his chest, and runs onto the basketball court without a backwards glance.</p>\n<p>Yeonjoo sits in the middle of the blacktop, sobbing. Jungkook starts toward them. Jimin squats in front of her, lips forming words Jungkook can\u2019t hear. He looks tiny sitting like that. Yeonjoo\u2019s fine, he can tell, just startled. Jimin wipes tears from her round cheeks with his thumbs, an expression so tender on his face that Jungkook falters. When he helps her to her feet, she wraps her arms around his leg. His hands curl through her hair, and Jungkook draws close enough to listen.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d he coos. \u201cYou\u2019re fine. You want to sit out?\u201d</p>\n<p>She mumbles something incoherent. Jungkook comes up next to them. \u201cYeonjoo, you gotta win the game. You\u2019re the star player, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>She sniffs, pulling her head back to look at Jungkook skeptically. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStar players keep going even when they\u2019re hurt. Shows how strong they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she finally says, letting go of Jimin. Jungkook holds out his hand for a high five and she delivers, a smile spreading across her face.</p>\n<p>Jimin and Jungkook jog off the blacktop as the game resumes. Jimin doesn\u2019t look at him, even when he says his name. \u201cI forgot to ask Bom noona something,\u201d he says, and walks away.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know if Jimin\u2019s upset because of what Jungkook said or if it\u2019s something else. Jimin stands with Bom for the rest of break. Jungkook stays by the tree helplessly, shooting periodic glances at them. He\u2019s has never been this unsure about someone before. Never tried this hard.</p>\n<p>When they return to class, Jimin acts like he always does, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or worried. Afterward, he waits for Jungkook at the door. \u201cWe\u2019re still studying, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook says. If Jimin notices the hesitancy, he doesn\u2019t comment.</p>\n<p>Jimin fumbles with his keys when they reach his apartment. Jungkook leans against the doorjamb, watching his small hands pick through the numerous keys attached to his university lanyard. He\u2019s done nothing out of the ordinary, but Jungkook still feels as though something\u2019s wrong.</p>\n<p>He finally summons up the courage to say, \u201cEarlier, about what I said\u2014I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to pry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jungkookie,\u201d Jimin turns a smile on him, as sweet as ever. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean anything by it. It just sucks being known as this big heartbreaker, you know? It\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d He knows that besides Taehyung, he\u2019s never met anyone as unlikely to willingly break someone\u2019s heart as Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate rejecting people,\u201d Jimin says, sorting through the keys with sudden vehemence. \u201cI don\u2019t get why anyone even likes me. It\u2019s like\u2014it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s this fucking challenge for people, now, because everyone in my major knows I don\u2019t date and\u2014\u201d He finds the right key, jams it toward the keyhole and misses. \u201cI wanna be with someone, too, you know? I just, I have to volunteer or else I won\u2019t have any experience and English is so hard to learn and I work two jobs because my dad gets sick sometimes and has to take off days and they need me to send money and I\u2019m just so tired sometimes I can\u2019t even think straight\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jungkook murmurs. He rests his hand on top of Jimin\u2019s, gently taking the keys from his trembling fingers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to justify yourself to me. Or anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sags against Jungkook\u2019s side, so suddenly that at first Jungkook doesn\u2019t react. Then he carefully slips his arm around Jimin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThanks, Kookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook unlocks the door. Once they\u2019re inside, Jimin pulls away and straightens. He braces himself visibly, as if he\u2019s giving himself the strength to keep going. Jungkook watches his mouth change from a pout to a line and his forehead crease.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I dunno why I\u2019m acting like this.\u201d Before Jungkook can answer, he drags him to the living room and drops his backpack on the floor. \u201cLet\u2019s study. I have to write a paper before work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re working tonight?\u201d He pauses at the sudden realization. Jimin doesn\u2019t notice, making himself comfortable among a pile of cushions on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cShift at Dream Bean starts at ten today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt ends at two.\u201d He pulls a notebook from his bag, then seems to realize that Jungkook hasn\u2019t moved. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel about fried chicken?\u201d he blurts, sitting down in front of Jimin and digging his phone out of his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cFried chicken?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d He rubs his stomach pointedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! I didn\u2019t even offer you anything. I can see what we have in the fridge\u2014\u201d he starts to get up, but Jungkook grabs his wrist and yanks him back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I just really feel like fried chicken today. And some beer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks uncomfortable. \u201cAll right. It\u2019s my treat, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pay. I\u2019m the hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Jungkook dials the number, but Jimin snatches his phone away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m paying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying.\u201d He reaches across Jimin\u2019s body to where he holds the phone in the air. His arms are considerably longer, so he wrestles it away easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPark Jimin. Hyung,\u201d he adds as an afterthought. \u201cYou always give me free muffins when I come to Dream Bean. I owe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He means it. He knows Jimin would hate to be pitied, and that\u2019s not why he\u2019s doing it. Jungkook owes Jimin. For Jimin\u2019s kindness, for his generous laugh and his free muffins. For making a shitty, childish bet over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t do it because I expect payback.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. But it\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what gets Jimin to settle down and let Jungkook order, although he pouts for the entire fifteen minutes it takes the delivery guy to arrive. Jungkook fetches the chicken and beer from the apartment lobby. They eat on the floor alongside their books, watching an episode of <em>Running Man</em> on Jungkook\u2019s phone. Namjoon arrives halfway through.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you dressed like that?\u201d He asks Jungkook, stealing a chicken leg from Jimin\u2019s box.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t his clothes,\u201d Jimin says, and giggles. Jungkook flushes and hits his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Namjoon rolls his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p>\n<p>They return to work eventually, and Namjoon joins them with his own hefty textbooks. From the look of them, he\u2019s studying philosophy. Jungkook opens to a fresh sheet of his sketchbook and tries to rethink the project for Professor Kim\u2019s class. He draws out a few things, tears out the sheet, and crumples it up. He does this five times because \u201ccourage\u201d is an awfully vague theme for an art project, and nothing he drafts feels right when Professor Kim\u2019s disappointed voice plays on a loop in his head.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in between frustrated determination and hopelessness, Jungkook glances at Jimin. He droops over his laptop and notebook, fingers clutched loosely around a pencil. His eyes flutter shut, mouth open, as his chin drops to his chest. He jerks back up, eyes still closed. With those smooth, round cheeks and full lips, he looks awfully young. His head droops again before he catches himself, opening his eyes slowly. With a small hand, he rubs his nose and hides a yawn. It\u2019s only six in the evening. Jimin has hours ahead of him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks down at his crushed sheets of paper and empty sketchbook. Professor Kim wants him to put in effort. It\u2019s not so bad, really. It\u2019s just one project. If Jimin can do everything he does and still smile then Jungkook can try hard for one project.</p>\n<p>When he returns to his building that night, it\u2019s with a dejected air.</p>\n<p>\u201cBad day, Jeon?\u201d Hyejin says, barely glancing up from her ever-present comic.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of your business, Ahn,\u201d he answers, because it\u2019s expected.</p>\n<p>He heads straight for Taehyung\u2019s room. Taehyung sits cross-legged in bed, glasses perched on the bridge of his nose, switching his attention between three children\u2019s books and a sheet of paper covered in diagrams.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says without looking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jungkook untucks Donghyuk\u2019s polo and loosens the collar.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m writing a paper on themes of poverty in popular children\u2019s books and how they affect childhood development.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shifts one of the books aside so he can make room for himself. He plops onto his stomach, rests his head on Taehyung\u2019s knee, and closes his eyes. Taehyung\u2019s hand strokes through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jungkookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVolunteering\u2019s tiring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung stays quiet. He brushes Jungkook\u2019s bangs from his forehead. Jungkook thinks he could fall asleep like this. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d Taehyung finally says. \u201cJust for sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s said that before. This time it resonates. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Jungkook was a first year in high school his classmates would laugh at how he stuttered when someone spoke to him. The laughter used to echo in his mind when it got too quiet. Sometimes it still does. For half the year the laughter followed him into the bathrooms where it turned cruel and the older boys threw fists to accompany it, until Taehyung figured out what was happening and started following him everywhere to keep him safe.</p>\n<p>From his first year of high school to his last, he was in love with a boy who thought it was funny when he finally confessed a day before graduation. Taehyung still doesn\u2019t know about that. He had left for university by then, and Jungkook had learned how to stand up for himself. He\u2019d gotten better at it, but hearing the condescending laughter of someone who had taken residence in his heart for four years made him feel small again, like he was still the scrawny little boy who got through every day only because he had Taehyung by his side.</p>\n<p>Hoseok\u2019s wrong; Jungkook does have something to prove.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, Jungkook realizes how stupid it is to think he\u2019s got Jimin all figured out.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t really think that, knows that there\u2019s more to Jimin than he understands. Because Jimin\u2019s a person and people have layers. But a part of him still thinks he\u2019s got Jimin all figured out. Jimin\u2019s a Nice Boy. Jungkook isn\u2019t. It\u2019s simple enough.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Enter KIM BOBBY. </em>\n</p>\n<p>It only takes five meetings for all of Jungkook\u2019s assumptions to go to shit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>The First Meeting, where Jungkook doesn\u2019t \u201cmeet\u201d so much as he \u201ccreeps\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>He walks into Dream Bean one afternoon with his sketchbook to continue working on his plan for Professor Kim\u2019s course. One of Jimin\u2019s coworkers stands behind the counter. As soon as she sees Jungkook enter, she huffs and points at a little two-seater table tucked in corner of the shop.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s on break, flirt all you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook picks his way through a few tables of distressed students and their laptops before he realizes Jimin isn\u2019t alone. A ridiculously good-looking guy sits across from him, the kind of ridiculous that involves a chiseled jawline and defined biceps. He wears one of those tank tops with arm-openings all the way to the hem, showing off the cut of his ribs and the barest glimpse of his abs. Fluffy hair curves over his brow from beneath a purple snapback. He sits slouched back, legs spread, muscled forearms resting on the table. He laughs a lot, and he laughs loud.</p>\n<p>He looks like the boys who used to beat Jungkook up in high school.</p>\n<p>Jungkook ducks into the nearest empty booth and opens his sketchbook. Jimin hasn\u2019t noticed him. His attention is so fully focused on the other guy that Jungkook doesn\u2019t think ever will.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s flirting. It\u2019s obvious from just one glance, and Jungkook takes much more than one. Every move Jimin makes is carefully calculated. The way he runs his hand through his hair, eyes narrow; how he bites his lip, not at all like the unconscious way he does when he\u2019s thinking. He laughs with a hand covering his mouth and his head thrown back. It\u2019s not even directed at him yet Jungkook is enraptured. He can tell the other guy is, too, because his eyes don\u2019t stray from Jimin once. At one point he replaces the Dream Bean hat on Jimin\u2019s head with his own snapback, perched sideways. It makes Jimin giggle.</p>\n<p>From one sultry glance to the next, Jungkook is hit with a sudden realization.</p>\n<p>Jimin knows.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not oblivious. He hasn\u2019t mistaken Jungkook\u2019s advances for friendliness. Watching the way he flirts, so cognizant of the power he holds, Jungkook finally understands. It\u2019s impossible for Jimin not to have recognized his pathetic insinuations from the start. He thinks about his laughable coffee-pun pickup line and compares it to the meaning laced within Jimin\u2019s hooded gaze. All this time Jungkook thought he had something over Jimin, but maybe it\u2019s been the other way around. Taehyung and Hoseok were right after all. Jimin just isn\u2019t interested.</p>\n<p>Because right now, tongue sneaking out to wet his lower lip, gaze so intense Jungkook would shiver to have it fixed on him\u2014that\u2019s what an interested Jimin looks like. Jungkook stuffs his sketchbook back into his backpack and beelines for the swinging door. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He has never felt like such an idiot in his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Second Meeting, where Jungkook almost betrays Stark</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jungkook arrives at the daycare just in time to see a sleek, black motorcycle pull up ahead of him. He doesn\u2019t catch on right away. At first all he sees is the back of the boy sitting behind the driver, pressed close, arms wrapped around his waist. The boy has a nice ass, thick thighs that stand out when he swings a leg around to hop off the bike. As he reaches up to remove his helmet, Jungkook finally recognizes him.</p>\n<p>The driver is the same guy from Dream Bean, and he isn\u2019t wearing a helmet. He stays sitting, looking up at Jimin. Something he says sends Jimin into that signature full-body laugh, playfully hitting the guy\u2019s arm. Jungkook looks down at Stark the baby blue moped and feels woefully inadequate.</p>\n<p>Jimin notices him after a moment and waves him over. Somewhere between the guy pulling up and Jungkook tripping over the sidewalk on his way toward them, he decides that motorcycles are stupid and he can\u2019t imagine why he ever wanted one.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, meet Bobby,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHe\u2019s your hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man, nice to meet you.\u201d Bobby steps off his bike to greet Jungkook properly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jungkook tries not to sound too bitter, especially because Bobby seems unexpectedly genuine.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that your moped?\u201d Bobby peers over at Stark, parked a few feet away.</p>\n<p>For a wild three seconds, Jungkook considers lying. He almost opens his mouth to do it when he remembers that Jimin knows the truth. And he can\u2019t do that to Stark. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, yeah. Mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute.\u201d He grins.</p>\n<p>Jungkook tries but can\u2019t find even an ounce of mockery in Bobby\u2019s tone. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says, grudgingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get going. Call me when you want me to pick you up, yeah, Jiminie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s brief motorcycle hatred doesn\u2019t last long. He feels extra bitter watching Bobby ride away, because Stark can\u2019t fit two people. He\u2019ll never be able to drive Jimin anywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe goes here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Jimin says easily.</p>\n<p>Jungkook waits, but Jimin doesn\u2019t elaborate. He feels desperate for prying but asks anyway, \u201cSo how do you know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pauses at the daycare entrance thoughtfully, fingers resting on the door handle. He smiles like he knows something Jungkook doesn\u2019t. \u201cWe used to fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he opens the door and walks in without waiting to see if Jungkook follows.</p>\n<p>Jungkook freezes, brows furrowing, before it hits him and he jogs inside to catch up. He should have figured it out. Now it seems obvious. \u201cHey!\u201d he exclaims. Jimin stops by the front desk and asks Yongsun where they want him today, ignoring Jungkook entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, you\u2019re with the two-year-olds. Jungkook, they want you in fifth grade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin waves his thanks and heads down the hall. Jungkook hates fifth grade; they have the most attitude. He catches up with Jimin and leans close to say, \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d A group of younger girls runs by them. He lowers his voice. \u201c\u2014you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said \u2018not lately.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say \u2018not ever.\u2019\u201d Jimin looks far too amused for Jungkook\u2019s liking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it wasn\u2019t your thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot anymore, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pats his shoulder in false sympathy. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me, Jungkookie.\u201d Then he ducks into his classroom, leaving a stunned Jungkook behind him.</p>\n<p>He tries not to think too hard about Jimin and Bobby as he joins the fifth grade class. He fails, mostly, thinks about Jimin\u2019s secretive smile when he should be handing out snacks, thinks about what came before <em>lately</em>. Thinks too hard about the appreciative way Jimin looks at Bobby.</p>\n<p>Thinks too hard about how foolish he must have looked all along to Jimin, who suddenly seems much more like a hyung than before.</p>\n<p>Sometime before break, one of the boys approaches Jungkook with hesitant steps.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, hyung,\u201d he says, clutching a piece of paper close to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard Jimin hyung saying you like art. Do you think you could help me with something?\u201d He looks like his entire emotional wellbeing depends on Jungkook\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p>Jungkook ruffles his hair. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes Chan to a quieter table, squeezing himself into one of the tiny chairs. Chan very carefully slides the sheet of paper over. \u201cI\u2019m trying to draw a puppy but it doesn\u2019t really look like a puppy. I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The work is remarkably good for a fifth grader; Jungkook can see he has talent. For the next fifteen minutes he helps Chan with his sketch, explaining techniques in the simplest way he can. Chan grows visibly more confident as they talk. Seeing him draw with more assurance after so brief a conversation makes something in Jungkook spark with warmth. He feels accomplished. Like he did something worth doing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this what you\u2019re in college for?\u201d Chan asks after he grabs his water bottle for break and joins Jungkook at the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m studying art, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love it.\u201d The words spring to his lips so easily. He wonders why he couldn\u2019t say them to Professor Kim.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too. I want to be an artist like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t thought about it in a while, but now he remembers the wonder with which he used to attend elementary school art classes. He used to think art was the coolest thing in the world; he\u2019d wanted to paint since he was old enough to learn he could make a career out of it. His parents thought he would grow out of it, but he didn\u2019t. He drew anime characters across the margins of his notebooks in high school even though it only fueled the mockery, snuck out to spray paint graffiti in the city with Taehyung the night before graduating. He loved art. Loves it. It\u2019s easy to forget that in sight of grades and expectations.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think you could help me again next week?\u201d Chan asks before Jungkook\u2019s shift ends for the day.</p>\n<p>\u201cCourse I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waits for Jimin in the lobby after. When he comes down the hall, Jimin breaks into a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething the matter, Jungkookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, you can\u2019t just leave me with no explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already did.\u201d Jimin stifles a laugh behind his hand as he heads toward the door, Jungkook trailing behind him. \u201cSorry we can\u2019t study today. Next week, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook says hopelessly, and watches as Jimin runs to the sidewalk just in time for Bobby\u2019s revving motorcycle to pull up.</p>\n<p>Jungkook goes home that evening and catapults straight into Taehyung\u2019s bed when he gets there, which he seems to be doing a lot these days. He shoves Taehyung over to make room for himself, burying his face in his pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m sure your personal matters are highly important,\u201d Taehyung says, tongue sticking out of his mouth as he lies on his back with his phone held close to his face, \u201cI\u2019m very occupied with beating your high score in <em>Fun Run</em> right now\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to beat my high score.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014so please put your emotions on hold for the next ten minutes. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shimmies around until he can stick a hand between them and pinch Taehyung\u2019s side. Taehyung shrieks, fumbling his phone so it falls on his face with a smack.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so close!\u201d he wails, kicking Jungkook\u2019s leg. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to kick him again, but Jungkook maneuvers around to hold his legs down. Taehyung shoves his face away; Jungkook flips him onto his stomach. He pins his hands to the small of his back and holds them there until Taehyung gasps, \u201cOkay, okay, I give in.\u201d Taehyung might be a sneaky little shit, but Jungkook\u2019s always the stronger one. He rolls off and returns to cuddling Taehyung\u2019s pillow. \u201cSo what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know this dude named Bobby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno. Does he go here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen how the fuck am I supposed to know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sniffs and curls tighter around the pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s really hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s friends with Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey used to fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung whistles. \u201cHow hot is really hot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, really hot. He looks like those fuckboys in high school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fuckboy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he mumbles into his pillow. \u201cFuckboys don\u2019t care about anyone. I care about people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Sorry, Jungkookie.\u201d Taehyung\u2019s arm drapes across his back, tugging him close. \u201cI thought Jimin didn\u2019t fuck around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is this Bobby guy is vying for Jimin\u2019s attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung giggles near his ear. \u201cSo are you brushing up on your laundry skills yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d Jungkook snarls, and shoves his knee into Taehyung\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Third Meeting, where Jungkook learns something new</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jimin texts him a few days later, says he\u2019s on his way to the dining hall with Namjoon and Yoongi and wants to know if Jungkook can join. He almost refuses, spends ten minutes thinking of a reasonable excuse. Embarrassment still hovers over him like a cartoon raincloud. Jimin must think he\u2019s such a kid. But in the end he shuffles over to the dining hall anyway. After filling his plates with food, he finds them crowded at a round table by the window. Bobby reclines next to Jimin, the hood of his dark jacket pulled up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Jungkookie,\u201d Yoongi says. It\u2019s a nice change from the usual <em>hey,</em> <em>party boy</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook is more than a little peeved that Bobby is with them, and even more that Yoongi speaks to him so civilly. It\u2019s a stark difference from the mistrustful way he first met Jungkook. But he finds it hard to stay peeved when Bobby is awfully friendly and makes a visible effort to include him in every conversation, even when Jungkook gets a little quiet. He might moonlight as a party boy, he still finds it difficult to talk to people he doesn\u2019t really know. Parties are easier. Everyone\u2019s drunk and no one cares if he can\u2019t think of something clever to say.</p>\n<p>Eventually Jungkook slips in the question he really wants to ask. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t go here, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bobby shakes his head. \u201cNah, but I used to. Transferred to Dongguk after a year here. I\u2019m just visiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood riddance, too,\u201d Namjoon says, but it\u2019s clear from his smile that he doesn\u2019t mean it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were a menace,\u201d Yoongi adds, deadpan.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was not. I was a good kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember that time you moved all the furniture from the tenth floor physics classroom to the roof?\u201d Jimin interjects.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, I was really drunk. And you helped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it was your idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe good old days,\u201d Yoongi says sarcastically. \u201cBack when Jimin was an even bigger menace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung? A menace?\u201d Jungkook can\u2019t quite mask the disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t always like this.\u201d Bobby turns a grin on Jimin, who pouts. \u201cHe used to be kind of fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe used to be kind of like you.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s thoughtful gaze rests on Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>And suddenly everyone looks uncomfortable. Namjoon and Yoongi look to Jimin, and Bobby clears his throat. Jimin\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t look fazed. He just shrugs and winks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>But that only means Jungkook absolutely, definitely, positively <em>has</em> to worry about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Fourth Meeting, where Jungkook has regrets</em>\n</p>\n<p>He walks into Dream Bean to find Bobby sitting at the counter Jungkook usually inhabits, watching Jimin make coffee with a stupidly handsome grin on his face. At this point, coming to the coffee shop to work is habit; he hardly even thinks about whether or not Jimin will be there. And Jungkook likes sitting at the counter. That\u2019s his spot. He\u2019s not about to sit anywhere else, even if Kim Bobby\u2019s taken his spot. Granted, he sits on the tables just as frequently, but that\u2019s not the point.</p>\n<p>So he stubbornly marches over and sits down right next to Bobby. They greet him cheerfully. Jimin doesn\u2019t even bother asking for his order, just rings it up and starts making it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what are you working on?\u201d Bobby leans over to look at his sketchbook.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, a project. For my studio class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminie says you\u2019re really good at art.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at Jimin, who catches his glance and crosses his eyes in response. Jungkook smiles. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin hands him his drink within a few minutes and whisks away Bobby\u2019s mug for a refill. He takes care of a few customers before returning with the coffee. This time he hovers near them, resting his arms on his head and arching his back into a long stretch. Then he rubs at his neck, brushing aside his collar to reveal a stretch of smooth collarbone and a hint of his chest. His gaze alights on Bobby, the corner of his mouth curving in a slight smirk, before he returns to the register as a new customer enters.</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks down, flustered even though none of that was meant for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sucks to see him so swamped these days,\u201d Bobby says. \u201cTwo jobs, volunteering, dance. It\u2019s gotta be rough.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words slip from his mouth before he can stop them. He regrets them before he finishes. \u201cWhat do you care? You just wanna get in his pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bobby turns to him, brows raised. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d He shakes his head, holding up his hands. \u201cListen, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not that kind of guy. I like him. A lot.\u201d And the way he looks over at Jimin, eyes gentle, Jungkook knows he\u2019s telling the truth. \u201cI wanna say I\u2019m offended that you think I\u2019m like that. But I\u2019m glad Jimin has friends like you to look out for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wraps his hands around his mug of coffee, the heat searing through his skin. If Bobby isn\u2019t that kind of guy, then that means Jungkook is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Fifth Meeting, a coincidence</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jungkook spends so many hours working on Professor Kim\u2019s project that when he leaves the arts building, he\u2019s surprised to find night has already fallen. With the bundle of material he\u2019s been using to plan the project tucked under one arm and his backpack weighing down his shoulders, he begins the long trek back to his apartment. Weariness settles in his bones, but the draft is coming along so well he can\u2019t complain.</p>\n<p>Just past the library he sees Bobby walking in his direction, carrying Jimin on his back. Jimin\u2019s arms dangle loosely over Bobby\u2019s shoulders, and his face presses into his neck. His eyes are closed, lips brushing skin. Jungkook wonders what it would feel like to have Jimin\u2019s breath tickle him like that. He shivers just thinking about it.</p>\n<p>The last thing Jungkook wants to do is talk to Bobby after their recent conversation, but the latter stops right in front of him. He nods to him in lieu of waving, his hands busy holding Jimin\u2019s legs around his waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Jungkook asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just tired. You know how he is when it comes to dancing. He just won\u2019t give himself a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t know that. He wishes he did. But it turns out he doesn\u2019t know much about Jimin at all. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe probably would have kept going if I hadn\u2019t dragged his ass out of the practice room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be the best,\u201d Jimin mumbles, so quiet and sleepy Jungkook hardly catches it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo back to sleep, baby,\u201d Bobby says. The tenderness in his voice, the affectionate way he hoists Jimin more securely on his back, makes Jungkook\u2019s stomach churn. Suddenly he feels empty. \u201cHow\u2019re you gonna be the best if you don\u2019t rest, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin mumbles something else but it\u2019s incoherent to both of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take him home. I\u2019ll catch you around, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. See you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook walks the rest of the way home slowly. He\u2019d felt accomplished after spending so much time developing his project. Now he feels lost.</p>\n<p>When he gets back, Taehyung takes one look at his long face and says, \u201cWanna go to a party tonight? I can ask Hoseok hyung if anything\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, partying doesn\u2019t actually make me feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung looks appalled, eyes wide and confused. \u201cWhat do you mean it doesn\u2019t make you feel better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not like you and Hoseok hyung. I know it helps you guys destress, but not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why do you always go out when you\u2019re upset?\u201d Taehyung whines like Jungkook\u2019s just betrayed him in the worst way. It\u2019s a little funny but also not, because Jungkook feels like he\u2019s betrayed them both by admitting it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI just do.\u201d</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s a lie. He does know. It\u2019s because it seems like the right thing to do, even if it isn\u2019t. Because sitting at home and playing video games to cheer himself up is something high school Jungkook would have done, and he doesn\u2019t want to be anything like high school Jungkook. He\u2019s spent too long trying to erase him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the last time he sees Bobby.</p>\n<p>Stark\u2019s brakes begin acting up again, so he takes him to the auto shop with a cup of coffee just in case Jimin\u2019s working. One of the other mechanics stands behind the counter. Once he checks in, Jungkook asks, \u201cIs Jimin hyung around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe just stepped out back.\u201d He gestures to a side door.</p>\n<p>Jungkook moves toward it hesitantly, glancing back for approval. When the man nods, he slips out. Jimin\u2019s small figure crouches at the edge of the parking lot, orange hair bright against the dark cars on either side of him. He looks so vulnerable like that, shoulders hunched, tracing aimless shapes in the cement with a broken stick.</p>\n<p>Jungkook approaches carefully, caramel macchiato in hand. Jimin doesn\u2019t notice him, engrossed in his actions.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin glances up, startled, mouth open. \u201cJungkook? Where\u2019d you come from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy moped needed some work. Hyung, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on break,\u201d he says, as if that answers it.</p>\n<p>Jungkook lowers himself down next to Jimin, crossing his legs. \u201cHere.\u201d He holds out the coffee like an offering.</p>\n<p>Jimin takes it, peeking under the lid. \u201cMy favorite. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured it would be something disgustingly sweet with hardly any coffee in it at all.\u201d Jungkook doesn\u2019t have any room to talk. Bitter coffee makes him cringe; he\u2019s grown accustomed to Americanos out of forced habit.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to say I\u2019m a wimp?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA coffee wimp.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jimin exclaims, but he\u2019s smiling now, and that\u2019s an improvement. He smacks Jungkook\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>Jungkook flails dramatically, flopping back to the ground with his legs bent in an awkward position. \u201cFuck, you got me. You\u2019re, like, stronger than Iron Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook, shut up.\u201d But he\u2019s laughing, looking a little brighter than before, and Jungkook just grins from his vantage point on the ground.</p>\n<p>Jimin sobers.</p>\n<p>\u201cBobby asked me to be his boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sits up. His gut swoops, sinks all the way to his feet. He looks down at his hands, clenching tightly into fists. It\u2019s always going to be like this. Even if he thinks he\u2019s different now, he\u2019s not. Someone\u2019s always better.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances up. Jimin doesn\u2019t look at him. He remembers the first time he ever saw Jimin, turning down that girl\u2019s invitation and dropping his head onto his book like it was the end of the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe worst part is that I actually like him.\u201d Jimin\u2019s laugh is bitter.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you say no?\u201d He waits for Jimin to give him the usual excuse, that he has no time. But Jimin opens his mouth to answer, then closes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just can\u2019t,\u201d he finally says. He stands up. \u201cCome on. They\u2019re probably looking for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook can\u2019t do anything but follow.</p>\n<p>Jeon Jungkook never gives up, but lately he\u2019s been thinking about it a lot.</p>\n<p>The first time he considered giving up was that long ago day in the coffee shop, when Namjoon asked if he was bothering Jimin, and Jimin said <em>no, he was trying to make me laugh</em>. The second time he considered giving up came with Jimin\u2019s honest flood of words that evening outside his apartment. <em>It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s this fucking challenge for people</em>. The third time, when he sat in Dream Bean and watched Jimin flirt and realized that obliviousness and lack of interest were two very different things. The fourth, when Bobby said, <em>I\u2019m not that kind of guy</em>.</p>\n<p>Since then he has considered giving up on the bet every moment of every day. When he walks past Dream Bean and thinks of Jimin inside, flitting back and forth between making drinks and ringing up customers, pausing for a desperate breath to pull off his hat and run his hands tiredly through his hair. When he paints and remembers the awed way Jimin looked at his work, like he could do anything. When he passes the gym and thinks of Jimin dancing himself dizzy in one of the practice rooms, only now Bobby\u2019s gone back home and there\u2019s no one to stop him when he overdoes it.</p>\n<p>In a fit of honesty one night, he tells Taehyung everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably been fucking laughing behind my back this whole time,\u201d he murmurs, curled up small on the couch, Taehyung\u2019s hand rubbing circles on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin\u2019s too nice for that. You know him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does. He knows the Jimin who grows so upset each time he rejects someone, who hates the label of heartbreaker, could never willfully lead him on like that. But all he can think about is high school, and the boy he loved for four years, and the way his laughter sounded in Jungkook\u2019s ears when he confessed. And the way it echoed in his head throughout the ceremony the next day, so that he couldn\u2019t even smile when he graduated.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie.\u201d Taehyung turns him around and pulls him into his chest, fingers threading through his hair. \u201cThis was just supposed to be a stupid game. It wasn\u2019t ever supposed to get this far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were just going to hit on him a bit and let it go. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d put in so much effort. Volunteering, studying with him\u2014you went too far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it, huh? Why\u2019d you try so hard?\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks about the amalgamation of thoughts and events and insecurities that led him to this point, and finds it too difficult to explain how the ghost of kicks to his side landed by laughing high school boys + amusement in the eyes of someone he thought he loved + months of trying very hard to be someone very different = this, pursuing Park Jimin and blundering like an idiot. A, B, and C don\u2019t logically equal D. He\u2019s never been good at math.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you wanna stop, I won\u2019t make you do my laundry anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so sweetly innocent a gesture that Jungkook smiles. As if doing Taehyung\u2019s laundry was ever the problem to begin with.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should just stop. You\u2019re making yourself sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the first warning.</p>\n<p>The second comes from Professor Kim Seokjin, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Jimin.</p>\n<p>Jungkook goes to his office willingly this time around, his project draft in hand. He knocks on the door with a hint of excitement, and when Professor Kim calls him in, he nearly bounces to sit in the seat across his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI finished my plan,\u201d he says immediately, handing over the folder of material.</p>\n<p>Kim looks through it carefully, examining each piece of paper with intense detail. The only reactions he shows are the movement of his eyebrows and the occasional, \u201cHm.\u201d He takes so long that Jungkook fidgets. But then, finally, he looks up and smiles. \u201cThis is fantastic. Exactly what I expected from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d He can\u2019t help the answering grin that splits his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work, you know that, right? All the small details.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I wanted to make it worthwhile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy to hear that, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I also\u2014I volunteer at this daycare. And one of the kids, he likes art, so I\u2019ve been helping him out for a few weeks.\u201d He almost hadn\u2019t gone again, too embarrassed to see Jimin, but then he had remembered his promise to Chan.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Kim leans forward in interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd his mom came to me last time, said his school doesn\u2019t offer any art classes. So she was wondering if I could teach him, kind of like a tutoring thing, but for art. She even said she\u2019d pay me. But, um, I would have done it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Professor Kim Seokjin looks so ridiculously happy that suddenly Jungkook feels like it hasn\u2019t been such a bad two weeks after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel about it? Helping someone else with art?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d He rubs the back of his head awkwardly. \u201cReally good. It kind of reminds me how much I loved art growing up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do, I just\u2014\u201d He hesitates, trying to formulate his thoughts properly. \u201cI get lost. In all the other stuff that comes with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat happens to me, too. Sometimes you just need something to remind you why you\u2019re here in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to give you an extra assignment, if you\u2019re interested. I know it\u2019s just more work, but I think it\u2019ll be good for you. And you can use it to replace the grade for the project you failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWrite me an essay. About why you chose to study art.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a visual arts major for a reason,\u201d Jungkook says wryly. \u201cI hate writing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to write a lot as an artist, too. You know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do really well. You\u2019re very talented when you try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you keep telling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to believe it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with partying, having fun, sleeping around.\u201d He gives Jungkook a pointed glance; on more than one occasion he\u2019s stumbled into class in someone else\u2019s clothes. \u201cYou might as well have fun while you can. Life can get pretty dull.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a problem when you let it get in the way of what you really want out of life. Or,\u201d he adds as an afterthought, \u201cwhen you hurt someone. Even if that someone is yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wants to be irritated that he\u2019s getting an unsolicited life lesson from someone not all that much older than him, but his words resonate so deeply Jungkook feels a sudden weight in his chest. He finds himself unable to answer, staring at his hands resting on his knees instead. Professor Kim doesn\u2019t push it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was about to get lunch, if you\u2019d like to join me. I can give you some tips for your new tutoring gig.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounds awkward, lunch with a professor, but Jungkook\u2019s nodding before he can change his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd since we\u2019re technically about to leave campus, you can call me hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook follows him to the door, hands wrapped tightly around his backpack straps. \u201cThanks,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cHyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sees Jimin on the walk home, leaving Dream Bean with his bag slung over one shoulder. It looks relatively empty but Jimin\u2019s shoulders sag, head bowed, as if it weighs a ton. His feet shuffle in slow, tired movements. Ever since Bobby\u2019s short visit came to an end, Jimin has been off.</p>\n<p>Jungkook ducks into the nearest classroom building before Jimin sees him, walking in his direction. He sits on a bench in the lobby and waits until he\u2019s sure Jimin is long gone. Jungkook has avoided him for two weeks now. It\u2019s easy to act busy with the stress of midterms, easy to make excuses. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t bear to face him, not after hearing from his own mouth how much he liked Bobby, not after truly understanding how na\u00efve he had been. Taehyung says avoiding him will only make things worse, make Jungkook\u2019s embarrassment loom until it\u2019s bigger than it ever needed to be. No matter his original intentions, they\u2019re friends now. But Jungkook\u2019s stomach churns whenever he sees him, so he restricts their interactions to the daycare.</p>\n<p>But even in those small moments, Jungkook can tell Jimin\u2019s mask of positivity is thinning. He looks tired, smiles coming to his face a little slower than normal. The first time Jungkook rejects his offer to study, claiming he has a meeting, it\u2019s at the daycare. Jimin\u2019s smile drops with Jungkook\u2019s refusal. He only asks once more after that, and when Jungkook feigns another excuse, Jimin doesn\u2019t ask again.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s gotten used to studying in Dream Bean and Jimin\u2019s apartment, listening to Jimin\u2019s frustrated sighs and high-pitched laughs. He misses him. One day he stops by the practice rooms to say hi to Hoseok just as Jimin\u2019s walking off down the hall. Hoseok catches the wistful way Jungkook stares after him and asks, \u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook answers, and he means it. Jimin is beautiful and his ass makes Jungkook want to die and he\u2019s sweet and funny and lively, but Jungkook hasn\u2019t liked anyone since high school. It might be a long time before he can bring himself to like anyone like that again. But he cares about Jimin, a lot. He\u2019s realized that much.</p>\n<p>So it hurts to see Jimin so down, and it\u2019s lonely being away from him. He hadn\u2019t realized how much time they were spending together until he pulled away. He wants to know why Jimin would turn Bobby down if it clearly hurt him this much, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s his place to ask. He wants to comfort Jimin, find out what\u2019s wrong, bring him a cup of coffee when he\u2019s studying too hard. But that\u2019s not his place, either.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what to do other than run away, so he runs away.</p>\n<p>But watching Jimin walk away that afternoon, he realizes the first warning didn\u2019t come from Taehyung after all; it came from Hoseok, murmured half-conscious on a couch soiled in alcohol. <em>You don\u2019t have to prove yourself to anyone. </em></p>\n<p>Jeon Jungkook never gives up. When he was in high school, Taehyung dared him to scale the fence around the field behind their school. Much taller than him and made of noisy mesh metal, it seemed like an impossible feat. He tried and failed for three days straight, so he practiced jumping in the school gym until he could leap high enough to grab onto the top of the fence and propel himself over with his feet braced against the mesh. In his first month of college, he went to a party where the girl hosting refused to let him at any of the good alcohol because he was \u201cjust a kid.\u201d He went to every party she threw and hounded her until she finally gave in.</p>\n<p>And when he was twelve his parents told him he couldn\u2019t be an artist because it wasn\u2019t practical, that art had to remain a hobby and nothing more. It took him five years to convince them otherwise, but he did. Because Jeon Jungkook never gives up.</p>\n<p>But lately he has learned that there are times when giving up is the honorable thing to do, not the cowardly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s long overdue. Hoseok\u2019s words should have made him realize it. Taehyung\u2019s doubt should have done it, his own doubt should have done it. Instead, it\u2019s Kim Seokjin\u2019s words that make him pause and take a good, hard look at himself. Maybe partying isn\u2019t the best way to push away the doubtful, anxious high schooler he used to be, but that\u2019s something he can explore later. Because right now, partying isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is that he\u2019s doing something that could hurt Jimin\u2014something that\u2019s already hurting himself.</p>\n<p>Maybe if he had learned soon enough, he wouldn\u2019t be here, ducking out of sight every time he sees Jimin across campus, fighting a mix of crippling guilt and utter embarrassment. He wouldn\u2019t have done something so foolishly disrespectful as make a bet toying with the emotions of a boy who has good reasons for keeping to himself.</p>\n<p>He reroutes to Taehyung\u2019s afternoon classroom in the education building. Sinking to the cold linoleum floor by the door, he waits until class lets up and students flood out. Taehyung doesn\u2019t notice him, turning in the other direction, but Jungkook chases him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s off,\u201d he says, a little breathlessly. \u201cThe bet\u2019s off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the alleviation of his guilt comes a new understanding: he has to make it up to Jimin. Even though Jimin has no idea about the bet, Jungkook owes that to him. At first he doesn\u2019t know how to do it, just that he has to do something. The answer arrives, unexpectedly, from Jung Hoseok. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Hoseok\u2019s phone call comes when Jungkook leaves his last exam Thursday evening, asking him if he\u2019s going to Minji\u2019s celebratory end-of-midterms party. He remembers the longing way Jimin had asked if his parties were fun, and how Yoongi said he used to party as much as Jungkook did. Maybe he missed it.</p>\n<p>He stops by Dream Bean on the way home. Luckily, Jimin\u2019s on shift; he switches with his coworker to stand at the register when Jungkook enters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Jungkook,\u201d he says hesitantly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been here in a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I was, uh, busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe usual?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not staying. I just came to ask you something.\u201d He tries to keep his voice steady, shielding his nervousness.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk me what?\u201d The dark circles under Jimin\u2019s eyes look awfully prominent. His face is thinner, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you working tomorrow night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to go to a party with me? And Hoseok hyung, too. And Taehyungie hyung, probably, he can\u2019t stay away from parties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin bites his lip and glances away, brow furrowing slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should bring Namjoon hyung and Yoongi hyung, too,\u201d he says, in the hopes that it will deter Jimin from thinking Jungkook\u2019s still trying to hit on him. \u201cIt\u2019s just one night. You don\u2019t have to stay for long if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d Jimin finally says, dragging his eyes up to meet Jungkook\u2019s. \u201cAll of a sudden.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just\u2014\u201d he falters. \u201cYou seemed really stressed lately. I thought maybe you could use a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few customers line up behind him. Jimin peers over at them, then back at Jungkook. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo pressure. You don\u2019t have to. I just, um, thought you might want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you later, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>He paces the nineteen steps from one side of the living room to the next about thirty times (he counts). His phone rests on the coffee table on full volume, and he glances it at after every turn. Taehyung munches on tteokbokki crackers, watching him stroll back and forth from the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if you, like, walk so much you wear the floor down,\u201d Taehyung says with a full mouth. \u201cAnd then you fall into our downstairs neighbors\u2019 apartment. That would be funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding him for weeks and now you\u2019re desperately inviting him to a party? That\u2019s kind of out of the blue, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook pauses by the TV. \u201cI miss him,\u201d he mumbles, looking anywhere but at Taehyung when he admits it. \u201cHe\u2019s been down and I want to cheer him up. I owe him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie,\u201d Taehyung coos. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook lunges toward him. He dives out of the way, shrieking with laughter and dropping his bag of crackers in the process. Jungkook has him in a headlock when a blip of the <em>Shingeki no Kyojin</em> theme song startles them. He freezes, then pushes Taehyung away and snatches up his phone.</p>\n<p>He stares at the text message notification for so long Taehyung kicks him. When he finally swipes to check, it\u2019s Hoseok. He\u2019s sent two pictures of skinny jeans and asked which one he should wear.</p>\n<p>Jungkook groans and throws his phone on the couch.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s text comes after midnight, when Jungkook has almost forgotten he was waiting at all. <em>So where\u2019s this party? ^o^</em> it reads. Jungkook scrambles to answer, stops himself, and wonders exactly how many minutes he should wait to not seem desperate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready yet?\u201d Taehyung yells from the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Jungkook skids out of his room, runs back in to grab his phone, then vaults back to Taehyung. \u201cDo I look okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look fine. Come on, they\u2019re probably already waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, you don\u2019t understand, <em>do I look okay</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung grabs him by the collar and yanks him out the door. Jungkook frets all the way down, running a hand through his hair at each floor the elevator dings past, fixing the hem of his shirt and securing his pants and checking his laces.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re only this worried about your outfit because Jimin\u2019s coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung giggles. \u201cCute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook makes as if to punch him. Taehyung leaps to the other side of the elevator just as the doors slide open to the first floor. \u201cCoward,\u201d Jungkook says triumphantly, marching off through the lobby.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink too much!\u201d Hyejin calls from where she sits with her legs kicked up onto the front desk, a bowl of instant ramen in hand. When they turn to her in surprise, she says, \u201cI mean, like, don\u2019t throw up in the lobby or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you look at that? She actually cares about us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not care about you dumb fucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>But her expression looks suitably guilty, and they leave the building laughing. They reach the halfway point between campus and Minji\u2019s apartment to find the others already there. Hoseok stands with his arm slung around Jimin\u2019s shoulders, saying something that has Jimin in a fit of laughter. Namjoon\u2019s dressed to the nines, Yoongi looks effortlessly good, and Hoseok is as flawless as ever. And Jimin\u2014<em>Jimin</em>.</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s stopped until Taehyung looks back at him, two steps ahead. It\u2019s deceptively simple, Jimin\u2019s outfit, but Jungkook feels his heart flutter and stumble in his chest and suddenly he\u2019s not quite sure this is a good idea after all. He\u2019s dressed head-to-toe in black, a loose shirt with a wide neck that displays his sharp collarbones and broadens his shoulders, tucked into these jeans that hug him so well. His black boots make him the slightest bit taller. A long silver chain hangs to just above his stomach. The monotone outfit only makes his orange hair stand out more, parted in swoops on either side of his forehead. He\u2019s wearing eyeliner. The intensity it grants his gaze is almost painful.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jungkook says, a little breathlessly. He wants to tell him how good he looks but all that comes out is, \u201cUh, nice shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi intones, and Jungkook tears his eyes away from Jimin to look at him. He bears an amused smirk. \u201cGood to see you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, no <em>hey</em> for us?\u201d Namjoon says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I was\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d he splutters, a flush creeping up his neck.</p>\n<p>Hoseok snorts and suddenly they\u2019re all laughing, clapping him on the back and pulling him along. It\u2019s fifteen minutes to Minji\u2019s place, and Jungkook spends all of them with a minimum of three people between him and Jimin because he\u2019s not sure if he can talk to him without stammering.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you managed to convince these old men to come party,\u201d Hoseok says to Jimin. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who could, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I like parties,\u201d Namjoon objects.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong. You like getting drunk.\u201d Hoseok jabs a finger at Yoongi, then turns to Namjoon. \u201cAnd you like girls. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else are parties good for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe atmosphere! It\u2019s the feel of it, you know?\u201d Hoseok swings his arms out wide, as if the air around him can testify. \u201cTaehyung\u2019s the only one out of you idiots who really gets it.\u201d He says it like appreciating parties is some kind of secret held close by the universe.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Jungkook says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou.\u201d Hoseok swings the bottle of whiskey he\u2019s bringing Minji in Jungkook\u2019s direction. \u201cYou, Jungkookie, are a different story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s not sure what that means but he doesn\u2019t ask.</p>\n<p>Like Hoseok, Minji has gained notoriety for throwing the best parties. She always provides good alcohol and good music, and her apartment has a balcony and enough room for a fair amount of guests. Her neighbors are usually in attendance, so she rarely gets noise complaints.</p>\n<p>The balcony doors are propped open when they get there, a few people lounging by the rails. Leftover lights from streetlamps and passing cars add to the black lights hung in corners of the living room. Drake blasts from large speakers hooked up to a flatscreen TV. They head to the kitchen, where bottles of various alcohol line the counters and the fridge\u2019s shelves. Hoseok adds his whiskey to the collection and pours them all drinks per preference.</p>\n<p>Jimin takes three shots of tequila in quick succession.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Hoseok says, watching Jimin. \u201cSomebody\u2019s gotta not get piss drunk and make sure all of us make it home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just drink a little,\u201d Jungkook says. He doesn\u2019t really want to get trashed. He kind of just wants to talk to Jimin. Granted, a party isn\u2019t exactly the best place for that, but at least he won\u2019t feel as nervous.</p>\n<p>\"Then I'm getting fucking wasted,\" Taehyung says cheerfully, and proceeds to pour himself another shot.</p>\n<p>\"I'm gonna dance.\" Jimin grabs Hoseok's wrists and pulls him off into the crowd. Jungkook watches them go, shuffling his feet awkwardly. Now that he's here he doesn't know what to do.</p>\n<p>\"Here, kid.\" Yoongi shoves a can of shitty beer at him. He takes it reluctantly.</p>\n<p>They disperse after that. Yoongi and Namjoon disappear onto the balcony, and Taehyung joins a game of beer pong. Jungkook stops to chat with Yugyeom from art history for a little while, grabs a second beer when he finishes his first.</p>\n<p>At some point he catches sight of Jimin dancing with Hoseok, his back pressed to the latter's chest with hardly space for air between them. He drags his hips in tantalizing movements. Hoseok's hands rest on his waist, holding him close, a grin on his face as he whispers something that makes Jimin throw his head back onto Hoseok's shoulder and laugh.</p>\n<p>Jungkook knows there's nothing between them, but he feels a burning pit of jealousy anyway. He bumps into Jisoo from his Study of Contemporary Artists class, and after some mindless conversation they start to dance. Any other day and it would have been great, but today\u2019s not any other day. He tries not to look at Jimin, until he finally does and realizes he's gone. Hoseok has made it to the couch instead. Jungkook pulls away from Jisoo and goes to him.</p>\n<p>\"Where's Jimin?\"</p>\n<p>\"Getting another drink.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook finds Jimin in the kitchen taking shots. He waves him over.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkookie, wanna take a shot with me?\" His voice is slurred. He's already drunk.</p>\n<p>\"Are you a lightweight?\"</p>\n<p>\"I dunno what you're talking about, Jeon Jungkookie.\" Jimin pats his arm, then squeezes. \"How come your arms are so big?\"</p>\n<p>\"Um.\"</p>\n<p>\"Take a shot.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nah, I'm good.\" He waves his can of beer for proof.</p>\n<p>\"Okay. Then you gotta dance with me. There's this really hot guy eyeing me up, over there by the TV, you see him? Gotta make him jealous.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hyung,\" Jungkook says, and doesn't manage to keep the hint of upset from his voice.</p>\n<p>\"Never mind,\" Jimin says. \"That's stupid. I'll just go talk to him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hyung, wait-\"</p>\n<p>But Jimin's already halfway into the living room, heading straight for the guy standing by the TV's speakers. Jungkook doesn't like his hooded gaze, the way he looks at Jimin when he nears him and puts a hand on his chest. With a groan of despair, Jungkook collapses into the fridge and bangs his head against the cool metal.</p>\n<p>He finds an empty space of wall in the living room and slides to the ground, leaning against it with his third can of beer dangling from his hand. The stereo\u2019s playing some atrocious pop song and it\u2019s giving him a headache. Dancing bodies fill the space in front of him, the game of beer pong over to the side getting awfully loud. He probably can\u2019t walk two steps without his shoulders brushing someone else\u2019s but he feels lonely.</p>\n<p>When he was younger all he needed to cheer him up was his sketchbook and a good graphite pencil. Sometimes he\u2019d call Taehyung and they would play video games and watch anime all night, piles of junk food scattered around them. Or he would walk to the park and climb trees; he liked that, the physical activity, the quiet. Taehyung needs to be around people to feel better, but Jungkook has never been like that. He wonders why he ever thought parties would make him happy. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He sits there for so long he loses track of time. Eventually he pushes himself up and heads to the balcony to check on the others.</p>\n<p>Namjoon reclines on the ground in the corner, a bottle of soju and a shot glass in hand. Yoongi stands next to him, leaning over the rail.</p>\n<p>\"I just don't get it, you know? Like why are there people in this world who have to be alone? I mean, there's, like, seven billion people in this goddamn world and there's still people who are all alone-\"</p>\n<p>\"Joonie,\" Yoongi says. \"Shut the fuck up.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hyung, are you drunk?\" Jungkook notes Yoongi's flushed face with amusement. He must have been sitting there for longer than he thought if they\u2019re both drunk already.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not drunk, you brat,\" Yoongi growls.</p>\n<p>The sudden sound of cheers from inside has them all turning their heads.</p>\n<p>Yoongi narrows his eyes. \"Where's Jimin?\"</p>\n<p>\"I dunno, dancing with some guy.\"</p>\n<p>\"You have to take care of him,\" Namjoon says from the ground. \"Don't let him do anything he\u2019ll regret.\"</p>\n<p>They're both looking at him like he should have known that. He spins on his heel and runs inside, dread stirring in his stomach. But it\u2019s not Jimin who lies on the table with a lime in his mouth\u2014it\u2019s someone else. Jungkook cranes his neck to peer over the crowd gathering to watch and sees Jimin by the wall, suddenly looking rather lost. He breathes a sigh of relief and ducks through to reach him.</p>\n<p>\"Hyung, are you okay?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Jimin looks at him, eyes glazed, as if he hadn\u2019t notice him walk up. His smile is dim. \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m fine. Where's everybody else?\"</p>\n<p>\"Around.\" From where he stands he can see Taehyung and Hoseok on the couch, the former nearly asleep.</p>\n<p>\"I gotta pee.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay, come on.\" He leads him down the hallway, past a couple making out against the wall. The room at the end of the hall has its light on, so he assumes it's the bathroom. When he opens the door all the way he finds a dude pissing in the toilet. \"Sorry,\" he mutters, turning away until he leaves. Then he pushes Jimin inside and closes the door after him.</p>\n<p>He waits there, hands shoved in his pockets. It's probably been a few hours and everyone's already drunk, and he's not, so maybe that's why he isn't having fun. He just wanted to cheer Jimin up, but now Jimin doesn\u2019t look very happy, either.</p>\n<p>He hears the toilet flush. The door opens a moment later. Jimin has straightened his shirt and fixed his hair. \"I'm hungry,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs helplessly.</p>\n<p>\"Can we go somewhere and eat?\"</p>\n<p>\"I dunno if we should leave everyone-\"</p>\n<p>\"Hoseokie hyung isn't that drunk. He can take care of them.\"</p>\n<p>\"I dunno, I-\"</p>\n<p>\"Come on.\" Jimin takes his hand decisively and pulls him back toward the couch where Taehyung\u2019s head rests in Hoseok\u2019s lap. \"We're gonna leave to eat.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Hoseok says easily.</p>\n<p>Then Jimin pulls him out toward the balcony, where Namjoon has started another rant and Yoongi is rolling his eyes. \u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna leave to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s eyes narrow, dropping to their joined hands. \u201cIs that all you\u2019re gonna do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m gonna eat so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi ignores Jimin, staring at Jungkook instead. \u201cI swear,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna go eat. Then I\u2019ll take him home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen up,\u201d Yoongi pushes off the railing, stumbling a little. He\u2019s half a head shorter than Jungkook but still rather intimidating as he jabs a finger into Jungkook\u2019s chest. \u201cHe better get home safely or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon yanks on the end of Yoongi\u2019s jacket. \u201cRelax, hyung.\u201d But then he looks at Jungkook, too. \u201cYou take care of him or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jimin tugs on Jungkook\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on.\u201d He turns his attention to Yoongi and rather gleefully says, \u201cHyung, you\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking <em>drunk</em> you little shit\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls a laughing Jungkook back into the apartment before anything else can be said. They take the elevator down to the lobby. As soon as they\u2019re outside, Jimin stops walking.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. Piggyback.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to piggyback you all the way to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie,\u201d he whines.</p>\n<p>Jungkook sighs and bends so Jimin can hop onto his back, securing his arms around his neck. He curves his arms under Jimin\u2019s knees to hoist him up securely. Jimin doesn\u2019t weigh much; carrying him like this hardly feels like anything. \u201cThere\u2019s a pojangmacha not far from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He\u2019s taken no more than five steps when Jimin\u2019s voice sounds by his ear, breath tickling skin. \u201cFaster!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook makes a noise of complaint but then he speeds up so fast Jimin shrieks and tightens his hold around his neck. His shout turns into laughter as Jungkook bends low and runs through the streets, zooming left and right just for fun. After a little while, Jungkook\u2019s laughing, too. When the pojangmacha\u2019s plastic tent comes into view, Jimin jumps off and walks beside him instead. Jungkook holds open the flaps of the tent for Jimin to duck inside first. They squeeze into the tiny plastic chairs of a table in the back.</p>\n<p>\u201cSoju, please,\u201d Jimin calls to the woman serving.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo soju,\u201d Jungkook quickly says. She shrugs. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t drink more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re boring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we get dakkochi, mandu\u2014hyung, what else do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTteokbokki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd tteokbokki.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s energy seems to go down a little while they wait for their food. He rests his chin his hand, shoulders sagging. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to a party in such a long time,\u201d he finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shrugs. \u201cJust reminds me of how things used to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you\u2014\u201d he hesitates. Jimin stares at him expectantly. \u201cHow come you stopped? Partying and stuff. Yoongi hyung said you used to be like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin swirls his finger on the table, eyes downcast. \u201cMy dad got sick. So I grew up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He remembers Jimin fumbling the keys outside his apartment, that evening after the daycare. <em>My dad gets sick sometimes and has to take off days. </em>\u201cIs he okay now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s better. But sometimes he gets bad again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi hyung likes me better now, anyway. Since I\u2019m not a menace.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook snorts. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you as a menace. Yoongi hyung said you used to be like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really that wild, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, this one time I got a straight guy to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But just then their food arrives, and he snaps his mouth shut. The woman places the steaming plates in front of them and Jimin\u2019s eyes widen comically. He digs in as soon as she moves away. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Jimin says after a little while of eating. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin leans across the table and stage whispers, \u201cI have a tattoo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs. \u201cOh, so wild.\u201d They may be illegal, but everyone has tattoos these days.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn my ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shuts up quick.</p>\n<p>Jimin giggles and returns to eating like nothing happened at all. \u201cActually, that\u2019s not really that wild, either. I just thought your reaction would be funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hardly ever eat this much. When I was a freshman Bobby and I used to go to a pojangmacha after every party and we\u2019d eat so much.\u201d Jimin sighs into his food. \u201cBobby and I had all sorts of fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook squirms from the reminder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought if I got really drunk I wouldn\u2019t miss him as much but now I miss him more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you\u2014you said you liked him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why\u2019d you turn him down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause the last time I liked someone it was so bad, Jungkookie, so bad sometimes I still cry about it. It was the worst decision of my life and I don\u2019t ever wanna like anyone again.\u201d The words come out in a flood, like Jimin hasn\u2019t said them in a long time and now that he\u2019s started he can\u2019t stop. \u201cIt was so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung.\u201d The knowledge burdens him even more than before. People out there, himself included, have turned Jimin into this willful heartbreaker when really he\u2019s been the one with a broken heart all along.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re asking me so many questions? Now you have to tell me a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe last time I liked someone it was really bad, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jimin takes a bite out of his dakkochi and waits with wide eyes for Jungkook to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was, um, high school. But when I confessed he laughed at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI liked him for four years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you like such an asshole, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was an asshole,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, fiddling with the bowl of tteokbokki. \u201cI thought he was everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s always the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo then I got to college and I was like, well, I gotta prove I\u2019m not someone to be laughed at. I don\u2019t ever want to be laughed at again. That\u2019s why I started sleeping around and stuff, I think. To prove I could.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says heavily. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that. He was an asshole. Don\u2019t make yourself sad because of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I get to ask a question now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you asked, like, ten. It\u2019s still my turn. So what\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRed. Black. White.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have three favorite colors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m done eating, we can go now,\u201d Jimin announces, standing up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on, lemme pay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying.\u201d He runs up to the woman and tugs his wallet out before Jungkook can even move. Jungkook\u2019s not sure how he managed to fit a wallet into pants that tight, but he doesn\u2019t question it.</p>\n<p>Jimin demands a piggyback ride again when they leave the tent, and Jungkook calls him annoying but picks him up anyway. Halfway to his apartment, Jimin serenely says from where his head rests on Jungkook\u2019s shoulder that he doesn\u2019t have his keys.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your keys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJoonie hyung has them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what the hell are we supposed to do without your keys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just sleepover at your place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have room, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>So he carries Jimin home, and even when they reach the building, Jimin doesn\u2019t get down. It takes Jungkook a minute to realize Jimin has fallen asleep, soft breaths warm against his shoulder. He thinks with a twinge of amusement of the last time he saw Bobby, carrying Jimin just like this. How he had wished to be him. Now he realizes it\u2019s not so simple. It doesn\u2019t mean anything after all.</p>\n<p>Hyejin is half asleep at the front desk when he enters. She peers at him and Jimin curiously. \u201cWhere\u2019s Taehyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill at the party.\u201d</p>\n<p>She narrows her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t leave him alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNight, Jeon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNight, noona.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hides her face behind her comic book but he can tell she\u2019s smiling, thrown off by his words.</p>\n<p>His apartment is dark. He stumbles around a bit before making it to his room and lowering Jimin gently into bed. With careful fingers he undoes the laces on Jimin\u2019s boots and removes them, tucking the blanket over his sleeping figure. He strips to his boxers and an undershirt and shifts Jimin closer to the wall so there\u2019s room for him to lie down next to him. Taehyung\u2019s bed is empty and he could sleep there if he wanted to, but he doesn\u2019t. Jimin\u2019s warm and sleepy and he\u2019d rather stay.</p>\n<p>Jimin stirs and mumbles, \u201cJungkookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, go back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNight.\u201d He curls closer to Jungkook, their knees knocking together. Jungkook slides his arm around Jimin\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook plops down in front of Taehyung on the living room floor three days later with a notebook, his sketchbook, and three colored pens he stole from Hyejin at the front desk. Taehyung stretches out on the rug in a ridiculously large pair of pajamas, fake glasses perched on his nose as he copies over notes from class.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cHere\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat plan?\u201d Taehyung mumbles distractedly, chewing on the end of his pencil.</p>\n<p>Jungkook points at his notebook, covered in a messy scrawl from writing too fast, and then at his sketchbook, where he\u2019s drawn a particularly elaborate diagram utilizing all three colors (baby blue, dark green, and this ridiculously bright hot pink). \u201cThe plan. How to make it up to Jiminie hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shoots him a look. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know you did anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but <em>I</em> know.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a second Jungkook thinks Taehyung will tell him to fuck off but then he nods and sits up, crossing his legs underneath him and resting his chin in his hands. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung might come up with occasionally life-endangering plans, but at least he always humors Jungkook\u2019s. \u201cOkay, so there\u2019s three goals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait. Does this plan have a name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlan Cheer Up Jiminie Hyung, I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s boring. How about, \u2018Operation Put the Spark Back in Park\u2019s Life\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fucking stupidest name I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it perfect? Okay, go on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not naming it that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo late. Please continue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook groans. \u201cFine. Goal number one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Goal #1: Make Jiminie hyung laugh.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t find Jungkook particularly funny, but whenever Jungkook goofs off Jimin laughs like it\u2019s the funniest thing in the world. So Jungkook thinks making Jimin laugh whenever they\u2019re together will be an easy way to cheer him up, at least a little bit. From then on every time he\u2019s with Jimin he goes the extra mile to make a fool out of himself so Jimin will laugh that full-body laugh of his, falling every which way.</p>\n<p>It gets to the point where others start to notice. He runs into Jimin and Namjoon in the dining hall and makes a stupid joke about the food that has Jimin hitting the table and snorting, and Namjoon looks at him and says rather wryly, \u201cYou could start reading from a bad jokes book and Jiminie would still laugh, just because it\u2019s you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flushes with pride at that.</p>\n<p>He borrows Taehyung\u2019s bicycle to ride to the arts building one day because he\u2019s too lazy to walk, but it\u2019s not far enough to justify taking Stark. On the junction between the library and Dream Bean, he stops to adjust his large portfolio bag, strapped across his chest and hanging off his back. Coincidentally (or perhaps it\u2019s fate again) Jimin walks out of the coffee shop just then, removing his uniform hat to fluff out his hair. Jungkook rides up, stopping right in front of him. Jimin looks up like he\u2019s going to yell at him for blocking his way before he registers who he is and relaxes.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, you surprised me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook tightens his jaw and jerks his head back, the universal \u201cget on, baby.\u201d Jimin blinks. Jungkook jerks his head again. Then Jimin dissolves into a fit of giggles and hits his shoulder. Somewhere between the first squeak that sneaks into his laugh and the moment Jungkook cracks, laughing along with him, he feels a strange sort of flutter in his stomach. He thinks maybe he could listen to Jimin laugh forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to pick me up on a fucking bicycle?\u201d Jimin says. \u201cWith a basket?\u201d He reaches out and flicks the straw basket filled with fake pink and white flowers hanging from the handlebars.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, this is hyung\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does Taehyung have a flower basket?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis little girl he tutors gave it to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin visibly melts. Jungkook\u2019s stomach flutters again, aftershocks from before. \u201cThat\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess it kind of ruins the image.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour image was ruined ages ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou try to act like a tough guy, but you\u2019re really just cute.\u201d Jimin reaches out to pinch his cheek. Jungkook grabs his wrist, affronted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin has unintentionally drawn closer, wrist still hanging in Jungkook\u2019s loose grasp. For the briefest of seconds it looks like Jimin\u2019s eyes drop to Jungkook\u2019s lips. But then he\u2019s meeting his gaze again and Jungkook wonders if he imagined it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Jimin singsongs, pulling free. \u201cAnyway, I gotta get to the auto shop, so I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s walking away and Jungkook\u2019s kind of sad that he\u2019s leaving, which is stupid because it\u2019s not like he won\u2019t see him again. He looks down mournfully at his stomach for betraying him with butterflies. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, he tells himself as he resumes biking. It can\u2019t mean anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Goal #2: Make sure Jiminie hyung doesn\u2019t work too hard.</em>\n</p>\n<p>In this case, Jimin ends up inadvertently helping Jungkook just as much as Jungkook helps him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook starts out with little things; stopping by the auto shop to drop off a cup of coffee, interrupting library study marathons with a bag of snacks and distracting YouTube videos when he knows Jimin\u2019s due for a break, helping him out as much as he can at the daycare.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, he\u2019s started working on his essay for Professor Kim. He struggles to brainstorm reasons for why he chose to study art. He loves art; that\u2019s a simple one. Art makes him happy; another obvious one. But he knows that\u2019s not enough, that Kim wants something deeper than that. The answer comes one day when he stops by one of the dance practice rooms with a vitamin drink for Jimin.</p>\n<p>Hoseok told him earlier about Jimin\u2019s troubles regarding a particular piece of choreography for the dance team. Jungkook knows Jimin will kick his own ass for struggling, spend hours trying to improve. So, with Bobby\u2019s example in mind, he decides to check on him and make sure he doesn\u2019t go too far.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s in the middle of dancing when Jungkook stops by the practice room. He can see him through the window in the door, flipping between sharp, strong movements and fluid body rolls. Jungkook has never seen Jimin dance before. He has this sort of sensuality to the way he dances. It\u2019s mesmerizing. Jungkook stands there watching for much longer than he probably should, until the song ends and he pushes open the door.</p>\n<p>Jimin sees him through the mirror and brightens. \u201cHoseok hyung told you I was here, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook drops his bag in the back of the studio, crossing the sleek hardwood floor to the front where Jimin stands in front of the mirrors. Dressed in a loose tank and sweats, he drips with sweat, orange hair plastered to his forehead. \u201cHere.\u201d Jungkook hands him the drink. \u201cYou need to take a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiling me. What\u2019s gotten into you these past weeks, huh?\u201d His eyes twinkle as he drops his head back and gulps the whole thing, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Jungkook mutters, flushing. He sits down and pulls out his phone to scroll through Twitter so he doesn\u2019t look guilty. \u201cI\u2019m just making sure your dumb ass doesn\u2019t drop dead from exhaustion or some shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, my dumb ass appreciates it.\u201d He sits down next to him and wraps his arms around Jungkook\u2019s, nuzzling into his side. \u201cJungkookie, my hero,\u201d he says in an annoyingly high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off.\u201d Jungkook shoves him away but he can\u2019t quite hide the smile. \u201cYou\u2019re sweaty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flails back onto the ground like a starfish. \u201cI\u2019m so tired. I\u2019ll never get this dance down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you will. Hoseok hyung says you always think you won\u2019t but you do anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Hoseok hyung to fight me.\u201d He raises his fists.</p>\n<p>Jungkook covers one small fist with his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re the least intimidating person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Jimin rolls over onto his stomach, pressing his cheek against the cool floor, and sighs. After a moment Jungkook lies down next to him, staring at the fluorescent-lit ceiling, hands under his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really like dancing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come that\u2019s not your focus? The dance program here is pretty good.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s thinking about his essay, and how it would have been easy to keep art as a side focus like Jimin keeps dance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to. But my family needed me to find something more stable to support them quicker. And I like education, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t give up dance, obviously. Now it\u2019s kind of, like, a way for me to escape everyday stuff. Get away from it all for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it clicks, because Jungkook understands that. It\u2019s how he got through high school, especially after Taehyung graduated. He would lose himself in art. Let it engulf him until he could forget the troubles of the day, let it take him somewhere that wasn\u2019t as shitty as his reality. Maybe that\u2019s why he chose to study art\u2014because he wasn\u2019t sure he could survive without it. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Lost in his thoughts, he doesn\u2019t notice Jimin shift closer until he curls into his side, slinging an arm around his waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says into Jungkook\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe vitamin drink was supposed to energize you, not put you to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry harder next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all gross, hyung, get off me.\u201d But there\u2019s no bite to his voice, so Jimin doesn\u2019t move. His breathing slows, his body relaxes. Heat rushes to Jungkook\u2019s face. It\u2019s not like the night after the party, when Jimin was drunk and Jungkook was buzzed and it was that time of night where anything could happen, free of meaning. The day isn\u2019t made for secrets.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s two in the afternoon and he can\u2019t hide from the way his heart aches at the warmth of Jimin\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Goal #3: Make sure Jiminie hyung has fun.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The third goal is the hardest. Jimin doesn\u2019t have time for fun. And now that Jungkook\u2019s working harder in school (at least he is with Professor Kim\u2019s class, anyway\u2014baby steps), along with the daycare and tutoring Chan, he doesn\u2019t really have time, either. He convinces Jimin to spend a night watching anime with him and Taehyung after they\u2019ve studied, but that\u2019s as far as he gets for a while.</p>\n<p>An idea hits him when he\u2019s with Chan one evening. He takes his moped to his home every Saturday with a portfolio bag full of art supplies, and lately Chan has really started to open up to him. Jungkook almost thinks of him as a little brother; a novel feeling, since he\u2019s always been the youngest.</p>\n<p>On the particular Saturday he gets the idea, Chan seems off. He\u2019s not as engaged, barely doing what Jungkook tells him, saying little more than a few words at a time. Eventually Jungkook asks him to put his pencils down.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Channie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have a shi\u2014a bad week in school?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chan shrugs.</p>\n<p>Jungkook nudges him. \u201cNeed me to teach you how to punch someone the right way?\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles a little. \u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you need to punch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just some guys in my class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre they annoying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey just, um, make fun of me and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook snorts. \u201cWhy, \u2018cause you\u2019re cooler than them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey just think I\u2019m weird, I guess. \u2018Cause I don\u2019t really like the same stuff as them. Or hang out with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>A resigned sort of smile tugs at the corner of Jungkook\u2019s lips. \u201cYeah. That happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like the stuff they like. Maybe I should try to?\u201d He looks to Jungkook like he holds the answer.</p>\n<p>But Jungkook\u2019s still trying to figure that out himself. He could tell him what everyone always told Jungkook growing up\u2014<em>fuck what people think, be yourself</em>. Only he knows firsthand that it\u2019s not as easy as people say it is. Being yourself has consequences for people who don\u2019t fit the standards of those around them. So what he gives Chan instead is a variation on Professor Kim\u2019s words. \u201cDo what you think is best. But whatever you do, just make sure you\u2019re not hurting yourself or anyone else while you do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chan nods. Jungkook\u2019s not sure if he understands, or if he ever will, but that\u2019s the best he can give him for now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, whenever I used to feel down I\u2019d go to the Han River and draw.\u201d He used to run to the river a lot in high school, with his headphones and a sketchbook in hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes. Wanna give it a try?\u201d</p>\n<p>With his mother\u2019s approval, he takes him down to the river by bus, where they sit and sketch together. Looking out over the water, at the passersby along the paths, Jungkook thinks it would be a nice place to bring Jimin.</p>\n<p>So that night he shows up at Dream Bean unannounced, just in time for the end of Jimin\u2019s shift. He takes Jimin\u2019s backpack from him and slings it over his shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says without preamble, walking off with a jerk of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Jimin looks like he wants to object, but he\u2019s following Jungkook anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe river.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I want to. We can grab ramen at a convenience store on the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Surprisingly enough, Jimin doesn\u2019t argue further. He just shuffles along after Jungkook and fights him for the window seat when the bus comes, ducking past and plopping down before he can do anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can sit on my lap, if you want.\u201d He flashes him a cheeky grin.</p>\n<p>Jungkook curls his lip and falls into the seat next to him. \u201cI\u2019m only letting you off because you\u2019re my hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when has that ever stopped you?\u201d</p>\n<p>As the bus jolts to a start, Jimin leans his head against the window and closes his eyes. A few nasty bumps later, he sits back up, rubbing his temple and grumbling. Jungkook sniffs and lifts his shoulder, the one brushing against Jimin\u2019s. Jimin looks at him. He wiggles his shoulder again. Jimin blinks. Fed up with the blank stare that meets him, Jungkook stretches his arm out to pull Jimin\u2019s head onto his shoulder.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s surprised to see Jimin\u2019s cheeks turn pink.</p>\n<p>They stop at a convenience store first, where they microwave cups of instant ramen and tteokbokki. From there they walk down to the river. Despite the hour, the odd group mills along the bordering paths or reclines on the grass. They find a secluded spot on the bottom of some steps leading down to the water. Jungkook inhales his ramen pretty quickly. He jumps down the side of the steps to the riverbank, kicking around the pebbles and dirt. With a calculating look, he shifts around to find a flat stone and flicks it across the water. It skips six times.</p>\n<p>Jimin exclaims, pointing with his chopsticks at the ripples left in the water. \u201cThat was so cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you teach me?\u201d He sets down his ramen and joins Jungkook.</p>\n<p>He crouches and digs around for another stone. \u201cYou have to find one that\u2019s kind of flat. Like this.\u201d Jimin takes the one he proffers, examining it carefully. Jungkook hops up, brushing dirt from his knees. \u201cThen just flick it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He demonstrates the wrist movement a few times. Jimin tries to copy it, but the rock sinks after the first plop. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gotta, like, flick it. Don\u2019t throw it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries (and fails) a few more times before giving up with a pout. \u201cHow come you\u2019re good at everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard.\u201d He rubs the back of his head, embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Jimin returns to his ramen with a huff. Jungkook joins him before long, sprawling back on the steps, holding himself up by his elbows. The city lights flicker beautifully over the water, a medley of oranges and yellows and whites blurring together. Not far from them, a well-lit bridge stretches across the river, busy with traffic even at night. It\u2019s a little chilly despite the season, a cool breeze ruffling their hair. In the distance they can hear cars honking but it seems awfully far away. Jungkook can pretend it\u2019s just them, him and Jimin and the water.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d Jimin shatters the quiet so suddenly Jungkook takes a moment to answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe guy you said you liked. In high school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remember that?\u201d Jungkook inspects him carefully, but Jimin doesn\u2019t look at him, swirling the last vestiges of ramen around with his chopsticks. His side profile is stunning. Sharp, slender jaw; straight, small nose. Those full lips, parted slightly. The rings in his ears, one in the lobe and one hugging the curve of his ear, glinting prettily. The thought hits him like a tidal wave, powerful and sudden: Jimin\u2019s the most beautiful boy he\u2019s ever seen.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t drunk enough to forget.\u201d He sounds regretful, like he wanted to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what was he like\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shifts, lying back, crossing his arms under his head. The steps dig into his back but he doesn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s been a while since he thought so closely about the boy who broke his heart. Mostly he tries to forget the details. \u201cHe was the kind of guy who commanded attention. Walked into a room and everyone looked. Everyone liked him, everyone knew him. He was so good at talking, you know? He could talk his way out of anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why\u2019d you like him?\u201d Jimin asks, quieter this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t anything like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, baby.\u201d He finally looks at Jungkook, tenderness etched into the soft lines of his face. He reaches for him, gentle fingers brushing the hair from Jungkook\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was the kid who hid in the back of class and he\u2014he glowed. I guess I thought being around him would let some of that glow rub off on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got enough glow on your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHard to remember that, sometimes. Especially back then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you? What about that guy you used to like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hand drops to his side. \u201cI would have done anything for him.\u201d He pokes the empty plastic bowl with his chopsticks, harder than necessary. \u201cI did a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do to you?\u201d Jungkook can\u2019t quite mask the anger that laces his tone. Jimin\u2019s voice, thin and wobbly, still echoes in his mind from the night at the pojangmacha. <em>Sometimes I still cry about it. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Namjoon hyung warned me. The first time he ever met him, he said, <em>don\u2019t fuck with that guy, Jiminie, I don\u2019t like him</em>. But I didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve made that mistake.\u201d He thinks about Hoseok\u2019s warning, months ago, and how he had ignored that, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were just fucking at first, you know? Nothing else. But, um, I get attached to people. Pretty easily. Fell hard. He took advantage of that. Made a lot of promises I was stupid enough to believe. <em>You and me, babe, we\u2019ll go places.</em> He used to say that a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course not. I was just a lay to him. But he liked the attention. Liked knowing I\u2019d do anything for him. So he kept me around.\u201d Jimin pauses, inhaling a shaky breath, his eyes downcast.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about it if it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always gonna be hard.\u201d He rests his eyes, then opens them. \u201cHe kept me around while he was fucking around with everyone else and\u2014and laughing behind my back, probably. Me, the stupid, clueless boy who thought I meant something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was, um, he was really manipulative. He\u2019d twist things his way so I\u2019d do what he wanted. Make me feel bad for saying no, like I was the unreasonable one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook realizes his hands are shaking. He clenches them into fists, hiding them under his legs. \u201cHow\u2019d you get out of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBobby, actually.\u201d He smiles a little, playing with the rings on his fingers. \u201cHe\u2019d already transferred schools by then, and he saw him. At a party at his university, messing with someone else. Bobby didn\u2019t want to hurt me so he told Yoongi hyung instead. Yoongi hyung knocked some sense into me. He was kind of mean about it, actually\u2014you know how Yoongi hyung gets. But I think I needed the bluntness; it woke me up. And I finally said no without feeling bad for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It makes sense, now, why Namjoon and Yoongi are so protective of Jimin. Why Yoongi had so mistrusted Jungkook\u2019s intentions. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have class with him this semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook sits up so abruptly he startles Jimin into glancing at him. \u201cHe goes to school with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt probably makes him really happy, hearing all the rumors about me. Knowing I couldn\u2019t get close to anyone after him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying when I tell people I\u2019m busy. That\u2019s part of it, a lot of it. But part of it is also that I just can\u2019t, you know? I put everything I had into him, trusted him with everything. I can\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you turned Bobby down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. He was\u2014he was too similar. Fuck buddy turned into something else. It scared me. Even though, logically, I know Bobby\u2019s not like that. I know I would be happy with him. But I just\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here I was complaining about a guy who laughed at my confession. That\u2019s nothing compared to what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t compare. That\u2019s not how this stuff works.\u201d He jabs a chopstick at him, and Jungkook finds himself smiling despite everything. \u201cYou hurt and I hurt and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNamjoon hyung\u2019s rubbing off on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe reads his philosophy textbooks out loud when he\u2019s studying. Can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you here to have fun. Now look at us.\u201d Jungkook fiddles with the hem of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you still have to see him around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Jimin rubs his eyes, finally putting his empty bowl and chopsticks into the plastic bag they\u2019re using for trash. \u201cI\u2019ve only got, like, two weeks left now? Then I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSemester\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about next semester? Is he graduating?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tilts his head, brows furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d His chest clenches and he\u2019s not sure what\u2019s coming but he knows he doesn\u2019t want to hear the next words that leave Jimin\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m graduating. This semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares at him, mouth forming words that don\u2019t come out. Then, \u201cYou\u2019ve still got second semester. There\u2019s still second semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m graduating a semester early, Jungkookie. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been busting my ass with all these extra classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok and Namjoon have stayed back an extra year but here\u2019s Jimin saying he\u2019s leaving early. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta go back to Busan. Find a job. Help my family. It was possible to finish early with some extra work, so I decided to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His eyes are wide. He looks it. \u201cI thought you knew. Everyone knows, I just assumed you knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody told me.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s arms slip around himself, wrapping tight. How could he have missed it? How could he have gone all these months without hearing anything? \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie\u2014\u201d Jimin reaches for him, but Jungkook stands up. It was one thing knowing Jimin would be graduating at the end of the year like Taehyung, but to have it pushed upon him so suddenly?</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s acting like this but he can\u2019t help it. It hurts so much and he doesn\u2019t know why, it\u2019s not like Jimin\u2019s going forever, it\u2019s not like\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p>\n<p>He plucks the plastic bag from Jimin\u2019s side and walks off toward a trash can on the walkway without waiting. He doesn\u2019t look back once, all the way to the bus stop, but he can hear Jimin\u2019s steps close behind him. He stands near the curb waiting for the bus; he thinks Jimin sits on the bench but he doesn\u2019t check.</p>\n<p>When the bus comes he beelines to the back, slipping into a seat by the window and crossing his arms over his chest. Jimin hesitates in the aisle; Jungkook can feel his eyes on him but he doesn\u2019t look. His own eyes are burning. He blinks furiously. In the end, Jimin doesn\u2019t sit next to him. He moves quietly to a seat three rows in front of him. Back on campus, he gets off first and doesn\u2019t wait.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay, Jungkook?\u201d Hyejin says when he walks into the building.</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, kicks open the door to the stairs, and runs all the way up to his floor. When he enters the apartment Taehyung\u2019s sitting there with his laptop and glasses, wearing Jungkook\u2019s Pokemon onesie again.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, you\u2019ve gotta see this\u2014hey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you wearing my onesie?\u201d Jungkook says. He kicks off his shoes by the door furiously. \u201cI told you not to wear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s just beginning to frown when Jungkook starts crying. The tears turn into heaving sobs that tear from his throat as he sinks to sit on the ground in front of the entrance, wiping furiously at his eyes in vain because they won\u2019t stop coming. Taehyung flies to him, tugging him into his arms and running desperate hands over his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkookie, tell me what happened, are you hurt\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>When he was younger and Taehyung would tease him, he\u2019d get all pouty and his eyes would water so Taehyung would mockingly ask, <em>Jungkookie, are you crying</em>? And that\u2019s all it took to make the tears come. He hated it, hated looking like a baby. He hasn\u2019t cried like that in a long time.</p>\n<p>But with Taehyung kissing his hair and murmuring nonsense words of comfort, he lets himself cry until his throat is hoarse and his head throbs with pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong, Jungkookie, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s crying because Jimin\u2019s leaving or because he finally understands and he\u2019s terrified, so, so terrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like him. Hyung, I like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He whispers it into the darkness of his room like a secret. The words curl around him, suffocating. Now that they\u2019ve left him they\u2019re a part of the air. He can\u2019t take them back.</p>\n<p>He holds out his fingers and counts off all the reasons he can\u2019t tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns over and buries his face into his pillow, inhaling a trembling breath. No matter that he wants to. No matter that he\u2019d give anything to be the reason for Jimin\u2019s smile. Because even in a perfect world, if Jimin liked him and he weren\u2019t leaving, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Jimin\u2019s past won\u2019t let him open his heart to anyone.</p>\n<p>But how he wants to; oh, how he wants to. How he wishes that instead of whispering a denial into the stifling air of his room, he were whispering a confession into Jimin\u2019s lips. Now that he\u2019s let himself feel it, the <em>want</em> rushes over him until he\u2019s drowning in it. And he knows it\u2019ll only get worse.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s best that Jimin\u2019s leaving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook dabs a speck of blue paint on the corner of the canvas, covered in a patchwork of old, torn paper. With his tongue sticking out from the corner of his mouth, he blends it carefully into the neighboring green. The sound of someone\u2019s foot kicking the door nearly startles him into dropping his brush. He spins around. Taehyung walks toward him holding two cups of to-go coffee with the Dream Bean logo plastered on the sides, a face mask over his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. Here.\u201d He hands him one of the cups. Jungkook peeks inside; it\u2019s an Americano. He wonders if Jimin was the one who made it. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here all day. Take a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances around him, suddenly realizing that the small studio is now empty. When he had arrived there early morning (not because he woke up but because he never fell asleep), a girl worked on a tissue paper collage by the window, another sketched a still life, and a boy had been in the middle of a painting. Now it\u2019s just him, standing alone with his canvas and easel in the corner, old t-shirt and sweats covered in stray splotches of paint.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung slides into one of the rolling chairs in front of the white table that protrudes from the wall of the studio, stretching from one end around the corner to the next. \u201cHow\u2019s the project going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, all right. I\u2019ve just got three more portraits to add, and I\u2019m not really happy with the blending.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks fine to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook brushes his hair out of his eyes, leaving a wet streak of paint on his forehead in the process. \u201cNah, it\u2019s not there yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake a break, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanna finish a bit more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you even eaten anything all day?\u201d</p>\n<p>He scuffs the toes of his Timberlands against the paint-covered cement floor and thinks about it. \u201cI had breakfast. I think. Actually, never mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go to the dining hall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a bit.\u201d He tries not to sound annoyed as he turns back to his canvas.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin was asking about you.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pauses in reapplying paint to his brush. So Jimin did make the coffee. \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d His tone is carefully neutral.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Taehyung says it gently, the way his voice gets when he\u2019s actually acting like a hyung. \u201cIt\u2019s been a week. He looked upset.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook dabs another speck of blue elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said you weren\u2019t answering his calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>He applies too much blue and swears, jabbing at the spot with his pinky to catch the excess and leaving a nasty smear.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, look at me,\u201d Taehyung says very seriously. Jungkook sighs and turns to him. \u201cStop avoiding him. Stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the fucking point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fucking point is that he\u2019s your fucking friend.\u201d Taehyung hardly ever gets like this. Something in his interaction with Jimin must have pissed him off enough to confront Jungkook. \u201cYou can\u2019t just run away from shit for the rest of your life. If you\u2019re not gonna man the fuck up and tell him, then at least have the decency to spend his last days here as a good friend. You\u2019ve just wasted a whole week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t get it. He doesn\u2019t know what happened the last time Jungkook confessed. Jimin is the only person Jungkook has ever told. So Taehyung doesn\u2019t understand why Jungkook can\u2019t <em>man the fuck up</em>. \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit acting like a kid, Jeon Jungkook. He\u2019s graduating in one week and if you hurt him like this you\u2019re going to regret it forever. Confess or don\u2019t confess, that\u2019s your problem. But don\u2019t shut him out. He doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung grabs his coffee and marches to the door. Halfway there he turns back, grabs Jungkook\u2019s coffee, too, and resumes his exit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you taking my coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bought it!\u201d Taehyung sniffs. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking.\u201d At the door, Taehyung sticks his tongue out, blows a raspberry, and leaves.</p>\n<p>Jungkook splutters. A minute too late he yells, \u201cSuck my dick!\u201d</p>\n<p>But Taehyung\u2019s already gone and he only succeeds in scandalizing a professor passing by.</p>\n<p>That night he stands in front of Jimin\u2019s apartment door. He raises his hand to knock. Drops it. Raises it again. Huffs in frustration and runs a hand through his hair, walks to the end of the hall toward the staircase then back again. It\u2019s a stupid idea; he doesn\u2019t have any way to explain the last week. <em>Hey, hyung, sorry I just wasted a whole week we could have spent together because I realized I really fucking like you but it doesn\u2019t matter anyway because I\u2019m scared and you\u2019re scared and you\u2019re leaving</em>. He snorts quietly, spins on his heel, and marches for the staircase. But halfway there he thinks about Taehyung\u2019s stupid disappointed face, the one where he pouts a little and his eyebrows form this weird shape and he just looks like an idiot but somehow manages to make Jungkook feel bad anyway.</p>\n<p>And he thinks about the way Jimin looks when he\u2019s upset but doesn\u2019t want to show it. How he gets stiff and quiet but his pretty eyes give everything away, and his lips will quirk in that sad way. <em>He doesn\u2019t deserve that</em>.</p>\n<p>Jungkook shuffles back to the door and knocks, three quick raps. He waits for a minute; no telltale noises sound on the other side. With a sigh, he stuffs his hands in his pockets and turns away.</p>\n<p>The door opens with a bang. \u201cJeon Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Namjoon, leaning in the doorjamb with ink-stained fingers and a pair of massive glasses perched on his nose. \u201cHyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you looking for Jimin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook tries to move past him, taking that as an invitation, but Namjoon takes him by the shoulder and pushes him back. He crosses his arms and stands there, blocking the way. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook,\u201d Namjoon says again. \u201cWe need to have a talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of talk?\u201d Jungkook sniffs, looking anywhere but at Namjoon\u2019s face. He scuffs the ground with the toe of his boot.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout you and your coping mechanisms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou find out Jiminie\u2019s graduating and you hide for a week. Running away isn\u2019t exactly healthy, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sinks into himself, shoulders tight. He feels small. \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s really upset. Thinks he did something wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he didn\u2019t. Jungkookie, you can\u2019t run away from things that make you sad. You have to face them to overcome them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Half of him wants to say something snarky like <em>thanks, Mr. Philosophy Major</em>. But he knows Namjoon\u2019s just being a hyung. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Jiminie, come here,\u201d Namjoon yells back into the apartment. Then he says to Jungkook, \u201cYou should be grateful Yoongi hyung\u2019s not here. He would have kicked your ass to hell and back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin steps out of the room in an oversized sweater, hair ruffled and lips swollen like he was sleeping not that long ago. His socked feet slide against the floor. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d He sees Jungkook, and he stops. \u201cJungkookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon claps Jungkook\u2019s shoulder and slips into the bedroom, closing the door behind him. Jungkook stands in the doorway. Now that he\u2019s looking at him, soft and tired, he doesn\u2019t know how to act. Now that he knows the burst of butterflies he gets every time Jimin looks at him actually mean something after all. \u201cHyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you haven\u2019t been picking up my calls?\u201d His mouth curves into a frown, his voice pitched high. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry, hyung, I just\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole. I only have a week left here, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy have you been ignoring me?\u201d His voice gets higher with every question.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just\u2014you caught me off guard. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know you were leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you fucking ignore me for a week? Right, that makes so much sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. I know it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s lower lip wobbles. His nose scrunches up. He spins around, standing there with his hand on the couch, his back to Jungkook. And then Jungkook\u2019s moving toward him with quick steps, sliding his arms around Jimin\u2019s waist and pulling him into his chest. Jimin stiffens, breath caught in a gasp, but he doesn\u2019t pull away. His back is warm against Jungkook\u2019s chest, and in his arms he feels so incredibly small. It\u2019s so easy to hold Jimin like it means nothing, even if it makes Jungkook\u2019s heart thump so hard he\u2019s sure Jimin can feel it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmurs into Jimin\u2019s hair, tickling his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin relaxes, leaning his weight into Jungkook. Jungkook\u2019s arms tighten, holding him up. The sleeves of Jimin\u2019s sweater are soft against his skin. He thinks it would be nice to stay like this forever. But of course nothing lasts forever, and after a moment Jimin turns around in his hold. They\u2019re close, so close their chests brush. Jimin reaches up and threads a hand through Jungkook\u2019s hair, from his forehead to the nape of his neck. A shiver runs up Jungkook\u2019s spine and he knows Jimin feels it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>His hand stays there, curled in the hair at his nape. It would be easy to kiss him. They\u2019re already breathing the same air. He could just lean down the slightest bit and their noses would brush, and then their lips, too. He could pull his hips against his own and kiss him like he\u2019s wanted to since the first time he saw him, sitting in the dining hall reading an English book that made his brow furrow in frustration. He realizes he\u2019s staring at Jimin\u2019s lips and he thinks Jimin\u2019s staring at his, too. It would be easy.</p>\n<p>They pull away at the same time.</p>\n<p>Jimin turns back to the couch, holding onto it and clearing his throat. Red spreads from his cheeks down to his collarbones. Maybe it means something, maybe Jimin feels something after all. But in the end it doesn\u2019t matter. He felt something for Bobby, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been studying for finals?\u201d Jimin asks, a rapid change in subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah. Do you\u2014do you want to study together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air. It only took one week for him to miss that smile; he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do when Jimin leaves. \u201cYeah. Let\u2019s study.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook sits in the hall outside Professor Kim\u2019s office with the other ten people in his class, linoleum floor cold against his ass. Kim wanted to meet with each student individually to turn in their final projects and talk to them about the semester. He\u2019s nervous. He can\u2019t remember the last time he worked so hard on something for school. The past three days he spent cooped up in the studio with Jimin coming by to study near him every now and then.</p>\n<p>One of the girls in class whose name he can never remember steps out of Kim\u2019s office and says, \u201cJungkook, your turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hops to his feet and carefully lifts his canvas, carrying it into the office. Professor Kim smiles when he enters, his eyes crinkling. \u201cWhat have you got for me, Jeon Jungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook turns the canvas around and holds it up. Kim looks over it, scribbling down some notes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, talk to me. How are you showing courage?\u201d</p>\n<p>He props it against the back wall and stands by it, fiddling with his fingers. \u201cWell, um, when I think of courage I think of people. Like, people I know who are courageous. So I made a collage of portraits.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks back at his painting. Over the patchwork of old paper covering the canvas, he\u2019s painted a collage of faces, soft edges in blurred acrylic. There\u2019s his mother because if anyone\u2019s courageous it\u2019s her, dealing with work and two sons and his father\u2019s family. Taehyung for the way he stands up for what he believes in, and the way he would stand in front of Jungkook to take the punches meant for him. Hoseok for all the love he has in him, because it\u2019s not easy loving everyone. His middle school teacher who first encouraged him to pursue art and argued with his parents when they spoke out against it. And Jimin. Jimin because despite everything he\u2019s been through, he still manages to smile and let someone like Jungkook into his life when he doesn\u2019t deserve it at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on it,\u201d Professor Kim says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re courageous?\u201d</p>\n<p>Professor Kim Seokjin, always meddling. Jungkook has found that he doesn\u2019t really mind it. He shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re pretty courageous, Jungkook.\u201d He beckons, and Jungkook takes the seat across from him. \u201cJust look at how much you\u2019ve grown in one semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook rubs the back of his head and blushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the paper you turned in last week was fantastic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. And, uh, thanks for all your help this semester. If I\u2019ve grown, a lot of it\u2019s because of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Professor Kim beams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could still tell him.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s not much time left, but he could still tell Jimin the truth. That\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking the day they throw Jimin a graduation party\u2014a small affair for the six of them that have somehow become a group over the course of the semester, beer and fried chicken and anime and laughter. It\u2019s nice. For a little while they pretend that things aren\u2019t going to change.</p>\n<p>But they are, and when the night\u2019s over Jungkook can think of nothing else. Everyone around him is laughing and happy and so is he, but a part of him is so acutely aware of their impermanence. Jimin will leave and then second semester will come and go and Taehyung and Namjoon and Hoseok will leave, too. Sparked by Jimin\u2019s graduation, he understands with startling clarity the inevitability of change. They won\u2019t be laughing, careless college students forever. Maybe one day they won\u2019t even know each other. Maybe one day he\u2019ll think fondly back to this moment and wonder where everyone else is and wonder if they\u2019re doing all right. <em>We had fun together</em>, he\u2019ll think, <em>it\u2019s been a while</em>. One day he\u2019ll be somewhere different, someone different, and so will they.</p>\n<p>After his second year in university ends, Jungkook will be alone. He knows a lot of people on campus. He has people he can call up if he\u2019s looking for a party or looking for good alcohol or good sex. But in the end Taehyung and Hoseok were his only real friends, the only ones he wanted to spend his down time with. Jimin will leave and then they\u2019ll leave and Jungkook will have to learn to fend for himself.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like high school all over again. For the first two years he had Taehyung by his side, and he didn\u2019t need anyone else. Taehyung warded off the bullying and sat with him during lunch and winked from the windows when he passed his classroom. But then he graduated and Jungkook spent the next two years trying to function without him. In the end, he did all right. He broke out of his shell a little and made some acquaintances to pass the time. But it wasn\u2019t the same.</p>\n<p>It won\u2019t be the same, after this year. After this semester.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re growing up now. At least after high school he had university to anticipate. Now there\u2019s only real life. Struggle and more struggle, like he sees the adults around him endure. And when life gets in the way maybe he won\u2019t ever find friends like these again.</p>\n<p>But for the time being he revels in their togetherness. He laughs at the way Hoseok does his best impression of Yoongi, and the way he slings his arm around Jimin\u2019s neck and bumps their heads together by accident when he laughs too hard. He yells along with everyone else when Namjoon almost spills an entire bottle of beer all over the carpet, snorts at the way Yoongi huffs at all of them in exasperation but throws them the fondest glances when he thinks they aren\u2019t looking. Smiles at Taehyung when he gets on the table to dance for his favorite anime opening. And watches Jimin, his bright eyes and offended exclamations when someone teases him, his body-flinging laugh and snarky comments.</p>\n<p>But the night ends like all things, and they\u2019re saying goodbye. Hugging and making jokes to ward off the sadness. Jimin holds Hoseok and Taehyung for a while and Jungkook stands to the side, watching. Then Jimin turns to him and says his name, quietly. The air around them grows heavy and Yoongi shifts, Taehyung clears his throat, Namjoon looks away. They step toward each other at the same time, him and Jimin.</p>\n<p>He tucks him into his arms carefully at first, but Jimin holds on tight, so he lets himself feel. He holds him to his chest, face buried into his hair, inhaling the scent of shampoo and <em>Jimin</em>. Jimin\u2019s small hands clutch the back of his shirt, breathing into his shoulder. Standing like that he could forget there\u2019s anyone else but the two of them, anyone else but Jimin, so small in his arms. But things are changing, and Jungkook has to change with them.</p>\n<p>He had thought, foolishly, hopefully, that it might have been fate that led them together. But in the end it was just a series of stupid coincidences and stupider decisions. Fate hasn\u2019t aligned for them to work out. There are an amalgamation of hesitations, of locked-up hurt and flawed hearts that keep them from each other. It\u2019s not the right time. It might never be.</p>\n<p>He lets Jimin go. He could still tell him, but he doesn\u2019t. He lets Jimin go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Timberlands, Jungkook learned quite some time ago, are not good running shoes.</p>\n<p>He weaves around a girl on a bike and leaps over some guy sitting on the sidewalk drawing in chalk. His boots pinch his feet but he\u2019s making pretty impressive speed, if he does say so himself. A girl carrying groceries steps onto the sidewalk just outside the apartment building, and Jungkook careens to the side to avoid her, bouncing back to zoom inside. He takes the stairs two at a time, wonders if running like Naruto does will make him go any faster.</p>\n<p>Not that he\u2019s on a time limit, not really. Jimin\u2019s bus doesn\u2019t leave for another hour.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to see him today. Last night had been the end. But this morning he woke up and realized he couldn\u2019t let some asshole he made the mistake of liking in high school get in the way of right now. If he lets his fear govern him, then he hasn\u2019t changed much at all. <em>Just look at how much you\u2019ve grown in one semester</em>, Seokjin had said. Jungkook wants those words to be true.</p>\n<p>Because even if Jimin says no, at least he\u2019ll have tried. At least he can walk away and say that he didn\u2019t cave into fear. That he was as courageous as all the people he loves.</p>\n<p>He skids to a halt outside the apartment door, nearly stumbling over in his haste. He knocks quickly. Yoongi opens the door. He\u2019s clearly seconds away from making a dry comment about Jungkook\u2019s out-of-breath state, but Jungkook beats him to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta\u2014gotta talk to Jimin,\u201d he gasps.</p>\n<p>Yoongi gives him a look but lets him in. Jimin\u2019s sitting on top of his suitcase, legs straddling the handle. His eyes widen in surprise as he stands up. \u201cJungkook, what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I talk to you? Privately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s brows furrow, but he points outside the apartment. \u201cGo in the hall.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Jungkook goes, still trying to catch his breath. Jimin follows, letting the door click shut behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>The words spill out of him in a jumble because if he speaks any slower he\u2019ll lose courage. \u201cHyung I like you a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s never been good at hiding how he feels. The play of emotions is written across his face so clearly. Confusion, then understanding, then the telltale drooping of sadness and frustration. Jungkook pulls into himself. He knows what\u2019s coming. Two for two. \u201cJungkookie, I thought you understood.\u201d His voice cracks, his eyes trained resolutely on the wall behind Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do. I do understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you doing this to me? I\u2019m leaving in an hour.\u201d He sounds so pained that Jungkook regrets it. Maybe he had only been thinking of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let you go without telling you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You know I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shoves his hands in his pockets, clenching them into fists against his thighs. His shoulders scrunch together so tight it hurts. Even though he expected it, nothing quite prepared him for the way his heart sinks, swooping to his feet like dead weight. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He had hoped, anyway.</p>\n<p>When he looks up, Jimin is crying. \u201cHyung, I\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it.\u201d Lower lip trembling, red spreading across his nose, lashes wet. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much I like you, I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. Maybe we can\u2014we can work around it. Take things slow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have an answer for that. Defeated, he leans back against the wall, slouching over. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThinking about\u2014thinking about being with someone again makes me want to vomit.\u201d The words come out distorted through his tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took Jungkook a year and a half just to move past a failed confession. Maybe he\u2019s asking too much of Jimin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo home.\u201d The tremble leaves his voice. He wipes his tears on the back of his hand and stands straighter.</p>\n<p>When he turns his back, Jungkook crumbles. \u201cHave a safe trip, Jiminie hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pauses at the door. His shoulders shake. \u201cThanks, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>then</em>\n</p>\n<p>Park Jimin and Love had a bitter past.</p>\n<p>In preschool, he asked a boy in his class to marry him. Of course, at the time he didn\u2019t really know what marriage was beyond that it required a ring (he used blades of grass) and that it meant they got to walk past the swing-set while the other kids threw flowers from the school garden. The boy said no, Jimin wasn\u2019t cute enough, and the teacher told him boys didn\u2019t marry each other anyway.</p>\n<p>As a rather naive eleven-year-old, he fell for a boy who was thirteen and had a skateboard and smoked behind school during lunch. Jimin thought he was the coolest boy he had ever seen, and the boy thought Jimin was a kid. So that didn\u2019t really work out, either.</p>\n<p>In high school, he fell in love with his best friend and was very gently turned down. The friendship, unfortunately, never quite recovered. At the start of high school, they spent every evening at each other\u2019s houses; by graduation, Jimin didn\u2019t even know where she was going to university.</p>\n<p>Then he met Minsoo, and everything went to shit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>now</em>\n</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t delete Jungkook\u2019s number. He looks at it enough that he could probably recite it by heart. He could text him or call him but he doesn\u2019t. Jungkook doesn\u2019t, either. Sometimes he lies in bed and locks and unlocks, locks and unlocks his phone in the hopes that at some point Jungkook might message him. Sometimes he types out a whole message, his finger hovering over the send key, then deletes it.</p>\n<p>Talking would make things difficult. Talking would keep the fire surging in his heart every time he thinks about Jungkook alive, keep him from letting Jungkook fade into memory. He probably doesn\u2019t even want to talk to Jimin after the way he left.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when he\u2019s typing out a message that won\u2019t ever get sent, he thinks about their last conversation. <em>I couldn\u2019t let you go without telling you. </em>It would have been easier if he had. Jimin could have held onto the shred of doubt that Jungkook liked him back, but now there\u2019s nothing. It hurts more knowing they could have had something if Jimin wasn\u2019t so scared.</p>\n<p><em>Maybe we can work around it. Take things slow</em>. He wishes Jungkook weren\u2019t so sweet. He wishes Jungkook had fallen for someone better than Jimin, someone who wouldn\u2019t break his heart because of an old fear. The quicker he forgets about Jimin, the better.</p>\n<p>So they don\u2019t talk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>then</em>\n</p>\n<p>The rumors spread like wildfire.</p>\n<p>He turned down three date invitations in one semester, and apparently that was all it took for people to talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard Park Jimin refuses to date anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s busy but I think he\u2019s just a prude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he used to be such a party boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s secretly in love with someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard an idol asked him to date but he even turned <em>her</em> down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before long, everyone in his major and quite a few people outside of it knew he didn\u2019t date. It wasn\u2019t until he got asked out by a boy in one of his classes that he understood it had become something of a game. The boy approached him while he sat on a bench outside the gym. His friends stood ten feet away, closer to the gym entrance. The guy glanced back at them before he asked Jimin, \u201cHey, do you wanna get coffee some time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin could see his friends laughing. They were whispering to each other. The guy looked back again. \u201cNo,\u201d Jimin said, coolly, because he didn\u2019t like the way it had turned into a spectacle.</p>\n<p>He accepted his defeat and slunk back to his friends. Jimin grabbed his sports bag and prepared to leave when he saw it\u2014money passed from the guy to one of his friends. It was a bet. He stared at them so long they noticed, nudged each other, and turned away.</p>\n<p>Jimin walked back home with a strange sort of burning in his eyes.</p>\n<p>Namjoon suggested that it may have been Minsoo fueling the rumor mill as post break-up revenge. Jimin figured it was only one more way for Minsoo to ruin his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>now</em>\n</p>\n<p>Change is hard. Four years away from Busan have turned it into a new city. Most of his old high school friends are gone, scattered around the country. Falling back into a rhythm at home with his parents proves difficult, especially in the time it takes him to find a job. But it\u2019s a fresh start. Maybe that\u2019s what he needs to move on. Maybe he can finally stop thinking about Minsoo if he doesn\u2019t have to see him every day.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when he talks to the others, they\u2019ll tell him about Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t party all that much anymore,\u201d Hoseok says. \u201cHe only goes if it\u2019s with us. I think he has more fun that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting an apartment together next year,\u201d Yoongi tells him. That makes Jimin start in surprise, because Yoongi takes a while to warm up to people. \u201cWhat? I\u2019ve still got two goddamn years left for this graduate program and all of you assholes are ditching us, so. Better him than some idiot who pisses on the floor or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which in Yoongi-Speak translates to <em>I miss you</em>, <em>he\u2019s a nice kid and we\u2019re friends now</em>.</p>\n<p>And two months after Jimin leaves, he receives a text from Jungkook himself. It\u2019s long and comes out as three messages.</p>\n<p><strong>jungkookie</strong><em><br>\n</em>hey hyung i hope you\u2019re doing well. i know you probably don\u2019t want to talk to me but i just wanted to tell you something. today i saw the guy i used to like and i didn\u2019t feel anything at all. i wasn\u2019t even mad. it took a year and a half but i don\u2019t care anymore</p>\n<p><strong>jungkookie</strong><br>\nand that made me really happy. so i thought about you. and even though it\u2019s hard now i just want you to know that one day maybe you\u2019ll see that guy again and you won\u2019t care either.</p>\n<p><strong>jungkookie</strong><br>\ni\u2019m not saying this because i think you\u2019ll want to date me or something but i just want you to be happy, that\u2019s all. so i hope one day you won\u2019t have to be scared anymore.</p>\n<p>The message makes him cry. Jungkook doesn\u2019t like talking about his feelings. He\u2019s not one to send sappy messages or send messages at all, really. But Jimin cries because he\u2019s missing out on someone like Jungkook, and because he\u2019s so happy that Jungkook\u2019s moved on, and because he wants to do that, too. He wants to know what it feels like to not care.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>then</em>\n</p>\n<p>The first day of his last semester of university, Jimin walked into his senior seminar for education majors and saw him. Sitting in the back, carefree, laughing at something the girl next to him said. Jimin froze, feet like lead, and before him he could see the rest of the semester stretching out\u2014endless, impossible, full of bitter remembrances. It wasn\u2019t until another student bumped into his back that he finally started moving to take a seat as far from Minsoo as he could get.</p>\n<p>Minsoo saw him, he knew it. All throughout class he could feel his eyes prickling his skin, making the hair on the back of his neck stand. Jimin fixed his gaze resolutely on the front of the classroom, stiff and unmoving for the next two hours. When the teacher called on him, he answered in a pitiful stammer. He tried to slip out quickly at the end of class but found himself trapped behind a group of students who exited with painful slowness.</p>\n<p>In the end, Minsoo caught him halfway down the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminie,\u201d he said, and Jimin shuddered.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t realize he was backing away until he hit the wall behind him. Minsoo stood in front of him, not too close but close enough that it made him tremble.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Minsoo asked, as if he had the right to ask that question.</p>\n<p>Something about the way he looked at him, a hint of the tenderness that used to make Jimin weak, had panic settling in his heart. \u201cGo away,\u201d he said. Minsoo took a step toward him, brow furrowing in confusion. Now he was really shaking, so hard he wrapped his arms around himself to control it. \u201cGo away, go away, go away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, what the hell\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo away, go away, go away.\u201d He had his eyes squeezed shut, shrinking into himself. He wasn\u2019t sure if his brain was connected to his mouth anymore because he couldn\u2019t stop the words that flooded out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m going.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stood there for a minute before he dared to open his eyes. The hallway was empty save for a girl bent over the water fountain further down. Jimin clamped his shaking fingers around his backpack straps and ran, around the corner until he found a sitting area near the vending machines. Collapsing into one of the chairs, he pulled his knees into his chest and held tight, trying to regulate his breathing.</p>\n<p>Namjoon found him like that. He wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed, but Namjoon looked like he had just gotten out of class.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin.\u201d He made for him with worry etched into his face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin couldn\u2019t find it in him to answer. He hugged his knees even tighter. Namjoon knelt next to him and rubbed his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here.\u201d For a while they stayed like that, until Namjoon asked, \u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMinsoo,\u201d he managed to say.</p>\n<p>Namjoon\u2019s eyes narrowed immediately. He glanced around. \u201cWhat the fuck did he say to you? Where did he go?\u201d When Jimin didn\u2019t answer he stood, eyes blazing, hands clenching into fists. \u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill him\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin grabbed his wrist and pulled him back down. \u201cI just want to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>That night Namjoon spent one hour with him trying to see if they could switch his schedule around. But there was no other time he could take the course, and he needed it to graduate. He had to resign himself to a semester of facing his biggest fear every day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>now</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, you know.\u201d His little brother\u2019s words come after Jimin finally tells him everything that happened with Minsoo.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you sound like you kind of still think it\u2019s your fault. But it wasn\u2019t.\u201d They\u2019re sitting in front of their neighborhood convenience store with cups of tteokbokki. Jihyun has finished his. He pulls at a loose string hanging off his sweatshirt angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s that asshole\u2019s fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to feel better if you keep thinking it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t like being told what to do by his younger brother, but maybe Jihyun\u2019s right. So a few days later he sits down and makes a list of all the things Minsoo made him feel bad about. And then next to each one, he comes up with a reason why it\u2019s wrong. Some of the things are so ingrained he can hardly even begin to think of them differently.</p>\n<p>And it goes on like that for pages. If he\u2019s being honest, it doesn\u2019t really help that much. But it helps a little. A little is better than nothing.</p>\n<p>For a long time, he tried to push back the memories of his time with Minsoo. Now he understands that running away from what happened isn\u2019t the best option, at least not for him. All it has done is let the feelings boil until they\u2019re suffocating. So over the next months, Jimin does a lot of thinking. He thinks about what happened and how he felt and how he feels now. It hurts so bad sometimes he wants to crawl into a hole and never get up.</p>\n<p>He finds a job teaching English as a fill-in for a teacher who left halfway through the year, and it helps ground him. Forces him to wake up and confront the world every day even when he doesn\u2019t want to. He starts training at a dance studio in the city. That helps, too. He makes friends, and dancing has always helped him feel better. His dad only gets sick a few times over the next months, and he goes to work almost every day.</p>\n<p>Unlearning the cruel words of a manipulator is hard, but for the first time, Jimin really tries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>then</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jimin became enamored of Jeon Jungkook so quickly Yoongi would laugh at him.</p>\n<p>Jimin thought Jungkook was cute; not the kind of cute that erupted fluttery butterflies in his stomach, but the kind of cute that made him want to coo and pinch Jungkook\u2019s cheeks. Jungkook\u2019s bumbling attempts at flirting were painfully obvious, and for a while Jimin thought he was just doing it to be funny. There was no way he landed himself with the kind of reputation he had being <em>that</em> bad at flirting.</p>\n<p>In fact, Jimin had a lot of doubts about Jungkook\u2019s so-called reputation. The same way rumors flew about Jimin, they flittered through the mill about Jungkook, too. He had sex with a professor to pass a class. His alcohol limit was practically nonexistent. Once he got really drunk and told a police officer to suck his dick.</p>\n<p>Jimin didn\u2019t believe most of them. Yoongi assured him that there was some basis to the rumors, if Professor Choi\u2019s constant complaining was anything to go by. But it was nothing like they said. And Jimin only had to be around Jungkook for a little while to learn that he was little like the act he hid behind. Sometimes the shy, sweet side slipped through, and Jimin\u2019s heart burst with affection.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s partiality toward Jungkook grew to the point where Yoongi set up a jar in the kitchen with \u201cJimin won\u2019t shut up\u201d scrawled on it in messy permanent marker. Every time Jimin complimented Jungkook, Yoongi made him donate a 50 won coin to the jar.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not talk about him that much,\u201d Jimin insisted the first time Yoongi sat there, labeling the jar with his tongue sticking out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jungkookie\u2019s such a good artist, Jungkookie\u2019s so good with the kids, Jungkookie got an A in his seminar</em>. You\u2019re literally so annoying.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s high-pitched impersonation had Namjoon in fits.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does have a point,\u201d Namjoon added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are just jealous!\u201d Jimin yelled, but once the jar started filling up with coins he realized maybe they weren\u2019t exaggerating after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>now</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming, right?\u201d Namjoon\u2019s scratchy voice crackles through the line.</p>\n<p>Jimin holds his phone between his shoulder and ear as he juggles textbooks and keys in his hands. \u201cUm.\u201d He backs out of his classroom, fumbling to lock the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Jimin, it\u2019s graduation. You have to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, dunno.\u201d Jungkook will be there. Jimin bows to a teacher walking by.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for your damn bus ticket if I have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d He stuffs his books in a messenger bag and slings it over his shoulder. When he makes it to the door out of the school, he loosens his tie and sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Hoseok and Taehyung will ask you, too. We all want you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin rubs his face tiredly. It was a long day. Fridays always mean the kids are too antsy to listen. \u201cI\u2019ll have to see if I can get off work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ceremony\u2019s Friday evening. You\u2019ll only have to take off a day. Stay the weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll try, hyung. I gotta catch a bus so I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares at his phone, resting in the palm of his hand. Jungkook will be there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>then</em>\n</p>\n<p>Bobby and Jimin had a long history.</p>\n<p>The first year they met, they messed around, no strings attached. Bobby transferred schools at the year\u2019s end, just weeks after Jimin met Minsoo. They stayed in touch for a while, faded off during the time Minsoo and Jimin dated, until by coincidence or fate Bobby witnessed something he shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He only ever met Minsoo once. A lot of people might have seen what happened at the party and let it go, thought it was none of their business. But after Bobby saw a guy that looked an awful lot like Minsoo slip into a bedroom with someone at a party, he called Yoongi. Yoongi came to Jimin that night and very casually asked, \u201cSo where\u2019s Minsoo this weekend?\u201d Jimin told him about an education seminar at Dongguk University, and Yoongi\u2019s face fell.</p>\n<p>Jimin was mad at Bobby. He was mad at Yoongi. Stupidly, he tried to defend Minsoo, tried to blame himself. To say Yoongi <em>was kind of mean about it</em> was maybe an understatement; he was harsh enough that Jimin didn\u2019t talk to him for three months after that. Three months it took him to get his life back together and understand that Yoongi and Bobby had only been trying to help.</p>\n<p>The summer before his last year, he and Bobby met up a few times and spoke more frequently. When he visited for a few weeks during the semester, Jimin couldn\u2019t help but fall. Bobby was so good to him, so much better than he deserved. He didn\u2019t fall as hard as he could have but he did fall, and he knew Bobby did, too. But Jimin couldn\u2019t imagine being with anyone even after all that time. The memory of being with Minsoo haunted him. Bobby confessed and he said no and that was that, even though it hurt.</p>\n<p>After Bobby left, Jungkook\u2019s presence in his life suddenly increased. The flirty jokes disappeared entirely and left a kind, flustered Jungkook in their stead. Whenever Jimin felt tired or stressed, Jungkook was there cheering him up or bringing him food, pretending like it was nothing and blushing when Jimin teased him. The real Jungkook, the one hidden underneath all that bravado, started to shine through.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t realize how much he liked Jungkook until it was too late to pull away. He figured it out in bursts. Suspected it when he stared at Jungkook\u2019s lips for too long one day, or when he curled up with him on the dance studio floor and didn\u2019t want to let go. But it didn\u2019t click until the night at the river, when Jungkook said <em>because he wasn\u2019t anything like me</em> and Jimin\u2019s heart just <em>ached</em>. It wasn\u2019t the normal kind of ache; it was the kind of ache where he would do anything to drive away Jungkook\u2019s pain, to show him that he was beautiful and talented and perfect just the way he is.</p>\n<p>And once he realized it, it flooded over him in relentless waves. Yet even though he liked Jungkook so much it hurt, he still couldn\u2019t do it. He still couldn\u2019t shake Minsoo. There were only two weeks left and then he would be gone and he figured it was best to just let it go. He would leave and nurse the feelings quietly and hope they faded with distance. He thought, a small part of him, that Jungkook liked him back. If the way he reacted when he found out Jimin was leaving meant anything, then he did.</p>\n<p>But it didn\u2019t matter. He doubted Jungkook would confess regardless. Jungkook hid from him for a week and the distance stung even more than liking him stung, and Jimin started to fear the upcoming parting. He didn\u2019t want to let Jungkook go. He didn\u2019t ever want to let him go.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t expect Jungkook to confess, an hour before he left.</p>\n<p>He cried all the way to Busan.</p>\n<p>Somewhere between the two cities, looking out the window through blurry eyes, Jimin thought, <em>I hate myself</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>now</em>\n</p>\n<p>No matter what he does, he can\u2019t let go of Jeon Jungkook.</p>\n<p>He hears his voice in his head, telling him a bad pickup line or a stupid joke that makes him laugh anyway. He\u2019s sitting on Jimin\u2019s bed, kicking his feet back and forth and asking matter-of-factly how many assignments he can skip and still pass because he\u2019d really rather play Piano Tiles than do his homework. He\u2019s riding down the street on his moped and insisting that Stark is <em>water</em> blue, not <em>baby</em> blue.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in the corner of Jimin\u2019s eye before he turns, he\u2019s in the air he breathes, the beat of his heart, imprinted on the back of his eyelids when he closes them. He\u2019s everywhere, a shadow slipping through Jimin\u2019s fingertips. Always out of reach.</p>\n<p>He dreams about him. Little ones, where they\u2019re sprawled out on the couch watching anime and Namjoon\u2019s yelling at them to shut up because he has class in the morning. And big ones, with Jungkook\u2019s lips against his throat and his hands hot on Jimin\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s too early to tell, but sometimes Jimin thinks he\u2019s never liked anyone quite as much as he likes Jeon Jungkook.</p>\n<p>Jeon Jungkook and Kim Taehyung are very, very late.</p>\n<p>Granted, they\u2019re kind of used to being late. Jungkook generally finds it rather difficult to make it to morning classes on time, and Taehyung running out the door with his shoes half-laced is a regular occurrence in their apartment. Taehyung was late to his own birthday party once.</p>\n<p>But in this particular case, they absolutely <em>cannot</em> be late.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d Taehyung shouts, straightening his robe as he runs for the door.</p>\n<p>Jungkook hops after him on one foot, tugging a loafer onto the other. Halfway there he catches sight of Taehyung\u2019s graduation cap sitting on the counter. Tapping his toe against the floor to make sure the shoe is snug, he grabs the hat and catches up. \u201cDon\u2019t forget this, you idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, my parents are going to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They beeline for the stairs, taking them two at a time. Jungkook gets close enough to jam the cap onto Taehyung\u2019s head. They make it there with seconds to spare. It\u2019s the first graduation of the day; the university separates them by department. Taehyung\u2019s is early morning, Namjoon\u2019s is after lunch, and Hoseok\u2019s comes just before dinner.</p>\n<p>Jungkook finds Taehyung\u2019s family in the audience and sits with them after they shower him with hugs and kisses. He cranes his head to look for the others but can\u2019t find them amid the crowd. Their education department is rather large. He satisfies himself with taking unnecessarily zoomed-in photos of Taehyung standing in line to shake hands with the department head. Just before Taehyung\u2019s turn, Jungkook snaps an extra embarrassing one of him looking across the audience with his mouth open. He sends it to the group chat immediately.</p>\n<p>\n<em>jeon where are u sitting</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>meet us in the back after</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>come to the corner look for joons big head </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>hey that\u2019s mean :(</em>\n</p>\n<p>As soon as the last student shakes hands, everyone stands up to mill around. Jungkook slips away to find them, heading for the back corner away from the door. Namjoon\u2019s blond hair really does lead him in the right direction. He\u2019s almost there, ducking around a group of girls, when he realizes there\u2019s someone else standing next to them.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d known it was a possibility. How could he have not, with how much the others kept mentioning him? But up until the last moment, no one had known if he would make it or not\u2014or maybe they had known and kept it from Jungkook. Even so, he\u2019s not prepared. He halts in his tracks like he\u2019s hit a wall.</p>\n<p>Jimin has dyed his hair black again. He looks good. Thinner, but he\u2019s smiling, glowing. Or maybe it\u2019s just that Jungkook has restricted his image to memories for so long that seeing him in person reminds him of how beautiful Jimin really is. His mind hasn\u2019t done him justice. Jimin is dressed up like the rest of them, black pants and a light dress shirt. His eyes soften when they land on Jungkook, and the smile he sends is hesitant. Jimin raises a hand\u2014a small, pretty hand\u2014and waves.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They crash at Hoseok\u2019s place that night, all six of them.</p>\n<p>Their last night together is not as sad as it was when Jimin left. Jungkook is more at peace with himself now than he was then; he\u2019s not as terrified of spending two years without his old friends. He\u2019ll miss them, but he knows it won\u2019t be forever. Anyway, at least he still has Yoongi.</p>\n<p>Aside from a few cursory words and the occasional response, Jimin and Jungkook don\u2019t talk to each other much. They sit on opposite sides of the room. Jungkook has a perfect view of him, catches himself looking even when he doesn\u2019t mean to. Sometimes he thinks Jimin\u2019s looking at him, too, but neither of them acknowledge it. The others don\u2019t try to push them together, though Jungkook sees the way they look between them.</p>\n<p>Six months shouldn\u2019t make a difference but somehow Jimin looks older. Jungkook knew it already but now it\u2019s reaffirmed; six months of zero contact haven\u2019t lessened his feelings for Jimin at all. If anything, they flood him with even more power than before, every time he throws a glance his way.</p>\n<p>Namjoon passes out on the couch, Jimin and Hoseok share his bed, and the rest of them take the living room floor in a pile of spare blankets when they grow too tired to stay awake any longer. Yoongi complains about the hardness of the floor, but he still falls asleep first. Before long Namjoon\u2019s snores join him, and Taehyung\u2019s soft breaths, too.</p>\n<p>Jungkook can\u2019t sleep. He thinks about Jimin, just a wall separating them, about his face soft in sleep the way it was the night of the party. He\u2019s been waiting to see him again for every minute of every day but now that he\u2019s here Jungkook doesn\u2019t know what to do. Because the reality hasn\u2019t changed. Jimin still turned him down.</p>\n<p>He stares at the ceiling for what feels like hours, hyperaware of every sound and movement around him. At some point Taehyung shifts and mumbles something about \u201cdog, cute dog\u201d and Namjoon snores so loud the others can probably hear it from the bedroom. It may not be as bad as when Jimin left, but he\u2019s still sad. He\u2019s not going to lose them but it won\u2019t ever be like this again. In a way, change is always a little sad.</p>\n<p>Hoseok\u2019s bedroom door creaks, soft footsteps sounding as someone emerges and quietly closes it again. Jungkook closes his eyes and holds still. A soft whoosh of air brushes his cheek as whoever it is passes him. He hears the telltale sign of someone pulling on shoes. Cracking one eye open, he catches Jimin bent over by the door as he laces his boots.</p>\n<p>Jimin glances behind him and Jungkook squeezes his eyes shut quickly. The door opens then closes just as softly. Jungkook waits for a span of three breaths, debating, then jumps up to follow. He kicks on his shoes as he walks out, peeking down the hall to see Jimin heading for the stairs. Jimin enters the stairwell; Jungkook waits until the door closes behind him to follow. He opens the door carefully and sees the sole of Jimin\u2019s shoe disappear around the bend as he ascends. A voice in his head that sounds an awful lot like Hoseok\u2019s says <em>stop being a creep, Jeon Jungkook</em>, but he ignores it.</p>\n<p>He stands in the doorway and waits to hear where Jimin stops. The sound of another door opening doesn\u2019t come until much later, and it\u2019s the sharp scraping of a particularly heavy one. He must have gone to the roof.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has been to the roof of Hoseok\u2019s apartment building many times. A few spare chairs and tables dot the center, mostly bent and wobbly, and the sides are blocked off by short ledges that border the building\u2019s air conditioners and wiring. Jimin stands on one of those sides with his forearms leaning against the ledge, the wind ruffling his hair. He\u2019s looking down.</p>\n<p>Jungkook moves to the short ledge and says, \u201cHyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin glances back, eyes wide. He bites his lip but doesn\u2019t look away. \u201cJungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a quick hop, Jungkook scales the ledge and maneuvers through the machines and wiring. He joins Jimin at the ledge, keeping a careful foot between them. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Jimin turns back to look out over the city. Hoseok\u2019s building is a little ways off campus, but the tall classroom buildings are still visible from here. There are so many lights it\u2019s hard to see the stars. The occasional car or moped revs past.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stand quietly for a while. Jungkook fidgets, moving his hands from his pockets to the ledge to his pockets again. He can\u2019t think of anything to say. He wants to ask how Jimin\u2019s doing but he doesn\u2019t want to come off as presumptuous. He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s imagining the heat from Jimin\u2019s body or if they really are standing close enough for him to feel it. Running a hand through his hair, he rocks back on his heels.</p>\n<p>In the end they both speak at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard you got a job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got your text.\u201d</p>\n<p>They glance at each other, eyes meeting briefly, then away. Jungkook flushes. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you,\u201d Jimin mumbles. Jungkook peeks to the side and sees that his cheeks are pink, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cNamjoon hyung said you got a teaching job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of tough. The kids don\u2019t really like me yet because I came in the middle of the year, but it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin hesitates. Jungkook clears his throat awkwardly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, you were saying something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods, so quickly his bangs fall into his eyes. Jungkook\u2019s having trouble getting used to him without orange hair, but he likes it. \u201cI got your text. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t answer. But I was\u2014am\u2014really happy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It had been a shock, seeing his old crush that day. Jungkook had left campus to get lunch with Seokjin when he saw him sitting three tables away. He watched him for a long while, waiting. But he didn\u2019t feel anything. No anger, no loathing, not even a hint of past attraction. He thought of the way he had laughed at Jungkook\u2019s stammering confession, but the memory didn\u2019t make his stomach swirl with regret like it once did.</p>\n<p>Instead he thought about Jimin, and how he spent an entire semester in class with a man who hurt him so bad he still cried about it. How it must have made him sick to see him across the room, laughing like he hadn\u2019t done anything while Jimin couldn\u2019t even let himself be happy because of him.</p>\n<p>But his old crush didn\u2019t hurt Jungkook anymore. It took a year and a half, but he had finally moved on. Maybe they were right when they said wounds healed with time; even if they didn\u2019t go away, they did fade. It gave him hope. Because if he was all right, maybe one day Jimin would be, too.</p>\n<p>So on a whim he had texted him without letting himself pause to think about it. He hadn\u2019t expected Jimin to answer, but it still hurt when he didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt, um. It made me cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Jimin smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. It wasn\u2019t a bad cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t really know what that means, but Jimin\u2019s smiling. Maybe it was always a trend, but today it seems like every time Jimin smiles, he loses his train of thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re rooming with Yoongi hyung next year?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I mean, it made sense. We both needed roommates, and neither of us really wanted to find strangers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys will be good together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over the past semester he discovered that he and Yoongi have much more in common than either of them expected. After Jimin left, their ragtag group of friends had grown even more close-knit, and in the process Jungkook learned an awful lot about Yoongi.</p>\n<p>He learned that even though Yoongi was rather hostile during their first weeks of meeting each other, he didn\u2019t actually think Jungkook was all that bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I really thought you were going to hurt Jimin do you think I would have let you into my goddamn house?\u201d</p>\n<p>He learned that Yoongi drinks beer like other people drink water, and photography is the most important thing in the world for him, but not as important as the people he chooses to care about. Somehow Jungkook managed to become one of those people, and Yoongi started treating him like a wayward little brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook,\u201d he said once when he got really drunk, slinging his arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot to learn in life. Follow me and I\u2019ll help you figure it out, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>(Namjoon had chimed in to say that if he followed in Yoongi\u2019s path he would turn into a bitter old man who slept like a cat.)</p>\n<p>The most vital piece of information he learned about Min Yoongi, however, was that he used to struggle like Jungkook did.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese assholes, they\u2019d follow me around in a pack after school because I was small and skinny and I kind of sucked at defending myself. I could think of a snarky comeback in about two seconds, but throw punches? Nah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get over it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that. There\u2019s not really any answer for that. But I just had to stop letting them control me, you know? Even when they weren\u2019t around. I had to learn to do things my way, not the way my memories of them dictated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook thinks of those words a lot when things get hard.</p>\n<p>When the middle of the semester neared and students began to sign leases for the upcoming years\u2019 housing, Yoongi asked Jungkook if he wanted to live with him. And in all honesty, the next two years without Taehyung and Hoseok and Namjoon didn\u2019t seem as frightening after that.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook says, turning to Jimin. \u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hold each other\u2019s gazes until Jimin flushes and looks down, his lashes casting shadows against his cheeks. \u201cSo how\u2019s Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cStark\u2019s done for. He died a week into the semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even have him for two years. As a mechanic, I\u2019m offended.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even a real mechanic. Anyway, he was already three years old when I bought him.\u201d Jimin shoots him a look. \u201cOkay, maybe I didn\u2019t take as good care of him as I should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get a bicycle like Taehyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a job, actually. My dad said if I pitched in half the money he\u2019d pool the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImpressive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of old and shitty and he doesn\u2019t really start all the time, but. He works. I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you name him, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook rubs the back of his head, sniffing. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook, I can\u2019t believe you. What\u2019d you name him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be fucking kidding me.\u201d Jimin\u2019s laughing, falling against the ledge. He\u2019s so beautiful Jungkook forgets to breathe. When his laughter dies off he rests his cheeks on his forearms from where they lean on the ledge, facing Jungkook. His cheek and lips puff out cutely. The silence is more comfortable this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow have you been, hyung?\u201d Jungkook finally asks. He knows Jimin will understand that his words hold more weight than a simple <em>how are you</em>.</p>\n<p>Jimin closes his eyes and sighs. \u201cI miss you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all miss you, too.\u201d He lets himself take one small step closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m trying to adjust.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rooftop lights make Jimin\u2019s skin glow. His cheeks look so soft. Jungkook doesn\u2019t notice that he\u2019s taken another step toward him, and now they\u2019re so close they\u2019re almost touching. He raises a hand, reaching for Jimin\u2019s face, then stops. Jimin\u2019s eyes flicker open. He stares at him, and he doesn\u2019t pull away. So Jungkook runs his fingers along Jimin\u2019s cheekbone with a feather-light touch. His skin is even softer than it looks. He cups Jimin\u2019s face in his hand and strokes his cheek with his thumb, the light touch turning surer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d Jungkook whispers.</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks slowly. Then he turns his head and kisses Jungkook\u2019s palm. His lips are light and barely there, his hot breath more prominent against Jungkook\u2019s skin than the kiss itself. Goosebumps erupt on Jungkook\u2019s skin, a shiver running down his spine. He stares at Jimin\u2019s full lips, imagines the light, teasing touch on places other than his hand.</p>\n<p>The rooftop door scrapes open. He jumps away so fast he almost trips, catching himself by bracing a hand against the ledge. Jimin laughs, a quiet chuckle that he stifles behind his hand as he straightens. A man steps onto the roof and lights up a cigarette.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go to sleep,\u201d Jimin says. He steps over the wires without waiting to see if Jungkook will follow.</p>\n<p>But at this point he must know that Jungkook will always follow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two months into the semester without Jimin, Namjoon had revealed a marvelously important fact.</p>\n<p>They were studying in Dream Bean, whose Americanos Jungkook never appreciated quite as much when Jimin wasn\u2019t there to make them. Namjoon had cleared his throat and asked in a pitiful attempt at sounding casual, \u201cHave you, uh, heard from Jimin lately?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook didn\u2019t glance up from his sketchbook, but his fingers tightened around his pencil. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Namjoon pretended to leaf through his textbook, but Jungkook knew he wasn\u2019t really reading. He rolled his eyes and waited for Namjoon to spill. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe found a job teaching in an elementary school. And he joined a dance studio.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you should, uh, try texting him or something. To say hi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon had sighed and let go of his book, abandoning the pretense. \u201cHe really liked you, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook had fumbled his pencil. \u201cHe did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA hell of a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes had widened. He tried to say something but the words didn\u2019t come out. So he shrugged helplessly. Part of him had suspected it, from Jimin\u2019s blushes and teasing, and from his last words. <em>It doesn\u2019t matter how much I like you</em>. But in the end Jungkook had never really known how Jimin felt, or how he might have answered if his fear hadn\u2019t stopped him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\u2014I had no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you know he doesn\u2019t date, so no matter what he wasn\u2019t going to say anything to you.\u201d Namjoon smiled softly, his dimples clear. \u201cYoongi told him maybe he should distance himself from you, to make things easier. But he couldn\u2019t do that. Because that\u2019s the kind of person Jimin is. If he likes you, he wants you around even when it hurts him.\u201d</p>\n<p>A lump rose in his throat. To know, to really know, that Jimin had felt something for him\u2014somehow it hurt even more.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem. But that\u2019s why you should talk to him, Jungkook. Because there\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he\u2019d tried, a few weeks later when he texted him about meeting his old crush, but Jimin hadn\u2019t answered. So Jungkook had thought maybe Namjoon was wrong. Even if Jimin liked him, maybe he had decided that distance really was the best.</p>\n<p>So when Jimin books a bus ticket back to Busan for Saturday night, Jungkook doesn\u2019t ask him to stay.</p>\n<p>He wishes he could reiterate his feelings for him. But the last time he confessed, he upset Jimin right before he left, and he regrets that. So this time he vows not to say anything. If anyone\u2019s going to confess, it has to be Jimin. Jungkook knows how much it stresses Jimin out to have someone confess to him when he\u2019s only going to turn them down; he has to be comfortable enough to do it himself.</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t really think he\u2019s going to. Kissing his hand is not an indicator that Jimin has changed his mind. But he does think that maybe if he stays quiet, Jimin will at least call him once in a while. That\u2019s not enough, but it\u2019s better than nothing. The thought of another six months without hearing Jimin\u2019s voice makes his stomach churn.</p>\n<p>Taehyung and Namjoon leave with their families in the morning, and Hoseok packs his things for Sunday. Close to evening, when Yoongi and Jungkook are helping Hoseok scour his apartment for any last minute possessions, Jimin enters holding what looks like his bus ticket.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it?\u201d Yoongi calls from where he crouches by the kitchen cabinets.</p>\n<p>Jimin opens his mouth to answer, and then he freezes. He stands there in the doorway, mouth open, eyes wide, glancing between the three of them. It takes him so long to move that they all stop what they\u2019re doing to look. Then he says, very decidedly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hides the ticket behind his back.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all looking at him in amazement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Yoongi begins, but Jimin cuts him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re all out of tickets to Busan. Uh, totally out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s literally no way\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, can you drive me?\u201d he blurts.</p>\n<p>Yoongi and Hoseok both spin to look at Jungkook, who has paused in the middle of tying up Hoseok\u2019s trash bag. \u201cHuh?\u201d Jungkook gapes back at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me.\u201d Hoseok throws his hands up in defeat. \u201cYou both are literally impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just spent, what, forty thousand goddamn won just to come back and say you didn\u2019t get a goddamn ticket. Why didn\u2019t you just ask him in the first place\u2014\u201d Yoongi slams the cabinet closed in frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t spend forty thousand won, they didn\u2019t have any tickets!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBuses to Busan run every half an hour, Park Jimin, you lying piece of shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a four hour drive to Busan, roughly. Gas is expensive. Jungkook\u2019s not even sure his car can handle a drive that long. If his parents find out he went to Busan unannounced and didn\u2019t stop to visit his grandparents, they\u2019ll kill him. Logically speaking, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to drive Jimin all the way there just to come back. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>They all spin to look at him again. \u201cHuh?\u201d Jimin looks like he really didn\u2019t think Jungkook would agree.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you,\u201d he says easily. He knots the trash bag and makes for the door. \u201cWhen do you wanna leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>From behind him, he hears Hoseok and Yoongi\u2019s exasperated exclamations.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are fucking idiots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t come back with good news then I\u2019m disowning both of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t listen. He\u2019s looking at Jimin, who\u2019s looking back with a wary smile. \u201cWe have to talk, Jungkookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>The excited voice comes as they walk across campus later that evening, Jungkook trailing just a step behind Jimin, still reeling from the sudden decision. It\u2019s Hyejin across the sidewalk, still dressed in her graduation cap and gown. She waves, a massive smile on her face, and speed-walks toward him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins back. \u201cNoona!\u201d</p>\n<p>He meets her halfway, and she pulls him into a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations on making it out of hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic,\u201d she scoffs, and hits him on the head with her diploma. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be here to yell at you anymore, so stay out of trouble, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo promises. Good luck in the real world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, whatever. See you around, Jeon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood knowing you, Ahn.\u201d</p>\n<p>She walks away with another wave. Jimin comes to a stop next to Jungkook, his bag hiked up on one shoulder. \u201cYou guys have come a long way from glares and passive-aggressive greetings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were kind of just doing it to do it after a while, you know? She\u2019s actually pretty cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>They head to the edge of campus, where Jungkook tells Jimin to wait so he can fetch the car. Tony has chipped forest green paint and manual locks and windows. Two of the four windows don\u2019t roll down, and the passenger seat doesn\u2019t have a sun visor. One of the backseat doors doesn\u2019t open, not even a little. It takes five minutes of whispered compliments for the engine to start before he pulls up to the curb in front of Jimin. Just for old time\u2019s sake, he leans out of the window and jerks his head as the universal <em>get in, baby</em>. He\u2019s half-afraid Jimin won\u2019t laugh, but he does. He always does.</p>\n<p>He can still remember the jealousy that stirred in him the day Jimin arrived at the daycare on the back of Bobby\u2019s motorcycle. How he had loathed Stark, who could hold a driver and no one else. How he\u2019d wanted to boast that he could take Jimin places if he wanted, how inadequate he felt that he couldn\u2019t. Now he\u2019s picking Jimin up in his car and he\u2019s realized it doesn\u2019t really matter all that much, after all.</p>\n<p>Jimin tries to open the door that doesn\u2019t work to put his bag in the back.</p>\n<p>\u201cOther side,\u201d Jungkook says wearily.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice car you got here, Jungkookie.\u201d Jimin slips into the passenger seat with a cheeky smile. \u201cAs a mechanic, I can tell you with extreme confidence that it\u2019s not going to last very long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t insult Tony. He\u2019s sensitive.\u201d Jungkook rubs the steering wheel comfortingly. \u201cYou\u2019re not even a mechanic.\u201d</p>\n<p>As they pull out of campus and into the city, Jimin fiddles with the radio, which only sometimes works. Jungkook tries to focus on driving and not on what Jimin might say to him after so long. Or on what he should say to Jimin. It feels surreal having him here, a few feet away, like he never went away at all. During the time they spent apart, Jungkook thought a lot about the bet. How it was a pretty shitty decision on his part that led him to Jimin in the first place, and how wrong it was to use Jimin like that. But at the same time, if it weren\u2019t for that stupid bet, they never would have gotten close. And while maybe life would have been easier if he hadn\u2019t met Jimin and had his heart broken, Jungkook doesn\u2019t regret it. Even if at the end of this car ride Jimin turns around and never speaks to him again, he still wouldn\u2019t change a thing.</p>\n<p>But he wants to tell him. He owes it to him, at least, to be honest.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s working up the nerve to say something when Jimin settles on a radio station and says, \u201cHoseok hyung mentioned that you don\u2019t really party much anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI kind of figured out that I was using partying and sex as a way to run away from myself. Once I figured that out, I tried to stop. So I could find out who I really was under all that hiding.\u201d It\u2019s hard to say it out loud, even now. He\u2019s ruminated on these thoughts for months, but he doesn\u2019t like talking about his feelings. Years of societal conditioning lead him to believe doing so makes him weak, and overcoming that is easier said than done. He tries to keep his voice steady, but the way Jimin glances at him tells him he doesn\u2019t succeed. \u201cI never really liked it much, anyway, all of that. I don\u2019t really like being around crowds or people I\u2019m not comfortable with. I was just forcing myself because I thought I had to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too. I mean, it\u2019s not like the partying or the sex were inherently the problem. Taehyung hyung got laid twice last weekend. Hoseok hyung went to, like, three ragers after finals last semester. They\u2019re fine. They love it. It was just me that was the problem, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like Hoseok hyung always says.\u201d Jimin throws out his arms and does a terrible impersonation of Hoseok. \u201cIt\u2019s the feel of it, guys, the atmosphere! None of you assholes understand!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never got the feel of it. You were doing it for the wrong reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to get the feel of it.\u201d Jimin sighs, leaning his cheek against the window. Jungkook slows down extra before going over a bump in the road so it doesn\u2019t jostle him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou miss it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never would have stopped if I didn\u2019t have to. But I guess we can\u2019t have fun forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>They fall into a weighty silence. Jungkook thinks about growing up and a future that doesn\u2019t involve his friends and feels a little of the old despondency. Jimin\u2019s already there. He wonders if it\u2019s lonely.</p>\n<p>But then again, growing up doesn\u2019t have to mean leaving everyone behind. It just means putting more effort into staying together.</p>\n<p>As he pulls onto the expressway, Jungkook says, \u201cI kept on volunteering at the daycare.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd tutoring Chan. I\u2019m an art major with an education track, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns to him in surprise. \u201cEducation? You want to be a teacher?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI realized I love art the most when I\u2019m helping Chan. And Seokjin hyung, my studio professor from last semester, he really changed the way I view art. And life, too, really. It\u2019d be really cool to have that kind of effect on someone one day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou finally figured it out.\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes crinkle with genuine happiness.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel a lot better about myself. I actually want to work hard because I know where I\u2019m going, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so lost anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods, pride flaring in his chest. It\u2019s nice to have Jimin look at him so fondly. And it\u2019s nice to feel confident after spending so long conflicted about what he wanted out of life. He still doesn\u2019t know, not entirely, because no one ever knows exactly what they want. But he\u2019s on the right track, at least.</p>\n<p>They drive for a while on the busy expressway before Jungkook summons up the courage. He clears his throat. His fingers tremble a little on the steering wheel. \u201cHyung. I have to tell you something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns toward him, waiting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might\u2014\u201d he falters, licks his lips. Gathers strength, eyes fixed resolutely on the road ahead of him. \u201cYou might hate me for this. And if you do, I understand. I deserve it. But I have to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first time I saw you, it was in the dining hall. You didn\u2019t know I was there. You were a few tables away, reading this massive English book.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s creepy, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles a little. \u201cAnd then this girl came up to you and asked you to coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels rather than sees Jimin shift.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said no, and you put your head down and looked so sad. I couldn\u2019t figure out why you\u2019d be so sad over turning someone down.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s hands tighten around the wheel. \u201cHonestly, the first time I saw you all I could think was that you were the most beautiful boy on campus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin makes a small noise, of discomfort or amusement or what, Jungkook doesn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few days later, you came to talk to Taehyung hyung when I was with him. So I asked him to set me up. He said you didn\u2019t date. I didn\u2019t want to date you. He said you didn\u2019t fuck around, either. And he was so adamant on it. I saw you again at the auto shop and fuck, you were gorgeous and I couldn\u2019t accept that I didn\u2019t have a chance. So Taehyung and I made a bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t say anything, doesn\u2019t even move. Jungkook\u2019s too terrified to look at him, so he looks forward, chewing on his lip, trying to control his shaking fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said I couldn\u2019t get you to sleep with me by the end of the semester. I said I could. If he won, I\u2019d have to do his laundry for a whole semester. If I won, I got to use his Xbox whenever I wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs. It\u2019s not an amused laugh, rather a harsh one, and Jungkook\u2019s stomach constricts painfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I kept trying to hit on you and find you everywhere. It\u2019s the shittiest thing I\u2019ve ever done, hyung, I know that. I called it off in the middle of the semester.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice is stiff. \u201cI want to know exactly how long you kept it going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few weeks after Bobby left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo when you started volunteering at the daycare. That was because you were trying to get in my pants?\u201d</p>\n<p>He swallows past the lump in his throat. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when I told you everything. When I told you how people started to see me like a conquest. Even then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you got me chicken. All those times we studied together. The whole time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you could use Taehyung\u2019s Xbox.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucked up, Jungkook. That\u2019s really fucked up.\u201d He says it hard and unyielding, and he\u2019s right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I know, it\u2019s awful. I\u2019m awful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that? Even after I told you, didn\u2019t you feel bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt bad all the time. I felt so\u2014I felt so damn guilty all the time, sometimes it made me sick. That doesn\u2019t change anything. But I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The car rounds a bend in the expressway only to run into a jam; all the cars skid to a stop behind the stalled traffic. Jungkook brakes, throwing his arm out in front of Jimin to keep him from jerking forward. When the car stills, Jungkook finally looks at him. He\u2019s staring down at Jungkook\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He puts his hands back on the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019m only explaining, not excusing myself, okay? It doesn\u2019t make it any better. But when I was in high school I used to get beat up a lot for being kind of quiet and passive. I couldn\u2019t stand up for myself. It was\u2014it was pretty bad. And you know how things went with the guy I liked. When I got to university, it was a fresh start. I wanted to be someone different.\u201d</p>\n<p>The traffic starts to move, inching along at a snail\u2019s pace.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be anything like the boy who couldn\u2019t talk in class and had everyone throw around insults about him. I wanted to be confident. Someone who wouldn\u2019t get rejected like I did. The bet just turned into something I could do to prove I really wasn\u2019t that boy anymore. At first it might have been, but after a while it wasn\u2019t even about you, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop the car.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances at him sharply. Jimin\u2019s looking out the window. \u201cHyung\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop the car.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waits until he can merge over the right. It takes a while in the traffic jam, but he pulls over onto the shoulder and drops his hands in his lap. Jimin yanks the door open and steps out. Jungkook\u2019s hands are shaking so bad he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them. Jimin must hate him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Jimin says through the open door.</p>\n<p>Jungkook slips out of the car and walks around to Jimin. He stands in front of him, thrumming with nervous energy. The drivers of nearby cars stalled in the jam stare at them.</p>\n<p>Jimin socks him in the stomach so hard a whoosh of breath leaves him as a pained exhale.</p>\n<p>He brushes off his knuckles and slips back into the car. Jungkook stands there, hand on his stomach, reeling. He doesn\u2019t move until Jimin leans out and says, \u201cAre we leaving or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>So he gets back into the driver\u2019s side and starts the car, stomach aching with every movement. \u201cAre you\u2014you still want to go with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta get home, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. His face is hot with shame. He deserves it, after all. When he finds space, he merges back into the traffic jam. They sit there in silence, miles of stalled traffic ahead of them. Jungkook wonders if Jimin will ever talk to him again.</p>\n<p>Then Jimin sighs. \u201cJungkook, look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to. He\u2019s burning with regret.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s soft hand presses into his cheek, turning his head to face him. He doesn\u2019t look angry. He looks tender, and maybe a little sad. It\u2019s in the curve of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jungkook says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, and I accept it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He dares to breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you did was shitty. And you\u2019re right\u2014you explained it but you can\u2019t excuse it. It\u2019s still shitty. But if the way you acted after that is any indication, I know you\u2019ve learned from it. You did a bad thing but you\u2019re not a bad person.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at Jimin in disbelief. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it if I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, yeah, I\u2019m kind of pissed. But it doesn\u2019t change how I feel about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s realizes his mouth is hanging open. He snaps it shut. \u201cHow you feel about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stares back, a flush rising on his cheeks. He turns away and crosses his arms, sitting back with a huff. \u201cDon\u2019t you know by now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard you say it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep dreaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks back at the road, and now he\u2019s smiling, giddy. He hasn\u2019t lost Jimin. He doesn\u2019t hate him. The truth hasn\u2019t changed anything except how unburdened he feels. Traffic inches forward two feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Jungkook says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told my story about figuring myself out. What about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I figured myself out?\u201d Jimin scoffs, returns to looking out the window. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen so fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. But you didn\u2019t really answer me when I asked how you were doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cars move another two feet and Jimin fiddles with the hem of his shirt. \u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stretches up in his seat to try and see beyond the rows of traffic. There must be some kind of accident ahead.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m trying. So I guess that\u2019s what matters, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin switches the radio station again, flipping through three without pausing on any for more than a second. He\u2019s biting his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you change your mind about the bus ticket? You bought it and then said you didn\u2019t.\u201d When Jimin\u2019s brow furrows like he\u2019s going to deny it, Jungkook adds, \u201cCome on, you were literally holding it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter seeing you it was\u2014it was hard to imagine leaving again. But I was going to. And then I got the ticket and came back and saw you and realized I couldn\u2019t do it a second time. So I, uh, panicked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Jungkook says fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say goodbye again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d The unspoken truth hangs between them: it doesn\u2019t matter if it has been delayed by four hours. Goodbye is still inevitable.</p>\n<p>They move along with traffic at a snail\u2019s pace for the next two hours. In that time they should be halfway to Busan; instead they\u2019ve covered the distance they might have in just one hour. Jungkook\u2019s not even sure how much longer Tony can last through the constant stopping and starting. The radio talks of a large accident that\u2019s caused the expressway to be backed up for miles, worst of all right outside Seoul. It might take them double the amount of time to make it to Busan if this persists.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be stuck here forever,\u201d Jimin groans, slumping in the seat. He\u2019s taken off his shoes and pulled his feet up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s getting late.\u201d It had already been dark out when they left. At this rate they\u2019re going to make it to Busan well after midnight.</p>\n<p>Jungkook toys with an idea and wonders how to put it to Jimin without sounding sleazy. He\u2019s not doing it to be sleazy. He wants to delay the inevitable again, perhaps, like Jimin tried with the bus ticket. And anyway they have a pretty reasonable excuse. Of course, there\u2019s always the chance that the traffic will clear up not much further down the expressway, and they\u2019ll make it to Busan with only an hour or two of delay. But then again, there\u2019s also the teensy tiny chance that it might take much longer than that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, probably gonna take ages to get to Busan,\u201d Jungkook says, rubbing his nose nonchalantly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s, like, nighttime already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks at him. The way his eyes narrow tell him he might have caught on. \u201cAnd who knows how much more of this Tony can take.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. What if it\u2019s blocked all the way to Busan?\u201d he says, even though the radio was very clear that it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Jimin nods very seriously. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to drive all night, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be so tired.\u201d Jungkook bites the inside of his cheek to keep the laughter from slipping out. \u201cI guess we should, uh, stay somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably the smartest decision. Honestly, we don\u2019t really even have a choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t help it. Jungkook snorts. Then Jimin splutters, and they\u2019re both laughing, the all-out can\u2019t-breathe kind of laughter. Jimin shifts to lean on him as he laughs. Jungkook can feel it all the way to his bones.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s not mad\u2014not unforgivably mad, anyway. He\u2019s not mad and he\u2019s here and they\u2019re going to have one more night together. Goodbye is just a little bit further away.</p>\n<p>He pulls onto the nearest exit as soon as they reach it, following signs to a small motel near a bus stop. It\u2019s lit with bright neon lights and various gaudy signs. When they park and head toward it, Jimin starts laughing all over again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst the ticket, now this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we ever be honest?\u201d</p>\n<p>The lobby is nice and cozy and not nearly as sleazy as the motel\u2019s exterior suggested. \u201cI\u2019m paying,\u201d Jimin says immediately, shoving Jungkook out of the way so he can duck toward the window behind which the hotel manager sits. \u201cA room for tonight, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He passes money under the window. The hotel manager, an older man who looks like he\u2019d much rather be asleep, glances at Jimin then back at Jungkook. His lip curls. He slides them the room key without saying anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he supposed to show us the room first?\u201d Jimin mutters as they head for the elevators.</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think he likes us.\u201d Besides Jimin\u2019s messenger bag, nothing about them suggests they are prepared to spend the night in a motel. The manager has clearly already made his assumptions. Jungkook\u2019s just glad they didn\u2019t get kicked out. If one of them were with a girl, the manager wouldn\u2019t have batted even an eyelash.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jimin looks a little despondent.</p>\n<p>Jungkook nudges him. \u201cHey, maybe if we\u2019re really annoying we\u2019ll scare off his other customers. That\u2019ll show him.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room is nice, small but comfortable, with a little yellow armchair in the corner next to a large TV and stand. The bed faces the TV, covered in floral sheets that match the yellow curtains on the small window. A painting of a scenic forest hangs above the bed, and the tables flanking it hold lamps and magazines. They\u2019ll have to share the bed unless someone wants to sleep on the floor. Jungkook doesn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t think of that before. He flushes suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta, uh, use the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>He locks the door behind him and leans on the counter, staring at his red face in the mirror. He\u2019s not a kid, he shouldn\u2019t be blushing, but it\u2019s Jimin. It\u2019s Jimin and they\u2019re going to share a bed perfectly sober and Jungkook will get to see his face when he wakes up again, cheeks and lips puffy and eyes soft. With cold water he splashes his face twice before returning to the room.</p>\n<p>Jimin has dropped his bag to the side, kicked off his shoes, and fallen back onto the bed, spread-eagled. He shifts to the side when he sees Jungkook, patting the empty space next to him. Jungkook sits down gingerly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to bite,\u201d Jimin says wryly.</p>\n<p>He flushes again, but he\u2019s not about to back down, so he gets up and steps out of his Timberlands. Then he steps out of his pants, too, because he\u2019s not going to sleep with those on. He lies down next to Jimin on top of the covers.</p>\n<p>Jimin scoffs. \u201cIs this a competition?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I don\u2019t have pajamas.\u201d Jungkook rubs his stomach, still aching from Jimin\u2019s punch. He\u2019ll probably wake up with bruises.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Jimin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tries to look sympathetic, pouting a little.</p>\n<p>Jimin smacks him on the stomach, right on the sore spot. He winces, curling up with a groan. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin slips out of bed to shift through his bag for his change of clothes from last night. Right there, with his back to Jungkook, he strips off his shirt and pants. His back muscles shift as he pulls on shorts. He\u2019s built so compact, small and strong, slender waist and narrow shoulders. Jungkook doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s been staring until Jimin\u2019s t-shirt comes on to cover every last sliver of skin, and he returns to his senses.</p>\n<p>After rolling up the blinds and turning off the lamps so only the warm streetlights and a hint of moonlight filter into the room, Jimin returns to bed. They lie side-by-side, staring at the shadows that play across the ceiling. It\u2019s quiet and warm and an almost foreign feeling creeps up on Jungkook: contentment. Even though he doesn\u2019t know where they stand or what they\u2019ll do at the end of their trip, he\u2019s content.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you figure out you liked me?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice is soft, as if he doesn\u2019t want to disturb the peace.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat night we went to the river and you told me you were leaving in two weeks.\u201d He remembers it too clearly. If he tries hard enough he can call up the exact feelings that washed over him when he finally understood exactly how much Jimin meant to him. \u201cI went home and started crying on the kitchen floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cYou liked me that much?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still do.\u201d He remembers how difficult it was the first time he said to Taehyung, <em>I like him, hyung. I like him. </em>Now it\u2019s easy. He could say it a thousand times, a million times. \u201cI still like you that much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the night I realized it, too. When you told me about that guy you liked and how he hurt you and I realized I\u2019d do anything to make you happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook holds his breath. Jimin is unmoving beside him, warm. \u201cYou were never going to say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t think you would, either, even though\u2014even though I kind of suspected how you felt. I didn\u2019t want you to say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause then you\u2019d have to say no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand how much it hurts saying no when all you want to do is say yes. I wanted to slip out of your life, let distance come between us naturally. I wanted you to forget about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could never do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted you to find someone better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs, and it sounds a little choked. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He turns onto his side, propping himself up on his elbow so he\u2019s facing Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never liked anyone as much as I like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>To hear him say it is a breath of fresh air that cradles Jungkook\u2019s skin. Relief turns him light and giddy. He\u2019s never said it outright. Until now it\u2019s been nothing more than hearsay and implication. But hearing him say it\u2014Jungkook wonders if <em>like</em> is too weak a word to describe how he feels about Jimin.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s looking at him, eyes gentle. The glow of outside light shines across his face until his eyes sparkle and his piercings glint. He reaches up and brushes his fingers along Jungkook\u2019s cheek. Jungkook leans toward him, cupping his face in his hand. He stops when there\u2019s just a sliver of air between them, his lips hovering in the space above Jimin\u2019s, their breath mingling. He could count Jimin\u2019s eyelashes if he wanted, lose himself in the warm brown of Jimin\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d he whispers, and they\u2019re too close, so close that his lips brush Jimin\u2019s when they move. Jungkook forgets how to breathe.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s fingers run from Jungkook\u2019s nape through his hair. He pulls him down.</p>\n<p>His lips are softer than Jungkook has ever imagined, plush against his. He kisses his lower lip once, twice, three times, tugging it between his own. Hesitant, slow like he\u2019s savoring it, memorizing the way Jimin feels. His free hand moves to Jimin\u2019s hip, the other keeping him upright so he hovers over him. When he pulls away Jimin chases his lips for another kiss. His hands thread through Jungkook\u2019s hair, tugging him closer. If Jungkook were poetic he\u2019d compare the kiss to stars exploding from Jimin\u2019s mouth to his; maybe he\u2019d say kissing Jimin felt like going home after a long, hard day. Maybe he\u2019d marvel that nothing has ever kindled him to flames with the ease that Jimin\u2019s touch does. But all he thinks is that he\u2019s really, really fucking happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin breathes against his lips. The name sounds new and beautiful like Jimin\u2019s never said it before\u2014not like this, not so close Jungkook can <em>feel</em> him say it, so close they\u2019re breathing the same air.</p>\n<p>Jimin kisses him again and Jungkook melts into him. He kisses away the longing and the regret and all the doubt until there\u2019s nothing but this, nothing but Jeon Jungkook and Park Jimin and the feelings that have gathered between them. And if Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure before he\u2019s sure now; Jimin\u2019s all he wants.</p>\n<p>They break away to breathe. Jimin\u2019s cheeks are pink. Jungkook\u2019s sure his own are, too, his hair mussed. He\u2019s almost entirely positive that he\u2019s never seen anything as beautiful as Jimin lying under him with a flushed face and soft eyes. He trails his fingers along Jimin\u2019s cheek, down his neck, touch as light as can be.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been waiting for this for a long time. Since the first time he saw Jimin, sitting in the dining hall with a pretty pout on his lips. An innumerable amount of missed chances have passed between then and now, but finally. Finally.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cthat maybe I more than like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs, breathless. \u201cDon\u2019t move so fast, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s face heats up. He likes the way that sounds, likes it more than anything. He hides his face in Jimin\u2019s neck, grinning. God, he\u2019s had so many boys and girls call him \u2018baby\u2019 but nobody\u2019s ever made him feel like Jimin. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever stop marveling at the way Jimin makes him feel. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin says, and now he\u2019s really laughing. \u201c<em>Baby</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Jungkook mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cCute.\u201d He kisses the top of Jungkook\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls back to look at him again. \u201cAm I\u2014you think we\u2019re moving fast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jimin strokes his thumb along Jungkook\u2019s mouth. \u201cBut I\u2019m not better, Jungkook. This\u2014all of this still scares me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook can tell it\u2019s difficult for him to admit it. He leans down to drop a kiss to the corner of Jimin\u2019s mouth. \u201cThen we\u2019ll take it slow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should talk about this, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the morning. We can worry about it in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop.\u201d Jungkook lies back down, flushing. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s fucking blushing at being called \u2018baby.\u2019</p>\n<p>Jimin shifts closer to him, throwing his around Jungkook\u2019s waist and curling into his chest. Jungkook wraps an arm around Jimin\u2019s shoulders, tucking him close. \u201cGoodnight, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hyung</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes up to Jimin\u2019s hand stroking his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d he hears Jimin murmur. \u201cWe gotta get going.\u201d</p>\n<p>He opens his eyes slowly, groggy from sleep. Jimin\u2019s lying on his side at eye-level, face puffy and hair sticking up in various directions. Jungkook slings his arm around Jimin\u2019s waist and tugs him close so he can plant a kiss on his lips. \u201cFive more minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a meeting today, idiot,\u201d he says fondly before pulling away and slipping out of bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin snorts. Jungkook rolls onto his back, stretching, and watches Jimin slip out of his t-shirt and shorts and into yesterday\u2019s clothes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo does this mean I get to see your ass tattoo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pauses in digging his toothbrush out of his bag and looks over. \u201cListen, we haven\u2019t even figured out where we\u2019re going with all this yet. I don\u2019t fuck on the first date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jimin smirks. \u201cI fuck before the first date.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way he\u2019s looking at him, eyes hooded, makes Jungkook shiver. \u201cIs this our first date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I guess we better get that out of the way before we have one, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin wags his toothbrush at Jungkook, the sultry look replaced with an amused one. \u201cNice try, big boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me. This one time I got a straight guy to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>A banging on the hotel room door interrupts him. \u201cCheckout in one hour,\u201d the manager shouts from the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin calls back. He tosses Jungkook\u2019s pants at him. \u201cTime to get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time they make it to the car, Jungkook\u2019s high has worn off. He\u2019s remembered the purpose of their trip and what awaits them at the end of it. He tries starting Tony three times before the engine finally revs, but then he just sits there, shoulders slumping.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore we go. We should talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the corner of his eye, he sees Jimin nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take things slow, like you said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can come visit. Busan\u2019s only four hours away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a car. I can take the bus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can make it work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the distance will be good for me, maybe. Help me ease into things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy grandparents always wanted me to move to Busan after graduating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s startled into a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t look so far ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at right now. One day at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p>\n<p>They look over at each other at the same time, and they\u2019re both smiling. \u201cYeah. We will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shifts the gear to drive and pulls out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p>The trip doesn\u2019t feel so daunting anymore, knowing that goodbye no longer waits at the end of it. It wasn\u2019t inevitable after all. It\u2019ll be a <em>see you later</em>, this time, and maybe they won\u2019t ever have to say goodbye again.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has come a very long way from the boy who begged Taehyung for a phone number and ended up with a bet that changed his life. He\u2019s come a very long way from the boy who hid from the others in high school bathrooms, from the boy who cried before graduation because his crush laughed at him when he confessed, from the boy who spent a year and a half of university trying to prove himself to no one but himself. Those experiences won\u2019t ever go away; he\u2019ll always be who he is because of them. But over the course of the past year he\u2019s learned not to let to them control him, and that\u2019s all that matters.</p>\n<p>He thinks about the series of strange coincidences that led him to Jimin, and how they had almost made him believe in fate. Taehyung will tell him it was destiny that led them together, the universe moving in its infinite wisdom to bring them to this point in time, where they can look at each other and be honest instead of guarded. Maybe it was fate. Or maybe it was just a line of strange coincidences, happenstance, the universe\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he\u2019s just thinking too hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, baby,\u201d Jimin says, and Jungkook smiles.</p>"
