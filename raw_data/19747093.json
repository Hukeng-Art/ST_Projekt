  "summary": "<p>Poseidon keeps getting offerings from Percy\u2019s baby sister. He doesn\u2019t quite know how to feel about this small child vying for his attention\u2026At the very least he would keep Zeus from blowing up whenever her prayers interrupted council meetings. </p>\n<p>Or</p>\n<p>Rick Riordan gave us Estelle Blofis and I am thrilled. She's going to get Poseidon to attend family events even if every god on Olympus kills her.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>BRUH - quick fun fact. Back when I was 13, PJO was the very first fandom I wrote for. I was using the original Fanfiction back then and you will not believe me when I tell you I found my very first account. I am shook. </p>\n<p>At any rate, I just found Estelle is a thing and I am so very pleased. Here's an entire fic dedicated to her being an awesome sister.</p>",
  "text": "<p>A girl was calling his name.</p>\n<p>Poseidon wasn\u2019t entirely sure why \u2013 five-year-olds didn\u2019t have adept knowledge in Greek mythology so the god was a bit at loss, but nevertheless.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle?\u201d Hermes frowned and Poseidon glanced up. They were in a council meeting and this child\u2019s calls kept echoing across the room. Poseidon sighed and offered a small shrug of his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she calls to me,\u201d He answered \u201cI\u2019ve never heard her voice before.\u201d He said and Zeus shot him an irritated look as the small voice called out again. She must have been in his domain \u2013 there was no other way her voice could sound so clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps, you sired another child?\u201d Hera suggested coldly, but the sea god was already shaking his head. \u201cWhy else would she call to you?\u201d the goddess scoffed, but Zeus had lifted a hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnswer her, brother.\u201d He told him tightly \u201cSo we may get on with this meeting.\u201d He sniffed and Poseidon resisted the urge to sigh. His mind wracked with confusion, unsure of what image he would be greeted with when he waved his hand. As he suspected a beach view appeared in front of them\u2026Montauk, he realized.</p>\n<p>\u201cPoe-sigh-den\u201d The girl was calling, drawing out the word as she focused on each syllable of the name. Her nose was wrinkled as she called out, her eyes looking hopeful at the sea as the waves crashed in front of her. Poseidon frowned, but when he went to respond, was cut off by a new voice joining.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Guppy?\u201d</p>\n<p>From across the room, Athena made a reproachful noise and Poseidon froze.</p>\n<p>\u201cPercy!\u201d The girl giggled and sure enough, his son entered the scene. He was in beach gear \u2013 his blue swim trunks matching the little girl's suit and hair windswept, filled with sand as he sat next to the child.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for your daddy!\u201d The girl informed him seriously and held out a seashell to him. \u201cI\u2019m giving him\u2026offers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOfferings?\u201d Percy smiled \u201cI\u2019m sure he would like the seashells, Estelle.\u201d He told her and the girl grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll answer though. He\u2019s a busy guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Estelle said, lowering the shells. She looked out towards the ocean, nose wrinkling in disappointment as she kicked the sand. Percy's brows rose.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you want to meet him?\u201d He asked slowly and his gaze left her for a moment to look out into the sea. The waves lapped towards them, flicking at their toes as Estelle seemed to mumble for a few moments, trying to find the words for whatever she wanted to say. Percy patiently waited.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026You know <em>my</em> daddy.\u201d Estelle explained and then paused. Her lower lip pushed out for a moment before she shrugged and started drawing absently in the sand with her foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Percy frowned, looking a bit uncomfortable. \u201cWell\u2026You know, your dad is my family too.\u201d Percy started, but Estelle shook her head. For someone who looked like she could barely read, this little girl seemed very...Aware.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you have a whole other family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s a bit complicated. I don\u2019t see them that much, so you really don\u2019t need to make that effort, Estelle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you miss them?\u201d She asked, eyes wide as she looked up at him. Sally's eyes. She had Sally's eyes. Poseidon almost jerked back at the realization. Mortal years went by so quickly...He had known about Paul Blofis, of course. He just hadn't realized they had...This. A child. Percy's seemingly random interaction with her made much more sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026Well,\" Percy was stumbling as he bit at his lip \"I don\u2019t know them well enough to really miss them. It isn\u2019t like mom and Paul. Or Annabeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Piper!\u201d Estelle said eagerly with a clap of her hands \u201cAnd Hazel! And Grover! And Leo! And Frank! And-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I get the picture.\u201d Percy laughed and nudged her. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit different.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little girl let her lower lip pop out slightly as she fell back in the sand. For a second they sat in silence, Percy staring out towards the horizon and Estelle turning large blue eyes onto him. Poseidon wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Part of him felt ready to close the connection when Estelle spoke again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDaddy said bad things happened to you because of your family.\u201d She said quietly and picked up a seashell to roll between her hands. Percy\u2019s gaze snapped to her before he sighed, running a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about it, Guppy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to,\u201d She argued back \u201cI don\u2019t want bad things to happen to you.\u201d She told him and clenched her fists \u201cAre more bad things going to happen to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI -\u201d Percy started and swallowed \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He said, voice almost falling to a whisper. Something hard and dark flashed in his eyes before it disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. \u201cEstelle, this is kind of adult stuff. You don\u2019t need to worry. We\u2019ll all protect you and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to protect <em>you</em>.\u201d Estelle interrupted and repeated it again quietly \u201cI want to protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Percy stared before nodding slowly. Glancing over his shoulder, he moved closer to her side before lifting out his hands. Instantly water flew to him. Estelle\u2019s face brightened, but she didn\u2019t seem shocked by Percy\u2019s powers. Either she had seen it before or the mist was affecting her. The water swirled around Percy\u2019s palm before he offered it to her. Estelle instantly took ahold of the ball and began poking at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know people can\u2019t normally do that stuff, right?\u201d He asked her \u201cNobody can make lightning like Thalia or talk to ghosts like Nico.\u201d He said and Poseidon pursed his lips. It would seem that the girl had inherited her mother's sight then. Estelle paused in staring at the ball of water to frown at her brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause our parents are very special. They have all sorts of powers that we sometimes learn how to use.\u201d He explained and Estelle nodded, her eyes entranced by the water Percy was spinning around. \u201cBut there are monsters out there who don\u2019t like that sort of thing, Estelle. They want to hurt us. That\u2019s what your dad meant. I had to stop some monsters in the past and\u2026 It was kind of scary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were scared?\u201d Estelle asked, looking at him through narrowed eyes. She wrinkled her nose at him, as if she wasn't totally sure if he was lying. Percy laughed softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely <em>terrified</em>. But you know when I wasn\u2019t scared?\u201d He asked and smiled a bit more when Estelle shook her head \u201cWhen I was with mom. Or with your dad. Or you. Because you guys remind me why I need to fight the monsters. So you already kind of protect me a lot, Guppy.\u201d He nudged her and Estelle seemed to consider this.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes your dad protect you too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think sometimes he does.\u201d Percy told her.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t make you brave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. He doesn\u2019t.\u201d Percy shook his head and lowered his hand. The water turned to steam. Ruffling her hair, Estelle seemed to mull this over for a couple minutes in silence before standing up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She declared and launched herself at the demigod. Percy caught her with ease, laughing in her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d He murmured and rose, grabbing her hand. \u201cWant some cake? Mom made it blue!\u201d He beamed and Estelle\u2019s eyes brightened. She took a few steps forward before pausing, causing Percy to stop walking when he felt her let go of his hand. Quickly she ran back to the shore and threw one more seashell into the waters.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Poseidon.\u201d She said, stumbling over his name \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s safe and brave.\u201d She told the waves. Possibly to be extra certain he received her message she threw another shell in. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go eat cake!\u201d She beamed and this time, dragged Percy to the cabin behind them.</p>\n<p>\u201cPOSEIDON!\u201d</p>\n<p>Estelle Blofis\u2019 yell almost shattered the throne room. Poseidon had received a few messages from Perseus' little sister since that day on the beach, but never had they been so <em>angry</em>. Zeus stopped whatever he was saying to roll his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re receiving an offering, brother.\u201d He muttered and Poseidon winced, swiping open the connection to see a very angry ten-year-old standing on the beach. She was beginning to look so much like Sally it hurt. The wind was whipping her hair around as thunder rolled in the background, no doubt a side effect of Zeus\u2019 annoyance.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better be listening.\u201d She growled and Poseidon blinked. There was an air of threat to her words, but the idea that this small being could pose any sort of danger to him was laughable. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d She snapped out. Poseidon froze.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hera</em>.\u201d He hissed, spinning to look at the queen. If she had touched his son again \u2013 after the last war and <em>everything</em> he had been through\u2026 He might have to intervene.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Perseus.\u201d Hera told him, chin jutted out and eyes flashing. Poseidon racked his mind to think of the last time he had heard from Percy. A couple days ago he had received an offering\u2026 But why would only Estelle Blofis be complaining? Where was Athena\u2019s child or any of his friends? A bit of irritation shot through him at the idea that these other demigods would so easily dismiss his son's absence. The water around Estelle trembled slightly as his anger rose.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just <em>take</em> him.\u201d She continued, voice rising and Poseidon turned back to see tears were running down her face, her fists clenched by her sides. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do <em>anything</em>! He didn\u2019t!\u201d She screeched, hysteria leaking into her voice. \u201cPercy said you were nice. Why\u2026?\u201d She trailed off and closed her eyes as if trying to keep the tears at bay.</p>\n<p>\u201cEstelle \u2013 damnit, ESTELLE!\u201d Somebody yelled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is he doing this?!\u201d Estelle yelled back and to Poseidon\u2019s confusion, Percy appeared. Dark circles were under his eyes and his hair, while usually wild, was now practically untameable. Quickly he walked up to his sister and grabbed her hand, trying to tug her away from the shore.</p>\n<p>\u201cEstelle, this won\u2019t help. Come on.\u201d He coaxed. What was he? Twenty-seven now? He barely saw any of his children this age.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, <em>no</em>.\u201d Estelle struggled \u201cY-you said!\u201d She blinked accusingly at him \u201cYou said he was nice! Why is he doing this? Why won\u2019t he give him back?\u201d She cried and Percy sighed, pulling her in a bit closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cEstelle, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.\u201d Percy said \u201cWe need to give him some more time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould he kill him?\u201d Estelle sobbed, tugging at her hair \u201cYour dad loved mom, right? Would that mean he would kill my dad?\u201d She whispered and shook her head \u201cYou said he was <em>nice</em>.\u201d She repeated, voice shaking. Her <em>dad</em>? Poseidon pressed a finger into his temple.</p>\n<p>\u201cEstelle,\u201d Percy said and knelt down in front of her \u201cNobody is dead right now. Okay? Nobody. I\u2019m going to find Paul. Sometimes when people are in the middle of an ocean their phones or radios don\u2019t always work. It doesn\u2019t mean anything bad has happened. It\u2019s only been a few days. I\u2019ll go and I\u2019ll find him, alright?\u201d He promised, pushing her hair back \u201cBut you can\u2019t go screaming at Poseidon. It might only make things worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said he was nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody can be nice all the time.\u201d Percy said carefully \u201cI don\u2019t think he would ever hurt your dad, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll take kindly to be yelled at either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should yell at him.\u201d She muttered, though now seemingly appeased as she leaned into Percy\u2019s shoulder. A smile flickered on Percy\u2019s face, but he only shook his head at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Guppy. I\u2019ll make you some hot chocolate or something.\u201d He murmured and for a second Perseus' eyes flickered to exactly where the screen was.</p>\n<p><em>Please tell me you didn\u2019t have anything to do with this,</em> his voice called out. Poseidon sighed. He liked Paul Blofis. Truly. He was a good man who was kind to Sally and Percy, and had the <em>best</em> last name. The idea that everyone thought he was apparently responsible for the man\u2019s disappearance was a little insulting. What was Paul even doing out in the middle of the ocean anyways? Wasn\u2019t he a teacher?</p>\n<p>Still. He wasn\u2019t going to freak out because apparently his <em>nice-ness</em> was in question too.</p>\n<p>He waved his hand and for a second the waves went quiet and the sea calmed. Percy\u2019s eyes trailed over the shoreline, arm still around Estelle and nodded. He offered a small smile and turned back to the cabin behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I have no friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my \u2013 we\u2019re in the middle of a <em>council meeting</em>!\u201d Zeus complained as the connection opened. Estelle\u2019s voice echoed around the room, making Apollo snort at the declaration.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because I\u2019m a weirdo who can see monsters and the only people who talk to me are part god\u2026but maybe I\u2019m overthinking it,\u201d Estelle continued \u201cPercy says you\u2019re usually too busy to answer, but I figured I would throw you an offering and share my woes. Do gods have some sort of voicemail thing set up?\u201d She mused and Hermes hummed, giving a noncommittal shrug.</p>\n<p>Poseidon sighed and opened the connection. Estelle looked to be twelve now. It was a bit strange... Everyone said Perseus looked like Poseidon. He thought his son looked quite a bit like him, but looking at Estelle... He must looked more like Sally than he realized. The two seemed similar in a strange way.</p>\n<p>\u201cI also feel like I should apologize for yelling at you a couple years ago. My dad is fine. Sorry I thought you brutally murdered him\u2026 The way Percy talks about you sometimes though. It just kind of worries me? Like. He says you\u2019re cool and stuff, but he\u2019s really big on me being cautious not to offend you\u2026 He probably wouldn\u2019t want me talking to you now.\u201d She said and kicked the sand \u201cAh. Well. He\u2019s off fighting some monster so he can\u2019t stop me.\u201d She told him and sat down in the sand. \u201cAlso, did you know he\u2019s getting <em>married</em>. Like. Gross.\u201d She muttered. A murmur immediately rose around the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cMARRIED?!\u201d Aphrodite gasped, reminding Poseidon that - once again - others were present \u201cHow did I not know about this? Oh my-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like Annabeth and all \u2013 she\u2019s the <em>coolest</em> but if they get married then I\u2019m never going to see Percy again. He\u2019s going to live with her in California or something and have kids and \u2013 <em>ugh</em>. Maybe I should ask Thalia if I be a huntress or something.\u201d\u00a0 She mused. Artemis tilted her head at that, but Poseidon had admittedly tuned the girl out a little because\u2026No. He hadn\u2019t known his son was getting married. Not that he was expecting an invitation or anything\u2026</p>\n<p>Quite frankly, it was a bit of unknown territory for him. Sure, he had children who had gotten married\u2026Back when people got married much younger and the relationship in question was a few days old. This was somehow\u2026Different. Important in a way he hadn\u2019t been properly introduced to yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you <em>do</em> come to the wedding that would be nice\u2026Because then I could actually meet you and it would be super funny to see Percy kind of freak out a little. I don\u2019t think he expects you to show up. Annabeth said gods don\u2019t usually attend these kind of events... I\u2019m not sure if she means weddings or mortal events or demigods events\u2026 I attend them all so I can\u2019t relate. Which brings me back to my aforementioned issue. Is there a god of friendship I should have knowledge of? Because the last conversation I had was with Uncle Nico\u2019s summoned ghost\u2026And that was to help me with a history project\u2026To which I <em>still</em> failed because I didn\u2019t label my sources! As if I can say \u2018Mr. Turner, I obviously just asked Abraham Lincoln about his assassination! He was very willing to tell me about it for three hours\u2019. Oh, and before that? My last conversation was with Uncle Frank while he was in bird form. I am somehow a freak among mortals.\u201d Estelle sighed. \u201cAnd you know what stupid advice your son gave me? Be <em>myself</em>. I love him. I do. But I could have gotten that off of a milk carton.\u201d She muttered and sighed, dipping her toe into the water.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen again, he\u2019s had bigger problems than making <em>friends</em>,\u201d She added and there were a few beats of silence. \u201cAnd now my most recent conversation is me talking to the ocean with the uncertainty that an ancient god is listening \u2013 for the love of\u2026 I\u2019ve fallen too far.\u201d She moaned and collapsed into the sand, throwing an arm over her eyes \u201cI\u2019m going to end up as one of those crazy old ladies in the movies who everyone thinks is senile, but it turns out she knows things.\u201d She grumbled and scowled at the water from under her arm.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Hi Estelle.\u201d A voice called and the girl jumped a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Hey there, bro\u2026How long have you been listening?\u201d Estelle asked warily as Percy sat next to her, covered in monster dust. He shrugged and gently nudged her with his leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently my advice is milk carton level?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get over the pain,\u201d Percy snorted \u201cYou, Annabeth, and Nico really know how to keep my ego down.\u201d He added, wiping a fake tear from his eye. Estelle scoffed, but propped herself up on her elbows before gesturing out to the sea.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am inviting your father to the wedding. I was just about to say I\u2019d be willing to get him a throne on your side of aisle if he shows.\u201d She said and Percy rolled his eyes as he tried to flick the side of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he shows then Athena might show up out of spite\u2026Then we\u2019ll have a bloodbath instead of a wedding.\u201d He said flatly and Estelle rose an eyebrow \u201cIt\u2019s a whole feud they have. My dad wanted Athens named after him so he offered the people this super cool spring and Athena grew them an olive tree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026And they picked the olive tree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess it was salt water so they couldn\u2019t drink it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, yeah, but I\u2019m sure it looked awesome,\u201d Estelle mused and Percy grinned. \u201cIt could have been like\u2026An ancient Six Flags.\u201d She said with a clap of her hands. Poseidon nodded to himself. The young mortal obviously saw something that those fools could not. Percy tipped his head back to laugh, eyes sparkling with amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell that to Annabeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not.\u201d Estelle snorted and looked out towards the sea \u201cDo you think he\u2019s actually listening?\u201d She mused and tossed a seashell into the sand \u201cOr even knows I exist?\u201d</p>\n<p>Percy didn\u2019t answer. Instead he just watched the waves roll over before turning to his sister and smiling weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. He\u2019s-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery busy, yeah.\u201d Estelle interrupted. She tilted her head at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It must have been lonely growing up.\u201d She said and Percy blinked at her. \u201cMom told me about\u2026About your first step-father\u2026\u201d She began cautiously. Immediately, Percy tensed. \u201cI would have been angry that Poseidon never helped.\u201d She said and Percy thrummed his fingers on his thigh for a few moments.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all complicated. Gods and their children. In the past, it was much worse. Some would go unclaimed for their entire lives or completely ignored for years. Some even were killed just to get some sort of recognition.\u201d He sighed and ran a hand through his hair \u201cI\u2019m really lucky I never had that happen to me.\u201d He said. Estelle shrugged. \u201cThere really is only so much you can expect from them, Estelle.\u201d Percy continued, yanking lightly at her hair. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure why you\u2026\u201d He began and trailed off, fixing his sister with a puzzled look.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s your dad.\u201d Estelle said, poking him with her knee \u201cJust because he sucks at the whole family thing doesn\u2019t mean I have to. I\u2019m a <em>good</em> sister\u2026And that means I\u2019m going to try and get to know your crazy godly relatives even if they never answer.\u201d She said with a firm nod. Percy bit his lip. \u201c\u2026without getting blown up, hopefully.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Estelle-</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d She continued, talking loudly over her brother\u2019s upcoming lecture \u201cMom fell in love with him once, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is how I came to be\u2026\u201d Percy muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust saying. At the very least\u2026I know he has good taste in women.\u201d She said with a flip of her hair \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed but\u2026Our mom is <em>kind of</em> awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was blessed with an amazing, powerful godly parent\u2026And Poseidon.\u201d Percy told her and Estelle snorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get blown up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you lecture <em>me?\u201d</em> Percy gasped in fake offense before tackling her. \u201cThe <em>audacity</em>!\u201d He yelled over her giggles before pulling the girl up. \u201cCome on. Annabeth says you get to taste wedding cakes with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>!\u201d Estelle yelled, pumping her arm in the air \u201cNow hear me out because I\u2019m going to say something controversial\u2026\u201d She warned, tossing one more seashell over her shoulder \u201c<em>Blue</em> velvet cake. Huh?\u201d She said and Percy put a hand over his chest in feigned shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cPoseidon\u2026\u201d Athena warned with narrowed eyes as the message receded \u201cDo not think about attending that wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hm. The god smiled and straightened himself in his seat. While he remained undecided on the wedding front\u2026He could never not resist taunting his foe.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? Did you not hear I received an invitation? A pity you did not\u2026\u201d He clicked his tongue and Zeus sighed, possibly giving up on a council meeting altogether.</p>\n<p>It had been thousands of years since a mortal stepped foot on Olympus.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t unheard of by any means. Zeus had once been quite fond of allowing kings and conquests flutter in their halls. Ares would occasionally bring particularly impressive warriors over for entertainment purposes and Apollo\u2019s lyre had been known enchant one or two mortals to the top of their mountain.</p>\n<p>Still, those days had been in Greece. Perhaps Rachel Dare had entered once or twice. Poseidon no longer spent much time on Olympus to know. As it was, he was only here because of the Winter Solstice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand you killed the Minotaur.\u201d Zeus said, voice tight and formal. For once, Poseidon didn\u2019t blame him. The girl <em>had</em> just marched into the room unannounced, covered in blood and golden dust that signified she had either killed a monster or lost a fight with an aggressive pixie.</p>\n<p>From behind her, Nico di Angelo\u2019s eyes flickered over them, not offering any sort of explanation. His hand was on his sword \u2013 though Poseidon doubted it would provide any sort of protection here. It explained how the mortal got up here at least. Their security guard probably stood no chance against Hades\u2019 son.</p>\n<p>The girl blinked, as if just realizing this herself as she looked down at the horn in her hand. She turned to look back at di Angelo who nodded before turning back with a bow of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d She said and surprisingly walked forward to place the horn at Hades\u2019 feet. \u201cAn offering\u2026It was suggested I up my antics since my previous prayers were not answered.\u201d She told him simply and backed away. Poseidon felt his brows come together slightly. She was giving <em>Hades</em> offerings now? And was barging into Olympus to ensure an answer? Poseidon couldn't help but feel a little indignant that she hadn't burst in on his account.</p>\n<p>Despite the current situation\u2026Poseidon couldn\u2019t help but note how much she looked like Sally. The hair. The eyes. The only difference between the pair would have been the sprinkling of freckles that dotted Estelle\u2019s face and the expression she was wearing. That\u2026That made her almost look like Percy. He was reminded of his son's face after the Titan war. Tired. Angry. Scared. Hades looked down at the horn before turning back to the girl. It was a high honor...To receive such an offering on such an important night. Whatever she wanted...She wanted it badly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard your requests, child.\u201d He said and tilted his head \u201cFrom <em>multiple</em> sources.\u201d He added wryly, eyes dancing to where di Angelo was lifting a subtle eyebrow at his father. \u201cI am afraid I simply cannot fulfill it.\u201d He told her and Estelle\u2019s jaw tightened. For a moment there was only silence as she seemed to digest the information.</p>\n<p>\u201cFather,\u201d Nico spoke quietly and put a warning hand on the mortal\u2019s arm \u201cYou have been unusually\u2026Resistant on this matter. I can\u2019t even summon-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do you not think there are reasons for that, child?\u201d Hades snapped out and immediately the demigod back off. Not without a purse of his lips though. A chill flooded the room and for a second, even Poseidon could feel the boy\u2019s power radiate throughout the room before forcing itself back down.</p>\n<p>Estelle was not so dissuaded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to see my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poseidon frowned. He had been confused, a bit, by her entrance. Not that she killed a monster \u2013 she clearly could see through the mist and he had no doubt that Perseus had taught her how to defend herself even if such things weren\u2019t drawn to her\u2026 but he wasn\u2019t sure why she had gone through all of the trouble of coming to Olympus to hand over the spoils. He turned to Hades, realization slowly dawning on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou believe him to be dead?\u201d He asked, unable to stop the question from leaving his lips. Estelle\u2019s gaze snapped to him. It had been quite some time, he realized, since she had prayed to him. In mortal terms\u2026It might have been even longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you unaware?\u201d She asked coolly. Nico\u2019s eyes widened and he reached forward to tug her back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe thank you for the audience,\u201d He said quickly, but the mortal jerked herself away. \u201c<em>Estelle-</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNico can\u2019t even summon him,\u201d She demanded, turning back to Hades \u201cWhy? If there\u2019s a reason just give me that. I need\u2026I <em>have</em> to speak to him. I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying,\u201d Nico interrupted, a little annoyed as he glowered at Estelle \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he choose rebirth?\u201d She turned to the demigod \u201cThat\u2019s what happened with Bianca, right?\u201d She tried, voice wavering slightly. di Angelo froze at that. The mention of his sister seemed to momentarily stun him into silence as Estelle turned to face the rest of the council. \u201cI need <em>something</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hades stared. Poseidon internally debated if he would defend this child. She was Sally\u2019s daughter after all\u2026And Percy cherished her greatly. Luckily, Hades didn\u2019t strike her down immediately (though Zeus looked like he might). Instead he sighed and smoothed out his robes as if the souls of the damned had a wrinkle in them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot grant your request because Perseus Jackson is not <em>dead</em>.\u201d He finally said and both Estelle and Nico seemed to freeze at this admission.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026That\u2019s not possible,\u201d Nico blinked \u201cWill and I were there. Annabeth was there. I <em>felt</em> his soul leave.\u201d He said and Hades smiled wryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed, you did,\u201d The god agreed \u201cIt seemed to have found its way back.\u201d He said with a sideways look at Poseidon. He shifted a bit. Right. He might have been involved in this\u2026Slightly. He had felt his son's soul withering - giving into death and had suggested to Hades to maybe turn a blind eye and give him a few more years. Hades may not like his son...For many reasons, but there was no doubt he understood and...On some level even respected everything Percy had done. Poseidon tried to keep that in mind when his brother was especially irksome.</p>\n<p>\"Where is he then?\" di Angelo asked, shaking his head \"It's been a month. Wouldn't he have found us by now?\" He asked and Hades hesitated.</p>\n<p>\"Be patient. He will return.\" Was all he said. Estelle went to open her mouth but Nico cleared his throat, giving her a look. He must have gotten through to her because the fight from her drained. Slowly, she took a breath before raising herself to her full height and giving a low bow.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\" She said, but she only met Hades' eyes. \"Thank you.\" She repeated softly and stood. For a moment their eyes met and Poseidon watched her mouth open slightly as if she might say something. He waited, but she only gave a nod and turned from the room with di Angelo in tow. Silence followed their exit.</p>\n<p>\"Why <em>isn't</em> my son back with his family?\" He finally asked, turning to look Hades over warily. The god sniffed.</p>\n<p>\"I think you underestimate how close to death he truly was. Even with my powers...It took much.\" He said and looked at the spot his son had been standing. \"It might have been kinder to perhaps let him die.\" He mused and leaned back in his throne. Aphrodite was putting her hands together, leaning forward with interest twinkling in her eyes. \"I have been waiting,\" Hades admitted \"His body is healed but I had hoped he would be more...Alive when I returned him. For my son's sake.\" He finally said.</p>\n<p>Poseidon didn't know what to make of that. So he nodded at Zeus to continue the council.</p>\n<p>\"My brother is different.\"</p>\n<p>For once, Poseidon was alone when she called. It had been the first in awhile and when he opened the message he could see Estelle on some sort of pier that definitely wasn't Montauk. He let his powers investigate and nodded. Pacific. She must be in California. Estelle lazily threw in a shell.</p>\n<p>\"He acts the same...But I can tell. All of us can tell. It's like he's still dead and is just faking it...\" She explained and went quiet \"This is your fault.\"</p>\n<p>Poseidon had expected to hear those words. Still, he had expected them from Percy. Irritation flashed through him and the sea around her began to thrash aggressively. Estelle paused, eyes widening ever so slightly.</p>\n<p>\"You <em>can</em> hear me,\" She mused and sat up straighter \"You realize parents are supposed to take <em>care</em> of their kids, right? All I've ever heard was excuses for you. You're too busy. Too powerful. That it's <em>different</em> for godly parents. They can't show favoritism. They can't give aide. Apparently caring can cause a war.\" She snapped out and took her feet out from the water, crossing them under her. \"It all seemed stupid to me. He's your son. Your <em>family</em>. It shouldn't be that complicated...You had him <em>knowing</em> how hard his life would be...Even for a demigod. You broke that stupid oath because you <em>loved</em> my mom. So why are you letting her son suffer? It doesn't make any sense to me.\" She said looking down \"I'm supposed to be careful not to offend you...but God. Strike me down. Just help Percy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Estelle.\"</p>\n<p>Poseidon's waves stopped momentarily as Athena's girl spoke. She looked...Older. Older than he had ever thought possible for a Greek demigod.</p>\n<p>\"Hi.\" Estelle muttered and looked out to the sea \"I'm going to die soon.\" She announced and Annabeth grimaced.</p>\n<p>\"You really might,\" She said looking around them warily \"And for no reason.\" She added, sitting down. \"Estelle...Percy and I came out of Tatarus. He's survived much, much worse. Give him a bit more time and he'll be okay.\" She told her, but Estelle didn't seem placated by this in the least. In fact, she grabbed another shell in the pile and hurled it in the ocean.</p>\n<p>\"<em>That's not the point</em><em>!\"</em> She yelled and gave a shaky breath \"It's that it <em>keeps</em> happening and he - he does <em>nothing</em>!\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not true. I think Poseidon played a very large role in keeping Percy alive this time.\" Annabeth said sharply and Poseidon nodded. He may not like Athena, but at least her daughter showed some promise. Estelle closed her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"That's...That was very...Considerate of him.\" She said lowly and shook her head \"It just seems like he could do the simple things. The important ones.\"</p>\n<p>\"Like what?\" Annabeth asked, though Poseidon was fairly certain she was just humoring the girl.</p>\n<p>\"Showing up.\" Estelle said immediately and Annabeth sighed.</p>\n<p>\"Gods can't-\"</p>\n<p>\"Why not?\" Estelle demanded \"I don't get it. I...I'm sorry, I just don't. I think they suck and you guys come up with reasons to accept their shitty behavior. And the fact they were <em>worse</em> before Percy called them out on it after the Titan war?\" She laughed and shook her head \"All of you deserve better but...My brother deserves the <em>best</em>, okay? Not because he's the hero of Olympus. Not because he is a child of not one - but <em>two</em> prophecies. Not because he's killed giants and titans and hundreds of monsters. Not because he turned down immortality or <em>any</em> of that. He deserves it because he's my brother. That's all there is to it. That's how family works...And those gods...They aren't family. They just...Helped make you. So I've had enough of them calling on heroes when they need them because they aren't family. You don't owe them anything.\" She hissed and kicked the rest of the shells into the water. Annabeth flinched, hand on her blade as she watched around them warily. No doubt all of Olympus was listening to the tirade now.</p>\n<p>Still. Nobody struck. Poseidon wondered if the fates were somehow protecting her.</p>\n<p>\"Estelle...\" Annabeth finally said and put a hand on her shoulder \"I'm sorry.\"</p>\n<p>Poseidon wasn't sure why she was the one apologizing, but perhaps that was something only humans could understand.</p>\n<p>His name was Luke.</p>\n<p>He was...Well. He was small. With black hair and what looked to be gray eyes. Annabeth and Percy were both passed out somewhere in the master bedroom. Poseidon could feel Percy's exhaustion and almost scoffed. It didn't feel all that different from the exhaustion he had after a battle. He supposed that said something about childcare.</p>\n<p>The baby babbled at him, tilting his head as he reached up towards his grandfather from where he sat in his crib. Poseidon had quieted him down a few times now - ensuring his parents got some much needed sleep.</p>\n<p>\"He likes you.\"</p>\n<p>Poseidon didn't look up. He had known Estelle was here. Had expected her to show up sooner or later.</p>\n<p>\"I visited Perseus like this once,\" He mused and looked up at her briefly to see she was in pajamas, hair mused from a night of tossing and turning. \"He was very powerful...You could tell even at that age.\" He mused and Estelle's lips pursed together. Poseidon smiled and dug into his pocket before revealing a seashell. He handed it to her. \"An offering.\" He announced and Estelle blinked, taking the shell slowly.</p>\n<p>\"I don't understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't doubt that,\" He snorted and looked back at Luke. \"I had to stop many gods from killing you Estelle Blofis...I even had a temptation myself once or twice.\" He said, letting uncertainty flicker over him \"I'm not sure there are many mortals who could get away with such words.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why did you let me?\" Estelle asked and Poseidon tilted his head at her, considering. She looked a little nervous. No doubt, she had never expected to actually speak to him face to face...Or at least given that up long ago.</p>\n<p>\"Because you are my son's sister. And that's how family works.\" He said, echoing her words.</p>\n<p>Estelle eyes widened marginally. He would have laughed at her if he didn't think the sound might rile Luke up. As it was, the baby's babbling was getting louder.</p>\n<p>\"I am not human, Estelle. Nor will I understand them. My kind do not experience emotions quite as you do. Or have the same understanding of such concepts as family. We represent them, yes...but in reality it is humans who encompass such things.\" He said and flicked his wrist so a ball of water appeared, quieting Luke a little as he gawked in wonder. \"My godly children and I...We have never...\" He began and shook his head. His godly children had never needed or wanted much from him.</p>\n<p>\"But Percy is half-human.\" Estelle pointed out lowly and Poseidon's eyes snapped to her \"Shouldn't you at least consider accommodating that part of him... sir?\" She added on hastily. Poseidon tilted his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I don't think I've ever met someone quite as human as you.\" He said and straightened up \"Perhaps.\"</p>\n<p>And that was all he gave her before disappearing.</p>\n<p>Perseus looked like he was torn between screaming, crying, and maybe just dying altogether.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" He said pointing a finger at his father \"There is no way I am dealing with this right now. Dad, <em>please</em>.\" He said, tugging a hand through his hair. \"I don't have the time to kill anything, retrieve a godly weapon, rescue anybody - find someone else. Literally anyone. I'm begging you. \" He said and Poseidon rolled his eyes before sitting down in one of the empty plastic chairs. Percy stared. \"What are you doing?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Ask your sister.\" Poseidon told him and Percy opened and closed his mouth a few times before turning to see Estelle walking over with a few cans of coke.</p>\n<p>\"Oh good, they haven't started yet - hi Poseidon.\" She added as she handed out the drinks. Percy remained frozen. \"Annabeth just called and said she's going to be a few minutes late. We can film some of it though until she gets here.\" Estelle continued. Poseidon was a little worried they had broken his son. He cracked open his coke can and tried to figure out how mortals enjoyed such meager beverages.</p>\n<p>\"So...You haven't come to give me a quest?\" Percy said slowly. Poseidon shook his head. \"You didn't come to give Luke a quest, right?\" He frowned, eyes flicking to where his son was trying to tie his shoes with varying levels of success in the middle of the soccer field.</p>\n<p>\"He's three.\" Poseidon pointed out. Percy opened his mouth to respond, but at that moment the whistle blew - signifying the start to one of the most amusing things Poseidon had yet to witness...And he had seen some amusing things in his thousands of years. He had never had much interest in mortal sports - especially when the players were so young...But watching his grandson getting distracted by a butterfly and leaving behind the ball altogether was incredibly enjoyable. Watching Percy chase after him was even better.</p>\n<p>\"My lord,\" Annabeth said when she appeared a bit later. \"Whatever you need...It has to wait until <em>after</em> Luke goes to bed because if his sleep schedule is messed up than we <em>all</em> suffer and I am carrying another life inside of me and- <em>Percy.</em>\" She said, running a hand over her face to gesture at the god. Poseidon took another sip of coke. Really, he was kind of offended that they were so exasperated to see him. Most fell to their knees in awe. Kids these days. </p>\n<p>\"Oh, um. He's just here to watch Luke's soccer game.\" Percy said and Annabeth closed her eyes for a few moments. </p>\n<p>\"...He's what?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know, wise girl. I was hoping you knew.\" Percy said. Estelle scoffed at the conversation as Poseidon blinked - Annabeth's earlier words have just sunk in. </p>\n<p>\"You're with another child?\" He asked curiously. Both Percy and Annabeth looked him over warily before nodding. From over on the soccer field, Luke tripped over the ball. Annabeth's hand went to her stomach as if Poseidon might try to snatch the baby right out of her.</p>\n<p>\"I'm voting on the name Stella for a girl,\" Estelle said. Luke got back up and tripped again. \"Definitely not named after me...But also, definitely named after me.\" She shrugged. Poseidon hummed.</p>\n<p>\"Cora? Pearl? Amphitrite?\" He suggested and Percy's confusion at this entire situation seemed to subside into outrage as he made a choking noise.</p>\n<p>\"I am <em>not</em> naming my daughter after your wife.\" He said before a small smile tugged on his face. \"...Maybe Kym.\"</p>\n<p>\"After Kymopoleia?\" Annabeth asked, clapping as Luke kicked the ball into his own team's net. \"That's the sister that tried to kill you, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"I liked her.\" Percy said with a shrug \"We vibed a little.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey!\" Estelle scowled, waving a hand in front of her brother's face \"Why does the murderous sister get chosen over <em>me</em>?\" She demanded. Percy rose his hand in surrender. \"Ridiculous.\" Estelle said and turned to Poseidon \"He's ridiculous.\" She reiterated and slumped back into her chair. </p>\n<p>Three soccer games, four birthday parties, one ballet recital, and six first days at school later...Annabeth and Percy stopped questioning him whenever he showed up. On one occasion, they even let him babysit (after he went under oath to promise he wasn't about to curse their children or try to throw them into any quests). Percy even Iris messaged him once or twice to talk instead of his normal offerings.</p>\n<p>\"See?\" Estelle told him as she threw a seashell into the water \"That's what normal parents <em>do</em>.\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose I can see why humans find comfort in regular interactions. Even if the tasks are mundane.\" Poseidon said. She didn't seem surprised that he had appeared. Then again, nobody ever seemed surprised by him popping up anymore. The only person who ever still jumped when he walked in was Paul...And Poseidon was convinced that was because he was ready to rush Sally out of the room if she looked at the god too long. He supposed Paul would have done some googling on ancient mythology... It didn't always paint him in the best light.</p>\n<p>\"Annabeth and Percy have their anniversary tomorrow...Want to help me babysit?\" Estelle asked. From somewhere in Olympus, Poseidon could hear Zeus choking in indignation at the audacity to ask a\u00a0<em>god</em> such a question. Poseidon shrugged. Thunder cracked above them despite the day being clear and sunny. \"Awesome. I need your help too - Nico and Will are\u00a0<em>finally</em> getting married after the whole 'we don't think that piece of paper means anything' phase and I am going to get Hades and Apollo to attend even if it kills me.\" She said with a stoic nod. Poseidon was pretty sure Apollo was planning on going to the wedding anyways to perform a rendition of his favorite songs throughout the millennia...but the idea of seeing Hades awkwardly sitting at a wedding - or better yet\u00a0<em>walking his child down the aisle -</em> oh, he knew the chances were slim but....\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I will do what I can.\" He promised. And take every opportunity to remind his brother about it for the rest of eternity. He hoped Hades cried.</p>\n<p>\"Awesome,\" Estelle said and handed him a shell \"For your trouble.\"</p>\n<p>\"...You do realize seashells aren't actually offerings, right?\" He asked. He had thought somewhere along the way she would have realized...Apparently not. \"Usually it's food.\" He added. Estelle blinked.</p>\n<p>\"Oh gods,\" She muttered \"Athena is not going to be happy I've been burning books.\"</p>\n<p>Poseidon beamed. This human might not be so bad after all.</p>"
