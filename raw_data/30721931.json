  "text": "<p>Dream\u2019s favorite part was the adrenaline.</p>\n<p>It spread through his body in a red-hot wildfire, caught his veins all the way down to the tips of his fingers where they shook around the steering wheel. It made his breath ragged and audible above the rev of his engine, felt akin to the high he got on something else illegal\u2014but if he had to choose which one was better, it\u2019d be this. He\u2019d probably pick racing over anything.</p>\n<p>For Dream, it was the perfect way to settle disputes. A clear winner, a surefire end, something fair so long as their cars were both good enough. And Dream\u2019s cherry red supercar was always good enough to race\u2014with how much time he spent taking care of it, it was bound to be. It only ever came down to his opponent\u2019s ride. And theirs was usually good, too.</p>\n<p>Dream was rarely someone struck by road rage, rarely the idiot who caused an accident because he couldn\u2019t manage his temper and had to prove something to a stranger on the road. He preferred the races that were planned, the ones that gathered a crowd on the sides of the road all cheering for one or the other. The ones that were, as Dream liked, to settle disputes. When he\u2019d get a little too pissed at his friend and they\u2019d bet to race on it, to spend some extra time doting on their cars only to line up and do something dangerous.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was safer when it was planned. Still illegal, but safer. Even if it was only just a little.</p>\n<p>And Dream got in a lot of petty fights with his best friend Sapnap. A hot-headed raven with a fast car to call his own and hands that were itching to get on the wheel. He rivaled Dream in impulsiveness, rivaled Dream in that soul-binding feeling of getting in the driver\u2019s seat of a needlessly fast car and staring down that yellow line. They both lived for the thrill of it\u2014and for the past two-odd years since they\u2019d spent drowned in this illegal mess, it\u2019d become the only way they\u2019d manage to settle arguments.</p>\n<p>Like when the TV in their apartment fell off the wall in the dead of night and they raced to see who\u2019d pay for the replacement. Or when Sapnap accused Dream of stealing the money he kept under his mattress and Dream insisted that he didn\u2019t, and a stupid race felt like the only way to end their mutual silent treatment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or most notably, when Sapnap stole Dream\u2019s girlfriend and they raced each other for her. She\u2019d been half as crazy as they were, crazy enough to stand on the yellow line and wave the checkered flag. Crazy enough to even let two idiots speed their too-expensive cars down the road to see who\u2019d win her lips around their cock, crazy enough to spin around and watch them go.</p>\n<p>Sapnap won that race. Dream couldn\u2019t be mad about it.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, they were just bored. Bored enough to be idiots. It happened more often than either of them would care to admit, but slogs of nothing often got them both in the driver\u2019s seat of their supercars. Maybe those races were the most fun, because the burning hot adrenaline wasn\u2019t warring with reckless fury, and Dream could let it fill his body with unbridled want all on its own.</p>\n<p>Those were the races planned the most in advance\u2014because there wasn\u2019t a rage-sensitive time limit\u2014the ones that drew the biggest crowds of friends and randoms looking for something illegal and fast. The ones with the loudest engines and the most screaming, the ones where picking sides was a matter of favoritism and not whose part of the argument made the most objective sense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sapnap talked a lot about the flag girls for those races. Dream had never paid them much mind, so he let Sapnap pick who got to stand in the road and start their race. And he would\u2014wearing a self-assured grin and holding those checkered flags in the air, he\u2019d call on any pretty girl brave enough to take them from his hands.</p>\n<p>He was easily distracted by their presence. The girls in their tight clothes and the way they\u2019d twist their bodies to wave those flags like a starting gun, the way they\u2019d risk something in themselves to stand in between two cars planning to speed just for a fair start to it. Or just because they liked the attention; which if you asked Sapnap, was the more likely story. He was more than happy to give them attention.</p>\n<p>Dream wasn\u2019t nearly as distracted as his friend was. He always managed to keep his eyes facing front, only looking just enough to watch the wave of black-and-white checkers in the air. He\u2019d let Sapnap talk his ear off about how hot the flag girl had looked after every race, but he never found himself eager to be much of an active participant in those conversations.</p>\n<p>Not until it wasn\u2019t a girl.</p>\n<p>Before Sapnap had even gotten in the road with the flags, a pretty brunet in short shorts had taken them from his hands. And with a British accent doused in saccharine, he\u2019d whispered right in Sapnap\u2019s ear about how he <em> \u201chad this one.\u201d </em> It wasn\u2019t a question. He was waving the flags that time, and Sapnap didn\u2019t have it in him to make it an argument\u2014he just watched him take his stance.</p>\n<p>Dream was all adrenaline when he got behind his wheel. And the sun was too high for them to be doing something illegal, and the crowd around them was too big for it to go unnoticed. The whole thing was built on nothing but impulse, a cocky smirk from Sapnap before the sun rose when there was melon-flavored smoke hung in clouds between them. And Dream was never someone to turn down a race, so here he was. Foot hovering over the gas, teeth gritted in reckless wait.</p>\n<p>And his body ran hot the moment he caught sight of the flag girl. Flag <em> boy. </em></p>\n<p>He held those checkered flags like he owned the whole street, clad in tight red shorts that matched Dream\u2019s car just a little too well. Dream had never seen fishnets look so good on someone\u2019s legs before, but that boy\u2019s legs went on for <em> days. </em> And all that was before he even considered the cropped black jacket or the tiny little shirt to go beneath it.</p>\n<p>Dream had never been so tense in the driver\u2019s seat. And he\u2019d never made full eye contact with a flag girl before, never caught the gleam of mirth in anyone\u2019s gaze through his freshly cleaned windshield. He\u2019d never had them return his looks or cast him a playful wink with the over-exaggerated mouthing of <em> \u201cgood luck\u201d </em> through pretty pink lips.</p>\n<p>Maybe if Dream won, he\u2019d get that guy\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>He let himself catch on the way the brunet arched his back. On the way he rolled his shoulders, on the way the stretch of it made his already tiny shirt ride higher on his chest and expose even more of that pretty pale skin.</p>\n<p>Dream took a stuttered breath and brought his eyes back to the road. The flags fell, and his foot pushed down on the gas. He was gone.</p>\n<p>And for the first time, Dream shifted his gaze to his side mirror after speeding off. And he <em> looked </em> for that boy in the reflection, caught the way he jumped up excitedly and waved those flags around with his mouth dropped open in a cheer. Caught him break out into a run after the two speeding cars, followed closely by all the other bystanders that Dream couldn\u2019t bring himself to care about.</p>\n<p>He took a side glance at Sapnap\u2019s car beside him. It looked like nothing but a flash of orange wrap, but even still, Dream knew he was ahead. At some point, he\u2019d taken a commanding lead.</p>\n<p>And his lead managed to last. He hit their decided finish line first, hit the brakes on his car and came to a screeching halt, stumbled out onto the road in wind-blown victory. Sapnap was only a little bitter, but Dream was far too caught up in a pretty flag boy to pay his friend any mind. A pretty flag boy who seemed to be approaching him, still twirling the flags that gave him the name in his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream was still riding his own high when the brunet leaned against the side of his car, smiling with teeth through his pretty pink lips and rolling his eyes not-so-subtly over the whole of Dream\u2019s body. Dream ran fingers through his hair with a type of lax casual that made it seem like he wasn\u2019t paying the boy any mind, but that was the furthest thing from the truth. He was going insane, just silently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did good.\u201d <em> Oh god his accent. </em> \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you race that well before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream looked over to him, raising an eyebrow amidst his prideful grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to my races before?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy only shrugged, dragged a lone finger along a vein on Dream\u2019s arm until he hit the sleeve of his t-shirt. Dream hoped he didn\u2019t look too flustered, hoped the heat of his skin could be blamed on the burning sun and the adrenaline running flames through his body. He let himself watch the movement of the brunet\u2019s hand, paying threateningly close attention to the slimness of his wrist and the bright red lacquer that covered his nails.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His gaze fell to the red shorts that clung to the boy\u2019s legs, matching fishnets running up under the fabric. It was then that Dream noticed just <em> how </em> closely those shorts matched his car, the reds blending into each other in one smother of vicious cherry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream touched one of his fingers to the red on the brunet\u2019s thigh, letting his prideful gaze twist into something just a tad closer to scarlet arrogance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour shorts match my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy grinned. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dream smirked back, \u201cso it\u2019s intentional?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy shrugged, let Dream\u2019s hand slide up to cover his waist. And he took a daring step closer, planted his hand against the front of Dream\u2019s chest when they spun to face each other properly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he flicked his nails against Dream\u2019s chest, \u201cyour windshield\u2019s very clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Dream tugged him closer, \u201cI care a lot about my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>The brunet spread his palm flat against Dream\u2019s front, holding both the checkered flags down at his side in the other. And his pretty brown eyes fell to Dream\u2019s lips for a moment, staring through those too-long eyelashes when they slid up to meet his gaze again.</p>\n<p>There was something coy and playful in that stare. Dream let his grip tighten around the boy\u2019s waist, digging into the exposed skin of his middle as a pinky finger slid beneath the waistband of those damn red shorts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see you through it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dream laughed, soft and caught beneath his breath, \u201ccan you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he tapped the flags against Dream\u2019s leg, \u201cyou\u2019re very hot when you\u2019re focused,\u201d he slid his finger up to catch under Dream\u2019s jaw, \u201cand I can totally see you staring at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dream spoke with playful tease. \u201cYou gonna do something about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The brunet only shrugged. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream scoffed near-silently, glancing sideways over the roof of his car for a moment before he shoved their lips together. His advances were accepted without question, the sound of checkered flags hitting the road painfully obvious as the boy rose up on his toes. He took Dream\u2019s shoulders and tried to tug him down, his side hitting against the door of the hot car when Dream tilted his head to take it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Large hands pulled on a tiny waist. They slid downward to more unsavory places, slipped fingers beneath tight fabric and gripped with something best described as <em> claim. </em> Pink lips fell open on a gasp and Dream took it as an invitation, licked into the boy\u2019s mouth with the rush of something crimson shaded. His lips were soft, <em> so soft, </em> and he tasted of false sugar and roaring fantasies. He tasted just the way he looked. He tasted red and eye-catching.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream was poorly rendered melon flavor and the bite of nicotine. He was the chilled stain of menthol left behind on reckless lips, a mouth full of bad decisions and ivory teeth that dug with a desired firmness. And the brunet took every drop of trouble that oozed past Dream\u2019s pressing lips, split his own mouth open to welcome its taste.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a pathetically rude interruption when a fist slammed against the roof of Dream\u2019s car, the sound of it loud enough to jolt the pair away from each other and draw their open-mouth stares to its source. It was Sapnap, already retreating backward to his own car as he shouted across the road.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop making out with the flag boy and <em> go!\u201d </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he was climbing into the driver\u2019s seat before Dream could get a word in. It was then that the sharp blare of sirens found Dream\u2019s ears, and he was shoving at the brunet before he could even think about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in my car,\u201d he spoke with breathless intent, \u201cwe\u2019ve gotta run.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy gathered the abandoned checkered flags up off the road\u2014and <em> god </em> did he look good bending over\u2014and ran around the back of Dream\u2019s car to fall into the passenger seat. Dream was running on borrowed time, twisting his keys in the ignition while he closed his door and pressing his foot on the gas while the brunet shut his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was more than stupid to hang around a racing site after a race, but if Dream wasn\u2019t stupid then he wouldn\u2019t have even raced to begin with. And that was neglecting the fact that he <em> liked </em> this part of the deal\u2014another illegal excuse to drive too fast, the wash of blue and red lights and the unbearably loud ring, the familiar rush beneath his skin that left him clawing for more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And his mouth was still painted with invisible red, a strange tingle left behind against his lips that felt akin to a body-killing substance. Like something he could grow addicted to\u2014pins and needles pricking sensitive skin, washing his entire face hot with something undefinable, something made better by seatbelt-less speeding down an unfamiliar road.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow fast does this thing go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream cast his glance to the boy whom that voice belonged to, found his long fingers caught around the handle on the roof and his foot pushed on the dashboard for stability. His face would cover in blue before Dream found the sense to look back at the road, flick his eyes down to the speedometer in a moment of weakness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even still, he didn\u2019t give a proper answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFast enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>A laugh emitted from beside him, bright and lilted as if there was anything casual about this situation. Anything casual about high-speed chasing and feeling above the law, about reckless driving and a dangerous lack of safety precautions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a number?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream laughed in return. \u201cNumbers don\u2019t matter much, babe.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was something unspoken beneath the rose color to his tone, an implication of what could come if they ever outran the law. Dream flicked his eyes over to the brunet for another fleeting moment, finding the same shade of pink beneath his playful grin. He was alight with mirth, colored dangerous by shades of red and blue, still a vicious glow of <em> something </em> in all his too-tight clothes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs your car compensating for something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream laughed, drew his eyes back to the speedometer to watch the little red pointer slip ever-closer to the max. He took a sharp turn and watched Sapnap\u2019s car swerve in the opposite direction, splitting the cops behind them apart in a hopeless chase.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s heart was pounding in his ears. Every breath he took through grinning lips was shaking, every tick of laughter stuttered. He tightened his grip on the wheel to keep it steady, pretended he didn\u2019t notice the intent gaze the brunet had set on his fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He answered finally. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy beside him laughed quietly in response, though it was half-lost to the loud sirens from behind them. And when Dream glanced over at him <em> again, </em> he saw his free hand holding the armrest with a white-knuckled grip, every inch of him tight in an attempt to stay in place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream looked at the road. \u201cI never caught your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>The brunet laughed in hiding again. \u201cGeorge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, George.\u201d Dream shifted the placement of his hands. \u201cYou wanna see how fast this baby can go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll show me.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Dream floored it\u2014as if he wasn\u2019t flooring it already\u2014and sped even faster down the street. George yelped at the sudden increase in speed, both their heads colliding with the backs of their seats despite already resting there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream was all laughs and spiked adrenaline. George felt unfamiliar with this kind of high. The kind of high that was rushing, the kind that was tidal waves of fierce heat\u2014nearly unmanageable in its vicious presence, enough to make George feel as though he might break. Edged, edged, <em> edged </em> by death until there was nothing left but loud noise and faster cars.</p>\n<p>The whole point was to win the chase, and to win the chase they had to lose the cops on their tail. It became a too-fast game of tricky maneuvers, of spinning the steering wheel and endangering everyone within a mile\u2019s radius until Dream could get his speeding car out of range from those pretty red-blue lights. Turning, turning, turning again\u2014speeding into a dead empty alley and slamming the brakes before his car hit a wall.</p>\n<p>The sirens went rolling past them. They\u2019d won.</p>\n<p>Dream looked over at George, who\u2019d caught his roll forward with two hands on the dashboard. He returned Dream\u2019s watchful gaze with a wide-eyed stare of his own, chest heaving with exertion despite their lack of physical activity. Dream let his eyes roll over George\u2019s slim frame again, let his adrenaline-fueled body surge hotter with something needy, let his gaze linger on the exposed skin between locks of mesh tights for a moment too long.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should probably wait here for a bit.\u201d Dream spoke with a pathetic breathlessness that he wished to blame on nothing but high speeds, but he\u2019d never learned how to lie to himself. \u201cTo make sure we lost them for real.\u201d</p>\n<p>George swallowed thickly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy car,\u201d Dream took a breath, dropped his gaze onto George\u2019s parted lips, \u201cit\u2019s pretty hard to miss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should wait\u2014\u201d Dream spit out a quiet <em> \u201cyeah\u201d </em> in the midst of George\u2019s pause, \u201c\u2014just to be safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSafety,\u201d Dream nodded, \u201cis important.\u201d</p>\n<p>George hummed in agreement, leaning forward over the armrest to catch Dream\u2019s fatal lips with his again. And he\u2019d lost some of his cut melon to the feel of whatever it was that tasted like <em> Dream </em>\u2014the mild, unidentifiable flavor that couldn\u2019t be bottled or hardened into candy. There was still that edge of danger behind his ivory teeth, still the tang of nicotine when George caught his tongue against his own.</p>\n<p>Dream moved his lips with a scarlet intent, threaded fingers through dark hair and tugged George closer in his uncomfortable position. They both leaned against the armrests attached to their seats, letting the firm obstructions cut into their abdomens as they chased each other with high-speed intent. Dream managed to grab at exposed skin again, trail his fingers down George\u2019s side until he felt his body shiver, felt him push their locked lips firmer and throw away the key.</p>\n<p>Hands couldn\u2019t grab well enough, George couldn\u2019t get Dream any closer with tugs on his shirt, and no matter how much he sat up on his leg he couldn\u2019t press their bodies together. Their lips fell apart in a much-needed gasp, two mouths falling open to take in as much air as they could in a single second before they collapsed into each other again.</p>\n<p>George was so red so fucking <em> red, </em>brighter than Dream\u2019s car and starker than spilled blood. He was rose-colored whimpers into Dream\u2019s open mouth, chest falling forward in a way that forced his head to tilt upward and give Dream a better angle to spit danger past his lips. Their mouths slid together in something alight with need, something flaming at the meeting point and hotter than liquid metal.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s,\u201d George stole another kiss before Dream could finish, \u201cthere\u2019s no backseat to my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>George pulled him downward again, shoved their lips back together in something rough and sliding, felt the snag of Dream\u2019s teeth against his sensitive skin. Dream caught a hand around his jaw and pulled him forward, pressed his exposed stomach tighter against the armrest until it became more pain than discomfort, dug teeth into his bottom lip until George tugged away with a huff.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d he bit Dream\u2019s lip in retaliation, \u201cfuck you and your stupid car.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream laughed, flicking his tongue over George\u2019s parted lips. He dropped the hand from George\u2019s head to gesture vaguely at the seat he was sitting in, raising an eyebrow as if that would give George all the answers. It didn\u2019t. All it got Dream was an incredulous look through lust-darkened eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit on my lap.\u201d</p>\n<p>George grabbed Dream by the shoulders and pulled, another laugh spilling past the blond\u2019s lips. And they maneuvered themselves around\u2014with a lot of difficulty and climbing\u2014so Dream was sitting in the passenger seat with George straddling his hips. Dream threaded his fingers through the red of the fishnets, used his new angle to drag his lips up the column of George\u2019s throat. Sank his teeth into the pale skin just as he had done to pink lips, sucked it into his mouth in a hunger-driven chase for violet.</p>\n<p>Something about George called for Dream to mark him <em> his. </em> Something about his pretty face and the not enough clothing, something about the two checkered flags he\u2019d dropped on the floor of the car, something about his painfully silver tongue and the sharpest taste of red he\u2019d ever found. His pale, empty skin was the most tempting canvas when the brush was ruthless lips, when the paint was pink and purple and only semi-permanent.</p>\n<p>George bounced, <em> bounced </em> on Dream\u2019s lap when he trailed blossoms of amethyst down the side of his neck. And any stimulation was welcome stimulation, but fucking <em> bouncing </em> was certainly a step above that. Dream tried not to sound too pathetic when he groaned against George\u2019s skin, but even he had enough common sense with his lust-heavy brain to know he\u2019d failed terribly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hands caught on George\u2019s thighs dared to skate higher, trailing over his hips and up the exposed parts of his body. Dream paused the motion of his hands at the hem of George\u2019s shirt, caught only middle fingers beneath the fabric until a pale hand caught around his wrist and pulled him higher. Dream laughed light into George\u2019s neck, grinned ever-so-slightly against the violet-turning skin as pale fingers slid down his arm and to his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Dream pushed his hands up to drag thumbs over George\u2019s nipples. The chill of it was unmistakable, the responding mewl that rang out at such a light touch only a bonus.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dream pulled his lips away, \u201cis that what I think it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>George was practically pouting at him, drawing his fingers tighter in the fabric covering Dream\u2019s shoulders until it gathered beneath his palms. He took it upon himself to bounce again, to lean into the touch Dream had on his nipples and fall against his face with a sloppy excuse for a kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream pushed him back up to sit straight, rucked his shirt up to his collarbones to expose the metal in question. The cloth was tight enough to stay there even after Dream pulled his hands away, fabric catching on the top of his chest and leaving the glossy metal exposed. Two pretty barbells, silver and gleaming.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cOf course </em> you have nipple piercings,\u201d Dream huffed, flicking one of them for emphasis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>George whined, but he still managed to roll a smirk over his kiss-swollen lips. He put his hand on top of Dream\u2019s, urged him to press his palm harder against the piercing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d</p>\n<p>It came out shakier than he wanted it to, but every word was still edged with a playful carmine. Like he already knew the answer\u2014because he <em> did </em> know the answer. The groan Dream gave in answer was unnecessary evidence to something already known, fuel to something red and burning beneath their feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The car was still running. It emitted a low hum to back the heaving breaths between the both of them, a shadow of a reminder that they were still sitting in an alley, on top of each other in the passenger seat of a probably-wanted vehicle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>None of that mattered. \u201cYeah, I fucking like them.\u201d <em> That\u2019s </em> what mattered.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>George found it in him to nod in response, to twist his fingers tighter in the fabric on Dream\u2019s shoulders. He gripped the back of Dream\u2019s hand with a cutting hold, dug those red-coated nails into the skin beneath them until Dream was hissing through grit teeth. Hissing and leaning forward, laving his tongue over the nipple his hand wasn\u2019t covering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His skin tasted red, too. Tasted scarlet and sweat-salted against the flat of his tongue, gliding, <em> gliding </em> over the newly exposed skin and catching on the silver metal when he swirled his tongue. That was bitter metallic, sharp and biting enough to cut through the drip of red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Dream caught his teeth against the barbell, George mewled. Every tug on the shining metal was enough to pull a sound from the brunet, enough to make him writhe in Dream\u2019s lap and dig those pretty red nails harder into his skin. Dream managed to shift his nearly-bleeding hand enough to pinch George\u2019s nipple between two fingers, flicking his tongue over the spheres on the other barbell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slid his hand past the waistband of absurdly tight shorts just as George caught his fingers through blond hair, pulling his nails out of Dream\u2019s skin and leaving those pretty crescent-shaped marks. Dream used his newfound freedom to drag his thumb roughly over the piercing, shifting the metal beneath pale skin enough to make George whine. And he fell into Dream\u2019s advances, shoved one of his hands down between their bodies to palm hopelessly at his cock through his jeans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDream\u2014\u201d George stuttered when teeth caught on the skin around his piercing, \u201c\u2014I want\u2014\u201d gasped when Dream gripped onto his ass, \u201c\u2014want to suck,\u201d Dream tugged on both piercings, \u201csuck you off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream only laughed, the sound isolated in his throat as he caught his tongue around a silver barbell. He pulled off with a sickening <em> pop </em> in delicious suction, grinned up at George with spit-slick lips and tried not to groan when the brunet grabbed his cock roughly. He twisted the piercing in his hand to sit vertical, watched George\u2019s face twist and mouth drop open on a stuttered breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour nipples are sensitive.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was low and whispering, pressed in cooling breath right against George\u2019s wet piercing. It was barely enough stimulation to roll a shiver up his spine, to make his breath stutter and the hand in Dream\u2019s hair pull tighter. He leaned forward and gave a desirable amount of pressure to Dream\u2019s aching cock, a groan falling past his lips before he had the chance to stifle it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d George answered. \u201cNow let me suck your cock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod,\u201d Dream tugged on the piercing, \u201cyou really want that, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>George whined. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream flicked the barbell between his fingers hard enough for his nails to click, dragged his tongue up the side of George\u2019s neck in a wet stripe. He placed a gentle kiss on top of a too-dark hickey, the hand in his hair growing impatient with frantic tugging.\u00a0</p>\n<p>George tried to bounce again, shifted his hand up to Dream\u2019s abdomen so he could roll his hips down against his cock. Dream pulled his hand out of George\u2019s shorts, slapping his ass harshly in retaliation. George mewled at the contact, tugged on Dream\u2019s hair hard enough for his head to knock against the headrest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dream stuttered over his next breath, \u201cget on your knees.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was no hesitation in George\u2019s swift movement, barely even a pause between Dream\u2019s commanding sentence and his collapse onto the floor. He slid himself off of Dream\u2019s lap and onto the floor between his legs, caught halfway under the dashboard and batting his eyelashes up at Dream like that position was <em> comfortable. </em></p>\n<p>Maybe it was. Dream wouldn\u2019t put it past George and his skin-tight shorts, nor would he put it past those pretty pierced nipples. Pierced nipples that he could still see, on full display beneath the shirt still caught beneath his collarbones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>George was already letting his hands wander, tugging at Dream\u2019s belt and waistband in the midst of pushing at the hem of his shirt. Dream finally relented and stripped his torso bare, cast the fabric to the side so it landed somewhere in the driver\u2019s seat. And George had moved his fingers well enough to unbuckle Dream\u2019s belt, well enough to unfasten his jeans properly and shove impatient hands into his boxers.</p>\n<p>Dream resisted the urge to make a comment about it, instead lifting his hips up off the seat enough for George to get his cock out. He looked way too pretty on his knees between Dream\u2019s thighs, fluttering his too-long lashes over those darkened eyes and licking his pink lips wet. His gaze was lidded, a stare in a matching shade of red to the lacquer on his nails. Nails that looked so devilishly pretty when pale hands slid against Dream\u2019s cock with deliberate slowness, letting Dream feel the curve of his palm against him and the softness of long fingers.</p>\n<p>And there were still two checkered flags spread across the floor by George\u2019s legs, a black-and-white reminder of exactly what had brought them into this position to begin with. A reminder seldom needed when the car they were stuck in was so hidden from street view, the only light being that of the sun and the faint echo of dingy street lights.</p>\n<p>Dream was moments away from a demand to <em> get on with it </em> when George slid his tongue across the head of his cock. Lapped up any precum that had slid out, rolled his tongue over his upper lip before repeating the motion\u2014the same exact thing, only slower on the second time. Dream let his breath shake on the exhale, met George\u2019s eyes in something shaded cardinal, felt the brightly hued threads where they hung heavy in the air.</p>\n<p>George swirled his tongue, dipped his head just low enough to catch Dream past his lips. His pretty, <em> pink </em>lips\u2014fuck, did he have the lips for this\u2014still half-swollen on biting kisses and looking all too pretty to not be messed up more. And he kept them tight when he slid down around Dream\u2019s cock, sucked more of him into that slick mouth and dragged his hand up to meet on the downstroke.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cGod.\u201d </em> Dream caught his hands in George\u2019s dark hair, urging him to drag his lips lower until he hit the back of his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking pretty like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>George keened in response. He fluttered his eyes shut with contentment, slid his hand down to rest against Dream\u2019s thigh to take the rest of him. His eyes slid open in a thin line of dark against white, his lips dragging upward with a tongue pressed firm against the underside of his cock. Dragging up along a pulsing vein, leaving Dream nothing short of shuddering but still in a pathetic need for <em> more. </em></p>\n<p>He was going so slow. So pathetically <em> slow, </em> unfortunately deliberate in a way that Dream could barely fathom. Like he wanted this to be the slowest blowjob imaginable, like he wanted to sit on his spread knees on the floor of Dream\u2019s too-expensive car for as long as possible. He even went as far as to pull off completely, placing one of his hands back on Dream\u2019s cock to roll a thumb over the slit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He blinked up at Dream with startling innocence, an innocence that felt unearned when he was teasing Dream\u2019s cock like that. Unearned when his lips were already dripping, when his eyes were hazy behind the act and screaming out to be seen in scarlet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted this so bad,\u201d Dream gripped onto George\u2019s cheek, pressed a thumb against his lower lip to pry his mouth open, \u201cfucking take it, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>He spit into George\u2019s open mouth, feeling the way the hand on his cock tightened absentmindedly when George whined high and in his throat. He closed his mouth and swallowed like he meant it, parted his lips on a sputtering breath that sounded slick with all the rest of it. He nodded carefully, almost miniscule enough for Dream to miss the motion entirely.</p>\n<p>It came much quicker, then. The slide of swelling lips around Dream\u2019s cock, a hand sliding downward to catch around Dream\u2019s thigh again. And he kept his mouth insatiably tight, kept his eyes shut as he moved his head in a quicker but still deliberate motion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The obscenity of it was impenetrably crimson. The slick noises that filled the space of Dream\u2019s car, the thumb still pushed against the stretched corner of his lips. Spit gathered against Dream\u2019s finger as he kept it there, sliding against his thumb as more of it collected. Red nails dug into the fabric of Dream\u2019s jeans, attempted to claw their way into them despite the unhidden cock already lodged down George\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>It was like he wanted more. Selfishly, George wanted more. And he\u2019d hoped that the flutter of his eyelashes over scarlet-tinted eyes could say that for him, but Dream was still sitting there with no movement other than running hands. Other than fingers threaded through dark hair, other than the slide of a slick thumb against his cheek. George mewled, tugging off despite the hold Dream had on him, clearing his throat and letting the spit slide down his chin in thick ropes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2014\u201d George sputtered, wiping spit off his lips with the back of his hand, \u201c\u2014you can use me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream huffed out a laugh through smirking lips, shifted his hands so they both rested in the tangle of George\u2019s hair. And he tipped his head back carefully, watched his pretty purpled neck crane upward at the stretch, pink lips falling open with a heaving breath. Dream sat up better so he could lean over George\u2019s head, stare down into his dark eyes with a gaze strung taut with mirth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d His lips curled with daunting vex. \u201cI can use you?\u201d</p>\n<p>George tried his best to nod, but the motion was pathetically invisible through his arched neck. He settled on a hopeless-sounding <em> \u201cplease,\u201d </em> caught both by the angle of his head and the submission in his voice.</p>\n<p>Dream let himself laugh again, spit into the part of George\u2019s lips again and watched it fall against his mouth in a half-miss. But George was quick to flick his tongue out and lick it up, catching every last drop of it like he wanted it more than anything. And Dream leaned back against the carseat again, pulled George\u2019s head down with him so those open lips caught around the head of his cock again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t go easy on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s responding whine was in agreement, and Dream could tell through the noise. He pulled George\u2019s head down with a harsh force, dragged him with enough speed to make him gag and mewl, enough to make his eyes screw shut and his nails dig into Dream\u2019s clothed thighs again. Dream grit his teeth when he pushed George up, found it better to hold his head still and in the air while he moved his hips up off the seat to push further into his open mouth.</p>\n<p>George slid his hands up slightly to dig into the exposed skin above Dream\u2019s waistband, to claw crescent-shaped marks to replace the ones that had faded from his hands. The sting of it made Dream groan, made him tighten his hold on George\u2019s head and slam his head down to take his cock to the hilt.</p>\n<p>He gagged again. It sent his nails digging harder into Dream\u2019s skin, carmine nails carving marks into tan skin. George let his head fall sideways despite Dream\u2019s hold, shifting his tongue to lay over the side of Dream\u2019s cock when his head was tugged upward. He tipped his head to keep his top teeth to himself, slid his eyes open just enough to catch Dream\u2019s red face above him, parted lips panting over a groan.</p>\n<p>He brought George\u2019s head down with greater harshness, pressed his thumbs against the corners of his lips and tried to pull them wider. George mewled at the stretch, eyes shuddering up into the back of his head when Dream only pulled him harder, tried to edge the tip of his thumb into George\u2019s wide-open mouth just to see how much he could take.</p>\n<p>A lot, as it turns out. George could take a lot.</p>\n<p>And Dream let him tug off with a sinful <em> pop </em> so he could catch a breath, let his own hands fall against his thighs as George\u2019s slid away. He watched the boy with intent, watched him shift on his knees as if seeking comfort, watched him wipe at the spit gathering on his chin and gasp over his breaths. He looked up at Dream with his red-threaded gaze, pupils blown out into pools that swallowed umber near-completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cDream,\u201d his voice was obscenely spent, \u201cplease.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream drew one of his hands out and off his thigh, caught fingers beneath George\u2019s jaw and tugged him closer with the touch. It tipped his head back, pulled purple-stained skin taut at the edges and tempting enough for Dream to slide his fingers over it. One of George\u2019s hands fell away from his face, pale fingers catching around the metal of a piercing in a desperate search for stimulation.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d Dream teased, inching one of his feet over to sit between George\u2019s legs. \u201cWhat do you want, pretty?\u201d</p>\n<p>George mewled, watching with unmistakable interest as Dream\u2019s free hand caught around the base of his cock. His eyes practically went cross trying to look at everything in front of him, so Dream tugged his head closer\u2014close enough for his lips to hit against the head of his cock, close enough for his mouth to drop open absentmindedly, close enough for Dream to tap his cock against George\u2019s lolled out tongue twice with a lewd <em> slap. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dream prodded, sliding his thumb up George\u2019s chin to pull his bottom lip downward. \u201cI need you to use your words.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust want\u2014\u201d George gasped when Dream\u2019s foot pressed against his cock, \u201c\u2014your cock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have my cock,\u201d Dream taunted, pressing it between George\u2019s lips. \u201cJust keep sucking, baby, I\u2019ll get you off after.\u201d</p>\n<p>That seemed to spur George on, compelled him to shove all of Dream\u2019s cock down his throat in one go. Dream groaned in response, dug the tips of his fingers into the skin of George\u2019s jaw hard enough to leave a blossoming mark. And he let George have at him again, let him pick the speed\u2014he chose fast\u2014and how much he wanted to take\u2014and he chose <em> all of it. </em> It was nearly the same as it had been before, only this time, George was in control.</p>\n<p>Dream let his large hands frame George\u2019s pretty face, let the tan of his fingers sit stark in comparison to those blushing cheeks. A shade of pink that let his freckles show more clearly, let his arousal be visible even without Dream\u2019s foot pressed against his throbbing cock. And there was still a hand toying with the metal on his nipple, pulling on the barbell hard enough for George to mewl around Dream\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>He was getting close, close enough for his head to fall back against the seat and leave him looking down at George with a sliver of a gaze. The look he gave surged hot and carmine through George\u2019s veins, erred him to suck harder and faster as if he could pull the orgasm out of Dream.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he could. Could moan around Dream\u2019s cock loud enough, could lift his hips up into the barely-there pressure from his foot, could tug on his own piercing hard enough to look pretty and garnet in his spot on his knees, pretty enough for Dream to pull his hair a little too hard and spill down his throat with a drawn-out moan.</p>\n<p>George slid his mouth up to catch as much of Dream in his mouth as he could, let him spill over his lips and tongue and all of it. When George pulled his mouth away with finality, he rolled his tongue over stained lips with a coy look in his eyes. Let his entire face beam with sick red, his thumb rolling over his chin while the other hand still tugged at his piercing.</p>\n<p>Dream groaned, pulled on George\u2019s hair as if beckoning him upward, pleased to find that George got the hint and began to climb into Dream\u2019s lap with his shaking knees. Dream caught him by the shoulders the moment he could, pulled him down and against his body the moment he could. Both of George\u2019s hands fell away from himself and caught on Dream\u2019s bare shoulders, red nails already dragging over the freckle-scattered skin with intent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at that,\u201d Dream said quietly, one of his hands already moving to get George\u2019s cock out of his shorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d His voice was so beautifully spent. \u201cThen we should do it again sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream laughed, rolling his thumb over the head of George\u2019s cock. \u201cWe can talk about next time,\u201d he spit in the palm of his hand,<em> \u201cafter </em> I get you off.\u201d</p>\n<p>George hummed in response, dropping his head against Dream\u2019s shoulder and pressing swollen lips against his neck. Dream focused all his attention on George\u2019s desperate cock, already dripping precum against his finger and looking painfully hard in his hand. He let his free hand catch on the piercing George had been toying with earlier, the metal already warm beneath his touch before he even laid a finger on it.</p>\n<p>George mewled at the touch, arched his back and pressed his cock further into Dream\u2019s hand. Dream slid his hand down and back up again, kept the motion of his wrist quick and repeated and let his thumb pass over the head on the upstroke. He twisted the piercing between his fingers, savored the whines that fell right into his ear and the slickness of lips against the skin of his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d already been right on the edge, so it didn\u2019t take much stimulation from either of Dream\u2019s hands for George to be spilling all over his palm. Coating the skin of his fingers sticky white, leaving Dream to tug his hand away but keeping the metal of George\u2019s piercing pressed tight between his fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lifted his hand up between them, George feeling compelled to lift his head up and find Dream\u2019s panting lips. Dream held his hand up to George\u2019s mouth, gave him a look that could only be described as <em> dangerous, </em> the entire situation telling George to do nothing but loll his tongue out and like Dream\u2019s hand clean.</p>\n<p>Before he could swallow, Dream caught his lips in a kiss\u2014laved his tongue across his lips and into his mouth to taste every last bit of George that had been left there. And he kept his fingers toying with that piercing, the feeling of it just enough to make George whimper pathetically into his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They pulled away with a slick string of spit caught between their lips, breaking within moments to fall against George\u2019s chin. He took a gasping breath and looked at Dream with an edge of scarlet, his eyes begging to know when there\u2019d be more. Dream let his gaze fall to the checkered flags laid on the floor of his car for a moment, his eyes finding George again before he could be away for long.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou coming to my next race?\u201d</p>\n<p>George nodded slowly, his eyes everywhere on Dream that he could see. He tried his best to smirk with slick lips, tried to look composed over his clearly fucked-out features and perhaps failing miserably.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you let me start again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream looked toward the driver\u2019s side window. His still-running car and the setting sun left him with a clamoring thought: he was so fucking screwed.</p>\n<p>\n<em> The next race. </em>\n</p>\n<p>When was the next race?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sapnap and Dream hadn\u2019t quarreled over much of anything lately. Yeah, there was the occasional bickering over stupid shit like who out of the two was supposed to get the groceries that week (surprise; it was Sapnap). Or who was supposed to pick up the mail from the post office (Dream made an excuse about being too busy to go, though he\u2019s always had a very open schedule). Or what they were going to have for dinner (Dream wanted lamb, Sapnap wanted hamburgers. They ended up getting sushi instead). However, none of it was worth racing over, and quite frankly, it was pissing Dream off.</p>\n<p>George had been on Dream\u2019s mind almost every single day since the last race. It was odd, because that was their one and only encounter so far, yet the brunet already had Dream wrapped around his delicate little finger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream wanted nothing more than to see the pretty brunet clad in red again, sporting <em> his </em>colors. His short-shorts, maybe even a cute little crimson crop top, and his pristine red nails. Waving his checkered flag high in the air, back arching slightly as he lifted himself onto his toes, and eyes shining with excitement and something else\u2014something Dream wanted to see up close and personal again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, of course, as all things do, nothing was going Dream\u2019s way.</p>\n<p>Sapnap had yet to call a race for anything, really. Whether it was just for the sake of it, or because of some petty argument. And at the moment, it seemed like Sapnap had...other things on his mind.</p>\n<p>Dream watched from their L-Shaped couch in the living room as Sapnap dragged in his third girl of the week\u2014and it was only Tuesday. Dream rolled his eyes, forcing his line of view to stay level with the television in front of him as Sapnap and the random girl shoved their tongues down each other\u2019s throats, blindly backing down the hall toward Sapnap\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>The door slammed shut, followed by another loud noise that was a mix between a gasp and a moan. When Sapnap and Dream first moved into their current place, Dream had learned very quickly that their shared apartment had thin walls. <em> Very </em>thin walls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Irritation and disappointment welled in Dream\u2019s gut. Irritation because, well, he was fucking tired, and now he would have to listen to the pair go at it for the next hour and a half. And disappointment because <em> fuck, </em>he missed George.</p>\n<p>He missed\u2014no, he <em> craved </em>the artificial sugar taste of George\u2019s lips on his. He wanted to feel the way George\u2019s hips felt under his strong calloused hands again. He wanted to toy with the boy\u2019s sensitive nipples, run his thumb roughly over the cold ball of his piercing and leave him squirming, whimpering for more. Dream\u2019s eyelids shut as he let out a shuddering breath, images of George in the front seat of his car, between his legs on the floor of his car, and on his lap all dancing around in his mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream sighed, blinking blankly up to the ceiling. He could feel himself beginning to strain painfully against the fabric of his jeans, which he still had yet to change. The sound of Sapnap and his one night stand was starting to get unbearably loud. Dream pushed himself up and off the couch and grabbed his car keys off the end table beside the couch. He beelined for the front door, not giving a shit about the loud slam as he shut the door behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cold night air nipped unapologetically against his freckled cheeks. Dream hurried down the concrete steps, turning sharply on his heel as soon as his feet met the ground in the direction of his beautiful, shiny red sports car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He unlocked his car and plopped into the front seat, hastefully reaching down to unbutton his jeans. A breath left his slightly parted lips as the pressure around his erection loosened. Without dwelling on it too much, Dream slid his left hand under his waistband, gritting his teeth as he imagined not his own large, unsteady hand\u2014but instead George\u2019s heavenly ones, twisting with such intricacy and skill, moving in all the right ways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cFuck.\u201d </em>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream watched from the corner of his eye as the girl struggled to hold her belongings in her arms, quietly excusing herself. The front door closed slowly, barely making a sound as it clicked shut, leaving Sapnap and Dream alone to their own devices in the kitchen. Dream tapped his spoon against the rim of his bowl, his Reese\u2019s Puffs cereal no longer looking as appetizing as it once had.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, <em> she\u2019s </em>definitely coming back,\u201d Sapnap grinned loopily, eyes staring off as he leaned his elbows onto the countertop behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad to hear,\u201d Dream grumbled sarcastically, dropping the spoon from his grip. He sighed, pushing back on the counter as he kicked his heel against the barstool he sat on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, you\u2019re really missing out with all these girls, Dream,\u201d Sapnap\u2019s head tipped back, eyes sliding shut as he bit his lip. Dream narrowed his eyes in disgust, visible disapproval for Sapnap\u2019s hormonal mindset. Though, was he really one to talk?</p>\n<p>\u201cSap, mind out of the gutter,\u201d Dream snapped his fingers teasingly, a breathy laugh leaving his nostrils. Sapnap chuckled lightly, head lolling to rest against his shoulder as he studied Dream\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dream frowned, nails scraping against the edge of the countertop. The tile felt cold against the tips of his fingers. Sapnap\u2019s lips parted, eyes squinting while he examined Dream\u2019s facial features.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sapnap didn\u2019t speak for a while. What was he staring for, anyway? Dream didn\u2019t break eye contact, only shifting uncomfortably under the raven\u2019s gaze. Dream noticed the dark marks on Sapnap\u2019s neck, as well as fading bite marks. Surely they didn\u2019t go at it <em> again </em>while Dream was asleep?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of judgemental silence, Sapnap spoke. \u201cSo,\u201d he drawled, eyes beaming with something dangerously akin to troublesome. \u201cWho was the flag boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s eyes widened, newfound attention directed solely at Sapnap at the mention of the brunet. He couldn\u2019t find it in him to smile, not when Sapnap had such a mischievous look on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge,\u201d Dream\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, eyes narrowing a little. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s hot,\u201d Sapnap said bluntly, a smirk tugging at his lips at the way Dream visibly tensed. A flame ignited in Dream, one that was ugly and possessive. Did Sapnap just say George was <em> hot? </em> It was one thing to say George was hot, but it was another to say that with such a lustful look in his eyes, like he <em> wanted </em>George. Sapnap decided he wanted to prod the fire in Dream\u2019s gut further,\u00a0 \u201cI think he\u2019d enjoy a night with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet you couldn\u2019t please him if you tried,\u201d Dream huffed, his hand gripping the edge of the countertop until his knuckles turned white. \u201cWhy\u2014why is this even a conversation we\u2019re having?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sapnap laughed heartily, the sound rubbing Dream in the wrong way. Sapnap had been wanting trouble when Dream last had a girlfriend, and he was definitely looking for trouble now that he saw the blond had his eyes set on someone. Dare Dream be the one to say it, but his own best friend could be straight up toxic at times.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, just interested in seeing if he\u2019s a good quick fuck or not,\u201d Sapnap mumbled, pushing off the counter so he could walk over to the fridge. Dream\u2019s blood boiled under his skin, veins burning red hot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s eye twitched as he opened his mouth to tell Sapnap to \u201cfuck off,\u201d but was stopped by Sapnap\u2019s overly cocky voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like he\u2019d be easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, what the fuck.</p>\n<p>Dream had Sapnap pushed against the wall in the blink of an eye, his shirt collar bunched up under Dream\u2019s fist. Sapnap\u2019s facial expression stayed neutral, but Dream could see right through his little disguise. He could see the way one of his hands shakily made their way up to Dream\u2019s, fingers firmly grasping his wrist. He could see the way his Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed nervously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit the fucking act, Sapnap,\u201d Dream growled, venom dripping from his words. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho said it was an act? Let a man be curious, and let a man test out his theory,\u201d The raven shrugged nonchalantly, breath hitching as Dream pushed against him more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna test out shit, fucking dickhead,\u201d Dream eyed Sapnap\u2019s wide ones, wanting nothing more than to wipe the smug grin off his face with a quick fist to his jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sapnap ran his tongue over his teeth, \u201ca race could settle this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream scoffed, his anger overriding his excitement for another race. Another race meant he got to see George, which was good. However, Dream wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to see George under the circumstances Sapnap was setting up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoever wins gets a shot at George.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if I haven\u2019t already had one,\u201d Dream snarled, shoving the hand with Sapnap\u2019s shirt collar back. \u201cAnd George isn\u2019t some prize to be won.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had no problem doing a race for your ex-girlfriend,\u201d Sapnap frowned, irritation lacing his tone. Dream rolled his eyes and stepped back, hesitantly letting go of the raven man\u2019s t-shirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was into that. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Dream said and crossed his arms, puffing out his chest slightly. \u201cWho said George was okay with this type of shit? He\u2019s just the flag boy for us.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty boy with sass written all over his face, Dream,\u201d Sapnap deadpanned. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll love the drama.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream didn\u2019t say anything. He only continued glaring at the raven in front of him, the anger still churning wildly in him. He didn\u2019t appreciate the way Sapnap was talking about George. Not in the slightest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream opened his mouth, preparing to cuss Sapnap out because he fucking deserved it. He deserved every word that was building on Dream\u2019s tongue, as the blond readied himself to lash out with a metaphorical knife. But he was rudely interrupted yet again, by Sapnap and his arrogantly confident words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRace on Friday at noon. Either you\u2019re there, or you\u2019re not. And if you\u2019re not,\u201d Sapnap tilted his head away, keeping his eyes trained on Dream\u2019s and watching with amusement as furious flames danced in his pupils. \u201cI guess George and I will be having a little fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you little shit\u2014\u201c Dream shouted and reached his hand out to grab onto Sapnap, missing by only a hair\u2019s length as the raven cackled and sped out of the kitchen, heading straight to his room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking asshole,\u201d Dream grumbled, clenching his fists at his sides, nails digging crescent shaped holes into his palms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream would get back at him, and he would definitely be winning the race, that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hot rays of sunshine shone down on the Earth, cursing Dream\u2019s bare arms with a light pink tint. Sweat that had built on his brows was wiped away with ease using the back of his hand as the other held a wet wash mitt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His overly expensive, beautiful, stunning red sports car sat, all soaped up, under the harsh sun. Dream\u2019s chest swelled as he gave it a once over\u2014the red body, dripping with pink and blue bubbles onto the asphalt below, the black rims on his tires sparkling to exhibit their cleanliness, the scorching sun reflecting off the near-black tinted windows. Dream bit his lip to suppress a grin because, fuck, his car was sexy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His thoughts were disrupted by a gentle hand finding its way to his shoulder, fingertips digging into his skin. Dream glanced down, grin growing as his emerald eyes caught glimmering amber ones. George stared up at him with a flirtatious smirk, the stick of a lollipop poking out at the corner of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, a race for me, huh?\u201d George teased as he subconsciously leaned into Dream\u2019s side, eyes unabashedly taking in every inch of Dream\u2019s appearance that he could. Dream chuckled lowly, hand moving to snake around George\u2019s waist and grasp his ass\u2014a different, yet similar pair of red booty shorts hugging his curves perfectly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Dream murmured, raking his eyes over George\u2019s face. His cheeks were a light pink, freckled with brown specks, prominent cheekbones highlighted with an iridescent shimmer. His lips\u2014those perfect, addicting lips that had Dream up at ungodly hours for a week and a half straight\u2014had a strong red lipstick expertly applied to them, accentuating his cupid\u2019s bow. A sheer red eyeshadow was blended onto his eyelids, making a self satisfied smirk rise on Dream\u2019s already self absorbed face. \u201cRed for me, baby?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d George said coolly, fluttering his lashes innocently as he wrapped his dainty fingers around the stick, opening his mouth to swirl the red lollipop onto his stained tongue. Dream felt a laugh rumble in his chest as he gave a quick slap to George\u2019s ass before pulling away.</p>\n<p>Dream peeled the mitt off his hand, tossing it to where Sapnap and a few others were washing their own cars just a few feet from the pair. Sapnap tossed Dream a fierce and determined glare, one that was easily reciprocated by the blond. The raven turned away with an inaudible huff, facing one of his racing friends that he was talking to just moments before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you agreed to this?\u201d Dream asked once he looked back to the brunet. The messy brown locks on top of his head were ruffled by the brisk gust of wind, mocha eyes squinted against the unrelenting sun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d George shrugged, observing with a hand on his hip as Dream began rinsing his car off, the water washing the bubbly soap away with ease. \u201cSeemed fun to watch you two idiots go at it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Dream hummed, raising one of his eyebrows. He watched the liquid soap drip down the side of his car and onto the pavement, revealing the shiny red wrap of his car. George scoffed playfully from beside him as he skimmed over Dream\u2019s dripping wet car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019d fuck your car if you had the chance, huh,\u201d George muttered, half-jokingly. Dream shot him a lighthearted glance while spraying the rest of his car off, being nitpicky as to get each soap bubble off of his car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Dream teased, wiggling his eyebrows. George shook his head with feigned annoyance. His lips rested in a gentle smile, tongue sticking out in the slightest between his pearly teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream turned off the water after he was sure his car was now spotless\u2014leaving just a soaking wet car that needed to be dried off. George whistled as he walked around the car slowly, eyes catching Dream\u2019s once he was opposite of him. The blond\u2019s breath hitched at the seductive smirk on George\u2019s face, one brow raised suggestively.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDream,\u201d George puckered his lips, slender digits swiveling the white stick. His lips sucked perfectly around the dwindling piece of candy as he winked, knowing <em> exactly </em> what he was doing to Dream. Arousal churned in Dream\u2019s groin as George laughed lowly, pulling the lollipop out with a lewd <em> pop </em>! \u201cYou\u2019d rather fuck the car?\u201d George said, pushing his bottom lip out into a pout, tongue pushing out to kitten lick the sugary sweet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorgie,\u201d Dream groaned, taking long strides to round the car and press against the brunet. George blinked sweetly, not hesitating to push up onto his toes and capture Dream\u2019s lips with his. The lollipop slipped from George\u2019s fingers, falling to the ground, now long forgotten as George\u2019s attention shifted to the intoxicating feeling of Dream\u2019s lips on his.</p>\n<p>Dream immediately melted into the kiss, eyes fluttering shut as his hands cupped George\u2019s face. George tasted like everything red\u2014luscious cherries, perfectly ripe strawberries, even tropical raspberries. Dream was only pulled in more and more, wanting to taste the most of George that he could.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His tongue slid against the waxy coating on George\u2019s bottom lip, already feeling the oddly sweet lipstick rub off on his own. Dream felt a <em> little </em>bad for ruining George\u2019s perfectly done lipstick, but honestly, he probably looked hotter with it all smudged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just as Dream was going to lick into George\u2019s mouth, a rough hand clapped him on the back, causing a noise of irritation and confusion to be ripped from the blond\u2019s mouth. He pulled away from the brunet, who shamelessly chased after his lips with an upset whine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, lovebirds, we haven\u2019t even <em> raced </em>yet,\u201d Sapnap tutted, cracking his knuckles, probably loudly enough to alert people from over a mile away. An exaggeration of course, because if it had been that audible, Dream might have offered a quick trip to the hospital before their race.</p>\n<p>George crossed his arms and rolled his eyes, glancing down to the now ruined and ant infested lollipop, grimacing. Dream\u2019s hand on George\u2019s face slid down to his shoulder, fingertips pressing into his skin, almost possessively.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost noon, huh?\u201d Dream said indifferently, as if he wasn\u2019t just interrupted in the midst of kissing the most gorgeous boy he had ever laid eyes on. Sapnap gave him a look before nodding.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to beat your ass and score it with this one,\u201d Sapnap clicked his tongue and winked to George, who only blinked in return. A lackluster response, one that made Dream grin in admiration and pride.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dream smiled softly at George, eyes following the way his thumb swiped under his bottom lip to flawlessly remove the red smudge. Dream\u2019s teeth grazed the corner of his bottom lip as he looked back up to George\u2019s eyes, taking in the anticipation and excitement in them. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get ready, flag boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He leaned down to George\u2019s ear, breath fanning hotly against his reddening cheeks, \u201cRace is gonna start soon,\u201d Dream murmured, \u201cand when I win, I\u2019m gonna have my way with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s heart pounded against his sternum, pulsing hard enough he could feel it in his ears. His hands gripped his smooth leather steering wheel tightly, knuckles paling from his hold. Sweat that had been building up from standing for hours in the sun slipped down his temple. His car engine rumbled continuously, the low hum bringing comfort to his tense muscles. Dream\u2019s foot was pressed down on the brake, reading to pounce on the gas as soon as George\u2019s little flag signalled the start of the race.</p>\n<p>Dream spared a glance to Sapnap\u2019s burnt orange car, blacked out windows rolled up so his face wasn\u2019t visible to the blond. His teeth tugged at his lower lip, eyes flickering to his driver\u2019s side mirror. George was already looking at Dream, an amorous glint in his amber eyes. Dream beamed, eyes following the flag in his hands as he raised it up high. George delivered one last wink before bringing it down swiftly, and Dream was gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His tires screeched on the pavement, quickly picking up speed as his foot shoved the gas pedal to the floor. Sapnap\u2019s car was riding dangerously close to his, slowly losing speed as Dream\u2019s car backfire sounded, the lever on the speedometer pushing past the <em> 200 mph </em>marker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream spared a glance at his rear view mirror, watching with bemusement as George jumped around excitedly with all of the other people in their rather large audience. Dream chuckled to himself, feeling breathless as his car pushed and pushed. Dream couldn\u2019t help but eye the way George\u2019s cute little crop top rode up with his raised arms, exposing the bottoms of the barbells on his nipple piercings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He let his free hand catch on the piercing George had been toying with earlier, the metal already warm beneath his touch before he even laid a finger on it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Images of the first and last time George had been alone with Dream flashed through his head as Sapnap\u2019s orange car inched forward. That won\u2019t do. Not when Dream was getting extremely turned on thinking of the things he would do to George once the race was over, once <em> Dream </em>won the race.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He looked way too pretty on his knees between Dream\u2019s thighs, fluttering his too-long lashes over those darkened eyes and licking his pink lips wet. His gaze was lidded, a stare in a matching shade of red to the lacquer on his nails.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dream growled under his breath, eyes flickering from looking back to Sapnap\u2019s car and looking forward. Dream made a split second decision, deciding to swerve close to Sapnap. Dream\u2019s movements obviously threw the raven off as he panicked, veering away from Dream\u2019s shiny red, untouched car (that risked being scratched or worse, dented, because he wasn\u2019t thinking clearly and was, quite frankly, being an idiot).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Nails that looked so devilishly pretty when pale hands slid against Dream\u2019s cock with deliberate slowness, letting Dream feel the curve of his palm against him and the softness of long fingers. </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> Fuck, </em>he wanted George so bad. Bad enough to race unfairly, it seemed. He wanted the feeling of his heavenly fingers on his cock again, wanted the feeling of his mouth working wonders as he went down, taking all of Dream into his mouth with little struggle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An exhilarated grin spread across his face as he laughed, pushing the gas pedal down impossibly more. His car easily passed Sapnap\u2019s by a substantial amount, causing a burst of pride to surge through his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was going to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honestly, not like it mattered, because George didn\u2019t seem all too interested in Sapnap in the first place...but, it was still so fucking fun.</p>\n<p>Dream could see their shittily marked finish line approaching. Sapnap\u2019s car still had the opportunity to pass Dream, still had the opportunity to win. The blond wasn\u2019t too into that, the idea of Sapnap somehow ending up with George for the night, even if it was just a regular hangout. Dream wanted George\u2019s eyes on him, and only him.</p>\n<p>Feet, inches, <em> right fucking there\u2014 </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201c </em>\u2014Yes!\u201d Dream let out a loud, boisterous cackle as he crossed the line, turning his steering wheel abruptly to spin out, foot grinding on the brake. His tires screeched with finality as dark, black marks appeared on the asphalt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like Dream mentioned before, not much goes his way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, naturally, one of his tires hits something, and it hits <em> hard. </em> Dream\u2019s eyes flew open as his mouth clamped shut, a gasp tearing itself from his throat. His car stills, leaving him to breathe heavily and wonder what the <em> fuck </em>he just hit.</p>\n<p>Dream threw open his driver\u2019s side door with shaky hands from the adrenaline and fear. He hobbled out of the car, ignoring Sapnap\u2019s aggressive shouting as his eyes zeroed in on the absolute <em> mess </em>of his tire. Really, Dream thought he might cry.</p>\n<p>His beautiful, sexy, perfect, wonderful, amazing\u2014<em> everything </em> his car is, or once was\u2014was now atrocious. His jaw dropped at the broken rim on his tire, and there was a new, odd bubble in his tire. That would be an easy fix, but when would he be able to bring his car to the shop? There was no <em> way </em>he could race like that until then, no chance in the whole world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His car looked repulsive now, and looking at the culprit of the damage made him want to laugh and scream and cry and bitch about how <em> stupid </em> it was. Just a rock, maybe one he <em> shouldn\u2019t </em> have hit with his car, but <em> still. </em>Why was it on the road in the first place?</p>\n<p>\u201cDream!\u201d George\u2019s voice sounded cheerily from behind the blond, jogging happily. Dream didn\u2019t remove his eyes from his rim and tire, still sulking over the money he\u2019d have to pay eventually, his pride now gone fully down the drain. When was the last time he wrecked any of his cars, anyways? Forever ago, if he ever did.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d George frowned as he stopped by Dream\u2019s side, placing his gentle hand on the taller man\u2019s forearm. Dream pouted, turning to look at the brunet.</p>\n<p>\u201cDream! You little\u2014oh, fuck,\u201d Sapnap snorted before bursting out in laughter as soon as he came into view of the car\u2019s wheel. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get, asshole! What was that little stunt you pulled?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Dream sighed, a dumb smile forming on his face. \u201cI was being an ass, okay, I got my karma now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeserved,\u201d George hummed, \u201c<em> very </em>deserved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dream rolled his eyes and wrapped his arm around George\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe should get going though. I can probably take her\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Did you just refer to your car as <em> \u2018her </em>?\u2019\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014to the shop,\u201d Dream glared playfully at George, who had his head cocked to the side in bewilderment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream and George piled into Dream\u2019s car hurriedly, and Dream was out of there in seconds. He was definitely not wanting to risk having the cops on their ass again. He was still mindful of his tire, because as much as they needed to get out of there, he didn\u2019t want his tire bursting <em> and </em>the cops on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know anyone who owns a shop?\u201d George asked, sliding his hand onto Dream\u2019s thigh. The blond\u2019s breath caught in his throat as he looked at George from his peripherals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, uh, my buddy Sam,\u201d Dream said, eyes gazing down to George\u2019s hand, paleness clashing with the dark navy blue of his jeans. He looked back up, forcing his eyes to stay on the road as he navigated his way to where Sam\u2019s auto shop was. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s there right now, but we can wait around until then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d George replied with a small smile, hiding his face from the blond as he looked out of the passenger window. Dream caught it though, and a smile of his own grew on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking, princess?\u201d Dream hummed, dropping one of his hands off the wheel to place it on top of George\u2019s. George turned his hand over, allowing Dream to weave their fingers together. Dream\u2019s heart warmed as he pulled into the parking lot of the auto shop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As expected, Sam\u2019s car was not there. The garage doors were closed too, but Dream had a key to get inside and open them. Him and Sam were childhood friends so it was common sense that Sam trusted him enough to give him spare keys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, okay, baby?\u201d Dream mumbled as he pulled in front of the closed garage door, leaning over to place a kiss on George\u2019s lips. The brunet\u2019s hand flew to the back of Dream\u2019s neck, keeping him in place as he kissed back eagerly. Dream smiled and chuckled into the kiss, moving over to kiss at the corners of George\u2019s lips instead of where he wanted.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d George whimpered and let go of Dream\u2019s neck. The blond snickered and pulled away, pushing the door open so he could get out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After digging in his pockets for a good minute and a half, Dream unlocked the front door of the shop and walked in, welcoming the cool A/C, a major difference from the blistering heat outside. He knew it would be even hotter in the garage area, but he didn\u2019t really care at the moment. He unlocked the door to the garage, sighing as the heat pushed against him. It smelled like, well, <em> cars </em>(not that Dream was complaining). He ran his hand up the frame of the door and stopped beside the buttons that controlled the garage door, pushing gingerly against the one that opened it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, the metal door retracted, revealing Dream\u2019s red beauties. George leaned against the side of the car, inspecting his pristine red nails in the sun. Dream\u2019s gut swirled with a flurry of emotions as he smiled warmly at the brunet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d Dream beckoned, letting his arm hang in the air until the brunet had skipped up to him happily, properly sticking himself to Dream\u2019s side. George giggled, sounding sweet and gentle, like honey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBring your car in here, idiot,\u201d George said fondly and pushed the palm of his hand against Dream\u2019s chest. Dream huffed dramatically and went to bring his car into the garage. He put it in park, twisting his keys inward to turn off his car, and gently shut the car door as he got out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just as he was about to say some shitty joke about him <em> maybe </em>deserving the scuff on his tire, he heard the sound of the garage door shutting, eyes immediately shooting to where the controls were. George held eye contact, an innocent smile playing on his lips as the outside light slowly faded, leaving them with poorly lit industrials above.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d Dream furrowed his brows, barely even blinking before George\u2019s lips were connected with his, red lipstick staining itself onto Dream\u2019s lips for the third time that day. Dream made a strangled noise before returning the favor, big hands going to rest on George\u2019s slim hips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>George still tasted like the cherry lollipop he had earlier. More faint, for sure, but still there. Dream groaned, pressing his lips against George\u2019s harder. He knew he was being greedy, but to be fair, he didn\u2019t know when Sam would be back. Speaking of, maybe he should text him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorge,\u201d Dream mumbled sloppily against George\u2019s lips, placing his hand flat against the middle of the smaller man\u2019s chest. \u201cLet me at least find out when Sam is supposed to get back.\u201d</p>\n<p>George scoffed and rolled his eyes, pulling back to watch Dream fumble to unlock his phone. He managed to pull up his messages with Sam and send him a quick text of <em> hey when will you be back to the shop </em>with shaky fingers. He got a response almost immediately, with Sam saying around an hour and a half. Dream nearly dropped his phone as he haphazardly slid it into his back pocket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s hands found themselves crading George\u2019s stunning face, even though his lipstick was smudged and his cheeks were a bright cherry red. George welcomed Dream\u2019s lips on his again, kissing back with just as much enthusiasm. George\u2019s hands explored every part of Dream he could reach\u2014his clothed chest and abdomen, his nicely toned arms, his lower back, and a quick pinch to his ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream growled into George\u2019s mouth, biting down roughly onto George\u2019s lower lip. He pulled back, eyes blinking open to find George staring right back at him, pupils blown wide in desperation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWant you,\u201d George breathed hotly, eyes sliding shut as he parted his lips and granted Dream access to his wet cavern. Pure want and need churned in Dream\u2019s gut from George\u2019s words, despite how simple they were. He could feel himself beginning to go rigid as the brunet pressed his body closer to Dream\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream tilted his head, running his tongue against George\u2019s. He walked George back against the front of his car, effectively pinning him to the hood. They hissed as George\u2019s back and Dream\u2019s hand pressed against the hood, still sizzling from being in the sun for hours on end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSam said he\u2019d be back in an hour and a half,\u201d Dream panted heavily, ghosting his slicked lips against George\u2019s. A thin strand of saliva connected the two and Dream used his thumb to wipe it away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d George said with a playful glint in his eyes, \u201cwe have time.\u201d The brunet rolled his hips up onto Dream\u2019s, both of them shuddering a moan at the way their erections rubbed against one another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s hand on George\u2019s cheek went to his thigh, slowly sliding his neatly trimmed nails up the pale expanse of skin until he hooked his fingers around the underside of his thighs. The pads of Dream\u2019s fingers dug into George\u2019s flesh, guiding his leg to wrap around the blond\u2019s middle. Without having to be told, George\u2019s other leg followed suit, bringing Dream impossibly closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At one point or another, the kiss had become just teeth, with Dream tugging lightly on the tip of George\u2019s tongue. A quiet moan pushed past George\u2019s lips, fueling the pit of lust in Dream\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He trailed soft kisses down to George\u2019s jawline, smirking as George craned his neck. George\u2019s nimble fingers threaded through Dream\u2019s dirty blond locks, fingernails scraping against his scalp. Dream\u2019s hand that was flat against the hood of his car moved to slide under the brunet\u2019s crop top, exposing his pretty pink nipples clad in metal barbells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream ran his thumb over his pink bud and the cold metal, revelling in the way George writhed beneath him, a needy whine passing his lips. Dream bit and sucked down on George\u2019s soft skin, leaving many marks that would soon turn a deep purple, contrasting his milky skin. He rolled his tongue sweetly over the bruises, blowing gently onto them with a knowing look in his eyes as George groaned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2014get <em> on </em>with it already,\u201d George sighed, rutting his hips against Dream\u2019s. Dream clicked his tongue and pinched the smaller man\u2019s thigh, shaking his head in disapproval and slight amusement at the way George whimpered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPatience, Princess,\u201d Dream smirked, licking a stripe up his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time, though,\u201d George pointed out, accentuating his words with another roll of his hips. \u201cPlus, isn\u2019t this the prize you wanted?\u201d He added with a smug smile.</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s tongue darted out to wet his lips, eyes watching George\u2019s for a moment as the latter pushed out his bottom lip, arching his back into Dream\u2019s touch in a silent plea for more. Dream chuckled lowly, twisting one of the barbells in his left hand and observing the way George\u2019s face twisted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Dream,\u201d George gasped, hands hooking under Dream\u2019s tight fitting shirt. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on, baby,\u201d Dream murmured, mirth dripping from his voice. He leaned back and lifted his shirt over his head, tossing it to the side without care. It landed with a soft noise while Dream surged forward to reconnect their lips back into a sloppy kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s hands caressed George\u2019s stomach, fingers unbuttoning the brunet\u2019s crimson shorts with ease as George disconnected from Dream to toss his croptop away. They were both breathing heavily, with Dream\u2019s fingers hooked around the waistband of George\u2019s shorts. Instinctually, George spread his legs to help him get them off.</p>\n<p>George was looking up at Dream with glazed over eyes, wet lips bitten and kissed raw with lipstick smudged around his lips and onto his chin\u2014and Dream can imagine he isn\u2019t any better at the moment. The smaller man\u2019s cheeks were flushed an alluring bright red, nearly matching the color of Dream\u2019s car below him. Dream narrowed his eyes and chewed on his bottom lip, leaning down next to George\u2019s ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re fucking gorgeous,\u201d Dream said huskily, tugging the last of George\u2019s clothes off his body. George whined as his cock sprang free, slapping lightly against his stomach. Dream glanced down and chuckled, gingerly wrapping his thick fingers around George\u2019s length.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll dolled up for me,\u201d Dream huffed a breath of laughter. \u201cToo bad I fucked it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>George mewled quietly, thrusting his hips up to encourage Dream\u2019s hand. Dream kept his hand movements languid, relishing the frustrated tears welling up in George\u2019s umber eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Dream, </em>\u201d The brunet grabbed a handful of blond hair, forcing Dream to tip his head back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPrincess likes to beg,\u201d Dream teased, swiping his thumb over the head of George\u2019s leaking cock. George\u2019s eyelashes fluttered as his head lolled back, resting it on the hood of Dream\u2019s car. Dream cooed quietly and sped up his hand movements, his other hand reaching down to knead George\u2019s ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d George whispered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream\u2019s hand went lower, about to teasingly circle George\u2019s rim when he felt something solid. He stopped both hand movements, an obnoxious smirk spreading across his face as George\u2019s face burned a deeper red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll prepped and ready for me, baby boy?\u201d Dream chuckled fondly. George nodded with furrowed brows, turning his head away in an attempt to hide his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Dream lowered himself to press a quick chaste kiss onto George\u2019s collarbones before he pushed off the car and rounded it to throw open the driver\u2019s side door. He reached for the center console, popping it open to dig around for a few seconds before wrapping his fingers around what he needed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he returned to George, the brunet had pushed his thighs together in a weak attempt to hide himself, probably feeling exposed from just laying, naked, on Dream\u2019s car. Dream couldn\u2019t imagine how sweaty George\u2019s back side was\u2014Dream already had sweat building on his hairline, the back of his neck, and his upper lip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReady, baby?\u201d Dream winked at George, fingertips tracing the circular object in George\u2019s hole. Dream looked down, drool building in his mouth at the red jewel that stared back at him. George <em> really </em>had a thing for sporting Dream\u2019s colors, didn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, fuck Dream, I\u2019ve <em> been </em>ready,\u201d George whimpered, brows scrunched in pent up frustration. The tears in his eyes still threatened to fall, sweat that had caused his hair to stick to his forehead trickled down the side of his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already look so fucked out, and I haven\u2019t even fucked you,\u201d Dream snickered cruelly, twisting the plug in George\u2019s ass. The brunet quivered, yanking at Dream\u2019s hair again, eliciting another low chuckle from the blond.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A pathetic whimper left George\u2019s lips as Dream removed the plug, deciding after a few seconds of contemplating to place it on his discarded shirt. He prodded his thumb at George\u2019s hole, lips twitching upwards at the way his hole fluttered greedily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Desperate fingers quickly pushed down Dream\u2019s jeans and boxers, falling unceremoniously to his ankles. Dream flicked up the cap of the lube and poured a generous amount onto his fingers, bringing them down to his length. Maintaining eye contact with the writhing brunet, Dream spread the lube onto his cock and pressed his tip against George\u2019s hole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Dream, hurry up,\u201d George\u2019s hands latched onto Dream\u2019s shoulders, red nails digging into the tan, freckled skin. Dream hissed quietly at the sting, though the pain wasn\u2019t unwelcomed.</p>\n<p>Dream knew he was going a little too slow for the time frame they were given, but in the moment, he could give less of a fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeorgie,\u201d Dream leaned his chest down onto George\u2019s, placing one hand onto the smaller man\u2019s hip and one on his chest. His fingers ran lightly over his soft erect bud, teeth sinking into George\u2019s bottom lip. \u201cGonna be good for me? Gonna take me so well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d George whispered, eyes squeezing shut as large tears finally spilled from his eyes. He sniffled, arms and thighs shaking from how bad he wanted Dream. \u201cPlease fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Princess,\u201d Dream purred, licking into George\u2019s mouth as he slowly pushed in. The brunet tensed below him, nails scraping lines down the blond\u2019s shoulder blades. Dream could feel every part of George as he bottomed out, hips flush with George\u2019s ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream allowed George a second to adjust and breathe, waiting for him to tell Dream to move. George\u2019s tears had dried, leaving pale streaks down his pink face. George\u2019s eyes opened slowly as he rocked his hips back, moaning as the tip of Dream\u2019s cock ghosted his prostate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Dream asked, brushing George\u2019s bangs back. George leaned into Dream\u2019s touch, lazily nodding with big doe eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream pressed a sweet kiss to George\u2019s sweaty forehead, pulling out until just the tip rested in George, then thrusted in with a grunt. George moaned loudly, back arching as Dream began to pound into him relentlessly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The weeks he spent with his hand down his pants, wishing it was George\u2019s hands instead of his own, was evident in the way he fucked George. He had been wanting, needing, <em> craving </em> George since the first race, since the first time they fucked around. And now, <em> now, </em>he finally had him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had George pinned against the hood of his own <em> car, </em> for fuck\u2019s sake <em> . </em> Legs spread all pretty, head thrown back in pure ecstasy. Tears slipped down George\u2019s cheeks as Dream picked up his pace with a bruising grip on his waist. He wanted marks to be there; all for George to see when he changes, showers, <em> anything.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He had George moaning like they were the only two people to exist in the world, like they were in their own little isolated bubble. And they were.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the nasty, hard-to-breathe-in car garage, Dream fucked George like his life depended on it. In the nasty, dimly lit car garage, Dream fucked George like he was worshipping him, giving in to each and every want and need the brunet asked for. In the nasty, car-smelling garage, Dream fucked George like it was his one and only chance to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(News flash: it definitely wasn\u2019t going to be).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream made a split-second decision and pulled out, giving George enough time to make a noise of confusion before he was flipped onto his stomach with a hand pressing between his shoulder blades. Dream pushed back in, eagerly returning to fucking the life out of George.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A wanton moan passed George\u2019s pretty, plump lips as he arched his back, hands clenching in on themselves because he had nothing else to grab. Dream pressed hard on George\u2019s back (mindful of his nipple piercings scraping his car, mind you), changing his angle in the slightest, and rightfully receiving a choked out half-moan, half-scream.</p>\n<p>\u201cDream!\u201d George cried out, gasping and moaning as Dream\u2019s hand on the middle of George\u2019s shoulder blades slid up, instead grabbing a fistful of brown hair to crane George\u2019s head backwards. George let out a strangled sob, grinding back in time with Dream\u2019s thrusts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Princess?\u201d Dream groaned, leaning down to nibble at the shell of George\u2019s ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cT-Touch me,\u201d George begged, hiccuping through his moans and tears, \u201cplease!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything for you,\u201d Dream pressed his mouth against George\u2019s neck to leave open-mouthed kisses as the grip in George\u2019s hair loosened, the hand ghosting down the brunet\u2019s stomach until he enveloped George\u2019s length into his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The brunet keened at that, moans becoming breathy and tears coming out uncontrollably. Dream could feel the heat in his stomach beginning to coil, could feel the drag of his own cock on George\u2019s walls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDream\u2014s\u2019close,\u201d George moaned, turning his head to look at Dream through glossy eyes. Dream might\u2019ve cum right then and there if he wasn\u2019t holding off for George. George bit his lips before his jaw went slack, \u201c<em> Please. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Fuck, </em>\u201d Dream pressed his lips against George\u2019s\u2014not exactly a kiss, but more of their lips brushing as they moaned into each other\u2019s mouths. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m close too.\u201d</p>\n<p>George\u2019s hips went lax as he tensed around Dream, spurts of white spilling from his flushed cock and onto Dream\u2019s hand and bright red car. Dream bit down on George\u2019s shoulder and moaned, releasing deep inside of George.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dirty blond rode them through their orgasms until it was just a bit too much, both wincing as he pulled out. Dream rolled onto his back on his car, glancing over to see just how fucked out George looked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His fluffy brown hair was sticking up in every way possible, some of it damp and sticking to his forehead. His eyeshadow and mascara was pretty much ruined, leaving dark streaks down his cheeks where he had been crying. His lipstick was absolutely gone, only leaving a barely visible red tint to his already pink lips. Dream smiled warmly and leaned forward to press their lips together in a short, sweet kiss. A kiss that spoke volumes, though no words were exchanged.</p>\n<p>And then he remembered that they barely had any time to clean up before Sam arrived.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly sh\u2014<em> George </em>!\u201d Dream gasped, eyes flying open as he pushed off of his car. George blinked, dazed and very, very confused. His eyes followed Dream\u2019s frantic movements to get his clothes back on, to get a box of tissues out of his car, and to clean the mess off of George and his car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you all...worked up about?\u201d George slurred as he started pulling his own garments on. Dream stopped in his tracks, deadpanning the brunet with tight lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSam.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d George giggled and finished buttoning the last button on his high waisted shorts. Dream rolled his eyes fondly and sighed as soon as they looked mildly presentable\u2014well, minus George\u2019s absolutely wrecked hair and the makeup tracks down his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Dream ruffled George\u2019s hair, taming it mostly, and stuck his tongue out as the brunet scowled and swatted his hand away. Dream then licked the pad of his thumb and gently rubbed away the black makeup stains on George\u2019s cheeks, which made the smaller man feign disgust.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen is Sam even\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014Hey Dream!\u201d A familiar voice sounded from the entrance. Dream mustered up the best grin he could, definitely <em> not </em>feeling awkward, and gave a small wave. Sam stepped into the garage, eyes falling from Dream to George, where a puzzled look crossed his face, \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014George,\u201d The aforementioned cut in, sticking out his hand with a sickeningly innocent smile. Sam beamed, taking George\u2019s hand in his. \u201cYou\u2019re Sam, correct?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep! That\u2019s the name,\u201d Sam chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, George.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you too,\u201d George stepped away so Sam and Dream could talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Dream,\u201d Sam walked over to the blond\u2019s car, slowly circling it. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, driver\u2019s side tire,\u201d Dream said with a sheepish grin. \u201cI hit a rock after Sap and I\u2019s race today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like something you\u2019d do,\u201d Sam shook his head lightheartedly before stopping in front of the tire, crouching to get a better look at it. George and Dream exchanged glances as he did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>George migrated to Dream\u2019s side, looking up at him with wide eyes before muttering, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Sam doesn\u2019t have cameras.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Dream couldn\u2019t help but silently agree with his loud, signature wheeze and a slap to his knee. When Dream finally looked back up to George, pure contentment visible in his emerald eyes, George smiled. His smile reached his eyes, his lower lids squinting as a giggle sweet as honey fell past his lips. Dream returned the smile easily with one small, enamored thought:</p>\n<p>George would definitely be sticking around and Dream was <em> definitely </em>fucked.\u00a0</p>"
