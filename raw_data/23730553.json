  "summary": "<p>Geralt is no longer the Butcher of Blaviken. But when Jaskier is taken and tortured by soldiers from Nilfgaard, his tightly held morality frays at the edges. Joined by Lambert and Eskel, he sets out to rescue Jaskier and slaughter the men foolish enough to harm him. Nilfgaard was prepared for the rage of the White Wolf. They aren't prepared for his brothers. </p>\n<p>Because Jaskier belongs to <em>all</em> the wolves of Kaer Morhen, and they will raze kingdoms to keep him safe. </p>\n<p>Takes place after If I Starve, but can be read as a standalone. All relationships besides Geralt/Jaskier are platonic.</p>",

  "text": "<p>The night air is sweet after so long spent in a tavern. Those places always smell of piss, ale, and sex, but the lovely folks of this particular establishment in Sodden are even more unwashed than usual. It\u2019s the kind of stench that would have turned Jaskier away, were Geralt travelling with him. As it so happens, he is alone for the week, and expects to be so until he can meet up with Eskel farther North. </p>\n<p> Jaskier slings his lute over his shoulder and leans his hip against a tree outside the tavern, fully intending to relax a little in the darkness before returning to his room and the stench that accompanies it. The footsteps that crunch behind him threaten a change of plan. </p>\n<p> He does not turn around. Any patron coming to request a song, or perhaps a fuck, would have announced themselves by now. Jaskier tilts his head to the side as if trying to catch a conversation from within the tavern, doing his best to seem as though he has not noticed whoever is approaching him. Steel burns cold against his fingertips as he lets the dagger drop from his sleeve and into his hand. </p>\n<p> \u201cBard,\u201d a gruff voice calls. </p>\n<p> Jaskier turns, an expression of pleased surprise carefully arranged on his face. Two men stand before him. Large, and judging from their stances, trained, but they\u2019re no witchers. Jaskier\u2019s sparring mates at Kaer Morhen have more than prepared him for two common village thugs. </p>\n<p> \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he greets, \u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201d They\u2019re here for the heavy coin purse at his hip, of course, but it never hurts to be cordial with one\u2019s enemies. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re the bard who travels with that witcher.\u201d It\u2019s said as a statement, but Jaskier can hear the question in it. Dropping Geralt\u2019s name has gotten him out of many a brawl in the past few years. He decides to give it a shot. </p>\n<p> \u201cIndeed I am. The witcher of whom you speak is Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf and muse to one humble bard.\u201d Jaskier dips into a shallow bow, using the motion to hide how he adjusts the knife in his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s just upstairs, waiting for me to finish my performance so he can tell me the tale of his latest monstrous conquest.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d the second man says. Jaskier doesn\u2019t like the look of the sword at his hip. \u201cYou rode into town alone.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAh,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cYou certainly are observant, for a mugger. I don\u2019t suppose if I hand over my coin purse you\u2019ll turn around and leave me alone? Forget this little meeting ever happened?\u201d</p>\n<p> Both men step forward menacingly, and Jaskier hears more footsteps behind him. At least three, then. Maybe more. Jaskier is an optimistic sort of person, but the odds aren\u2019t looking great. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhere's the girl?\u201d </p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s breath catches in his throat. Ciri. The little ray of sunshine and remarkable magic- Geralt\u2019s Child Surprise. She\u2019s safely ensconced at Kaer Morhen with Vesemir and a rather deadly purple-eyed sorceress, but Jaskier would rather die than tell these brutes that. Impenetrable though Kaer Morhen seems to be, Jaskier will not send an army to its gates. </p>\n<p> \u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest who you mean, good sir. Unless of course you mean the lovely innkeep\u2019s daughter, and on that matter I am sworn to secrecy.\u201d He\u2019s talking out of his ass, letting his mouth move how it wants as he focuses in on the pendant at his throat. A direct line to his wolves. </p>\n<p> <em>They\u2019re after Ciri.</em></p>\n<p> \u201cDon\u2019t play coy, bard. You don\u2019t have your witcher around to protect you this time. Tell us where the girl is and we\u2019ll let you walk away alive.\u201d </p>\n<p> Breathing behind him. The clink of metal on metal, and the harsh smell of unwashed bodies. At least two behind him, Jaskier decides, though he can't be sure until he turns around, and he knows that such a move at this point in the conversation would be a grave mistake. The second man is larger and stands with more surety. That\u2019s where he\u2019ll aim his first strike. </p>\n<p> <em>Who, Jaskier? Where are you?</em></p>\n<p> Geralt\u2019s voice. Oh, Geralt. Jaskier wishes he were here, and not just for his battle prowess. He so hates sleeping in an empty bed. </p>\n<p> Jaskier makes a show of considering the man\u2019s threat, taking his time to answer through the pendant. <em>Thugs. I count four, maybe more. Somewhere in Sodden, a three day\u2019s ride from where I left Lambert.</em></p>\n<p> \u201cSo, I tell you where the princess is, and you don\u2019t kill me? Have I got that right?\u201d Jaskier scratches at his chin as an excuse to have his hand up higher. He\u2019ll need it to block with, in a moment. \u201cWell my good sir, I only have one thing to say. Fuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier lunges as they process his words. He\u2019s at the larger man\u2019s side before he can draw his sword, dagger sliding elegantly through his jerkin and into the soft flesh of his stomach. The dagger is wet with blood as Jaskier darts away, his back to the tavern and his eyes on his attackers. Five of them, counting the one he just killed. He\u2019ll really need to work on his hearing next winter, if three people managed to sneak up behind him. </p>\n<p> <em>Fuck. Don\u2019t fight, Jaskier. Run. You can\u2019t take that many.</em></p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s voice that time. As the soldiers draw their blades and encircle him, Jaskier bares his teeth. </p>\n<p> <em>Little late for that, darling.</em></p>\n<p> He dodges the first blow easily enough. His attackers weren\u2019t expecting Jaskier to have any combat training, and they\u2019re rattled from the death of their comrade. It doesn\u2019t last long. He spins out of the way of one sword only to find another at his back. Jaskier drops to the ground and kicks with one leg, rising as the soldier he struck falls and sinking his dagger into the man\u2019s throat. </p>\n<p> Two down, but the remaining three are angry. Jaskier takes a slash to the knee and crumples, hitting the ground too fast to break his own fall. He rolls away from the sword that is stabbed into the ground an inch from his shoulder. </p>\n<p> \u201cStop!\u201d one man shouts. \u201cWe need him alive.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThe bastard killed Fingal,\u201d another snarls. Jaskier uses the distraction to jump to his feet and run. </p>\n<p> <em>Jaskier?</em> Geralt shouts in his mind. <em>Get the fuck out of there.</em></p>\n<p> He doesn\u2019t make it very far. The knee slows him down, and his attackers are fast. One of them tackles him to the ground, crushing his lute in the process, and wrestles Jaskier\u2019s dagger away from him. There\u2019s another in his boot, and a few throwing knives in his belt, but Jaskier has no way of getting to them. He fights as best he can with only fists and curse words. </p>\n<p> The soldier on his back hauls him up, holding Jaskier\u2019s hands behind his back in a harsh grip. His companion, the one shouting about the men Jaskier killed, comes up to them with fire in his eyes. He brings the pommel of his sword down hard. </p>\n<p> The last thing Jaskier hears before he passes out is Geralt, screaming his name.</p>\n<p>\n<em>They\u2019re after Ciri.</em>\n</p>\n<p> Geralt\u2019s blood runs like ice when he hears it. Jaskier\u2019s voice, sharp and panicked in his ear, hauling him out of the meditative state he\u2019d sunk into after taking out a nest of harpies. Talkative though he is, Jaskier understands the danger of speaking through the pendants too often. He can\u2019t know when one of his witchers is in the middle of a battle, so he uses their bond sparingly. </p>\n<p> <em>Who, Jaskier? Where are you?</em></p>\n<p> He puts out his campfire and saddles Roach as he says it, already planning the distance to the nearest town. Last he heard, Lambert and Jaskier were together in the South. </p>\n<p> <em>Thugs. I count four, maybe more. Somewhere in Sodden, a three day\u2019s ride from where I left Lambert.</em></p>\n<p> Sodden- the opposite side of the continent. Stupid, so stupid to leave him alone. Nilfgaard knows about Ciri. About Geralt. And if they know Geralt\u2019s name, they know his bard\u2019s. Jaskier made sure of that. </p>\n<p> The bird pendant is warm against his skin, trapped still beneath his armor as Geralt sets Roach down the road at a furious clip. Lambert\u2019s voice vibrates down the line. </p>\n<p> <em>Fuck. Don\u2019t fight, Jaskier. Run. You can\u2019t take that many.</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier won\u2019t listen. He never does. </p>\n<p> <em>Little late for that, darling.</em></p>\n<p> Geralt grits his teeth. He trained Jaskier himself, so he knows the man can hold his own, but anyone organized enough to go after Jaskier for information on Ciri will be professionals. Nilfgaard, most likely, or mercenaries on their payroll. He\u2019s a bard for fuck\u2019s sake, not a warrior. Whatever fight Jaskier is in right now, he\u2019s going to lose. And when he does\u2026</p>\n<p> Shouting his name down the pendant does nothing. Only silence echoes back. </p>\n<p> <em>Where\u2019d he go?</em> Eskel asks. </p>\n<p> <em>Unconscious, probably,</em> Lambert answers. <em>If it\u2019s Ciri they\u2019re after, they won\u2019t kill him.</em></p>\n<p> The \u201cyet\u201d goes unspoken. Geralt can feel worry spiraling down the connection between them. It matches his own. They\u2019ve practiced communicating with the pendants extensively, learning to control the direction of their messages and the strength of the voices in their heads. It takes intent, usually, to send a thought down the bond, but feelings can spill over in times of distress. </p>\n<p> <em>Where are you both?</em> Lambert asks, urgency in his voice. <em>I\u2019m a few day\u2019s ride away. They\u2019ll be gone by the time I get there.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Kaedwen.</em> </p>\n<p> <em>Southern Temeria.</em></p>\n<p> He curses. Lambert is closest, but none of them are close enough. Roach flies down the road and his brothers fall silent. Geralt makes it to a city within the hour, riding into town like the wind itself and swinging off his horse before she\u2019s fully stopped. He bursts into a tavern and people skitter back from the door, fear tainting the air around them. He slams a fist down on the bar, rattling the shelves. </p>\n<p> \u201cIs there a mage in this town?\u201d</p>\n<p> There\u2019s blood on his armor and rage in his eyes, and Geralt knows he looks more monster than man. He can\u2019t bring himself to care. The maid behind the counter shakes, looking at everything but him.</p>\n<p> \u201cAye, Master Witcher,\u201d she chokes out. \u201cDown the road, in the little shack with the blue door.\u201d</p>\n<p> He\u2019s gone before the last syllable falls, slamming the door behind him so hard it shakes the building\u2019s frame. The mage\u2019s house is exactly where she described. It has a roof in need of new thatching and a door so small Geralt has to duck when he shoulders his way through it. </p>\n<p> The woman inside jumps up from her table at the sight of him. Her supper is forgotten when he drops a pile of coins by her mug and says, \u201cPortal. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert describes his surroundings as best he can and Geralt relays them in halting words. Seconds later, a portal opens on the street. Geralt leads Roach through and it snaps shut behind them. </p>\n<p> It was day in Kaedwen, but here it is dark. He\u2019s in a field of wheat that sways with mocking calmness in the evening breeze. Lambert stands a few feet from him, the same dark anger swimming in his eyes that Geralt knows lives in his own. They embrace, just briefly, parting with a slap on the back and tension in their jaws. There is no joy in this reunion. </p>\n<p> \u201cEskel?\u201d Geralt asks. </p>\n<p> \u201cOn his way. Says there\u2019s a sorcerer not far from him, should be here before dawn.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s voice echoes in his mind. <em>Little late for that, darling.</em></p>\n<p> \u201cDo we have until dawn?\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s hand curls into a fist. \u201cThey won\u2019t kill him.\u201d </p>\n<p> He\u2019s right. Whoever has Jaskier won\u2019t kill him until they get what they want. But they will hurt him. They\u2019ll do everything in their power to get him to talk, and that means knives. Blood. Broken bones and burn marks. Jaskier\u2019s life is safe, for now. It\u2019s his sanity Geralt fears for.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Jaskier wakes to a kick in the face. His head snaps back and hits something behind him. A tree, maybe? A pole? His head hurts too much to focus on anything, and someone is whispering in his ear. No, not someone. <em>Lambert</em> is whispering in his ear, repeating Jaskier\u2019s name over and over like a prayer.</p>\n<p> \u201cLambert?\u201d </p>\n<p> The kick lands on his ribs this time. Jaskier doubles over, gasping, his arms scraping against rough bark from where they\u2019re tied behind him. </p>\n<p> \u201cHe\u2019s really fucking out of it,\u201d says a voice. It\u2019s harsh, and too close by, and sounds nothing like Lambert whispering. Jaskier sucks in a deep breath and winces at the strain on his ribs. Reality filters back like sunlight through the foliage above. </p>\n<p> Lambert isn\u2019t speaking in his ear. He\u2019s in Jaskier\u2019s mind, and he needs to stay there if Jaskier is to get out of here alive. The second Niflgaard knows he can communicate with magic, they\u2019ll rip it away from him. Tilting his head back against the tree, Jaskier focuses on his pendant instead of the burning in his chest. </p>\n<p> <em>Lambert?</em></p>\n<p> Three voices shout back in elation. He winces at the sudden noise inside his skull and prays that his captors think it an effect of the kicks. His witchers, bless them, figure it out soon enough and the cacophony dies down, letting Lambert\u2019s voice come through clear. </p>\n<p> <em>Jaskier.</em> He sounds relieved. <em>Thank fuck you\u2019re awake. We\u2019re coming, I promise.</em></p>\n<p> Geralt cuts in. <em>Do you know where you are?</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier forces his eyes open and blinks at the light. He\u2019s in a clearing. The men who attacked him by the inn are cooking breakfast around a small fire. Or, two of them are. The third, whose boot was recently acquainted with Jaskier\u2019s face, stands next to his tree, brandishing a knife that hasn\u2019t seen a cleaning since the last time the man took a bath. From the stench that hangs around him, Jaskier guesses it\u2019s been at least a month. </p>\n<p> <em>Forest</em> he answers, and then he thinks <em>knife</em> as the soldier in front of him yanks on Jaskier\u2019s hair and presses that filthy blade to his throat. </p>\n<p> \u201cNot so tough now, are you?\u201d The soldier tilts his knife until it lies against Jaskier\u2019s pulse point. One twitch will press it deep enough to bleed. \u201cWake up, bard. I want you aware for this.\u201d</p>\n<p> The last vestiges of sleep fall away under the cold threat of steel. Geralt is shouting at him again, demanding to know what\u2019s going on. What\u2019s wrong. Jaskier opens his eyes wide and sends an image of the clearing rippling down the bond. Pictures act like complex thoughts and are harder to pass through the pendants, but he\u2019s been practicing. </p>\n<p> <em>Fuck.</em> Geralt curses. <em>I\u2019ll kill him.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Eloquently put, love. You have my wholehearted permission to kill them all as soon as possible.</em></p>\n<p> A vicious tug at Jaskier\u2019s hair refocuses him, and he realizes that he zoned out for too long. He\u2019ll have to be careful of that. </p>\n<p> \u201c\u2019Morning,\u201d he greets. He says it slowly, mindful of how little movements press him closer to the edge of the blade. \u201cImpressive campfire you\u2019ve got here. Didn\u2019t know scum like you could cook.\u201d</p>\n<p> Pain, sudden and sharp, flares as the soldier flicks his knife down in an arc from the side of Jaskier\u2019s neck to his sternum. Blood wells up in the shallow cut and spills dark across Jaskier\u2019s chemise. He grits his teeth against the wave of nausea that sweeps over him, shaking as he bleeds. Though, he's gratified to notice, not shaking as badly as his attacker, who is quaking with barely restrained rage. It would be funny if he weren't holding a knife.</p>\n<p> <em>Worth it</em>, he thinks. </p>\n<p> <em>Whatever you just did, Jaskier, do not do it again.</em> Eskel says the words, but Jaskier can practically see Geralt nodding along, the stormy look in his eyes that he gets whenever Jaskier does something stupid. He tunes them out. </p>\n<p> \u201cThis is <em>silk</em>\u201d he says to the soldier. \u201cIt\u2019s worth more than your pathetic life, so be careful with it.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou insolent little <em>shit</em>-\u201c</p>\n<p> \u201cIddeld,\u201d one of the other men shouts, \u201cdon\u2019t kill him. Cahir wants him alive.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAlive,\u201d the soldier, Iddeld, says. \u201cNot intact. Think if I cut a finger off he\u2019d shut the fuck up?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier stills at that. His ribs, sure. The kick to the head was a bit much, but his <em>fingers?</em> No. </p>\n<p> \u201cI think you should come eat so we can get back on the road. Rough him up later if you want, but we\u2019ve got miles to cover.\u201d</p>\n<p> Iddeld growls and plunges his knife into the wood by Jaskier\u2019s head. It nicks his ear on the way, dripping a thin, sticky line of blood onto his shoulder and distracting him from the fire down his front. It\u2019s tiny, that nick, but it brings the truth of the situation down hard on Jaskier\u2019s shoulders. </p>\n<p> He\u2019s bleeding. Freezing. Hungry. He\u2019s kingdoms away from his wolves with no way of knowing where he is or how they can get to him. Nilfgaard will break him down and he\u2019ll let them do it. The gods themselves couldn\u2019t make him betray Ciri, and as soon as Nilfgaard figures that out they\u2019ll slit his throat and dump his body somewhere, thrown aside like so much trash. Panic sinks claws into his throat. </p>\n<p> <em>Jaskier. Come back to me, lark.</em> Gods he loves that name. Geralt doesn\u2019t use it often, the oaf, partly because he\u2019s bad at dealing with feelings but mostly because he knows the effect it has on Jaskier and likes to save it for when it counts. Like when one of them has nearly died. Or will soon. Or- <em>Jaskier! Breathe. Slow and steady, lark. Relax.</em></p>\n<p> He tries his best to obey. In and out, measured as Geralt\u2019s heartbeat. </p>\n<p> <em>I\u2019m alright,</em> he manages. <em>Thank you.</em></p>\n<p> Bitter laugher echoes down the bond, distorted by magic and distance. <em>Don\u2019t thank us yet,</em> Lambert says. <em>If I hadn\u2019t left you, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess. Thank us when we get there and put a sword through that bastard\u2019s heart.</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier shakes his head a little before he realizes they can\u2019t see him. <em>Can\u2019t blame yourself, Lambert. You had no way of knowing this would happen.</em></p>\n<p> <em>We knew Nilfgaard was after Ciri. Should have figured you\u2019d be a target.</em></p>\n<p> <em>You stupid, stubborn man. None of this is on you, Lambert. None of it. It\u2019s Nilfgaard, or destiny, if you go in for that sort of thing, but not you.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Jaskier-</em></p>\n<p> He would laugh if it didn\u2019t hurt to breathe. <em>No arguing while I\u2019m in distress, darling. If you insist on blaming yourself, then come save my ass. And make me some of those scones I love when we get back to Kaer Morhen.</em></p>\n<p> <em>I will. I swear it.</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier hums quietly to himself and scoots back against the tree, trying to feel for the knives he keeps in his belt. They\u2019re gone, probably stripped away by one of the Nilfgaardians, but the knife in his boot is still there. As long as Iddeld and his asshole friends don\u2019t find out about it, Jaskier might be able to slip away in the night and wait for his wolves to find him. Better the forest than an enemy camp. </p>\n<p> <em>The last town I stopped in was called Osnor. Quaint, friendly- you can smell the tavern from a mile away. Can you all track me from there?</em></p>\n<p> Three affirmative answers ring in his ears, and that\u2019s all Jaskier needs to hear. He shuts his eyes, blocking out the sounds of the Nilfgaardians breaking camp. Riding will hurt, if they let him, but walking might be worse. He wonders, idly, if the scratch on his neck will get infected. Wouldn\u2019t that be a poetic end?</p>\n<p> One of the soldiers whose name he does not know unties him and hauls him onto his feet. Jaskier\u2019s knees creak from however long he spent curled up on the forest floor. His stomach rumbles loud enough for the soldiers to hear. They laugh, enjoying the beginnings of a hunger he knows will only get worse. </p>\n<p> Iddeld leers at him as they set out- Jaskier with his hands bound in front of him, held in place on the horse by a soldier behind him. The ride is silent save the metallic clang of armor and Jaskier\u2019s whimpers of pain when they speed up too suddenly. He ignores the aches. He ignores the blood, still freely dripping onto his shirt. He ignores the heat, and the danger, and the pain, and lets his mind sink into the pendant. </p>\n<p> <em>Tell me a story,</em> he begs his wolves. And they do.</p>\n<p>Jaskier isn\u2019t sure how long they travel. He\u2019s only half conscious for most of it, caught up in a hailstorm of pain and exhaustion. He can\u2019t remember the last time he ate. </p>\n<p> Night falls, but the soldiers do not stop. They push onward in the dark, riding for a larger camp in the southernmost part of Sodden. Jaskier doesn't know what they ride for, but it does not matter. There are not enough soldiers in the world to stand against the wrath of his witchers. </p>\n<p> The horses slow and light sears against his eyes. Campfires burn through the darkness, each one ringed by men eating and laughing as men do when they are winning a war. His captors ride past the fires. They pull up before a large tent and Iddeld pushes Jaskier off his horse. He hits the ground hard, the wind knocked out of him as a dull ache resounds from his ribcage. It\u2019s one of Iddeld\u2019s favorite places to strike. </p>\n<p> Unkind hands haul him to his feet and shove him through the opening of the tent. It smells of leather and incense, overpowering in its intensity. At the front of the tent is a throne, and in it a man, his face split by a cruel smile. Jaskier doesn\u2019t need introductions to know his name. <em>Cahir.</em></p>\n<p> Someone shoves him to his knees and he goes without protest. All of Jaskier\u2019s attention is focused on channeling the image through his pendant. The fires. The men. Cahir. Anything and everything he can see, because his witchers were expecting a fight with three mercenaries. Instead, they ride to a war camp. </p>\n<p> <em>We\u2019re a few days out,</em> Eskel says, <em>but we\u2019re coming.</em></p>\n<p> <em>I know.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Hang on, Jaskier.</em> It\u2019s Geralt this time. His voice is scraped raw, even through the magic, rough like Jaskier\u2019s is from days of screaming. There\u2019s so much Jaskier wants to tell him. Just in case this is the last time they speak. </p>\n<p> Jaskier loves his romantic gestures. Songs and poems and gifts. Geralt knows that about him. He deals with it all good naturedly, rolling his eyes and grunting his way through dramatic confessions of love. But there\u2019s more to it than that, for Jaskier. There\u2019s mornings full of sunlight, wrapped up in each other\u2019s arms. Meals on the road, better than any tavern food because they\u2019re free and they\u2019re together. Geralt\u2019s eyes. His gentle hands. The smile that lights his face when Jaskier says something ridiculous, like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s in love with such a man. Jaskier can\u2019t believe it either. If this is the last time, there is so much he needs to say.</p>\n<p> <em>Geralt, I-</em></p>\n<p> The chain around his neck is snapped off in one brutal tug.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou kidnapped the White Wolf\u2019s bard and didn\u2019t think to check him for magic?\u201d Cahir sneers. \u201cIdiots.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier can\u2019t help the whimper that escapes him. It\u2019s a weak, broken sound and he hates himself for it, but all he can see is the glint of his necklace where Cahir holds it up to a candle. His head is too quiet. Empty. It hurts more than any of the bruises Iddeld painted across his skin. The curses are gone, the mutters of his name. Geralt, Lambert, Eskel, Vesemir. Gone. </p>\n<p> He\u2019s alone.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt feels the connection break. One second Jaskier is there- hurt, but there- and the next he\u2019s gone. He stops Roach so fast it nearly throws him off. Lambert curses, a low string of words filthy enough to make Vesemir blush.</p>\n<p> They saw the camp. The soldiers. They saw Cahir, alone in a tent with Jaskier. Soft, breakable, mostly human Jaskier. Geralt wonders how much of him will be left by the time they get there. </p>\n<p> \u201cThere were at least fifty men in that camp,\u201d Eskel says quietly. </p>\n<p> \u201cNot men,\u201d Geralt mutters. \u201cBeasts. Prime for the slaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s a suicide mission.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt draws in a breath, casting his eyes to the sky. It is suicidal. Fifty on three, even three witchers, is not odds that any sane man would accept. But with the memory of Jaskier\u2019s panic in his mind- with the thought of some Nilfgaardian bastard tearing apart his bard, the one beautiful thing in his life before Ciri, the only person to ever hold him close without fear\u2026</p>\n<p> Geralt is not a sane man. </p>\n<p> \u201cI will die for him, if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel levels him with a glare that feels like a challenge. Geralt stares back. Unflinching. Unwavering. His life or Jaskier\u2019s- it\u2019s hardly a choice. </p>\n<p> After a long moment, Eskel nods. \u201cAs will I.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSo we die,\u201d Lambert says, his voice like steel. \u201cBut we bring them with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They start with fists. Strikes to his jaw that make his teeth rattle and punches to his stomach that would make him retch if there were any food in him to get rid of. One of them splits his lip and the blood tastes like metal on his tongue. They ask questions about Ciri, about the witchers. For once in his life, Jaskier keeps his mouth shut.</p>\n<p> \u201cJust tell us where the girl is,\u201d Cahir says, \u201cand this will all be over.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier spits blood into his face. </p>\n<p> That\u2019s when they get the knives out. Cahir watches for the most part, asking questions and looking at Jaskier with disdain. Like a piece of tainted meat. He\u2019s grateful for it, actually, because while the nameless soldiers that tear him apart are brutal, Cahir is <em>creative.</em></p>\n<p> The first night, Jaskier escapes with nothing worse than bruises and a chest full of slash marks. It feels like a kikimora ripped into him, but that\u2019s alright, because he\u2019s had a kikimora rip him apart before and he survived it. It took days of whining and frustration when Geralt wouldn\u2019t <em>touch</em> him for fear of tearing his stitches, but he survived it. He\u2019s determined to survive this, too.</p>\n<p> The second night they tie him down. Someone drives a metal stake through the ground and they loop a rope around it, knotting each end to one of Jaskier\u2019s wrists. Cahir towers over him with a dagger in hand. Jaskier doesn\u2019t answer his questions, just shuts his eyes and braces himself. </p>\n<p> When the pain comes, it isn\u2019t where he expected it. A soldier traces shallow cuts in a circle around his wrists, directly beneath the rope. Cahir drags his blade up the bottom of Jaskier\u2019s feet. Long, methodical lines from his heel to his toes. It\u2019s enough to make him jerk away and shout, but not enough to damage anything major. Jaskier thinks it\u2019s something of a reprieve. </p>\n<p> Then they make him stand. </p>\n<p> Two men pull him from the ground, arms still bound, and sling the rope over the branch of a tree. His body weight falls on his feet. Jaskier screams- an inhuman, ungodly sound. He can feel every rock and piece of dirt beneath him, digging into his cuts, burrowing under his skin like fire. Like poison. Jaskier tries to lift himself up, and suddenly he understands the shallow lines beneath the rope. He can\u2019t relieve the pressure on his feet without opening the wounds at his wrists. Up or down, it doesn\u2019t matter. Agony lies at both ends. </p>\n<p> He stands there for hours. When someone finally comes to cut him down, Jaskier collapses. He falls to his knees and presses his cheek to the cool earth. There are flames under his skin, shards of glass in his throat, hunger pains worse than the bruises across his stomach. The guards laugh as he weeps, and his bloody lips cannot even form a prayer. </p>\n<p> Someone fists a hand in his hair, readying him for some fresh hell, but blood loss catches up to him and Jaskier topples over into sleep.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Rage like thunder rolls over Sodden that night. The witchers rode until their horses could go no further and now they rest, anger swirling thick over their campfire. Geralt\u2019s swords have been sharpened within an inch of their lives. Eskel has counted his potions so many times that the numbers have become meaningless. Lambert sits on the ground, unmoving, staring into the flames as if he wants to consume them.</p>\n<p> Their breaths are quiet. Heartbeats slow. Silence winds around them, choking them, loud as a human scream. </p>\n<p> \u201cI miss that fucking lute,\u201d Eskel says. </p>\n<p> Two grunts of agreement meet his words. Lambert flicks his eyes up from the fire for a moment. \u201cI\u2019d take another story about Valdo Marx over this blasted silence any night.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cLast I heard, Jaskier meant to duel him.\u201d </p>\n<p> Geralt sighs. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p> An utter idiot. Silly and chatty and <em>warm.</em> Geralt misses those hands on his skin. He closes his eyes and lets himself imagine, for one blessed second, that he and Jaskier never left Kaer Morhen. Jaskier would be in bed, skin bare to the moonlight, and Geralt would slide in beside him- no space in either of their minds for things like blood or broken bones.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe is,\u201d Lambert agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things we love about him.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel and Geralt freeze. The love they hold for Jaskier is common knowledge. Whatever jealousy may have existed in the beginning, when Geralt realized that Jaskier could be his and still have love for his brothers, has long since burned away. But this? Admitting it aloud? This is something new. </p>\n<p> \u201cWe\u2026love him?\u201d Eskel asks cautiously. </p>\n<p> Lambert finally turns away from the fire. His face is cut by the flickering light, somehow softer and more stern than Geralt has ever seen it. Honesty colors his tone when he says, \u201cI do.\u201d He laughs a little- the laugh of a man with nothing left to lose. \u201cI told him so, that first winter. Haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt has, though not in so many words. He tries to tell Jaskier how he feels every night, when all that exists is the two of them and the space they carved out for themselves in the world. He says it every time he pulls Jaskier away from a monster that would have his head. He\u2019s saying it now. </p>\n<p> \u201cNot yet,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cBut I will. It\u2019ll be the first thing I say after I slit Cahir\u2019s throat.\u201d</p>\n<p> A growl rumbles from deep in Geralt\u2019s chest. \u201cCahir is mine.\u201d He meets each of his brothers\u2019 eyes in turn, making sure they understand. \u201cAnd he will die slowly. A cut for every time he laid hands on Jaskier. Until he begs for death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The splash of cold water drags Jaskier out of sleep. He wakes with a gasp that melds into a groan as yesterday\u2019s injuries make themselves known. His clothes, or what\u2019s left of them, are soaked through. Iddeld is above him, an empty bucket in his hand and a smirk twisted on his face.</p>\n<p> \u201cUp, bard. We aren\u2019t done with you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Shivers wrack his body and Jaskier licks his lips, savoring the sweet kiss of water. It\u2019s his first in a day or so. If infection or blood loss doesn\u2019t kill him, dehydration might. </p>\n<p> \u201cQuiet today, aren\u2019t you? Got any smart comments about your precious <em>silk?</em> Something more to say about the value of my life?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier feels like a raw nerve. Every part of him was rent apart with knives and fists, stripped and bared to the world. So he should stay silent. Take the taunting and hold his tongue. Buy himself some time for his wolves to arrive. </p>\n<p> But they\u2019re going to hit him anyway. </p>\n<p> \u201cDidn\u2019t know sacks of shit <em>had</em> lives. Lucky you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Iddeld grabs his throat and lifts him off the ground. Jaskier claws at his hand, kicking out. He\u2019s too weak for the blows to hurt, and the wounds on his feet reopen when they connect with Iddeld\u2019s armor, but he can see the impotent rage his resistance sparks in his attacker\u2019s eyes. A tiny curl of satisfaction settles in his gut. Nilfgaard hasn\u2019t won. Not yet. </p>\n<p> \u201cI am going to enjoy killing you,\u201d Iddeld seethes. \u201cI think I\u2019ll drive a burning poker down your worthless throat. See if you can make your <em>jokes</em> then.\u201d</p>\n<p> He lets go and Jaskier crashes to the ground. Air escapes him as he panics, breaths coming in short gasps. Slow. Geralt would tell him to go slow. He focuses on that and evens out his breathing until he can speak again. Rough though it is from screaming and bruising, his voice comes out firm. </p>\n<p> \u201cMy wolves will feast upon your heart,\u201d he spits. Whether he lives to see it or not, Jaskier knows it to be true. His witchers will rain fire upon the camp, and Jaskier\u2019s spirit will dance in Iddeld\u2019s ashes. </p>\n<p> He barely feels the kick that Iddeld delivers to his ribs. It\u2019s nothing compared to yesterday.</p>\n<p> No one else talks to him that morning, though a soldier comes over with another bucket of water every time he starts to drift off. So be it. If he can\u2019t have sleep, at least he can get something to drink. Jaskier lets his eyes fall shut even when he doesn\u2019t feel tired, opening his mouth on a snore so he can catch the water when it falls. He\u2019s drenched in an hour, but that\u2019s alright. If he stretches his poet\u2019s imagination, it almost feels like a bath. </p>\n<p> Cahir finds him at noon. He drags Jaskier by the hair and drops him at the foot of a wooden cross, hastily thrown together with splintering boards and half-rusted nails. Ugly though the thing is, Jaskier knows a whipping post when he sees one. Two men pick up his slack body and tie him to the wood. Arms spread wide, back exposed. Jaskier can hear the whisper of Cahir unfurling a whip behind him. </p>\n<p> \u201cI won\u2019t tell you where Ciri is,\u201d he says. It\u2019s all he has to hold onto.</p>\n<p> \u201cPrincess Cirilla? I can find her without you, bard.\u201d Cahir\u2019s laugh is as sharp as his knives. \u201cNo. This-\u201c He snaps the whip and grins at Jaskier\u2019s flinch. \u201cThis is just for fun.\u201d</p>\n<p> The first strike destroys what\u2019s left of his shirt. Jaskier holds in a scream out of sheer stubbornness. He recites songs in his head. Lists out every noble in his family- including titles, nicknames, and epithets- just to have something to focus on. It works for the first few lashes, but soon enough the words slip through his hands like frigid water and Jaskier is left alone with the pain.</p>\n<p> For the first time since he met Cahir, Jaskier is glad his pendant is gone. He longs for the comfort of Lambert\u2019s voice, or the monosyllables of Geralt, but it\u2019s better that they aren\u2019t connected to him. Not for this. Because Jaskier cannot keep the screams from his lips, and he knows they would flow through the necklace just as loud. He has to suffer this. His witchers don\u2019t need to hear it. </p>\n<p> Jaskier loses count of the lashes around twenty. Once or twice, Cahir swings the whip but doesn\u2019t let it connect, watching as Jaskier tenses at the noise and falls into a spiral of terror when no strike follows. If he could manage words between his shouts, Jaskier would beg for mercy. But Cahir\u2019s pace is unrelenting. All he can do is let the agony carry him along and pray, sweet gods above he does he <em>pray</em>, that his body will give up and let him sleep. </p>\n<p> It doesn\u2019t. There is no mercy in the gods, because Jaskier stays conscious until Cahir grows bored with his pain and orders the men to cut him down. He crumples like a marionette with its strings cut, hardly reacting when unwashed hands pass over his mangled back. They carry him to Cahir\u2019s tent and throw him into a tub of salt water. </p>\n<p> There isn\u2019t a scream left in Jaskier\u2019s body. Just a flinch that never seems to end and an animalistic moan that crawls its way free of his chest. The salt creeps into his wounds and sets them alight. He burns in the water, each cut shining with pain as fresh as when it was inflicted. </p>\n<p> The present is too much to bear. The future is non-existent. This will kill him, he\u2019s certain of it. Jaskier feels his mind slipping away and he welcomes the madness, falling back into memory. He\u2019s at Kaer Morhen, curled up in a pile of witchers. Geralt is tucked against his chest, Lambert and Eskel wrapped around his back. Every inch of him is safe and warm and <em>loved.</em> Jaskier holds onto that when Cahir comes back. He holds his witchers close and lets himself disintegrate.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>A swirl of air and the thick scent of magic announce the opening of a portal. Lambert is on his feet in an instant, sword in hand. Beside him, his brothers pull their weapons free.</p>\n<p> The portal opens with a flourish, and from it leak the smells of home. Venison stew and old wood. Snow and pine. The smells of Kaer Morhen. Through the portal steps Vesemir. He is fully covered in armor- carrying two swords and enough daggers to take down an army, wolf pendant proud on his chest next to a diving songbird. This is the Vesemir who walked the Path. The Vesemir who made them what they are. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhere the fuck have you been?\u201d Geralt demands. </p>\n<p> \u201cPlanning,\u201d Vesemir answers. There is a storm in his face that Lambert does not recognize. Rage so deep it could flood the continent. \u201cBottle your anger, Geralt. You\u2019ll need it soon enough.\u201d</p>\n<p> He slings a pack from his shoulder and sets it lightly on the ground. The old leather reeks of magic. A powerful mix of witcher potions and Yennefer. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re here for Jaskier?\u201d Eskel asks. </p>\n<p> \u201cYes. You three aren\u2019t the only ones who care for him. The winters will be too quiet without that lute of his.\u201d Vesemir sets his shoulders and rekindles their fire with a blast of igni. He flips open the top of his satchel, giving them a look at the magic held within. He speaks, and the tone of it sends Lambert back through the decades, when that same voice taught him his trade. To fight and maim and kill. To protect. That voice beckons them closer and whispers its plans. \u201cCome,\u201d Vesemir says. \u201cWe have monsters to destroy.\u201d</p>\n<p>From Jaskier\u2019s place on the floor, the tent wall rises sheer as a cliff. Dark and imposing, made from fabric so thick no daylight filters through. There are new burn marks on his skin from the previous night. Cahir heated a poker in his fire until it glowed white-hot and dragged it from Jaskier\u2019s knee to his hip. Dots along his shoulder blades, made with fiery daggers. New bruises along his chest from Iddeld, the brute. There\u2019s just no <em>artistry</em> in bruises. </p>\n<p> He\u2019s half mad with hunger by now. Or maybe the madness is from the pain. Whichever it is, Jaskier doesn\u2019t really care. That tent wall taunts him. It keeps him from seeing anything beyond his own prison, from smelling anything but his own blood. Jaskier wants to see the flowers again before he dies. Just once. </p>\n<p> The day passes by in a haze of screams and lashes. Cahir has long since stopped asking questions. It\u2019s a struggle to focus, to pull himself back to earth and fight to live. Jaskier is so tired. If he stopped fighting, would they kill him? Would it finally end?</p>\n<p> <em>Hold on, Jaskier,</em> Geralt said. </p>\n<p> And that\u2019s his problem, isn\u2019t it? Jaskier can\u2019t let himself slip away because Geralt is coming for him. Geralt and Lambert and Eskel. They\u2019ve had enough pain in their lives, those witchers. Broken and bloodied though he is, Jaskier itches to protect them. </p>\n<p> Nothing would hurt them as much as losing him. It\u2019s a selfish thought, yes, but also a true one. Geralt sees his own death as no great loss, that\u2019s clear enough from how he throws himself into danger, but he treats Jaskier like something precious. The best thing Jaskier can do to protect his wolves is to protect himself. To survive. </p>\n<p> So Jaskier closes his eyes against the pain, and holds on.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They attack at midnight.</p>\n<p> One witcher is stationed at each corner of the camp. Geralt takes the east, his eyes fixed on the tent in the camp\u2019s center. That\u2019s his goal. That\u2019s where they have Jaskier. Every warm body between Geralt and that tent will die by his hand. </p>\n<p> But first, there is a plan to follow. Geralt\u2019s hand falls to the pouch at his belt. The bottles within clink against each other. One vial of dark purple liquid, four green spheres of thin glass, and a slim cylinder that pulses with magic. His veins already burn with witcher potions, eyes and veins dark as the night around him. </p>\n<p> The sentries are the first to die. Eskel scouted ahead and reported on their movements. The watch shift changes over every four hours, with two men stationed along each edge of the camp. They\u2019re lazy and careless, drunk on their own power, unsuspecting of an attack so far from enemy territory. Humans, blind in the dark. </p>\n<p> Geralt slides up behind the first guard and slits his throat with a dagger. He lowers the man\u2019s body to the ground in silence. The soldier\u2019s partner turns to ask him something and gets Geralt\u2019s knife between his eyes in answer. He falls hard to the ground, but there is no one around to hear. </p>\n<p> <em>East is clear.</em></p>\n<p> <em>As is West,</em> Eskel says. </p>\n<p> Lambert and Vesemir say the same, and Geralt pulls the cylinder that reeks of magic from his pouch. He drives it into the ground with one swift kick. Yennefer gave Vesemir a word to speak and Geralt repeats it now, staring as the cylinder unfurls into a long stream of inky black and expands in an arc to his sides. Across the camp, his brothers do the same. The dark magic flickers and twists, each witcher\u2019s arc reaching out to connect with the others. </p>\n<p> <em>Ready.</em></p>\n<p> Geralt\u2019s swords sing out for battle. Steel for men. Silver for monsters. This night, with these beasts, they are one and the same.</p>\n<p> He raises his arm and aims a sign at the magic by his feet. Igni. The inky trail catches quicker than oil, flame speeding along the path to meet with the sparks from his brothers. To complete a circle around the camp. A wall of flame roars up from Yennefer\u2019s magic, taller than any man and strong as dragon fire. No human can pass through and live. </p>\n<p> Nilfgaard is trapped. </p>\n<p> And Geralt is <em>furious.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Eskel grins as the fire flares up behind him. There is a moment of silence before anyone notices, and then the silence is shattered by cries of alarm. He runs into the camp, quick as the wolf that snarls from his pendant, to catch Nilfgaard\u2019s soldiers unprepared. Armor-less and unarmed, the first wave of men falls beneath his swords like pigs at the slaughter.</p>\n<p> By the time he pulls his sword free from his latest victim, word has spread. The fighters that approach Eskel are more wary, more prepared. But they swing their weapons with the confusion of men who are still half asleep and confused. He cuts them down, too- with sharp strikes to the heart and neat slices across the throat. Eskel thinks of Jaskier\u2019s agony, his memories thick with it, and takes one soldier\u2019s head clean off his shoulders. </p>\n<p> Shouts echo through the empty night. Somewhere to his left, Lambert drives his sword through a man\u2019s knee. Bone crunches beneath steel and Lambert <em>laughs.</em> </p>\n<p> A soldier lopes toward Eskel, his armor only half in place, his sword held up in a stance that Eskel could get past unarmed. So he does. He sheathes his sword on his back and darts forward. The soldier swings, but Eskel is already inside his defenses. Knocking the sword away, he drives his hand up into the man\u2019s chin. His head whips back, his neck snaps, and he falls to the ground, dead. </p>\n<p> Blood rushes past Eskel\u2019s ears, begging him for <em>more.</em></p>\n<p> Three soldiers approach him at once. These men are fully awake, their eyes bright and their weapons held ready. They reek of fear. </p>\n<p> Eskel looks a sight. Black eyes and veins. Snarling teeth, sharp in the firelight. His armor is soaked in blood, not a drop of it his. Eskel growls and a putrid smell rises in the air as one of the Nilfgaardians pisses himself. </p>\n<p> \u201cThe Butcher of Blaviken,\u201d a soldier says. </p>\n<p> Eskel puts a blade through his throat. He ducks the next man\u2019s swing and brings his sword up hard. Steel rings out on steel. The second soldier comes up behind him but Eskel is already moving, driving a dagger into the first man\u2019s abdomen before kicking the second one down. He whirls around. His opponent\u2019s weapon bites into the leather at Eskel\u2019s shoulder. It doesn\u2019t slow him down. Eskel uses the soldier\u2019s shock to pull him close and stab him clean through. </p>\n<p> There\u2019s blood in his hair. On his armor. It runs in rivers over the ground, soaking into his shoes and tainting the soil with death. Eskel doesn\u2019t care. He steps over the fresh corpses at his feet like one would step over piles of steaming shit. <em>The Butcher of Blaviken.</em></p>\n<p> \u201cNot quite,\u201d Eskel says, \u201cbut I am his brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Jaskier wakes to shouts of panic. Steel clatters outside the tent, weapons drawn from sheaths and armor pulled on in the dark. The smell of smoke tickles his nose. Even if Jaskier had the strength to sit up and look around, the way his hands are tied to his ankles would prevent it. He contents himself with listening.</p>\n<p> A soldier bursts into the tent and salutes Cahir. \u201cAttackers, sir. We don\u2019t know how many, but they\u2019ve surrounded us with fire. We can\u2019t escape.\u201d</p>\n<p> Oh. Fire. Attackers. No escape. A laugh bubbles up in Jaskier\u2019s throat and he lets it free- a sparkling, joyful sound against the tapestry of death outside. <em>Oh, yes.</em> His witchers are here. </p>\n<p> Jaskier catches Cahir\u2019s gaze and says, \u201cYou\u2019re fucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt casts igni on the remnants of a campfire, reveling in the panic of the soldiers as it flares to life before their eyes. Six men circle around him. That\u2019s a lot, even for a witcher, but Geralt came prepared. He throws one of the green containers from his pouch into the fire. It explodes on contact, dousing Geralt and his opponents in a thin mist of poison. Deadly, for a human. Not for a witcher.</p>\n<p> The men clutch at their skin as it melts away. Geralt snarls and pushes past them, barely noticing the burn, like sleeping under too many blankets on a hot summer night. It disappears soon enough. </p>\n<p> He has lost track of his brothers in the fray. Has nearly lost track of himself, it seems. Geralt does not know how many people have fallen beneath his swords, but he knows that it is not enough to quell the tide of fury rising in his blood. Blood has stained his white hair red and still it is not enough. </p>\n<p> Acrid fear and putrid death hang heavy in the air. But through all of that, like the first rays of dawn, comes the scent of honey. Sun and wine. Joy. </p>\n<p> <em>Jaskier.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Go,</em> Vesemir orders. <em>We will handle the rest.</em></p>\n<p> Geralt sheathes his sword and <em>runs.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Lambert whirls to face his new opponent with a manic grin. The expression slides from his face when he takes in the man before him. He sees red. Feels the bruises on Jaskier\u2019s skin like his own wounds. Hears a slimy voice say <em>Wake up, bard. I want you aware for this.</em></p>\n<p> Iddeld holds out a filthy dagger. Lambert snarls at him, rushes forward, grabs the pommel from his hand, and snaps the thing in half. Iddeld\u2019s face pales. He dances out of reach and drops into a fighting stance, feet square, arms raised high. Lambert drops his sword. </p>\n<p> He will savor this kill. He will drain the light from this man\u2019s eyes and use it to fill the gaping hole that opens in his chest when he thinks of that dirty blade pressed against Jaskier\u2019s pulse. </p>\n<p> Iddeld, the fool, throws a punch. Lambert catches his fist in midair and <em>squeezes.</em> Bones grind into pieces in the vise of his grip. They break against each other and push through the skin until Iddeld\u2019s hand is a mutilated mess. <em>Think if I cut off a finger he\u2019d shut the fuck up?</em></p>\n<p> Lambert drives his knee into Iddeld\u2019s stomach. <em>Eskel,</em> he thinks, <em>look what I found.</em></p>\n<p> A rush of violent pleasure rushes through the pendant. <em>Cut his cock off and throw it in the fire,</em> his brother says. <em>Make him beg.</em></p>\n<p> Lambert does just that. And when Iddeld simpers and crawls like the swine he is, Lambert crushes his skull beneath his boot.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Beyond the flaps of the tent, Cahir waits. The Butcher of Blaviken meets him there, steel in hand and cold, hard fury in his blood. His eyes fall to a form lying prone on the ground. Burns and bites and broken bones. Blood and bruises and blue, <em>blue</em> eyes.</p>\n<p> Jaskier is tied down like an animal, flayed to the bone and far too thin, but his eyes are the same. </p>\n<p> \u201cI knew you would come,\u201d Cahir says. \u201cDo you like what I\u2019ve done with him? Pretty little bird like that, I should have known he would <em>sing.</em> The sweetest screams you\u2019ve ever heard, witcher.\u201d</p>\n<p> There is trust in those eyes. No matter how much danger Geralt puts him in, with monsters and princesses and fucking Nilfgaard, trust blazes in Jaskier\u2019s eyes. Geralt is late, but he\u2019s here. He\u2019s here. </p>\n<p> \u201cYours will be sweeter.\u201d</p>\n<p> Cahir raises his sword in challenge. \u201cKill me then, Butcher. Gut me before I gut your Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p> It\u2019s the name that does it. Geralt strikes with the full force of his wrath. Cahir grunts with the strain of blocking him, shifting backward on one foot. He steps out of the path of Geralt\u2019s blade and retaliates with a strike of his own. </p>\n<p> Cahir is no common mercenary. He carries a sword like an extension of his self and he knows how to wield it. Geralt moves faster than most humans could see, much less track and fight, but Cahir keeps up with him. His thrusts are turned away with the scream of clashing swords. His arm aches from parrying expert blows after fighting so many outside. </p>\n<p> Geralt dances backward and Cahir follows. Cahir feints to the left but sends his sword whistling upward instead, grazing Geralt\u2019s shoulder before he can move out of range. The wound comes as a shock- it\u2019s the first blood anyone has drawn on him since the battle began. Cahir presses his advantage by lunging forward and driving his sword through Geralt\u2019s side. It bleeds freely, spilling black blood over the midnight soil. </p>\n<p> He hardly feels it. His blood doesn\u2019t matter when Jaskier is in pain. Besides, Geralt doesn\u2019t need to win. </p>\n<p> Moonlight glints on silver as Geralt swings. Cahir blocks him and the two men struggle, neither able to move back, neither strong enough to press forward. Geralt snarls. Cahir slides to the side and Geralt\u2019s sword clips him in the chest. He stumbles backward, blood gushing from the wound, and freezes. He goes stock still, hardly daring to breathe. Because there behind Cahir, a point of freezing steel pressed against his neck, stands Vesemir. </p>\n<p> There is a new flap in the tent, cut open by one of Geralt\u2019s brothers while Cahir was distracted. Jaskier is gone. Vesemir stands in his place. There is retribution coiled in his muscles and ire in the set of his mouth. </p>\n<p> \u201cDrop your weapon,\u201d Vesemir says. </p>\n<p> There is nothing for Cahir to do but obey. His sword falls to the ground with a muffled thump and he falls to his knees. The reality of his position is a noose around his neck. Cahir trembles and meets Geralt\u2019s black eyes. \u201cPlease,\u201d he begs, \u201cmercy.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt has mercy. It smells of honeyed wine, and Cahir tore it apart with his whip.</p>\n<p> Vesemir holds him still as Geralt gathers what he needs. He goes outside to snap a branch off of the nearest tree and pulls thick loops of chain from one of Cahir\u2019s chests. The broken branch is splintered at one end. Geralt takes the purple vial from his pouch and douses the wood with it, taking care to soak every crevice. With that done, he wraps the chain around Cahir\u2019s wrists. A blast of igni makes the metal glow, singeing flesh as the loops melt into a pair of cuffs. </p>\n<p> Nothing remains inside of Geralt except wrath. He takes the branch and drives it slowly into Cahir\u2019s abdomen. It misses every major organ and blood vessel, breaking through Cahir\u2019s back and burying itself in the blood-soaked ground without killing him. Geralt planned it that way. Cahir could survive for hours with the branch in his gut, and so he will. But every second will be agony as Yennefer\u2019s poison seeps out of the wood to circulate in his bloodstream. </p>\n<p> If the branch doesn\u2019t kill him, the poison will. If the poison doesn\u2019t kill him, the fire will. It sweeps towards them now, devouring corpses and woodland alike as it rages with a sorceress\u2019 power. No matter how it happens, Cahir will suffer. </p>\n<p> Geralt sees the defeat in his eyes. He turns on his heel. Cahir screams and pleads at his retreating back, but Geralt\u2019s mercy has blue eyes and waits for him on the other end of a portal, safe in the halls of Kaer Morhen. He returns to Jaskier's side and leaves Nilfgaard to burn.</p>\n<p>Yennefer meets them the second they walk through the portal. Eskel has Jaskier cradled in his arms, Lambert a step behind him. The others will join them soon enough. </p>\n<p> \u201cBring him to the sick room,\u201d Yennefer says, and they hasten to obey. Carrying Jaskier through the main hall makes Eskel want to retch. There\u2019s blood on him, and piss, and all sorts of other smells that have no business in his memories of their winters together, curled up in front of the fire with music in the air. Jaskier is supposed to be bright and loud in the ancient halls, not lying silent, still as stone. </p>\n<p> Eskel sets him down on the bed as gently as he can manage. The room is set up with everything Yennefer needs- tinctures and salves, miles of bandages, and some jars of potions that he knows better than to ask about. The sorceress herself sweeps into the room a moment later, worry written into the lines of her beautiful face. Magic leaps to her fingertips as she leans over Jaskier. </p>\n<p> There are whip marks, burns, and bruises. So much pain written across fair skin that Eskel wants to scream. It took them days to get to him. Days when he was enduring <em>this.</em> Imagining the death Cahir will suffer at Geralt\u2019s hands helps, but only so much. It doesn\u2019t make up for the whimper that pushes past Jaskier\u2019s teeth when Yennefer puts her hands on him. </p>\n<p> \u201cFuck,\u201d she says. \u201cHe can\u2019t be awake for this.\u201d Awake is a generous term for what Jaskier is, but Eskel understands. Healing, especially magical healing, can hurt as much as the wounds themselves. \u201cBlue bottle, cork top,\u201d Yennefer directs, \u201chand it over.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel finds the bottle by his elbow and pulls out the cork before pressing it to Yennefer\u2019s palm. She tips it into Jaskier\u2019s mouth. He grimaces a little as the liquid goes down, but he swallows it all and is out like a light seconds later, eyes shut and muscles completely slack against the bed. </p>\n<p> Scents of smoke and worry are heavy in the air, undercut by a fresh wave of rage as Geralt and Vesemir push through the door. Geralt\u2019s hands shake when his eyes fall on Jaskier- unmoving and unresponsive while Yennefer sets about cleaning his chest. In the low light of the room, Jaskier\u2019s body is still as death. </p>\n<p> \u201cIs he\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d Lambert says firmly. \u201cYennefer knocked him out.\u201d</p>\n<p> The breath leaves Geralt like a gut punch and he falls to his knees beside the bed, reaching out to feel for Jaskier\u2019s pulse. His eyes close when he finds it. It\u2019s weak, Eskel is sure, but there beneath his fingers all the same. </p>\n<p> \u201cCahir?\u201d Eskel asks. </p>\n<p> Thunderheads swirl in Vesemir\u2019s eyes. \u201cDead. By poison, fire, and steel. Geralt made sure of it.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt, the warrior. The Butcher. The White Wolf. </p>\n<p> Here, gently brushing sweat-soaked hair from Jaskier\u2019s forehead, he has never looked more like a man. Battle calloused hands trail down Jaskier\u2019s skin in a benediction and Eskel feels the last of his bloodlust leave him, exhaustion in its place as he drops to the floor by the bed. He reaches out to touch the top of Jaskier\u2019s foot- the only place he can reach with Yennefer bent over him- and the breath freezes in his throat. There are cuts on the bottom of his feet, dirty and half healed like he was made to stand on them again and again, never allowing the gashes to close. </p>\n<p> Eskel lets out a long groan. He wants to kill them all again, to re-light the fires and watch the men who did this burn. There, at least, he would be useful. But there is no one to slaughter, not anymore, and there is very little he can do to help with the healing. </p>\n<p> Yennefer changes focus from the cuts on Jaskier\u2019s chest to the ones scattered down his legs, but her elbow bumps against Eskel when she tries to move. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she says. \u201cThis room is too fucking small for six people, and I need <em>focus.</em> All of you except Vesemir, out.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWhy Vesemir?\u201d Lambert demands. </p>\n<p> \u201cBecause he has a level head and doesn\u2019t ask stupid questions. Now, go.\u201d When they seem reluctant to leave, she adds in a soft voice, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do for him now besides let me work. Go- I promise to summon you as soon as I\u2019m done.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAlright,\u201d Eskel says, \u201cwe\u2019ll go.\u201d His aching muscles complain as he stands. He hauls Geralt to his feet as well and moves them both outside. Geralt is dead weight in his arms, slumped against Eskel as he stares into the room. Yennefer shuts the door with a bang. </p>\n<p> Lambert comes up beside them and slings Geralt\u2019s arm over his shoulder, taking some of his weight. \u201cLet\u2019s go down to the hot spring.\u201d</p>\n<p> That seems to startle Geralt into awareness. His head jerks away from the door and shock glows in his eyes, mingling there with the hurt and worry that swirls like a storm through all three of them. \u201cYou want a fucking <em>bath</em> right now? Jaskier is- he\u2026\u201d The fight bleeds out of him and Geralt stumbles. \u201cI can\u2019t leave him here.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou can,\u201d Eskel says. His instincts scream at him not to walk away, not to leave Jaskier behind, but they\u2019ll only be in Yennefer\u2019s way if they stay. </p>\n<p> \u201cWe\u2019re covered in blood,\u201d Lambert points out. \u201cYou know how much he hates that. Do you want him to wake up to the three of us looking like we just climbed out of a selkiemore\u2019s stomach?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt stares at the door like it\u2019s personally responsible for keeping Jaskier away from him. His hands clench into a fist and relax again, so many emotions playing behind his eyes that Eskel can\u2019t keep up with them all. Finally, his shoulders slump and he turns away. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he grunts. </p>\n<p> They\u2019re all limping a little as they head to the spring, injuries, magic use, and plain old exhaustion catching up to them after hours of fighting. Eskel sways on his feet, so tired he could fall asleep standing, but he doesn\u2019t care. Jaskier is safe. He\u2019s safe, and he\u2019s whole, and no one will lay a finger on him ever again. Eskel will make sure of it.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Freshly washed and smelling of the lavender oil that Jaskier loves, three witchers take up a vigil outside the sick room door. Geralt fails miserably at meditating, focusing instead on the voices he can hear through the walls. Yennefer asks for gauze and potions, always with a snap in her voice, commanding and expecting to be obeyed. Not many people are willing to boss around Vesemir, but she manages quite well.</p>\n<p> Yennefer emerges hours later, nearly tripping over Lambert\u2019s foot when she slams open the door. Vesemir hovers over her shoulder, one hand out as if preparing to catch her. Dark circles hang heavy under her eyes. Her fingers shake from exhaustion as she points into the room, blood under her fingernails. \u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p> Relief crashes over Geralt, a wave of it so strong that it overcomes his usual need for stoicism and physical distance. He sweeps Yennefer into a hug, holding her long enough to mutter \u201cthank you\u201d in her ear before releasing her. She arches one perfectly lined eyebrow and gives him a smile as she waves him in. </p>\n<p> \u201cWatch the idiot for me, won\u2019t you? I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt sits gently on the edge of the bed, bracing himself on the ground so he doesn\u2019t disturb Jaskier. The blood and bruises are gone, replaced by a light flush over his cheekbones. He\u2019s still too thin, but the rest of him looks gloriously healthy, wounds wiped away like the entire horrific ordeal never happened. Beautiful. Jaskier is beautiful like this- strong and alive beneath the moonlight, safe in Geralt\u2019s arms. </p>\n<p> Lambert and Eskel follow him in, footsteps silent on the old wood floors. The bed is barely large enough for Jaskier, so there\u2019s no way for them all to get as close as they want to be, but they try anyway. Lambert sits on one corner of the pillow and runs his hands through Jaskier\u2019s hair while Eskel curls up by his feet, two fingers pressed against a blood vessel, taking a pulse as best he can. </p>\n<p> Vesemir stands in the corner, uncertain. He\u2019s as blood soaked as they were a few hours ago and even more tired. Geralt catches his eye and he clears his throat, coming forward slowly as though afraid they\u2019ll startle. He lifts the pendant over his head and drapes it around Jaskier\u2019s neck, fingers ghosting over the blush on one cheek before he pulls away. </p>\n<p> \u201cSpeak to him,\u201d Vesemir says. </p>\n<p> Geralt raises a hand to his own pendant, something bright taking form in his chest. \u201cDo you think he can hear us?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s powerful magic. A direct mental connection. Even if he can\u2019t understand the words, emotions and memories will go through.\u201d Vesemir\u2019s face is muted in the darkness, words on the tip of his tongue before he bites them back. \u201cGive him something to dream about. Something good.\u201d</p>\n<p> He\u2019s gone before Geralt can thank him. </p>\n<p> \u201cSomething good,\u201d Lambert echoes. His eyes close and his hands slow in Jaskier\u2019s hair. Geralt\u2019s pendant vibrates gently, a memory overtaking him. Lambert is in a field somewhere, Temeria, maybe, lit by the setting sun as he takes a rare break to simply <em>be.</em> No monsters, no fighting. Just a colorful sky and a lungful of clean air. </p>\n<p> The memory fades as the sun sets and a new one overtakes it. It\u2019s Eskel this time, bathing in a cold stream and grinning like a fool as silver fish dart around his legs. Then the fish are gone and Geralt sees the delight and surprise on a young woman\u2019s face when the witcher who rescued her plays a little tune on his lute. </p>\n<p> Geralt pushes his own memory down the bond. He\u2019s at a brothel, but not for sex. He take three women into a private room and has them teach him how to braid. They\u2019re suspicious at first, confused by a witcher of all people making such a request, but as the hours pass by without a sign of violence from Geralt, they relax into it. A redhead with hair down to her waist lets him practice on her- simple braids and complex ones, some with ribbons and gemstones woven in. He leaves the next morning with oddly sore fingers and a new skill that he puts to use on Roach\u2019s mane. His horse looks fucking ridiculous like that, but the smile it pulls from Jaskier is blinding.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Eskel laughs. </p>\n<p> \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p> A soft voice from the doorway asks, \u201cDid what?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt turns to his child surprise with fond exasperation. \u201cYou should be asleep, Ciri.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI wanted to see if Jaskier is okay. And if you all came back in one piece.\u201d She steps more fully into the room, moonlight bright on her determined face. A bouquet of wildflowers is clenched in one fist, clearly picked from the gardens out back, and she shoves them unceremoniously into Geralt\u2019s chest as she leans over to look at Jaskier. </p>\n<p> \u201cHe\u2019s fine, cub.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe are, too,\u201d Eskel says. </p>\n<p> Ciri eyes them all meaningfully as she pulls the flowers from Geralt\u2019s hand and starts tucking them into Jaskier\u2019s hair. \u201cDid you kill the bastards that took him?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt has long since stopped correcting her language. It would be hypocritical of him to tell her not to swear when he does it so often himself. Besides, curses always sound so much stronger when spoken in that delicate, royal tone of hers. </p>\n<p> Delight dances in Lambert\u2019s eyes. \u201cOf course we did.\u201d</p>\n<p> She nods, hands now empty of flowers, and solemnity takes over her expression. \u201cHe did it for me.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt\u2019s throat tightens up. If anyone deserves blame here it\u2019s him. For leaving Jaskier, for not thinking clearly about how many people know the White Wolf\u2019s bard. He doesn\u2019t want Ciri putting this on herself, not when it isn\u2019t her job to protect them. </p>\n<p> \u201cCiri-\u201c</p>\n<p> \u201cI know it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d She meets his eyes, and there is steel in her sharper than any sword. \u201cBut he did it for me. He got hurt to protect me.\u201d A quiet sigh escapes her lips and she sinks to the floor, curling towards Geralt like she has since the day he found her, seeking the protection that he has always offered. \u201cCan I stay here with you? Until he wakes up?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt pulls her close. It\u2019s easy to forget how much Jaskier means to Ciri. He\u2019s as much a father to her as the rest of them, a mentor in his own way, teaching her how to use words as effectively as Vesemir teaches her to wield a blade. \u201cYes. You can always stay with us.\u201d</p>\n<p> Ciri tucks her head into his shoulder and Geralt pushes the feeling of it through the pendant, trying to tell Jaskier that they\u2019re here. All of them, right here. Waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Jaskier wakes to thoughts of the sun. Golden rays and ocean air, memories not quite his own dragging him from sleep. His eyes flutter open and he breathes in deep. No aching in his ribs, no throbbing pain from the cuts oh his feet. His back still hurts, but it\u2019s nothing like before.</p>\n<p> He sits up and something soft falls onto his shoulder. A buttercup. Turning his head makes more flowers rain down on him, drifting from his hair to scatter across the bed. It must be a dream, he thinks. Quarter wood-elf or not, flowers don\u2019t just appear in people\u2019s hair. But if it is a dream, it\u2019s a damn good one. </p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s hand is on the pillow next to Jaskier, the rest of his body hanging off the bed in a way that cannot possibly be comfortable. Eskel is at his feet, looking much the same. And Geralt. Oh, <em>Geralt.</em> He\u2019s lying against one edge of the bed, Ciri in his arms, both of them asleep. Jaskier fights the exhaustion in his eyes to watch for as long as he can. To soak them in like this- his wolves around him and their lion cub between them. </p>\n<p> Jaskier takes the buttercup from his shoulder and tucks it behind Geralt\u2019s ear. A dream, yes. A beautiful one. But his body is tired and his eyes are heavy, so he gives in and lets sleep claim him once more.</p>\n<p>With a mixture of magic and potions, Yennefer keeps Jaskier asleep for two days. She may have sealed his wounds, but the body needs time to recover from such a shock, and the mind must adjust slowly to the sudden absence of pain. His room is never empty for long. No matter how often Yennefer reminds them that he won\u2019t wake, not without her there, Jaskier\u2019s witchers still hover around the bed as though their presence will ward off something terrible. </p>\n<p> Yennefer pities the poor bard when he does wake. Geralt\u2019s particular brand of stern protectiveness is wearying on the best of days. She can\u2019t imagine bearing the brunt of <em>four</em> smothering attitudes. </p>\n<p> Never mind the fact that she wants to smother him a little herself. Jaskier may be the most ridiculous human she has ever met, but he\u2019s kind. He treats Ciri like the queen she will one day be, and he takes care of Geralt in a way that it warms her heart to see. That kind of loyalty is worth protecting.</p>\n<p> On the morning of the third day, four anxious witchers stand at Yennefer\u2019s back as she tips a golden flask into Jaskier\u2019s mouth. The potion works instantly, bringing color back to Jaskier\u2019s sleep-pale cheeks. His eyes snap open. </p>\n<p> \u201cWelcome back, bard.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier pushes himself up with a shaky exhale. \u201cYennefer?\u201d He scrubs a hand down his face, vision blurring. \u201cWhere-\u201c</p>\n<p> She moves away and Jaskier barely has a second to adjust to his surroundings before his arms are full of Geralt, yellow eyes bright and nose tucked up under Jaskier\u2019s chin. He inhales deeply, going with ease when Eskel settles behind Jaskier to tug them both back. There are hands on Jaskier\u2019s shoulders- Vesemir\u2019s, he thinks- and arms around his waist, around his chest, soft lips against his neck from where Geralt is breathing him in, steady pressure on his thigh where Lambert is pressed close. Jaskier is half convinced he\u2019s still asleep. </p>\n<p> Their touch is a tide crashing towards him. Jaskier lets it carry him away. He leans into the wandering hands and tilts his head up so Geralt can scatter gentle kisses down his throat. His hands wind into someone\u2019s hair but he doesn\u2019t look to see whose, just shuts his eyes and holds on until the touches slow, until the thundering of his heart returns to its normal pulse. </p>\n<p> \u201cHello loves,\u201d he whispers. It comes out raspy and thick with the emotion that runs like fire through his veins. </p>\n<p> \u201c<em>Jaskier,\u201d</em> Geralt says. There\u2019s a color to his voice that Jaskier stores away to worry over later. Later, when he isn\u2019t so warm. So <em>held.</em></p>\n<p> \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p>\n<p> Someone squeezes his hand. Jaskier follows the line of an arm up to Vesemir\u2019s face, eyes focused on where his fingers are tangled with Jaskier\u2019s. \u201cKaer Morhen,\u201d he answers. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, well,\u201d Jaskier shifts and four sets of arms tighten around him. He\u2019s warm from the inside out. \u201cWith you four here, how could I not be?\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel lets out a broken sound, his hands gripping so hard at Jaskier\u2019s hips that it almost hurts before he notices and lightens up. \u201cWe weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier tugs on the hair his fist is tangled in- Lambert\u2019s. Memories of fire and knives trickle into his mind, clashing with the comfort Jaskier is wrapped in. \u201cAre they dead?\u201d</p>\n<p> He can\u2019t imagine he would be here if Cahir were still alive, but that does feel too good to be true. Surely this is a fever dream, a product of his overactive imagination spurned on by pain. Surely-</p>\n<p> \u201cThey\u2019re dead.\u201d </p>\n<p> All the breath leaves Jaskier in a rush and a desperate laugh falls from his lips. \u201cOh, gods.\u201d He chokes and someone works their thumb over his hip in little circles as he calms down. \u201cAll of them? How? Cahir-\u201c</p>\n<p> \u201cFire,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cAnd poison.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd steel,\u201d Geralt adds. </p>\n<p> There is a beat of silence as Jaskier absorbs this. Then- \u201cI cut Iddeld\u2019s cock off.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert says it without inflection or feeling, but the shock of it startles a laugh out of Jaskier all the same. A real one this time.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood. The bastard deserved it.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt makes a noise against his skin that sounds like agreement. They fall back into quiet and Jaskier basks in it. He can\u2019t smell metal or blood anymore, just lavender oil and the slightly ripe scent of himself after who knows how long lying in bed. Jaskier would be happy to rest there forever, safe in a fortress of witchers, but a loud grumble from his stomach breaks the calm. </p>\n<p> \u201cShit,\u201d Eskel says, \u201cyou haven\u2019t eaten in days.\u201d</p>\n<p> Now that someone says it aloud, Jaskier feels the pit in his stomach. Cahir didn\u2019t feed him much. Even if he did, Jaskier probably would have thrown it up. But here, now that losing his life isn\u2019t an immediate concern, his hunger makes itself known. </p>\n<p> \u201cThere\u2019s fresh bread in the kitchens,\u201d Vesemir says. \u201cCiri and I made it this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cPerfect.\u201d Jaskier tries to extricate himself from the pile of limbs around him, but none of the men holding him close are willing to let go. \u201cFood now,\u201d he argues, \u201ccuddles later.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel makes that broken sound again and hearing it cleaves Jaskier\u2019s heart in half. It\u2019s the same noise Jaskier makes when Geralt comes back from fighting something in the woods covered in blood- some of it his, some of it the monster\u2019s. Jaskier can never tell the difference. He panics the same regardless. </p>\n<p> He\u2019s sure he doesn\u2019t want to know what he looked like when they found him. Cahir spilled more of his blood in those few days than Jaskier knew he possessed. There will be scars. Up and down his body, everywhere he was touched with a blade or a hot iron. Jaskier fears the moment when he\u2019ll have to see himself. If he\u2019s afraid now, mostly healed, how must it have felt for Eskel and the others to see him when the wounds were fresh? </p>\n<p> Jaskier lets the tension bleed from his limbs and turns just far enough to drop a kiss on Eskel\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he says firmly. </p>\n<p> Those words unlock something in his witchers, like they were waiting for assurance before letting go. Vesemir squeezes his hand once more before moving aside and Eskel and Lambert pull away, though Jaskier\u2019s back is still pressed to Eskel\u2019s front. Geralt slides off the bed and works a hand under Jaskier\u2019s legs. </p>\n<p> \u201cGeralt, what-\u201c</p>\n<p> Jaskier squeaks as Geralt lifts him, sheets and all, from the bed, holding him with one arm under Jaskier\u2019s legs and the other supporting his shoulders. Any protests Jaskier might have had die on his lips when Geralt kisses him. It\u2019s a reassuring kiss, all steady pressure and heat. He drops his head to Geralt\u2019s shoulders when they break away. </p>\n<p> \u201cAre you going to mother hen me all day?\u201d Jaskier asks, and Geralt kisses him again. That means <em>yes,</em> but it also means <em>I love you,</em> so Jaskier shuts up and lets himself be carried.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The table is piled high with bread and sweets, fresh vegetables from the garden and meat from the deer Vesemir brought down last week. Geralt makes Jaskier eat slowly, putting things on his plate when it\u2019s empty, watching him with the single- minded intensity of a hunt. The others strike up an easy conversation and Vesemir takes the opportunity to slip away. He will join the revelry later. Now, there is a job to be done.</p>\n<p> There is a carving deep in the recesses of Vesemir\u2019s closet- an exact replica of his wolf medallion that he whittled out of boredom last winter. Instantly recognizable but without any real power, it is precisely what he needs. He tucks the carving into his back pocket along with a simple chain and goes to find Yennefer. </p>\n<p> Her door is open when he arrives. He takes the invitation and goes inside, closing the door with a soft click. Yennefer sits before her vanity, hair half up in a complex twist. </p>\n<p> \u201cI knew you would come,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p> Vesemir nods. There is not much she does not know. \u201cI have need of you.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, you witchers always do.\u201d She meets his gaze in the mirror, looking past the lingering rage that rests heavy on his brow to the plans hidden in his eyes. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cA portal,\u201d Vesemir says, \u201cand some new clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>His hands shake as he grips the hem of his shirt. A quick tug has it up and over his head, yet Jaskier\u2019s eyes remain shut. The mirror he stands in front of will show him nothing good. Nothing beautiful. It would hurt him less to turn away and ignore it, but he has to know. Has to <em>see.</em></p>\n<p> He sucks in a breath and opens on the exhale. His eyes are the first thing he sees, blue as ever. Then he trails downward, taking in the thin white lines that crisscross his chest. They\u2019re faded, as if the wounds that birthed them were inflicted decades ago instead of mere days. The burn marks are worse. One long line runs from his left knee to his hip, the skin there streaked and pink like something twisted it out of place and put it back wrong. </p>\n<p> Jaskier runs his hands down his chest in a slow drag. There are bumps and ridges where there used to be smooth skin. He reaches for the burn but bile rises in his throat before he can touch it. It\u2019s imperfect. Unnatural. Geralt wears his scars like a warrior, but these make Jaskier look weak. He feels torn apart, and no stronger for it. </p>\n<p> It\u2019s a blessing when he tugs on a clean pair of trousers. The silk is cool against him and he can almost, <em>almost,</em> convince himself that the skin beneath it is as pure as before. Almost, but not quite. He is broken. He is forever changed, forever dirtied by Cahir\u2019s fire. </p>\n<p> He shrugs on the rest of his clothes and nearly runs form the mirror, determined to ignore the scars for as long as destiny will allow. </p>\n<p> But when has destiny ever been kind to Jaskier?</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt insists they make their way down to the hot spring after lunch. Most of the blood has been cleaned from Jaskier\u2019s skin, but the stink of days without a proper bath hangs heavy around him. It mingles with the sour scent of lingering pain that Cahir drove so deep into his pores. Geralt can\u2019t stand the smell of it, and even if he could, the water would do Jaskier good.</p>\n<p> Darkness engulfs them in the spring, broken only by light filtering underneath the door and the flame of Geralt\u2019s candle. He pulls off his own clothes easily and slides into the water with a sigh. He\u2019s here with Jaskier. Safe and warm and about to be gloriously naked. Geralt knows better than to try for anything right now, but he still craves the sight of Jaskier\u2019s body, free of blood and blemish, tucked up tight against Geralt\u2019s chest. </p>\n<p> Jaskier strips methodically. He sinks into the pool faster than usual, hurrying where he would normally linger to let Geralt look his fill. One of the others set out Jaskier\u2019s favorite soaps a few hours ago and he reaches for them now, scrubbing and lathering without so much as a glance over his shoulder. </p>\n<p> That won\u2019t do. Geralt moves up to him, silent as he glides through the water, and replaces Jaskier\u2019s hands with his own. He\u2019s careful to keep his touch undemanding- not taking, simply offering his help and enjoying the feel of smooth muscle under his fingertips. They do this often enough that he expects Jaskier to melt back into his touch. Instead, Jaskier goes rigid, breaths short as he tenses but refuses to move away. </p>\n<p> Were anyone else to react that way, Geralt would pull away. But he knows Jaskier- the man takes loss of contact as rejection. So Geralt spreads his palm flat across Jaskier\u2019s stomach, soap forgotten, and kisses the shell of his ear. </p>\n<p> \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAbout what, love?\u201d Jaskier\u2019s voice is too bright, too loud in the still of the spring. Geralt frowns and rubs circles into Jaskier\u2019s skin with his thumb. That gesture can be relied upon to turn Jaskier into a pile of mush on most days, but now it only seems to wind him up further. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d Jaskier sniffs and shoots Geralt a weak smile. \u201cExcept I stink to high heaven, so if you would kindly return the soap to me\u2026?\u201d He holds out his palm expectantly. </p>\n<p> Of all his odd behavior, this one is the worst. Jaskier <em>loves</em> to talk about his feelings. Loves it even more when Geralt asks, when <em>Geralt</em> is the one to begin a conversation about something other than monsters or their next meal. For him to stray away from talking now is of greater concern than the newfound tension in his body. </p>\n<p> He hands over the soap in silence and watches. Geralt has always thought words were useless. Too easy to lie, too easy to omit. Action is honest. A desperate man will glance to his treasure. A violent man\u2019s hand will always drift to his weapon. </p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s hands work soap over his body with an efficiency he rarely possesses. He\u2019s quick and perfunctory for the most part, but he scrubs slightly too hard at a few spots. A line down his leg and a section of his shoulder blade get the worst of it- rubbed raw as Jaskier looks at anything besides his own body or Geralt. </p>\n<p> The truth, when it clicks, is horrific. So simple yet so <em>wrong.</em></p>\n<p> Scrubbing finished, Jaskier dunks under the water. Geralt catches him as he rises, one hand unyielding on Jaskier\u2019s chest and another wrapped around his thigh, moving him backwards until he\u2019s completely flush against Geralt. He tries to turn, indignant, and opens his mouth to tell Geralt off. It plops shut at the touch of two fingers to a pink spot on his shoulder blade. </p>\n<p> Geralt wants to tell him that he\u2019s gorgeous. Scars or not. Jaskier is all bravery and fire and sweet, aching kindness that lives in an untouchable soul, far beneath anything that can be burned by an iron. But he has tried to say such things before, and the words never fail to come out garbled, more insulting than complimentary, and certainly not beautiful. A more forceful approach is required here- one that will get Jaskier out of his labyrinthine mind. </p>\n<p> \u201cDo you think less of me, for mine?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat?\u201d Jaskier squirms against Geralt\u2019s hold in a way that both of them know is useless. He tries anyway. \u201cGeralt, would you just let me-\u201c</p>\n<p> Geralt silences him with a hand on his hip, dragging down the burn that mars his skin. \u201cMy scars. Do you think less of me for them?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, of course I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDo they make me less of a man?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier makes a wounded noise low in his throat. \u201c<em>No,</em> Geralt, no. How many times do I have to tell you-\u201c</p>\n<p> Lips meet skin behind Jaskier\u2019s ear. Geralt\u2019s hand makes its way back up Jaskier\u2019s thigh and dances over a thin scar just below his left nipple. He trails openmouthed kisses down Jaskier\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p> \u201cDo they make me less beautiful?\u201d</p>\n<p> Those are Jaskier\u2019s words, not Geralt\u2019s. Geralt would never presume to call his hulking figure \u201cbeautiful\u201d- he\u2019s too gnarled for such a gentle word- but Jaskier loves to use it, whispering praises like silk and honey against whatever part of Geralt he can reach every time they make love.</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d Jaskier breathes. </p>\n<p> \u201cThen why presume any different about yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201c<em>Geralt\u2026</em>\u201d Jaskier\u2019s voice cracks, but he stops trying to pull away. \u201cYou got yours in battle,\u201d he mutters, \u201cit\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p> This ridiculous, blind fool. His poet\u2019s eyes miss so much. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou got yours protecting Ciri,\u201d Geralt corrects. \u201cFighting for your life and hers, even unarmed. I think that makes us very much the same.\u201d</p>\n<p> No verbal answer meets his words, but Geralt does not need one to know his words struck home. Jaskier\u2019s body falls heavy against his own and Geralt holds him up, skin to skin and soul to soul as Jaskier shakes apart, turning to bury his sobs in Geralt\u2019s shoulder. They stand together until the grief crests, falling back into the waters of Jaskier\u2019s mind as if it were never there at all. </p>\n<p> It will return. It will try to drown Jaskier in memory and fear, and it will be his task to beat it back. Geralt will be there to hold him as he does.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>A portal spins open above the scorched earth of what used to be a Nilfgaardian war camp. From it steps a man, plain to the untrained eye, yet dripping in magic to those who know how to look. He walks to the center of the ashen field, bends to rummage in the dirt for a moment, and plunges a sword deep into the ground. Around the hilt he ties a carving. It is a simple thing- it\u2019s message clear.</p>\n<p> The man slings his traveler\u2019s pack over one shoulder and sets off for the nearest town, leaving behind him the stench of death and scorched bodies. Over the carnage rules the sword. The carving. The wolf. </p>\n<p> He makes it to town by nightfall. No one gives the stranger more than a cursory glance as he settles in at the local tavern and orders a pint. Townsfolk chatter and the man listens, waiting. Gossip and complaint. The usual. Nothing useful is said until the bartender begins to hum a familiar tune. </p>\n<p> \u201cI know that one,\u201d the man says. \u201cCatchy song.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, yes.\u201d She sighs as she fills a tankard of ale and pushes it down the table to another customer. \u201cI hear the bard who sings it travels with a <em>witcher.</em> Can you imagine? I bet that\u2019s why his ballads are so exciting.\u201d</p>\n<p> The man hums into his drink, then leans forward conspiratorially. He speaks with the stage whisper of a gossip who intends to be overheard but does not intend to admit it. \u201cHave you seen the camp nearby lately? The Nilfgaardians?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThose bastards! I haven\u2019t seen hide nor hair of them since three days ago and I\u2019m damn glad to say it. They\u2019re nothin\u2019 but trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p> Her declaration draws nods from nearby patrons. An audience. \u201cAye,\u201d says the man, \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen them lately \u2018cause they\u2019re dead.\u201d</p>\n<p> Gasps percolate through the room. Every ear in the tavern is tilted towards the stranger. \u201cDead?\u201d the barkeep echoes.</p>\n<p> \u201cBurned to the ground. I walked past their camp on my way here. Just passing by, mind, hoping to find work further north, and there it is- a field of ash. Wouldn\u2019t have known it was anything but ash if I hadn\u2019t seen the bones.\u201d</p>\n<p> Another patron jumps into the conversation, his curious eyes fastened on the man\u2019s face. \u201cWhat happened to them all?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cCan\u2019t be sure,\u201d the man says, and he weighs his next words carefully. \u201cBut I hear one of \u2018em laid hands on the White Wolf\u2019s bard. Some soldier brought him back to that camp like a captive and got killed for his troubles.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo way,\u201d says the barkeep, but there\u2019s uncertainty in her eyes. \u201cOne man couldn\u2019t bring down a whole troop of soldiers, witcher or no.\u201d</p>\n<p> The man raises his tankard and takes a long drag, letting the tension build. \u201cI though the same thing at first,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then I got to thinking. S\u2019pose there were more than one of \u2018em? Witchers, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p> The idea lodges itself deep in mortal minds. It twists and grows, turning concept into fact and fact into legend. The man sees it take root and drives the final nail into the coffin. </p>\n<p> \u201cSee for yourselves if you like. One of \u2018em left his sword in the field, that wolf symbol some of them wear tied to it. I didn\u2019t want to touch the damn thing, \u2018course, but you can go look at it. Nothing but a witcher would leave something like that lying around, and a damn angry one at that.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAye,\u201d agrees the patron who spoke earlier, \u201cwe\u2019ll send someone out at first light. If the bastards really are gone, we\u2019ll throw a damn feast.\u201d</p>\n<p> The stranger laughs. \u201cGood on you. Invite that bard, maybe.\u201d His smile takes the edge off the suggestion and he takes another swig of ale before joking, \u201cJust be careful not to touch him, or the witcher\u2019ll get you.\u201d</p>\n<p> His barkeep shudders and tops off his pint. The conversation drifts to safer topics, ones less likely to wake men with nightmares, but the man can feel the weight of his rumor in the air. The people will send a rider the next morning, and they will find exactly what he described. She will ride back into town with hell at her heels, spinning tales of death and destruction, holding high the carving of a wolf. Rumors will spin out of control until the troop of soldiers is a battalion, until the fire burns so hot that even the bones are ash, until the witchers that fell on the camp are more beast than man. But that\u2019s alright. Because at the center of every rumor, no matter how truthful, will be a message; The bard is not to be touched. </p>\n<p> The man rents a room for the night and slips away before dawn. He wanders down the road far enough to make sure he has not been followed before pulling the charm from his neck and summoning the sorceress who put it there. A portal flares to life before him, mountain winds whistling through to tousle the hair of a different man than stood there moments ago. A stronger man. A witcher. </p>\n<p> Vesemir returns home, content.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>When his witchers finally decide to release some of their nervous energy with sparring, Jaskier follows Ciri to the gardens. He has never been to Kaer Morhen during the summer months before, and is overjoyed to see bunches of wildflowers blooming bright against the mountain soil. Ciri pulls him onto a patch of grass and drops her head in his lap, demanding braids. Jaskier is all too happy to oblige.</p>\n<p> \u201cI missed you, little lion,\u201d he says. \u201cHas Yennefer been treating you well?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes.\u201d Ciri tilts her head back a little to look at him. Jaskier doesn\u2019t know when it happened, but maturity has snuck into her face. Her cheekbones are sharper, her eyes more thoughtful. It is the face of a woman more than a girl, though she is not yet fully grown. \u201cI missed you, too. I always do when you and Geralt leave.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier shoots her a pleased grin, but it falters at the seriousness in her expression. \u201cCiri? What\u2019s wrong, love?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI know what you did,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI know you did it for me.\u201d </p>\n<p> His hands fiddle with her hair, braiding and unbraiding as he tries to think of the right words. To tell her he loves her, that he would do anything for her, but also to beg her not to ask, not to push for information from such a recent wound. </p>\n<p> \u201cI did. And I would do it again, Ciri, if it kept you safe. So you mustn\u2019t blame yourself for anything that happened to me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI know. I don\u2019t.\u201d She sits up all the way and fixes Jaskier with a glare that rivals Vesemir\u2019s in sheer ferocity. \u201cSomeday, I will be a queen. And then <em>I</em> will protect <em>you.</em> How about that?\u201d</p>\n<p> He doesn\u2019t doubt it. Looks forward to it, in fact. \u201cI think that sounds lovely, my dear. What a leader you will make someday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Eskel practically drags him to the kitchen that night. Hardly an hour passes that Jaskier isn\u2019t under the eye of one witcher or another, but he knows they need to see him alive and whole. However overdone it may be, their protectiveness is sweet. So Jaskier goes happily and helps cook. It\u2019s quiet. Relaxing. Into the peace between them, Eskel speaks.</p>\n<p> \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier nearly drops his knife. He turns from the rabbit he was skinning to try to meet Eskel\u2019s eyes, but the other man is resolutely facing away. A tick flutters in his jaw and he says, \u201cI realized that I never said the words. I figured you knew,\u201c he waves his hand in Jaskier\u2019s direction as if to say <em>obviously</em>, \u201cbut I never said it. And then Cahir-\u201c He finally looks in Jaskier\u2019s face, something desperate and wild hidden behind his expression. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand myself if you- if I never said it. I love you, Jaskier, so much it scares me sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p> There\u2019s rabbit blood on his hands, but he doesn\u2019t think Eskel will mind. Jaskier pulls his close, one hand reaching out to hold the back of his head and thread fingers through his hair. \u201cI love you too,\u201d Jaskier says, \u201cand I plan on continuing to do so for many, many decades my friend. War camps and Nilfgaard be damned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The day winds to a close with joy in the halls. Jaskier takes up his lute after dinner and plays for the first time since Nilfgaard, delighted when Yennefer teaches them all a dance from her time at court. Their fire is bright and Jaskier\u2019s heart is so, <em>so</em> full.</p>\n<p> Ciri tires before the rest of them and Yennefer brings her upstairs to the room they share. Jaskier feels the call of sleep not soon after. His wounds may be closed, but days of trauma and starvation took their toll on his stamina. Geralt tugs the lute from his hands when his eyes begin to droop. One look between the witchers and an agreement is reached. They head for the large room down the hall- the one with a bed large enough to fit them all, their regular sleeping quarters for the winter. </p>\n<p> Lambert starts up a fire while Geralt and Eskel clamber into bed. Normally, Jaskier would already be between them, soaking up as much warmth as possible. Instead, he heads to the door and the shadow that stands just beyond it. </p>\n<p> \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you all day,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p> \u201cHad something to take care of,\u201d Vesemir answers. </p>\n<p> Jaskier tilts his head, considering. \u201cAnd is it taken care of?\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir nods. \u201cIt is.\u201d He lifts Jaskier\u2019s hand and drops a chain into his open palm. Its magic sparks to life, singing through his veins like the songbird it is contained within. </p>\n<p> It doesn\u2019t matter who wears which necklace, not to the magic anyway, but this one feels more like Jaskier\u2019s than the one around his neck. He lifts that chain from his head and drops it around Vesemir instead before uncoiling the necklace in his hand and putting it on. Jaskier can feel all four of them through the magic, through the bond they share, no longer unbalanced by Vesemir\u2019s absence. </p>\n<p> Sleep tugs at his limbs and Jaskier turns back to his room, already anticipating the sturdy weight of his bedfellows. It really is his favorite way to sleep. The three of them wait for him, he knows, and yet\u2026</p>\n<p> He reaches out towards Vesemir\u2019s back, beckoning as he retreats down the hallway. \u201cCome to bed, you old bastard,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir pivots slowly on one heel, yet brokers no protest as Jaskier pulls him into the room. Lambert\u2019s fire blazes in the hearth, Lambert himself sprawled shirtless beside it. Jaskier expected at least a few raised eyebrows at Vesemir\u2019s presence, but the others take it in stride, shifting around to make space for two more bodies in the already crowded bed. </p>\n<p> Jaskier melts into it with a sigh. He\u2019ll wake up in the morning with a crick in his neck, or tingles up his arm from where it was trapped under another man\u2019s chest. The room will be hot, too hot, from so much body heat, and Jaskier will have a light sheen of sweat over him for most of the morning. But right now he has Geralt\u2019s arm thrown over his collarbone and Vesemir strewn against his front, Lambert curled up behind him and Eskel resting heavy on his lower half, and this, Jaskier thinks, is perfect. It\u2019s perfect.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The bard is alone outside the tavern, resting from a long performance. It smells of spring and night air- nothing like the piss, ale, and sex of the tavern\u2019s patrons. A figure slips out after the bard, a knife in his hand. He means to cut the bard\u2019s purse strings and run, to cut the bard himself if he must. But he hears snatches of the song the bard is humming, and he remembers something. A whisper. A rumor repeated too far and too wide to be entirely false.</p>\n<p> They say a soldier laid hands on the White Wolf\u2019s bard. They say he lost his hands and thousands of his men as well, ripped to shreds by an army of witchers and their magic, torn asunder and sent to the deepest pits of hell to rot forever. All over one man. One man who travels the continent singing of the Wolf and his adventures, composing and performing ballads with catchy, painfully familiar tunes. </p>\n<p> He knows not if this is the same bard as the one the stories speak of, but it matters little in the face of a witcher\u2019s wrath. The knife glints as the figure returns it to his cloak and retreats. There are easier places to find coin this night. </p>\n<p> A few feet away, ears tuned to the sound of shuffling footsteps even beneath his humming, Jaskier faces the night and smiles.</p>"
