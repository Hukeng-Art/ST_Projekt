  "text": "<p>Clark waited patiently throughout the Justice League meeting as various members relayed status updates from their realms of protection, but Clark could have guessed what each update would be based on recent events and the general moods of every member.</p>\n<p>Nothing new. Carry on.</p>\n<p>But of course, they had to keep up appearances and run through the planned meeting agenda that Batman always put painstaking effort into as the resident control freak. Clark typically found B\u2019s workaholic nature to be endearing, but sometimes, he wished the man would relax for once.</p>\n<p>Then finally, <em>finally</em>, the key item of the day\u2019s meeting arrived: nominations to join the League.</p>\n<p>The last person who joined up was Victor Stone, aka Cyborg, who had been nominated and appointed about a year prior by Diana, and his status on the team had turned out to be a godsend. It allowed Batman to take a step back from the technical aspects of the Watchtower and missions which, selfishly, allowed Clark to spend more time with the mysterious vigilante on watch duty, missions, and even downtime.</p>\n<p>Yeah, Clark had been surprised, to say the least, when Batman accepted dinner with him, even if it was after watch duty and they hadn\u2019t left the Watchtower. And the one time that he had accepted a piece of pie that Ma Kent had baked, even if he didn\u2019t let them eat it in the monitor room. But baby steps, right?</p>\n<p>Anyway, Clark already had a hero in mind to nominate next, and he knew it would let Batman ease off even more on some of his duties. He also had a selfish desire to meet the hero considering his name was derived from a Kryptonian legend.</p>\n<p>Batman asked if anyone had any nominations.</p>\n<p>\u201cNightwing,\u201d both Barry and Clark chimed in.</p>\n<p>They both startled and looked at each other. Where Clark looked surprised, Barry beamed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you know him, too?\u201d Barry said. \u201cGreat! Thought I\u2019d be the only one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is this Nightwing?\u201d J\u2019onn asked, looking between the two curiously.</p>\n<p>Victor spoke before Clark or Barry could, answering, \u201cThe leader of the Titans, my old team. He operates out of Bl\u00fcdhaven when not with the Titans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he does good work?\u201d Diana asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWally talks about him all the time,\u201d Barry said, leaning back in his chair as he drummed his fingers on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much of it is due to them being best friends, but Wally\u2019s described him as their generation\u2019s Batman.\u201d Clark and a few others threw curious glances at Batman who didn\u2019t react. \u201cApparently, he\u2019s got the respect of everyone their age and absolutely refuses to tell anyone his identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good at what he does,\u201d Victor said, looking at Diana without the excitability of Barry.</p>\n<p>As he spoke, he shared a set of footage to each of their personal monitors, displaying a video of a well-muscled young man in a skin-tight black and blue suit taking down a group of gangsters with swift ease. The footage shifted to that of a clip showcasing Nightwing working alongside Troia and Tempest in New York. The way he moved in tandem with Troia\u2019s lasso reminded Clark of Batman and Wonder Woman.</p>\n<p>Victor continued, \u201cAlways has a plan, good at improvisation, an amazing fighter, skilled hacker, all while being completely human.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, that blew Clark\u2019s secret hope of Nightwing being a secluded Kryptonian refugee out of the water, but oh well. He still thought Nightwing might be a good fit.</p>\n<p>Hal chuckled. \u201cSounds like Spooky alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know of him, Kal?\u201d Diana asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wrote an article about him a few weeks ago as part of the Planet\u2019s spotlight on vigilantes,\u201d Clark answered. \u201cBl\u00fcdhaven is Gotham\u2019s sister city. Word is it\u2019s worse than Gotham when it comes to crime rates and corruption all without the economic bustle or the eccentric rogue gallery that Gotham has. And Nightwing is the only vigilante there trying to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>It helped that the whole reason Nightwing caught his attention in the first place was the name. Clark liked the Nightwing and Flamebird story, but he supposed it was possible that Nightwing had gotten the name from something else. It wasn\u2019t as though putting together the words \u201cnight\u201d and \u201cwing\u201d for a vigilante that worked at night and liked to jump from buildings required much imagination. Clark could dream though.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to knock your investigative skills, Clark,\u201d Arthur cut in, \u201cbut if the guy\u2019s that busy with his own city, why would he want to join us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if he does accept, do we need another person who does the exact same thing as Batman?\u201d Hawkwoman asked. \u201cOr Green Arrow, for that matter. Every other member of the League has an individual skillset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to have members with similar skills,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt would also mean we\u2019re not always relying on B to make the plans.\u201d He had a teasing lilt in his words as he glanced at Batman with a small smile.</p>\n<p>Diana smirked at the teasing even if Batman didn\u2019t react, much to Clark\u2019s dismay.</p>\n<p>Batman did, however, choose then to speak up. \u201cWith Nightwing being the leader of the Titans, he wouldn\u2019t be able to fully dedicate his time to obligations for the League. Anyone else that can be nominated?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clark frowned at Batman\u2019s quick dismissal of the Bl\u00fcdhaven vigilante. It wasn\u2019t as though Clark could infer why either. Due to the cowl and Batman\u2019s general stoic demeanor, it made it nearly impossible for anyone to tell what Batman was thinking or feeling, so Clark had no idea what he truly thought about Nightwing. Had he been annoyed the entire time or only when Flash compared the two? Was Batman\u2019s obligation argument the only thing he had against Nightwing, or did he have other criticisms, such as not wanting another person like him around?</p>\n<p>Clark had no idea, yet he also had no plans to argue.</p>\n<p>But Diana did.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, wait a minute, Batman,\u201d Diana said before anyone could answer his inquiry. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be the only League member to have outside obligations. Simply because it is another team rather than a people should not disqualify him from the running. I often have obligations to the Amazons, and everyone is understanding. Same with Arthur for the Atlanteans or you to Gotham. I, for one, would be happy to have this Nightwing on the team with Victor and Wally\u2019s high praise of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clark noticed the happy tilt of Barry\u2019s head at the mention of his nephew, but he also noticed the mild twitch of Batman\u2019s jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, aside from Nightwing,\u201d Clark moved the conversation along, \u201canyone have any other names they\u2019d like to put forward?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were thinking Red Tornado,\u201d Hawkman said, gesturing to himself and his wife. \u201cBut that would require a way to contact him first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start working on it for the next round of nominees,\u201d Hawkwoman assured.</p>\n<p>\u201cBooster Gold seems interesting,\u201d Hal chimed in, though he was only half paying attention.</p>\n<p>Oliver let out a sharp laugh. \u201cNo thanks. I think we have our fill of arrogance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t much of a team player,\u201d Dinah agreed. \u201cSeems too interested in fame and recognition than making a difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we need someone to lighten the mood,\u201d Hal joked, shooting a look in Batman\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s eyebrows twitched at the quiet dig at Batman. \u201cAlright, any other serious nominations?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hal dramatically gaped at him, placing a hand over his heart as if saying \u2018I am serious, Supes,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t say anything aloud at Clark\u2019s stern gaze.</p>\n<p>When no one else moved to put forward other names, Diana nodded and said, \u201cIf anyone has concerns bring them forth now. Otherwise, everyone for Nightwing\u2019s appointment to the League, raise your hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clark watched as a majority of the team raised their hands, excluding Hawkwoman, Hawkman, and Batman, the last of whom was a disappointment to see. But with ten out of thirteen Justice League members for Nightwing joining the team, it was set. The majority ruled when no major concerns were set forth.</p>\n<p>After that, Batman, begrudgingly by the look of his tense movements, placed Nightwing on the temporary roster, pending acceptance, and it made Clark increasingly curious as to why he was against Nightwing. If he had something against Nightwing, Clark would gladly take it into consideration, as would the others, but other than the Titans obligation, Batman had offered nothing.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was something personal? As much as Clark didn\u2019t want to think it had to do with their secret identities, if Batman refused to discuss it then it was increasingly likely that that was the case.</p>\n<p>Once the meeting officially concluded, Clark, Barry, and Victor headed to Bl\u00fcdhaven together to give the news and official invitation to Nightwing.</p>\n<p>Finding him was easy. They stood on a rooftop together, and five minutes later, Nightwing popped up behind them. If Clark didn\u2019t have superhearing, and thus heard his heartbeat, he would\u2019ve jumped in alarm the way both Barry and Victor did.</p>\n<p>\u201cCy, hey!\u201d Nightwing immediately greeted with a large grin and open arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cRob, been a while,\u201d Victor greeted in return, accepting the hug. \u201cHow\u2019s the team?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing patted him roughly on the back before stepping back and pointing at him accusingly. \u201cI know you read the group chat, you lurker.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Rob?</em> Clark thought over. Since Nightwing didn\u2019t say anything about the supposed reveal of a civilian identity, Clark only grew more curious. He supposed it was a nickname that was removed enough from his real name for plausible deniability, since it could be Robert, Robinson, Robel, etc. But something about it itched at Clark\u2019s mind. Like he should know more about it than he did.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the name, Clark was pleased to see a vigilante be so open, smiley, and friendly, who could also clearly be silent and dangerous. He was also quite young, in his mid-twenties at the oldest if Clark had to try and pin it down. The black and blue suit left little to the imagination but also favored a light and agile approach that heavier, thicker fabrics and protections wouldn\u2019t have allowed, like with Batman\u2019s Kevlar-titanium suit that favored anti-ballistic protection rather than speed. Nightwing\u2019s mask also offered no practical protection other than concealing his identity.</p>\n<p>The consensus between Barry and Victor had been that Nightwing was like Batman, but that wasn\u2019t quite the case. At least, not completely. Not in a way one would expect.</p>\n<p>Nightwing looked between the three Leaguers, and asked, \u201cWhat, no Batsy?\u201d Clark heard the slight disappointment in his voice and spotted the pout of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said he had business to attend to in Gotham,\u201d Victor said.</p>\n<p>A quiet snort left Nightwing as he seemed to roll his eyes beneath the white lenses of his domino mask. \u201cDoubtful.\u201d Before any of the three could ask what Nightwing meant, he waved his hand. \u201cAnyway, what can I do for the League? At least, that\u2019s what I assume you\u2019re here about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to extend an official invitation for you to join the Justice League,\u201d Clark said, lifting his chin and keeping a professional tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d Nightwing asked, expression pinching. \u201cReally? Me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurns out, the Titans aren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019ve heard about your dumb ass, Robbie,\u201d Victor joked, chuckling. \u201cBoth Flash and Superman put your name forward.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing then asked, \u201cAnd Batman agreed to this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d Barry said, voice strained. \u201cHe was tight-lipped about why, but he wasn\u2019t in favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to go into the specifics of who voted in favor and who didn\u2019t,\u201d Clark cut in. While he wanted to ask more about the mystery that was Nightwing and Batman\u2019s relationship, it also wasn\u2019t the time for it. \u201cAs of now, you have a standing invitation to join the League. This would come with all the privileges and benefits, including but not limited to Justice League headquarters and direct lines to the other members if you need backup.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing didn\u2019t seem to be fully listening to Clark\u2019s spiel as he looked into the distance. In the direction of Gotham City.</p>\n<p>Hm, curiouser and curiouser.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Nightwing said, mind and tone distant. He focused on the three again. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own team to worry about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barry waved the concern away. \u201cWonder Woman said that\u2019d be alright. A lot of the team has other priorities, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? It\u2019s not an all-or-nothing type deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m certain we could make things work,\u201d Clark told him. \u201cEveryone on the team is a leader or protector of some kind. Everyone has their own cities or people. A superhero team isn\u2019t much different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing looked in the direction of Gotham City once again, and Clark wanted nothing more than to know what was racing through his mind.</p>\n<p>Was he seeking Batman\u2019s approval? Was he wanting to piss Batman off? Was he wanting to avoid Batman altogether? Was he worrying about any consequences that would arise if he joined the League?</p>\n<p>Finally, Nightwing slowly nodded and looked at the three Leaguers again. \u201cAlright, yeah, okay,\u201d he said, shifting his weight between his legs. \u201cI\u2019d be honored to join.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Barry exclaimed. \u201cWally talks about you often, so I just know this is gonna go great.\u201d</p>\n<p>After they relayed the time and date for the next meeting, as well as how to access the Zeta tubes to go up to the Watchtower to even attend his official welcome, they parted ways.</p>\n<p>Nightwing remained on the rooftop, watching as Cyborg, Superman, and Flash all left, but as Clark flew into the sky, he heard Nightwing mutter to himself, \u201cKnow a guy for seventeen years: doesn\u2019t bother to stop by with his friends. Lame. Screw you too, B. Maybe I\u2019ll just skip dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clark paused in the air, his faltering covered by the dark of the night. <em>Dinner?</em></p>\n<p>The time came for Nightwing to meet the rest of the Justice League, and Clark found himself in the Watchtower early. Not that it was a strange sight in the slightest for him to be early to meetings, but this time, he was far more jittery than usual.</p>\n<p>The previous times they accepted new members into the League, Clark hadn\u2019t been nervous. He\u2019d been happy, ecstatic even!</p>\n<p>Cyborg integrated well despite being the youngest. Captain Marvel seemed to open up more and accept help more often as time passed. Hawkwoman could be a little rough around the edges at times, but she worked well with Wonder Woman. Hawkman had already formed a steady bond with many of the members and had long conversations with Martian Manhunter. Green Arrow had become fast friends with Green Lantern. Black Canary became their official therapist and a constant voice of reason and mediation when tempers flared.</p>\n<p>Everyone who had been added to the roster after the initial formation by the original seven Leaguers had become assets to the team.</p>\n<p>But hearing that tidbit of utterance from Nightwing about his relationship with Batman had Clark\u2019s nerves flare in a way they hadn\u2019t before.</p>\n<p>Seventeen years. Nightwing and Batman had known each other for seventeen years, and yet Batman still hadn\u2019t voted in favor of Nightwing joining the League. Why? And what had Nightwing meant about not attending dinner?</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe that last curiosity was more Clark\u2019s jealousy of the young hero apparently having such a longstanding relationship with the man he\u2019d had feelings toward for ages. Clark had met Batman only twelve years ago, and he vividly remembers the day six years ago when he realized that the friendly feelings he held for Batman were no longer just friendly. Clark couldn\u2019t look the man in the eye for two weeks without blushing like a cherry tomato.</p>\n<p>And perhaps six years was too many to harbor romantic feelings for someone without doing anything about it, but there Clark was. A wimp. A coward. A chicken. A wimp, coward, and chicken that was about to welcome a new recruit to the Justice League that had a longer standing relationship with Batman than he did.</p>\n<p><em>You wanted him to join</em>, Clark reminded himself.</p>\n<p>Aquaman was the next Leaguer to arrive, and he seemed in good spirits, greeting Clark with a smile even though he seemed on the tired side.</p>\n<p>They both made small talk on the far side of the room by the vast windows with a direct look at Earth, and Arthur asked about how the introduction with Nightwing went. Clark gave him the simple rundown but remained tightlipped about the supposed relationship with Batman. Clark wasn\u2019t supposed to have heard Nightwing muttering to himself, and he wasn\u2019t much of a gossip, unfortunately for Lois.</p>\n<p>As Clark and Arthur chatted, the next two to arrive were, to Clark\u2019s ever-growing dismay, Batman and Nightwing. They walked in together.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Batman said as he walked through the doors, but Clark noticed the distinct lack of gruffness in his tone that he usually held toward, well, just about everyone else. The select few who he didn\u2019t usually have a gruff, rough, annoyed tone for was Diana (of course), Barry (surprisingly), and then Clark (which he prided himself in). But now, Nightwing also seemed to hold that honor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on, B,\u201d Nightwing dragged out with a pout as he walked a half-step behind Batman. \u201cOne night. I\u2019ll return him in one piece.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two ignored the presence of Clark and Arthur as they went to Batman\u2019s seat at the head of the table. Granted, it was difficult to determine the \u201chead\u201d of the table when it was round, but considering it was the closest to the monitor display and emergency center, it was definitely where their unofficial leader sat, with Wonder Woman and Superman\u2019s seats on either side of him.</p>\n<p>Before Batman sat down in his seat, however, Nightwing raced forward and sat down, throwing his feet up on the table and sticking his tongue out playfully at Batman who stood quietly in front of him. And then Batman didn\u2019t snap at him. Didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t even seem angry or annoyed.</p>\n<p>Arthur raised a curious brow at the interaction and shared a glance with Clark. So, at least Clark wasn\u2019t the only one who found their relationship strange.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you weren\u2019t raised in a barn,\u201d Batman said simply as he set a stack of files down on the table, nothing harsh in his voice. In fact, his tone almost seemed. . . fond?</p>\n<p>\u201cOne night,\u201d Nightwing continued, ignoring Batman\u2019s quiet command to take his feet off the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe last time you had him for an entire night without me around, he came back singing Christmas carols and threatening to murder Santa Claus for watching him sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing shrugged with a chuckle. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was June.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Nightwing repeated. He then took his feet off the table and stuck his bottom lip out in an exaggerated pout. \u201cOh, come on, you love when we bond.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t give me a headache in return.\u201d They seemed to stare each other down until finally, Batman sighed, dipping his head. \u201cFine. One night. But please, no more Christmas carols.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gave in? Just like that? Batman actually caved?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Nightwing exclaimed, jumping up from the seat.</p>\n<p>He then did what Clark never thought he\u2019d ever see. Nightwing hugged Batman.</p>\n<p>Someone <em>hugged</em> Batman.</p>\n<p><em>Batman</em>.</p>\n<p>And he let it happen. He didn\u2019t attack or shove him away. Batman allowed Nightwing to hug him.</p>\n<p>Batman seemed unfazed at the arms wrapping around his shoulders in a tight embrace, and then he even accepted the hug by wrapping his own arms around Nightwing.</p>\n<p>The hug was quick, with Nightwing pulling out of it soon after, still bouncy and happy, but it still happened.</p>\n<p>Nightwing then sat on the table instead, next to the files, and Batman sat in his chair, shaking his head and muttering, \u201cWhat have I gotten myself into?\u201d Batman smacked Nightwing\u2019s hand as he tried grabbing the file that sat on top. \u201cYou\u2019re not official yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, please, like I couldn\u2019t just hack into the system and read it for myself,\u201d Nightwing said, grabbing the file anyway. And Batman proceeded to do nothing about it, even asking Nightwing questions about what he thought about the file in a way he never did with Clark.</p>\n<p>Clark would have felt more strange watching the exchange if he thought Batman and Nightwing didn\u2019t know he and Arthur were in the room. But Batman knew everything. Or at least it seemed like he did. Even so, the mysterious caped crusader did always have a good awareness of his surroundings, and Clark and Arthur weren\u2019t hiding, so Batman definitely could have ended the conversation earlier if he so desired.</p>\n<p>But still, Clark wished he hadn\u2019t seen that exchange.</p>\n<p>Arthur looked shocked as all hell at what had transpired, his eyebrows even shooting up in alarm when Nightwing hugged Batman. He seemed to want to ask about it, to bring it up to anyone in the room, whether it be Clark next to him or directly to Batman and Nightwing. But he kept his mouth shut after turning back to Clark.</p>\n<p>Clark\u2019s eyes settled on the way Batman patted Nightwing\u2019s knee or how he spoke softly to Nightwing or how he didn\u2019t move away from Nightwing\u2019s foot resting on the arm of his chair or allowed gentle taps on his arm or shoulder from Nightwing.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Nightwing, Nightwing, Nightwing.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And just when Clark was beginning to think that maybe, just maybe Batman might have shared his feelings. But now, he doubted he\u2019d ever reach the level of comfort and ease that Batman had with Nightwing. Clark had thought they were close before, but it turned out Batman and Superman just weren\u2019t as close as he thought.</p>\n<p>Oliver lowered the binoculars away from his eyes and glanced over to see Nightwing seemingly lost in thought.</p>\n<p>The young vigilante had been an official part of the Justice League for about a month when the villain Onomatopoeia popped back up again, this time in Star City. Why Oliver didn\u2019t argue when Batman recommended Nightwing for backup, he wasn\u2019t sure. It could be because he wanted to know more about the hero that Arthur swore up and down had hugged Batman and gotten away with it.</p>\n<p>Dinah was less intrigued by the rumor mill spreading throughout the other League members, but even she had to admit that someone hugging Batman was so far out of the left field that it warranted at least some looking into.</p>\n<p>So, there the three vigilantes sat on the roof of a tall building near the industrial district of the city staking out the area for signs of suspicious activity.</p>\n<p>Oliver couldn\u2019t find it in him to be annoyed that Nightwing was stuck in his head considering he had been young once, getting distracted by errant thoughts occasionally. And the kid clearly had plenty of experience bouncing out of the mindset when the need arose, so that wasn\u2019t the problem.</p>\n<p>The problem was that Oliver was curious. And it ate at him.</p>\n<p>The Justice League had formed eleven years ago, and not a single member of the team could consider themselves close enough to Batman that they knew his identity. Not even Superman who not so secretly was in love with the guy. But here strolled in Nightwing who had a good relationship with the man, enough that he could apparently ask for one night with someone close to Batman?</p>\n<p>Arthur hadn\u2019t been certain what Nightwing was exactly asking for, so hearing it second-hand, Oliver definitely didn\u2019t know either. Did Oliver really believe Arthur had seen them hug? Arthur had also said Nightwing called him \u2018B\u2019 when Batman typically shot down any attempt at nicknames for him, aside from Hal\u2019s \u2018Spooky\u2019 considering he never listened to Batman\u2019s complaints about it.</p>\n<p>Even then, Batman had voted against Nightwing joining the team, so why was he allowing playful antics and hugs and nicknames and recommending him for missions?</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t fair, and Oliver wanted to hate the kid, yet he couldn\u2019t. Nightwing was fun and entertaining and cracked jokes easily with him, Hal, and Barry. Batman loosened up a bit when around Nightwing\u2014not much but even the tiny sliver of change was noticeable enough. Batsy also seemed to trust Nightwing unconditionally, in a way that had never been afforded to any other member, except occasionally Superman and Wonder Woman, but that went without saying since those three were like three peas in a pod.</p>\n<p>Well, until Nightwing showed up and everyone realized that whatever Batman\u2019s relationship was with Superman and Wonder Woman, it didn\u2019t even remotely compare to his relationship with Nightwing, whatever <em>that</em> was.</p>\n<p>And to top off Oliver\u2019s list of frustrations, fuck, did Nightwing seem familiar. He couldn\u2019t place it for the life of him, but his mannerisms were so eerily familiar that Oliver couldn\u2019t scratch the itch in his mind that he should know the kid.</p>\n<p>Nightwing perched on the balls of his feet on the half-wall lining edge of the roof, undeterred by the presence of the long drop or the incredible balance on the thin surface. Even though he was staring in the direction of the warehouses, the tilt of his head and slow tapping of his fingers on his calves indicated to Oliver that he had other things on his mind than the Onomatopoeia mission.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Oliver asked, looking up at Nightwing.</p>\n<p>\u201cRings,\u201d Nightwing answered. Another thing that set him apart from Batman was his general honesty when speaking. Sure, he strayed away from anything too specific, but he also didn\u2019t completely shut down any and all inquiries.</p>\n<p>\u201cRings?\u201d Oliver repeated curiously.</p>\n<p>Nightwing shrugged, glancing over. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve just been thinking about proposing lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dinah hummed quietly on Oliver\u2019s other side, leaning on the half-wall. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet,\u201d she said, still watching the buildings for movement. \u201cAnd you\u2019re wondering what kind of ring to get them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d There was a wistful quality to his voice as he spoke. \u201cI went ring shopping once before for someone else, and that didn\u2019t turn out to be what I had hoped. I don\u2019t want to mess it up this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are mistakes if not lessons to learn?\u201d Dinah pitched wisely. Ever the psychiatrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I should just talk to B,\u201d Nightwing muttered to himself, but Oliver still picked it up in the quiet night. \u201cAsk what he thinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oliver\u2019s fingers gripped the binoculars tight as he tried not to show that he heard Nightwing\u2019s mumbling. Dinah also stiffened, though less noticeably, and Oliver knew she had the same line of thought.</p>\n<p>Was Arthur right? Were Batman and Nightwing really closer than they let on? Maybe even close enough to warrant Nightwing thinking about proposing?</p>\n<p>No, absolutely not. That couldn\u2019t possibly be the case. <em>Right?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are married, yeah?\u201d Nightwing asked, perking up a little and drawing Oliver from his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, willing himself to keep a straight face. No emotion, no shock, remain passive.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like being on a team together while in a relationship?\u201d Nightwing wondered. \"While married?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can be difficult,\u201d Oliver said carefully. \u201cBalancing priorities is usually the hardest.\u201d Was he seriously giving Nightwing relationship advice about their sort of boss?</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you handle it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen communication is necessary,\u201d Dinah said. \u201cThere can\u2019t be any secrets, and when something comes up, you need to be honest about it. Be ready to talk out any conflict and see things from their point of view. And never go to bed angry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing chuckled lightly. \u201cI think that\u2019s advice for any relationship, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dinah tilted her head as she shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s still necessary, even more so for team members. There\u2019s a reason so many workplaces recommend against getting involved with coworkers. Things get messy. Especially if one is of higher status or rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oliver loved her for adding that last point in there. An easy way to gauge if Nightwing was really talking about him and Batman or not.</p>\n<p>Nightwing\u2019s gaze turned downcast as he thought over her words. \u201cLike a leader avoiding favoritism when assigning missions. Or needing to choose between their person and the goal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Shit, shit, shit.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Nightwing and Batman were dating. They were dating. Spooky had a young boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Like, sure, he had taste, great. Nightwing seemed like a good-looking dude from what Oliver could tell with the mask covering half his face, even when clearly on the young side, but shit. Batman was in a relationship. He was in a relationship with someone who was contemplating marriage and seemed comfortable enough to be the one doing the asking.</p>\n<p>Someone wanted to propose to Batman. Nightwing wanted to propose to Batman!</p>\n<p>Oh, poor Clark.</p>\n<p>\u201cPart of me wants to believe him, you know? It\u2019s hilarious and also kinda cute to think about, but I just can\u2019t. Spooky an-and Nightwing? I Am the Night and Sunnyside Up? Those two?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hal shook his head while walking down a hall of the Watchtower with Barry by his side. After being told by Oliver all about what he and Dinah heard during their mission, Hal just wasn\u2019t quite sure what to believe when it came to the idea of Batman with motherfucking Nightwing of all people.</p>\n<p>Nightwing was cool, and Batman, well, Batman was not. At least in Hal\u2019s book. At least Nightwing had a sense of humor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Barry said, jittery in his movements as he walked facing Hal, \u201cbut ever since Arthur said he and Supes saw them hugging, Clark\u2019s been more down than usual. He hides it well enough, but add in his behavior with what Arthur said they saw and now what Ollie\u2019s claiming, and it\u2019s gotta be true, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Barry had a point. Everything that Arthur and Oliver had said plus Clark\u2019s behavior (as subtle as it was) didn\u2019t leave a whole lot to imagine. What other options were there aside from Batman and Nightwing being in a relationship? Hal certainly couldn\u2019t think of any. And maybe, just maybe, Clark had gotten confirmation from Batman himself considering that the two were friends. Not that Clark would ever tell anyone what people tell him in confidence, but still.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but Batman?\u201d Hal stressed. \u201cAnd Nightwing? Their attitudes couldn\u2019t be more different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what makes them work,\u201d Barry said with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just think we need a little more evidence than that, or, I don\u2019t know, to see it for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>They rounded the corner to the Monitor Room, intending to begin their monitor duty, but they stopped in their tracks upon seeing Batman and Nightwing inside.</p>\n<p>Well, ain\u2019t that ironic timing?</p>\n<p>Hal grabbed Barry by the arm and hid them behind the wall to remain unseen. Hal and Barry peeked their heads out to watch carefully as Nightwing beamed from ear to ear and threw his arms around Batman, and Batman returned the hug, snaking his own arms around Nightwing\u2019s torso.</p>\n<p>Was Hal going crazy or was Batman also smiling? Shit, he was. Batman was smiling! Why the hell was he smiling? Was it the end of the world? The most Hal had ever seen from him was a smirk tossed at Supes, and he\u2019d nearly had a heart attack.</p>\n<p>When Nightwing stepped out of the hug, Batman reached up and set his hand, heavy gauntlet and all, on Nightwing\u2019s cheek, saying something quietly before then reaching down to grab Nightwing\u2019s ungloved hand and slide something onto his finger.</p>\n<p>Something that glinted delicately in the light.</p>\n<p>A silver band.</p>\n<p>Fuck, Batman just put a ring on Nightwing\u2019s finger. What has the world come to?</p>\n<p>If Clark thought his crush on Batman had passed the point of no return before, it hit a whole other milestone upon meeting Robin. Like the gossip from Barry, Hal, Oliver, and Arthur wasn\u2019t already making it worse.</p>\n<p>The meeting started with Nightwing catching Robin in mid-air before Clark could and then teasingly saying, \u201cB would kill me if I returned you with anything broken.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin then stuck out his tongue in playful defiance the same way Clark had seen Nightwing do to Batman only two months before.</p>\n<p>Clark and Diana had gone to New York to deal with Giganta before any serious property damage could be inflicted. Together, the two had it covered nicely. That was why Superman offered to go with her, to get it done quickly. It only added to their surprise to see Nightwing there with a child dressed in red, yellow, green, and black, both falling through the air.</p>\n<p>But Nightwing was quick with his grapple and caught the kid easily without needing help from Clark and Diana.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until they were finished with the Giganta business that they were introduced to the kid, who looked no older than fourteen but no younger than eleven.</p>\n<p>On the rooftop the four settled on, Nightwing gestured to the kid who stood proud beside him and said, \u201cThis is Robin.\u201d Nightwing set his hand on Robin\u2019s shoulder with a gentle pat and let it rest there.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Robin,\u201d Diana said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Robin curtly nodded. \u201cLikewise, Wonder Woman.\u201d His head then tilted up to look at Superman. \u201cAlien.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Nightwing scolded, flicking the kid on the back of the head.</p>\n<p>The kid crossed his arms over his chest with a huff, looking away with a mumbled, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, so this Robin not liking him stung a bit, but Clark had heard and dealt with worse than a surly child vigilante. At least, until he realized something that hurt far worse.</p>\n<p>Robin was Batman\u2019s son.</p>\n<p>If a child was ever so clearly Batman\u2019s child, it was Robin. Robin who had Batman\u2019s strong jaw and broad shoulders. Robin who had a sword strapped to his back. Robin who quietly sneered at the presence of Superman. Robin who had Batman\u2019s same scowl. Robin who stood with such poise and arrogance that it reminded Clark of the early days he knew Batman.</p>\n<p>Clark tried not to let anything show.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you two doing in New York?\u201d Clark asked amicably.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were visiting Titan\u2019s Tower,\u201d Nightwing answered. \u201cIt was supposed to be just a quick trip, but Robin wanted to join. Make it a weekend thing. It helps that he likes challenging Beast Boy to fights.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone needs to,\u201d Robin said snidely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you could stop trying to beat up my teammates, that\u2019d be great,\u201d Nightwing told him. \u201cEven if you do often kick their asses.\u201d Nightwing looked back up at Clark and Diana. \u201cHe\u2019s like a little demon when he fights.\u201d</p>\n<p>That got a smile out of Robin, and that broad grin was directed at Nightwing.</p>\n<p>Clark could at that to the list of things that made his heart ache. Robin looked at Nightwing like he was his whole world.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps we could spar sometime, Robin,\u201d Diana offered, smiling fondly at the two.</p>\n<p>The way Robin focused on Diana made Clark wonder if Robin was sizing her up and calculating his chances against her. But he didn\u2019t respond, keeping whatever he decided to himself.</p>\n<p>Nightwing chuckled and tugged Robin closer. \u201cWe should get going. Long drive back to Gotham.\u201d He gave them a salute as they began walking to the edge of the roof. \u201cGood seeing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Together, the two leaped off the roof, using their grapples to land safely down below, and as Clark turned to head out with Diana, he heard Nightwing and Robin talking. He didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop but part of him couldn\u2019t help it the moment he heard the word \u2018dad.\u2019</p>\n<p>Well, a version of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaba,\u201d Robin said quietly to Nightwing in the privacy of the alley below. \u201cDo I need to go back tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Nightwing said softly. Clark heard the rustling of fabric, and he imagined Nightwing had hugged the kid. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wanna go back to B?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFather\u2019s been busy with a case and won\u2019t let me help,\u201d Robin revealed. \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to have the Robin suit right now. When news hits about Giganta, I\u2019ll be grounded for even longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Baby Bat, you can\u2019t just run from your problems.\u201d Nightwing paused. \u201cOr use me to get out of your grounding without telling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFather hasn\u2019t called all weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not in big trouble when we get back.\u201d Nightwing was quiet for a few moments again. \u201cBut no more Christmas carols around him, \u2018kay? We don\u2019t need him angrier than usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin laughed quietly. \u201cNo promises, Baba.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound of their chorused laughter was then drowned out by the sound of a motorcycle engine.</p>\n<p>Diana snapped him out of his eavesdropping. \u201cI wish I could say I was disappointed, but I heard it, too,\u201d she said, looking at Clark knowingly. Clark bashfully scratched at the back of his head. At least he wasn\u2019t the only one eavesdropping. \u201cBaba and Father. I\u2019m happy for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clark didn\u2019t miss her tone. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Diana,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for them, too. There\u2019s just. . .\u201d He trailed off with a wistful sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cPart of you wonders what it could have been like if you told him sooner,\u201d Diana finished for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Clark gazed up at the sky where the stars were becoming visible in the early night, peeking out from behind the sparse clouds. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he meant it. He meant every word.</p>\n<p>Another month passed with the entire Justice League coming to terms with the fact that Batman and Nightwing were in a relationship and getting married. Most of the team were surprised or reluctant to believe it, but the more they saw of the two\u2019s interactions, the more they believed it, and the more they were happy for them.</p>\n<p>Except for Cyborg, that is, but no one knew why he continued to be a disbeliever, especially since he never said his reasons. So, to the rest of the team, he was just a cynic, and they ignored him.</p>\n<p>Then one day, Oliver and Hal arrested Red Hood while he was in Star City and brought him up to the Watchtower.</p>\n<p>Typically, Gotham rogues were left to Batman, but they hadn\u2019t even gotten the chance to call him when Nightwing and Robin arrived and asked what he was doing in Star City. They asked Red Hood why he was in that city instead of asking Oliver or Hal what Red Hood had been doing when they arrested him. Though they were also wondering why Nightwing was even asking considering Red Hood was on their Most Wanted list.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just visiting a friend, but Lame Arrow here decided I must\u2019ve been doing something illegal,\u201d Red Hood snarked, then turned sharply to Oliver. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a wanted criminal,\u201d Oliver pointed out, annoyed at the degrading nickname.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe certainly isn\u2019t <em>wanted</em>, even if he is a criminal,\u201d Robin said, arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>Nightwing had to bite back a chuckle and lightly smacked Robin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStop it. That's rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is this child?\u201d Hal asked, pointing at Robin.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin, of course,\u201d Robin answered snottily for himself.</p>\n<p>Hal looked at Nightwing for a direct answer instead, but Nightwing nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d Hal said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s he doing in the Watchtower?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s with me,\u201d Nightwing said as if that answered the question. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Hood from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d Oliver asked. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing looked at him as though he was thinking Oliver was an idiot. \u201cHe\u2019s Gotham\u2019s problem. Frankly, I don\u2019t even know why Batman hasn\u2019t taken him off the list. He\u2019s been a good boy lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, bite me, Dickwing,\u201d Red Hood growled beneath the helmet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would, but I\u2019m into redheads,\u201d Nightwing playfully snarked back.</p>\n<p>The Zeta tube then announced the arrival of Flash who was about to zoom past and go directly to the Monitor room, but he stopped by the group gathered in the foyer instead, curious as to why Hal was escorting a criminal but had stalled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Barry asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently, Nightwing is into redheads,\u201d Hal joked, yet the joke also had the side effect of Hal, Oliver, and Barry all from this point believing that Batman must\u2019ve had red hair.</p>\n<p>Then Oliver realized something. \u201cWait, does that mean you know he\u2019s not a redhead?\u201d he asked, gesturing to Red Hood with a nod of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been subjected to his ridiculous skunk stripe for years in the Batcave,\u201d Robin said. \u201cHe should really start dyeing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, Demon Brat,\u201d Red Hood growled. \u201cCan we throw him in the Gotham Reservoir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think B would allow that,\u201d Nightwing said.</p>\n<p>Robin stared defiantly up at Red Hood. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cutting in again, Oliver asked, \u201cWait, wait, so you know each other?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, are you slow,\u201d Red Hood groaned. \u201cYeah, you think I wear the Bat symbol on my chest for no reason? It\u2019s not to piss Batman off. I\u2019m one of Gotham\u2019s vigilantes, jackass. The crime thing\u2019s in the past. Bring it up with Batman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oliver, Hal, and Barry looked at him in alarm, but they didn\u2019t get the chance to ask when Superman and Martian Manhunter left the Monitor room and noticed them on their way to the Zeta access.</p>\n<p>\u201cFlash, you were supposed to be relieving us with Cyborg,\u201d J\u2019onn said as he and Clark walked over. He then noticed their shocked expressions. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to explain that Red Hood should be handled by Batman, and we\u2019ll take him to Gotham,\u201d Nightwing answered, gesturing to himself and Robin.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Oliver said quickly, shaking his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t just gloss over what Hood said. Is he seriously one of Gotham\u2019s vigilantes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Gotham only had Batman,\u201d J\u2019onn said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Robin,\u201d Clark added, looking over the group curiously.</p>\n<p>Red Hood let out a loud, sharp laugh. \u201cYeah, right. What\u2019s the number at now? Ten? No, eleven including \u2018Wing when he\u2019s by on weekends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou forgot Batwing,\u201d Nightwing pointed out. \u201cSo twelve total.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I forgot Batwing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s usually the one you forget.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was when Clark quietly pulled out his communicator and sent a message to Diana requesting her presence in the Watchtower. If anyone was going to get to the bottom of things quickly and efficiently without the presence of Batman, it\u2019d be her. And part of him wanted her reassuring presence as he continued to learn more and more that he apparently didn\u2019t know anything about Batman.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to the whole \u2018I work alone\u2019 thing?\u201d Hal asked.</p>\n<p>That got good belly laughs out of Nightwing and Red Hood, and even a quiet chuckle from Robin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t worked alone in a good seventeen years,\u201d Nightwing said through the laughter. \u201cOr ever if you count Penny-One, which I do, but he\u2019s not a vigilante.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t told any of you because he doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d Red Hood said.</p>\n<p>Nightwing made a strangled noise as he shook his head and waved his hand. \u201cThat is not true. He\u2019s just not friendly and only sees them as colleagues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re standing right here,\u201d Clark pointed out, raising his hand to get their attention. The others didn\u2019t miss the ounce of hurt in his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we see that, Boy Scout,\u201d Red Hood said, looking back at him before focusing on Hal. \u201cSo, can you let me go, glowstick? Batsy\u2019s favorite has already vouched for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hal glanced at Oliver who sighed with a shrug, then he undid the cuffs binding Red Hood\u2019s wrists. Hood rolled his wrists before rubbing them. Hal and Oliver remained tense as Red Hood grabbed his duffle from them roughly, but when he only threw it over his shoulder, they relaxed a bit. He also went to stand next to them, watching as Red Hood patted Nightwing on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>The nearby Zeta access then came to life as both Cyborg and Wonder Woman entered the Watchtower.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have we missed?\u201d Diana greeted carefully, eyes flitting around the gathered, ever-growing group.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust handing off a criminal to Nightwing and a child,\u201d Hal said, shrugging. \u201cMust be nice to be Spooky\u2019s boy toy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing, Red Hood, and Robin tensed and looked at Hal. \u201cUm, excuse me?\u201d Nightwing asked. \u201cWhat exactly do you mean by that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, was it supposed to be a secret?\u201d Hal wondered. \u201cThe whole League knows you and Spooky are together. It\u2019s alright. We\u2019re all cool about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing, Red Hood, and Robin each let out groans of utter disgust at varying levels of volume, each verging on gagging and wanting to vomit at the mere suggestion as they folded in on themselves.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoldie and the old man?\u201d Red Hood said. \u201cOh, that shit\u2019s disgusting.\u201d He raised a hand to his helmet, setting it on where his forehead would be as if lightheaded.</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s hand went to the handle of his sword as he started to unsheathe it. \u201cHow dare you insinuate such a repulsive idea!\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing barely reacted as he grabbed Robin by his wrist, holding him back. He focused on Hal. \u201cExcuse me? You think we\u2019re what?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cTogether,\u201d Hal answered. \u201cDating. Partners. Getting busy. <em>Lovers</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they get it, Lantern,\u201d Clark interrupted desperately at the same time Nightwing said, \u201cPlease stop,\u201d in a small voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNasty,\u201d Red Hood said. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve heard all day. Hell, worst thing I\u2019ve heard all year!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing that Batman\u2019s in love with is justice,\u201d Nightwing assured, letting Robin\u2019s wrist go.</p>\n<p>Robin then said, \u201cWell, that and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to get into that,\u201d Nightwing cut off, nudging Robin with his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna hurl,\u201d Red Hood continued bemoaning.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt pains me, but I am with Hood,\u201d Robin said. \u201cThe thought of Nightwing and Batman is nauseating.\u201d He shivered.</p>\n<p>Nightwing wiped a hand over his face, growing more and more unamused by the second. \u201cWe get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Hood fake gagged and Nightwing shoved him away, causing him to start laughing. \u201cOh, they\u2019re never going to believe us!\u201d Red Hood said, doubling over as his laughter filled the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Oliver asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone.\u201d Red Hood held his arms out. \u201cEveryone! How idiotic do you have to be\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHood.\u201d Nightwing sent a glare his way.</p>\n<p>Red Hood waved him off. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you\u2019re not immediately about to call up all your friends the moment you get home and expound on the fact that the Justice League is composed of a group of morons that think you are dating <em>Batman</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d Victor started, \u201cI\u2019ve never once believed it and always said it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat goes without saying, Cy,\u201d Nightwing said. \u201cYou\u2019re better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hal gaped in offense, turning to his fellow team members. \u201cAre we just going to sit here and listen to this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin glared his way, shifting his weight dangerously. \u201cYou deserve worse than public humiliation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m not waiting.\u201d Red Hood pulled out his phone from his jacket pocket. \u201cI\u2019m telling everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Clark asked. Oh, how he didn\u2019t want Batman to know about this.</p>\n<p>Red Hood cackled to himself. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHood, no,\u201d Nightwing pleaded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m continuing to agree with Hood,\u201d Robin said.</p>\n<p>Nightwing quickly faced Robin. \u201cBaby Bat, no. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin crossed his arms over his chest again. \u201cYou will not allow me to stab them. Batman and Penny-One would be disappointed as well. Humiliation it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few moments later, the younger Flash came speeding in, in tandem with the Zeta tube announcing his arrival. Wally\u2019s bright red hair stood ruffled and curled on top of his unprotected head. He stopped next to Nightwing, between him and Red Hood, gaping at the League.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is <em>disgusting</em>,\u201d was the first thing out of Wally\u2019s mouth. No greeting. No pleasantries. Just him being completely appalled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Oliver started, but he was interrupted.</p>\n<p>Wally held up his phone, the text from Hood on display.</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong>JT Hood</strong>: Your dumbass uncle and co think N is dating B. </em>\n<em>Watchtower.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\" Wally asked incredulously. \"You all think <em>Nightwing</em> is dating <em>Batman</em>? Even you, Uncle Barry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing groaned. \u201cWho all did you text?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d Red Hood answered. \"Funnily enough, he was the last one.\"</p>\n<p>Barry nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders, trying to make it seem less like a problem. \u201cIs it really such a big deal?\u201d he asked. What he really wanted to ask was why it couldn\u2019t blow over already.</p>\n<p>Nightwing, Wally, Hood, and Robin all chorused, \u201cYes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, you\u2019re not dating Batman,\u201d J\u2019onn said, placatingly raising his hands, \u201cbut why are you treating this misunderstanding as something unforgivable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think the real question is why you even think it in the first place?\u201d Red Hood asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone hug Batman and live,\u201d Barry said.</p>\n<p>Oliver went next, motioning to Nightwing. \u201cYou said you were thinking about proposing but weren\u2019t sure about the ring. Then you decided to just ask Batman. And you asked about being on a team with someone you\u2019re married to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, Flash and I saw Spooky put a ring on your finger while smiling,\u201d Hal added. \u201cWe thought that was him proposing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cYeah, I guess that does all sound incriminating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that was not Batman proposing to you, what was it?\u201d Diana asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to show him the ring my fianc\u00e9 picked out for me,\u201d Nightwing explained. \u201cAnd after looking it over, he put it back on me. I didn\u2019t think it was weird.\u201d His tone showed an insecurity that hadn\u2019t been there before.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Red Hood reassured harshly. \u201cThey\u2019re just reading into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a father can\u2019t be happy for his son.\u201d Robin clicked his tongue before freezing upon realizing what he had revealed. Both Nightwing and Red Hood glared at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Clark asked, eyes widening.</p>\n<p>\u201cCare to repeat that?\u201d Hal prodded.</p>\n<p>Robin shifted his weight. \u201cNo, I do not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were Nightwing\u2019s son,\u201d Diana then brought up.</p>\n<p>Everyone turned to look at her, aside from Clark who ducked his head with a blush, indicating he had thought the same thing. Considering neither Diana nor Clark were much for gossiping about their team members, none of them had been privy to those thoughts prior, and it surprised them all, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Barry was the first to speak after that bombshell. \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rest of us are not on Diana\u2019s wavelength,\u201d Oliver told the younger heroes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe heard Robin call Nightwing \u2018Baba\u2019 which means \u2018Dad\u2019 in Arabic,\u201d Clark explained. \u201cAnd then he also referred to Batman as \u2018Father.\u2019 That\u2019s why we assumed Nightwing and Batman were together.\u201d</p>\n<p>J\u2019onn gazed at each of them carefully, studying their mannerisms and words. \u201cJust when I was beginning to understand humans.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barry threw his hands up in exasperation. \u201cI dunno, man. I\u2019m human, and I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nightwing sighed and wiped his hand over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story that includes secret identities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to keep it short, I\u2019ve helped raise Robin, so our relationship has become more like father and son rather than siblings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hal pointed at him. \u201cSo, you are Spooky\u2019s son then? And so\u2019s Robin?\u201d he asked for clarity.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust forget the other one in the room, huh? That\u2019s cool,\u201d Red Hood said offhandedly. \u201cMiddle children just suck, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Spooky\u2019s son, too?\u201d Hal asked in surprise. \u201cHow many damn kids does he have?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo many,\u201d Red Hood said as Nightwing answered, \u201cA lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>They then all froze at the announcement of Batman and Red Robin\u2019s arrival via the Zeta tube. The group went dead silent as they all looked to see Batman stalking over to them with another vigilante at his heels. This vigilante dressed in a fashion similar to Batman and Robin, with a cape and cowl along with red and yellow. He also had a bird logo on his chest, like the Nightwing did. The other members of the League didn\u2019t recognize him, but Nightwing, Red Hood, and Robin did.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Batman asked, coming up on them. He looked around and received no response. So, he put his hands on his hips and tried again, his voice stern and gruff as he expected someone to answer him. \u201cRed Robin refused to elaborate more than coming up to the Watchtower urgently. I will ask again. What is going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Barry looked at him with wide eyes and a gaping expression, horrified. \u201cIt makes so much sense now. The Dad voice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Spooky <em>is</em> a dad,\u201d Hal muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Batman asked the same way Nightwing had earlier.</p>\n<p>Red Hood chuckled, though it lacked mirth. \u201cCat\u2019s outta the bag about the Batfamily,\u201d he said. \u201cBlame the Demon Brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin raised his chin, meeting Batman\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt was a slip of the tongue. I apologize, Father. Though I said nothing other than Nightwing being your son. Those two idiots brought up me and Hood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike they didn\u2019t already know you were his kid, you little gremlin,\u201d Red Hood countered.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did this even come up?\u201d Batman asked, a tired tone setting in.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was probably an explanation to stop them from thinking you and \u2018Wing are together,\u201d Red Robin said.</p>\n<p>Batman\u2019s shoulders tensed as he turned slowly to face Red Robin. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Red Robin handed Batman his phone, showing the text Hood had sent him not ten minutes prior, and the present members of the Justice League waited with bated breath. They didn\u2019t know what precisely was in the text, and they feared Batman\u2019s reaction to the assumption.</p>\n<p><strong><em>~dead hood~</em></strong>: <em>The League thinks Dickwing and Daddy Bats are fucking. Get to the Watchtower ASAP.</em></p>\n<p>Batman slowly handed Red Robin his phone back and turned to the Justice League. Tense moments passed as he looked at each and every one of their faces. He silently wondered if the others that were not present also thought the same thing. He assumed they did. The only one who seemed unfazed by the entire situation was Cyborg, but he had known Nightwing for years and thus clearly remembered that Nightwing had once been Robin, which meant he definitely knew Nightwing wasn\u2019t romantically or sexually involved with Batman.</p>\n<p>This meant Victor was the only one who didn\u2019t deserve Batman\u2019s contempt. The others did though.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on a team with a bunch of morons,\u201d Batman finally said.</p>\n<p>Cries of outrage erupted amongst the group, particularly from Hal and Oliver, yet every member present was offended in some way, except Cyborg and Nightwing. Then Batman slowly stalked forward, and they quieted down as Batman pointed to Wally while looking at Barry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the most disappointed in you, Flash,\u201d Batman said.</p>\n<p>It took a few moments for Barry to realize what Batman was referring to as he glanced back and forth between him and Wally, and then he finally settled on Nightwing and noticed how close Wally was standing next to him. Brain synapses fired at lightning speed as he slowly came to the realization that Nightwing was Wally\u2019s boyfriend, or now fianc\u00e9, whom he had met multiple times and had dinner with when they announced their engagement.</p>\n<p>Oh, geez, he'd called them <em>best friends</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Barry blurted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d Red Robin quipped.</p>\n<p>Wally easily nodded in silent agreement with Red Robin before smiling as Nightwing laced their fingers. It was a sight that Barry had seen many times before. Wally and his boyfriend could be sickeningly sweet when they set their minds to it and even when they weren\u2019t trying.</p>\n<p>Then another set of realizations set in for Barry. He\u2019d met Wally\u2019s boyfriend. His civilian boyfriend. He hadn\u2019t known until now that that boyfriend was Nightwing, so he\u2019d only known him as\u2014</p>\n<p>Wally was dating Dick Grayson.</p>\n<p>Dick Grayson as in Richard Grayson-Wayne, the eldest son of the billionaire Bruce Wayne, the CEO of Wayne Enterprises and Prince of Gotham. Richard Grayson-Wayne who had multiple other siblings: namely, Jason Todd-Wayne, Timothy Drake-Wayne, Damian Wayne, and Cassandra Cain-Wayne. Richard Grayson-Wayne who worked as a cop out of Bl\u00fcdhaven, New Jersey. Richard Grayson-Wayne who had grown up in a circus and had lost his parents in a tragic incident seventeen years ago.</p>\n<p>Dick Grayson was Nightwing.</p>\n<p>It all made so much sense. Everything had been staring him in the face, and it was only just now clicking.</p>\n<p>Barry\u2019s jaw settled in a semi-permanent open position as he processed everything. \u201cWait, that means you\u2019re\u2014\u201d He pointed at Nightwing. \u201cAnd you\u2019re\u2014\u201d His pointing shifted to Batman. \u201cAnd the others\u2014\u201d He shook his head with a strangled yelp, brain short-circuiting, and he quickly hid his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe just realized your identities, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Diana asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he\u2019s the only one,\u201d Red Hood said, looking in Oliver\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>Not a moment later did Oliver begin donning the same shocked expression as Barry, though his had more anger in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. . . Wally is dating\u2014\u201d Oliver cut himself off as his eyes snapped wide open, and he looked up at Batman. \u201cShit, come on! Really? We\u2019ve been friends for over twenty years! And this is how I find out that you\u2019re Batman? What the hell!\u201d</p>\n<p>Batman didn\u2019t react. \u201cNot my fault you\u2019re too slow, Ollie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe went to school together!\u201d Oliver exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"We've slept together!\"</p>\n<p>\"Your point?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still very confused,\u201d Hal said, a bit sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d J\u2019onn agreed. Clark didn\u2019t say it aloud, but he did nod in agreement as well.</p>\n<p>Batman sighed and shared a few glances with his sons, then they all reached up and remove their masks and cowls, showing the group their faces, something they should have done ages ago.</p>\n<p>It was then Clark\u2019s turn for his brain to short circuit. \u201cBruce. . . Wayne?\u201d</p>\n<p>The handsome face of Bruce Wayne gazed carefully up at Clark with the makings of a small smile. \u201cClark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything hit Clark at once.</p>\n<p>Every meeting with Bruce Wayne at a gala or one of the Wayne Enterprise buildings or the Daily Planet. Every knowing grin Bruce donned when Clark brought something up during their meetings or interviews. Every time Batman would mention something that was in Clark\u2019s articles when on monitor duty with Superman. Every piece of seemingly innocuous information that either Batman or Bruce \u2018let slip\u2019 to Clark and Superman.</p>\n<p>Every flirtatious comment Clark and Superman received from Bruce. Every time Bruce asked out Clark and Superman. They weren\u2019t jokes or Brucie Wayne being a stereotypical playboy. They were real. Every single time. And Clark had turned down every single one.</p>\n<p>Clark just had one thing left to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce chuckled of all things, taking the insult in stride. \u201cI deserved that.\u201d</p>"
