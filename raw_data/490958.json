  "summary": "<p>Stiles figured that Mrs. McCall finding out Scott\u2019s secret would change things, but he\u2019s completely unprepared for the very first thing she does, which is to invite Isaac to move in with her and Scott.</p>\n<p>\u00a0***</p>\n<p>In which Stiles is angry. For some very good reasons.</p>\n<p>Six days cooped up in his own room is well past Stiles' lack of human contact limit.</p>\n<p>Little bit of a shorter chapter, I think, but not by much. I still have a pretty decent backlog already written, and I'm hoping to get more done this weekend, so I should be able to maintain the \"chapter every few days\" thing for a bit longer!</p>",
  "notes": "<p>This story picks up from the end of the season 2 finale. It's mostly canon compliant, although I've tweaked some details to suit the story. For example, in that last scene of the finale between Stiles and Scott, Stiles' cheek is fully healed. I'm... condensing the timeline a bit, and it's fair to say that something like that scene may have happened, but sooner (in this fic) than the canon implies. Make sense?</p>\n<p>Also, the rating is possibly end game, we'll see how that goes, and the relationships are tentative. Haha, I AM REALLY SELLING THIS, I BET. I've been having fun writing it though, and I got antsy about posting it, so here we are. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Longer chapter for you guys! Just a heads up, the next one might not be up until the end of this week.</p>\n<p>Oh gosh, another long one, and I didn't even include everything I'd initially intended to be in this chapter. Whooops. You may also notice that I've changed the number of chapters from 7 to a question mark. It's possible that a plot may have crept in and taken up residence without my consent, so I do apologize for that. As soon as I have a better idea of how this is going to progress, I'll put up another estimate.</p>\n<p>Anyway, yes, plot ahoy! Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>I keep expecting to sit down and write a quick, short chapter, and then I end up with almost five thousand words. Sorry for keeping you guys waiting! (And on a cliffhanger, no less!) Hopefully this chapter doesn't disappoint. :) No guarantees on when the next chapter will be - I'm gearing up for a couple busy weeks, but hopefully I'll have time to squeeze in an update somewhere along the line! Thanks again for reading, and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Also, this chapter does contain some descriptions of a panic attack. It's not particularly graphic, but I just thought I would give a head's up!)</p>\n<p>Another long-ish one for you guys! Sorry for the slight wait - real life has been terribly busy, so I haven't had much of a chance to write. The busy-ness isn't guaranteed to let up any time soon, so don't worry if this goes another week or so without being updated. I promise, I am still plugging away! :)</p>\n<p>I am so very sorry for the wait, everyone! I honestly didn't expect it to be this long, but life has been busy, and then I got sidetracked with another plot bunny, and I'm afraid this fic got shifted to the back burner for awhile. I have neither forgotten about this fic, nor abandoned it, however, and I am actually really excited for what's coming up, so never fear! Updates might not be as quick as they were at the start, but I'm determined that this fic shall not languish in WIP-dom for too much longer. As ever, thanks so much for reading, and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>A thousand and one apologies for the ridiculously long wait. This chapter gave me FITS, but now it is done and it is posted and thank goodness for that. I'd intended to lump another scene or two in with this one, but I figured it had been a long enough wait between chapters, and that I'd rather just go ahead and get this one posted. I'm thinking there'll be one more chapter, maaaaybe two before I get this all wrapped up.</p>\n<p>Also PLEASE NOTE: I've added a couple tags for this chapter in order to warn for it being a violent one. Nothing too far away from canon, I don't think, but please be aware!</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your patience, and I hope this doesn't disappoint!</p>\n<p>It's finally finished, yay! A HUGE thank you to everyone who stuck with me on this story. I never expected it to take nearly this long to completely, nor did I expect it to take some of the turns it did. Of course, now that I've had days and weeks and months to overload my brain with all sorts of brilliant meta, there are some things I would probably do differently, but overall, I'm really happy with the way this turned out. </p>\n<p>I will probably go on a comment spree sometime this week, so don't be surprised if you suddenly get a reply on a comment you left awhile ago. (I am SO grateful for the lovely, LOVELY comments you've all left, and I do apologize for dropping the ball so terribly on responses. I'll be getting to them in the near future, for sure!)</p>\n<p>I hope the final chapter doesn't disappoint! Thanks again for being awesome and SO patient! &lt;3</p>\n<p>I do have a tumblr, if anyone feels like hanging out. You can find me <a href=\"https://sidekickinit.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">here!</a></p>",
  "text": "<p></p>\n<p>~*~*~*~</p>\n<p>Stiles figured that Mrs. McCall finding out Scott\u2019s secret would change things, but he\u2019s completely unprepared for the very first thing she does, which is to invite Isaac to move in with her and Scott.</p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s not really an invitation so much as an order, and it happens quickly enough that the first Stiles knows of it is when he goes over to Scott\u2019s and sees a stack of boxes in the front hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 are you guys running away to join a circus or something?\u201d Stiles asks, nudging at one of the boxes with his shoe. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re only supposed to take the clothes on your back in that case. Maybe a knapsack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh \u2013 yeah,\u201d Scott says, shifting awkwardly in the middle of the hallway. The awkwardness is noticeable, simply because Scott doesn\u2019t move that way anymore. He\u2019s graceful and smooth, and if he\u2019s scuffling around the way he currently is, it undoubtedly means that Something is Up. \u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott!\u201d Mrs. McCall\u2019s voice punctures their conversation. \u201cWhere did Isaac go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo get his bed!\u201d Scott shouts back.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t stupid. It takes him all of 2.5 seconds to put everything together.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way \u2013 no <i>way</i>,\u201d he whispers furiously. \u201cYour mom is not running a halfway house for delinquent werewolves! Since when?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince she realized Isaac didn\u2019t have anyone watching out for him except Derek, who I think we can all agree sucks ass as an alpha, let alone a guardian,\u201d Scott whispers back. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s probably a little weird \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA little weird!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2013 but it\u2019s not forever! And it might be kind of cool, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Scott continues. \u201cIsaac\u2019s a good guy \u2013 he really had my back with everything that went down, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p><i>I</i> had your back, Stiles thinks mutinously, glaring at Scott with his jaw set. He was the one who drove his freaking jeep into Jackson, after all, single-handedly saving the day.</p>\n<p>Well, sort of. Mostly. Lydia did some stuff, too, but he doesn\u2019t like to think about that because down that road lies heartache and tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo when was this even decided?\u201d Stiles demands, giving another box a shove with his foot. Some might call it a kick.</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s face has guilt stamped all over it, and Stiles doesn\u2019t even really need to hear his answer of, \u201cLast week,\u201d to complete his picture.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you were going to tell me when?\u201d he asks, crossing his arms and giving Scott his very best and most practiced glare. It\u2019s not the best idea, because the side of his face is still sore and achy, and glowering only makes it feel worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be weird about it,\u201d Scott says earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve said something before. But \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be weird, okay? It\u2019s just a temporary thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Stiles mutters. He knows how things go when Mrs. McCall gets her teeth into something. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but on the occasions it has\u2026 Stiles still vividly remembers the summer she decided video games were not a worthwhile summer activity. He and Scott had ended up on every summer sports league in town.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, dude, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles says with a jerk of his shoulder, like he\u2019s hoping he can physically shrug the situation off. \u201cAre we going to play some Call of Duty or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s that guilt again, flashing right across Scott\u2019s face. \u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m supposed to help Isaac unpack. And my mom\u2019s been a lot more chill lately, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s actually forgiven me for the whole werewolf secret identity thing yet, so I\u2019m trying to stay on her good side.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like it\u2019s an unreasonable thing. Scott and Stiles have had to reschedule more than one video game session due to the whims of their parents. But Stiles has a funny, bitter feeling about this one, something that coils low and poisonous in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d is all he says. \u201cAre we still on for tomorrow, at least? Lacrosse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Scott says, and Stiles might not be a werewolf, but he can sense the relief in Scott\u2019s voice. \u201cYeah, absolutely. Pick me up once you\u2019re done with breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles murmurs an affirmation, and that\u2019s that. He could stay and offer to help, he knows, but his entire being is rebelling at just the idea of helping Isaac Lahey move in to the place he\u2019s always considered his second home. It\u2019s petty, probably, and way too territorial for a human being, but his gut reaction is primarily I hate this, and for now, that\u2019s what he\u2019s going with.</p>\n<p>He waves goodbye to Scott and heads for his jeep, wanting to be gone before Isaac gets there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I hear Isaac Lahey is going to be staying with Melissa and Scott?\u201d Stiles\u2019 dad says at dinner that night, a frown creasing his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cTake another scoop of peas, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see you skimping on the greens.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad rolls his eyes, but he takes another helping of peas anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes she realize what she\u2019s getting into?\u201d he presses. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s kind-hearted of her, but taking into account Isaac\u2019s history \u2013 not to mention the year he\u2019s had\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I think Scott\u2019s got her all caught up,\u201d Stiles says, a slightly bitter edge to his voice. It\u2019s not that he wants his dad to find out about everything that\u2019s been going on; he\u2019s not nearly ready for that conversation yet. But seeing the way Scott\u2019s mom is coming around, how much easier things have been between them lately\u2026 yeah, Stiles can admit it. He\u2019s a little bit jealous. At least Scott doesn\u2019t have to lie anymore, while Stiles is still piling up one after another after another.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d his dad says, and he dips a hunk of steak into his mashed potatoes, still ignoring his peas entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cEat those,\u201d Stiles orders, \u201cthey\u2019re good for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He might not be able to share with his dad the current supernatural situation happening in Beacon Hills, but Stiles will be damned if he lets his dad clog his arteries any more than they already are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The Isaac situation isn\u2019t too bad at first, though Stiles is hesitant to admit that, because it feels like as soon as he does things are going to start going wrong. But he\u2019s trying to be honest in his own head, since some days it feels like every other word out of his mouth is a lie, and the truth of the matter is, Isaac mostly keeps to himself. He doesn\u2019t tag along when Scott goes out to meet Stiles, and he doesn\u2019t generally venture out of his bedroom when Stiles is hanging out at the McCalls\u2019 place.</p>\n<p>He makes appearances for meals, according to Scott, but otherwise, he\u2019s either holed up in his room, or out with Erica and Boyd. It makes Stiles wonder if this is maybe the first opportunity he\u2019s had to really sort through what his life has become, and it sparks the tiniest bit of sympathy deep within his chest. They seem to be in a lull right now, after all; it\u2019s as good a time as any to spend some quality time with your thoughts.</p>\n<p>The first time he actually wanders out of his room while Stiles is hanging out is during an intense game of old school Mario Kart, Super Nintendo style.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsaac, hey!\u201d Scott says, taking his eyes off the tv long enough to shoot a friendly grin Isaac\u2019s way. \u201cAre you any good at Mario Kart?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac shrugs, and while Stiles hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off the screen, in his peripheral vision he can see something that looks a lot like smug steal across Isaac\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not bad,\u201d is all he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Scott says, shoving his controller at Isaac. \u201cI\u2019m tagging you in, then, because Stiles is creaming me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles exclaims, the unexpectedness of that exchange making him jerk hard enough to send his driver careening into a wall, losing all the speed he\u2019s built up. \u201cYou can\u2019t just switch out in the middle of a race!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust did!\u201d Scott says \u2013 he practically chirps it \u2013 and scoots over to make room for Isaac. \u201cI\u2019ll play winner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grits his teeth, bites his lip and furrows his brow in concentration, suddenly determined to win this round.</p>\n<p>Of course, because the gods of luck hate him, Isaac turns out to be a freaking god at Mario Kart. He takes Stiles out in under two minutes, and Scott crows victory \u2013 more like howls, really \u2013 and slaps Isaac on the back, gives his shoulders a friendly shake. \u201cThat was awesome,\u201d he says, then holds a hand out to Stiles. \u201c\u2018Kay, dude. My turn!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles silently hands over his controller and moves back to the couch. He does not sulk, because he is practically an adult, but he does feel a certain vindictive satisfaction when Scott doesn\u2019t last more than a minute against Isaac.</p>\n<p>Serves him right.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Somehow, the Mario Kart session opens a door, and suddenly, Isaac is everywhere. He joins them for video games when Stiles heads over, which sucks, because most of their favorite games are two player only. He starts coming to their lacrosse training practices, even though Stiles is the one who needs help, and no, he doesn\u2019t want any help from Isaac, thank you very much. At night, when they\u2019re chatting online, Scott will disappear for long minutes at a time, only to return with a \u201csry dude, isaac was showing me something.\u201d</p>\n<p>The worst though, is when Scott and Isaac start having secret werewolf meetings with Erica, Boyd, Derek and Peter. Scott gets stupidly close-mouthed about them, to the point where he won\u2019t tell Stiles anything; Stiles is pretty sure it\u2019s out of a desire to keep Stiles safe, since Stiles was the one who got all fucked up during the last supernatural showdown.</p>\n<p>This time around, Stiles isn\u2019t even sure how much he wants to get involved. Scott let something slip once about an alpha pack, and while Stiles doesn\u2019t know any details, just the sound of it is terrible enough. Except even if he\u2019s not sure he wants to be one hundred percent involved, he deeply hates feeling so excluded. Scott and Isaac start doing this thing where they break off mid-conversation when Stiles enters a room, and without fail it makes his ears turn red and his heartbeat kick up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Stiles finally explodes, one afternoon when it\u2019s happened one time too many, \u201cyou live together. If your secrets are that important, then have these conversations when I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looks at him, astonished; Isaac\u2019s face is blank.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d Stiles continues, his irritation ratcheting up a notch at the complete lack of response, \u201cfeel free to finish it now. I\u2019m going home. You won\u2019t even have to worry about me overhearing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has his feet shoved into his shoes, and he\u2019s grabbed his wallet and keys before Scott manages a, \u201cStiles!\u201d but by then it\u2019s too late, he\u2019s already out the door and headed for his jeep.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t walk in on any more cut-off conversations after that, but it\u2019s an uneasy truce at best.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Scott and Isaac aren\u2019t the only ones keeping Stiles out of the loop; since that final showdown against Gerard, Stiles hasn\u2019t once seen the rest of the pack.</p>\n<p>Well, he guesses they\u2019re a pack; he\u2019s still pretty fuzzy on the dynamics there.</p>\n<p>It comes as a shock, then, when he stumbles across Derek in the cereal aisle of the grocery store.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shop here?\u201d Stiles asks by way of greeting, his surprise bleeding into his voice.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t even look up, because Derek is, for all intents and purposes, an asshole.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only decent grocery store in town,\u201d he replies, plucking a box of raisin bran off the shelf and flipping it over to examine the nutrition facts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d just be roughing it,\u201d Stiles says. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s had the chance to bait Derek; besides, after facing down Gerard and the kanima and, hell, Peter, Derek just doesn\u2019t seem quite so scary any more.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Stiles continues. \u201cSquirrels. Rabbits. Raccoons. Can you eat raccoons? How come people don\u2019t eat raccoons? You\u2019d think \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek barks, glaring at him over the cereal box. \u201cShut. Up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 anger hits him full-force and all at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me to shut up,\u201d he spits out, taking a step into Derek\u2019s space, then another, and another. \u201cGod, you people \u2013 I\u2019ve come to your rescue how many times now? And you still act like I\u2019m something disgusting you stepped in that got stuck to the bottom of your shoe. I got my ass kicked because of you and your stupid pack \u2013 pushed down a flight of stairs and punched repeatedly in the face and \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles breaks off abruptly, because nobody knows the full extent of that beating at Gerard\u2019s hands. The scrape on his face and the bloody lip were obvious, but he kept the yellow-and-green bruises that had spread along his side from Gerard\u2019s kicks hidden. Jesus, he was lucky he hadn\u2019t broken a rib.</p>\n<p>Derek is looking at him in astonishment; it\u2019s the most expression Stiles has ever seen on his face that hasn\u2019t fallen into the categories of anger, irritation or smug.</p>\n<p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Stiles growls. \u201cI\u2019m done anyway, okay? I\u2019m out. Driving my jeep into Jackson was my last hurrah. Next time you need someone to save your furry butt, don\u2019t bother asking me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He blindly grabs the peanut butter he came into the store for, and he storms the entire way to the cash register.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s putting it away in the cupboard at home that he realizes he got the brand they used to buy \u2013 full-fat, loaded with sugar and sodium and calories.</p>\n<p>His dad is going to be genuinely thrilled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Considering that his anger stays a constant, fizzy presence just below the surface over the next few days, it\u2019s probably a mistake to meet Scott and Isaac for lacrosse. Lacrosse may very well be the one thing Stiles still has left though, and he isn\u2019t giving it up just because his life is full of douchebag werewolves. This is going to be his year, he\u2019s determined to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Scott and Isaac are late, so Stiles tries to work out some of his tension by running wind sprints, but all it really does is leave him out of breath and irritable. When Scott and Isaac finally pull in twenty minutes later, Stiles can\u2019t help that the first words out of his mouth are, \u201cWell, thanks for showing up, guys,\u201d in a snotty tone that\u2019s probably more suited to an eight-year-old than a seventeen-year-old.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Scott grimaces. \u201cWe were \u2013 we kind of got caught up, uh \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPack stuff,\u201d Isaac supplies with a shrug, like that\u2019s all Stiles needs to know. Like that\u2019s all the explanation he deserves.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stiles says, and he feels like his jaw must be clenched tight enough to grind down granite. \u201cJust get your sticks, okay? I\u2019ve been here for twenty minutes, and there\u2019s only so much I can do on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is willing enough to admit he\u2019s not in a great mood, but if Scott and Isaac are picking up on it, then they\u2019re choosing to ignore it. They take their sweet-ass time getting their equipment out of the car, and they\u2019re laughing about something as they make their way over to Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to practice scoring going up against a defender,\u201d Stiles says shortly. They usually let him dictate the practices, since, you know, he\u2019s the only one who actually needs the practice. Normally, he thinks that\u2019s nice, but today it just feels condescending. Pitying.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI\u2019ll take goal.\u201d</p>\n<p>He jogs off to his position, and Stiles calls after him, \u201cNo werewolf tricks!\u201d Scott waves him off, and Stiles fixes a glare to Isaac. \u201cSame goes for you,\u201d he says, and Isaac just smiles a disarming smile.</p>\n<p>Things get off to a bad start almost immediately. Stiles is wound way too tightly to be at all effective on the field, and Isaac is right there in his face no matter what he does. He\u2019s bigger than Stiles, faster than Stiles, and he\u2019s most definitely stronger than Stiles, and it all adds up to Stiles being unable to get close enough to the goal to even take a shot.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said,\u201d Stiles grits out, as Isaac blocks him yet again, \u201cno werewolf powers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Isaac exclaims. He\u2019s smirking. \u201cThis is just me, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something disturbingly like a growl claws its way out of Stiles\u2019 throat, and this time when he goes to make a run past Isaac, he whacks him on the shoulder as hard as he can with his stick.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, whoa, dude!\u201d Scott yells. \u201cThat\u2019s a total foul!\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac\u2019s eyes flash dangerously, but Stiles just stares him down, breathing heavily, fury bubbling through his veins.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d Scott calls again. \u201cDo you need a break, man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says \u2013 almost snarls, really, and if that isn\u2019t a sure sign he\u2019s spent too much of the past year around werewolves, then he doesn\u2019t know what is. \u201cWe\u2019re going again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsaac?\u201d Scott says. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Isaac says in a flat voice. He hardly even <i>flinched</i> when Stiles hit him, stupid werewolves and their stupid powers and their stupid healing capabilities.</p>\n<p>Stiles scoops up the ball, walks maybe twenty feet away, and takes a moment shifting his weight back and forth, trying to determine where he wants to go. A split-second later, he takes off, cleats tearing up the field as he runs full-tilt for the goal.</p>\n<p>Isaac, of course, is right there. Except this time, neither of them is backing down, and neither of them is giving an inch.</p>\n<p>Later on, maybe, Stiles will be disappointed in himself, but for right now, he swings his stick down, intending to trip Isaac with it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another flash in Isaac\u2019s eyes, and in the next moment he\u2019s shoving Stiles. And it\u2019s not the shove of a typical teenage boy; no, this shove has a werewolf\u2019s full-blown power in it, and Stiles goes flying.</p>\n<p>He hits the ground with a dull thump, his entire body jarring badly. Thank God he was wearing his helmet, he thinks muzzily; otherwise, he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019d have a cracked skull.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s unaware of Scott calling his name until Scott is right there next to him, sinking down onto his knees and pressing his hand to Stiles\u2019 chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asks, sounding freaked. \u201cYou went flying, dude, are you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles ignores the pouncing in his head and the ache of his bones and forces himself up. \u201cFine,\u201d he mutters, gently easing his helmet off and trying his best to hide his wince from Scott. \u201cPeachy keen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that out there?\u201d Scott demands. \u201cI mean, Isaac shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve pushed you, but you were fouling him all over the place! What gives, Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat gives?\u201d Stiles echoes, and there\u2019s that fury, finally making an obvious appearance. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Scott, what do you think gives?\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that he\u2019s now a terrifying creature of the night, with huge, terrifying fangs, who could easily tear your throat out and call it a day, Scott still does the best wounded puppy expression that Stiles has ever seen.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m done, okay?\u201d Stiles snaps, struggling to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone\u2026 with practice?\u201d Scott asks, scrambling to stand up, the frown on his face signaling confusion and concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone with everything!\u201d Stiles shouts. \u201cWith all of this fucking werewolf crap, all right, I\u2019m done. Congratulations, you don\u2019t have to worry about running around behind my back anymore, because I am removing myself from the frigging situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott protests, \u201cc\u2019mon, don\u2019t be pissed \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not pissed,\u201d Stiles says, voice cold. \u201cI\u2019m done. You have your new best buddy right there, so just leave me the fuck alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easily the meanest thing he\u2019s ever said to Scott, and the evidence of that is right there in Scott\u2019s expression; he looks like Stiles has punched him, and whether it\u2019s from the shock or not, he actually lets Stiles walk back to his jeep, get in, and drive away.</p>\n<p>The anger starts to dissipate just as quickly as it came on, leaving Stiles feeling numb. And more than a little sick to his stomach. Scott\u2019s been his best friend since second grade, and this doesn\u2019t feel like a fight. It feels like a break up.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t turning his jeep around though, so there\u2019s nothing for it but to head home.</p>\n<p>Seven days later, Stiles still hasn\u2019t spoken to Scott. It\u2019s not for lack of trying on Scott\u2019s part, but Stiles has covered his bases; he\u2019s blocked Scott\u2019s phone number, blocked him from ichat, and he\u2019s even gone so far as to seal a line of mountain ash along the sill of his bedroom window.</p>\n<p>That still leaves the front door, which is a viable point of entry if you\u2019re Scott McCall (although not if you\u2019re Derek Hale), but Stiles has given his dad the short version of their fight, and he\u2019s made it clear that Scott is not welcome here right now.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s pretty sure his dad thinks he\u2019s being ridiculous, but he\u2019s also been prone to giving Stiles his way lately, ever since Stiles showed up after having gone missing for hours, bruised and bloody and shaken.</p>\n<p>Six days cooped up in his room is well past Stiles\u2019 limits, however, and when he hits that seventh day, he knows he has to get out, he has to go somewhere. Preferably, somewhere Scott would never be.</p>\n<p>Which is how he ends up at the Beacon Hills public library. It\u2019s not a particularly well-trafficked place, considering it\u2019s just a tiny off shoot of the nearest city\u2019s public library system, but Stiles has good memories of visiting when he was little. His mom used to take him, and they\u2019d always come out with a stack of books on whatever subject Stiles was interested in at the time.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the smell that hits him, when he first steps in \u2013 papery, a little musty, something lemon-scented underneath, from whatever cleaning supplies they use. The air conditioning must be out again, because it\u2019s warm inside, but the temperature isn\u2019t going to climb past the 70s today, so it shouldn\u2019t get too stuffy.</p>\n<p>Stiles has his laptop and his headphones with him, but he finds himself browsing along the stacks, somehow ending up in the folktale and fairy tale section. The books with \u2018wolf\u2019 in the title practically jump out at him, and after a moment\u2019s deliberation, he plucks a few off the shelves. Not for any particular reason, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019d be helpful even if he did have a reason. He\u2019s just curious as to what he\u2019ll find.</p>\n<p>He grabs himself a table in the back corner and sets to reading. He\u2019s only been at it for twenty minutes or so when he hears someone drag the chair back from the table beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle Red Riding Hood? Really?\u201d a familiar voice asks, and Stiles glancing up to see Danny, who\u2019s looking at him with a half-amused, half-bewildered expression.</p>\n<p>Stiles double checks his book, and sure enough, there isn\u2019t an obvious red hood or wolf in sight on the page he\u2019s been looking at \u2013 it\u2019s a fairly generic picture of a little house tucked into the deep, dark woods.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles says, \u201chow did you even know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny shrugs and slides into his chair. \u201cThat was my little sister\u2019s favorite book two summers ago. I think I read it to her three times a day for a solid four months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like your little sister has good taste, then,\u201d Stiles says, because this story is a lot better than the one he was reading before. The language is rich and descriptive, and even if the backgrounds leave something to be desired, he likes the way the artist has drawn Red Riding Hood. She looks spunky, with her dark, bobbed hair and an upturned ski slope of a nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore you say that, you should know she has since moved on to Justin Bieber,\u201d Danny whips right back to him.</p>\n<p>Stiles considers this for a moment, then nods. \u201cPoint,\u201d he says. Danny smiles and takes out a novel \u2013 the new Stephen King one that everyone at his Dad\u2019s station seems to be reading.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably the second or third best conversation they\u2019ve ever had, and even as a lull settles over them, Stiles finds himself searching for something else to say. He\u2019s been people-starved for days now, and it goes against his very nature to be quiet for so long a period of time. He knows Danny doesn\u2019t like him, but he\u2019s at the point where even negative attention sounds a whole lot better than no attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I know why I\u2019m at the library,\u201d Stiles prompts, \u201cbut why are you here? Just to read?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on break,\u201d Danny says, not looking up from his book. \u201cI\u2019ve volunteered here the past few summers, and this year they finally put me on payroll, which is awesome. It\u2019s just part-time, but it\u2019s decent money for being somewhere I like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Stiles says, curiosity piqued. \u201cSo you\u2019re like a librarian, or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny shrugs. \u201cYou have to have a degree to be a librarian. I do a little bit of everything \u2013 shelving, the circ desk, putting stickers on whatever books come in\u2026it\u2019s cool, means I get first dibs on everything new.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is, you could score me a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey without me having to wait for the waitlist to go down?\u201d Stiles asks, and Danny snorts, chokes a little, even. It feels like a win, like Stiles has somehow scored a point in the game of \u2018Get Danny to Like Me or Die Trying.\u2019 Although the odds of his sudden and most unfortunate demise have significantly gone down ever since Stiles cut out all the werewolves from his life, so maybe he\u2019ll be able to get Danny to tolerate him without even a miserable and prolonged death.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know there\u2019s a waitlist?\u201d Danny asks accusingly, and this time it\u2019s Stiles\u2019 turn to bark out a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, really?\u201d he exclaims. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? \u2018Cause I kind of think it\u2019s the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs again. He\u2019s probably being too loud for the library, but he\u2019s thinking hanging out with a library employee might grant him a pass, just this once.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo where\u2019s McCall?\u201d Danny asks after a few beats of silence. \u201cAren\u2019t you guys usually attached at the hip?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 good mood evaporates. \u201cWe\u2026 had a fight,\u201d he says, his voice suddenly down to a library-appropriate volume. \u201cWe\u2019re not speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny looks like Stiles just hit him over the head with a brick. \u201cYou and Scott?\u201d he asks, voice rich with disbelief. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for you guys to go two hours without speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d Stiles flips to the next page in his book, staring blankly down at it for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been going through some stuff the past year,\u201d Stiles explains. \u201cIt sounds shallow to call it drama, but\u2026 it\u2019s all pretty dramatic, so. And I\u2019m just done with getting sucked into it. I need a break.\u201d He sighs, shoulders slumping down, and he steals a look at Danny. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2013 it isn\u2019t like I\u2019m ditching him in a moment of need. I stuck with him all year, but at a certain point, it\u2019s like\u2026 I need him to be there for me, too. And he hasn\u2019t been. And he has other people to help him out now, so I\u2019m just\u2026 over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It had been fun at first, helping Scott figure out the whole \u2018I\u2019m a werewolf now\u2019 thing, and Stiles hadn\u2019t even minded the occasional rush of adrenaline that came with facing near certain death. But those instances kept piling up, and it\u2019s a little too easy for Stiles to remember how no one had come for him when he\u2019d been taken by Gerard. No one came looking \u2013 Scott didn\u2019t come looking, and Stiles can appreciate that other stuff was going on, but\u2026 Scott is his best friend in the entire universe, he should have come for Stiles.</p>\n<p>When Stiles looks over at Danny again, he\u2019s a little surprised to see that he doesn\u2019t look even a little judgmental. If anything, he looks kind of sympathetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson\u2019s been a complete weirdo for months now,\u201d he offers, unprompted. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen him once this summer \u2013 he\u2019s been holed up with Lydia the entire time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles manages a crooked smile, trying to ignore the niggling guilt that crawls up his spine, as well as the stab of achy sadness that accompanies it. He\u2019s been trying his damnedest not to think about Lydia. \u201cSounds like we could start a club,\u201d he says and gets a mirror of his own smile from Danny. It\u2019s not one hundred percent happy, but there\u2019s a certain solidarity in it, that Stiles can appreciate.</p>\n<p>Danny takes a quick look at his watch and sighs. \u201cI have to get back,\u201d he says, and Stiles nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have my fairy tales to get back to,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks though. For uh\u2026 it\u2019s been\u2026 quiet, without Scott. I\u2019m not good at quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long, long moment after Danny gets to his feet, where he\u2019s looking at Stiles carefully. It\u2019s kind of an intense, frowning look, and Stiles shifts uncomfortably. He\u2019s just about to ask if everything\u2019s okay when Danny sighs, looking vaguely like he\u2019s about to regret whatever he\u2019s going to do next.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna come over?\u201d he asks. \u201cMy shift\u2019s done in a couple hours, I was just going to head home to play video games. So if you think you can kill two hours here, you could just follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, the startled agreement out of his mouth before his brain has quite caught up to the fact that <i>Danny</i> is asking him to hang out. Danny, who has disliked Stiles for as long as Stiles can remember. \u201cYeah, that sounds \u2013 cool. Awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me regret the offer,\u201d Danny says, but he\u2019s kind of smiling as he says it, and Stiles is going to assume that means it\u2019s a joke and not an actual threat.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet me that copy of Fifty Shades, and I promise to be on my very best behavior,\u201d Stiles replies; it gets another chuckle, and Stiles is pretty sure that this whole interaction has upped his score way more than just a single point.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you at two,\u201d Danny says, and Stiles can\u2019t help it, he kind of sits there beaming as Danny heads for the desk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s house is a lot smaller than Stiles imagined it would be. Maybe he expected something more because of the crowd Danny runs with; God knows Jackson and Lydia both have sprawling mansions with pools and ridiculously landscaped yards. Danny\u2019s place, on the other hand, is a cozy-looking two-story house, painted grey with dark, navy shutters. There are two kids\u2019 bikes tipped over in the front yard, and the probable owners of the bikes are darting through a sprinkler, shrieking with laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy brother and sister,\u201d Danny offers, as he and Stiles head up the driveway. \u201cCaroline\u2019s eight, and Parker\u2019s 6.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI always forget you have a brother and a sister,\u201d Stiles says. The kids look like they\u2019re having a blast. \u201cI mean, I know you said earlier, just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re a lot younger than I am,\u201d Danny shrugs. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t like coming to lacrosse games, they get bored.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of going up to Danny\u2019s room, Danny leads Stiles into what looks like a well-loved den. There\u2019s a worn, velvety soft couch, an armchair, and a beat-up old entertainment center that houses a large TV and what looks like a Playstation 3.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s mouth pulls to the side. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026 you know,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You should see the system Jackson has set up, it\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. \u201cWell, first off, Jackson hates my guts, so I\u2019m never going to see his setup. Second, I bet it\u2019s so expensive-looking that I\u2019d be afraid to sneeze for fear of damaging his eight million dollar diamond-encrusted TV stand.\u201d</p>\n<p>That, much to Stiles\u2019 surprise, gets a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo diamonds,\u201d Danny says, but the odd, crooked line of his mouth has evened out to a real smile. \u201cBut yeah, it\u2019s almost too nice, you\u2019re right. Here, you want anything to drink? There\u2019s a mini fridge masquerading as an end table, we have some Coke and Sprite and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opts for a Coke, and he and Danny sprawl out in front of the TV, choosing Mortal Kombat to start with, because Stiles thinks working out some of his aggression and irritation via video game avatar sounds like a great idea.</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s dad comes in with bagel bites about an hour later, Caroline and Parker both on his heels. They immediately grab some of the snacks, then proceed to crawl all over Danny.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off, I can\u2019t see the screen!\u201d Danny exclaims. \u201cYou guys\u2019re gonna make me lose!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep doing exactly what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Stiles orders, thumbs flying across his controller. \u201cJust another couple seconds\u2026 yes!\u201d He raises his arms, victorious, then turns to gloat at Danny, who groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he tells his brother and sister, \u201cyou guys are disowned. I\u2019m giving you away to the circus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caroline just giggles, but Parker\u2019s eyes get wide and scared. \u201cNooooo, Danny!\u201d he yelps. \u201cCircuses have clowns, I don\u2019t like clowns!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould\u2019ve thought of that before you climbed all over me and ruined my game,\u201d Danny says, but he scoops Parker up and slings him upside down over his shoulder, at which point Parker lets out a pretty shrieky giggle of his own.</p>\n<p>Stiles can feel himself starting to smile, watching the scene unfold before him. Caroline leaps onto Danny\u2019s other shoulder, but he catches her easily, not overbalanced at all. That\u2019s maybe what makes him so good in goal \u2013 he always knows where his center is, and he doesn\u2019t let himself be pulled one way or the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cCaroline, Parker!\u201d Danny\u2019s mom calls. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be wearing those wet bathing suits in the house!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoops!\u201d Caroline chirps as Danny sets both of them down. \u201cC\u2019mon, Parker, let\u2019s go back outside!\u201d</p>\n<p>They grab three more bagel bites each, then take off for the great outdoors once again. Danny\u2019s outright grinning as he sits down; it\u2019s the most relaxed Stiles has ever seen him, and while Danny pretty much always looks stupidly attractive, right now he looks soft and open in a way that Stiles isn\u2019t used to.</p>\n<p>It makes his cheeks heat up, makes him swallow uncomfortably, and he reaches for a bagel bite of his own, trying very hard to ignore the sudden coil of tension in his stomach that feels suspiciously like want.</p>\n<p>\u201cRematch?\u201d Danny asks, picking up his controller again, and Stiles nods, relieved his mouth is too full to require a response.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s dad invites Stiles to stay for dinner, but Stiles declines; his own dad is actually going to be home tonight, and Stiles likes to eat with him when he gets the chance.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should do this again,\u201d Danny says, as he walks Stiles to the front door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles agrees, once again helpless to that stupid, beaming smile. \u201cI had fun, thanks. I can bring over my copy of Madden, if you want \u2013 I got the newest one a few months ago, and I\u2019ve hardly had a chance to play it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool,\u201d Danny says, with a smile of his own. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you,\u201d Stiles says with an awkward, twitchy little wave.</p>\n<p>Danny doesn\u2019t live too far, so it\u2019s not even a ten minute ride home, but that\u2019s plenty long enough to send Stiles\u2019 mind reeling. It\u2019s been a long, long time since Stiles has felt so flustered around Danny Mahealani. He has distant memories of first and second grade, when he was kind of fixated on getting Danny\u2019s attention, but after that, he mostly took Danny\u2019s many hints and left him alone. He\u2019s almost jittery, though, already anxious and excited at the prospect of doing this with Danny again. It\u2019s a feeling he only associates with Lydia \u2013 and sometimes with certain werewolves who push him up against walls with more force than is strictly necessary, but he\u2019s always put that down to adrenaline.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no reason for him to be filled with adrenaline now though, no real reason he can think of for his stomach to be in knots, or for his brain to be stuck on Danny\u2019s full-fledged grin.</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s not entirely true. There are reasons, but not ones Stiles has ever spared much thought for. He\u2019s been in love with Lydia since third grade, after all, the kind of consuming, all-encompassing love that eclipses any other glimmers of feeling. Those occasional instances of attraction to other people never measured up when he compared them to the way he felt about Lydia, and so it was easy to dismiss them as something else. Like adrenaline. Or a particular delight at someone\u2019s sense of humor.</p>\n<p>The way he\u2019d felt sitting there with Danny today\u2026 that\u2019s a little harder to dismiss. Stiles wonders if that means he\u2019s really getting it this time, that Lydia isn\u2019t going to pick him, he\u2019s never going to be with her, and it\u2019s time to move on.</p>\n<p>It kind of makes a sad, inevitable sort of sense, although Stiles had always pictured himself moving on to, you know, a girl.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, frick,\u201d Stiles mutters as he pulls into his driveway. At least his dad isn\u2019t home yet, because Stiles\u2019 brain is firing on all cylinders, putting all sorts of little tidbits together, and painting kind of a daunting picture.</p>\n<p>At least this way, he has twenty minutes or so to lose himself in making dinner, so hopefully he won\u2019t be a space case when his dad comes home.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When in doubt, Stiles\u2019 battle cry has always been \u201cTo Google!\u201d Google knows all, provided you can give it the right search parameters, and if there\u2019s one thing Stiles prides himself on, it\u2019s his research prowess. He doesn\u2019t know what Scott and his pack are going to do without him and his mad researching skills, actually, but he also doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s his problem anymore.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ll figure it out.</p>\n<p>Or they won\u2019t, and they\u2019ll die horribly, but Stiles is trying to be a glass-half-full guy here, so he\u2019s banking on them being able to figure it out.</p>\n<p>That Thursday night, two days after he hung out at Danny\u2019s, Stiles finds himself searching out whatever information he can on bisexuality. The more he reads, the more he starts to feel settled and secure, because this is him. This is something he gets, deep down, all natural instinct. It\u2019s like a million things suddenly click into place, and even though it\u2019s only been a few days of angst and deliberation, it feels good to put a label on it \u2013 to find one that fits him.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t feel any great need to act on it; just knowing is enough for now. Besides, Danny is starting to look like the only friend he\u2019s got, and Stiles isn\u2019t willing to jeopardize that for a second.</p>\n<p>Almost like Danny\u2019s psychically tuned into Stiles\u2019 brain waves, he texts just as Stiles closes out of the final Wikipedia page he was skimming.</p>\n<p>\n<b>come over tomorrow for madden?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles grins.</p>\n<p><b>prepare to get your ass kicked</b>, he replies.</p>\n<p>They text back and forth a few times, their threats growing ever more dire, before Danny finally says he has to get his brother and sister in bed, but he\u2019ll see Stiles tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Stiles goes to sleep that night feeling more content than he has since his fight with Scott.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Madden\u2019s a great game, but after playing it for three hours straight, even Stiles could use a break, and this time, he and Danny grab the proffered tray of bagel bites and head up to Danny\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s freakishly neat, is the first thing that Stiles notices. The colors are all dark and rich - navy blue and forest green - ultra-masculine, except that there\u2019s also a poster of Lady Gaga on the wall, which makes Stiles grin, thoroughly charmed.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a stack of SAT prep books by Danny\u2019s bookshelf, and his clearly state-of-the-art computer dominates the rest of the room, perched on a large desk, complete with a hard drive, a printer, and a stack of computer games.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice poster,\u201d Stiles comments, nodding toward Her Gaganess.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister got it for me for Christmas,\u201d Danny says with a fond smile. \u201cI\u2019d actually take Lucille Ball or Judy Garland as my preferred gay icon over Lady Gaga any day, but it was a nice thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too good a segue to pass up, and Stiles clears his throat, gingerly takes a seat on the edge of Danny\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cyour family\u2019s cool with it? I mean, they seem great, and I know you used to have a pretty serious boyfriend, so they must\u2019ve been okay with, uh... you know...\u201d Stiles finishes, making a vague sort of all-encompassing gesture with his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re awesome,\u201d Danny agrees, taking a seat in his computer chair, which looks ten times more comfortable and cushiony than Stiles' own. \u201cI know with some families, they just sort of ignore it, and everyone talks around it - that\u2019s how my ex\u2019s parents were. I'd go over there, and they'd never really look me in the eye, like if they pretended I wasn't there, I'd go away. But mine don\u2019t treat me differently at all, and they\u2019re all about meeting my boyfriends or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <i>is</i> awesome,\u201d Stiles echoes. \u201cDid they see it coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they had it figured out before I did,\u201d Danny says with a shrug. \u201cI knew by the time I was eight or nine, probably, but my mom swears she had her suspicions beforehand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew when you were that young?\u201d Stiles asks, surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you just know. It\u2019s a part of you, right? So... yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if you don\u2019t?\u201d Stiles asks, recognizing that his voice is maybe too interested, a little too intent. Danny looks at him curiously, and so Stiles swallows and presses on. \u201cI mean, what if you... like, what if you spent your whole life thinking you were one way, and then you start to realize that maybe you\u2019re another way, too, only it had never occurred to you to be that way, because you\u2019d always thought you were that first way - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Danny interrupts, looking more amused than irritated, which has to be a good sign, \u201cyou\u2019re not gay. You\u2019ve been obsessed with Lydia for <i>years</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds a lot like Stiles\u2019 dad, enough so that it makes Stiles huff out a quiet laugh. \u201cUm, no,\u201d he says, \u201cnot gay. But... bi, I think. Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBi,\u201d Danny repeats, and now he\u2019s frowning, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know him well enough to know whether it\u2019s a good frown or a bad one.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says quickly. \u201cSo, I know we\u2019re getting along right now and playing video games and stuff, but I mean, you\u2019ve spent kind of a lot of years not liking me. Do you remember why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny doesn\u2019t even look embarrassed as he says, \u201cYou were hellishly annoying the first few years of grade school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Stiles agrees, willing to admit to that much. \u201cI was always around you, right? It was basically a two-year-long campaign of \u2018Pay attention to me.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to look at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I finally <i>stopped</i>,\u201d Stiles continues, \u201cin third grade. When Lydia Martin transferred in, and instead of wanting to be around you all the time, I wanted to be around her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny stares at him, but Stiles can see him processing that information. \u201cOkay, so wait a minute,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that all that time you spent bothering the hell out of me - that was you pulling my metaphorical pigtails?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is... probably accurate, yes,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, until Lydia showed up, and she had <i>actual</i> pigtails, and then it was all sort of downhill from there for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the expression on Danny\u2019s face, Stiles is pretty sure he\u2019s just blown Danny\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he continues, \u201cI was all about Lydia for so long, that I think I just kind of had blinders on for everyone else, you know? But she\u2019s... I mean. I think I finally get that she\u2019s never going to pick me. After everything I did for her this year - after all that she <i>still</i> picked Jackson. She loves him. So. I guess I\u2019m... realizing I have other options, for the first time in a long time. And some of those options have stubble.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, Danny actually laughs, and Stiles feels a little bit of the tension around his shoulders slip away.</p>\n<p>\u201cStubble, huh?\u201d Danny asks. \u201cI <i>knew</i> that line about Miguel being your cousin was bullshit. Also, his name being Miguel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles fishmouths at him, his face flushing, and he finally bites out, \u201cFine, his name is Derek. And Derek is so far off the table I cannot even begin to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh. So\u2026 why was he lurking in your room? You\u2019re trying to tell me that <i>wasn\u2019t</i> some clandestine booty call?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, no!\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cShut up, I don\u2019t even know why I told you all this. I haven\u2019t told <i>anyone</i> yet, I just... needed to say it out loud to someone, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs far as people you would want to tell, I\u2019m a pretty good pick,\u201d Danny says, moving to sit next to Stiles on the bed, their shoulders bumping companionably. It\u2019s nice. \u201cYou\u2019re doing okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI am, actually. Mostly, right now, I want a coming out party. Do we get one of those? I feel like I should get one of those.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny laughs again and shoves at Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cCome back Friday night, okay?\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll pregame, and I\u2019ll take you out. See if we can find you some other hot, stubbly guy for you to sneak into your room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flushes like crazy, but he\u2019s grinning, because that sounds really good. It sounds like fun, and he could use some fun.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cFriday. I\u2019m holding you to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hangs out for another hour or so in Danny\u2019s room, debating movies and music, listening more eagerly than he lets on to Danny\u2019s stories about the lgbtq scene in Beacon Hills which, while small, sounds pretty welcoming.</p>\n<p>By then it\u2019s dinner time, and even though Danny invites him to stay again, Stiles decides to head home. He\u2019s got a lot of things to think about, and some time to himself wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world.</p>\n<p>As soon as he pulls into the driveway, he gets the sense that somebody\u2019s watching him. It makes the hair on the back of his neck prickle, but when he gets out of his jeep, he doesn\u2019t see anyone in the near vicinity. He doesn\u2019t hear anything either.</p>\n<p>He gets his key ready, and he has it in the lock the instant he gets to the door. He\u2019s just turning the knob when he hears a noise, and panic rises sharp and bitter in the back of his throat. He throws the door open and lunges inside, but he\u2019s way too slow, and he hasn\u2019t even begun to slam the door shut before there\u2019s a body colliding with his back, sending him sprawling to the floor.</p>\n<p>Stiles yells and resorts to his preferred method of escape, which happens to be flailing. Sometimes, if he\u2019s lucky, he can score a hit with a wayward elbow or something. Unfortunately, luck doesn\u2019t seem to be on his side right now, because whoever\u2019s on top of him is a whole lot faster than Stiles is, not to mention stronger.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off!\u201d Stiles shouts. \u201cGet <i>off</i> of me, or I swear, I\u2019ll - \u201c</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even have to finish the threat, because the weight on top of him disappears. Stiles hears the door click and the lock turn, and he whips onto his back, squinting up at his assailant.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Scott, and all of Stiles\u2019 panic immediately turns to rage.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he yells, scrambling to his feet. \u201cHoly <i>shit</i>, dude, I about had a heart attack! What the hell was that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t returning my calls!\u201d Scott exclaims. \u201cThis was a last resort, Stiles, I just want to <i>talk</i>. And if I\u2019d let you know I was here, you would\u2019ve slammed the door in my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s... true, but Stiles just scowls, because attacking him out of nowhere is completely crossing a line. Seriously, his heart was on the verge of giving out. It\u2019s still beating faster than it should be, and he knows Scott can hear it, which actually only serves to make him even more irritated.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what there is to talk about,\u201d he grumbles, pushing past Scott and heading to the kitchen to start dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about the fact that you basically threw a tantrum, walked off the lacrosse field, and then ignored me for over a week,\u201d Scott fires back. \u201cHow about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grabs a pot from underneath the stove, fills it with water and slams it down on the burner with more force than is strictly necessary.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, tantrum-thrower, that\u2019s me,\u201d he says. \u201cThrowing tantrums all over the place, no reason for them at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any reason for it!\u201d Scott says. \u201cYou just went crazy - and what was with fouling Isaac like that? You could\u2019ve hurt him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could <i>not</i> have,\u201d Stiles says, and the idea is so ludicrous that he almost laughs. \u201cHoly shit, are you kidding me? He\u2019s a werewolf, Scott, I would\u2019ve broken my lacrosse stick in half before even making a dent in his stupid, thick skull.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a dick to him ever since he moved in - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more than you guys have been dicks to me,\u201d Stiles fires back. \u201cYou have this whole double <i>life</i> going on now, and you\u2019ve done everything possible to keep me out of it - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what I thought you wanted!\u201d Scott interrupts. \u201cYou <i>said</i> - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you know what pushed me over the edge there, Scott?\u201d Stiles asks, brandishing a wooden spoon at him. \u201cHow about the fact that Gerard Argent beat the shit out of me, and you didn\u2019t even come <i>looking</i> for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>That scores a hit; Stiles can see it in the way Scott\u2019s face falls, how there\u2019s an apology stamped all over it. \u201cStiles,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI wanted to - I was <i>about</i> to, and then Derek and Peter showed up, and...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo hours,\u201d Stiles says, and his voice sounds funny to his own ears. A little cracked and rough. \u201cYou could\u2019ve tracked me down no problem, and instead, you let my dad go crazy worrying about me for two <i>hours</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m not saying it was the right one, but I had to - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it had been Allison, there wouldn\u2019t have been any choice,\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cYou would have gone after her the second she went missing.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too true a point for Scott to argue, and they both know it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd I swear to God, if you jump out at me like that again, I\u2019m going to start carrying wolfsbane on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s shoulders slump, and he takes a deep, sad breath, like he\u2019s about to start pleading with Stiles again, but then he frowns instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cArmani?\u201d he asks, taking another sniff of the air. \u201cWhy do you smell like Danny?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at him. \u201cYou have your new friends, I have mine,\u201d he grits out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny doesn\u2019t even like you,\u201d Scott says, sounding surprised, and that\u2019s the last straw, the fact that Scott doesn\u2019t even believe Stiles might have found someone who wants to hang out with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thanks, Scott,\u201d Stiles says bitterly. \u201cI always knew I could count on you to believe in me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, that wasn\u2019t what I <i>meant</i> - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI have dinner to make, you need to leave,\u201d Stiles says, cutting him off. He turns back to the stove to check on the water, adds a pinch of salt and a dash of oil, and ignores Scott\u2019s quiet, pleading, \u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few moments later, and he hears Scott\u2019s footsteps retreat, then the opening and closing of the front door. As soon as he\u2019s gone (because Scott isn\u2019t the type to even think of just pretending to close the door), Stiles slumps over the counter, his palms pressed hard to his temples. He can feel a tension headache coming on, and that is seriously the last thing he needs right now.</p>\n<p>Stupid Scott, and his stupid, earnest, puppy dog face, and if they were fighting over anything else right now, Stiles would have folded like a cheap card table, but he\u2019s too angry for that. He\u2019s too furious and hurt and upset to give even an inch, and he doesn\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to go away, if it ever is.</p>\n<p>So for now, he doesn\u2019t linger over thoughts of Scott. He puts the pasta in, starts preparing a salad, and thinks instead about how he\u2019d better make sure Danny knows he doesn\u2019t have a fake ID, as that is one hundred percent going to affect their Friday night.</p>\n<p>The fake ID, according to Danny, isn\u2019t going to be a problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know the bouncer,\u201d he says with a shrug, \u201che\u2019ll let us in. Besides, once we pick out some clothes for you, you\u2019ll get in no problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, excuse me?\u201d Stiles says, glancing down at himself. \u201cI have clothes. I\u2019m wearing them. What\u2019s wrong with these?\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny smiles pityingly, that sort of look that\u2019s always driven Stiles crazy, and not in the fun way. \u201cYou\u2019re in baggy jeans, a t-shirt, and a hoodie,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my best hoodie!\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to take it off, and then agree to wear whatever I give you,\u201d Danny says simply. His voice is incredibly firm, his arms are crossed, and Stiles knows immediately that this is a losing battle. That doesn\u2019t stop him from grumbling as he sheds the hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going to conjure up these clothes anyway?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cNone of your stuff is going to fit me. Like, not a chance, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny just rolls his eyes. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d He starts digging right through closet, obviously done with Stiles\u2019 protests.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, he emerges with a dark red v-neck that looks like it has a better chance of fitting Parker, and a pair of skinny jeans, the likes of which Stiles hasn\u2019t worn since he left his \u2018trying to emulate Zac Efron\u2019 stage behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says promptly, but Danny just thrusts the items at him. \u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says again, but Danny is insistent.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou either put these on, or I\u2019ll be forced to do it for you,\u201d he threatens, at which point Stiles decides acquiescence is the better part of valor and resigns himself to the stupid outfit.</p>\n<p>The shirt is too tight, just like Stiles knew it would be, and the jeans aren\u2019t much better, but Danny takes one look at him and grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he says, and Stiles knows there\u2019s no point in disagreeing, that Danny is just going to steamroll right over him if he tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you know, I feel violated,\u201d he grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Danny says, amused. \u201cHere, you\u2019ll feel better after shots, give me your glass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles, it turns out, <i>does</i> feel a lot better after shots. He feels that perfect level of warm and fuzzy, where he sort of wants to just hang all over everyone and be <i>close</i> to people. He\u2019s a people person, he is, people are his favorite, and they also happen to make excellent places for him to rest against.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be able to walk there, right?\u201d Danny asks, shades of concern in his voice. \u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019m not carrying you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPsshhhhhhhht,\u201d Stiles says, shoving at Danny\u2019s face. \u201cI have a fantastic tolerance and am a champion walker, do not cast such aspersions on my walking ability.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Because you sound wasted,\u201d Danny says, but he\u2019s grinning. \u201cAlthough I guess if you can use the word \u2018aspersions\u2019 you\u2019ll probably be able to make it the three blocks to the club.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Stiles agrees.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a nice night, a little cooler than it\u2019s been all summer, which is pretty ideal considering the rum that\u2019s flowing through Stiles, warming him up, leaving his skin flushed. He and Danny don\u2019t talk, but for once, Stiles is okay with that, too. The night air smells crisp and clean, and if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he should probably watch where he\u2019s putting his feet, he would want to close his eyes and just breathe it all in.</p>\n<p>He hears the club before they can see it, the air growing thick with ringing voices the closer they get.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I\u2019ll be able to get in?\u201d Stiles asks Danny in an undertone. His nervousness is beginning to creep up on him, make itself known.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Danny says again. \u201cLawrence has a type, and you\u2019re it. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLawrence?\u201d Stiles asks, because who the hell is Lawrence, and why does it matter that he has a type, but that\u2019s when they come into sight of the club, and Danny takes Stiles by the elbow and steers him toward the front of the line.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Rence!\u201d he calls, waving when the bouncer looks up. Lawrence signals for them to come to the front, and while there\u2019s some grumbling from those who have been waiting, Danny ignores it, so Stiles does, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cMahealani,\u201d Lawrence says, giving Danny a slap on the back, hard enough to make him wobble. Not that it\u2019s such an impressive feat, considering Lawrence has got to be six five at least, and seemingly made of solid muscle. He\u2019s got light brown hair, killer blue eyes, and... yeah. Stubble. Stiles shoots Danny a highly suspicious look, which Danny ignores outright. He might as well be humming to himself and twiddling his thumbs, he\u2019s not even <i>pretending</i> to be subtle.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo who\u2019s your friend?\u201d Lawrence asks, those pretty blue eyes raking over Stiles, lingering on the low dip of that v-neck. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen him before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Stiles,\u201d Danny announces, slinging an arm around his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s new - he\u2019s recently figured some things out, made some headway in the self-actualization process.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unless Stiles is much mistaken, Lawrence\u2019s eyes gleam at that, and his smile widens. There\u2019s something vaguely predatory about it, but not in a terrifying werewolf way. More in a way where the only word that comes to mind is \u2018hot,\u2019 and Stiles has already established with himself his enjoyment of getting shoved up against walls, and Danny knows all about his thing for guys who are both attractive and stubbled. So he\u2019s thinking he should probably be more grateful than not for Danny\u2019s machinations.</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows, his throat bobbing with it, and Lawrence laughs. \u201cWell, congrats, Stiles,\u201d he says, then leans in. \u201cI get a dinner break in an hour,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI\u2019ll come find you, buy you a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>For maybe the first time in his life, Stiles is struck speechless, but he retains the presence of mind to nod jerkily, and he\u2019s rewarded with another grin from Lawrence, who then opens the door and waves them inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this shirt have magical properties?\u201d Stiles hisses as soon as they\u2019re in. \u201cAnd also, did you set that up? Are you setting me up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI... may have finagled,\u201d Danny says, looking far too pleased with himself. \u201cSlightly. It\u2019ll be good for you to get your feet wet though! And Lawrence is a nice guy, he isn\u2019t going to push for anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is like eight thousand miles out of my league!\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cHave you not <i>seen</i> him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said, you\u2019re his type,\u201d Danny says with a shrug. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re good-looking. He\u2019s not really out of your league.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles positively goggles at him. \u201cTell that to, oh, I don\u2019t know, every other person in our high school who has shown less than zero interest in dating me in the two years I\u2019ve been going there!\u201d he exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s down to your personality, not your face,\u201d Danny says. He\u2019s grinning, so Stiles knows it\u2019s a joke, but when Danny goes to sling an arm around his shoulders again, Stiles still feels obliged to make a face at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need another drink,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Danny agrees, and he drags Stiles over to the bar, where he makes no move to order anything, just leans up against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Stiles asks, leaning in so Danny can hear him over the pulsing music. \u201cAre you ordering?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo point,\u201d Danny smirks. \u201cGive it a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>And sure enough, a couple minutes later, the bartender is tapping them on the shoulders and sliding two plastic cups toward them, filled with something that smells potent.</p>\n<p>\u201cCourtesy of the two gentlemen down that way,\u201d he says, and Stiles peers down to see two men who have to be at least in their thirties watching them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cthey\u2019re old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Danny agrees, grabbing his glass and raising it down to the guys in a toast. \u201cWhich is why we drink, and then disappear.\u201d He knocks his drink back, and Stiles follows suit. He\u2019s still wincing from the sharp burn of the vodka as Danny grabs him and heads for the dance floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Stiles yells, \u201cI am not your duck on a string!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Danny yells back, but he\u2019s clearly not too interested in the answer, considering the way his gaze is already fixed to the grinding mass of bodies in front of them.</p>\n<p>Stiles is not, nor has ever been, much of a dancer, and he balks a little bit at jumping right into the middle of things. Danny must be an old hand at it though, because he\u2019s smiling encouragingly at Stiles, his body already moving to the music.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s overwhelming there in the center of the dance floor. The music is loud, and the press of bodies around them is hot, and even with the drinks he\u2019s had, Stiles is a little too self-conscious to really let loose. Plus, people keep touching him, which means he keeps jerking himself away, not quite comfortable with the fact that strangers are trying to grope him.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, relax!\u201d Danny shouts at one point, giving his shoulders a shake. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is no longer certain their definitions of fun align, but before he can come up with a response, there\u2019s a delighted yell behind him, and he\u2019s suddenly engulfed in a hug from what must be some sort of bright pink feather monster.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d a strangely familiar voice crows, and Stiles is manhandled around, only to find himself face to face with Ginger.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d he exclaims, positively delighted, and impulsively gives her a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re back, hmm?\u201d Ginger asks over the music, arching one impeccably drawn eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI - yes,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnew it,\u201d Ginger replies, and bops him on the nose. It\u2019s such an unexpected action, so out of sync with the rest of the club, that it startles a laugh out of Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d Ginger continues, \u201cwhat exactly do you think you\u2019re doing here? Dancing? Because if that\u2019s what you call dancing, we have some work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s plenty true, so Stiles just steps back, making room for Ginger and her pink feather boa, as well as the rest of her entourage. And suddenly, Stiles is having fun. Ginger and her friends are every bit as loud and boisterous as Stiles is on his most ADHD-fueled days, and what\u2019s more, they\u2019re not getting all grabby hands with Stiles\u2019 ass. Well, not much, anyway.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not too long before Danny gets pulled away by a handsome blonde with the deepest dimples Stiles has ever seen. That\u2019s fine though, Stiles is pretty content where he is.</p>\n<p>The DJ\u2019s just switched over to what sounds like the beginning of a Ke$ha block when Lawrence suddenly appears, squeezing between Ginger and Mary Lou, a drink in each of his hands. He offers one to Stiles, eyebrows raised, and Stiles takes it without hesitation. Ginger shoots him another look with arched eyebrows, but Stiles gives her a little wave and a smile, at which point she smirks and makes a shooing gesture at him.</p>\n<p>Lawrence is somehow even better looking than Stiles remembers, and the <i>way</i> he\u2019s looking at Stiles makes him gulp his drink a little too fast.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d Lawrence asks, balancing his own plastic cup carefully as he slips closer to Stiles, one hand coming to rest on his hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cA lot better than the one I had earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lawrence looks pleased to hear that, and he starts to rock back and forth in time to the music, nudging Stiles to move with him. He\u2019s still sipping at his drink, but he\u2019s watching Stiles over the rim of his cup, and it\u2019s flooding Stiles with a heat he hasn\u2019t felt since Derek last shoved him up against a wall.</p>\n<p>He drains his drink with a final long gulp, just in time for Lawrence to finish his own. He plucks Stiles\u2019 cup out of his hand, then sets both of them on a nearby table. Stiles hadn\u2019t even realized they\u2019d shifted this far from the center of the dance floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna dance some more?\u201d Lawrence asks, keeping his one hand on Stiles\u2019 hip, then sliding the other around to slip into his back pocket and give his ass a squeeze. It makes Stiles jump, his hands jerking immediately to Lawrence\u2019s shoulders, where he grips tightly. Lawrence doesn\u2019t pull him in again though, and he\u2019s looking at Stiles kind of earnestly, clearly waiting for his reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. His tongue darts out to wet his lips, and he sees Lawrence\u2019s eyes drop down to his mouth, following the motion. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s dance.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the right answer, because Lawrence beams and starts walking Stiles back into the crush of people. It\u2019s hot and sweaty, and Stiles can feel the back of his shirt sticking to his skin, Lawrence\u2019s hand an even hotter brand on his hip.</p>\n<p>The music is low and rhythmic, and each steady bass note seems to bring them closer, until they\u2019re following the lead of everyone around them and grinding together. Stiles takes the opportunity to run his hands up Lawrence\u2019s chest, over the solid bulk of his shoulders and up around his neck. He\u2019s so built and strong, and it feels like he\u2019s everywhere, all wrapped up around Stiles.</p>\n<p>Danny was telling the truth though, because Lawrence doesn\u2019t make any moves to push things further. He\u2019s touching Stiles a lot, but in mostly proper places, and he hasn\u2019t tried to kiss him yet or anything. It\u2019s Stiles, in fact, who finally musters up the courage to cross that line, pressing himself up on his toes and lifting his chin in clear invitation.</p>\n<p>Lawrence accepts, sealing his mouth over Stiles\u2019 in a hot, hard, demanding kiss. It\u2019s leagues away from the single kiss Stiles had stolen one summer at camp, with a cute redhead who looked a lot like Lydia. That had been awkward and sloppy and overall, not that awesome. Lawrence knows very well what he\u2019s doing though,and it\u2019s more than enough to make up for Stiles\u2019 lack of experience.</p>\n<p>It takes a few minutes for Stiles to realize they\u2019ve stopped dancing, and that Lawrence is walking him purposefully toward a dark corner, never letting up kissing him for an instant. Stiles\u2019 back hits the wall with a thump, and a gasp tears out of him, leaving him suddenly dizzy with arousal. It\u2019s mortifying, just how much this is doing it for him, and he squeezes his eyes shut, desperately trying to get his breathing back under control.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lawrence hums, mouth hovering by his ear. \u201cS\u2019okay. You\u2019re doing great - fuckin\u2019 beautiful, Stiles, you know that? How beautiful you are?\u201d</p>\n<p>That statement is so shocking and unexpected that Stiles\u2019 eyes fly right back open. \u201cShould get your eyes checked,\u201d he says promptly, falling back on his default snark. Lawrence\u2019s face is perfectly serious though, his eyes intent, and he gently laces the fingers of his left hand in Stiles\u2019 right, sliding it up the wall over Stiles\u2019 head and holding it there while he leans in for another kiss.</p>\n<p>They keep at it until a distant, tinny beep breaks through the music, and Lawrence groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreak\u2019s over,\u201d he mumbles against Stiles\u2019 mouth, finally pulling away with great reluctance, his hand sneaking down to his pocket where he shuts off his cell phone's alarm. When Stiles blinks, his eyes feel almost too heavy to move, and his mouth has gone numb and tingling.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlready?\u201d he rasps, gaze still stuck to Lawrence\u2019s lips. They\u2019re red and swollen, and Stiles has to wonder if his own look the same. They\u2019re probably even worse, considering Stiles\u2019 fair skin, and oh God, he\u2019s going to have beard burn, isn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lawrence sighs, brushing his mouth against Stiles\u2019 cheeks, his temple, down to his jaw. \u201cUnfortunately. Could keep kissing you all night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels his cheeks go hot with the beginnings of a blush, and he clears his throat. \u201cWhen do you get off?\u201d he asks. \u201cDanny and I... we might stay late, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo thirty,\u201d Lawrence laughs. \u201cPast your bedtime, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Stiles says, and he gives Lawrence\u2019s side a pinch, but it only elicits a grin. Lawrence curves his hand to his cheek and ducks in for one more kiss, surprising a noise out of Stiles with a wet and dirty slide of his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here next Tuesday,\u201d Lawrence murmurs as he pulls away. \u201cI won\u2019t be working. If you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t give a definite yes or no, but Lawrence doesn\u2019t seem to expect one. He just gives Stiles one last grin before he pushes his way back through the crowd to his post at the door.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thing the corner he\u2019s in is dark and comes with a solid wall at his back, because Stiles takes a good five minutes to catch his breath and will his hard on away. He\u2019s hot and sweaty, and he\u2019s starting to see why the guys in these clubs always seem to be without shirts, because his is sticking to him uncomfortably. He can\u2019t stop touching his mouth either, rubbing the pads of his fingers over the prickling, sensitive skin.</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t quite talked himself into walking when the crowd shifts and there\u2019s Danny, heading right toward him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun?\u201d he asks when he reaches Stiles, his grin awfully knowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmph,\u201d Stiles says, which earns him a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready to go? We can stay if you want... I know Lawrence gets off late tonight. It\u2019s your call.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI... um. I - \u201d Stiles fumbles, like his tongue is too thick to form real words. \u201cYeah, I think m\u2019ready. We can go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s expression is a really <i>nice</i> one, and he claps a hand to Stiles\u2019 shoulder, guiding him toward the exit.</p>\n<p>The sharpness of the cool evening air is a punch to the gut. It feels like an entirely different world out here, and Stiles would almost be wondering if this evening had been a fever dream, except for the way so much of his face feels raw.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are going to have some wicked beard burn,\u201d Danny comments, sounding more amused than should be allowed, if you ask Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, your neck looks like you got attacked by giant mosquitoes,\u201d Stiles says promptly, and Danny immediately claps a hand over the hickeys that are forming, bruisey and purple against his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrap,\u201d he mutters darkly, \u201cit\u2019s so much easier to hide them in the winter, I hate summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds so ridiculously irritated, and Stiles finds himself dissolving with helpless laughter against his shoulder. Tonight\u2019s been a good night, he thinks. He feels free, for the first time in a long time. It\u2019s heady, a dizzying rush, and if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he is clearly underage and also clearly drunk, with a father who is an actual sheriff, he thinks he would be crowing about it, tilting his head back and shouting straight up to the stars that there is someone in the universe who thinks he\u2019s beautiful, who wants to kiss and touch him and maybe more.</p>\n<p>They head back to Danny\u2019s, since Stiles already told his dad he\u2019d be spending the night. It felt like the smart thing to do, and considering Stiles\u2019 current state of being, he is going to give himself a pat on the back for that kind of forethought.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d Danny asks once they get back, slipping inside the dark, still house. Everyone\u2019s gone for the weekend, on a trip to Disneyland that Danny had opted out of, so there\u2019s no need for them to be too terribly quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could eat,\u201d Stiles agrees, sliding into one of the stools they have placed along their counter.</p>\n<p>Danny starts making grilled cheese sandwiches, which smell <i>amazing</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo who was that guy you spent the night macking on?\u201d Stiles asks, stealing a piece of cheese to munch on. \u201cIs, uh... anything going on there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny shrugs, slathering butter on one side of the sandwich, then dropping it into the heated pan with a sizzle. \u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not actually looking for anything right now. You know, I\u2019m still sort of... my last relationship was...\u201d He grabs for a spatula and gives the sandwich in the pan a sharp, moody poke.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Stiles says, jumping in with a sweeping general statement. Sometimes though, those are the best kinds of statements, and now is one of those times, if the way Danny sneaks a grateful glance at him is any indication.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Stiles says firmly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry though - you\u2019ll find somebody else. You\u2019re, like - you\u2019re perfect. I mean, you\u2019ve got shitty taste in best friends, we\u2019re all in agreement on that fact, but other than that, you are a perfect specimen of a person, and it\u2019s ridiculously unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d Danny smiles, deftly flipping the grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>\n<p>Stiles gives him a stern, narrow-eyed look. \u201cNot that drunk,\u201d he says, taking care to keep his words as crisp and clean as possible. \u201cI know perfection when I see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEat your sandwich,\u201d Danny says, but he\u2019s looking pretty stupidly fond as he sets the plate down in front of Stiles. He\u2019s even cut it in half diagonally, and Stiles ignores the fact that the cheese is melty and practically bubbling it\u2019s so hot, scoops the triangle up to his mouth and takes a big bite.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhhhh my <i>God</i>,\u201d he moans, uncaring that his mouth is full. If he and Danny are going to be friends, Danny is going to have to deal with the less-than-charming aspects of Stiles\u2019 personality. \u201cOh my God, and you can <i>cook</i>, this is the most amazing grilled cheese I have ever eaten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny slides into the seat next to him and digs into his own grilled cheese sandwich, although he eats his with a fork, like a huge, huge weirdo.</p>\n<p>\u201cSandwiches,\u201d Stiles mumbles around a mouthful of cheesy, buttery goodness, \u201care a <i>finger</i> food, Mahealani.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all of us are heathens, Stilinski,\u201d Danny replies, though he waits until he\u2019s swallowed to do so.</p>\n<p>The sandwiches are gone in a matter of minutes, and then Danny gets them each a glass of water, which they carry up to his room. They\u2019re quiet as they change into boxers and t-shirts, sipping all the while on their water.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, good night?\u201d Danny finally asks, setting his glass on his nightstand and tugging down the blankets on his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cBest night,\u201d Stiles says, and he knows it\u2019s the truth, feels warm and content as he says it. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny grins and climbs into his bed, letting out a slow, soft sigh as he settles down into the mattress. Stiles takes a quick look around and realizes there isn\u2019t an air mattress or a futon or even a sleeping bag in sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh... Danny? Can I go grab the couch in the den? Or do you have an extra blanket, at least? I guess I could sleep on the floor...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can just share,\u201d Danny says sleepily, holding the blankets open in invitation. Stiles\u2019 eyebrows go way, way up, and he\u2019s pretty sure his brain goes all spluttery for a long moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cShare?\u201d he asks, the word sounding more than a bit strangled.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Danny says, and he must be more tipsy than he\u2019s been letting on, because he follows it up with, \u201cBesides, I like to cuddle, and I never get to anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thought of Danny being a cuddle monster is <i>hilarious</i> to Stiles, but he holds back his laughter for fear it might burst out of him in a decidedly hysterical way. Instead, he just crosses over to Danny\u2019s bed, slipping between the sheets and taking care not to cross the invisible line drawn down the middle.</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t have bothered though, because as soon as he\u2019s lying down, Danny flips off his bedside lamp, which throws the room into gloomy darkness, and shifts close enough to Stiles that he can wrap an arm around his waist and tuck his face against the back of Stiles\u2019 neck, one of his legs sneaking forward to get tangled up with Stiles' own.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, you <i>do</i> like to cuddle,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re like an <i>octopus</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cG\u2019night, Stiles,\u201d is all Danny says, and soon enough his breathing has lengthened, deepened, and Stiles can tell he\u2019s asleep.</p>\n<p>Sleep is tugging at his own eyelids, making them feel heavy and scratchy, but he can\u2019t drift off quite yet. This marks the first time he\u2019s shared a bed with somebody since he and Scott were, like, eight, and that means it\u2019s a whole different <i>kind</i> of sharing a bed. It\u2019s nice though, Stiles thinks. It\u2019s warm and safe, and Danny feels a lot like a security blanket draped over him.</p>\n<p>It makes him wonder, not for the first time, if this is something Derek\u2019s pack does. Stiles has spent hours researching, not only werewolves, but wolves and pack behavior, too. So he wonders, sometimes, if they strengthen the bonds between them with touch and nearness, wordless reassurance that they have each others\u2019 backs.</p>\n<p>If they have done anything like this, Stiles has never been invited. But then again, it\u2019s been made quite clear, multiple times over, that Stiles isn\u2019t pack. He isn\u2019t a part of the ties they\u2019ve forged; if anything, he\u2019s just the unfortunate tag along, lumped in with Scott, who never does seem able to commit to being part of Derek\u2019s pack one way or the other.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s fine though, Stiles tells himself, as he snuggles back closer to Danny. He doesn\u2019t have any interest in a pack pile anyway - they\u2019d probably all smell like blood and dirt and dog anyway, and Stiles will take Danny and the scent of his cologne any day, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>With that thought in mind, Stiles takes another deep breath, and finally lets himself go to sleep.</p>\n<p>~*~*~*~</p>\n<p>Stiles volunteers to make breakfast the next morning, since Danny fed him the night before. He prides himself on his breakfast sandwiches, and even though they\u2019re not too terribly hungover, a buttery, cheesy mound of eggs and bacon piled between two slices of toast sounds heavenly.</p>\n<p>Plus, it\u2019s a good activity to hold his attention, keep him focused. He\u2019d woken up half-hard, and while he\u2019d been able to extricate himself from both Danny and the sheets that now smelled like the both of them without waking Danny up, he doesn\u2019t want things to get weird. It\u2019d been better to slip away to the bathroom, splash some cold water on his face, then chirp out to a muzzy, blinking Danny as he\u2019d passed his room, \u201cI\u2019m making breakfast! Fifteen minutes!\u201d</p>\n<p>They eat quickly, spend an hour playing video games, and then Stiles gathers up his things and heads home.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been hoping that extra hour of video games would have been enough time for his dad to go out somewhere - anywhere - but no such luck. His car\u2019s right there in the driveway, and Stiles can hear the hum of the lawn mower from around the side of the house. Sure enough, a moment later, his dad rounds the corner, his face brightening when he sees Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat timing,\u201d he calls out as he kills the mower\u2019s engine. \u201cThe front and the rest of the back are all yours!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you <i>liked</i> mowing the grass,\u201d Stiles protests as he slides out of his jeep. \u201cYou keep saying it keeps you active, keeps you fit! Maybe you\u2019d be allowed to eat more cheeseburgers if you mowed the lawn more often, ever think about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad fixes him with a stern look and turns the mower\u2019s handle toward Stiles. \u201cI\u2019ve got a mountain of paperwork to get through,\u201d he says, \u201cand I <i>distinctly</i> remember the conversation we had where we decided - \u201d He breaks off, frowning at Stiles. \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 hand goes to his cheek, checking or a scrape or a scratch that has somehow ninja\u2019d its way onto his skin. He doesn\u2019t find anything though, and his face screws itself up as he looks at his dad in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll around your mouth.\u201d His dad frowns, motioning to his own face. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve got a rash.\u201d</p>\n<p>It hits Stiles, all at once, what his dad\u2019s talking about, and he makes a strangled noise, his hand slapping over his mouth. Which, now that he\u2019s thinking about it, <i>hurts</i>, because his skin is still irritated from last night and, no doubt, red enough to catch his dad\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny\u2019s, uh... couch,\u201d Stiles says quickly, as soon as he\u2019s removed his hand. \u201cIs very scratchy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lie slips out like second nature, because lying to his dad these days <i>is</i> second nature, as much as it turns Stiles\u2019 stomach to think about. This isn\u2019t anything he\u2019s planning to keep from his dad indefinitely though, he is absolutely going to tell him. He just... wants to do it on his terms, when it won\u2019t have to be accompanied by an explanation of how he spent the previous night making out with a clearly college-age guy at a club he most certainly wasn\u2019t old enough to be in.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis couch,\u201d his dad repeats, and there\u2019s something in his expression that says Stiles hasn\u2019t completely gotten away with his lie, but he\u2019s willing to let it drop. For now.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis couch,\u201d Stiles agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s lotion in my bathroom cabinet,\u201d his dad finally says. \u201cPut some on, and then get back out here. I\u2019ve got some other yard work I need you to do once you finish mowing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles goes immediately; he isn\u2019t going to stick around on the off chance his dad decides to pursue a line of questioning in regards to his alleged couch burn. He finds the lotion easily enough, a brand-new bottle of it, right there on the bottom shelf. He doesn\u2019t think anything of the pink, flowery logo until he\u2019s already cracked the seal and started smoothing it over his skin.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the smell that brings him up short, a scent he remembers from when his mom used to reel him in for a hug and kiss the top of his head. It\u2019s a visceral memory, strong enough to catapult him right back into that moment, like if he turns around, his mom might be standing right behind him, arms open for a hug.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep, shaky breath, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation, finishes applying the lotion. He knows it will wear off soon enough, that he\u2019ll adjust to the scent until he doesn\u2019t even notice it, and that will probably be for the best. For now though, he keeps breathing deep, eyes closed against the assault of memories that come with each inhale.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me, Dad,\u201d Stiles groans, when his dad comes out to remind him that there are still hedges to be trimmed. All told, it\u2019s two o\u2019clock by the time Stiles finally drags his sorry ass inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m showering!\u201d he calls out to his dad, who barely glances up from the paperwork he has spread out over the kitchen table. \u201cAnd then I am ordering the biggest pepperoni pizza in the universe, and it\u2019s all mine, I\u2019m not sharing any of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s paying for this pizza, exactly?\u201d his dad asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so, you can have <i>one</i> piece,\u201d Stiles relents as he clomps up the stairs, \u201cbut you have to pick off the pepperoni!\u201d</p>\n<p>What he\u2019d really love to do is flop straight onto his bed and take the most epic of naps, but he\u2019s filthy, and he\u2019ll pay for any flopping he does now with an emergency load of laundry once he wakes up. Still, his bed is <i>calling</i> to him, and he\u2019s staring at it longingly when he hears a thump outside his window.</p>\n<p>It takes him all of three seconds to cross his room and throw it open, and he\u2019s not even all that surprised to see Derek crouched a few feet away on the roof, his gaze dark and furious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t get near your window,\u201d he says, voice tight. No hi, hello, how are you - nothing like that, and Stiles narrows his eyes and crosses his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be the mountain ash I put in,\u201d he snaps. \u201cAnd considering its sole purpose is to keep unwelcome werewolf-types <i>out</i>, I would say it\u2019s doing its job admirably.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d Derek says, and there\u2019s a little bit of a growl in his throat that has Stiles swallowing hard, for reasons he isn\u2019t entirely prepared to admit to himself just yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, as I\u2019ve told Scott,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cI\u2019m not that interested in a conversation, so feel free to be on your merry way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d Derek snaps, and although Stiles wants to describe his tone as petulant and whiny, there\u2019s a thread of authority there, too, a demand that Stiles feels almost compelled to answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy karma had better be tripling by the <i>second</i>,\u201d Stiles grumbles as he climbs through the window, taking care to keep a few paces away from Derek, who\u2019s still basically glowering at him, like an oversized bat or something. As Stiles is watching him, Derek\u2019s nostrils flare, and an even deeper frown steals across his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <i>reek</i> - \u201d he says roughly, a deep inhale accompanying his step closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing yard work all afternoon!\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cI haven\u2019t showered yet - and if you think this even comes <i>close</i> to your stench at its very worst, you\u2019ve got another thing coming - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Derek growls. \u201cIt\u2019s... people. You smell like other people. Like... like....\u201d</p>\n<p>His expression goes funny, and Stiles tries frantically to think of anything other than last night and the feel of Lawrence pressed against him, or the cocooned warmth of Danny\u2019s bed. Something besides the way Lawrence had gotten him so worked up in that dark corner of the sweaty club, or the morning wood that had greeted him upon waking a few hours ago.</p>\n<p>In the end, he just lifts his chin up, a clear challenge to Derek\u2019s so-called authority.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have non-werewolf friends, thanks,\u201d he grits out. \u201cAnd anything else you might smell on me is none of your business. Now either tell me what you\u2019re doing here, or get out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much do you know about the alpha pack?\u201d Derek asks after a beat. \u201cWhat has Scott told you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh... nothing?\u201d Stiles asks, looking at Derek incredulously. \u201cAre you kidding me? We\u2019re not speaking! God, do you not talk to your pack, like, ever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott isn\u2019t part of my pack,\u201d Derek says, which at least answers the question of the current state of his and Scott\u2019s ever-changing status. Not that Stiles cares.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, fine, whatever,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t telling me anything even before we stopped speaking. I assumed that was a directive from you, by the way. Keep the meddling human away from your ridiculous werewolf drama - which is fine by me, for the record. I\u2019ve washed my hands of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe alpha pack\u2019s been here for a month now,,\u201d Derek continues, as if he\u2019s not even listening to what Stiles is saying, which is way more par for the course than Stiles would like to admit. \u201cThey\u2019ve been keeping quiet, but they\u2019re gearing up for something big. All signs point to them wanting to take us out, eliminate any werewolves before we have a chance to settle in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do they care?\u201d Stiles asks, in spite of his very strict \u2018I do not care, I\u2019m staying out of it\u2019 stance. \u201cYou\u2019re not about to go steal some other pack\u2019s territory, right? What does it matter to them if you just hang out here and mind your own business?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d Derek explains - somewhat patiently, even, considering it\u2019s Derek. \u201cAny new alpha is a potential threat. There are territories that belong to bigger packs not too far from here; if they look the other way while I build a pack of my own, they run the risk of losing their territory. They make themselves vulnerable to attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo don\u2019t attack them,\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cThere, simple. I\u2019ve solved your problem for you. Can you please go now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t care about my intentions,\u201d Derek says, and any trace of patience has disappeared from his voice now. If Stiles didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d say that Derek almost sounds scared. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the hassle of incorporating a new pack. The existing packs have agreements - treaties, I guess you could say. When I lost my family - whatever deals we\u2019d made with surrounding packs dissolved. They don\u2019t carry over unless there\u2019s an alpha immediately in line to succeed, who\u2019s willing to rebuild the pack from the ground up. My sister and I left - and by doing so, we forfeited any right to continue holding territory here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can only gape at him. \u201cThen what the hell were you thinking, building yourself a pack?\u201d he demands. \u201cAre you <i>stupid</i>? If you knew all this, why the <i>hell</i> would you go around biting yourself a new family?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was necessary,\u201d Derek says, his eyes flashing that creepy shade of alpha red. \u201cI had to find out who killed Laura. And I needed the strength a pack offered - which, I might add, came in handy with the kanima - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich was <i>also</i> your fault!\u201d Stiles throws right back at him. \u201cJesus, long-term strategy is really not your strong suit, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Derek growls, shifting toward Stiles in a decidedly threatening way, but Stiles only moves closer to his window sill, poised to tip himself back inside at the slightest provocation. Derek takes notice, and he drags in a deep breath; Stiles watches as he forces the tension from his shoulders, which Stiles kind of only thinks would create more tension, but then again, this is Derek Hale. He probably wouldn\u2019t know what to do without the weight of at least half a world bearing down on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will admit that some of my choices may have lacked foresight,\u201d Derek finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Stiles says, though the words come out a bit faint, most likely due to the shock of hearing Derek admit that he is indeed fallible.</p>\n<p>Derek still shoots him a glare, so it\u2019s not like things are changing too radically.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what\u2019s done is done,\u201d Derek continues. \u201cI can\u2019t undo the bites I\u2019ve given, and they\u2019re not going to negotiate with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Stiles\u2019 frustration gets the better of him, and he gestures wildly with his arms, his words bursting out of him. \u201cSo why are you <i>here</i>, Derek? I\u2019m not pack, and I\u2019m not a <i>werewolf</i>, so what could I possibly even bring to the table right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a long moment before Derek answers, and Stiles is having a hard time reading his expression. His eyes are dark and guarded, and he isn\u2019t giving anything away. \u201cThey don\u2019t know you,\u201d he finally says. \u201cThe Alphas - they\u2019re familiar with all of us, regardless of whether or not we\u2019re shifted. They\u2019d be able to smell Jackson all over Lydia. Scott would never ask Allison to go up against a threat like this, and I\u2019m not willing to bring an Argent into a pack matter anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>And there it is, yet another reminder that Stiles apparently doesn\u2019t feature at all in Scott\u2019s list of priorities. It stings, but Stiles pushes past it, because that isn\u2019t really the issue right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still not clear on what you\u2019re asking here, Derek,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAm I supposed to be some sort of spy for you? Peek through their windows and eavesdrop on whatever nefarious plots they\u2019re cooking up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey want us <i>dead</i>,\u201d Derek growls. \u201cAnd we know <i>nothing</i>. We don\u2019t even know who all of them are, how many they have, and we can\u2019t go into whatever\u2019s coming completely blind!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what, I\u2019m your red shirt?\u201d Stiles asks, edging closer to Derek. There\u2019s a faint trembling beginning underneath his skin - rage, he thinks, seeping up to the surface slow and steady. \u201cSend Stiles, he doesn\u2019t matter. If he makes it back, great, we\u2019ll have some inside information. If not, oh well, he wasn\u2019t important to anyone anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a full five seconds, Derek forgets to glare at him. Instead, he just looks at Stiles with sharp disbelief. Stiles watches as he swallows, his eyes drawn to the bob of Derek\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be in danger,\u201d Derek finally says. His voice is low and intent, and his eyes are intense, fixed to Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m asking, Stiles. They don\u2019t <i>know</i> you. They\u2019re here on pack business, and if they were to harm a human - it would call too much attention to themselves. Attention they don\u2019t <i>want</i>. You\u2019re the perfect person to get close to them - you\u2019re not a werewolf, and you don\u2019t smell anything like pack anymore - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThat\u2019s my answer, okay? No.\u201d</p>\n<p>That disbelief is still there on Derek\u2019s face; it\u2019s possibly even ramped up a notch compared to what it was before, like Derek never for a second believed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to talk Stiles into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you not understand?\u201d Derek demands. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, Stiles, I\u2019m not joking around here - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I know you\u2019re not joking,\u201d Stiles says, and his smile is brittle. \u201cBut I don\u2019t trust you. And you don\u2019t trust me, right? I can\u2019t possibly be your only option; you have a backup plan. And I\u2019m done playing at being hero. Figure it out yourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says urgently, but Stiles has already climbed back inside his room in one swift, fluid motion. He shuts the window with a loud thump before Derek can say another word, then lowers his blinds for good measure.</p>\n<p>He knows Derek\u2019s still out there; he can practically feel the weight of his gaze, even through the wall, but there\u2019s no way in hell Stiles is continuing this conversation any further. He\u2019s done, he is beyond done, he\u2019s not going to throw himself headlong into danger for them anymore. He\u2019s not going to risk losing his life, he\u2019s not going to risk doing that to his dad. He\u2019s finally got his priorities in order, and for once, that means he\u2019s putting himself first.</p>\n<p>\u201cFood!\u201d Stiles chirps. \u201cPizza, wings, fries... there\u2019s some Red Bull in the one bag, too, and cookies...\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad\u2019s eyebrows get even higher, which is surprising, because Stiles was pretty sure they were already at their maximum peak. \u201cSo this food,\u201d his dad says slowly. \u201cIs for...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny\u2019s coming over,\u201d Stiles says, setting the pizza and the wings down on the table with a grunt, then dumping his assorted bags beside them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny,\u201d his dad repeats, lowing his paper. \u201cNot Lydia?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 head snaps up, and he gives his dad the sharpest look in his repertoire. \u201cWhy on earth would you think that?\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause this? Is giving me flashbacks to your Macy\u2019s spree,\u201d his dad replies. He\u2019s grimacing, a little, and Stiles feels his cheeks flood red. Stiles coughs, clears his throat, and gets busy unpacking his bags instead of looking at his dad.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, this is nothing like that,\u201d Stiles says as he pulls out the salsa he\u2019d grabbed - the good, fresh kind that tastes like cilantro and lime. \u201cNot even close. Just two guys, hanging out, playing video games... totally, uh. Casual. And friendly. Very friendly! Not <i>too</i> friendly, I mean, just... we are <i>bros</i> now...\u201d</p>\n<p>He can feel his dad still looking at him, and as a direct result, he can also feel his ears getting hotter by the second.</p>\n<p>\u201cCouch burn, huh?\u201d is what his dad finally says, and Stiles gapes at him, speechless. His dad doesn\u2019t drop his gaze, and after a minute Stiles clears his throat again and ducks his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery scratchy couch,\u201d he says weakly, and his dad sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know you can always talk to me,\u201d he says gently, folding his paper up and pushing himself to his feet. \u201cAbout anything, all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a jerky nod, still determinedly unpacking his groceries, which now that he thinks about it, may have been slightly overkill. By just a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d his dad says. \u201cThen on that note, I am taking a piece of this pizza, and no, I am not picking any meat products off of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that qualifies as emotional blackmail, but he keeps his mouth shut as his dad opens the box and places two huge pieces onto a napkin, because he is a dirty opportunist who clearly does not care at all about the state of his general well-being.</p>\n<p>He gives Stiles a firm tap on the head with his paper though, as he walks past, the kind that manages to feel a lot like \u2018I love you.\u2019</p>\n<p>Once his dad\u2019s out of the room, Stiles takes a moment to survey the results of his shopping. It suddenly seems like way, way too much, and Stiles puts that down to seeing it actually spread out over the table like this, instead of piled into a shopping cart. He\u2019s not trying to woo Danny after all, God, what was he even thinking?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an easily fixed problem, at least, since he can just hide all of the extras away in the fridge and the cabinets. Danny won\u2019t ever have to know the full extent of Stiles\u2019 neuroses, which is absolutely for the best.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s halfway through burying the wings under a bag of carrots (where his dad won\u2019t think to look for them) when his phone buzzes in his pocket with its usual impeccable timing. Stiles has to twist around to get it, since his right hand it currently occupied keeping half of the fridge\u2019s contents from falling out.</p>\n<p>\u201cH\u2019lo?\u201d he says in a strained voice, once he\u2019s got his phone pressed to his ear and is reasonably sure everything is going to stay right where it is, provided he doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, hey, it\u2019s Danny,\u201d Stiles hears, Danny\u2019s voice tinny and full of static, like he\u2019s got a bad connection. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles says quickly, lunging forward with his elbow as a carton of cottage cheese makes a bid for escape. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Danny says, although he sounds annoyed. \u201cYeah, fine. Jackson needs me to pick something up for him from the middle of nowhere. And whatever you\u2019re about to say,\u201d he adds, and they must have a psychic connection thing going on, because Stiles is already opening his mouth to scold him, \u201ctrust me, I\u2019ve already thought it. But he just... sounded like he needed someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, fine, okay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI can put the pizza in the oven, but it\u2019s gonna be your fault if it\u2019s all dried out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got me pizza?\u201d Danny asks, sounding thrilled, and Stiles\u2019 stomach flips over in a distracting sort of way.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd salsa,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut I\u2019m very hungry, so if you\u2019re not here soon, I\u2019m going to eat all of it. Every single delicious, salsa-y bite, Danny.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny laughs, warm and happy right in Stiles\u2019 ear. \u201cSee you soon,\u201d he promises, then hangs up.</p>\n<p>Stiles lets out a quiet sigh and slumps a little, managing to completely forget about all the food he\u2019s keeping stable. It tumbles out of the fridge in a mini avalanche, and he groans, swatting at the bag of carrots. He hates carrots, he doesn\u2019t even know why they have them.</p>\n<p>Trust Jackson to go and ruin a perfectly good night of hanging out. Not that it\u2019s <i>ruined</i> - Danny is still going to come over, and Stiles is more grateful than he has words for that Danny didn\u2019t ditch him completely in favor of his best friend. He could have, so the fact that he didn\u2019t is a good thing, a good feeling. Still, it\u2019s not making Stiles feel any fuzzier in regards to Jackson. Jackson, who\u2019s been completely ignoring Danny all summer, no doubt too wrapped up in Lydia and his newfound werewolfhood and being Derek\u2019s newest lapdog -</p>\n<p>That thought pulls Stiles up short. Jackson texting Danny out of the blue for a vague demand. Derek, who is the <i>Alpha</i>, and Jackson, who is all about currying favor with people in charge.</p>\n<p>The timing is grossly suspect, and Stiles taps a quick text into his phone: <b>where\u2019s jackson sending you again?</b></p>\n<p><b>3605 parker ln</b> Danny sends back, and Stiles pulls it up on Google maps with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an abandoned junkyard on the edge of town, and Stiles swears. He leaps to his feet and slams the refrigerator door shut, ignoring what sounds like more food being knocked from the shelves.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m running out real quick, be back soon!\u201d he yells, then grabs his keys off the table and races for his car. He only has his instincts to go on, but he\u2019s got that awful, sour feeling in his stomach, and a line of tension creeping up his spine.</p>\n<p>The second he\u2019s got his jeep running, backing out of the driveway with a reckless swerve, he\u2019s running through calculations in his head. If Danny called him just as he was leaving his house, then he\u2019s got a good ten minute head start on Stiles, but Stiles has every confidence he\u2019ll catch up. He\u2019s more familiar than he\u2019d like to be with shortcuts through the woods, and besides, he knows where every speed trap in town is.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, he pulls into the parking lot just as Danny\u2019s getting out of his car. He kills the engine and lunges out of his jeep, and Danny\u2019s already turned around, staring at him in bewilderment.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d he asks, a frown appearing on his face. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to leave,\u201d Stiles says urgently.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Danny asks, and that frown isn\u2019t going away. He\u2019s looking at Stiles the way he used to, like Stiles is a huge weirdo who he can\u2019t even begin to comprehend.</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny, we have to leave <i>now</i>,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what Jackson told you, but whatever it was, I can guarantee you he isn\u2019t looking out for you. You have to trust me on this. You <i>have</i> to, Danny, you - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, calm down,\u201d Danny interrupts, and that\u2019s when Stiles realizes he\u2019s clutching at Danny\u2019s jacket, and that he probably sounds a little unhinged.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says hastily, dropping his panicked grip and shoving his hand into his pocket instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Danny says, his voice gentle. \u201cListen, I know it probably seems like a strange request, but would you believe me if I told you it isn\u2019t even close to the weirdest thing Jackson\u2019s asked me to do? Seriously, this is hardly out of the ordinary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny glances around, and Stiles follows his gaze, taking in the lot: mostly empty, but littered with the remains of what used to be a place where people could salvage car parts. There are a few stripped frames, some tires, and a gutted building that looks to be on the verge of falling down. It\u2019s not quite dusk yet, but it\u2019s close, and the long shadows give the whole place a decidedly sinister feel.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat exactly did Jackson ask you to do?\u201d Stiles asks after a long beat.</p>\n<p>Danny shrugs, and Stiles can\u2019t remember ever being this naive about situations that are clearly life-threatening. \u201cHe said I needed to pick something up for him,\u201d he says. \u201cThat there\u2019d be some people here? I swear, if this turns out to be steroids, I\u2019m going to kick his ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t even manage a smile, his brain racing a mile a minute. He knows Derek needs information, that he wants a general idea of what he and his pack are going to be up against. An abandoned lot on the outskirts of Beacon Hills seems like a reasonable place for a group of temporarily nomadic Alphas to establish a home base, and if this is where the Alphas are, Jackson wouldn\u2019t think twice about sending Danny here on a wild goose chase. The Alphas would know the instant someone set foot here. Stiles can see the scenario play out in his mind. They\u2019ll come out to investigate, Danny will ask for a mysterious package, the Alphas will put it down to a miscommunicated drug deal and send Danny on his way. Then, when Danny gets back, Jackson can pick his brain about how many people he saw, what did they look like, where did they come from, gleaning whatever details they can from the information Danny offers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the stupidest plan Stiles has maybe ever heard, and that includes those plans of his own that have turned out to be legendarily awful, but he\u2019s equally sure he\u2019s <i>right</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny, let\u2019s go,\u201d he tries again. \u201cForget the steroids - the <i>last</i> thing Jackson needs is anything he would be getting from a shady as fuck transaction on the edge of town, okay? Let\u2019s just - please. Please, can we get out of here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pleading, he can hear it in his voice, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care because Danny\u2019s expression is softening, and he\u2019s reaching out to clasp Stiles\u2019 shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Danny says, his fingers a warm, firm pressure, even through Stiles\u2019 hoodie. \u201cYou\u2019re totally right. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Stiles says, this hugely relieved smile breaking across his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know - seriously, good choice, excellent life choice, I\u2019m applauding you so much right now - \u201d</p>\n<p>He breaks off as he glances away from Danny, because there\u2019s suddenly a person standing ten feet away from them. Stiles startles badly, because holy shit, he showed up out of <i>nowhere</i>, that same creepy move that Derek likes to pull. The person is a man, six and a half feet tall at least, and since he\u2019s not wearing a shirt, Stiles can easily see that his muscles practically have muscles of their own.</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny,\u201d Stiles whispers, and he knows Danny\u2019s seen the guy, too, because Danny has gone very, very still. \u201cDanny, when I say go, run for my Jeep, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLeaving so soon?\u201d a voice breaks in, and Stiles and Danny both whirl around, only to find that a woman has snuck up behind them. She\u2019s tall, but slim is the wrong word to use on her; Stiles would go with lean, because even from here, he can see that she\u2019s all muscle. Her brown hair looks thick and coarse and is streaked with gray, and her skin is weathered, adding probably an additional five years to her actual age.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, leaving, we were just on our way out,\u201d Stiles says quickly. \u201cTook a wrong turn, had to stop to regroup, but we are now good to go, so... you folks have a good night, and we\u2019ll just - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d the woman says, and Stiles has no idea how she manages to make a fairly mild tone sound so deadly. Stiles gropes for Danny\u2019s arm, latching onto it tightly, and he\u2019s just about to make a break for his jeep when the woman smiles at them.</p>\n<p>She already has her canines out, and Danny\u2019s sharp inhale turns into an outright gasp when her eyes flash red.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d she repeats, and Stiles whimpers. He is going to kill Jackson and Derek for this.</p>\n<p>Provided, of course, that he and Danny make it out alive.</p>\n<p>The night\u2019s another cool one, the air crisp and the wind biting, but Danny is a steady warmth at Stiles\u2019 side.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d he whispers, because that\u2019s right, he doesn\u2019t know what these people are, has no idea that they\u2019ll be able to hear every word he breathes. \u201cStiles, what\u2019s - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Stiles announces, taking a protective step in front of Danny, wanting to keep him shielded from the very serious threat in front of them. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything, okay? He doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this, he doesn\u2019t even know what you <i>are</i>...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I think that cat\u2019s out of the bag, don\u2019t you, Stiles?\u201d the woman smirks, and Stiles heart sinks, because of course she was paying attention, and now she knows exactly who he is. It isn\u2019t like there are any other kids named Stiles in Beacon Hills. Her eyes go back to red, and this time they stay red; Stiles feels Danny shrink in on himself a bit at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to know,\u201d she says as she stalks toward them, every inch a predator, \u201cis why you\u2019re here. Why the two of you are trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not trespassing,\u201d Stiles says, because apparently he is missing that thing also known as a sense of self-preservation. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your territory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re holding it,\u201d the male alpha says, his smile full of terrifying, glinty white teeth. his voice is low and dark, rough, like maybe his throat has been damaged from years of constant growling, even though Stiles knows well enough that werewolves can heal from anything. Or almost anything, at least. He\u2019s keeping his distance, almost observing, which makes Stiles think he might only be there as extra muscle, just in case anything goes wrong. \u201cThat makes it ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m going to ask one more time,\u201d the female says, crossing those last few feet until she\u2019s right in front of Stiles, deliberately invading his personal bubble. She flicks out a hand to reveal her claws, and Stiles feels more than hears Danny\u2019s moan. He knows she\u2019s felt it, too, when she smiles and lifts the tip of one claw to Stiles\u2019 throat. \u201cWhy,\u201d she says, bringing her mouth to Stiles\u2019 ear, \u201care you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteroids,\u201d Danny bursts out, before Stiles can even scramble for something he could pass off as a lie. \u201cI - I swear to God, my friend wanted me to come pick up a package for him - I am ninety-nine percent sure it was for drugs. Of the performance-enhancing kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can tell that the answer catches her off guard, because she almost looks amused as she flicks her gaze over to Danny, lingering on him for just a moment before her eyes slide back over to Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not lying,\u201d she says silkily, \u201cbut then again, I hear he doesn\u2019t know anything about all this. I\u2019m sure he believes what he\u2019s saying, but that doesn\u2019t make it the truth. So why don\u2019t <i>you</i> tell me what\u2019s going on, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Stiles says, swallowing shallowly in an attempt to keep his skin from being pierced by that ultra-sharp-looking claw. \u201cI swear, I found out Danny was coming here, and I had a bad feeling about it, so I went after him.\u201d</p>\n<p>She moves fast, so fast that Stiles can\u2019t even mount a struggle as she grabs him by the collar and throws him down to the ground, banging his head sharply against the ground and then holding him there with one pointy-tipped hand pressed to the back of his neck. Stiles aims to stay silent, but he knows his ragged breathing gives away his mounting sense of panic.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more time, Stiles,\u201d she says, placing a knee none-too-gently in the middle of his back for good measure. \u201cWhy the hell is Hale sending human members of his pack to spy on us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not pack,\u201d Stiles spits out, ignoring the gritty burn against the side of his face as he tries to turn his head enough to look at her. \u201cI\u2019m not pack, and neither is Danny, and neither of us are <i>lying</i>. You\u2019d know it, if we were.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re pack,\u201d she murmurs, pressing her knee harder into Stiles\u2019 back, until he has to resort to a choked gasp for more air. \u201cYou don\u2019t think we weren\u2019t observing Derek and his puppies long before we alerted him to our presence? You\u2019ve been keeping your distance lately, but you were right in the thick of things before, and the bonds of a pack run deeper than a teenager\u2019s temper tantrum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Temper</i> tantrum,\u201d Stiles croaks. His face is starting to go red, he can feel it, and the pressure on his back isn\u2019t letting up, not for a second. \u201cNo, I\u2019m done, I\u2019m out, there isn\u2019t anything binding me to them anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leans in close, her nose pressed to Stiles\u2019 hairline, and takes a deep breath. \u201cYou smell like Hale,\u201d she say, her voice like a purr. \u201cI\u2019m an Alpha, Stiles, you can\u2019t hide anything from me. You saw him recently, and I want to know what, precisely, you discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d Stiles spits out, and he hears an outraged snarl the instant before she\u2019s hauling him over onto his back and letting her fist fly at his face. It connects with his left cheekbone, the same place Gerard had focused his attack, and Stiles panics, flailing wildly in a desperate scramble to get away. She\u2019s so much stronger than he is though, stronger by far than Gerard, and she\u2019s not letting up, not for an instant.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Stiles gasps, clutching at her arm, but she shakes him off with ease and hits him again. \u201cSt-stop, wait, <i>please</i> - \u201d</p>\n<p>To Stiles\u2019 everlasting surprise, it\u2019s the last punch she throws, and she pulls abruptly away from him with another snarl. She whirls around, and Stiles dizzily props himself up on his elbows to see why.</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s standing a few feet behind her, pale and terrified, with a massive, bloodied rock in his hand. Now that he\u2019s looking at the back of her head, Stiles can see a similarly bloody gash near her temple.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says, and in the instant before she lunges, teeth bared, he grabs for her arm. \u201cI swear to God, we don\u2019t know anything,\u201d he pleads. \u201cAnd even if we <i>were</i> spying - you got the drop on us. You win. Just let us go. You - you don\u2019t want the blood of two sixteen-year-olds on your hands, do you? Are you really gonna be that kind of a monster?\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s looking at him now, her eyes red and her expression wolfed out - moreso than Derek\u2019s ever gets, which Stiles has a feeling means she\u2019s been an Alpha that much longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Stiles repeats, his voice dropping down to a hoarse whisper.</p>\n<p>After a long, long moment, her face morphs back to a human one, although her eyes stay that glittering, dangerous shade of red. \u201cTake a message back to Hale for me,\u201d she says, and Stiles nods woozily. His face is throbbing, and his vision is starting to swim a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the message?\u201d</p>\n<p>She takes his left wrist in her hands, then snaps it, a brutal, efficient movement, and Stiles screams at the sudden pain. She watches him with an emotionless expression, and as soon as his scream dies away, she says, \u201cTell him that if he tries a stunt like this again, he won\u2019t be getting his pet human back broken - he\u2019ll be getting you back in pieces.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gulps back a sob, but it breaks free from his throat anyway. He curls in on himself protectively as she stands up, and he watches as she crosses to her fellow Alpha, who at some point had shifted behind Danny - probably about the time Danny whacked her with that rock - clearly ready to attack if he saw a need. They don\u2019t look back, they just melt into the surrounding forest together, and that\u2019s when Danny finally stumbles forward to Stiles\u2019 side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour wrist is broken,\u201d he says, panic in his voice. \u201cYou - and your <i>face</i> - holy shit, Stiles, what was that? What - her <i>face</i> - and their eyes - Stiles, what\u2019s going <i>on</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>The pain is so sharp in his wrist that Stiles is feeling dangerously close to puking all over Danny, but he forces himself to sit up, his left hand tucked against his chest, while his right clutches weakly at Danny\u2019s arm. Danny seems to take the hint and wraps an arm around Stiles\u2019 waist, practically pulling him to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019sorry,\u201d Stiles slurs, slumping against Danny\u2019s shoulder. \u201cS\u2019werewolves. You can\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy, okay, you <i>saw</i> them, and I - I\u2019ll explain everything, but - in th\u2019car, please, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Danny agrees, his voice shaking. \u201cYeah, you need a - a hospital, and we should - okay, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo hospital,\u201d Stiles argues as they start back toward Danny\u2019s car. God, he really doesn\u2019t want to leave his jeep here, but it\u2019s not like he can drive it with a broken hand, and it makes more sense for them to take Danny\u2019s car, he guesses. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m okay, we should - we need to go to Derek\u2019s first. Do you know where that is? The old Hale house?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Danny says, but he sounds uncertain, wary. \u201cBut Stiles... isn\u2019t that, um, dangerous? I mean, if - if Derek\u2019s one of - one of <i>those</i> - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn Alpha,\u201d Stiles says, as Danny holds the door open for him and he slides into the passenger seat. He waits while Danny goes around to the driver\u2019s side door, but as soon as he\u2019s in, Stiles continues. \u201cHe\u2019s an Alpha. And he\u2019s a terrible one, he\u2019s a complete dumbass, but he isn\u2019t dangerous. Not - not to you or me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Danny asks. He turns the key and his engine rumbles to life, and almost immediately he\u2019s whipping out of the lot, driving faster than is probably safe on these twisty back roads. \u201cHow do you know we\u2019ll be safe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a deep, steadying breath and tries his best to push his body\u2019s many aches and pains out of his thoughts. \u201cScott\u2019s a werewolf,\u201d he says. \u201cSo is Jackson. And Erica, Isaac, Boyd... they\u2019re all in Derek\u2019s pack. I mean, Scott isn\u2019t right now - he sometimes is, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a frigging soap opera, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson,\u201d Danny repeats, stealing a look at Stiles. His face is still terrifically pale, like none of the color has bled back into it yet. \u201cJackson\u2019s a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe used to be a were-lizard, but then he got better. I mean, relatively, I guess. And before you ask, he completely brought it on himself. <i>He</i> went after it, he begged for the bite, so it\u2019s his own damn fault he\u2019s caught up in all this. And I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s his fault that you\u2019re involved now, and I am so <i>sorry</i> you\u2019re involved, Danny, God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you saying me going home and just... forgetting about everything that happened tonight... that\u2019s off the table?\u201d Danny asks weakly, and it almost sounds like on some other day, in some other instance, it could be a joke, but in this particular moment, it falls flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Stiles repeats, wincing as he shifts and jostles his wrist. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think - it\u2019s complicated, and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll leave you alone, I can\u2019t guarantee that. We just... we need to talk to Derek, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Danny says, and the trust that\u2019s there in his voice is enough to make Stiles feel sick again. Stiles can\u2019t even protect himself; he can\u2019t be watching out for Danny, too.</p>\n<p>They drive in silence for another few minutes, but it\u2019ll take them at least another fifteen to get to Derek\u2019s place, which is across town. Stiles swallows against the nausea he can feel building in his throat, a combination of physical pain and receding adrenaline.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think you could start at the beginning, maybe?\u201d Danny finally asks, breaking the silence. His eyes are on the road, his hands curled perfectly at ten and two on the steering wheel, but there\u2019s nothing at all relaxed about him. \u201cFill me in on the details?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYeah, I can do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019ll be a good way to pass the time and fill the silence, and Stiles has been aching for so long to tell someone. Even if he hates himself a little for putting this weight on Danny, of all people, it\u2019s a relief, too, to finally share it with someone outside the pack. So he starts with that night in the woods, when he and Scott so stupidly went looking for a dead body, and takes Danny all the way through the end of the school year. It spills out in a steady stream, and it feels like Stiles doesn\u2019t take an actual breath until he\u2019s told Danny everything.</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s silent, but he finally lets out a slow breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Jackson,\u201d is the first thing he mutters, and Stiles huffs a quiet laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if I don\u2019t kill him first,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m his best friend, I get dibs,\u201d Danny insists.</p>\n<p>Stiles manages a small, tight smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he says, as Danny makes the turn onto Derek\u2019s property. He\u2019s outwardly pretty composed, but inside he\u2019s a jumble of fear and anger, and he\u2019s not quite sure what he\u2019s going to do once he gets inside.</p>\n<p>He and Danny walk up the path to Derek\u2019s front door, shoulder-to-shoulder. It\u2019s been weeks since Stiles was here, and he\u2019s surprised to find that it looks kind of habitable. Granted, minimally habitable, since odds are one good gust of wind could still send it tumbling down, but the porch has been swept free of debris, and there are a few lights shining through the windows, which look marginally cleaner than the last time Stiles saw them.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we knock?\u201d Danny asks, but Stiles just shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d he says; he\u2019s proven right an instant later, when the front door flies open and Derek comes out, glare already in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d he demands, \u201cwhat\u2019re you...\u201d</p>\n<p>He trails off once he catches sight of Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cWhat the hell happened,\u201d he says, not really letting it be a question. He clatters down the front steps, but Danny steps between them before he can get too close.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis wrist is broken,\u201d Danny says, and Stiles can\u2019t help the rush of warmth he feels, how nice it is to have someone stick up for him for once, even if Danny is shaking a little. He knows he\u2019s standing up to an Alpha right now though, so Stiles doesn\u2019t blame him for a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened,\u201d Derek demands again, and the pleasant warmth Stiles was feeling a minute ago gets replaced with that anger that\u2019s been keeping him company all summer long.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he echoes, stepping around Danny and glaring up at Derek. \u201cYou tell me, Derek. Whose bright idea was it to send Danny into a freaking <i>Alpha</i> den without even telling him what he was getting into?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks so completely stunned, that Stiles knows he has his answer right there. \u201cJackson,\u201d he mutters to himself, and he storms past Derek, straight into the living room.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a threadbare couch and a patched chair that wasn\u2019t there before, but nobody\u2019s sitting in them; instead, Scott and Isaac are on their feet, lurking just a few feet away from the door, while Jackson is hovering in front of the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Danny doing here?\u201d Jackson demands, at the same time Scott says, \u201cStiles? What <i>happened</i> - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you,\u201d Stiles says, his voice coming out cold and furious as he glares Jackson down. \u201cI know you\u2019re not the brightest crayon in the box, but this was stupid even for you, Jackson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson bristles, because even when he\u2019s so blatantly wrong, he\u2019s never taken well to being spoken to like that - especially not from Stiles, of all people.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about sending Danny to the lot - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>exactly</i> what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Stiles snapped. \u201cYou sent him in <i>blind</i>, they could have torn him apart if they\u2019d felt like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not monsters, they wouldn\u2019t have harmed an innocent human,\u201d Jackson snarls, but Stiles only makes the most disparaging noise he can possibly muster.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking <i>moron</i>,\u201d he says, to which Jackson growls and starts toward him. Before he gets more than three steps, there\u2019s a terrifying roar from behind Stiles\u2019 left shoulder that sends Jackson to his knees, leaves him cowering.</p>\n<p>Stiles turns around to find Derek halfway to wolfed out, canines bared and eyes red as he glares Jackson into submission.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t authorize anything like this,\u201d Derek growls, his gaze fixed to Jackson.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles challenges, lifting his chin defiantly at Derek. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I believe that, actually, considering your most recent plan was to send your <i>pet human</i> to do your spying for you.\u201d He practically spits the words out, and Derek actually winces. It just makes Stiles think that his face must really look terrible, because it\u2019s a rare thing for Derek to even admit he\u2019s wrong, let alone look guilty about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek - <i>Danny</i>,\u201d Jackson says, something placating and pleading in his tone. \u201cI thought it was foolproof. Danny and I haven\u2019t hung out - not since I became a werewolf - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d Danny mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201c - and their problems are with <i>us</i>, not some human who wandered onto their territory by accident! They had no reason to hurt him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept that they\u2019ve been watching you,\u201d Stiles says coldly. \u201cEverything you do, they <i>know</i> you. I think they probably took the time to sniff out your one and only friend, Jackson.\u201d Jackson\u2019s eyes flash that crisp, beautiful blue, the color that Derek\u2019s eyes used to be, but Stiles holds his ground, looking down at Jackson from his moral high ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles told me everything,\u201d Danny interjects. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone, I swear, but I don\u2019t want any part of this. I have a little brother and a little sister - I\u2019m not doing anything that runs the risk of hurting them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s expression is <i>awful</i> upon hearing that - some terrible mix of grief and guilt and rage, and Stiles has to swallow and look away. He forgets, sometimes, the mountain of shitty things Derek has been buried underneath. It doesn\u2019t excuse the stupid things that Derek sometimes does, but it sure as hell evokes some serious sympathy, and Stiles isn\u2019t in the mood to be sympathetic right now. Even if it is Jackson\u2019s fault, a part of Stiles still wants to lay the blame directly at Derek\u2019s feet, whether that\u2019s fair of him or not.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet, following Danny\u2019s words, until a very soft, \u201cStiles,\u201d from Scott breaks the silence. When Stiles looks up, Scott is approaching him slowly, his hands practically held out in an \u2018I come in peace,\u2019 gesture. \u201cI\u2019m going to call my mom,\u201d he says gently. \u201cShe can look at your wrist, decide if you really need to go to the hospital or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a jerky nod, ignoring the way his face gives another throb of protest at the action. \u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott disappears into the kitchen to make the call, and Stiles\u2019 eyes find Danny once again. \u201cYou should go,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cYou should - Jackson should drive you. You can make him grovel all the way back to your house.\u201d It\u2019s a sign of just how fucking in the wrong Jackson is that he doesn\u2019t even growl or protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou going to be okay?\u201d Danny asks. He crosses over to Stiles, his face creased with concern, and brings his hand up to Stiles\u2019 injured cheek, brushing his fingers so lightly across the bruise there. Stiles hears a swallowed noise from someone in the room, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care, since Danny\u2019s <i>right there</i> and touching him oh-so-carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Stiles whispers back, although his voice breaks unconvincingly over the word.</p>\n<p>Danny doesn\u2019t call him on it though, just wraps his arm gently around Stiles\u2019 shoulders and draws him in for a hug. \u201cYou were a complete badass,\u201d he murmurs, lips brushing right against Stiles\u2019 ear, and oh, this isn\u2019t fair, it is not fair that this is happening in a room full of werewolves. \u201cThanks, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, any time,\u201d Stiles says as Danny pulls away. He\u2019s itching to reach up and run his own fingers over his ear, all the places Danny touched him, but he resists the impulse and instead gives a little wave as Jackson steps forward. Danny\u2019s expression narrows, going cold and distant, the way he sometimes looks when he\u2019s playing goal and the other team\u2019s fouling like crazy; it\u2019s what Stiles has dubbed his \u2018I am about to send you home crying to your mother\u2019 look, and he\u2019s never once seen it turned on Jackson.</p>\n<p>Stiles has a feeling Jackson is in for a deeply uncomfortable car ride.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019ve left, Stiles takes a deep breath and makes for the couch. Scott isn\u2019t back from his phone call yet, and Isaac has disappeared somewhere in all the drama, leaving just Derek, who\u2019s still doing his usual glowering thing from the corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Derek says, crossing the room to stand in front of Stiles. Stiles goes tense, and he feels his heart start to beat faster, just from Derek\u2019s proximity.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, and his voice is positively bitter. \u201cI expect you want a report, right? Whatever details I picked up while trying not to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <i>get</i> it, do you?\u201d Stiles explodes, his breath hitching in a familiar and terrifying way. \u201cYou\u2019ve <i>always</i> had your stupid werewolfian genetics to fall back on, you have no idea what it\u2019s like to be human, to know that you\u2019re one stray bullet away from death.\u201d His breathing\u2019s gone shallow and fast, mimicking the tempo of his heart, and Stiles is starting to feel lightheaded with it. It\u2019s not new, he knows it\u2019s the start of a panic attack, one of the kind that hit him out of nowhere and without warning, but he can\u2019t quite pull it back, he can\u2019t get it under control.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any idea what that would do to my dad?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019d <i>kill</i> him, Derek. He\u2019s already lost my mom, he can\u2019t lose me, I can\u2019t <i>do</i> that to him. I can\u2019t,\u201d and he cuts himself off with a shaky gasp. It\u2019s all downhill from there, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s right back in those days after his mom\u2019s death, when it felt like he could never catch his breath, when his chest was always tight and constricted, too weighted down to get a proper lungful of air.</p>\n<p>He hates that Derek\u2019s there, that Derek\u2019s watching him crumble like this, but Stiles can\u2019t do anything to stop it. It\u2019s like a trainwreck in slow motion, and his wrist hurts, and his face hurts, and he can\u2019t <i>breathe</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d he hears Derek murmur, and the next thing Stiles knows, Derek\u2019s kneeling down in front of him, his hands settling on the couch on either side of Stiles\u2019 legs. \u201cStiles, breathe with me, can you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>For more than a few minutes, Stiles can\u2019t. He can\u2019t get it together enough to follow the pattern Derek\u2019s giving him, he\u2019s too lost in the crush of his own panic. What it finally takes is Derek settling against the arm of the couch and gently tugging Stiles between the vee of his legs, which leaves Stiles\u2019 back pressed to Derek\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe with me,\u201d Derek repeats, and this time Stiles can <i>feel</i> the pattern Derek is offering, the slow and steady inhale, the two beats of holding his breath, then an equally lingering exhale. Stiles is shaking by the time he\u2019s got a handle on it, and he feels utterly wrung out, but at least he <i>can</i> breathe again.</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Derek doesn\u2019t move away; instead he reaches for Stiles\u2019 wrist, carefully curling his fingers around the area that hurts most. Stiles\u2019 instinct is to jerk away, but after a second he\u2019s glad he didn\u2019t, because through some ridiculous form of werewolf voodoo, the sharp ache that\u2019s been lingering ever since the female Alpha took a dislike to his bones remaining in one piece dissipates.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles murmurs, and he reaches up with his other, uninjured hand to wipe at the tacky sweat that\u2019s drying along his forehead. He shifts, preparing to move away from Derek, but Derek\u2019s arm slides up to his chest, tightening there to keep him in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s unexpected enough to freeze Stiles right where he is. He feels Derek sigh, the tickle of an exhale against his ear, and then the rise of Derek\u2019s chest as he inhales. \u201cI never meant for Danny to get involved, or for you to get hurt. The only reason I asked in the first place... we\u2019re desperate, Stiles. This is our territory, but they\u2019ve already got us on the defensive. I didn\u2019t ask you to get us information because you\u2019re dispensable. I asked because you\u2019re smart. Because you\u2019ve saved us - saved <i>me</i> - more than once. Because I never for a second thought they would hurt a human.\u201d</p>\n<p>He moves his hand from Stiles\u2019 wrist to the bruise on his face, and the pain leeches away from there, too. He\u2019s not healed; his cheek still feels stiff when he turns his head, and his wrist isn\u2019t bent in the right direction, but the pain\u2019s muted, for now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pack,\u201d Derek says, and before Stiles can protest, he barrels on. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t mean I get to demand you to put your life on the line, and it doesn\u2019t mean you <i>owe</i> us anything. It does mean that it\u2019s my job to protect you. And this?\u201d he says, his thumb stroking along Stiles\u2019 cheek once more, before falling away, \u201cis never going to happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 heart is jackrabbiting again. Not like it was while he was having the panic attack; more like the way it\u2019s been racing whenever he gets too close to Danny lately. Or the way it had felt determined to beat its way out of his chest when Lawrence had been pressing him up against that dark corner, lights and music and warm bodies all around them.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t anything Stiles wants to examine too closely, not when <i>Derek</i> is the cause, and so he swallows hard and carefully extricates himself from Derek\u2019s hold. This time, Derek lets him go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d Derek asks quietly, his eyes their usual burst of color - hazel, Stiles guesses, with not a trace of red to be found.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says hoarsely. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>And for the first time in the weeks since Gerard took him, since he had to watch Matt strike his father, since all of this supernatural craziness has invaded his life, he\u2019s surprised to find that he\u2019s not lying. He\u2019s not fine, maybe, not yet, he isn\u2019t good or great, but he\u2019s okay. He\u2019s all right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m gonna go find Scott,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI - I think we could probably use a talk, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just nods, which makes sense, since he\u2019s probably used up his daily word allowance on the things he told Stiles, but Stiles doesn\u2019t feel any anger at it. It\u2019s just Derek, and for once, he\u2019s said the things that needed to be said. That Stiles needed to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles adds, and before the moment can turn too sappy, he gets to his feet and heads for the kitchen, where he knows he\u2019ll find Scott.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~*~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Scott asks warily, and he sets his phone to the side, eyes on Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, taking the seat across from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Mom said she\u2019d be here in fifteen,\u201d Scott adds, his gaze dropping to Stiles\u2019 wrist. \u201cShe might still want to take you to the hospital though, she didn\u2019t sound too pumped about the idea of having to set a broken bone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles says, and he sounds exhausted to his own ears at just the thought of spending the evening in a hospital, letting some doctor poke and prod at him. His dad\u2019s going to be thrilled to get that call, he\u2019s sure, and Stiles is going to have to think up another lie to explain it to him, not to mention...</p>\n<p>\u201cOh crap,\u201d Stiles groans, rubbing at his temple. \u201cMy jeep. My <i>jeep</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Scott demands. \u201cWhat about your jeep - what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still at that stupid lot,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cAnd I swear to God, if those fuckers lay a single <i>claw</i> on it...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it,\u201d Scott says earnestly, even though this is one of those times where, if things were normal, he\u2019d maybe be teasing Stiles about his possibly unhealthy attachment to his piece of crap car. All good-natured though, because Scott knows the history behind it, knows about the jeep Stiles\u2019 mom used to have, how this one isn\u2019t an exact match, but it\u2019s damn close. How Stiles had come across it two weeks before he\u2019d turned fifteen, and even though he couldn\u2019t drive yet, had begged his dad to get it. Had practically had a power point presentation ready to go, except Mr. Stilinski hadn\u2019t really needed the convincing; his eyes had just gone soft, and for the next year and a half, the jeep sat in their driveway, where Stiles washed it every two weeks like clockwork.</p>\n<p>It makes Stiles\u2019 chest go tight again, just thinking about what those Alphas could do to his baby, and that\u2019s when Scott gets to his feet and moves close enough to give Stiles\u2019 shoulder a firm squeeze.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it,\u201d he says firmly. \u201c<i>I\u2019ll</i> get it. I - consider it my apology. Or like, part one of my apology.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives him a decidedly sideways glance, a slight frown on his face. \u201cDo you even know what you\u2019re apologizing for?\u201d he asks, because he wants things to get back to normal, he wants his best friend back, but he has no interest in making it easy for Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor not upholding my end of the best friend bargain,\u201d Scott says slowly, like he\u2019s taking his time in choosing his words. \u201cYou\u2019ve been going above and beyond ever since I got the bite, and I... I\u2019ve been slacking, dude. And that sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t get that you have a lot on your plate,\u201d Stiles says, because he feels like he needs to make that clear, maybe. He doesn\u2019t want to be the overly needy, clingy best friend, after all. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s the werewolf thing, the being in love with the daughter of a hunter thing, the failing all your classes thing - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not failing <i>all</i> my classes,\u201d Scott interrupts, but he\u2019s smiling. It feels good, seeing that smile, knowing that Stiles is the one who put it there.</p>\n<p>\u201cNinety percent of your classes,\u201d Stiles amends. He takes a deep breath, trying to line up in his head all the reasons he\u2019s been so angry. He\u2019s been too run by his emotions lately, he hasn\u2019t been thinking, just <i>feeling</i>, so it takes him a moment to figure out what to say next.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just need you not to forget about me,\u201d he finally murmurs, not quite looking at Scott, because this is veering way too close to \u201cheart-to-heart\u201d territory, and that is not how Stilinski men do things. Ever. \u201cJust - if I get kidnapped, it\u2019d be nice to feel like I was actually on your radar. I mean, I guess we\u2019re all now aware of what a huge freaking liability I am - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a liability,\u201d Scott breaks in again, but his smile\u2019s gone now, replaced with a frown. \u201cAre you kidding me, Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is on the verge of making a sarcastic comment, but the thought dies at the look on Scott\u2019s face. \u201cUh, no?\u201d he says after a beat. \u201cI got kidnapped and beaten up by a guy, like, five times my age, who doesn\u2019t even <i>have</i> any supernatural powers. And then the way you and Isaac and everyone cut me out afterward...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that\u2019s what you wanted,\u201d Scott says, his frown deepening. \u201cYou got all distant, and my mom said you probably needed to not feel like you were in mortal danger for awhile.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just stares at him, his tongue pressing against the inside of his cheek, then says in a low, rough voice, \u201cI figured you just thought I was useless now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before he even realizes what\u2019s going on, Scott\u2019s yanking him into a hug - still mindful, luckily, of his broken wrist. It happens quickly enough that Stiles doesn\u2019t even have time to flail before he\u2019s trapped against Scott\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not useless,\u201d Scott says fiercely. \u201cYou\u2019re, like, the <i>opposite</i> of useless, Stiles. Wasn\u2019t Derek just begging you for help a couple days ago? It\u2019s because he knows we\u2019re better with you than without you. And, dude, I sometimes think about all the people I could\u2019ve hurt, if you hadn\u2019t stuck by me the first few times I transformed, and...\u201d He trails off, and his arms go tighter around Stiles, leaving Stiles with no real choice but to let himself relax into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you,\u201d Scott says, voice gritty and hoarse and all the more real for it. \u201cAnd I miss having my best friend around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have Isaac now,\u201d Stiles says, voice muffled against Scott\u2019s shoulder. As soon as the words have left his mouth, he winces, because God, how obvious is <i>that</i>? He\u2019s basically got \u2018pathetically jealous\u2019 stamped all over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsaac\u2019s a good dude,\u201d Scott says, finally pulling away, but his hands slide up to Stiles\u2019 shoulders instead, keeping him close, forcing Stiles to look at him. \u201cHe\u2019s fun, and he\u2019s been wearing way less leather lately, thank God, but he\u2019s got nothing on you, Stiles. He never wants to stay up all night watching sci-fi movies and eating Doritos, for one. And he\u2019s totally scared of my mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m scared of your mom,\u201d says Stiles, and somehow there\u2019s a crooked smile that\u2019s made its way onto his face. His shoulders feel just a fraction lighter, too, not quite so bowed down anymore. \u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> scared of her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Scott says, \u201cbut you still crashed your jeep into her car when I needed you to, you know? I mean, you know that dumb saying, right? About how your best friend won\u2019t be able to bail you out of jail, because they\u2019ll be sitting right there with you? That\u2019s you, dude. That\u2019s us.\u201d He gives Stiles a little shake, but his expression isn\u2019t silly or lighthearted; he\u2019s serious, more intent than Stiles has maybe ever seen him. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re probably going to be the reason we\u2019re in jail in the first place, but I made my peace with that a long time ago. You\u2019ve got my back, Stiles, and I\u2019ve got yours. Always.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s what Stiles remembers Scott saying about Isaac a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s easy enough to remember how his anger had flared up inside of him, quick and brutally hot. Now though, it\u2019s just the memory; in this moment, he\u2019s not feeling any of it, not even a flicker.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles finally says, that last bit of tension unwinding from his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna be better about having your back,\u201d Scott says, and he goes in for another hug, because apparently this is that kind of conversation.. \u201cI just forget sometimes, you know? To worry about you. You\u2019re really good at taking care of yourself and saving all our asses - sometimes I forget that you don\u2019t have super powers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is, I\u2019m actually Batman,\u201d Stiles says, not quite lighthearted, but getting there. \u201cYou\u2019re Superman, and I\u2019m Batman, and nobody\u2019s Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody\u2019s Robin,\u201d Scott agrees. Stiles can feel him smiling, and when they finally pull apart, there\u2019s still a beaming grin on Scott\u2019s face. Seeing it there makes Stiles feel like things are okay again, which makes him that much more reluctant to bring up something that might make it disappear.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout the Alpha Pack,\u201d Stiles says slowly. \u201cI mean, I understand why you weren\u2019t telling me anything about them now - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your choice,\u201d Scott says. \u201cIf you want to opt out, that\u2019s fine, Stiles. No one\u2019s going to think less of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson will,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd probably Boyd and Erica. Isaac, maybe, Lydia...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Scott cuts in. \u201cI\u2019ll fight them. For your honor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, see, I\u2019m not actually a damsel in distress,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cso - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, dude. And besides, we <i>get</i> it.\u201d Scott looks at him steadily, his eyes dark and serious. \u201cAllison\u2019s been training to fight off scary monsters since she could walk, and I still freak out about her having to go up against something nasty. And Jackson - I think he\u2019s on the verge of forbidding Lydia to come to any more pack meetings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. \u201cRight, good luck with that, Whittemore. Lydia Martin is a goddess among women and cannot be tamed.\u201d It stings, a little, the mention of Jackson and Lydia, but not nearly as much as he expects. Maybe not even as much as it should, and he can tell that Scott picks up on it, because he\u2019s back to frowning curiously at Stiles again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get all sad,\u201d he says, taking an obvious sniff; Derek clearly still hasn\u2019t been able to train any subtlety into him. Scott should be required to temporarily join the pack for that alone. \u201cWhen I mentioned Lydia just now - you didn\u2019t get sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>It will forever be unfair that Scott can smell emotions or whatever, and Stiles shuffles awkwardly, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, purposely drawing the word out. \u201cAbout that...\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott stares at him, and then his eyes widen in surprise. \u201cYou still smell like Armani,\u201d he says, almost accusingly. \u201c<i>Danny</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot specifically,\u201d Stiles says hurriedly. \u201cAt least. Um. Not yet. But I\u2019m, uh... exploring. Some new options. By which I mean I may have made out with a guy at a club the other night. And, uh, liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure Scott will be okay with it; he\u2019s never had any problems with Danny, after all, but even when Stiles would make a joke about being attractive to gay men, or wanting to make out with Scott, he knows Scott never once took him seriously. Which means Scott has probably never even entertained the possibility of Stiles being bisexual, and Stiles doesn\u2019t quite know what to expect in a reaction.</p>\n<p>It still comes as a bit of a shock when Scott yanks him right back into a hug, which means they\u2019re up to a truly ridiculous number of hugs for a single conversation, and Stiles is definitely going to protest the next one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you anyway, dude, and I am totally cool with you wanting to date other dudes,\u201d Scott announces, and Stiles bursts out laughing because it sounds like something Scott may have read off the back of a pamphlet. It\u2019s sincere though, Scott <i>means</i> it, and when he starts to pull away from Scott - probably wondering why Stiles is laughing at him - Stiles just tightens his own arms, taking care to keep his wrist well out of it, and keeps Scott trapped in the hug for a while longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, Danny\u2019s awesome,\u201d Scott adds, as soon as they\u2019re once again back in their own little personal bubbles, each of them claiming a seat at the table. \u201cIs he, uh... is he into you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs, his gaze falling to a knot on the surface of the table. He runs his thumb over it, his nail catching on a jagged edge in the middle of the swirl. \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hanging out a lot, but... yeah, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, good luck!\u201d Scott says brightly. \u201cAnd hey, he knows about werewolves, but isn\u2019t one - you guys totally have that in common now!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s such a ridiculous summation of this entire day that Stiles snorts and drops his head to the crook of his elbow. \u201cYes, good, just what I was looking for in a boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>A silence blankets them, but it\u2019s a nice one, a settled one, and they don\u2019t break it until Scott sits up, the movement abrupt. Stiles can practically see his ears perk up.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s here,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get her - you stay here, all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Stiles agrees, because where the hell else is he going to go?</p>\n<p>Scott wavers though, for the moment after he gets to his feet, and it\u2019s not until Stiles quirks an eyebrow at him that he speaks. \u201cAre we okay? Or at least, uh, close?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. He has to clear his throat, because it suddenly feels a little bit tight. \u201cYeah, buddy. We\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>It gets a grin, a flash of white teeth, and then Scott is taking off for the front door.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Scott says, as Stiles\u2019 is climbing into his mom\u2019s car. \u201cGive me your keys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles goes all squinty-eyed at him, which prompts an eye roll from Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor your jeep,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll run over and get it, then come meet you at the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that Stiles doesn\u2019t want his jeep back; he wants his jeep back very badly, in fact, and leaving it in an abandoned lot for the foreseeable future reads like an invitation for his father to start asking some pointed questions about what Stiles has been doing with his time. The thought of sending Scott alone, however, makes his stomach twist, and he hesitates, teeth worrying at his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be <i>fine</i>,\u201d Scott says, holding his hand out and making a \u201cgimme\u201d motion with his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake Derek with you,\u201d Stiles finally says, digging his keys out of his pocket and holding them out to Scott. \u201cI swear, you don\u2019t want to mess with these Alphas, okay? Take Derek, and don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott just smiles, plucking the keys from Stiles\u2019 fingers with something like glee - probably because Stiles never lets anyone else drive his baby. Ever. Not even Scott. \u201cSee you in twenty minutes,\u201d he promises, then lopes back up to the house, hopefully to get Derek. Mrs. McCall emerges from the front door just as Scott hits the porch, and Stiles watches him press a quick kiss to her cheek, his lips moving in what\u2019s probably a thank you. Mrs. McCall manages a smile, but to Stiles, it looks strained, full of worry. She doesn\u2019t say anything though, just runs a hand through Scott\u2019s hair and makes her way down the rest of the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d she calls as she approaches the car, and Stiles nods, finally bringing his legs inside and tugging the door shut.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They made him turn his phone once he left the waiting room, and Stiles is itching to check it, to make sure everything\u2019s okay. The instant he\u2019s got his cast on, he excuses himself to go find Scott, leaving his dad to deal with the list of instructions on proper cast care, which is honestly kind of redundant at this point, because Stiles has had broken bones on multiple occasions, he\u2019s practically an expert on them by now.</p>\n<p>When he makes it to the waiting room, though, it\u2019s empty, except for a middle-aged woman who has a hand wrapped around her stomach and is looking faintly green, and a young father with a baby who won\u2019t stop crying. Stiles takes a second look around, slower, but there\u2019s no Scott to be found.</p>\n<p>He spots Mrs. McCall emerging from a hallway out of the corner of his eye, and he jogs over to her, trying his best to keep his panic at bay.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201cis Scott here? Is he with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, eyebrows ticking up. \u201cShould he be? I thought he was getting your jeep - he probably left it at your house.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles bites back his disagreement, because there\u2019s no sense in worrying Scott\u2019s mom needlessly. Scott hasn\u2019t told her anything about the Alpha Pack; they\u2019d had to explain away the broken wrist with a thoroughly embarrassing explanation of yet another fantastically clumsy moment in the life of Stiles Stilinski: ie, the time Stiles had pulled off to the side of the road to help a stray dog, which had conveniently run off when Stiles had managed to trip over his own feet and tumble down the steep incline, snapping his wrist when he\u2019d thrown his hand out to break his fall. It had been the only thing they could think of to account for the bruise and scrape along his cheek as well, and Stiles kind of hates the fact that Mrs. McCall and his own father had bought it hook, line and sinker.</p>\n<p>Mrs. McCall\u2019s eyebrows are moving higher with every second Stiles doesn\u2019t answer though, so he quickly says, \u201cRight, yeah - you\u2019re probably right. I\u2019ll just... give him a call later.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wheels away from her quickly, turning his phone back on as he heads back to his dad. There aren\u2019t any missed calls, no voicemails or text messages, which actually concerns him more than if there had been some. At least then he would know what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p>He runs into his dad halfway down the next hallway; his dad sighs when he sees the bright blue cast, and he slings an arm around Stiles\u2019 shoulders, heading in the direction of the parking lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d his dad asks. \u201cWe could stop for burgers on the way home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Stiles says quickly. \u201cI was feeling kind of queasy earlier, actually, with the pain and all, so I\u2019m thinking I might just make a sandwich at home. And you have to get back to work anyway, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell... yeah, I have some things I need to finish up,\u201d his dad says. \u201cBut only if you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t need me to stick around. You going to be okay for a couple hours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, completely,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cSeriously, just drop me off at home, I\u2019ll probably get a sandwich and go right to sleep, I\u2019m wiped out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d his dad agrees, and they\u2019re quiet the rest of the way home, although Stiles can\u2019t stop himself from fidgeting. There are a million things that could have happened; Scott might have forgotten the plan to come to the hospital, or else gotten distracted with something. Maybe the Alphas took his jeep somewhere, and Scott\u2019s spent all this time looking for it. Or maybe Allison called him up and wants to get back together; Stiles can\u2019t even really blame him if that\u2019s the case, because he\u2019s pretty sure that Scott\u2019s higher brain functions cease functioning whenever Allison acknowledges his existence.</p>\n<p>Still, his stomach sinks when they pull into the driveway and Stiles\u2019 jeep is nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Scott was getting the jeep for you,\u201d his dad says, frowning, and Stiles takes a deep, meant-to-steady breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably took it for a joy ride,\u201d he says, popping the door open and hopping out. \u201cJerk. I\u2019ll call him - go finish your work, okay? And no stopping by McDonald\u2019s for dinner - I\u2019ll <i>know</i> if you\u2019ve had something terrible and artery-clogging.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d his dad says with an eyeroll of epically teenage proportions. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take those pain meds, all right? Love you, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you, too, Dad,\u201d Stiles says, and as soon as his dad and the patrol car are out of sight, he takes off for his room, dialing Scott\u2019s number as he goes.</p>\n<p>The phone rings once, twice, three times, and then Scott\u2019s voicemail kicks in.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott!\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cWhere the hell are you, man? I\u2019m back from the hospital, where <i>you</i> were supposed to be - call me back as soon as you get this, okay? Because I am kind of freaking out here, and I swear to God, if you went and used my jeep to pick Allison up and win her back, I am going to kick your ass, do you hear me? <i>Call</i> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws his cell down on his bed, feeling jittery enough that he knows sitting down isn\u2019t going to last. He paces the room instead, gnawing at his thumb nail and wondering what the hell he should do next.</p>\n<p>Stiles is just about to try calling Isaac, instead, when he hears a thud from downstairs. He goes flying down the staircase, at a speed that presents a real hazard to his newly-casted wrist, and skids to a stop in the front hall, keeping an ear out for another burst of noise that he can zero in on.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a second thump, coming from the kitchen this time, and he forces himself to a slower pace, wishing all the while that he had a baseball bat with him. Or perhaps a considerably more lethal weapon. He\u2019d take one of those, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d he calls out as he approaches the kitchen. \u201cScott?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s gotten dark, but he can hear a sort of scuffling sound, and he grasps blindly for the light switch, a small yelp escaping him the instant he\u2019s flipped it, because there is half a person sticking through the kitchen window. All Stiles can see is a pair of black motorcycle boots and dark grey jeans, and he grabs for their biggest butcher knife before he realizes who those jeans belong to. Or, to be perfectly honest, who that ass belongs to.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek?\u201d he asks, voice strangled. \u201cAre you serious right now? What the hell do you have against <i>doors</i>, you creep! You - \u201d</p>\n<p>He breaks off as Derek slides down to the floor, landing in a crumpled heap and leaving a smear of blood all along the windowsill. He struggles to sit up, and Stiles makes a choked noise as he takes in the state of Derek\u2019s chest. His shirt is in tatters, revealing four deep score marks, like a set of claws ripped their way through his skin.</p>\n<p>The wounds aren\u2019t healing, and Stiles knows exactly what that means.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek?\u201d he repeats, his voice barely a whisper, and Derek\u2019s eyes flutter, taking a good thirty seconds to actually focus on Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got Scott,\u201d Derek mumbles. \u201cI couldn\u2019t - too many - they took him. Y\u2019need to call the pack - get everyone here. Figure out what t\u2019do.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slumps back against the wall, like he\u2019s all out of energy to keep himself upright, and Stiles spends half a second quietly panicking before his brain manages to shut out all that white noise and zeroes in on what needs to be done.</p>\n<p>First things first; he shoots a text to Isaac, a demand to round up the rest of the pack and bring them all to Stiles\u2019 house, because now is not the time for any of them to be alone. Second, he pulls Derek up and half-carries him as carefully as he can to the living room, where he deposits him gingerly on the couch. Derek leaves a trail of blood all along the kitchen tile and the carpet, and Stiles can only imagine all the blood he\u2019s going to get on the couch, but Stiles will just have to figure that out later.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s unconscious by the time Stiles slides a pillow underneath his head, and it\u2019s only then that Stiles realizes his hands are shaking, that he feels like he\u2019s about to be sick. If Derek\u2019s hurt this badly, Stiles doesn\u2019t even want to think about the state Scott\u2019s in - or the state he\u2019s about to be in, if the Alphas do, in fact, have him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, buddy, c\u2019mon,\u201d Stiles murmurs, resisting the urge to put his hands on Derek\u2019s shoulders and shake him awake. \u201cWake up. This is your chance to prove what an awesome Alpha you are, okay? I need you right now - <i>Scott</i> needs you, so you have to get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no response, nothing but the slow, shallow rise of Derek\u2019s chest to indicate that he\u2019s still alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says to himself, his voice shaky. \u201cOkay. Time to call Dr. Deaton.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a stroke of luck that Deaton answers, and he swears he\u2019ll be there in ten minutes. Ten minutes for Deaton, then, possibly less for the rest of the pack, provided Isaac actually got Stiles\u2019 message and passed it on to everyone else.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes, then, to wait. Stiles can do that. He can absolutely do that. He drags an ottoman next to Derek\u2019s head, then sits right beside him, where he can keep an ear out for the quiet, barely-there rhythm of his breathing. His own heart is pounding, loud in his ears, but he focuses on Derek\u2019s breathing instead, like if he pays enough attention, it will keep Derek alive.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes until help arrives.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes until they can start working on how to save Scott.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes.</p>\n<p>Stiles buries his face in his hands, takes a deep breath, and sends a silent prayer up to whoever might be listening to help keep his panic at bay for just ten more minutes.</p>\n<p>Derek comes to with a pained gasp. It\u2019s probably Stiles\u2019 fault; he\u2019d been trying to get a better look at the damage the Alphas had done to Derek, but Derek\u2019s shirt is... <i>sticking</i> to his wounds in awful, horrible ways, and when Stiles goes to lift it up, he finds another gouge along Derek\u2019s side curving around his abs and disappearing toward his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, no, calm down,\u201d Stiles says as Derek tries to force himself up to a sitting position, a hurt and frustrated sound tearing out of him. \u201cDerek, just <i>relax</i>, okay? The rest of the pack is on their way, there\u2019s nothing you can do right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek subsides, but there\u2019s a decidedly furious glower on his face. Stiles would like to think it\u2019s not directed at him specifically though, so much as the situation they\u2019re in.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d he asks, leaning in closer. He feels too much like he\u2019s looming, which is strictly Derek\u2019s purview, so he forces himself to shift back, to give Derek some space.\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYour jeep was sitting there, probably right where you left it,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cWe figured we\u2019d be fast enough to get in and get it started before they tried anything, but...\u201d His eyes go distant, like he\u2019s remembering something terrible, and Stiles reaches out unthinkingly, sets the tips of his fingers against Derek\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere had to be at least ten of them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey came out of <i>nowhere</i>, all of them shifted, and Scott just - froze. Though I don\u2019t think we would have had time to get to the jeep anyway, they were that fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s looking determinedly up at the ceiling as he talks, and Stiles takes the opportunity to study his expression. He\u2019s pale, clearly exhausted and in a lot of pain, but his face is flooded with guilt, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey overpowered you?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cAnd took Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>The nod Derek offers his jerky and sharp.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself, okay?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIf anything, I mean - <i>I\u2019m</i> the one who gave him my keys - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t blame myself, then you can\u2019t either,\u201d Derek says immediately, his voice that same, rough growl. \u201cI\u2019m going to get him back though. Once the pack gets here - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and a bunch of recently-turned teenagers going up against ten or more Alphas?\u201d Stiles asks, and he doesn\u2019t <i>mean</i> to sound skeptical, but he is, and it comes through in his voice loud and clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s Peter,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Peter. We should definitely trust him. Absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s pack,\u201d Derek growls, his frown deepening. \u201cHe\u2019ll do as I ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grits his teeth and bites back the response he wants to make. It\u2019s hard work, ignoring the part of him that\u2019s still terrified of Peter, in a way he\u2019s never felt toward Derek.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not his call to make though. It\u2019s Derek\u2019s, it\u2019s his pack\u2019s, and if they all want Peter around, then Stiles guesses it\u2019s out of his hands.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get the chance to say anything else anyway; Isaac strides in a moment later, closely followed by Erica and Boyd.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeaton\u2019s around the corner,\u201d Isaac announces, as Erica and Boyd move immediately to Derek\u2019s side. \u201cWe passed him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Stiles says, getting quickly to his feet, vacating his own spot next to Derek for either Erica or Boyd to claim. Isaac looks just as panicked as Stiles feels, although he\u2019s keeping it just as tamped down, too. Stiles can see it anyway, in the tension surrounding his eyes, the tight line of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting him back,\u201d Stiles says, voice low and firm. \u201cNothing is going to happen to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac takes a deep breath, then gives Stiles\u2019 shoulder a clap before moving closer to Derek.</p>\n<p>The pack has to scatter away from their Alpha once Deaton finally walks in, but Stiles takes the opportunity to fill them in on the situation. Everyone\u2019s face looks the very picture of grim by the time he\u2019s finished.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to die,\u201d Erica mutters, earning her a sharp look from nearly everyone else in the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody\u2019s dying,\u201d Derek snaps, the words giving way to a snarl as Deaton applies some foul-smelling paste to his gasping chest wounds.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody\u2019s dying,\u201d Stiles repeats. \u201cJust... ignore the current state of your walking, talking werewolf shish-kebab over there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s in no shape to fight,\u201d Boyd chimes in, gaze flickering toward their Alpha. \u201cAnd we\u2019re down Scott. The three of us can\u2019t take on that kind of a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s Jackson,\u201d Stiles says, then blinks, looks around. \u201cWhere is he? For that matter, where\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson\u2019s on his way,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cBut Peter...\u201d He hesitates, then trails off, eyes sliding to Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much of Peter recently,\u201d Erica finishes.</p>\n<p>Stiles immediately rounds on Derek, ignoring the faint sympathy that wells up in him at the sight of how miserable he looks. \u201cPeter will fall into line, huh?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cAre you telling me that instead of keeping him on the tightest leash <i>ever</i>, your creepy zombie uncle has been completely left to his own sadistic devices?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek manages a glare, but it\u2019s not even close to threatening.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much you want to bet he has something to <i>do</i> with the Alpha Pack?\u201d Stiles says, voice rising. \u201cYou ever think about <i>that</i>, Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat hurts, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice comes out of nowhere, and Stiles whirls around, to find Peter Hale himself standing in the doorway to his living room, his ever-present smirk curving around his mouth. Stiles stumbles back, and it\u2019s only Isaac\u2019s hand gripped tight around his bicep that keeps him from falling. He can\u2019t help the fact that he still reads Peter as the biggest threat in the room - even when the room in question is filled to the brim with werewolves.</p>\n<p>Peter takes three precise steps, then stops. His hands are in his pockets, and his posture is relaxed and loose - as non-threatening as he can make it. His eyes are cold though, and his voice has that same lilt it had before, the one that had promised blood and mayhem and destruction.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all friends here, Stiles,\u201d Peter says. \u201cNo need for nasty accusations or name-calling. That isn\u2019t very <i>nice</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows, then lifts his chin a little higher, as defiant as he can possibly make it. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to help Scott, then fine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I swear to God, if you try anything - if this is all some elaborate douchebag scheme of yours - \u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes flash for just a moment - a dark rusty brown that\u2019s too close to red for Stiles\u2019 comfort. In the next instant it\u2019s gone, and Peter\u2019s eyes are back to their normal blue. \u201cI\u2019m here for my Alpha,\u201d he says, glancing at Derek, then back to Stiles. He takes his hands out of his pockets, offers them palm up to Stiles. \u201cNothing up my sleeves,\u201d he adds. \u201cI want Scott back just as much as you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not lying,\u201d Derek breaks in. He\u2019s breathing heavily and through his nose, jaw clenched tight as Deaton finishes bandaging him up. \u201cI\u2019d know it if he was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t feel all that convinced, but he nods anyway, knowing it\u2019s the best he\u2019ll get for now. Isaac gives his arm another friendly squeeze and then drops his hand; Stiles hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d been holding on all this time, and he manages a crooked smile for him. After all of this is over, once they get Scott back safe and sound, he\u2019s going to have to apologize to Isaac. He\u2019s not exactly looking forward to it, but he can at least recognize when he\u2019s in the wrong, and Isaac didn\u2019t actually deserve anything Stiles had thrown his way.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve done all that I can,\u201d Deaton says, fixing the last bandage in place, then snapping his gloves off and stepping away from Derek. \u201cYou\u2019ll heal, but it\u2019s going to take some time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek, of course, gets to his feet immediately; Stiles doesn\u2019t miss the way Deaton rolls his eyes - displeased, but resigned.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs soon as Jackon gets here, we\u2019ll leave,\u201d he announces, rolling his shoulders in a way that makes his muscles flex in a really distracting way, especially considering that now is so completely not the appropriate moment to be noticing something like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Stiles prompts, fixing his gaze determinedly to Derek\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe plan,\u201d Derek says, his eyes narrowing into a glare, \u201cis for you to stay here, safe, and let us take care of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Stiles a moment to realize that Derek is actually being serious, but the instant he does, he folds his arms across his chest and matches Derek\u2019s glare with one of his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst,\u201d he says, \u201cthat is a <i>shitty</i> plan. And it\u2019s not even really a plan, it\u2019s just another round of \u2018let\u2019s throw ourselves headfirst into danger and hope for the best,\u2019 which, <i>no</i>. And second? No way in hell am I sitting this out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Derek says firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt <i>worse</i>,\u201d Stiles fires right back.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I\u2019m not doing this with you right now. You\u2019re <i>staying</i> - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Stiles interrupts, fighting to keep from erupting into shouting. It\u2019s horribly tempting. \u201cWe <i>just</i> had this conversation, do you not remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Derek says. His gaze is so intense, it might as well be burning a hole right through Stiles. \u201cAnd I also remember the part where I said I wouldn\u2019t let anything <i>happen</i> to you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something about the way he says it makes Stiles flush, and he remembers all at once that they aren\u2019t alone; they\u2019re having this conversation in front of the rest of Derek\u2019s pack, in front of Deaton, in front of <i>Peter</i>. Stiles doesn\u2019t want to linger on exactly what\u2019s making that steady heat creep up his face, and so he just lifts his chin and drops his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cEither I\u2019m pack, or I\u2019m not, Derek,\u201d he says quietly. \"You don't get to go back and forth on this.\"</p>\n<p>Silence stretches between them, and neither of them breaks eye contact until they hear the sound of an expensive car roaring up the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson\u2019s here,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cI\u2019ll go... fill him in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Erica says immediately, and Boyd follows them out the front door. Deaton\u2019s disappeared; Stiles thinks he can hear him moving around the kitchen, maybe, leaving just him, Derek, and Peter in the living room.</p>\n<p>When Stiles glances back at Derek though, Derek\u2019s shifted his gaze to his uncle, and some sort of unspoken command must pass between them, because then Peter\u2019s melting out of the room as well, back to the front yard with the rest of the pack.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Stiles says, tongue sneaking out to wet his lips. His mouth feels very suddenly dry. \u201cIf this is your attempt to get rid of any and all witnesses, I\u2019m going to have to dock you points on subtlety.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, sounding every inch the grumpy sourwolf Stiles knows him to be. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He crosses to Stiles, finally coming to a stop directly in front of him, and Stiles\u2019 heart stutters wildly. For once, he does as Derek asks and keeps his mouth shut. Just for the moment. Just long enough for Derek to lean in, one hand curving around his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pack,\u201d Derek says, an affirmation. \u201cBut you\u2019re also human. You - you\u2019re <i>breakable</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cI\u2019ve been shot, clawed up, and gouged <i>way</i> fewer times than Scott has.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes darken toward something angry. \u201cThe difference,\u201d he growls, \u201cis that Scott gets back <i>up</i>. You might not be able to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just holds his gaze, letting his expression speak for him. He can tell that his message has been received, loud and clear, when Derek huffs a supremely irritated sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you take the bite?\u201d he asks suddenly, his grip tightening on Stiles\u2019 neck. He\u2019s not holding tight enough to hurt, but it\u2019s a firm, steady pressure, the tips of his fingers digging in. There\u2019s no prick of claws though, no danger that Stiles might come away scratched or nicked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, no hesitation this time around. His stomach swoops low though, that frisson of trepidation passing through him, the way it always does whenever he thinks about what his life might become if he were to ever say yes to that question.</p>\n<p>Derek just nods though, like he expected as much. He looks tired, and it makes Stiles want to do something insane, like hug him. He's clearly been spending too much time around Danny, or something. He curls his hands into fists to ensure they don't reach out for Derek, ignoring the sharp ache in his left wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do as I say,\u201d Derek says, before Stiles can say anything else. \u201c<i>Exactly</i> as I say, do you understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles agrees, then forces a grin to his face. It\u2019s more difficult than he expected it to be. \u201cAs long as what you say isn\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s expecting a growl, some sort of irritated eye roll, but Derek only looks at him steadily, then gives Stiles\u2019 neck a firm squeeze before finally releasing him. Stiles shivers when he moves away; Derek runs hot, and the air feels chilly without him directly in Stiles\u2019 personal bubble.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should check in with Deaton,\u201d Derek says, nodding toward the kitchen. \u201cSee if he can do anything about the bloodstains on your couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, <i>your</i> bloodstains,\u201d Stiles mutters, but it\u2019s a weak reply. He doesn\u2019t move from his spot as Derek heads outside. He just watches him go, until a polite cough from behind him catches his attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, I am not a maid service,\u201d Deaton says, \u201cbut I\u2019ll see what I can do about the blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says. He glances quickly to the couch and then just as quickly away, feeling faintly queasy at the sight of all the blood that Derek left behind. \u201cMy dad would, uh.. assume the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might not be wrong in that assumption,\u201d Deaton says, because Deaton is a glass half-empty kind of guy. \u201cA pack of Alphas isn\u2019t to be trifled with. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t already figured that out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve figured it out,\u201d Stiles protests. \u201cTrust me, I am incredibly aware. But they\u2019re not leaving me behind. They <i>need</i> me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton sighs and digs a small satchel out of his pocket. \u201cI never said they didn\u2019t, Stiles,\u201d he says placidly, then tosses him the bag. Stiles catches it one-handed; it\u2019s a soft, purple velvet, the color deep and rich, and it\u2019s tied with a silky, golden drawstring.</p>\n<p>\u201cMountain ash?\u201d Stiles asks, and Deaton nods. \u201cThis stuff doesn\u2019t come with, like, a handbook or something, does it? Because I\u2019ve gotta say, that would make this all ten thousand times easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo handbook,\u201d Deaton says. His mouth quirks to the side, giving his expression an almost fond edge. \u201cThere wouldn't be a point - it works differently for everyone. But I trust that you\u2019ll figure out what to do with it when the time comes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuper helpful, thanks,\u201d Stiles grumbles, but he slips the bag into the pocket of his jeans, where there\u2019s no danger of it falling out.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the sudden thump of footsteps coming toward the front door - loud enough that Stiles wonders if the stomping is for the benefit of his pathetic human hearing - and then Boyd pokes his head in, gaze finding Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s ready to go,\u201d he says, and Stiles squares his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes Derek actually have a plan yet?\u201d Stiles asks, but he\u2019s reaching for his hoodie, already heading toward the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we voted you get to ride with him,\u201d Boyd deadpans. \u201cSpend the car ride bouncing some ideas around, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Stiles grumbles, but he glances back before he goes, lifting a hand in Deaton\u2019s direction. \u201cHey... thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton just nods, his face serious. \u201cGood luck,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows and closes the door firmly behind them. He\u2019s pretty sure luck is exactly what they\u2019re going to need.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Derek grumbles as he pulls to a stop and cuts the engine. They\u2019re the first ones to the junkyard, but they also managed to hit every green light; the rest of the pack wasn\u2019t so lucky, but they should be along shortly. \u201cWe need something else, something different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Stiles says, not making any move to get out of the car just yet. \u201cYou said that there are usually treaties in place, right?\u201d Derek makes a vague noise, but Stiles is going to take it as agreement. \u201cAnd treaties require negotiation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to negotiate with us, Stiles,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles can hear the frustration in his voice, the tension lining those words.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ve been waiting for you to come to them,\u201d Stiles counters. Derek shoots him a look, which he pointedly ignores. \u201cYou did say that you and Laura had forfeited your right to hold territory here - and yes, there was other stuff going on, I get it, but maybe if you all just sat down and <i>talked</i> about it...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says firmly, shaking his head. \u201cIf they\u2019d wanted to play nice, they would have approached me. Instead, they intimidated the hell out of Boyd and Erica, spent weeks lurking on the outskirts of town while leaving menacing reminders of their presence everywhere, and then they <i>hurt</i> you. And now they\u2019ve taken Scott. They\u2019re <i>toying</i> with us, and it\u2019s - it\u2019s uncivilized. It\u2019s not the way packs are meant to interact with one another.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s the one with experience in this area, so Stiles has no doubt that he\u2019s technically <i>right</i>, but the fact remains that the Alpha pack has Scott, and they need to do <i>something</i> in order to get him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it anymore than you do, but what other choice do we have?\u201d Stiles says with a forced shrug. \u201cNow, how do traditional negotiations work? Pack to pack? Alpha to alpha?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt... varies,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIn a situation like this...\u201d He hesitates, and Stiles knows he isn\u2019t going to like whatever Derek has to say next.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll want to maintain an upperhand,\u201d Derek finally says, his mouth tightening at the corners. \u201cThey won\u2019t want to talk to me - I\u2019ll have to send a second. They\u2019ll probably want Peter, since he\u2019s more experienced than Boyd. As a show of trust, one of their pack members will stay with us, and in return... they\u2019ll choose a member of our pack to be sent to them for the duration of the negotiations.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not quite meeting Stiles\u2019 eyes as he says it, and a heavy, sour weight settles in the pit of Stiles\u2019 stomach. Just like that, he knows exactly who they\u2019ll choose.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds more like collateral,\u201d Stiles says, and Derek doesn\u2019t correct him, which... ugh, Stiles sometimes hates being right. \u201cThey, uh, also pretty heavily implied they\u2019d rip my head off if they saw me again,\u201d he says, swallowing. \u201cSure you can\u2019t send \u2018em Jackson instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you see why this is a terrible plan?\u201d Derek breaks in, his voice angry and sharp. \u201cOnce you\u2019re in there, I can\u2019t protect you, Stiles. Sending you is supposed to be a sign of good faith, of trust, but I <i>don\u2019t</i> trust them. They could do <i>anything</i> to you, and I wouldn\u2019t be in a position to stop them.\u201d</p>\n<p>His chest is heaving, and there\u2019s the slightest edge of red to his eyes, and Stiles doesn\u2019t want to think about what would happen if he ran into one of the Alphas right this moment. After a second\u2019s deliberation, he reaches out to Derek\u2019s shoulder, curling his fingers carefully against his jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is all we\u2019ve got,\u201d Stiles says seriously, his fingers tightening in what he hopes is a reassuring manner. He can feel how solid Derek is beneath that leather, his muscles coiled and ready for a fight. \u201cThey took Scott, and there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m letting them keep him. Besides,\u201d he adds, managing a crooked smile, \u201cnow that I think about it, Jackson would be unbelievably shitty at negotiations. You definitely don\u2019t want him going in there to plead your case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going in either,\u201d Derek says, his words almost a growl, his gaze so intent that Stiles has to freeze for a moment, caught under his stare.</p>\n<p>He finally swallows and takes his hand from Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe rest of the pack is probably here by now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should go meet them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods, slipping out of the Camaro, though Stiles takes an extra moment, just long enough to shoot a text to Alison, an oh-so-brief rundown of the situation, as well as a description of their location. The Argents aren\u2019t his first choice in allies, but as it so happens, he kind of hates this plan just as much as Derek does, and if the possibility for backup exists, well, he thinks they might as well try. He doesn\u2019t even know if it will work; to the best of his knowledge, Scott and Alison haven\u2019t been speaking at all this summer. He just has to hope that she\u2019ll come, that Scott being in danger will be enough to bring her here, along with her father and whatever other trustworthy hunters she can round up. </p>\n<p>As soon as the text is sent, Stiles gets out of the car, closing the door just as the rest of the pack turns into the junkyard: Jackson and Erica in his Porsche, Boyd, Isaac and Peter in the oh-so-sensible Honda Peter has apparently procured for himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, do we have a plan yet?\u201d Isaac asks, as soon as his feet are on the ground.</p>\n<p>Stiles shares a look with Derek; Derek looks away first.</p>\n<p>\u201cNegotiation,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try talking it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think <i>that\u2019s</i> a winning strategy?\u201d Jackson demands, lips pressed so tightly together that a tic starts up in his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a better plan than sending Danny on a snipe hunt for steroids,\u201d Stiles snaps back, and for once in his life, Jackson subsides.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well, negotiation, is it?\u201d a familiar voice breaks in, and a growl goes up amongst the werewolves as they all whirl around to face the newcomer. Stiles doesn\u2019t miss that the pack closes ranks around him, putting his all-too-human self squarely in the center of their protective circle. </p>\n<p>He recognizes the female Alpha from before, and she bares her teeth in a grotesque parody of a grin. She isn\u2019t alone; there\u2019s an adorably plump blonde who looks like she could be a cheerleader standing to her right, and a middle-aged man to her left, complete with slicked-back hair and a goddamn suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha Hale,\u201d the man says, his voice almost a purr. \u201cHow nice of you to drop by. Again. This makes, what, your pack\u2019s third visit today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s jaw is clenched tight. Stiles is just impressed his claws haven\u2019t made a showing yet. \u201cWe\u2019re here to negotiate,\u201d he grits out, looking positively murderous. Stiles hopes he keeps himself in check; murder doesn\u2019t seem like it would be a terribly positive start to what is supposed to be a productive discussion.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know the protocol?\u201d the blonde asks, lifting one perfectly plucked eyebrow. Her voice is light and pleasant, and her smile is positively perky, and Stiles really, really hates her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Derek says grudgingly. \u201cWhich of yours will you be sending to us?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man who looks like a car salesman steps forward, his expression easy and relaxed. \u201cThat would be me,\u201d he says, his gaze raking over Derek, then darting over to Isaac, whom he offers a wink. Stiles shudders on Isaac\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll speak with your uncle,\u201d the blonde says, and Peter steps forward readily, likely already expecting it. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll also - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe newest wolf and the human,\u201d the woman in the center interrupts. Derek goes rigid as a board beside him, and - yes, there are the claws.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says sharply. \u201c<i>One</i> of them will meet with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want both,\u201d the woman says simply, with the air of someone who knows she has all the cards. She smirks at Stiles, but then her gaze sweeps back to Jackson and settles into something more predatory.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s ready to argue - probably ready to launch himself at the Alphas, claws and fangs bared - so Stiles hastily steps on his foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he murmurs, when Derek looks at him, trying to keep his voice low enough so the Alphas can\u2019t hear, though he knows that\u2019s unlikely. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to throw you off, I bet, okay? It can\u2019t hurt to have an extra one of us in there, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t even believe his own attempts at reassurance, because there\u2019s something else at play here, he\u2019s sure of it, but the Alphas are a few too many steps ahead, and he doesn\u2019t see any choice but to go along with their whims and hope some opportunity falls into their laps.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t say anything else, but he also doesn\u2019t stop Stiles or Jackson as they step forward to stand beside Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d the female Alpha says, offering Derek another flash of teeth, one of the more threatening smiles Stiles has ever had the misfortune to witness. \u201cI\u2019ll send a messenger if we\u2019re going to be longer than an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>She gestures for the blonde to go first, then for Peter, Stiles and Jackson to follow, leaving herself to bring up the rear. The blonde sets a quick pace, and it gets darker the further into the forest they get, until Stiles is having difficulty placing his feet. He stumbles and nearly goes down more than once, but each time Jackson appears at his side, catching him. They don\u2019t discuss it, and Stiles doesn\u2019t bother to thank him, but he is grateful, in spite of the fact that it\u2019s Jackson who\u2019s keeping him on his feet.</p>\n<p>All told, the walk takes less than ten minutes, and they come to a stop in a clearing where an ancient barn stands, made of decrepit, decomposing wood. It\u2019s fairly large, but it also looks like it\u2019s on the verge of collapse.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Stiles mutters, \u201cwhat <i>is</i> it with werewolves and buildings that should have been condemned by now? Does squalor really do it for you or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson jabs him in the back, a gesture clearly intended to shut him up, but sarcasm is Stiles\u2019 coping mechanism when it comes to being scared out of his freaking mind, and this entire situation more than qualifies, so Jackson shouldn\u2019t expect a respite from the snark anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The blonde opens up a door tucked into the side of the barn, and Stiles is surprised to see a warm glow coming from within. They must have a generator, he realizes as he steps inside, because there are a half dozen lamps scattered throughout the half of the barn they\u2019ve clearly been using as their base. There are a few piles of moldy-smelling hay, which Stiles guesses have been used for bedding, probably, and across from him, barely visible in the gloom, is another door, a mirror to the one they\u2019ve just entered.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles whirls around, and his heart gives a lurch as he spots Scott, manacled to a corner. There are wires running along the metal, crackling with the electricity that\u2019s meant to keep Scott in check. Stiles starts toward him, but surprisingly, it\u2019s Peter who grabs him by the collar of his shirt and yanks him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to check on him,\u201d Stiles protests, \u201cmake sure he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t let go though; in fact, he curls his hand around Stiles\u2019 throat, and Stiles is shocked to feel the pinprick of five claws. He goes perfectly still, and Peter\u2019s other hand locks tight around his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Peter asks lightly, and from the way she looks up, Stiles knows he\u2019s talking to the female Alpha. \u201cCan we consider our bargain fulfilled?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBargain?\u201d Stiles chokes, just as Jackson starts growling and begins to shift. He isn\u2019t quick enough though; the female Alpha signals and two other werewolves grab him, pinning him easily to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Stiles demands unsteadily, remaining stock still, too aware of how Peter\u2019s claws are on the verge of sinking into his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy nephew killed me,\u201d Peter says silkily, walking Stiles over to where Scott is chained. \u201cYou don\u2019t <i>really</i> think I\u2019d just let that go, do you? Forgive and forget? Not exactly my style.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shoves Stiles down to the ground, and Stiles throws his hands out to catch himself, crying out when his cast thuds harshly against the dirt floor, sending a shockwave of pain all the way up his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what,\u201d Stiles says hoarsely, scrambling up to a sitting position, cradling his aching wrist to his chest. \u201cYou waited until a pack of Alphas showed up and made some kind of twisted deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s smirk. \u201cNow, that would have been rather chancey,\u201d he says. \u201cI called them here. It\u2019s a handful of old friends, some acquaintances, a few favors I was owed.\u201d Stiles gapes at him, and Peter\u2019s smirk widens. \u201cVery interested, they were,\u201d he says in a low voice, leaning in so Stiles will be able to hear, \u201cin our friend Jackson over there. And willing enough to help me regain my Alpha status in exchange for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>For all that Stiles has been anti-Peter from the start, it\u2019s still blowing his mind a little that Peter actually is the villain here, the proverbial Big Bad Wolf, if you will. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says shakily. \u201cSo, the Alphas - they wanted Jackson, you got them Jackson. And you\u2019re going to kill Derek to take his Alpha powers, I\u2019m guessing? And you had them take Scott because - because there\u2019s probably still some sort of tie between you, since you gave him the bite.\u201d Beside him, Scott is growling, low and menacing, deep in his throat. Stiles tries to put that from his mind, wets his lips as he stares Peter down. \u201cSo what\u2019m I doing here?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy have them bring me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to make the same mistakes as last time,\u201d Peter says easily. \u201cI plan to start my new pack off on the right foot.\u201d He catches Stiles by the chin, forces him to look up. \u201cNo refusing my very generous offer this time, Stiles,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d ever be a part of your pack?\u201d Stiles spits, while Scott makes yet another lunge forward, though he falls back with a cry when the manacles spark, shocking him. \u201cEven if you did bite me, you would <i>never</i> be my Alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smacks his cheek - two hard slaps that leave Stiles\u2019 skin stinging. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d he says as he stands up. He looks terribly pleased with himself. \u201cThe both of you - I think you\u2019ll fall into line quite nicely once I\u2019ve bestowed the rest of my bites. I think I\u2019ll start with the Sheriff, then work my way around to Allison and, of course, the lovely Melissa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott rears back and howls, and the only thing that keeps Stiles in place is the view he has of the wicked curve of Peter\u2019s claws, still unfurled at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, I thought so,\u201d Peter says with a low chuckle, and right before Stiles\u2019 eyes, he lets the change wash over him, doing the same twitchy shoulder thing that Stiles has seen Derek do. \u201cDo be good, boys, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lopes away to where the other Alphas are congregated, clearly ready to be on their way. Stiles takes quick stock of the situation. Jackson\u2019s manacled to the wall to their left, just like Scott, complete with the electrical hook up to keep him from breaking free. He\u2019s aware and alert though, staring straight at Stiles and Scott, something pleading in his expression. Stiles doesn\u2019t blame him; he can\u2019t imagine the Alphas have anything good in mind for their resident ex-kanima.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s one Alpha stationed equidistant between the three of them, who\u2019s clearly meant to be keeping an eye on everything while the other Alphas go fight. Stiles\u2019 gaze flicks back over to the group, and he can tell they\u2019re ready to go, that they\u2019ll be leaving any second. He\u2019s starting to panic, because Scott and Jackson are essentially out of commission right now, and there\u2019s no way Stiles can take out even one Alpha, not when he doesn\u2019t even have anything to <i>fight</i> with - </p>\n<p>He freezes, remembering the bag of mountain ash weighing down his pocket. He can\u2019t make a circle with it, there isn\u2019t time for that, and it\u2019s not like it would do them any good, anyway. And he certainly can\u2019t force any of the Alphas to ingest it. But maybe there\u2019s some other way he can use it, something else he can try.</p>\n<p>A possibility occurs to him all at once, and he carefully turns away from the Alphas, fishing the bag out of his pocket. He slips his hand inside the bag, collecting a fistful of ash, then catches Scott\u2019s eyes and sucks in a deep breath, making an exaggerated show of holding it. Scott looks at him in confusion for a moment, before understanding dawns and he takes his own breath, mimicking Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles catches Jackson\u2019s eyes and performs the same mime, making sure he sees Jackson take the breath before he closes his own eyes, breathes in deep and steady.</p>\n<p>He just has to believe. The mountain ash is all about belief, the knowledge that you can make something happen. He thinks about Gerard, what the mountain ash had done to him, thinks about the line that had snaked its way around the warehouse, the line that never should have connected because there wasn\u2019t enough ash to finish it.</p>\n<p>He thinks about the inside of this barn, imagines the dust in his palm swirling up into the air, spreading out in curling tendrils until the entire room is thick and choking with it. Then he brings his hand to his mouth and blows.</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks his eyes open immediately and has to resist the urge to gasp. The air is hazy with mountain ash, impossibly dense, considering he\u2019d had so little in his palm. He can barely see three feet in front of him, but he can hear the Alphas retching and gasping. Stiles doesn\u2019t have any time to waste though; he doesn\u2019t have any idea how long a werewolf can hold its breath, and he has a feeling exposing Scott and Jackson to any mountain ash whatsoever probably isn\u2019t <i>good</i> for them.</p>\n<p>He jumps to his feet and darts to Scott\u2019s side, yanking the wires away from the manacles. Scott\u2019s sweating, his skin gone almost grey, but as soon as the electricity is disconnected, he manages to yank himself free, and then he and Stiles are racing over to Jackson to repeat the process.</p>\n<p>An Alpha grabs Stiles\u2019 shoulder as he goes past, but he fumbles out another handful of mountain ash to fling in his face, and the man goes down with a yowl, clawing at his eyes.</p>\n<p>The three of them burst outside, out the door they entered, and Scott and Jackson immediately start sucking in huge lungfuls of air, terrible, hacking coughs wracking their frames. Stiles swats at them with his good hand as best he can, batting mountain ash from their hair and clothes.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he says nervously, glancing back to the barn. Already the dust is beginning to clear from the air, and Stiles has no idea if his plan will have proven to be nothing more than a minor inconvenience to the Alpha pack. \u201cWe have to go - we have to warn Derek - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Jackson chokes, giving his head a sharp shake. \u201cHe\u2019s already on his way - \u201d</p>\n<p>Derek and the rest of the pack come crashing through the trees before Jackson can finish his sentence. Derek\u2019s eyes are blazing red, Isaac, Erica and Boyd ranging behind them in their wolf forms, their own eyes glowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard Scott\u2019s howl,\u201d Derek growls. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>He starts forward, and Stiles lunges forward, grabs his arm to drag him back toward the tree line. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go in there right now, trust me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s mountain ash - I filled the air with it.\u201d His eyes narrow as he takes in the four wolves, remembering that there should be a fifth. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Alpha who was with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDead,\u201d Derek says, his expression dark and terrifying. \u201cCollateral. I told you, I heard Scott\u2019s howl, knew something was wrong. Where\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s with them,\u201d Jackson says, voice hoarse. He\u2019s looking decidedly rough, but there isn\u2019t any black oozing from either his or Scott\u2019s faces, so Stiles is going to consider that a win. \u201cHe made some sort of deal with them - they were going to help him kill you, so he could be an Alpha again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles watches Derek carefully, not entirely sure what he\u2019s expecting: a howl of rage, maybe, or a reckless rush to get at his uncle. Derek doesn\u2019t make a sound, though his body goes rigid, expression collapsing into a look of fury and betrayal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe end this here,\u201d he says, each word enunciated perfectly. \u201cThey\u2019ll be weak from the mountain ash - don\u2019t waste any time, attack as soon as they step foot outside. Don\u2019t kill them outright if you can avoid it - leave that to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s gaze finds Stiles, then, and his mouth tightens that much more. \u201cYou should go,\u201d he says, but he already sounds resigned, like he knows the answer he\u2019s going to get.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d Stiles says, lifting his chin in defiance.</p>\n<p>Before Derek can argue, the barn doors fly open, and everyone tenses, the wolves poising for attack. For a moment, there\u2019s no movement, and then there\u2019s suddenly an ear-splitting yowl, and the entire Alpha pack comes streaming out at once.</p>\n<p>Their faces are terrible, black liquid oozing from their mouths and noses, from their eyes, and there\u2019s a desperation to their movements that wasn\u2019t there before. The Alphas meet Derek\u2019s pack in a rush, and although Stiles\u2019 friends are outnumbered, they\u2019re fresh, unaffected by the mountain ash, and he can see that their attacks are stronger, more precise. More devastating.</p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s not just a pack of werewolves, it\u2019s a pack of <i>Alphas</i>, and they aren\u2019t going down without a fight.</p>\n<p>Stiles regretfully puts the mountain ash back into his pocket, knowing he won\u2019t be able to use it anymore, not when both packs are so entwined. He drops back toward the tree line, reaching for a fallen branch, since some sort of weapon is better than none.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a rustling behind him, and he whirls around with his branch at the ready, only to come face to face with Allison and her father. Stiles\u2019 mouth drops. </p>\n<p>\u201cGot your text,\u201d Allison murmurs, brushing past him to get closer to the action.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes some sort of shocked noise, but Allison signals for him to be silent, then raises her crossbow, clearly sighting one of the two Alphas who are advancing on Scott. She fires, and Stiles watches the arrow find its mark, embedding itself in the throat of the Alpha, who drops to the ground with a gurgle. The other Alpha - the blonde cheerleader-type - looks up just in time for Chris Argent to fire two bullets right into her heart: wolfsbane, if the way she shrieks is anything to go by.</p>\n<p>The gunshots, of course, take away their element of surprise, but Stiles isn\u2019t so sure if they even need that anymore. The Alpha pack is splintering before his eyes, three of them going down under the combined onslaught of Derek and Boyd, Erica taking care of a fourth. Scott gets to his feet with a roar, then leaps forward to join Jackson and Isaac, making quick work of the Alphas they\u2019re facing.</p>\n<p>Allison already has her bow reloaded, taking care to sight carefully before she looses another arrow. Chris barks out, \u201cStiles!\u201d and tosses him a gun, which Stiles just barely manages to catch with his good hand. He holds it carefully, the weight of it fitting comfortably in his hand. He\u2019s gone shooting with his dad before, and he\u2019s a decent enough marksman, even if he isn\u2019t the best.</p>\n<p>He takes another look around the battleground, and that\u2019s when he realizes, with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, that he doesn\u2019t see Peter anywhere.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s all about self-preservation, Stiles knows - clearly, since he had an entire backup plan at the ready to resurrect himself from the dead. So its not like it\u2019s surprising that Peter hasn\u2019t joined in the actual combat. He doesn\u2019t believe for a second that Peter has actually left though. He\u2019s no doubt lurking on the edges of the action, simply waiting to seize an opportunity, should one present itself.</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t afford that, can\u2019t afford to let Peter walk away from this unscathed, can\u2019t afford to let him live when he\u2019s only going to try to unravel them once more.</p>\n<p>Stiles double checks that the gun\u2019s safety is off, then darts between the fighting werewolves, back into the house. The mountain ash haze has mostly cleared out, but he doesn\u2019t linger, heading straight for the second door he\u2019d glimpsed earlier. He\u2019s unsurprised to find it open, and he slips out as quietly as he can, holding his gun at chest-level and doing his best to keep it steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d he calls hoarsely, keeping his back firmly to the barn. It\u2019s dark on this side of the clearing, infinitely more shadowed, and he\u2019s having a hard time adjusting to the gloom. \u201cPeter, you fucking <i>coward</i>. Come out where I can see you!\u201d</p>\n<p>He keeps his eyes glued to the forest, expecting at any moment to see Peter slinking out from between two trees.</p>\n<p>Instead, he hears a scrape from high above him, like the sound of a claw on wood, and he jerks around just in time to see Peter launch himself off of the roof, aiming straight for Stiles.</p>\n<p>He shoots once, misses, and then Peter\u2019s tackling him to the ground, the two of them rolling over twice before coming to a stop. Peter is sprawled on top of Stiles, one hand wrapped around his cast, pinning it over his head, but Stiles has the muzzle of his gun pressed right to Peter\u2019s stomach, his finger still on the trigger. Stiles is nearly gasping for air, and Peter\u2019s breathing isn\u2019t all that steady either.</p>\n<p>Peter still manages to crack an oily smile though, peering down at Stiles with something a lot like interest. \u201cWhy, Stiles,\u201d he says smoothly, \u201cis that a gun or are you just happy to see - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Stiles bites out, jabbing the gun harder into Peter\u2019s gut - his diaphragm, if the pained wheeze he makes is anything to go by. \u201cI swear to God, I will shoot you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I believe you,\u201d Peter murmurs. He moves his free hand to Stiles\u2019 neck, and Stiles feels the tips of his claws curving into his skin, far too close for comfort. \u201cThe real question,\u201d Peter continues, \u201cis whether that shot would kill me before I sliced open your throat.\u201d His smile widens, cold and ruthless. \u201cNow, since we seem to be at something of a stalemate here, how about I sheathe my claws, you put the gun down, and we both go our merry, separate ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Stiles manages to spit out. \u201cSo you can go after my dad or Mrs. McCall? Not a freaking chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s expression darkens, and his smile is starting to look distinctly forced, like he\u2019s finding their banter less amusing by the second. Stiles shifts uncomfortably and swallows hard. His heartbeat is through the roof, and if he can hear its thudding in his own ears, he can only imagine how loud it must be to Peter, betraying just how terrified he really is.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlanning on waiting here until my handsome nephew comes to rescue you, then?\u201d Peter asks sharply, and Stiles\u2019 chest tightens, a harsh breath spilling out of him. Peter\u2019s eyes gleam; he looks so self-satisfied that Stiles kind of wants to puke.</p>\n<p>\u201cA regular damsel-in-distress aren\u2019t we, Stiles?\u201d Peter asks, his voice cold. He forgets himself enough to lift his hand from Stiles\u2019 neck, pressing a claw into his cheek instead and drawing a ragged scratch down its curve. \u201cTake away your pretty bag of magic tricks, and what are you? <i>Useless</i>. You - \u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pulls the trigger, ignores the warm gush of blood and <i>shoves</i> Peter away, scrambling out from underneath him as fast as he can. Peter makes a wounded, gurgling noise, swaying on his knees. His face is ugly, and he shifts with a pained roar, struggling to his feet. Stiles is ready for it though, already on his feet, planting them shoulder-length apart as he levels the gun once more, this time straight at Peter\u2019s heart. \u201cOne more step,\u201d Stiles warns, voice thick, but his hand steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Stiles,\u201d Peter growls, almost fondly. \u201cYou would have made a wonderful, ruthless beta. I almost regret what I\u2019m about to do to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still faster than Stiles would have believed possible, seeing as he\u2019s got a wolfsbane bullet lodged underneath his ribs right now, but Stiles has put a fair amount of distance between them, and this time when he shoots, he doesn\u2019t miss.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s whole body jolts when the bullet hits him, and he looks almost surprised as he glances down at the sudden bloom of blood spreading darkly across his chest.</p>\n<p>When he crumples to the ground, he doesn\u2019t get back up again.</p>\n<p>Stiles turns at the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps, but it\u2019s only Derek and Scott who round the corner of the barn. Scott lets out a shout when he sees Stiles, racing over to him with a look of terror on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d he yells, \u201care you - oh God, what the hell happened - \u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glances down, letting out a soft \u201chuh\u201d at the sight of his blood-soaked shirt, the grisly sight of his red, slick hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not mine,\u201d he says weakly. His head feels heavy as he lifts it back up to Scott, who\u2019s come to a stop right in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, man, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m - \u201d He spots Derek, hovering a few steps behind Scott, and Stiles\u2019 voice cracks as he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m - I think he\u2019s dead. I\u2019m pretty sure I killed him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face is hollowed out, all sharp lines and gaunt shadows, but he squeezes Stiles\u2019 shoulder as he passes him, making his way carefully over to his uncle.</p>\n<p>Stiles watches him, a sick feeling rising up in his own stomach, a wave of nausea he has to force down. It\u2019s not like this is the first time he\u2019s caused irreparable damage to Peter Hale. He as good as killed him last time, too, with their homemade molotov cocktails, but that had been from a distance. This time - this time had been from Stiles\u2019 own two hands, and the evidence is still slick and sticky on his skin.</p>\n<p>He tries to wipe the blood off, but his shirt is too saturated to soak any of it up. Stiles finally drops his hands to his sides, ignoring the way they shake.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everyone - \u201d he starts to ask, \u201care the Alphas - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDead,\u201d Scott says, voice flat, his jaw clenched, tight and crooked. \u201cThey\u2019re all dead. Mr. Argent took care of the ones that Derek didn\u2019t get to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles spares a quick look toward Derek, who\u2019s bending over his uncle, examining him carefully. He\u2019s a mess, too, Stiles realizes, blood on his hands, his shirt and, horrifyingly, smeared over his chin and down his neck. Stiles shudders, and his stomach turns viciously. He doesn\u2019t want to get sick, that is the last thing he wants to do, and he swallows hard. Scott\u2019s looking at him with eyes that are wide and worried, and Stiles doesn\u2019t protest when he seems to make up his mind and drags Stiles in for a hug, because apparently hugs are a thing they do now, all the time. This makes, what, four times in one night?</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Stiles says thickly, fingers on his good hand curling into Scott\u2019s shirt. He\u2019ll have to buy him another one, because this one\u2019s going to be a lost cause after hugging Stiles. \u201cThat escalated so fucking quickly, Jesus, I can\u2019t - we should go home, I want to go home, my dad\u2019s going to <i>freak</i> if he gets home and I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Scott agrees, hugging him tighter. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you, okay? </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt?\u201d Derek asks, from just behind Stiles\u2019 shoulder, and Stiles jumps. He turns to face him, Scott\u2019s arms falling away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he manages. \u201cBruised, a little, but I\u2019m not - the blood isn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s gaze zeroes in on the scratch Peter had left on his cheek though, and he lifts his hand to Stiles\u2019 chin, angling his face to better examine it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scratch,\u201d Stiles says, voice cracking. His own gaze is kind of stuck on the blood streaked all over Derek\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something in Derek\u2019s expression that says, quite clearly, he isn\u2019t convinced, but then he seems to notice where Stiles is looking, and he hurriedly swipes his shirt sleeve across his face in an attempt to clean himself up a little. It doesn\u2019t help that much, though it does leave him looking very slightly less deranged.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Scott says gently, nudging Stiles back toward the front of the barn. Derek stays behind, already turning back to deal with his uncle.</p>\n<p>The front of the barn is a mess of bodies and blood, and the Stiles from a year ago probably would have been morbidly fascinated, but as it currently stands, he just keeps his chin lifted and does his best to ignore the grisly scene, instead seeking out his friends to make sure they\u2019re all right. Everyone seems to be in one piece, though more exhausted than elated. Going up against an Alpha pack head-on takes it out of you, clearly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Stiles says again, when he sees more than one pair of eyes widen, taking in his appearance. \u201cI\u2019m not hurt, Peter\u2019s dead, it\u2019s all - it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m driving Stiles home,\u201d Scott announces, leading Stiles toward the trees, in the direction of his Jeep. \u201cBut, um. I\u2019ll be back, okay? Twenty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles catches Scott\u2019s gaze straying to Allison and her father, and he almost has to laugh, because his best friend is nothing if not consistent. Scott\u2019s expression goes sheepish at Stiles\u2019 soft, huffed breath, but Stiles only shakes his head, nudges Scott with his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, dude,\u201d he says very quietly, \u201cI get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know why she\u2019s here,\u201d Scott says as they head into the woods, picking a careful path in the direction of the junkyard.</p>\n<p>\u201cI texted her,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cTold her you were in trouble. They must\u2019ve dropped everything to get here as fast as they did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s - that was - good call,\u201d Scott says roughly. He\u2019s never been good at keeping his emotions from his face, and even in the dark of the forest, Stiles can tell that he\u2019s flying through expression after expression, trying to get a handle on what this might mean for him and Allison.</p>\n<p>They stay quiet until they reach the junkyard, and Stiles breathes a sigh of relief when he spots his Jeep, unharmed and right where he left it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still got my keys?\u201d he asks, and Scott holds them up, gives them a shake. He unlocks the door for Stiles, then circles around to the driver\u2019s side, while Stiles settles into his seat, doing his best not to get too much blood on his baby's upholstery.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d Scott asks, as he turns the key and starts the engine.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, man,\u201d Stiles agrees. He sounds worn out, even to his own ears. \u201cThanks for driving me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever a problem,\u201d Scott says softly, seriously, and the Jeep rumbles quietly as they pull out of the lot and turn down the street, into the night.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t realize just how soaked in blood he is until he and Scott are a minute and a half down the road, and suddenly all he can smell is the copper tang of blood. His stomach turns, and he fumbles desperately for the window crank, rolling it all the way down and stopping just short of sticking his head out of it, the way a dog might on a long car ride.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Scott asks, shooting him a worried look.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles gasps, swallowing against the abrupt flood of saliva in his mouth. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m fine, just needed some air.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to pass out?\u201d Scott asks, voice pitching higher with concern. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to pass out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles forces himself to take a deep breath, letting the cool night air hit the back of his throat in a welcome rush. It makes him feel a little less like puking, but his heart is still hammering too fast. </p>\n<p>\u201cI - shit,\u201d he says, halfway to burying his face in his hands before he remembers the blood drying thick and tacky on his skin. He course corrects, leaning far enough forward to press his forehead to the dashboard instead, lets his fingers dig into his knees; his jeans are ruined anyway, a little more blood won\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHurting somebody up close, right? It\u2019s - I felt it when that bullet hit him, Scott, he <i>jerked</i> - and his blood\u2019s all <i>over</i> me, it\u2019s all - how\u2019m I even going to get it all out - \u201d</p>\n<p>A warm hand descends on the back of his neck, offering him a firm squeeze.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sucks,\u201d Scott finally says quietly, voice distant, like he\u2019s remembering. \u201cAnd it\u2019s different, yeah. It\u2019s more... real, when you can actually feel what you\u2019re doing to someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott takes a turn at a sharp angle, and the two of them rock to the left, Stiles\u2019 body pressing harder into Scott\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard him though,\u201d Scott says after another few blocks of strained silence. \u201cYou knew what he was going to do - to my mom, to your dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, yeah, he was the bad guy,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019d do it again, if I had to.\u201d</p>\n<p>And maybe that\u2019s the most unsettling part. That he\u2019s shaken now, kind of nauseous and freaked, but he isn\u2019t broken. He knows just what he\u2019s capable of, knows that if push comes to shove, he can stare down a threat to his family and pull the trigger anyway.</p>\n<p>They spend the rest of the drive in silence, Stiles breathing through his mouth in an effort to stave off that sick feeling still lurking in the back of his throat. It doesn\u2019t help much; he might not be able to smell the blood anymore, but he\u2019s so covered in it that he can still taste it, a metallic tang on his tongue.</p>\n<p>The Jeep bounces gently as Scott turns into Stiles\u2019 driveway, and as soon as it\u2019s come to a rocking stop, Stiles fumbles the door open and nearly trips over himself to get outside, to get away from that enclosed space.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, already holding his hand out for his keys. \u201cFor driving me, thanks. You should get back - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m staying,\u201d Scott says easily, circling around to Stiles\u2019 side, depositing the keys in his palm. His face is set, and Stiles wonders when he changed his mind. \u201cNo way I\u2019m leaving you here alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Stiles protests immediately. He winces though, registering all too well just how unconvincing he sounds. \u201cAnd you told Allison - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk some other time,\u201d Scott says firmly. He\u2019s already got his arm draped over Stiles\u2019 shoulders, totally unmindful of the blood. \u201cThis is where I should be right now, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles slumps, a breath away from agreement, when his front door bursts open and Danny comes rushing out, pulling up short when he gets close enough to see their current state in the evening\u2019s gloom.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he breathes, voice gone soft with something that sounds, to Stiles\u2019 mere human senses, like terror. \u201cHoly <i>shit</i>, Stiles - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Stiles croaks. \u201cI\u2019m not - it isn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t even think to question what Danny\u2019s doing here. Somehow, just seeing him sends a dizzying rush through him, a feeling he doesn\u2019t have a name for. It relaxes him though, the tension within him uncoiling sharply enough that he feels the way Scott notices, how his arm twitches, how he turns to look at Stiles, surprise in his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Danny manages, nodding weakly. \u201cScott, are you - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso fine,\u201d Scott says. \u201cNo one\u2019s hurt, and the Alphas are dead, so. We won, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVictory to us,\u201d Stiles chimes in weakly, but no one laughs. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to get inside,\u201d Danny says suddenly. \u201cBefore your neighbors see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, then turns to Scott. \u201cThanks for driving me,\u201d he says, quiet, low enough that Danny\u2019s human hearing won\u2019t pick up on it. \u201cYou should go talk to Allison.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny\u2019ll stay,\u201d Stiles says, glancing over his way, just for a second. Danny\u2019s tense, worry still lining his expression, but his gaze is fixed to Stiles, like he\u2019s resisting the urge to check him over for himself, make sure he\u2019s really okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, dude,\u201d Scott sighs, then drags him into a hug. Stiles is going to let it slide for tonight, but as of tomorrow, he\u2019s putting a daily limit on hugs. \u201cI\u2019m calling you in an hour, okay? And if you need me to come back over, just say the word.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Stiles promises. \u201cThanks, I - thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d Scott says steadily, pulling away far enough to look at Stiles with such fierce affection that Stiles can\u2019t believe he went half a summer without speaking to Scott at all. \u201cYou\u2019re a big damn hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>It actually shocks a laugh out of Stiles, and Scott beams, clearly pleased by it. He doesn\u2019t linger beyond that - probably wants to keep things on a light, pleasant note - and Stiles watches him shift as he darts between Stiles\u2019 and his neighbor\u2019s houses, taking a route back to the junkyard that will keep him out of the way of any prying eyes.</p>\n<p>When Stiles turns back around, Danny\u2019s watching him, eyes dark and filled with concern. \u201cShower?\u201d he asks, and at the suggestion, Stiles feels a surge of want more powerful than anything he\u2019s ever known.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cOh my God, yes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He follows Danny into his house, noting with approval that there\u2019s no evidence of blood; Deaton must have some kind of magic clean-up fairy dust that he hasn\u2019t told Stiles about, because Stiles doesn\u2019t have any idea how he managed to get the place so spotless.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Deaton let me in,\u201d Danny says, as he leads Stiles up the stairs, moving familiarly enough that Stiles wonders if he\u2019s wiled away his time here by exploring the place. \u201cI wanted to come by, see if you were really okay, and I found him instead. He told me what was going on, and I just... Jesus,\u201d he says, gives his head a shake. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you guys deal with this shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDealing with it implies some degree of control,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI think you\u2019re giving us too much credit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny glances over his shoulder, eyes finding Stiles. \u201cYou seem pretty in control to me,\u201d he says, which is ridiculous, considering that just ten minutes ago Stiles had been on the verge of a panic attack. The way he\u2019s looking at Stiles is careful and warm, and Stiles chokes on a response, feels a rush of blood start to creep up his face.</p>\n<p>Danny notices it, gaze lingering over Stiles\u2019 cheeks before he abruptly turns around as they reach the landing, ducking swiftly into the bathroom. Stiles takes a moment to grip the railing and breathe deeply, needing the time to regain his composure. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him, that he can still get distracted by Danny\u2019s eyes and his broad, strong shoulders, even after the night he\u2019s had.</p>\n<p>He hears the shower turn on, and he forces himself to move. Danny must have the shower cranked all the way to boiling, because it\u2019s only been a few seconds, but Stiles already feels a burst of steam against his face as he enters. It feels good - soothing, like stepping into a sauna, the kind of warm air that digs into your muscles and forces them to relax.</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s rummaging through the cabinets, making a triumphant noise as he pulls out a plastic bag, a remnant of Stiles\u2019 last trip to CVS.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor your cast,\u201d he says, nodding to Stiles\u2019 wrist. Thank God for Danny, Stiles thinks, because in his current state of mind, he\u2019s pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t have remembered to wrap his cast until it was halfway to disintegrated.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet undressed - we\u2019ll wrap it once you\u2019re ready to get in,\u201d Danny says brusquely, but unless Stiles is much mistaken, he\u2019s blushing a little. </p>\n<p>It could be the heat, Stiles thinks. It\u2019s probably just the heat.</p>\n<p>He turns away from Danny as he peels his shirt off, tossing it right into the trash can. He toes off his shoes, then undoes his pants and shoves those down, pulls his socks off as he steps out of his jeans. It leaves him in just his boxers, and he hesitates for a moment before deciding to leave those on.</p>\n<p>Stiles catches Danny watching when he turns around, but his eyes are mostly fixed to the blood that soaked through Stiles\u2019 shirt and smeared across his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Danny whispers again, but he doesn\u2019t say anything else as he carefully takes Stiles\u2019 cast in his hand and begins to tie the bag around it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWaterproof, you think?\u201d he asks after a minute, eyebrows raised, and Stiles nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould be good,\u201d he says, \u201cthanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mirror in the bathroom is already fogged over, and it\u2019s starting to get difficult to breathe, the air full of muggy moisture. Stiles tests the shower with his unbagged hand, then turns the knob just a titch back toward cold, not wanting to scald himself when he gets in. Once the stream of water is bearable, he steps into the tub, tugs the curtain shut behind him.</p>\n<p>The hot water feels incredible, streaming over his aching body, already pinkening by the time it pools around his feet. Stiles is going to have to scrub to get the blood off, but for now he just bows his head and lets the water sluice over him, turns his thoughts off and empties his mind of anything but how good a hot shower feels.</p>\n<p>His concentration breaks when the curtain slides open again, and Danny steps in, undressed but for his boxer briefs. Stiles swallows, mouth parting at the sight of him, and Danny offers him a crooked smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just thought you could use some help, maybe,\u201d he says quietly, a little hard to hear over the drumming of the water against porcelain. Stiles doesn\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever looked at him quite like Danny is right now - as if Stiles is someone special, someone Danny wants to get to <i>know</i>, dig down deep and find out all his secrets.</p>\n<p>The thought makes Stiles shiver, even though the shower is far too hot for that.</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna scrub my back for me?\u201d he finally croaks, a pale imitation of a joke, and Danny steps closer, reaching past him for the shampoo.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d he says lightly, and Stiles knows right then that he can choose to take that statement however he pleases.</p>\n<p>He stays silent for now, turns cooperatively as Danny lathers up the shampoo, then starts massaging it into his hair. Stiles has been growing it out for the past couple months, so it\u2019s longer than it used to be, and he can\u2019t quite contain a quiet moan as Danny\u2019s fingers slide through it, rubbing firmly against his scalp.</p>\n<p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Danny murmurs, and Stiles slips them shut as Danny guides his head back under the water, though he wicks away most of the soap before it can get near Stiles\u2019 eyes.</p>\n<p>Once his hair is thoroughly rinsed, Danny gets the soap out and starts sudsing up Stiles\u2019 back. His touch hovers somewhere between clinical and an outright massage, and Stiles can feel his dick starting to harden, firming up against the sopping cloth of his boxers.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn,\u201d Danny says, once Stiles\u2019 back is perfectly clean. Stiles hesitates for only a moment this time, grateful for the fact that he\u2019s already flushed from the heat of the shower, that Danny won\u2019t be able to tell he\u2019s blushing. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can finish - if you want,\u201d Stiles forces himself to say, voice hoarse, just to check in. He doesn\u2019t want Danny to feel like he owes Stiles this, or like Stiles isn\u2019t capable of finishing washing up, even if he will have to do it one-handed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got this,\u201d Danny says. His eyes are very dark, and Stiles exhales in a stuttered rush as Danny brings his soapy hands to Stiles\u2019 body and begins rubbing them in circles along his skin, starting at his shoulders and making his way to Stiles\u2019 chest, slowly and carefully down his stomach.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 voice cracks when he says, \u201cFuck, Danny,\u201d when Danny\u2019s hands reach his waistband. One stays right where it is, fingertips hovering over the saturated fabric, but the other one slides around Stiles\u2019 side to splay against the small of his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like me,\u201d Stiles blurts out, all of a sudden feeling vaguely panicked and entirely out of his depth, because this is, unquestionably, the most intimate thing that\u2019s ever happened to him, and on top of everything else that's happened tonight, it might be too much for him to deal with.</p>\n<p>Danny just looks at him steadily though, his gaze warm and almost fond. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been true for awhile now,\u201d he murmurs, and it could be condescending or rude, but Stiles already knows that Danny spent a long time disliking him, and to hear this straight from his mouth, that it\u2019s just not true anymore...</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some serious hidden depths, Stilinski,\u201d Danny adds, and Stiles means to offer him a smile, something in return for what he\u2019s sure is a compliment, but he gets distracted by Danny\u2019s mouth instead, his breath hitching obviously.</p>\n<p>Danny inhales, sharp and sudden, then gently nudges Stiles back against the shower wall. The cold shock of the tile makes Stiles gasp, just as Danny leans in for a kiss.</p>\n<p>Danny, Stiles realizes suddenly, is tall. Stiles might run with werewolves, but Danny\u2019s got inches on everyone in the pack, except for maybe Boyd and Isaac. It means Stiles has to tilt his head up to kiss him, that he has to reach up to thread his fingers through Danny\u2019s hair, the better to tug him in closer.</p>\n<p>Danny\u2019s mouth is wet and hot, and he\u2019s terribly, brain-meltingly practiced at this, teasing Stiles\u2019 mouth open with ease, sucking hard on his bottom lip, only to soothe it a moment later with a flick of his tongue.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know what to do with his injured hand, can\u2019t seem to find a comfortable position for it, and Danny finally wraps his fingers just below his cast, around the skin of Stiles\u2019 forearm, and presses it into the wall behind him, up above Stiles\u2019 head. It makes Stiles wonder if Danny was paying attention at the club, if he was taking mental notes of the things Stiles likes.</p>\n<p>Just the thought makes Stiles\u2019 dick throb, makes him jerk his hips against Danny\u2019s, moaning when he can feel how hard Danny is, too. He repeats the motion, and this time it\u2019s Danny who makes a noise, low and choked in the back of his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to blow you?\u201d Danny offers, and Stiles\u2019 eyes fly open - God, he hadn\u2019t even realized they\u2019d fallen shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, no,\u201d he gasps. \u201cIf you put your mouth on me, I\u2019m going to slip and crack my head open and die the least heroic death ever.\u201d Danny snorts, but he doesn\u2019t protest, probably sensing the truth of the statement.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s just... this is good, right?\u201d Stiles asks unsteadily. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice?\u201d Danny asks with a teasing smile, even as he rocks forward again. \u201cIs that all I rate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right on the verge of excellent,\u201d Stiles says, the fingers of his uninjured hand tugging thoughtlessly at Danny\u2019s hair. \u201cMaybe if you took those briefs off - \u201d</p>\n<p>Danny doesn\u2019t hesitate; he lets go of Stiles just long enough to shove his underwear down, the fabric clinging as he slides it off. Then his hands go to Stiles\u2019 waistband, and Stiles nods frantically at Danny\u2019s questioning look, lifting his hips away from the wall so Danny can peel his boxers off.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time Stiles has ever been naked with anyone outside of a locker room, and he\u2019s determined not to stare like someone who\u2019s obviously new at this. He drags Danny in for another kiss instead, but this time his dick drags wetly up Danny\u2019s hip, and it's starting to feel like Stiles\u2019 brain is going to short-circuit from how <i>good</i> this is.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got you,\u201d Danny says, one hand sliding up Stiles\u2019 back again, the other - oh God, wrapping around both of their dicks, giving Stiles\u2019 a warm, tight channel to fuck up into.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s over embarrassingly fast after that. They thrust up against each other, bodies wet and overheated; Stiles clutches at Danny\u2019s shoulder as he comes, muffling his cries into his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Danny grunts, then, \u201cStiles - \u201d and his hips jerk hard, come splashing onto his fist, some even splattering against Stiles\u2019 stomach.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels limp and wrung out, exhausted down to his bones, and all he manages to do is pant and try to catch his breath as Danny maneuvers him back under the water, carefully rinsing both of them off. The water\u2019s just starting to go lukewarm, but it\u2019s a cool relief against Stiles\u2019 overheated skin.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re all cleaned up, Danny turns the water off, and the two of them stumble out of the tub, dripping all over the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cTowels\u2019re - that cabinet, there,\u201d Stiles manages, pointing at the cabinet in question. Danny obediently snags two fluffy towels, handing one off two Stiles and using the other to dry himself off, before tying it snugly around his waist. Stiles copies his movements, albeit quite a bit clumsier, with only one working hand. When he fumbles his effort to tie the towel at his waist, Danny steps in, wrapping Stiles up easily and efficiently although he takes advantage of the opportunity to tug Stiles in close enough for another slow, drawn out kiss.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 knees feel weak once they finally part, and he dips his head, pressing his mouth to Danny\u2019s collarbone, since it\u2019s right there in front of him, tempting him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBed,\u201d he murmurs, because between the night\u2019s earlier violence, the sex, and the way Danny\u2019s kisses have left him breathless and dazed, Stiles doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll manage to stay on his feet too much longer.</p>\n<p>They do pause briefly in Stiles\u2019 bedroom to drag on some shorts before letting the towels drop and crawling into Stiles\u2019 bed. Like last time, Danny immediately curls into Stiles, his arm wrapped firmly at his waist, nose tucked into the back of his neck. Stiles feels a vague, interested pull low in his stomach, but the adrenaline rush is finally wearing off, the crash settling in, and it\u2019s left him more exhausted than horny.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice, lying there with Danny, with the warm, solid weight of him, and Stiles wishes he could just let it be, that he could turn his brain off for once and enjoy it.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not how Stiles\u2019 brain operates, unfortunately, and after a few quiet minutes, he says, \u201cYou know this is a bad idea, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny doesn\u2019t say anything; Stiles can feel his soft, even breathing against the back of his neck, the only sound against the silence of the room. When it\u2019s been too much stillness for too long, Stiles shifts, lets the pads of his fingers tap idly along Danny\u2019s forearm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just,\u201d he starts to say, soft and stilted, \u201cyou don\u2019t want any part of this. You said you didn\u2019t, and that\u2019s - it\u2019s for the best, really, congratulations on the whole having a sense of self-preservation thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny makes a muffled noise - Stiles can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s amusement or a mild scolding - and tightens his arm, pulling Stiles closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in this though,\u201d Stiles says, staring straight ahead at his window, where the mountain ash line is still intact. He\u2019ll have to remove it tomorrow morning; the Alphas are gone, after all, and he isn\u2019t interested in keeping any of the werewolves - his pack, he supposes - out of his room anymore. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m always going to be. And I don\u2019t want to be the person dragging <i>you</i> in and getting you involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got Jackson for that,\u201d Danny says lightly, and Stiles can\u2019t help but crack a wry smile, bumping Danny\u2019s shin with the heel of his foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t - you\u2019ve got Caroline and Parker - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Danny says. His voice is very quiet. \u201cI know, I do. I just wanted to... I just wanted. Even if it was only this once. Is that okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, and the thing is, he really does feel okay about it. A little achy, maybe, deep down, to have done this with Danny once and know they\u2019re not going to be doing it again, but overall, it\u2019s okay. They can still be friends, Stiles thinks, because that\u2019s something else entirely. It\u2019s not this closeness, not this warm, heavy contentment, bodies pressed close together and intertwined; friendship doesn\u2019t have to entangle the way a relationship would. It can, of course, if you let it, but it doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Danny says, and to Stiles\u2019 surprise, he can hear a smile in his voice. \u201cI can\u2019t compete with the fact that Derek Hale really wants to put his dick in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh - <i>dude</i>!\u201d Stiles splutters, his entire body lighting up with a hot, brutal blush. Danny\u2019s chuckling behind him, that <i>asshole</i>, and when Stiles tries to wiggle away, Danny just holds him even tighter, not letting him gain an inch.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Danny says, still laughing. \u201cGeez, calm down, we\u2019ll talk about that later. You\u2019re all mine tonight, anyway, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles resists answering for as long as he can, but he caves when Danny starts to skim kisses along the nape of his neck and up underneath his ear. \u201cFine, yeah,\u201d he says, letting himself settle back comfortably against Danny\u2019s chest. \u201cFor tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>He falls asleep almost as soon as he lets himself relax, Danny\u2019s breath soft and steady against his skin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 mouth falls open, some half-assed explanation ready to spill out, but his dad gives a firm shake of his head, points to Stiles, then downstairs, and holds up five fingers. He doesn\u2019t wait for a response, and Stiles winces as he listens to the heavy tread of his dad\u2019s footsteps, all the way down the steps.</p>\n<p>Danny is still asleep, chest rising slowly with each deep breath, and Stiles doesn\u2019t have any interest in bringing him along to the conversation that\u2019s about to happen, so he carefully disentangles himself from Danny\u2019s sprawling limbs, then slips as quietly as he can out of bed. He pulls on the first t-shirt he sees, one that he\u2019d left hanging off the back of his computer chair, and creeps downstairs.</p>\n<p>His dad\u2019s already sitting at the kitchen table, a glass of water and two pills in front of the empty chair clearly meant for Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake those,\u201d his dad says, nodding toward the pills, \u201cand then you and I are finally going to have that chat we\u2019ve been putting off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t even try to argue; he just slips into the chair, knocks the pills back and takes a long, slow pull of water before finally setting his glass down.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m bisexual,\u201d he says, not quite managing to meet his dad\u2019s eyes. It isn\u2019t his fault the grain of their kitchen table spirals out in a really interesting pattern.</p>\n<p>He does startle a bit, head jerking up, when he feels his dad\u2019s hand settle heavily on his shoulder. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d his dad says seriously, gaze completely focused on Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d He punctuates the question with a gentle squeeze, a small shake of Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cI love you no matter what, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. His voice, shockingly, is hoarse, and he forces a swallow, clears his throat. He can\u2019t quite believe how much lighter his shoulders feel, how much less constricted his chest is, just hearing those words out loud. It\u2019s not like he hadn\u2019t <i>known</i> his dad would be all right with it, but... it\u2019s good to actually hear it. To know for certain. \u201cYeah, I do. Love you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d his dad says, and then his gaze sharpens. \u201cNow let\u2019s talk about how I found two sets of clothes in the bathroom last night and Danny Mahealani in your bed this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles spends a brief moment panicking about the shirt he\u2019d so carelessly thrown into the trash can last night, but after a second, he convinces himself that his dad would have led with that before anything else. Hell, if his dad had found that shirt, he\u2019d have charged into Stiles\u2019 bedroom when he got home last night, demanding an explanation. As it stands, he probably peeked into the bathroom, made a pissy face, then left the mess for Stiles to clean up.</p>\n<p>His dad\u2019s staring at him expectantly, eyebrows just shy of forming an actual frown, and Stiles wets his lips, squares his shoulders. \u201cHe came over last night to check on me,\u201d he says, figuring it\u2019ll be simplest to stick as close to the truth as possible. \u201cTo just - you know. See if I was okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends. Last night was sort of - he - look, neither of us really needs a detailed explanation, right?\u201d Stiles asks, a bare note of desperation creeping into his voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear that, I don\u2019t want to say it, so let\u2019s just leave it at, we weren\u2019t doing anything stupid. Can\u2019t we just do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can feel that his face is blotchy and pink by the time he\u2019s finished, though his dad is looking awfully red as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m buying you condoms,\u201d his dad says a moment later, and Stiles manfully resists the urge to cover his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Dad</i>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am buying you condoms, and I am not saying that I want you to have to use them, or that I <i>condone</i> you doing anything that requires them, but I\u2019d like for you to have them if you need them,\u201d his dad says, and yep, he might be even redder than Stiles is. \u201cBut I don\u2019t actually want you to need them, you\u2019re still a kid,\u201d he finishes, pointing a stern finger at Stiles. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God, kill me now,\u201d Stiles groans, burying his face in his elbow. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, I understand!\u201d Stiles exclaims, lifting his head back up. \u201cNo more of this talk, never - <i>please</i>. I\u2019ll make you bacon for breakfast if you promise we don\u2019t ever have to speak of this again.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad looks hilariously torn between the promise of bacon and the desire to be a good parent. \u201cSo long as you\u2019re smart,\u201d he finally says. \u201cAnd safe. All right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks about how, in the big scheme of things, last night with Danny was downright innocent, and then he thinks about all the other things he\u2019s doing, the things that aren\u2019t safe at all, and the guilt hits him hard and fast. \u201cI - yeah,\u201d he agrees, forcing the spike of shame away. That\u2019s to deal with later, something he\u2019ll get to eventually, but it doesn\u2019t belong here, not in this moment. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be smart. And safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long stretch where his dad just looks at him, like he\u2019s weighing the sincerity of Stiles\u2019 promise, but he finally sighs, apparently satisfied, and reaches out to run a hand through Stiles\u2019 hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the bacon, I\u2019m not making you cook with a broken wrist,\u201d he says as he stands up. His voice is gruff, but fond, a warmth underneath his words. \u201cHow\u2019s the injury today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>It makes him smile, a little bit crookedly, because that, at least, is the truth. He doesn\u2019t have everything figured out yet, not by a longshot, but he\u2019s doing okay, and okay feels pretty good.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d his dad says, and when Stiles gets to his feet, his dad drags him into a tight hug, presses a kiss to Stiles\u2019 temple. Stiles allows it, sinks happily into his dad\u2019s embrace, strong and sure and comforting.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo tell Mahealani to get his ass down here if he wants breakfast,\u201d his dad says as he finally lets Stiles go. Stiles grins at him, flush with a mixture of embarrassment and contentment. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd kindly remind him that I am the Sheriff and if I stumble across another unauthorized sleepover, I\u2019ll arrest him for breaking and entering,\u201d he calls after Stiles, who\u2019s already loping up the stairs. It surprises a laugh out of Stiles, short and bright, and when he makes it back to his room, Danny\u2019s already sitting up in bed, tangled in Stiles' sheets, looking confused and a little bit wary.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d he asks, rubbing at his eyes, and Stiles' smile widens.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Stiles says, feeling better - lighter - than he has in a long, long time. \u201cBreakfast.\u201d</p>"
