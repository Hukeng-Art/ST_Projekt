  "text": "<p>\u00a0 Min Yoongi is not having a good day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 For one thing, he\u2019s just been turned into a fucking cat by a bitter sorceress.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The sorceress in question is standing over him, hands on her hips and looking awfully pleased with herself. She\u2019s a pretty young thing with long dark hair and big brown eyes. The exact opposite of Yoongi\u2019s type.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019d told her as much when she\u2019d come onto him in the coffee shop where Yoongi was waiting grumpily for his morning caffeine fix. He\u2019d promptly rebuffed her advances, so not in the mood to deal with this shit so early in the day. She\u2019d been visibly offended, stalking back to her table while muttering something under her breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0With his steaming hot coffee in hand, Yoongi had exited the shop and cut through the alley next door, a shortcut back to his apartment. Unbeknownst to him, the young woman had followed him into the abandoned alley.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em> \u201cAllerio ma shaek ackni anni,\u201d</em> a feminine voice calls out behind him, the words oddly warped and echoey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The next thing he knows, there\u2019s a puff of pink smoke and Yoongi is staring up at the woman, who is suddenly the size of a freaking giant. His coffee drops to the ground and explodes all over the pavement, and he jumps to avoid the hot spray.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Except he doesn\u2019t jump back on two human legs. No, he jumps back on four little legs. Cat legs. Yoongi stares down at himself, sees a fluffy chest and soft little paws. Looks behind him and sees a long, bushy, bottlebrush tail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Not only is he a cat. He\u2019s a blue cat. Fucking royal blue, just like how he'd dyed his hair last week. Apparently the young woman has a sense of humor. He stares up at her balefully, not even believing this shit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</em> He asks, but it comes out as a series of raspy meows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She still seems to be able to understand him though, and she grins nastily down at him. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach you to be so disrespectful,\u201d she crows, reaching down to pet his head patronizingly. Yoongi swipes a clawed paw at her, his hackles raising. It\u2019s a strange sensation. She pulls back, laughing meanly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking witch, I take it?\u201d</em> Yoongi meows, glaring at her. He wonders what color his new cat eyes are.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She tuts and wags at finger at him. \u201cA sorceress, honey bear. Much more powerful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi flicks his fluffy tail irritably. It feels so weird. \u201c<em>A sorceress. Of fucking course. They can never take rejection well, the psycho bitches.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 The sorceress narrows her eyes dangerously at him. \u201cWatch yourself, fur ball. I could turn you into a pile of dust with a snap of my fingers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s ears involuntary flatten against his head. <em>\u201cDo it then, you bitter bitch.\u201d</em> Yoongi really needs to learn when to shut up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The sorceress\u2019 lips tighten, and for a second, Yoongi thinks she actually will. Then she shakes herself off and smiles cruelly down at him. \u201cNah. I think this\u2019ll be more fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She takes a step back and panic flares in Yoongi's chest. <em>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 She glances down at her watch. \u201cI have Pilates in fifteen minutes. See ya around!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cWait!\u201d</em> Yoongi cries, though it just comes out as a loud yowl.<em> \u201cOkay, okay, you've had your fun. Turn me back now.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 She just laughs humorlessly and shakes her head. \u201cMmmm, don't feel like it. Have fun, fur ball.\u201d Then she snaps her fingers and disappears in a cloud of pink smoke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 All that remains in the empty alley is a stinky dumpster, a spilled coffee, and a royal blue cat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Well, shit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br> \u00a0\u00a0 For three days Yoongi roams around the city, starving and miserable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He has to dig through dumpsters and trash cans to try to find scraps of food to eat, which results in his blue fur stinking to the high heavens. He\u2019s cold and tired and just wants to go to sleep, but nowhere is safe on the streets. Just yesterday he\u2019d almost become a dog\u2019s dinner when he\u2019d strayed too far into a neighborhood in search of something to eat. He\u2019d narrowly avoided its snapping jaws before racing back the way he\u2019d came, ears flat against his head and tail fluffed up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His soft pink paw pads are cracked from the constant contact with the rough pavement and concrete. He\u2019s taken to sleeping on a slab of damp, moldy cardboard under a dumpster at night, shivering and trying not to inhale to stench around him too deeply. He keeps his distance from people, not sure how they\u2019d react to seeing a blueberry colored cat on the street, and not wanting to find out. Yoongi prays to god that he doesn\u2019t have fleas. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever be able to live that down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019s been keeping his eye out for the sorceress, hoping that if he sees her again he\u2019d be able to convince her to turn him back, but no such luck. So Yoongi has taken to camping outside a popular occult shop at the end of a busy street. There\u2019s a skinny alley way directly across the street from the shop, and Yoongi sits behind a dented trash can to watch to front door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His hope is that he\u2019ll see someone who will be able to help him with his situation. Although the shop has its fair share of regular humans who just like to check it out, it\u2019s also a popular stop for actual magic users. Yoongi hopes that he\u2019ll be able to find someone who\u2019s the real deal to help him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi has been crouched behind the trash can for a good two hours, muscles stiff and stomach rumbling. The winter air is harsh and cold and blows against the tufts of his blue fur, making him shiver. It looks like it\u2019s going to snow tonight, and Yoongi doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His eyes catch on movement across the street, and Yoongi watches a man walking down the sidewalk towards the occult shop. All that Yoongi can tell from this distance is that he\u2019s wearing a big grey hoodie and he has blonde hair, but something about him has Yoongi perking up. The man disappears inside the shop, and Yoongi waits tensely for him to come back out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t have to wait too long. About ten minutes later the man pushes back out with a small brown bag clutched in one hand. Instead of leaving the way he\u2019d come, the man starts walking across the street towards the alley. Towards Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi freezes and presses himself to the ground behind the trash can. He enters the alley, not even seeing Yoongi trying to hide from sight, the bag swinging in his grip. He seems to be going through a checklist, lips pursed in concentration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDragonfly wings, eye of newt, pixie dust,\u201d he mutters to himself, ticking off a finger with each item. He passes barely a few inches by Yoongi, and the blue cat stealthy begins following him a moment later, pressing close to the wall of the alley. There\u2019s something about this stranger that calls to Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cStill need werewolf fangs and cuttlefish fins,\u201d the human is still talking to himself as he walks, unaware of Yoongi trailing him in the shadows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019s almost at the other end of the alley when he suddenly stops and spins around. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi freezes, but it\u2019s already too late. The human has seen him. \u00a0His eyes zero in on the skinny blue cat crouched on the rough, wet pavement, staring up at him with horrified green eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They stare at each other for a minute before the human seems to shake himself. \u201cHey there, little guy,\u201d he says softly. He sinks down slowly onto his haunches and lifts a hand in Yoongi\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 This close, Yoongi can see he\u2019s actually pretty young. Probably only a few years younger than Yoongi himself. He\u2019s got fluffy hair the color of wheat and a really pretty face. Full lips tilted up in a gentle smile and soft brown eyes curved into half-moons. His jaw is sculpted but his cheeks are round and soft, stained pink from the cold air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not gonna hurt you,\u201d he says calmly, his voice soft and light. Something about this boy\u2019s aura is calming and soothing, and maybe it has something to do with his new cat senses, but Yoongi can't help but feel a sense of safety.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi takes a tentative step forward, drawn to this young man for some reason. A gust of wind blows down the alley and hits Yoongi, making him shiver hard. The blonde frowns and wiggles his fingers enticingly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou look cold,\u201d he says, his eyes sweeping over Yoongi\u2019s ratty cat form. He\u2019s fucking freezing, and this kid\u2019s warmth calls to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi takes a few more slinking steps forward until he\u2019s level with the kid\u2019s small, chubby fingers. The human waits patiently while Yoongi stretches out his neck and takes a few hesitant sniffs. He smells like vanilla and toffee, the pleasant scent amplified by Yoongi\u2019s cat nose. Now <em>this</em> boy is definitely Yoongi's type.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi takes one more step closer, jumping and tensing when those small fingers gently begin scratching behind his ears. It\u2019s humiliating. He\u2019s a human, for christ\u2019s sake, getting his ears scratched by another human. But it feels so fucking good that a loud purr starts rumbling in his throat, startling him a little. It tickles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He leans into the blonde\u2019s touch, eyes drooping when the fingers scratch around the scruff of his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty kitty,\u201d the human coos to Yoongi, who feels his paw pads heating up in a blush. \u201cWhy are you blue, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi flicks his bottlebrush tail a little irritably, and the human giggles. It\u2019s a soft sound, sweet and a little squeaky. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi allows the human to keep scratching him for a while, going almost limp with pleasure. Then the boy perks up and bops Yoongi gently on his black nose. \u201cHey, maybe you were meant to be my familiar,\u201d he gasps, making Yoongi squint at him. He leans closer to Yoongi and whispers conspiratorially, \u201cI\u2019m a witch, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s eyes widen and his ears perk up. The blonde giggles again and rubs Yoongi\u2019s temples. \u201cDo you want to come home with me?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \"Can you turn me back into a human?\u201d</em>\u00a0 Yoongi asks, the question coming out as a series of loud meows. He boy giggles gleefully and stands up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d he says happily, then reaches down to pick Yoongi up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable, but the human is cradling Yoongi to his chest, and he\u2019s so warm and smells so good that Yoongi can\u2019t help but snuggle closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The human begins walking again, now with a blue cat in his arms. \u201cI live a few blocks from here,\u201d he tells Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi lets out a world-weary sigh and settles in for the journey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The boy\u2019s apartment is small and untidy, but cozy and homey and smells of vanilla and toffee. It's blessedly warm inside and Yoongi feels the tension beginning to seep from his body. The human sets Yoongi down on the kitchen floor and starts rifling through the cupboards.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have any cat food right now, I\u2019ll have to go shopping for that later. Will tuna be okay for now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is so hungry he would\u2019ve eaten just about anything. When the human sets a plate of tuna in front of him, he inhales it like a vacuum.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cNot so fast, you\u2019ll get sick,\u201d the human warns him, sitting down on the kitchen floor next to him. Yoongi pays him no mind as he licks up the last remnants of tuna juice from the plate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI wonder what I should name you,\u201d the kid muses to himself, and Yoongi turns his piercing gaze on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cMy name is Min Yoongi,\u201d</em> he meows reproachfully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The blonde snaps his fingers. \u201cHow about Se\u00f1or Cutiebutt?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi blanches. <em>\u201cYou've got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 The human must mistake Yoongi's yowl of outrage as a cry of agreement. He claps his hands together and giggles happily. \u201cSe\u00f1or Cutiebutt it is,\u201d he motions to himself. \u201cI'm Jimin, your new daddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi snorts but it comes out kind of like a coughing sound. <em>Daddy my ass,</em> he thinks to himself snarkily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Yoongi blinks balefully up at Jimin, not sure what to do now that he's eaten. Jimin, on the other hand, has a tense look on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey, no offense, but you smell really bad,\u201d Jimin says apologetically, and Yoongi\u2019s tail puffs up in offense. \u201cWould you shred me to pieces if I gave you a bath?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi does not shred Jimin to pieces. Instead he sits still in the bathtub, warm water up to his chest, and closed his eyes while Jimin scrubs him down with soap. Jimin's fingers massage into every inch of Yoongi's fur and it feels so wonderful he starts purring again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou're a funny cat,\u201d Jimin says, soaping behind Yoongi's neck. \u201cAren't you supposed to hate water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi ignores him and instead leans further into Jimin\u2019s touch. It should be weird; Jimin is washing what is technically Yoongi\u2019s naked body. He doesn't really want to think about that right now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once Jimin's done soaping him up, he turns on the tap and begins pouring fresh warm water all over Yoongi to wash out his fur. He avoids Yoongi's face and ears and pays special attention to his belly fur, which makes the cat purr harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally he pulls Yoongi, looking like a drowned blue rat, out of the tub and sets him on a towel. Before Yoongi even has a chance to start getting cold, Jimin is swaddling him in another towel and rubbing him dry. It's a little rough, but Yoongi doesn't mind, enjoying the pampering. Jimin discards the damp towel, wraps him in a new one, and carries Yoongi to the couch like a baby. He settles crossed-legged on the couch, places the wrapped up Yoongi in his lap, and turns on the TV.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It's getting dark out now, and the warmth of the towel and the heat of Jimin\u2019s body is making him sleepy. Jimin turns the channel to some black and white film while he scratches behind Yoongi\u2019s ears and yawns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cTomorrow I'll go shopping and pick you up some stuff,\u201d Jimin tells him. Yoongi settles more comfortably in his lap, too tired to be embarrassed. This is the safest and warmest he's felt in what feels like forever, and he's going to savor it, damn it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi must have dozed off in Jimin\u2019s lap, because the next thing he knows, he\u2019s being carefully lifted and then set down on something soft. Yoongi cracks a green eye to see he's lying at the foot of Jimin's bed while the kid walks into the bathroom. Yoongi hears the shower running a moment later, and he sits up with a mighty arch of his back and a wide yawn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Outside the window next to Jimin's bed, Yoongi sees that it's started to snow, and he shivers just looking at the fluffy white particles blowing around wildly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His fur is dry now, but it's sticking up in every direction, much to his annoyance. Yoongi busies himself with licking down his fur in attempt to tame it. He wrinkles his nose in disgust when he feels the long strands catch on his scratchy tongue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin comes out of the bathroom a little while later with nothing but a towel around his waist and damp blonde hair. Yoongi stops grooming himself mid-lick and stares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Shit, he's <em>toned</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin walks back into the bedroom, pats Yoongi\u2019s head as he passes, and walks up to his dresser to grab some pajamas. Jimin drops the towel and Yoongi jerks his gaze away. But not before he gets an eyeful of an extremely plump and firm ass.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 You fucking pervert,</em> Yoongi scolds himself while he pointedly stares up at the ceiling while Jimin gets dressed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin dresses in an oversized blue sweater that almost reaches his knees and plaid pajama pants. He pulls back the sheets of the bed and climbs in, rolling onto his side and making kissing noises at Yoongi while he pats the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cCome here,\u201d Jimin tries to coax, but Yoongi just gives him an unimpressed look. Jimin just shrugs and leans over to turn off the bedside lamp. \u201cGoodnight, Se\u00f1or Cutiebutt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The next morning, Yoongi wakes up enveloped in warmth. He cracks an eye to find himself face to face with a sleeping Jimin, the human\u2019s arms wrapped around his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Sometime during the night Yoongi had gotten cold at the foot of the bed and crawled under the covers with Jimin, seeking the boy\u2019s incredible warmth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi's green cat eyes trail over Jimin\u2019s peaceful face while he sleeps. His full lips are slack and puckered against the pillow, and his blonde hair is sticking up in every direction. His long lashes splay across his cheekbones, and the light filtering in through the window leaks across his body and lights up his smooth, honey tan skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He looks like a slumbering angel, Yoongi finds himself thinking in awe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then he shakes himself when he realizes what he's doing and stands up with a stretch. Jimin's arms slip from around him, and the movement makes him stir. Jimin's sleepy eyes blink open and a soft smile graces his features when he sees Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGood morning, Cutiebutt,\u201d Jimin says in an adorable voice raspy with sleep. He reaches a hand out to scratch behind Yoongi's ears, who leans into the touch despite himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin sits up in bed and rubs his eyes. He has creases indented in his cheek from the pillow. \u201cHungry?\u201d He asks Yoongi, who perks his ears and meows a loud affirmative. Jimin laughs and slides out of bed, and Yoongi hops off to follow him out into the living room, tail held high.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gives him another plateful of tuna and pulls out some cold, leftover kimchi from the fridge for himself. Yoongi looks between the plate on the floor and Jimin at the table. Finally he leaves the tuna and hops up on the table next to Jimin, who cries out, \u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Before Jimin can stop him, Yoongi bends his head and starts eating the kimchi straight from the plate. \u201cHey! Cutiebutt, stop that!\u201d Jimin tries to push him away, but Yoongi just swats at him with paws and keeps eating. It's probably the most delicious thing he's ever tasted before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Jimin slumps back in his chair and watches Yoongi in disbelief. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d he mutters as Yoongi gobbles up his breakfast. It's probably not very good for him in his cat form, but he doesn't really care.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin tries to shoo him away a few more times before he gives up and lets Yoongi eat the rest of the kimchi, instead pouring a bowl of cereal for himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWill you be okay here by yourself while I go pick up some stuff at the store?\u201d Jimin asks a while later when he's washing the dishes. Yoongi gives a little <em>mrrow</em> of affirmation and goes back to cleaning his face with his paw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin leaves the TV on for him while he's gone, and Yoongi curls up to watch reruns of Boys Over Flowers. He'd fallen asleep when Jimin gets home, but the rattle of keys in the door wakes him. Jimin pushes the door opened, arms laden with grocery bags, and Yoongi sits up on the couch to watch him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHi, Cutiebutt,\u201d Jimin calls to him, and Yoongi rolls his eyes at the name. \u201cWere you okay while I was gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi jumps off the couch and prances across the floor into the kitchen, hopping up on the table to watch as Jimin starts unloading stuff from the bags.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 There's a small litter box and a bag of litter, some cats toys, and a rectangle cardboard scratcher. When Yoongi sees a bag of dry cat food come out next, he immediately swipes at it with his paw, sending it crashing to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin yelps and jumps back in alarm. \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not eating that crap,\u201d</em> Yoongi snaps at Jimin, his meows loud and plaintive. Jimin picks up the bag and glares at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cStop being a little brat,\u201d Jimin bites at him, and Yoongi feels his tail start fluffing up. Jimin sets the cat food back on the table, not fast enough to stop him when Yoongi once again sends it crashing to the tile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cStop it!\u201d Jimin cries angrily, his cheeks all flushed and his eyes wild. He's cute when he's mad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi sniffs the air snootily and pointedly turns his back on Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Dinner is a dramatic affair where Yoongi absolutely refuses to eat the bowl of cat food Jimin sets before him. He meows and meows and meows until Jimin finally gives up with a loud cry and gives Yoongi some of his instant ramen. The blue cat slurps it up happily and laughs to himself at the look on Jimin\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They watch TV together after that, with Yoongi dozing off in Jimin\u2019s lap as the blonde scratches his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWill you be okay tomorrow? I have school all day and then practice after, so I won't be home until the evening,\u201d Jimin says later that night when they're in bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is by Jimin's legs, but he has a feeling he\u2019ll be joining Jimin under the covers soon. Yoongi doesn't like the thought of being home alone all day without Jimin or anything to do, but there's not much he can do about it. He kneads at Jimin\u2019s leg under the covers in answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou know, sometimes I feel like you actually <em>can</em> understand me,\u201d Jimin says, making Yoongi snort-cough in amusement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>If you only knew, kid.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi learns many things about Jimin in the weeks that follow. His full name is Park Jimin, he's originally from Busan, and he's a dance major at the local college. Everyday after school he spends two hours practicing with his dance mates, Hoseok and Jungkook. He hates mangoes and loves super sugary tea in pretty cups. He always does his laundry at the same time every week. He folds his underwear. He sings to himself whenever he gets the chance. He always leaves the TV on for Yoongi when he's not home. He loves extra marshmallows in his hot chocolate. He has a particular fondness for black licorice, which Yoongi will never understand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi learns that Jimin is soft and gentle and warm and kind, and so full of love it's incredible to Yoongi. He wakes up every morning cuddled in Jimin's arms, and every morning he's struck again by how beautiful he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He also learns that Jimin is a terrible fucking witch. One time he'd tried to cast a glamour spell on himself and had instead turned the wallpaper of his apartment a putrid yellow color. Another time he'd tried to brew a shrinking potion and almost caught his hair on fire when it exploded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI just need more practice!\u201d Jimin had defended himself shrilly at Yoongi\u2019s deeply judgemental look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is curled up on the couch watching a Korean dubbed version of Men in Black when he's startled by the doorknob rattling. He jumps up and glances at the clock above the TV. Jimin isn't supposed to be home for another two hours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The door opens and Jimin pushes inside, and the first thing a Yoongi notices is that he's crying. Alarm and panic flaring inside him, Yoongi leaps off the couch and runs to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em> \u201cJimin, what's wrong?!\u201d</em> Yoongi yowls at him, twining around and around Jimin's ankles, staring up at him in concern. <em>\u201cWhat happened? Are you okay?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin drops his stuff on the table and walks across the living room to flop down on the couch, eyes red and blotchy and wet with tears. Yoongi jumps into his lap and stares intently at his face, his heart breaking at the sight in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</em> He demands in a raspy meow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A sob rips through Jimin\u2019s chest and a fresh wave of tears spills down his face. Desperate, Yoongi rubs his head against Jimin\u2019s chin and purrs as hard as he can, trying to calm him down. <em>\u201cDon't cry, Jiminie, it's okay. Please don't cry.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stands up in Jimin\u2019s lap and places his paws on either side of his chest, bringing them face to face. He started licking at Jimin\u2019s salty tears, earning a watery giggle from Jimin at the feeling of Yoongi\u2019s rough tongue scratching against his skin. He's still purring furiously, booping his cold wet nose on Jimin\u2019s cheeks between licks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin wraps his arms around Yoongi and buries his face in his soft blue fur, seeming to take comfort in the sounds of Yoongi's purring. They stay like this for a little while until Jimin is finally calmed down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cWhat happened, Jiminie?\u201d</em> Yoongi asks again when Jimin finally pulls back. Jimin, unfortunately, doesn't answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi finds out later though when Jimin calls his best friend, Taehyung. Jimin is tucked under the warm covers of his bed with Yoongi pressed against his stomach. He'd refused to leave Jimin's side after what happened earlier, and Jimin seems to be grateful for his company.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey, Tae,\u201d Jimin says into his phone, sounding tired and subdued. \u201cYeah, I'm okay.\u201d There's a pause while Taehyung probably asked what happened. \u201cYou know my awful psychology professor? The one who I'm positive is the actual antichrist and has it out for me? Well today she called me out during the lecture in front of everyone and asked me a question that we haven't even covered yet. I got it wrong of course, and then she called me an idiot in front of everyone, said I should focus on dance because I'll never be smart enough for an actual career, and a bunch of people laughed. I've never been so mortified and humiliated in my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi feels rage sweep through him and he sees red. He clenches his hands--paws?--and vows that if he ever meets this woman he'll shred her to fucking pieces. Yoongi shoves his face into Jimin's armpit and purrs loudly. Jimin\u2019s response to something Taehyung said is cut off by his giggles at the tickling sensation. He tries to push Yoongi\u2019s face away but he just burrows deeper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt's-ah!-just Se\u00f1or Cutiebutt,\u201d Jimin giggles breathlessly into the phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He finally succeeds in pulling Yoongi's face out and bends down to press a kiss on his little furry head. Yoongi feels warmth overtake his body and he tingles pleasantly, little cat heart beating frantically in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWell, if you want to meet him then come over,\u201d Jimin says into the phone, stroking the bridge of Yoongi's nose. The scent of vanilla and toffee is so strong pressed up this close to Jimin, and Yoongi is drowning in it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Jimin yawns loudly. \u201cI'll see you tomorrow. Bye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He hangs up and places his phone on the bedside table. Yoongi crawls up to curl around Jimin's neck, purring softly when Jimin threads his little fingers into Yoongi's long fur.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGoodnight, Cutie,\u201d Jimin whispers, on the edge of sleep. Yoongi settles his nose into the crook of Jimin\u2019s neck and sighs deeply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em> \u201cGoodnight, Jiminie.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin keeps trying to get Yoongi to play with the cat toys. He really doesn't want to, but Jimin keeps tossing the little green mouse over and over, a hopeful smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGo on! Get the mouse!\u201d Jimin keeps cooing at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally Yoongi sighs in defeat and decides to humor him. If it'll make Jimin happy, he'll do anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He goes racing after the mouse when Jimin tosses it across the living room the next time, and Jimin laughs gleefully behind him. The sound is so pure and bright and wonderful that Yoongi decides acting like a cat for a bit is a small price to pay for it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin loses his mind when Yoongi carries the mouse back and drops it in front of him. \u201cWhat a good little doggy,\u201d the blonde croons at Yoongi, who rolls his eyes but secretly glows at the praise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He plays fetch with Jimin for a while until he starts to grow bored. Jimin seems to sense it because he stands up and heads into the kitchen. He comes back with a bag of some shredded green stuff and sits down in front of Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou want some catnip?\u201d Jimin asks him excitedly, ripping open the seal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 And, on no. Not gonna happen. Playing with toys is one thing, but Yoongi's seen how cats act when they're on catnip, and he's not about to act the fool in front of Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin pinches a little of the herb between his fingers and sprinkles it on the carpet. Yoongi tries to ignore it and turn away, but his nose seems to have a mind of its own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Next thing he knows he's sniffing at the carpet, and <em>holy shit.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 It hits Yoongi like a bus. His heart suddenly starts hammering against his ribs and his blood starts singing, racing through his veins. He starts feeling drunk and a little loopy, and it's <em>incredible.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 He shoves his face into the carpet and inhales deeply, feeling his body come alive. Yoongi rubs his face across the catnip, suddenly excited. His skin twitches. He flops onto his side and starts kicking at the carpet. Jimin is laughing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi feels incredible! He could take on the world! He wants more. Wants to sniff, wants to lick, wants to eat! He's wild and free!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He rolls onto his back and claws at the air. He's fast and dangerous like a tiger!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d</em> Yoongi yells, his meows loud and warbling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin laughs again. It sounds a little distorted. It's the best thing he's ever heard. Yoongi rolls over and latches onto Jimin's leg. Jimin squeals but Yoongi sinks his claws in, kicks at Jimin with his back feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 This is fun! Wow!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cStop!\u201d Jimin is still laughing, trying to retract his leg from Yoongi's grip. Yoongi swipes at him with a clawed paw when Jimin tries to push him away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 No! Jimin can't push him away! Jimin belongs to Yoongi! Jimin is<em> his</em>!</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em> \u201cJimin is mine, can't give to anybody!\u201d</em> Yoongi yowls madly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is still laughing. He is so beautiful! Like an angel! Jimin makes Yoongi's heart race and his tummy feel all silly and fluttery!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin grabs the mouse next to him and throws it hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oooh, prey! Must attack! Must kill!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi jumps up and races after it like the lethal predator he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The crash hits Yoongi just as hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 One minute he's diving at a piece of lint on the floor, and the next he's flopping onto his side and falling asleep, exhausted to the bone. Jimin's happy giggles twirl around his dreams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is really fucking glad he works for himself, or else he'd be in big trouble with a boss. He knows his parents have probably been trying to get ahold of him for the past month, but Yoongi's phone had been in his pocket when the sorceress had turned him, and he has no idea where it is now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Slowly Yoongi is beginning to accept that he'll probably never be human again. He's tried to communicate to Jimin over and over what has happened to him and how he needs his help, but the young witch just doesn't understand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That day when Jimin gets home from school, he finally brings Taehyung over to meet Yoongi. The kid is loud and has an incredibly deep voice, with big puppy eye and long ashy hair. He smells like cinnamon and too much cologne.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin introduces them, and when Taehyung reaches out a hand to pet him, Yoongi narrows his eyes dangerously at him. Taehyung seems to get the hint and retracts his hand, looking spooked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A little while later, Jimin and Taehyung are sitting on the floor of the living room playing cards, and Yoongi is on the couch staring at Taehyung, when he finally speaks up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI don't like him,\u201d Taehyung says, pointing at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin looks hurt and offended. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHe keeps,\u201d Taehyung flaps his hands around. \u201cStaring at me, like he knows all my deepest secrets and can understand everything I say. It's creepy. Plus, why is he blue? It's weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin glares at his best friend and strokes Yoongi's fur, as if he's worried the cat is offended. Yoongi just grins smugly at Taehyung, who gasps. \u201cHe just smiled at me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin whips around to see Yoongi primly cleaning a paw. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Taehyung splutters loudly, eyes bugging out of his head. \u201cI'm telling you, hyung, that's not a normal cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin rolls his eyes and grabs a new card. \u201cThat's because he's not a normal cat. He's my familiar and he's magical. And I'm pretty sure he <em>can</em> understand you, so be careful what you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Taehyung leaves a while after that, muttering about alien cats and creepy smiles. Yoongi is relieved that he's gone and he gets to have Jimin all to himself again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That night, Jimin is lying on his stomach on the bed studying, a highlighter sticking out of his mouth while he reads. Yoongi hops up next to him and comes face to face with the most glorious ass to ever exist. Yoongi's cat side must be starting to taking over, because he sees it and all he wants to do is <em>knead. </em>So Yoongi places both of his paws on Jimin's round, firm ass and begins kneading his cheeks as if they were bread dough. Jimin jumps and starts giggling madly, looking behind him at Yoongi, whose eyes are half closed and who is purring softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cThat tickles,\u201d Jimin complains through his laughter, wiggling his ass to try to dislodge Yoongi. Little kitty claws sink into his skin just enough to stop Jimin from moving and to keep him still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Yoongi realizes what the actual fuck he's doing, he freezes and his eyes go wide. Is he seriously kneading and groping Jimin's ass, for christ\u2019s sake? How much more perverted can he get?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi jumps away from Jimin\u2019s backside and instead stalks up towards his head. Jimin pushes aside his textbook and rolls onto his side, reaching out to scratch at Yoongi's scruff. Yoongi goes limp in pleasure and flops onto his side, closing his eyes as a purr starts rumbling in his throat. Jimin keeps scratching and rubbing until Yoongi is flat on his back, limbs splayed aside to allow Jimin access to the velvet soft fur of his belly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He feels so content, so warm and safe, bathed in Jimin\u2019s presence. He's starting to forget what his life was like before he was turned into a cat and met the young witch. Whenever he's around Jimin his heart races and fills with happiness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It's when Jimin leans in and nuzzles his face into Yoongi\u2019s warm belly and says, \u201cI love you, Cutiebutt,\u201d that Yoongi realizes;</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oh shit, he's completely head-over-heels (paws-over-tail?) in love with Park Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 All Yoongi wants is to be with Jimin. And if the only way to do that is to remain a cat forever, so be it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sometimes Jimin accidentally leaves the window that leads out to the fire escape open, but Yoongi never leaves. The thought doesn't even cross his mind. And when Jimin gets home on those days, he throws open the door, looking frantic and panicked. But when he sees Yoongi curled up in his favorite spot on the couch, he gasps in relief and rushes over to him. He\u2019ll engulf Yoongi in his arms and hug him tight, and Yoongi will think this is what true happiness is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Today is Saturday which means Jimin will spend all day with him. Yoongi likes Saturdays the best. Sundays not so much, because that's when Jimin runs all his errands, so he's not home as much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi wakes up from a short nap to find Jimin sitting on the living room floor, dozens of what look like spellbooks strewn around him. There are some candles lit on the coffee table next to Jimin\u2019s overly-sugared tea, some pretty crystal cluster pendants, and some bottles of herbs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oh great, it looks like Jimin is trying to do magic again. Yoongi's whiskers quiver in dread.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</em> Yoongi asks as he pads up to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin smiles at him and takes a sip of his tea. \u201cHey, sleepyhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cJiminie, what are you doing?\u201d</em> Yoongi meows again, nudging at one of the spellbooks with his paw to get his question across.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI'm gonna curse my evil psychology professor,\u201d Jimin announces. Yoongi's eyes widen in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cDon't be a fucking idiot,\u201d</em> Yoongi yowls plaintively, fixing Jimin with a glare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The young witch rolls his eyes at Yoongi and goes back to the spell book in his lap. \u201cI don't need your attitude right now, mister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 So Yoongi watches from the couch while Jimin puts together the spell. He throws a bunch of herbs together in a cast iron cauldron and sets them on fire while chanting some nonsense. It smokes like mad and Yoongi is shocked when the smoke detector doesn't go off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin takes a picture of his professor, (\u201cI printed it off the school website,\u201d he tells Yoongi) and sets that on fire as well. He waves one of the crystal pendants over the flames and mutters some more gibberish, and Yoongi wonders where he's getting this \u201cspell\u201d from.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The fire dies down, and both Jimin and Yoongi peer into the ashes with bated breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 For long moments, nothing happens. Then Jimin looks down and yelps loudly when he sees that his hand is starting to turn bright purple.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Within minutes, Jimin's entire body is the color of watered down grape juice. He looks like Barney the Dinosaur, and Yoongi can't stop laughing. It sounds like he's choking on a furball, but Jimin seems to understand that he\u2019s being laughed at. He glares at Yoongi and moans loudly, burying his purple face in his purple hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhy does shit like this always happen when I try to do magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi rubs along Jimin\u2019s side, still chuckling to himself. <em>\u201cMy pretty little grape,\u201d</em> he chirps, purring loudly to try to soothe a rapidly panicking Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin takes three showers and the color staining his skin only lightens by one shade. Yoongi pointedly stares at the carpet when Jimin comes out of the bathroom naked and dripping water. He never looks when Jimin changes or undressed, which Jimin gets a kick out of.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAlways such a little gentlemen,\u201d he cooed at Yoongi one time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin pulls on a pair of boxers and collapses onto his bed. \u201cI have school on Monday,\u201d he whines petulantly. \u201cWhat am I gonna do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi hops up next to him and begins licking at the strands of his damp blonde hair. It tastes faintly of strawberries. He flicks Jimin's turnip-colored face with his tail, who huffs and bats it away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c<em>You're still perfect to me, Jiminie,\u201d</em> Yoongi meows, touching his little wet nose against Jimin\u2019s, earning a soft giggle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The next morning, Yoongi wakes up to an only lightly lilac-colored Jimin asleep next to him. It makes his blonde locks stands out even more in the sunlight spilling in, and Yoongi stares at him in awe. He's surrounded by the familiar scent of vanilla and toffee, which Yoongi now associates with safety and home and love and <em>Jimin.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0Yoongi would give anything to hold Jimin in his arms as a human, to hug him and kiss him and be able to tell him out much he loves him. That's not something that's ever likely to happen though, so Yoongi will take what he can get.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi raises a paw and presses it into Jimin\u2019s cheek, marveling at the way Jimin\u2019s eyebrows furrow in his sleep. He pushes a little more insistently, because as much as he loves watching Jimin while he slumbers, Yoongi is hungry. When Jimin still doesn't wake, Yoongi starts licking the tip of his nose, enjoying the sweetness of Jimin\u2019s skin, like sleep and cream and sunlight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The scratchiness of Yoongi's tongue on his nose finally wakes Jimin up. \u201cUgh,\u201d he groans, cracking an eye to look at Yoongi. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Yoongi stops licking and rubs his head against Jimin\u2019s chin, purring when Jimin wraps his arms around him in a hug. His heart is so heavy and full of love for this boy that it almost aches. He could stay like this forever, wrapped up in Jimin's presence, his warmth and light and wonderful, familiar scent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin releases him and sits up in bed with a yawn, eyes widening when he catches sight of his hands. \u201cIt's faded a lot!\u201d He exclaims, jumping out of bed and running to the bathroom. \u201cOh, thank god!\u201d Yoongi hears him gasp, and he smiles to himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Obviously Jimin can't leave the house to run groceries, and Yoongi is ecstatic. He gets to have Jimin all to himself for the second day in a row!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They spend all day lounging on the couch watching movies and eating snacks. Yoongi keeps snatching Jimin\u2019s pretzels out of his hands with his teeth until the blonde gives up and pours Yoongi his own bowl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They cuddle for hours and Yoongi doesn't remember ever being more content. Jimin is the absolute fucking best at giving scratches, and Yoongi lays limp while Jimin pampers him, eyes dropping and purr rumbling like a motor. At one point while they're laying on the couch, Yoongi gets bored and starts nibbling Jimin\u2019s earlobe. Jimin squeals and tries to move away, but Yoongi drapes himself across his neck and continues gently nibbling at the soft purple flesh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oh, how he wishes he could do this as a human.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They go to bed that night curled up together under the warm covers while another snow storm whirls around outside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The next morning, Jimin\u2019s color has returned to normal. Yoongi lies on his chest and listens to the steady thumping of his heart, thinking there's nowhere he'd rather be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It's starting to become a little painful, how much Yoongi loves Jimin and how he'll never be able to have him. Not in the way he really wants. As more than just a cat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is lying on his back on the kitchen tile, bemoaning his situation and waiting for Jimin to get home, when the doorknob rattles but doesn't open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cShit!\u201d Comes Jimin\u2019s voice from outside. Yoongi hops up and stares curiously at the door. What is Jimin doing? There's some more rattling and some more cursing until the door finally swings open. Yoongi trots over to Jimin and rubs against his ankles, purring madly. Jimin almost trips over him as he takes off his shoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI lost my fucking keys and had to use the spare,\u201d Jimin tells him when he notices Yoongi's questioning gaze. \u201cIt sticks in the lock and is a huge pain in the ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After giving Yoongi a greeting scratch behind his ears, Jimin dumps the entire contents of his school bag on the living room floor in search of his keys. He then calls Jungkook to see if he left them at the dance studio.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDamn it,\u201d Jimin groans when he hangs up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stops batting around one of Jimin\u2019s pencil erasers and crawls into his lap. <em>\u201cPlease don't do magic,\u201d</em> Yoongi pleads in a series of chirps, already knowing where this is going.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin snaps his fingers and grins down at Yoongi. \u201cI'm gonna do magic to find them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi let's out a long-suffering sigh and wonders why he's in love with such an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDon't give me that look,\u201d Jimin glares at him. \u201cYou're my familiar, you're supposed to help me in my magical endeavors.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi rolls his eyes and hops off Jimin's lap when he stands up. He watches in exasperation as Jimin pulls out all his spellbooks and flips through them. He pauses on one page of an old leather bound book. \u201cThis might work; \u2018<em>to reveal that which is hidden\u2019</em>. It says all I have to do is recite the words and focus on what I'm trying to find,\u201d Jimin shrugs and smiles at Yoongi. \u201cSeems easy enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Jimin thinks magic is easy, that's always a bad sign.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin pushes back the coffee table to give himself room and faces the couch, while Yoongi sits behind him, next to the TV, to watch. Jimin holds the book in his hands and begins reciting the words written there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201cAllerio ma shaek ackni anni.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi barely time to think that those words sounds strangely familiar when there's a loud crack and a puff of pink smoke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Next thing he knows, a very human Yoongi is standing in Jimin\u2019s living room, staring at the witch\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Holy shit. Yoongi is back!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat was <em>that?\u201d</em> Jimin cries, whirls around, sees Yoongi, and <em>screams.</em> \u201cWho are you?!\u201d Jimin shrieks, the book dropping with a thud to the carpet. \u201cHow'd you get in here?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi raises his hands up in a calming gesture, seeing he's wearing the clothes he'd had on when the sorceress had turned him. Thank god. If he'd appeared in front of Jimin naked, he doesn't know how he'd ever live that down. \u201cJ-Jimin,\u201d Yoongi tries, his voice scratchy with disuse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin's face goes pale and his eyes go wide. \u201cHow do you know my name?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi clears his throat and tries again. \u201cIt's--\u201d a cough interrupts him. \u201cIt's me. I'm the cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 At the word \u2018cat\u2019, Jimin gasps and whips his head around, frantically looking for the feline. \u201cW-what have you done to my cat?\u201d Jimin chokes out, turning watery eyes to Yoongi. It makes his heart ache and all Yoongi wants to do is cross the distance and pull him into his arms, but he restrains himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJimin, it's me,\u201d Yoongi tries again. \u201cI\u2019m the cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Slowly the words seem to register and Jimin pauses in his panic. His gaze rakes over Yoongi and his eyes stops at his head of royal blue hair, and that's when Jimin seems to start working it out, his eyes widening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cS-Se\u00f1or\u2026Cutiebutt? Jimin whispers, staring horrified at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt's Yoongi, actually,\u201d Yoongi says gently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin sucks in a shaky inhale and swallows heavily. \u201cY-you're...human?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi nods and opens his mouth to explain, but Jimin lets out a strangled little sound and drops limply onto the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOh my <em>god</em>,\u201d Jimin breathes, looking as if he's on the verge of passing out. \u201cOh my god. You-I-we s-slept together. You--\u201d Jimin squeaks and turns flaming red. \u201cYou've seen me <em>naked.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cNo!\u201d Yoongi exclaims quickly. \u201cI never looked. Not once. Cutiebutt would always looked away, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin stares at him with watery, confused eyes. Yoongi sighs and runs a hand through his hair. It feels so weird to have all his limbs back, to be able to feel everything as a human again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cCan I sit? I'll explain everything,\u201d Yoongi asks gently. Jimin bites his lip and looks uncertain for a moment, but he finally nods and scoots to the very edge of the couch while Yoongi takes the other end.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi takes a deep breath. <em>You can do this</em>, he thinks to himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Forty five minutes later, Yoongi finally falls silent after telling Jimin everything. His throat hurts from talking so much after so long of not being used. \u00a0On his side of the couch, Jimin is rubbing idly at his temples, looking incredibly overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSo,\u201d Jimin begins tentatively. \u201cThis sorceress cursed you because she flirted with you and you turned her down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi nods and watches Jimin\u2019s face closely. \u201cYou know how sorceresses are. Always over-dramatic and easily offended.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin hums in absentminded agreement before fixing Yoongi with a wide eyed stare. \u201cSo, this whole time it was you? And you could understand everything I was saying?\u201d Yoongi nods again and Jimin groans loudly, his cheeks turning pink. \u201cI gave you a <em>bath.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi feels his own cheeks heating up. \u201cYeah, it was weird for me too at first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin's face keeps darkening. \u201cI cuddled with you and gave you belly rubs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi coughs a little awkwardly but doesn't answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin claps a hand over his mouth, eyes twinkling a little mischievously. \u201cI cleaned your litter b--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOkay!\u201d Yoongi interrupts loudly, face on fire. \u201cWhat matters is that I'm back to normal now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin bites his lip and nods. Then his brows furrow and he stares hard at Yoongi. \u201cWhy did you never try to tell me what was going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI <em>did</em>,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cBut up couldn't understand me and I had no idea how to get the message across.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou could've written a letter,\u201d Jimin argues back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi lifts his hands and wiggles his fingers. God it feels good. \u201cNo opposable thumbs, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin crosses his arms and pouts, and all Yoongi wants to do is leap across the couch and kiss it away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou could've\u2026\u201d Jimin struggles to think of something else, face screwed up in concentration. Finally he sighs in defeat. \u201cOh, I don't know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi doesn't say anything, and they fall silent for a bit while Yoongi waits patiently for Jimin to process things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIs that why you would never eat regular cat food?\u201d Jimin asks suddenly, looking up at him curiously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi grins at him shrugs. \u201cWould you want to eat that shit if you were a human?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin visibly shudders and shakes his head. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi chuckles and Jimin seems to relax slightly at the sound.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cSo when it looked like you were looking at me all judgmentally, you actually were? I wasn't just imagining it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi dips his head and smiles apologetically. \u201cNo offense, Jiminie, but you kind of suck at magic.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey!\u201d Jimin protests hotly. Then he pauses and goes bright red. \u201cJ-Jiminie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s eyes widen and his face flushes with heat. \u201cAh,\u201d he laughs awkwardly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They lapse into another uncomfortable silence before Jimin fidgets. \u201cUh, that one night where you started, you know...kneading my, um, butt\u2026was that human you or cat you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi kind of wants to die. \u201cCat me, I think,\u201d he says, blushing darkly. \u201cIt wasn't anything, like...<em>sexual</em> or anything. I wasn't groping you, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods meekly, his face rivaling Yoongi's in redness. \u201cWhat about that time I came home crying and you...l-licked away my tears?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 God, could this get anymore uncomfortable? \u201cThat was the real me,\u201d Yoongi decides to go with honesty, as painful as it is. \u201cI didn't like seeing you sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin looks stunned. His eyes blink rapidly and his mouth opens and closes, but nothing comes out. He looks like a little blonde goldfish, and god, Yoongi is so in love.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d Jimin finally breathes out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is about to say something when a harsh ringing from his jeans pocket interrupts him. They both jump about a foot in the air and Jimin let's out a little squeak of fright. Heart racing, Yoongi pulls out his phone and blanches when he sees the screen. 307 missed calls and 2,067 missed texts. Holy fucking shit. It's his mother calling, and Yoongi glances up at Jimin apologetically.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDo you mind?\u201d Jimin shakes his head and gestures for Yoongi to answer the phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Biting his lip in dread, Yoongi presses the answer button and utters out a meek, \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c<em>OH MY GOD,\u201d</em> his mother shrieks from the other end. <em>\u201cYOONGI-YAH, IS THAT YOU?!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHi, eomma,\u201d Yoongi smiles weakly.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0 \"WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?! DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE BEEN?! WE THOUGHT YOU\u2019D BEEN MURDERED! WE\u2019VE BEEN CHECKING ALL THE HOSPITALS EVERY SINGLE DAY EXPECTING YOU TO TURN UP DEAD. HOW COULD YOU NOT CALL ME TO TELL ME YOU WERE OKAY?! WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi pinches the bridge of his nose and squeezes his eyes shut. \u201cI'm sorry I worried you, eomma, but I'm okay, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou better have a damn good explanation about why you went missing for a month and a half,\u201d his mother sounds <em>furious</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 So Yoongi decides to tell her the truth. It's easier than trying to come up with some cover story. Jimin sits on the couch and listens while Yoongi tells his story, blushing prettily when Yoongi starts explaining him to his mom how Jimin took him in and probably saved his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He talks so long that the phone pressed against his ear begins to ache painfully. Finally he falls silent and waits for his mother to process what he just said. \u201cWell,\u201d she finally says, sounding a little faint. \u201cI'd like to invite this Jimin to dinner to say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Yoongi chuckles awkwardly and glances at Jimin. \u201cI'll, uh, ask him.\u201d Jimin perks up and eyes Yoongi curiously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cCome see us soon, Yoongi-yah,\u201d his mother says, sounding choked up. \u201cWe've missed you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYeah, okay. I have to go now, eomma,\u201d Yoongi says, suddenly feeling tired to the bone out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI love you, sweetie,\u201d she replies. \u201cCall soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLove you too,\u201d Yoongi says back before hanging up. He leans back against the couch and lets out a weary sigh. He can feel Jimin\u2019s gaze on his face but he can't bring himself to look at the witch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHow did she take it?\u201d Jimin asks quietly from across the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi shrugs and rubs at his tired eyes. \u201cSurprisingly well. She invited you to dinner to say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin's eyes widen and he goes pink. \u201cOh, I hardly did anything,\u201d he waves his hand dismissively, but his words come out a bit shaky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI beg to differ,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cWho knows what would've happened to me if you hadn't brought me home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin can't even bring himself to meet Yoongi's eyes. His cheeks and even the tips of his ears are flaming red. Yoongi wants to touch, to feel the heat of his skin with him human fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Jimin shifts a little uncomfortably and glances at the clock above the TV, Yoongi feels like a bucket of ice cold water has been dumped on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Technically, he doesn't live here. This is Jimin\u2019s apartment, not his. He's not a cat anymore and Jimin is probably trying to find a polite way to ask him to leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The thought of being away from Jimin, who he's been in the presence of every day for a month and a half, is physically, unbearably painful. Trying to imagine not waking up wrapped in Jimin's vanilla and toffee warmth, to not see him when he gets home from practice, to not watching TV together on the couch at night, pierces Yoongi right through the heart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 But he forces himself to think about this situation from Jimin\u2019s perspective; one second he's with his beloved cat, and the next he's facing some stranger spouting a crazy story and invading his personal space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 As much as it hurts, Yoongi doesn't want Jimin to be uncomfortable. He clears his throats and stands up. \u201cI should, uh, probably...go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin jumps up as well and looks uncertain. \u201cO-oh, okay. Are you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 Fuck no I\u2019m not sure</em>. \u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi tries to smile reassuringly, but it comes off more like a grimace. \u201cI probably have piles of mail to sort through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods, still a little uncertain, and walks him to the front door. They stand there awkwardly for a moment while Jimin rubs the back of his neck. \u201cWell, um, good luck,\u201d he finally says, and Yoongi absolutely<em> hates</em> how it sounds like a goodbye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cThanks,\u201d he forces a smile back. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then he's stepping out into the cold hallway and leaving Jimin behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <strong><em>Eviction Notice.</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 That's the sign that greets Yoongi when he trudged up three flights of stairs to his apartment door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cShit,\u201d Yoongi hisses, feeling panic rise inside of him. With a sinking heart he realizes while he was stuck as a cat he hadn't been able to pay rent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He makes his way down the to the front office and pleads with the landlord, but he's a big, brutish man who couldn't care less why Yoongi didn't pay his rent. In the end he allows Yoongi in the apartment to pack up his essentials, and then he gives Yoongi a number of a storage company that'll transfer his stuff to a unit there for an added fee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once he has most of his clothes, his laptop, some of his recording equipment, and a few other basic essentials, Yoongi slumps on a bench out by the street, homeless and freezing. It's looks like another snow storm tonight, and he doesn't know what he's going to do. It's getting progressively darker and the temperature keeps dropping by the minute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Shivering and miserable, Yoongi thinks about calling Namjoon to ask if he can stay with him and Jin for a little, but then he remembers they're still on their honeymoon in Europe. His parents are back in Daegu, and anyone else Yoongi can think of, he's not good enough friends with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Shit. That only leaves him one option.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 When Jimin opens the door, it looks like the last thing he expects is his former cat to be standing on the other side, shivering, pink-cheeked, and carrying a large duffle bag. The burst of warm air from inside and the smell of vanilla and toffee washes over him, and Yoongi immediately finds himself relaxing. Jimin looks beautiful as usual, in a big beige sweater with messy blonde hair, and Yoongi wants to hug him so bad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin blinks at him in surprise, mouth popping open. \u201cYoongi-ssi? What are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Flushing in embarrassment, Yoongi tells Jimin about his situation, about the eviction and his landlord.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSo you need a place to stay?\u201d Is the first thing Jimin says, and Yoongi wants to sink into the floor in embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOnly until I can figure something out. It's totally fine if you don't want to, I know how weird this probably is for you--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt's fine, Yoongi-ssi,\u201d Jimin interrupts him with a gentle smile. \u201cI mean, we've sort of been living together this whole time, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stares at him, stunned. He hadn't \u00a0expected Jimin to agree so easily, or even at all. When Jimin steps aside and opens the door wider, it takes Yoongi a second to get his feet to move.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d He asks as Jimin closes the door behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOf course,\u201d Jimin replies, gesturing for Yoongi to take off his shoes, which he does. Jimin's cheeks go a little pink and he looks at the carpet. \u201cTo be completely honest, it felt really weird after you left. I'm so used to having Cu--er, cat you around that suddenly being alone was strange.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stares at Jimin in awe, feelings of love and affection bubbling up in his chest. Yoongi smiles at Jimin and says a little teasingly, \u201cYou mean <em>Se\u00f1or Cutiebutt?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin groans and hides his face in his hands. \u201cI can't <em>believe</em> I named you that,\u201d he whines while Yoongi sets his bag on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi chuckles and has to force himself from crossing the distance and taking Jimin into his arms. He looks around the familiar apartment and can't help but feel incredibly relieved that he's home.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0 Home.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When did Jimin's apartment become home? When did <em>Jimin</em> become home?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Something on his face must be off, because Jimin frowns and cocks his head at Yoongi. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi startles, his gaze flicking back to Jimin. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says a little too quickly. \u201cIt's just...good to be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 For whatever reason, Jimin\u2019s eyes widen and he blushes. Yoongi just wants to kiss across those plump pink cheeks, feel the heat of them beneath his lips. Feel how they go even hotter at his touch.</p>\n<p>Jimin coughs awkwardly and rubs his cute nose. \u201cUm, I was gonna order some food. Do want to like, take a shower of anything while we\u2019re waiting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi narrows his eyes, wondering if Jimin is trying to hint at something. But it looks like Jimin is just being nice, seeing as Yoongi is still frozen with cold and shivering slightly. \u201cThat sounds great,\u201d he says, running a tired hand through his blue hair. \u201cIt's been forever since I've taken a shower as a human.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 And holy shit, did he forget how incredible a scalding hot shower could be. Yoongi stands under the hot spray, head bowed and limbs loose and relaxed, feeling more like himself by the moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once his body is raw and pink, Yoongi washes up with Jimin\u2019s strawberry shampoo and his vanilla bar soap. It smells so much like Jimin that Yoongi has to pause for a moment, suddenly dizzy with it. His heart pounds painfully in his chest as the scent washes over him, and makes him a little weak in the knees. He allows himself to simply stand there for a moment, absorbing the scent that is so wonderful to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally, when his entire body starts looking like a prune, Yoongi turns the shower off and dries off with one of Jimin's soft, fluffy towels hanging on the rack. It feels incredible against his bare human skin, and Yoongi savors it for a bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When he comes out of the bathroom dressed in a loose black t shirt and some old pajama pants, Jimin is setting the table. He looks up at Yoongi's arrival and smiles, and Yoongi feels his heart stop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Jimin greets him. \u201cThe food just got here, go ahead and sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi and Jimin eat the chinese takeout, and Yoongi answers Jimin's tentative questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWas it weird not having thumbs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDid you ever get hair balls?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat was it like having a tail?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat was it like being on catnip?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi answers his questions patiently, and though it's a little awkward at times, he can sense Jimin starting to become a little more comfortable with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When it's time for bed, Jimin brings out piles of blankets and waves away Yoongi's protests when he starts making up the couch for him instead of Yoongi. Neither of them mention that it'll be the first time they\u2019re sleeping apart in what feels like ages.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The first night sleeping without Jimin is difficult, to say the least. Yoongi tosses and turns and can't seem to get comfortable on the couch he'd loved so much as a cat. He feels hollow and lonely and cold without Jimin, and even though he's just down the hall, it feels like he's miles away. Yoongi didn't realizes how accustomed to Jimin's warm, comforting presence he'd become to as a cat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi doesn't fall into a fitful sleep until the early hours of dawn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Over the next few weeks, it's Jimin's turn to get to know Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He learns that Yoongi is from Daegu and that his family still lives there. That Yoongi left home because his parents originally didn't approve of his choice of career, but they've since accepted it. He discovers Yoongi hates cilantro and loves lamb skewers and banana milk. He is incredibly organized and doesn't mind clutter in Jimin's apartment but hates it in his workspace, A.K.A, the coffee table. He doesn't fold his underwear and waits as long as possible to do his laundry. He secretly loves Studio Ghibli movies and not so secretly loves Kumamon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He learns that Yoongi is a music producer who's going through a bit of a dry spell at the moment. Despite that, he still spends hours every day diligently trying to come up with new material. Sometimes he'll let Jimin listen to what he's been working on, and Yoongi can't help his smile at the way Jimin always gets so excited on those occasions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The more Jimin gets to know him, the more he opens up and reverts back to the Jimin that Yoongi knew as a cat. The one he fell in love with. No longer shy and awkward but loud and giggly and a little bit bratty at times. He calls Yoongi \u2018hyung\u2019 now, and every time Yoongi hears the honorific, it makes his heart beat a little faster and his insides all gooey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Jimin gets home that evening, Yoongi is on the couch with his heavy headphones on while he works on his laptop. He slides them off immediately when Jimin pushes through the door, damp with sweat in his dance clothes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHi, hyung,\u201d Jimin grins at him while he kicks off his shoes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi feels himself melting at the breathtaking sight of his smile. \u201cHi, Jiminie,\u201d he smiles back, closing his laptop and setting it on the coffee table. \u201cHow was practice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin collapses onto the couch next to Yoongi and sighs dramatically. \u201cHoseok hyung is driving us into the ground with this new choreography,\u201d he pulls his legs onto the couch and rubs at his small, cute foot. \u201cI can't even feel my feet right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi forces himself to wipe the dopey, adoring look off his face before Jimin catches the expression. \u201cPoor baby,\u201d Yoongi murmurs, enjoying Jimin's scowl. \u201cDo you want me to make you some hot chocolate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin's eyes light up and he nods happily. \u201cWith--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cExtra marshmallows, I know,\u201d Yoongi interrupts as he stands up. Jimin looks a little surprised before he starts grinning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI keep forgetting that you already know lots of stuff about me,\u201d he says as Yoongi enters the kitchen.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 Know you and love you</em>, Yoongi thinks to himself as he grabs two mugs out of the cupboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They drink their hot chocolate while watching crappy dubbed movies, sitting close but not close enough for Yoongi's liking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That night he goes to bed on the couch and once again has trouble sleeping without Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi gets home one Sunday afternoon, arms laden with grocery bags, to find Jimin sprawled on his stomach across the couch, his nose buried in a textbook and endless pieces of homework strewn around him. He looks up when Yoongi comes in and beams at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey, hyung!\u201d He chirps in greeting, setting the book down and sitting up. \u201cHow was grocery shopping?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It had been Yoongi's turn to shop, part of the agreement he'd practically forced on Jimin; \u201cI'm not gonna live here rent-free and and do nothing else to contribute,\u201d he'd said firmly, ignoring Jimin's protests.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cBusy,\u201d Yoongi replies tiredly, dropping the bags on the kitchen table. He fishes around inside them until he finds what he's looking for. He pulls out the packet of black licorice vines, wrinkling his nose in distaste.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Yoongi says, and Jimin looks up. \u201cCatch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He tosses the packet through the air and Jimin catches it gracefully. He looks down at the candy and his eyes widen in surprise. \u201cBlack licorice!\u201d He exclaims, staring up at Yoongi with starry eyes. \u201cHow'd you know I love them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Yoongi smiles at him softly and rubs his neck, feeling suddenly shy. \u201cI know <em>you,</em> Jiminie,\u201d he shrugs, cheeks going pink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 An expression of pure <em>wonder</em> seems to cross Jimin's face as he stares at Yoongi, his own cheeks darkening as well. The look he gives Yoongi is so full of awe and amazement that Yoongi is forced to look away from the intensity of it, instead busying himself with unloading the groceries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi doesn't notice the way Jimin keeps sneaking looks at him in between his studying.<br>\n\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi can't tell if he's imagining it or not when Jimin starts glancing at him a little more. When he starts giggling more often and blushing easier and more frequently around Yoongi. He can't tell whether the casual, fleeting touches mean something more or if it's just Jimin's natural personality shining through. Yoongi doesn't want to misread the situation, get his hopes up for nothing, or, god forbid, misinterpret and make an unwanted move on Jimin. He doesn't even want to think how that would end.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 One morning, Yoongi awakes from a fitful sleep earlier than usual. Jimin is still asleep in his room and won't be up for a bit, so Yoongi rolls over and tries to fall back asleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After about ten minutes Yoongi gives up and decides to get up. He rubs a hand over his face and through his fluffy blue hair, deciding he'll go down to the nearby coffee shop and surprise Jimin with breakfast. He dresses quickly in a hoodie and rumpled jeans and quietly leaves the apartment. He realizes halfway down the street that he forgot his phone, but decides he'll be fine without it for a little bit and doesn't go back for it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Coincidentally, the nearest coffee shop happens to be the exact same one Yoongi first met the sorceress in. Immediately weary, he sidles inside and looks around, prepared to make a break for it at a second\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The cafe is fairly empty so he deems it safe to step in. Yoongi orders himself a black coffee and Jimin an iced chai, heavy on the sweetener, and two breakfast sandwiches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It's as he's waiting for his order to be prepared that Yoongi feels an odd tingling run through him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWell, well. Look who we have here,\u201d comes a horribly familiar female voice from behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi spins around and freezes. The sorceress who turned him into a cat is standing there in a yellow sundress and high beige wedges. Her long hair is braided down her back and her smile is dangerous as her gaze sweeps over him. \u201cY-you,\u201d Yoongi breathes shakily, his flight-or-fight kicking in. He backs up a step and hits the counter, gulping when her predatory eyes follow his movements. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She cocks her head and smirks. \u201cOh, relax. I'm in a good mood today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi knows better than to trust her word. He eyes her suspiciously, ready to run if needed. Her eyes narrow at him and she looks intrigued. <em>\u201cHow</em> did you turn back, though? Spells like that don't just wear off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLike I\u2019d tell you,\u201d he snaps, instantly regretting it when her mouth tightens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cStill as rude as ever, I see,\u201d she says casually, lifting a hand and examining her manicured nails.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Heart racing in his chest, Yoongi edges along the counter towards the door. \u201cW-what are you gonna do to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Her eyes flicker in amusement. \u201cNothing, silly. Like I said, I'm in a good mood,\u201d then she cocks her head and her eyes zero in on Yoongi with an intensity that makes him burn. He's not expecting what she says next;</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOmo...you're in <em>love</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi chokes on his own tongue, the gears in his head grinding to a halt. <em>\u201cWhat?\"</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 She chuckles as her gaze sweeps over him again. \u201cIts radiating off you like sunlight. Anyone with magic could see it a mile away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi's heart stutters to a halt, a horrible thought hitting him. Does that mean that Jimin....</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>\u201c...anyone?\u201d</em> Yoongi croaks, throat dry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She shrugs her small shoulders. \u201cAnyone worth their salt, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oh, thank god. So not Jimin then.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHow you managed to fall in love while you were stuck as a cat is beyond me,\u201d she says, looking at Yoongi curiously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He's saved from having to answer by the barista calling his name. Yoongi turns, snatches up the paper bag and drink carrier, and hightails it out of there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGood luck with everything!\u201d The sorceress laughs behind him as he goes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The entire way home, Yoongi keeps looking manically over his shoulder, terrified she'd changed her mind and decided to finish him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Yoongi gets back to the apartment, he has to juggle the food in order to get the key in the lock. Jimin had given him a copy a while ago, making Yoongi glow with warmth. Jimin had found the keys he lost in his jeans pocket the day after Yoongi turned back into a human. He had been very embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi had just shut the door behind him and put the food and drinks on the table when rapid footsteps pound down the hall. Jimin careens into the kitchen, wild-eyed and frantic, panting as if he'd just run a mile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJiminie?\u201d Yoongi asks, concern flooding him at the sight of the witch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin skids across the tile and throws his arms around Yoongi with a gasp. \u201cI thought you'd left,\u201d he cries, sounding on the verge of tears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi's mind goes completely blank with shock. On instinct, his arms circle around Jimin's waist and he holds him close. Yoongi hasn't been this close to Jimin's vanilla and toffee scent in forever, and he has to stop himself from burying his nose in Jimin's blonde hair, messy and soft from sleep, and inhaling deeply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJiminie? What are you talking about?\u201d Yoongi finally asks, his voice a little hoarse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI...I woke up and you weren't here, and I thought that you'd left,\u201d Jimin whispers into his shoulder, and Yoongi realizes with horror that he's shaking slightly. \u201cI tried to call you but you left your phone on the couch, and I thought\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey, hey,\u201d Yoongi says softly, rubbing a hand in soothing circles across Jimin's back. \u201cIt's okay. I'm here, I didn't leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin pulls back just enough to be able to look at Yoongi's face, and his heart shatters when he sees his eyes are watery and filled with tears. Jimin's bottom lip is quivering slightly, and Yoongi just wants to kiss the pout away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI just went to get us breakfast,\u201d Yoongi says, nodding his head at the table. Jimin follows his gaze and promptly turns pink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d he blinks, then lets out a watery, breathless laugh. \u201cI guess I overreacted a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Yoongi just smiles fondly at him and tries not to let his disappointment show when Jimin finally loosens his arms and steps out of Yoongi's embrace a long moment later. Unless he's imagining it, Jimin seems a little reluctant as well, his movements slow and unsure as he detaches from Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt's okay,\u201d Yoongi assures him gently, watching Jimin's flush spread to the tips of his ears. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Seeming to recover a little, Jimin smiles tentatively and nods, plopping down at the table. \u201cIs this a chai?\u201d Jimin asks, picking up his iced drink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi nods and pulls out the sandwiches. \u201cWith extra sweetener.\u201d Jimin giggles and slurps happily at his drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They eat their breakfast and Yoongi doesn't bring up the delicate matter of Jimin's freak out, since he's obviously still embarrassed about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Halfway through, Yoongi decides to tell Jimin about the sorceress.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \"What!\u201d</em> Jimin yelps loudly, a bit of egg from his sandwich going flying. \u201cShe was there?! You talked to her?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Trying to keep a straight face over Jimin's adorable reaction, Yoongi nods. \"I was scared she was going to do something else to me, but she said she was in a good mood and just talked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin's eyes go wide as the moon and he leans over the table. \u201cWhat did she talk about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Memories of his conversation with the sorceress flash through his mind, and Yoongi dips his head over his sandwich to hide his blush. \u201cJust, you know...how I changed back and stuff,\u201d Yoongi mumbles vaguely. When Jimin starts to look a little alarmed, Yoongi quickly adds, \u201cI didn't say anything about you, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin scowls to himself and wrings his hands, as if imagining a neck between them. \u201cIf I ever come across her, I'll\u2026I'll\u2026\u201d he casts about for something to say. \u201cVaporize her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi can't keep a straight face this time. Jimin glowers angrily at him when he starts laughing. \u201cWhat's so funny?\u201d Jimin demands hotly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJiminie, you can't even cast a simple spell without turning the wallpaper different colors,\u201d Yoongi chuckles, finding Jimin's annoyed expression incredibly cute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI just need more practice, is all!\u201d Jimin says heatedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi just reached across the table and ruffles Jimin's wheat-colored hair fondly. \u201cWhatever you say, Minnie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin glares at him. \u201cIt's true!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That night, Yoongi lies, once again, awake upon his made up bed on the couch. For the countless night in a row, sleep eludes him. Even after all this time of not being with Jimin while he's sleeping, he just can't seem to get used to it. He glances at the clock above the TV, illuminated by a streetlight outside, and sighs wearily when he sees it's a quarter past three in the morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He's debating on whether or not to pull out his headphones and laptop and try to get some work done, when the floor squeaks behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung?\u201d A quiet, almost whispered voice speaks behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi sits up quickly to see Jimin standing in the entrance to the hall, clad in pajama pants and a sweater that's too big for him. His sweater paws dangle by his side and his honey hair is a tousled mess.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cMinnie?\u201d Yoongi says, concern washing over him. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods quickly and he swings his sweater paws a little aimlessly. \u201cI just, um...I was wondering...well, I haven't been sleeping very well since Cutiebutt...er, cat you, has been gone, and I was wondering if maybe...I mean you don't have to, of course, but um\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi sighs in fond exasperation. \u201cSpit it out, Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 There's a moment of hesitation before Jimin blurts out. \u201cCould you come and sleep in my bed with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi doesn't need to be able to see in the dark to know that Jimin is turning red. Before the witch has a chance to start apologizing and run away in embarrassment, Yoongi rises from the couch and crosses over to him. He takes Jimin's small, warm hand and holds it tight. \u201cOf course I will,\u201d he says softly. Before Jimin can even reply, Yoongi is tugging him down the hall and into the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They climb under the covers together, and god, has Yoongi missed this bed. They lay down with a little bit of space between them, facing each other, and simply stare. It's quiet in the room aside from their breathing, and Jimin's gaze seems to burn into Yoongi's soul.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A long moment of silence falls as they settle in. A few beats later though, Jimin starts edging closer and closer across the bed towards Yoongi, hesitant, as if he expects Yoongi to recoil away from him. Once his aborted little movements become too annoying, Yoongi sighs and hooks an arm around Jimin, pulling him flush against his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin let's out a surprised little gasp and freezes for moment. Then he melts into Yoongi and burrows his face in his neck, arm wrapping loosely around Yoongi's waist, and a small, content sigh leaving him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It's as if the entire world is falling back into place. Jimin is a warm, familiar weight in his arms, his body soft and so delicate, curved against Yoongi as if they were made for each other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 And the smell of him, <em>oh.</em> Yoongi's senses are dulled now that he's not a cat, but he can still pick up traces of Jimin's vanilla and toffee scent, and god, Yoongi thinks he could get drunk off that smell alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He nuzzles his nose into Jimin's hair and inhales deeply, savoring this moment. His arm drapes across Jimin's shoulders and his hand twist gently into the hairs at the back of his head, anchoring him in place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGoodnight, Minnie,\u201d Yoongi murmurs into the dark, quiet room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He gets no response, because Jimin has already fallen asleep. Smiling to himself, Yoongi follows him into the best slumber he's had in weeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi no longer sleeps on the couch. Every night, he and Jimin climb into the bed and curl up together under the warm blankets and quickly drift off to sleep, bathed in the other\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Not much has changed between them except that Jimin is even more clingy than ever. He hangs off of Yoongi every chance he gets, crowds against his side when they're watching movies, and throws all his weight on Yoongi when they're sleeping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When they go out in public together, Jimin has taken to holding Yoongi\u2019s pinky with his entire hand, sticking close and grasping the finger tightly. The first time it happened Yoongi almost fainted with the swell of emotions that hit him at the innocence of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Things are more comfortable than ever and Yoongi couldn\u2019t be happier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It's Jimin who kisses him first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It's late at night when they're both zoning out in front of some weird French movie, the lights in the living room dimmed. They're slumped together on the couch with Jimin's head resting on Yoongi's shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is almost dozing off when Jimin sits up suddenly and turns to him. He doesn't have a chance to ask what's wrong before Jimin is cupping Yoongi's face between his hands and pulling him gently into a kiss. He just barely has time to register the look of determination on Jimin's face before their lips seal together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His whole brain shuts down for a moment and he goes still. Before he knows it, Jimin is pulling away, starting to look mortified, but Yoongi stops him saying anything by surging forward and hungrily capturing Jimin's lips again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gasps into his mouth and melts into him. His lips are warm and so sinfully soft that Yoongi feels like he's drowning in them, in <em>Jimin</em>. Yoongi grasps Jimin's face in his hands and tilts his head back, allowing him an even better angle. Jimin shivers against him and goes all pliant and responsive. Yoongi rises up and pushes Jimin back on the couch, never separating their lips as he presses down on him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He licks across Jimin's bottom lip and he eagerly opens his mouth to grant Yoongi access. Jimin's mouth is hot and intense and tastes faintly of black licorice, which Yoongi finds he doesn't mind for the first time in his life. Jimin's hands come up to twist in Yoongi's hair, a little whimper escaping him when Yoongi licks hard into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 God, Yoongi has wanted this for so long, and now that it's happening, he can't believe it. It's better than he ever imagined.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Unfortunately though, they finally have to separate once Yoongi's head starts swimming from lack of oxygen. They both gasp loudly into the dim room, breath ragged as if they'd just run a marathon. In the background, the end credits of the movie are playing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin says breathlessly, tugging at Yoongi's hair until their eyes meet. His lips are red and swollen and wet. \u201cHyung...I think I'm falling in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Nothing can quite describe what Yoongi feels when he hears those words. Liquid sunlight erupts throughout his entire body, and he lets out a sort of sob, dropping to bury his face in Jimin's hot neck. Concerned, Jimin pats at his back uncertainly. \u201cHyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi hides in Jimin's neck for a second before rising back up to very seriously meet Jimin's eyes. He brushes his thumb over Jimin's swollen bottom lip gently. \u201cPark Jimin, I've been in love with you from the first moment I met you,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin looks shell-shocked. His eyes turn wide and his mouth drops open, giving Yoongi the perfect opportunity to sneak a quick kiss. \u201cYou have?\u201d He whispers, as if it's too good to be true.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi drops another kiss on his lips. \u201cAlways,\u201d another kiss. \u201cAnd forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin closes his eyes to absorb this information, a small, serene smile gracing his face. Yoongi feathers light kisses onto his delicate eyelids, making Jimin hum happily. They wrap their arms tightly around each other, and Yoongi rests his face in the crook of Jimin's neck. He almost purrs like Cutiebutt when Jimin starts carding his hand through Yoongi's blue locks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They stay like this for what feels like forever, and Yoongi is on the verge of falling asleep, when Jimin speaks. \u201cHyung, you said you've loved me this whole time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi shifts so he's looking blearily at Jimin's face. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSo you loved me when you were a cat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi narrows his eyes. \u201c...yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A mischievous glint enters Jimin's eyes. \u201cIsn't that sort of like bestiality?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi groans and pushes Jimin's face away with his hand. \u201cPark Jimin, don't ruin the moment, you little shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles and wraps both legs around Yoongi to hold him hostage, just in case he were thinking of leaving. He's not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI'm tired,\u201d Yoongi yawns after a while of them cuddling. \u201cLet's go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin waggles his eyebrows suggestively, allowing himself to be pulled up off the couch by Yoongi. \u201cYou gonna take me to <em>bed,</em> hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A flush rushing to his cheeks, Yoongi ducks his head to hide it while he pulls Jimin down the hall. \u201cShut up,\u201d he mutters, making Jimin laugh gleefully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Like always, they fall asleep wrapped around each other, except now there\u2019s an unspoken promise of <em>more.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They don\u2019t have sex for the first time until almost a month later. When they do, it\u2019s slow and sweet with Yoongi pounding a whimpering Jimin into the mattress with deep, mind numbing thrusts. He murmurs praises into Jimin\u2019s skin that make him whine and squirm desperately. Jimin cums with tears rolling down his face and Yoongi\u2019s name on his tongue, and Yoongi tumbles over soon after, burying his moans in Jimin\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Afterwards, Jimin lies, spent, on his stomach while Yoongi plays with his naked butt. Finally, he can touch it and appreciate it as a human. Jimin giggles when Yoongi starts kneading across the firm muscles his with palms, reminiscent of his time as a cat. Then Yoongi can\u2019t stop himself from slapping one of his plush cheeks. Jimin jerks and gasps and pushes up into the touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That eventually leads to round two. Apparently Jimin isn\u2019t as spent as Yoongi thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 One day, Jimin comes home later than usual. Yoongi is starting to get worried, and he\u2019s about to call him when the door unlocks and swings open. Jimin shuffles in, face guilty and arms hidden behind his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJiminie, where have you been?\u201d Yoongi demands, rushing up to him, but stopping when he sees the expression on his face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin smiles sheepishly at him. \u201cNow, don\u2019t get mad,\u201d is the first thing he says, and Yoongi is immediately on edge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJimin, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Instead of responding, Jimin pulls his arms out from behind his back. In his hands is nestled a fluffy grey kitten. It's staring up at Yoongi with giant green eyes, and it starts purring loudly as soon as it sees the blue-haired man.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJimin, what the hell?\u201d Yoongi gapes down at the kitten.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin pulls the kitten up to his face and nuzzles it. \u201cSometimes I still miss having a cat around, and I still need a familiar...so I thought...maybe...we could...get one\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is blinking at him with those pleading puppy eyes, and the kitten is staring at Yoongi as well, mirroring the expression with its big green eyes. And goddamn it, Yoongi has always been weak for cute things. Plus, if it makes Jimin happy, how can he possibly say no?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi lets out a long suffering sigh and reaches out a hand to stroke the cat\u2019s fur. It\u2019s bunny rabbit soft and the little thing immediately starts rumbling a purr. \u201cFine,\u201d he finally says begrudgingly. \u201cBut you\u2019re cleaning the litter box.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin grins at him, his whole face lighting up. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I already have lots of practice with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em> \u201cJimin!\u201d</em><br>\n\u00a0</p>"
