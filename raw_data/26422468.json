With no lingering tension...<br><br>\u201cKim Dokja. Is there a hidden clear method?\u201d</p>\n<p>A fitting finale to cement all misunderstandings between Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Kim Dokja.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>And he, Kim Dokja, did not get teleported anywhere. Definitely not in some sketchy, western-style five-star luxury hotel room, with a single king size bed. Kim Dokja didn\u2019t confirm that the cheap silkworm sheets are also of expensive quality, with a high thread count. And definitely didn\u2019t mentally confirm that the bed is large enough for two adult males.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no seductive mood suffused within this space, with the trashy, embossed chandelier hung from the center of the ceiling; the crude, intricate designs carved sloppily in the grenadilla branches. There are no candles; the lights glowing from the carving are enough to embrace the room in a dim, alluring light. Enough to see one another\u2019s features, but dark enough to cast soft shadows.<br><br>Kim Dokja is definitely not present in this room. He\u2019s off with the rest of his colleagues from his company, confirming the results from the main scenario they just completed, \u201cProof of the Stars\u201d.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Again, because this bears repeating: Kim Dokja is <em> not </em> here.</p>\n<p>\u300c Kim Do kja is stu pid \u2026 \u300d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk huffs, and grabs Kim Dokja\u2019s collar with both of his hands. He jerks him closer, brushing their noses together. Narrows his eyes and glares; tries to make Kim Dokja look at him. But there\u2019s no point in doing that, when all Kim Dokja can see is Yoo Joonghyuk. Since the very beginning.</p>\n<p>Still, Kim Dokja tries to lower his gaze, his dark lashes fluttering faintly against the stark whiteness of his cheeks. His heart thumps loudly in his chest. It\u2019s so loud, he can\u2019t hear it resonating from Yoo Joonghyuk. Can\u2019t hear them beating in tandem.</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Dokja, you bastard. What did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0His thumbs brush against Kim Dokja\u2019s neck, catching on the beads of sweat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u300cKim Do kja wants his hands around his throat \u300d</p>\n<p>This finally elicits a reaction from Kim Dokja, who blushes a fiery red. He shakes his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d His voice cracks. He abruptly shuts his mouth, biting on his tongue. The blush has spread to the lobe of his ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk stares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja trembles. How exactly is he supposed to explain this? The holographic message flickers, as if teasing him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[Hidden Scenario\u00a0 \u2013 The Fall of a Star]</p>\n<p>Category: Hidden</p>\n<p>Difficulty: ???</p>\n<p>Clear Conditions: Penetrative \u25fc\u25fc with incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk.

His calloused palms are warm. Immediately, Kim Dokja grabs Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u300c Kim Dok ja thinks : that\u2019s bett er \u300d</p>\n<p>No it is not, thinks Kim Dokja.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s fingers tighten against his throat, and Kim Dokja\u2019s blood rushes straight to his dick.</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Dokja,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk says. \u201cYou know nothing of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja opens his mouth and closes it. Opens his mouth and. And. Closes it. Opens again. Exhales.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mouth is getting dry. Better close it, in that case.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk observes this with a quirk of his eyebrows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d His voice cracks again. \u201c I don\u2019t know anything about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]</p>\n<p>[Your statement has been confirmed to be false.]</p>\n<p>Fuck!<br><br>Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s eyes darken. His fingers dig in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk, <em> fuck</em>! I\u2019ll talk, stop choking me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d replies Yoo Joonghyuk. But he doesn\u2019t release the pressure, resting his thumbs gently against the Adam\u2019s apple of Kim Dokja\u2019s throat. A heavy, undeniable presence. Kim Dokja gulps, causing Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s fingers to sink further in his throat. He wishes he didn\u2019t need to breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d he chokes out, hating how his voice has reached a particularly high, needy tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis.... particular scenario doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me. I didn\u2019t plan this!\u201d</p>\n<p>[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]</p>\n<p>[Your statement has been confirmed to be the truth.]</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk hums. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja looks at him indignantly. \u201cWhy would I want to fuck you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always been good at lying to himself.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk frowns. Perhaps he feels insulted because he\u2019s the protagonist. It\u2019s common knowledge that by default, everyone wants to fuck the protagonist. And anyone who doesn\u2019t want to is lying. Good thing for the both of them that Kim Dokja isn\u2019t a character in this novel\u2012 Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s protagonist halo doesn\u2019t affect him. Can\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk tilts his head. The lights from the chandelier pulses warmly over his red, full lips. Kim Dokja is momentarily distracted by his features; strong jaw, framed by sharp cheekbones. A glare that terrors the stars, but still beckons him. Kim Dokja\u2019s breath hitches. Did Yoo Joonghyuk press harder against his throat? He must have, with the way he\u2019s looking at him, his eyes more intense than usual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He must be angry, Kim Dokja thinks. Angrier than normal. Eyes dark like a starless night. An indescribable gaze. He doesn\u2019t know what that certain flavor of anger signifies, what that <em> look </em> means, ranging between minor annoyance and near-death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he had to make an educated, unbiased guess, then he thinks Yoo Joonghyuk probably wants to beat him up. Like every other time, with Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s hand brushing against his own as they walk through the scenarios.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Itching to rest his hand against his blade, instead. (Itching to hold his hand, instead).<br><br>\u300cKim Dok ja thinks : You kn ow what that loo k means. \u300d</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk says. Why is his voice deeper then usual? \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2013\u201d Kim Dokja bites his lip, worries it between his teeth. He\u2019d rather not speak more of this. He handles pain better than the truth.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk lowers his gaze, stares at the tongue disappearing and reappearing from his lips. He\u2019s entranced for a full minute, before snapping his gaze back to Kim Dokja. Who tries to shrink back into himself. And who doesn\u2019t answer. His tongue makes a reappearance instead, wetting his lips obscenely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Almost involuntarily, Yoo Joonghyuk tightens his hands around Kim Dokja\u2019s throat, making him whimper. Fuck, he really doesn\u2019t want to tell him. But Kim Dokja will\u2026 he\u2019ll end up getting an erection at this rate. And that can\u2019t happen.<br><br>\u201cS-Stop choking me,\u201d Kim Dokja whines. His heart has found its way in his throat, threatening to pour out of his mouth. His dick jerks in the confines of his pants.<br><br>\u201cSpeak.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s voice sings to him, pulls the beat of his heart higher in his throat. Louder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an insurmountable, impossible task to stop gulping in this situation. Which of course, means that Kim Dokja has failed. He\u2019s not the protagonist.</p>\n<p>He gulps. And the movement makes the fingers on his throat burn like a brand against his neck. His dick gives another twitch. His pants are too\u2013 they\u2019re too tight. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s eyes have never looked fiercer. Looking directly at him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not just a simple reader anymore.</p>\n<p>[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is shaking!]</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja closes his eyes. Breathe. Focus. This is nothing personal.</p>\n<p>[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 solidifies.]</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever heard of the Erotes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why did Kim Dokja bother to ask? He already knows all there is to Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey're a group of winged gods, commonly associated with love or desire. Followers of Aphrodite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk clicks his tongue. \u201cOlympus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Olympus had a hand in this. They\u2026 These particular gods are known for playing pranks like these. Even to the dismay of Olympus. And\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja tries to look away. But it\u2019s quite hard to accomplish this when the strongest incarnation in existence has his hands wrapped around your neck. And when he gives another hard squeeze\u2013 Kim Dokja has never been any harder. He knows his dick is probably leaking by now.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh-<em>hah</em>,\u201d he whimpers. Kim Dokja desperately tries to blink the tears out of his eyes. Pain or pleasure, he can\u2019t tell. Not like it matters, when it\u2019s Yoo Joonghyuk.<br><br>\u201cStop,\u201d he says. His voice is barely audible, low and needy.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk smirks. \u201cThe more I choke you, the more honest you become.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.that\u2019s not true,\u201d Kim Dokja says, weakly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]</p>\n<p>[Your statement has been confirmed to be false.]</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lip twitches, while Kim Dokja\u2019s face drops. He\u2019s never felt so humiliated.<br><br>He thrusts Kim Dokja against the bed, without letting go of his throat. And Kim Dokja willingly lets himself be guided, lets Yoo Joonghyuk press him to the bed. He still keeps his hands around Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists. Then Yoo Joonghyuk presses his knee against Kim Dokja\u2019s dick, and the world grinds to a halt.<br><br>\u201cUh, <em> ah.</em>\u201d he whimpers. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk shifts his weight from his foot to his knee, and presses down <em> hard. </em> A high-pitched moan escapes from Kim Dokja. It hurts, but it feels good, and it\u2019s not enough. He wants to come so bad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want me to stop,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk whispers. \u201cThen keep talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why does it sound like Yoo Joonghyuk wants the opposite? Like he\u2019s actually willing to fuck him?<br><br>[Your understanding of the character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has increased.]</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s pupils are blown wide.</p>\n<p>[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is shaking dangerously!]</p>\n<p>He needs to stop thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese minor gods\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja exhales, shakily. \u201cThey usually target couples, or couples-to-be. Or they instigate orgies and the like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Those </em> scenarios? I thought it was nonsense. People who weren\u2019t honest with themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s how they never get caught. One of their more famous gods is Eros, commonly known as Cupid. Which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve at least heard of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk makes a noise of understanding. He stares intently at Kim Dokja. Waiting.</p>\n<p>Waiting for what?<br><br>Kim Dokja licks his lips. \u201cAnd the reason why it\u2019s particularly difficult to stop their scenarios is because their probability feeds on desire and affection\u2026 Even if\u2013 if the scenario was requested from Himeros, the god of unrequited love\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk stills, and Kim Dokja feels sorry. He didn\u2019t want Yoo Joonghyuk to know about him like this.<br><br>He continues. \u201cEven then, Himeros is simultaneously the god of sexual desire. In any case, at least one of the targets has either feelings of love or sexual desire towards the other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asks, suddenly. \u201cAre you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja turns his head, tries to bury it in these stupid, expensive sheets, but Yoo Joonghyuk grips his throat harder, brings his face level to his own. If Kim Dokja stuck out his tongue, he could touch his lips. Yoo Joonghyuk blinks, slowly, and Kim Dokja can <em> feel </em>his eyelashes; those irritating, thick strands of hair. Can feel the heat of his gaze on his skin.</p>\n<p>[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 becomes thinner.]</p>\n<p>\u201cThe\u2013the only other alternative to clear this scenario is to get rid of the source of desire or love. It\u2019s impossible in most cases, which is why these scenarios are so successful. Or you can kill the target to remove the source permanently. Or...you remove what binds them in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja shuts his mouth. Then opens it immediately. He can\u2019t stand this teasing anymore.<br><br>\u201cYou can...cut it off. I\u2019ll become an eunuch. And this will clear the scenario, since it can no longer be accomplished\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja looks at Yoo Joonghyuk furtively. Then shuts his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease make it quick. My skill should block off most of the pain, and I can probably regenerate it back with the materials from the Dokkaebi bag.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust, hurry it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Dokja. Everything you\u2019ve told me until now... Is it true ?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI believe so?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s fingers tap against his throat, and Kim Dokja jerks. Fuck, why is he still hard in this kind of situation? Just the prospect of having Yoo Joonghyuk touching his dick in any matter makes him hard, <em> fuck</em>. Even if it\u2019s with a sword.<br><br>\u201cKim Dokja. Yes or no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he exhales. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s breath is warm against his lips. \u201cYes, what I\u2019ve told you about this scenario is true.\u201d</p>\n<p>[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]</p>\n<p>[Your statement has been confirmed to be the truth.]</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet, yet the air is tense. Electrifying. An impending, inevitable doom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s smile is blinding.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started, then.\u201d There\u2019s a hint of happiness in Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s voice, rare in appearance, stranger still than a fickle god returning your prayers. Kim Dokja is momentarily mesmerized.</p>\n<p>He only ever notices it few far and between the months(decades) they\u2019ve spent together: his lip upturned for half a second when he talks to his sister; when he cooks for his team; when he tortures Kim Dokja under the guise of medical aid, brushing his scarred hands against his injured skin\u2014and gone like a whisper in the wind. Fuck, since when was the protagonist so excited to cut off his dick? Kim Dokja thought his desires were pretty well concealed.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust get it over with.\u201d Kim Dokja grits out, embarrassed. He has his eyes closed, but he wants to cover them with his hands. But Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists feel more reassuring, somehow. So he squeezes his eyes tightly. Squeezes Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s wrists. And hopes he can\u2019t see the disgust on his face.<br><br>He waits. And then. And then\u2013</p>\n<p>Insistent, warm lips press against his. Kim Dokja makes a startled noise in his throat, lips parting. A strong, thick tongue invades into him, licks into his mouth. Yoo Joonghyuk releases his hand from his throat, and cups his cheek. Tilts his head in a way that invites his tongue deeper inside him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja is shaking. He makes cute little gasps every time Yoo Joonghyuk slides in his tongue. Anything he does overwhelms him\u2014 he\u2019s read thousands over thousands of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lives, but nothing compares to the raw sensation of <em> Yoo Joonghyuk</em>\u2019s lips against his skin. Nothing compares to feeling him form a smile against his mouth, groaning out his name in a revering manner.</p>\n<p>\u300cKim Dok ja thinks: this is bet ter than my dreams\u300d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja makes a loud, broken noise, before tearing his mouth away. He pants, his heart running a mile an hour. He\u2019s never, ever been kissed. Never dared to dream how warm his lips could be. Yoo Joonghyuk seems unaffected, except for how red his mouth is, and the satisfied smile resting on his face. The lights reflected in his eyes look like stars.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looks <em> happy</em>.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja can\u2019t\u2012he can\u2019t afford to think about what that means.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 becomes dangerously thin.]</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2013\u201d He gasps, shuddering. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u300cKim Dok ja is a fo ol \u300d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you become stupid after three years?\u201d There\u2019s fondness in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m kissing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk brings his mouth back to Kim Dokja\u2019s, but he covers Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips with his palm. Even this much skin contact is dizzying for him; his nerves are laser-focused on their point of contact. He hopes Yoo Joonghyuk can\u2019t see, can\u2019t feel how bad his hand is shaking.</p>\n<p>He should know better by now.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\u2012don\u2019t you want to clear the scenario?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tries to sound resolute.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u300cBut Kim Dok ja sounds hope ful\u300d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk tilts his head, exposing his tanned throat. Amusement trickles in his voice. Kim Dokja doesn\u2019t look at the muscles stretching to his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cForeplay is important, Kim Dokja. Even if you\u2019re a virgin, you should know this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s face burns. \u201cThat\u2019s not it! Just\u2014cut off my dick! I can regenerate it, it\u2019s fine! I won\u2019t die!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat won\u2019t clear the scenario.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you deaf? Did you not hear me the past few minutes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t regenerate my dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Huh?</p>\n<p>\u300cYou will al ways be a fo ol \u300d</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk silently watches Kim Dokja, how his eyes waver. His smart mouth pinched together in confusion, the worried crease between his eyebrows. His clever brain trying to process the information Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s given. Always trying to find the upper hand. The way out.</p>\n<p>But Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s waited a long time for this, and he won\u2019t let him escape that easily.<br><br>He licks Kim Dokja\u2019s palm, who immediately retracts his hand. Cups the back of Kim Dokja\u2019s head, kisses his lips. Tries to lick them apart. Kim Dokja whimpers, but doesn\u2019t open his mouth. Stubborn like always. Yet Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk releases his other hand from his throat and cups Kim Dokja\u2019s crotch. Strokes his thumb against the zipper. He hears a sharp inhale, and chuckles, softly. Lets his fingers rest there for a few seconds, then squeezes it tightly.<br><br>\u201c<em>Ah.</em>\u201d Kim Dokja moans against his lips, prideful little mouth open. Yoo Joonghyuk slides his tongue back where it belongs. His mouth is ever so sweet and alluring.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk fiddles with the zipper on Kim Dokja\u2019s pants, then pulls out his dick. He whimpers at the sudden exposure of air, and a bead of precome drips down his palm. If Yoo Joonghyuk found the touch of another male disconcerting, any doubts Kim Dokja had are squashed by the confidence of his actions.</p>\n<p>His hand wraps around the shaft easily, and the sudden contact immediately robs Kim Dokja of his concentration. Yoo Joonghyuk gives his dick a quick tug, which makes Kim Dokja stiffen and cling to the hard muscles of his back. He rubs him slowly. His whimpers are swallowed by Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s lips. Their kisses get sloppier; excess saliva trickles down the corner of his mouth.<br><br>It\u2019s a difficult decision, but Yoo Joonghyuk decides he\u2019d rather hear him instead.

Paler than his own, obviously smaller but it\u2019s...it\u2019s cute. A cute little curve, a perfect size. He runs his thumb across the slit, and presses down. Strokes him faster than before.

It\u2019s the sweetest sound he\u2019s ever heard. Ears ringing, his eyes slide shut.</p>\n<p>In the haze of Kim Dokja\u2019s post-orgasmic bliss, he hears Yoo Joonghyuk say: \u201cWe\u2019re not done here.\u201d</p>\n<p>[0 out of 5 \u25fc\u25fc COMPLETED]</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja struggles to open his eyes.

He humps against his thigh, relishing the heady sensation of his fingers in his mouth.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost sad when Yoo Joonghyuk removes his fingers from his mouth, a thread of saliva snapping away.

Joonghyuk, please... no more... <em> please</em>...\u201d</p>\n<p>[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]</p>\n<p>[Your statement has been confirmed to be false.]</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja sobs, and spreads his legs again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[TIME REMAINING: 14:35:59]</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk pulls out his fat cock from Kim Dokja\u2019s bruised, battered hole. Copious amounts of semen gushes out of him, rivulets trickling down the curve of his inner thighs. For the first time in his life, Yoo Joonghyuk is thankful to StarStream for being able to transcend beyond the limitations of an average human body.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja can\u2019t say the same, even as a constellation. He has no muscles to speak of, and a poor excuse for stamina. But that\u2019s fine. He made Kim Dokja drink two bottles worth of SS-grade succubi elixir provided from this subspace. It cost him 200,000 coins.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk flips Kim Dokja over, thrusts into him from behind. A lewd <em> squelch </em> filters through the room. More of his semen leaks. But that\u2019s fine, he always has more to give.</p>\n<p>He pulls out, then sheathes his cock back inside Kim Dokja\u2019s tight, wet, warm heat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja answers him with a garbled moan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll get his money\u2019s worth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[TIME REMAINING: 11:47:23]</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ah</em>, Joonghyuk, Joonghyuk\u2012<em>ah,</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja throws his head back as he comes, the curve of his neck gleaming in the limelight. The vulnerable dip of his throat is white and inviting. Yoo Joonghyuk mouths over the many hickeys and bruises he\u2019s left on his skin. He\u2019s getting close, and Kim Dokja whimpers as he picks up speed, too sensitive, too <em> much </em>\u2012</p>\n<p>Overwhelmingly good. He doesn\u2019t want this to stop, but he can\u2019t anymore, he just <em> can\u2019t. </em></p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk bites down again as he comes, his back tense in pleasure. Sinks his teeth in, lapping up Kim Dokja\u2019s blood. The pleasure sings in his veins. His hips jerk in shallowly, and he sighs. His curls stick to his sweat-slicked forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more,\u201d Kim Dokja croaks. Voice bruised, lips bitten. \u201cNo more.\u201d</p>\n<p>[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]</p>\n<p>[Your statement has been confirmed to be the truth.]</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk clasps their hands, slots their fingers together. Brings it to his mouth, kisses the back of his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Kim Dokja.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk murmurs.</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja\u2019s heart stutters. This is\u2012ridiculous. He\u2019s no protagonist. Succubi elixir can only increase his vitality to a certain extent. He\u2019s cracked open, drained, beaten down. He\u2019s got nothing more left to give him, nothing more to offer; he <em> can\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk brushes Kim Dokja\u2019s cheek with this thumb, kisses his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, softly, because he\u2019s in love.</p>\n<p>[Your understanding of the character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has increased.]</p>\n<p>[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint stage 2 has been activated.]</p>\n<p>\u300c... you..\u300d</p>\n<p>\u300c...

The little crinkles next to his eyes pull at his heartstrings. He kisses him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease? Just one more time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja doesn\u2019t think he can handle more of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s affection. He\u2019s not built for whatever <em> this </em> is. Whatever Yoo Joonghyuk thinks of when he looks at him, with a tender look in his eyes. He needs to step away for a bit, bring back the fourth wall. He can\u2019t, he can\u2019t, he <em> can\u2019t</em>\u2012</p>\n<p>\u300cI love you, Kim Dokja\u300d</p>\n<p>He has never been able to refuse his dear protagonist\u2019s happiness. Never been able to resist him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>[The character \u2018Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.]</p>\n<p>[Your statement has been confirmed to be the truth.]</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk grins, showing his teeth. And Kim Dokja helplessly smiles back. Welcomes this all-consuming love.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[TIME REMAINING: 01:23:27]</p>\n<p>The warm water droplets from the shower run gently on their skin.</p>\n<p>Nothing else needs to be said. They\u2019ve read each other's hearts.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s enough, for now. Maybe forever. Maybe beyond the confines of an ending.</p>\n<p>An epilogue of sorts, perhaps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[TIME REMAINING: 00:00:00]</p>\n<p>[All participants will now forcibly be expelled from the current scenario.]</p>\n<p>[Thank you for your time. We hope to see you again.]</p>\n<p>Kim Dokja blushes. Yoo Joonghyuk doesn\u2019t say anything, but he links their hands together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[You have been transferred to Seoul, Korea.]</p>\n<p>[The \u2039Star Stream\u203a has noticed your presence.]</p>\n<p>They find themselves in the outskirts of the Industrial Complex. Right outside the protective barrier charms. Yoo Joonghyuk looks at the nearby crumbling building with impassive calm, and begins his walk to the company base.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 appreciates incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s comradeship.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 has sponsored 1,000 coins.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 wonders what happened.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Great Sage Equal to Heaven\u2019 shows concern for your injuries.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 says you should have released your seal.]</p>\n<p>[Many constellations are inquiring about your well-being.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019 is looking at the constellation \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019 is smiling.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is looking at the constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is looking at the constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019.]</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Queen of the Darkest Spring\u2019 is telling the constellations to be patient.]</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Citizens of the Industrial Complex are often in fear or awe of their overlords, and Yoo Joonghyuk pays them no mind as they stare shamelessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been a strong fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Supreme King looks uninjured... but looking at our lord, it must\u2019ve been quite serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo many teeth marks\u2026 Was it a vampire?

Reach the main plaza, with flowers blooming from the cracked asphalt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk kicks open the door to the company base. The employees of Kim Dokja\u2019s company, relaxing in the lounge, stare at their dramatic entrance in a moment of stupor. Han Sooyoung apathetically keeps drinking her energy drink.</p>\n<p>Yoo Joonghyuk stares back, and walks past the lounge, to the second floor. He\u2019s stopped by Jung Heewon throwing her sword in front of him, the weapon digging in the concrete wall. The glint of her blade reflects Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s displeased face.</p>\n<p>[The constellation \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019 says to not damage company property.]</p>\n<p>Han Sooyoung rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, bastard.

All this stress for nothing.\u201d Han Sooyoung says, before popping a strawberry lollipop back in her mouth.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a split-second, before devolving into absolute nonsense.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way\u2012\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhjussi is too ugly\u2012\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhjussi isn\u2019t ugly!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOut of all times, you had to choose now\u2012\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgly, not on Master\u2019s level\u2012\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, I\u2019m sure Dokja-ssi wouldn\u2019t\u2012\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop saying Ahjussi is ugly!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can just ask Master, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll say\u2012\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2012No, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>They stare. Yoo Joonghyuk stares back, unfazed. Han Sooyoung cackles, and cracks open a can of beer.
