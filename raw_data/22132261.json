  "text": "<p>When Harry heard the rumours of a basilisk living in the magical part of the forest in Van Vihar National Park in India, he knew he had to go and find it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you gone insane?\u201d Hermione asked him once he confessed the destination of his next journey. He hadn\u2019t meant to tell her but Hermione had a way of pulling the truth from him even when he was determined to hide it. </p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Harry said and gestured up and down his own body. \u201cI\u2019m the first parselmouth in Britain in centuries. Maybe even the world. I\u2019ll just have a chat with it, nothing more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron was a little more reasonable than his fuming wife, but not much. \u201cMate, going to India to have a chat with a basilisk is a bit much, even for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged, which infuriated Hermione even more. \u201cI\u2019m telling your mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d he pleaded.</p>\n<p>She did.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, dear,\u201d his mum said later that day after she and his dad had invited themselves over for tea. Lily sat on the sofa, cup balanced in her hands while his dad paced in front of the fireplace. \u201cWe respect your choices, but going to hunt a basilisk is not a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gasped, insulted. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hunt it, Mum. I just want to meet it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, his dad stopped and pushed his glasses up his nose. \u201cJust because you can do...this thing, doesn\u2019t mean you should, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean parseltongue, Dad,\u201d Harry said, beyond tired of his dad\u2019s rejection of Harry\u2019s magical talents. \u201cI\u2019m a parselmouth that speaks parseltongue.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad waved his comment away as though it was irrelevant which only infuriated Harry more. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gallivanting around the globe for a decade now,\u201d his dad said in his most annoyingly lecturing tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I am a magical zoologist,\u201d Harry said loudly, but James fucking Potter, Auror extraordinaire, ignored him completely. Story of his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time you think about your future, Harry,\u201d his dad went on. \u201cLook at your sister \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Harry jumped up from the couch, glaring between his mum and his dad. \u201cI\u2019m a grown man of 33 years old with a successful career that I love. That\u2019s it. No need for your input. Thanks for stopping by. See you in a few weeks.\u201d And he marched to the fireplace, threw in a hand of floo-powder, called out Potter Mansion and waited with tightly crossed arms until his parents got the right idea and left. </p>\n<p>He loved his mum and dad but they drove him up the wall more often than not.</p>\n<p>The next afternoon his sister stopped by. \u201cIf you get eaten by a big fat snake I inherit everything, just so you realize,\u201d Hyacinth told him with a grin. </p>\n<p>Harry snorted but let Hyacinth pull him into a hug. \u201cSeriously, Harry, be careful please. Your niece or nephew wants you to stick around long enough for them to meet you.\u201d She gestured at her baby bump and Harry gave her a genuine smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll do my best not to get eaten. I have plans for your kid.\u201d Harry winked at her. </p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as those plans don\u2019t involve basilisks I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d She accepted a kiss on the cheek from him. \u201cSee you in a few weeks. Send us a postcard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p>\n<p>That evening his business partner stopped by. \u201cBring back some venom if you can coax it out of the beast,\u201d Severus said while accepting a tumbler of firewhiskey.</p>\n<p>All throughout Harry\u2019s childhood and adolescence, his \u2018uncle Sev\u2019, as Lily insisted Harry and Hyacinth call him, had looked down his hooked nose at Harry. The man was Hyacinth\u2019s godfather and perfectly friendly towards her, but Harry hadn\u2019t had a decent interaction with the man until he was well out of Hogwarts and decided on a career in magical zoology. Severus had cornered him during his mother\u2019s birthday party and quietly asked him what kind of rare potions ingredients he was expected to come across during his next trip.</p>\n<p>And that was, as they say, the start of a beautiful friendship. Harry got to travel the world looking for magical creatures, and Severus used and resold any ingredients he brought back. It earned them both a pretty Galleon.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome scales wouldn\u2019t go amiss either,\u201d Severus said, sipping his whiskey. \u201cShed skin if you can find it. Blood is also worth something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo just bring back the whole beast, is what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s dead, certainly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius sent him a postcard from Lisbon, where he and Remus were spending a week to celebrate their wedding anniversary. \u201cHave fun! Don\u2019t get eaten! Remus says to take some pictures he can use in his classes.\u201d Remus, of course, was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts, while Sirius was an Auror. </p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, his best friend Luna stopped by. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she assured him in that peculiar way of hers. \u201cHere, you might want to use these.\u201d She handed him a pair of plastic muggle sunglasses with iridescent lenses. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said with a smile, having long ago learned never to question anything Luna did. He hugged her tightly. If Harry had at all been straight he would have proposed to her in a heartbeat. But alas, he wasn\u2019t, and Luna met and fell in love with Rolf Scamander. And sadly, Rolf didn\u2019t have a gay brother hiding in the closet. </p>\n<p>It took Harry three portkeys to get to Mumbai and from there he could use the floo network to travel within the enormous country. For the very last part of the journey Harry used his broomstick, aided by his trusty invisibility cloak. </p>\n<p>The magical part of the forest was surrounded by a thick layer of wards to keep people, magical and muggle, out. But the wards were decades old and decaying and it took Harry less than an hour to create a small opening for him to slip through. </p>\n<p>He called out in parseltongue and almost immediately a king cobra answered. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe King of Serpents?\u201d the cobra wondered. \u201cYes, I know where he lives. A monocled cobra told me right before I ate him. A friendly chap he was, but a girl\u2019s got to eat. Goes by the name of Voldemort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe monocled cobra?\u201d Harry asked, crouched before the snake.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, silly, the King of Serpents. I never ask my prey their name. I might get attached and then where would I be? Starving, that\u2019s what.\u201d The cobra snickered to herself. \u201cI\u2019ll show you where he lives if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be lovely.\u201d Harry got up and followed the king cobra through the forest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d the snake assured him. \u201cIt gets a bit lonely, you know, when the only creatures you can talk to are the ones you eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it does,\u201d Harry agreed, realizing the cobra had a point. \u201cSo you never talk to Voldemort?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d the cobra said while shaking her head. \u201cA silly old girl like me, chatting with the King of Serpents? I wouldn\u2019t dare. Also, I hear he gets a bit cranky from time to time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Harry swallowed and wiped his suddenly sweaty palms against his jeans. \u201cHow cranky exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hear that every few years he throws a tantrum. He tries to leave, can\u2019t, and destroys some part of the forest. Eats a few deer. One time a tiger, I heard. Imagine eating a whole tiger. The rests of the time he sleeps, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I can work with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>The snake eyed him up and down to asses his size. \u201cI hope you can, wizard, because you\u2019re much smaller than a tiger so he could swallow you whole.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s hand shot to his necklace, which functioned as an emergency portkey. It was still there. Good. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said to assure himself more than the cobra.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d The cobra stopped moving and indicated a large hill in front of them. \u201cBehind that are lots of big caves. That\u2019s where he lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Harry said, meaning it. The cobra had saved him days of searching on his own. \u201cI really appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d the cobra said and waved her tail at him. \u201cGoodbye, wizard. Don\u2019t be prey!\u201d</p>\n<p>It took Harry most of the day to trek through the forest across the hill. Once he was across he pulled his suitcase out of his backpack and climbed inside. The suitcase was Harry\u2019s pride and joy, enchanted by Newt Scamander himself just a month before his death about a decade ago. Harry just counted himself lucky to have gotten to know the man before he passed away.</p>\n<p>Being a parselmouth in an upstanding Gryffindor family had its challenges. The Sorting Hat wanted him in Slytherin for one, but at eleven Harry was still naive enough to believe that being sorted into Gryffindor would earn him his father\u2019s approval. It didn\u2019t, not in the way Harry wanted. </p>\n<p>James Potter just couldn\u2019t accept that his oldest child, his only son, was somehow a parselmouth. </p>\n<p>When Harry had talked to a grass snake in the garden when he was six, his father had first accused Lily of infidelity, which earned him a slap in the face from a fuming Lily. Then he had flooed Professor Dumbledore in a blind panic. </p>\n<p>Dumbledore had looked Harry up and down and assured his parents there was nothing wrong with their son, that sometimes such magic could appear after laying low for generations, and that just because their son displayed a Slytherin trait didn\u2019t mean he was evil.</p>\n<p>Harry wondered what all the fuss was about when all he\u2019d done was discuss the frogs in their pond with a friendly snake. </p>\n<p>Lily had tried very hard to accept him for who he was, and for the most part she succeeded, but his father had since that day treated Harry as just a little bit defective. </p>\n<p>Surprisingly it had been Sirius, his beloved godfather and staunch Gryffindor, who had helped Harry the most by introducing him to Hagrid when he was seven.</p>\n<p>\u201cShow him what you can do, Harry,\u201d Sirius said with an encouraging smile while he conjured a garter snake.</p>\n<p>And Hagrid had clapped his massive hands when Harry talked to the animal about the weather. \u201cJolly good, Harry. Wish I could talk to some of me animals. Dead useful that would be.\u201d</p>\n<p>And a beautiful friendship had been born. Harry credited Hagrid for nursing his burgeoning love for all creatures, and it was through Hagrid that Harry was introduced to Newt Scamander when Hagrid invited Harry over for tea in his first year just as Newt was visiting. Harry had listened in awe and fascination to the soft spoken man, and since that day they kept up a steady correspondence. </p>\n<p>It was Newt that had inspired Harry to become a magical zoologist when the whole world expected him to follow his father into the Auror department. </p>\n<p>And Harry had no regrets. He loved his work, made a nice living thanks to Severus\u2019 business savvy and some of the books Harry had published, and felt he was contributing something by educating the public about all magical creatures great and small.</p>\n<p>The only regret Harry had was that being abroad as much as he was made it hard to have a relationship. He\u2019d dated a few wizards over the years, some more seriously than others. Oliver Wood had been a potentially great future husband, but between both their hectic schedules that relationship had petered out before it ever really got started. </p>\n<p>Blaise Zabini had been a casual relationship with some of the best, most intense sex Harry had ever had. But Blaise wasn\u2019t interested in anything more serious, and Harry needed commitment, so they\u2019d broken it off after almost a year. </p>\n<p>There had been others, but none kept Harry\u2019s attention for long. The forests and oceans of the world called to him, and Harry always answered. </p>\n<p>Besides, Luna assured him he\u2019d find someone eventually who would accept him and his career, and Luna Lovegood was rarely wrong about anything. </p>\n<p>Harry made himself a simple dinner of bacon sandwiches with some scrambled eggs on the side in the small kitchen in his suitcase. After eating he took a cup of tea to bed with him and read a zoological journal about a colleague\u2019s travels to meet a thunderbird until his eyes drooped shut. </p>\n<p>The next day Harry took a refreshing shower, had some porridge and a strong cup of coffee for breakfast and packed up his suitcase in his backpack. </p>\n<p>It was only another two miles or so until the mouth of the cave. The entrance was enormous, easily as big as the great hall at Hogwarts. Harry walked to the middle of the entrance, inhaled a deep breath and called out in parseltongue. </p>\n<p>\u201cGreetings, King of Serpents. I come in peace.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something moved in the shadows deeper inside the cave. \u201cListen, krait, I told you to bugger off. I have no interest in your schemes.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was spoken in perfect parseltongue, at once familiar but with an other-worldly quality to it. </p>\n<p>Harry cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not a krait. I\u2019m a wizard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Massive dark-green coils erupted from the shadows, and on instinct Harry squeezed his eyes shut and clenched his fingers around his emergency portkey. </p>\n<p>Scales ground against the stone as something massive came closer and closer until it encircled him. Harry heard the beast move and breathe, but he kept his eyes shut tightly, his breath caught in his throat while sweat dripped down his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d the basilisk said as Harry heard his head stop in front of him. \u201cThat took you long enough. I\u2019ve only been waiting for decades.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was so shocked and flabbergasted by that response he accidentally opened his eyes and stared right into a pair of bright yellow orbs. Shrieking, Harry clapped both hands over his face, emergency portkey quickly forgotten. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot a very bright one, are you,\u201d the basilisk said in a quite frankly snooty tone. \u201cAh well, beggars can\u2019t be choosers. You can open your eyes. Parselmouths are immune to a basilisk\u2019s gaze.\u201d</p>\n<p>Very, very slowly, Harry lowered his hands and looked at the basilisk. He was enormous, easily sixty feet long with a head that indeed could swallow Harry whole should it desire to. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Harry said, so awed by talking to an actual basilisk he had no clue what else to say.</p>\n<p>The basilisk rolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cReally not a bright one. What is your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter. And you are Voldemort, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>The basilisk gave what could only be described as an embarrassed shrug. \u201cI made the mistake of telling a Russell\u2019s viper that name when I first arrived here and it stuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry got more and more confused by the minute. \u201cSo Voldemort is not your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>The basilisk moved closer until they were almost nose to nose. \u201cMy name is Tom Riddle and I need your help to turn me back into a wizard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry gaped at the basilisk, mouth hanging open. He knew he must look the fool but he was too shocked to care. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow thick are you?\u201d the basilisk \u2013 Tom! \u2013 asked him. \u201cI\u2019m a wizard. I need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I got that part. Just...how did this happen? Is it an animagus transfiguration gone wrong? I\u2019m an animagus, so I might be able to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The basilisk \u2013 Tom \u2013 shook his massive head. \u201cI\u2019m an animagus as well, but I became one years before this happened and my form is not a basilisk.\u201d Tom looked away from Harry. \u201cI performed a ritual, but...I was betrayed. The sorceress who gave me the ritual knew this would happen. She wanted this to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of ritual? I\u2019m really not well-versed in rituals, to be honest.\u201d Harry shrugged helplessly. Of course he wanted to help this wizard, but his expertise was magical creatures, not magical catastrophes.</p>\n<p>Tom ducked his head, his coils tightening for a second. \u201cIt was a ritual of longevity. Do the ritual, have a guaranteed 1000-year-long lifespan, that sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t help himself. He snorted. \u201cSo the ritual did work. Basilisks do live that long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Tom snapped. \u201cI had realized that a time or two or five hundred since I got stuck like this. Wait, what year is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s 2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom visibly recoiled, his yellow eyes widening. \u201cIt\u2019s 2013? I knew some decades had passed but I thought it might be the eighties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you get stuck like this then?\u201d Harry asked, his heart aching for this guy. No wonder he got cranky sometimes and tore up the forest. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI was born December 31st, 1926. I performed the ritual on midsummer\u2019s eve, 1953,\u201d Tom whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. You have been stuck here for a long time.\u201d Harry considered the situation and knew at once what to do. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cAre you mad? I\u2019m a basilisk, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. I go beyond this forest and the whole world will hunt me down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s smile was wide as he slipped off his backpack and pulled out his suitcase. \u201cOh mate, the world won\u2019t know you\u2019re with me.\u201d He placed the suitcase on the floor and flipped open the lid. \u201cJust follow me. You\u2019ll fit, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Harry quickly climbed down the stairs into the main area of the suitcase. Newt had charmed it, much like his own suitcase, to have a main holding area with many habitats bordering it, with a small apartment off to the side. Harry heard scales sliding above him and he watched quietly as Tom lowered the bulk of his body inside the holding area, forked tongue flicking in and out of his mouth. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is quite impressive,\u201d Tom said, carefully sliding along the floor as he checked out all the different habitats. </p>\n<p>\u201cPlenty of space for you to move around in until we can reverse the ritual.\u201d Harry crossed his arms, leaning his hip against a support beam as he watched Tom get familiar with the place. \u201cI don\u2019t have any animals with me now. My owl, Hedwig, always travelled with me but she died a few years ago. I use the habitats for sick creatures or ones that need relocating. I\u2019m a magical zoologist,\u201d he added, not sure if he\u2019d told Tom that yet or not. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a Gryffindor,\u201d Tom said with a sigh as he poked his head inside Harry\u2019s living quarters where Harry kept a Gryffindor flag above the sofa. \u201cOf course you had to be a Gryffindor, blundering your way inside a basilisk\u2019s lair as you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Gryffindor?\u201d Harry asked with a grin and then realized something. \u201cWait, are you British? Did you go to Hogwarts?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom gave him a disbelieving look before rolling his eyes. \u201cBorn and raised in London. I\u2019m a Slytherin. Prefect. Head boy, even. I had the highest NEWTs score, at least until then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckled. \u201cYou sound like the boy my friend Hermione complained about after she went through Hogwarts\u2019 student records. She wanted to be the best and she was determined to beat your scores but she couldn\u2019t quite manage it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tom said with a smug look. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I left some kind of legacy behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Harry gestured around the space. \u201cThis way we can take our time getting you back to yourself, and in the meantime you get out of the forest and I can do my job.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom stared at him for a moment. \u201cI suppose that is acceptable. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got anything better to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Harry said, but he sobered after a moment of excitement. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll be careful with your gaze. I might be immune but the rest of the world isn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can shield my gaze with my third eyelid temporarily.\u201d Tom demonstrated by raising an opaque lid over his bright yellow eyes. \u201cBut perhaps it\u2019s wise to not let anyone else down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cThe suitcase is warded. No one can enter without my express invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. There is one thing left to do.\u201d And with that, Tom raised himself up and slid out of the suitcase. Harry jumped up the ladder and followed him out. Tom led him deeper inside the cave to a part where it was almost too dark to see. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to bring this for me.\u201d Tom nudged his nose against a small rocky ledge. </p>\n<p>Harry leaned closer to see what was on it. \u201cIs that your wand?\u201d he asked after he managed to identify the object in the near darkness.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. If you could grab that for me I would be much obliged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry did and the moment his fingers closed around the pale wood an almost familiar warmth shot up his arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s it made of? It feels almost like my own wand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYew and phoenix feather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Harry reached for the holster in his sleeve and pulled out his own wand. \u201cHolly and phoenix feather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMight be from the same phoenix if they are that similar,\u201d Tom suggested.</p>\n<p>\u201cMight be,\u201d Harry agreed. He placed both wands inside the holster. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of it until you can hold it again, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom was quiet for a moment before he whispered, \u201cThank you. That wand is what has kept me sane over the years. Knowing it was there, that it was mine, that I was a wizard, it kept me from giving up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry placed a hand on Tom\u2019s scaly side in comfort. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you sorted out, Tom. I know a lot of brilliant people. They\u2019ll help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom nodded his head and without saying anything else he slid back to the suitcase. Harry followed him with a sense of purpose brewing in his chest. He would help Tom get back to himself and in the meantime he had a companion for his travels.</p>\n<p>Before Harry climbed down in the suitcase he aimed his wand at the cave. \u201cAccio shed basilisk skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three long almost translucent skins came flying towards him. One, the oldest, was too far gone to be of any use, but the other two were still in good shape. Harry folded them with a wave of his wand and ignored Tom\u2019s amused look as he carefully stored them in an empty trunk.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rent doesn\u2019t pay itself,\u201d Harry said, closing the trunk. \u201cI\u2019ve got to sell things I find to fund this operation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should milk some of my venom. That should earn you a nice pile of Galleons.\u201d Tom briefly opened his mouth to show off his enormous fangs. \u201cIf you dare,\u201d he added with a hissed laugh. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you let me I\u2019ll dare.\u201d Harry offered him his cockiest grin. \u201cGryffindor, remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could I forget. Though what the Sorting Hat was thinking in placing a parselmouth in Gryffindor, I\u2019ll never understand.\u201d Tom stretched his coils out before getting more comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it hadn\u2019t seen a parselmouth in a long time,\u201d Harry offered. \u201cDumbledore told me I was the first parselmouth in Britain in centuries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom reared his head up with a terrifying hiss. \u201cDumbledore is full of shit. I\u2019m a parselmouth, which I told him when he came to give me my letter when I was eleven. He never trusted me afterwards. And now he\u2019s erasing my existence altogether.\u201d Tom\u2019s eyes positively glowed as he glared at Harry.</p>\n<p>Not knowing how to respond to that, but slightly cowed in the face of a basilisk\u2019s fury, former human or not, Harry lowered his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom seemed to deflate slightly. \u201cI realize it\u2019s not your fault. It just angers me beyond belief that Dumbledore would do such a thing. That man has never given me a fair chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I guess asking Dumbledore for help is out of the question? Because he\u2019s at the top of my list to go to, if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d Harry said carefully.</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s eyes started glowing again. \u201cThat man is still alive? And yes, going to him is definitely out of the question. I\u2019d rather remain this way than ask him for anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, point made,\u201d Harry said, meanwhile wondering what the hell Dumbledore had done to this man to make him hate the headmaster that much. To be honest, Harry had never had much to do with Dumbledore. His parents were friendly with him, his dad had business with him through his work from time to time, and his mother, who worked as a healer in St Mungo\u2019s, had called upon the headmaster for his expertise in transfiguration in a few difficult cases. But Harry himself, especially after he became a zoologist had never garnered much of the headmaster\u2019s attention. Then again, he\u2019d never been an exceptional student outside his interest in creatures and his talent on a broom.</p>\n<p>Harry had figured out years ago, after a few nights drinking wine or whiskey with Severus and listening to some of his stories about his time at Hogwarts, that Dumbledore was the kind of man who surrounded himself with talented people who could solve his problems for him. Severus wasn\u2019t overly fond of the man for his abysmal treatment of Slytherins, and Blaise had always had lots to complain about the headmaster as well, and Harry realized Tom might very well have similar experiences as those two when it came to the headmaster and Slytherins.</p>\n<p>Best to respect his grievances and find help elsewhere. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a sandwich. Do you need to eat?\u201d Harry moved inside his small apartment, amused when Tom stuck his head inside the door to see what he was doing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I ate two deer just the other week. I don\u2019t require much sustenance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me know when you get hungry. There\u2019s plenty of deer and wild boar in the world.\u201d Harry prepared himself a simple roast beef sandwich and a cup of tea and flopped down on the sofa to eat it. </p>\n<p>Tom flicked his tongue in and out. \u201cI miss tea,\u201d he sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I would, too,\u201d Harry said between bites. \u201cWhat possessed you to do such a ritual in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStupidity,\u201d Tom replied with a bitter laugh. \u201cArrogance. Ambition. Immortality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImmortality? Really? That sounds a bit...much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have, since being stuck like this for sixty years, come to the conclusion that immortality is overrated, yes.\u201d Tom\u2019s gaze was miles away. \u201cI wonder if this was the sorceress\u2019 goal when she gave me the ritual. I\u2019d spent so many years trying to lose my humanity and yet, now I would do almost anything to be human again.\u201d And with that Tom pulled his head back and disappeared into the holding area, leaving a baffled Harry behind.</p>\n<p>Harry left Tom alone for an hour while he stretched his legs out on the couch and wrote in his journal. If there was something that Newt had taught him, it was to take lots of notes, then some more notes, and just when you thought you had enough, you added a few extra just to be safe.</p>\n<p>After logging the highlights of his adventure so far, Harry stuck the journal in the back pocket of his jeans and went in search for Tom.</p>\n<p>He found the basilisk swimming in the mountain lake in the temperate habitat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little cold?\u201d Harry called out as he stood on the shore, water lapping at his shoes. \u201cThere\u2019s also a big lake in the tropical habitat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom swirled around in the water a few times and swam towards him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said as he slid on land beside Harry. \u201cBasilisks can tolerate much colder temperatures than most other reptiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry reached for his journal and dutifully wrote that titbit of information down.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Tom said with a little sigh. \u201cI love this view.\u201d He nodded his head at the snow-capped mountains in the distance. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of trees to last me a very long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry quirked a smile at that. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Tom said in mock sympathy. \u201cDid it hurt a lot?\u201d</p>\n<p>Staring at the enormous basilisk beside him, Harry wasn\u2019t sure how to react at first. He settled for rolling his eyes, though he couldn\u2019t hold back a grin. \u201cHow old were you again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOlder than you.\u201d Tom seemed to shake himself a little. \u201cBut go on. Share your thoughts with the group.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin, this guy. Harry snickered quietly. \u201cWhen we get you turned back into yourself, you\u2019ll need to start over, right? I\u2019m assuming here you don\u2019t have wealthy relatives or a fat vault at Gringott\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou assume right. I grew up a penniless orphan, and even though I worked after Hogwarts and managed to save a small amount, taking 60 years worth of inflation into account that amount would barely buy you a set of robes nowadays.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Harry nodded in agreement. \u201cMy business partner and I sell rare ingredients, among other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom seemed to cotton on where this was going. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a living, breathing treasure trove.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething like that, yes. You go in with us, we sell your venom and shed skins and split the profits three-way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom tilted his head and narrowed his eyes. \u201cNo, we split 50-50. I take half, and how you divvy up your half is up to you. Share with your partner or not, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d Harry said with a huge grin. Half of the proceeds of selling basilisk products was more than enough to add a small fortune to both his and Severus\u2019 vaults.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019d best get milking, hadn\u2019t you, Harry.\u201d Tom grinned in a way that showed off his fangs. </p>\n<p>Harry stared, reminded himself he was a Gryffindor, turned on his heels and marched back to the holding area. He called out over his shoulder, \u201cCome on then. I promise I\u2019ll be gentle. I\u2019m quite adapt at...milking other wizards. Never have any complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom inhaled a sharp breath and shot forward to catch up with him. \u201cWas that flirting, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d Harry asked, deeply amused by Tom\u2019s overly dramatic response.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t speak Gryffindor, so no, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Tom said with an almost bashful tilt of his head. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019ve only just met and you are being very forward with my person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, you managed to get all of that out with a straight face. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t stop grinning as he collected a pair of galvanized buckets and hit them with the most abrasive cleaning charm he knew. </p>\n<p>\u201cMission accomplished,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBeing a sixty foot basilisk wasn\u2019t impressive enough, apparently. It\u2019s my conversation skills that were ultimately needed to truly impress.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laughing, Harry found a stretch of old canvas. He cut out two big squares and fixed them over the top of the buckets so Tom would have something to bite down on that would create enough pressure to release some venom.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously though, do you have any idea how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve had some reasonably intelligent conversation?\u201d Tom mused as he watched Harry work. </p>\n<p>\u201cSixty years?\u201d Harry guessed as he pulled a pair of dragon-hide gloves out of a nearby trunk.</p>\n<p>\u201cSixty years,\u201d Tom agreed sagely. \u201cSo excuse me if I\u2019m feeling a little bit starved for socialization.\u201d He shook his big head in obvious bewilderment. \u201cWhich is the height of irony because for my entire life, before I came here, I prided myself on being a loner, on not needing anyone but myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you went through would change anyone.\u201d Harry pulled open a few other trunks but couldn\u2019t find a pair of protective goggles. He suspected the orphaned litter of nifflers he\u2019d raised the previous spring had done away with them. And then he remembered. He summoned his backpack, pulled out the ridiculous pair of sunglasses Luna had given him and slid them on. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask,\u201d Tom said. Harry had no idea basilisks could look that unimpressed. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d </p>\n<p>The procedure was fairly simple. Tom opened his mouth wide, Harry levitated the two buckets into place below the fangs, and Tom bit down. Thick, yellow venom squirted from the fangs, filling the buckets almost three quarters full. </p>\n<p>\u201cSweet baby hippogriff,\u201d Harry said as he carefully levitated the buckets to the floor and removed the canvas. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of venom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d Tom raised his head and peered over Harry\u2019s shoulder at the buckets. \u201cJust give me a week and I\u2019ll have that amount again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed and turned to stare at Tom. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be rich.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine it will take at least a few weeks to find a way to reverse the ritual, so yes, we\u2019re going to be very rich,\u201d Tom said with what passed as a huge grin on a basilisk.</p>\n<p>Harry transfigured lids out of the canvas and spelled them on the buckets so not a drop would be wasted. One bucket for Tom, and one bucket for Severus and himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to stay here, is there?\u201d Harry asked after he put the buckets away in a locked cupboard. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to leave this forest for sixty years. I\u2019m beyond ready to go.\u201d Tom gave Harry an inquiring look. \u201cThe wards around the forest won\u2019t let me through, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose wards are old and poorly maintained. I was able to squeeze my way through in under an hour. If you stay in here I believe I can take you through without a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then,\u201d Tom said with no small amount of excitement in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll be over there, swimming, while you rescue me like I\u2019m a princess locked in a tower, Gryffindor hero that you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snorted with laughter. \u201cSome princess you are, you scaly worm. More like the monster that\u2019s guarding some innocent maiden.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom gasped in mock offense, threw his head to the side in a very dramatic fashion and then slithered towards the mountain lake. Halfway there, he stopped, turned around and called, \u201cAnd what does that say about you, brave Gryffindor hero, that you are rescuing me?\u201d And then he was off again and within seconds he disappeared beneath the gentle waves of the lake.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, deeply amused by his new friend\u2019s antics. Tom had so far shown him he was capable of great fury, but also of silly flirtations, and Harry liked what he\u2019d seen of him so far. He couldn\u2019t wait to get to know him better, first as a basilisk and hopefully soon as a man.</p>\n<p>Harry left Tom to the lake, packed up the suitcase and mounted his broom. It took only an hour of flying close to the forest canopy, startling various birds and some screeching monkeys, to get across the hill, and then another half hour to get to the ward line. Harry dismounted and pulled out his wand to reopen the crack in the wards so they could slip through.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hello again,\u201d a familiar voice said behind him. \u201cStill alive, I see. Did you meet him? What was he like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi there,\u201d Harry said to the king cobra who had helped him the previous day. \u201cYes, I met him. And he\u2019s a wizard stuck as a basilisk.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cobra flared her hood a little. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a little disappointing. The King of Serpents, a wizard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps to you,\u201d Harry said as he waved his wand at the wards in a repeating pattern. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to help him become a wizard again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking him with you?\u201d the cobra guessed. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise? I heard he ate a whole village of people once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry whipped his head around. \u201cHe what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen he first came here, long before my time, he destroyed an entire village. That\u2019s why the wizards came to put up the magic lines.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry said, but then didn\u2019t know what else to say. He could see it, though. Tom, recently betrayed and trapped in a basilisk\u2019s body, his yellow eyes glowing as he took his anger and fear out on a nearby town. He didn\u2019t agree with it, but he could understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill want to save him?\u201d the cobra asked with a curious tilt of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, and meant it. \u201cNo one deserves this. Thanks again for your help.\u201d And with one final smile at the cobra he slipped through the wards, mounted his broom and took off into the sky.</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t look back. If he had, he would have seen a woman standing in place of the king cobra. Tall and black of skin with four arms and wearing a necklace comprised of human heads. When she spoke, her voice echoed with destiny. \u201cThe one once destined to kill you will be the one to save you. You will hear him as he speaks your tongue. You will see him as he will find you. You will love him as if your souls were bound. Only he can restore you, oh great King of Serpents.\u201d</p>\n<p>And she was gone. </p>\n<p>Harry travelled as quickly as he could back to the UK, not wanting to risk anyone finding out he was smuggling one of the deadliest creatures known to wizard-kind across international borders. Once home in his cottage in Hogsmeade, Harry immediately sent a Patronus to Severus even though it was already evening. His translucent stag, once a point of pride when he was still trying to win his father\u2019s affections, only annoyed him these days. Still, it darted dutifully away and only ten minutes later a translucent bear burst through the wall, informing him he was welcome to stop by. </p>\n<p>Gathering the trunk with the shed skins and the buckets with venom, Harry said goodbye to Tom, who was sunbathing in the desert habitat, and set out into the village.</p>\n<p>Severus also owned a cottage in Hogsmeade, though one much larger than Harry\u2019s, with its own potions labs, and on the opposite side of town. It was still only a short walk, since the village wasn\u2019t very big. </p>\n<p>Severus opened the door and ushered him inside and towards the laboratories. \u201cYou were successful?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Harry said with a grin, just as the door to his right opened and Hilde stuck her head out, her blond ponytail in complete disarray. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi Harry, good to see you. There is tea and strudel in the kitchen, help yourself. I have three brews on, so I have to go.\u201d And she quickly disappeared behind the door again. Harry was used to her behaviour so he didn\u2019t blink an eye.</p>\n<p>Severus had married a German witch ten years his junior named Hilde Baumgarten. She was a passionate potioneer, having invented and marketed three potions before she even finished Durmstrang. She was also the most vicious chess-player Harry had ever met. After Harry introduced them, even Ron had been intimidated by some of her strategies, and that was saying something.</p>\n<p>Severus adored her, not in the least because she was the mother of his children.</p>\n<p>It was one of life\u2019s little ironies that one of the most intimidating men Harry had ever met, Severus Snape, had fathered the world\u2019s most adorable six-year-old twin girls. Severus doted on them with all the love and dedication of a mother bear and woe to anyone who so much as looked at them funny. </p>\n<p>Naturally, Harry was the proud godfather, while Hyacinth was their godmother. </p>\n<p>Harry followed Severus inside the lab on the left, because as Hilde always said to anyone who would listen: \u201cSeparate labs, happy marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus stared at the buckets once Harry removed the lids, and then in a rare show of affection he threw his arm around Harry\u2019s shoulders and gave him a brief squeeze. \u201cThat is our retirement right there,\u201d Severus said with as big of a smile as Harry had ever seen on his face. \u201cBoth of our retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u2019 Harry said, flipping open the trunk and pulling at one of the skins to spread it out a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cRetirement and a very nice family vacation,\u201d Severus said, bending down to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs many as you like,\u201d Harry said with a huge grin. \u201cThere is a lot more where that came from.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus glanced at him for a second before going back to examining the skins. Then he stood up abruptly and glared at Harry, apparently having just remembered he was dealing with a Gryffindor.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you bring the beast back with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr...no?\u201d Harry tried, quite unsuccessfully, to lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs. It. Dead?\u201d Severus loomed over him. How he managed this, Harry had no idea, since they were the same height. </p>\n<p>\u201cDefine dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI define dead as Not. Being. Alive.\u201d Severus seemed to suddenly notice the backpack at Harry\u2019s feet and before Harry knew it there was a hand around his throat that started squeezing. \u201cAre you telling me, Potter, that you brought a basilisk inside the house my children are sleeping in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry coughed and tried to swallow. \u201cNot a basilisk,\u201d he gasped. \u201cNot really. A wizard. Stuck as basilisk. Botched ritual.\u201d </p>\n<p>Severus released him and Harry desperately conjured a glass of cold water to soothe his aching throat. He gulped it down in two seconds flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cA wizard stuck as a basilisk, you say? And how much is he willing to donate before you help him get unstuck? Because I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why you brought him back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, Slytherins and their pragmatism. You had to love them. \u201cPlenty,\u201d Harry rasped and cleared his throat. \u201cHe wants half though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Severus eyed the buckets of venom. \u201cIf he gives us a few more of those I see no problem with that.\u201d Then he rounded on Harry. \u201cI still want him out of my house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Harry conceded. He\u2019d only brought the suitcase because he was paranoid about leaving it alone in his home. What if it got stolen with Tom inside? \u201cDo you have any idea how to get Tom unstuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTom Riddle. The basilisk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus\u2019 glare was full of condescension. \u201cHarry, you have unlimited access to perhaps the finest magical library outside of Hogwarts. Go and do your homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Harry sighed. He\u2019d hoped that somehow Severus would have the cure to Tom\u2019s situation handy on a silver platter, but alas, it seemed he was going to have to do this the complicated way. \u201cI\u2019ll floo Reggie.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Sirius Black decided to elope with his half-blood werewolf lover, exactly no one was surprised. A few old biddies spent an afternoon or two sipping tea and decrying today\u2019s youth, but that was about all the fuss it caused. Ever since Sirius was sorted into Gryffindor he had let the world know, loudly and repeatedly, that he was nothing like the rest of his conservative, blood-prejudiced family, and that he couldn\u2019t care less of what society expected of him.</p>\n<p>Sirius was quietly disinherited and his younger brother Regulus was made heir, and that was that. </p>\n<p>But when three years later Regulus Black announced that he was marrying a man, all hell broke loose. Quiet, studious Regulus, the perfect pureblood son was expected to marry a pureblood witch of good upbringing and produce copious amounts of pureblood children. </p>\n<p>The only good thing about Regulus\u2019 intended was that he was a pureblood, but he was neither a witch nor capable of giving Regulus heirs. </p>\n<p>Bartemius Crouch Jr was easily as quiet as Regulus and far more studious. A Ravenclaw, he met Regulus in the Hogwarts library during their fifth year when Regulus looked about ready to burst into tears over a particularly nasty arithmancy problem. Bartemius, who had admired the Slytherin from afar for a while, kindly asked him if he needed help. Regulus accepted the offer and before the year was over they were madly in love and joined at the hip. </p>\n<p>Walburga threatened everything from disinheritance to the Unforgivables. Every single high society luncheon and ball was filled with nothing but gossip of this scandal of the year, nay, the decade. Pollux Black, Walburga\u2019s father, got involved, publically accusing Barty of dosing his grandson with love potions. Barty Crouch Sr wasn\u2019t about to take such an insult to his family lying down and had the entire Auror corps raid Pollux\u2019 family mansion looking for dark artefacts after conveniently receiving an anonymous tip. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Regulus kept his chin up and his mouth shut and his hand firmly holding on to Barty\u2019s. No matter how anyone begged, pleaded, bribed or threatened, Regulus would not be dissuaded. </p>\n<p>It was Arcturus Black, still head of the family despite his advanced age, that had to step in to keep the peace in his family, and indeed in the rest of British wizarding society. He declared that Regulus could marry who he wanted and that he would remain heir to the family and could simply appoint someone else in the Black family as his heir apparent.</p>\n<p>On the day of Regulus\u2019 wedding, Sirius showed up uninvited, hugged his little brother and told him he\u2019d never been more proud of him. And thus the rift that Walburga had spent years driving between her sons was fixed once and for all.</p>\n<p>And that was how Harry and Hyacinth grew up with an Uncle Reggie and Uncle Barty added to their extended family.</p>\n<p>After having sworn Severus to secrecy, Harry had gone home and flooed Regulus to ask him if he could stop by the next day. Regulus agreed and was waiting for him when Harry tumbled out of the fireplace the next morning. </p>\n<p>\u201cUncle Reggie!\u201d Harry cried out in his best child-like voice. </p>\n<p>Regulus sighed. \u201cHow often do I have to tell you to call me Regulus? You\u2019re a grown man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently one more time,\u201d Harry told him with a shit-eating grin, and then just to rub it in he added, \u201cIs Bartemius home? I could use his advice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little shit,\u201d Regulus muttered and then turned to call up the stairs. \u201cBarty! The zookeeper\u2019s here, probably freeloading again!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry bent over laughing as Barty came thundering down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Harry. I heard you went to India to meet a basilisk. Are you back already?\u201d Barty gave Harry a pat on the shoulder and then followed his husband into the drawing room. Regulus\u2019 ancient house-elf Kreacher served them tea while Harry got comfortable on the sofa. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I need your library, and your expertise, Barty, to help the basilisk,\u201d Harry said. Barty was a Rune and Ward Master and knew a heck of a lot more than Harry did about rituals. In fact, Barty was the kind of person who knew a heck of a lot about most things, and if he didn\u2019t then he needed two hours in Reggie\u2019s family library and he\u2019d be completely informed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp the basilisk?\u201d Regulus asked with a frown. \u201cWhat on earth does a basilisk need help for?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cA basilisk that is actually a wizard who got stuck after a botched ritual,\u201d Harry explained and took a sip of his tea and watched shock flicker across Barty\u2019s and Regulus\u2019 faces. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell did this wizard manage that? What kind of ritual even was it?\u201d Barty wanted to know, ever the Ravenclaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is this wizard? What\u2019s his name?\u201d Regulus demanded, ever the pureblood socialite no matter his slightly more progressive leanings.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe got the ritual from a local sorceress. I don\u2019t know more than that yet. And his name is Tom Riddle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus stiffened and very carefully sat his cup and saucer down on the coffee table. \u201cAnd did Mr Riddle have another name by any chance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked in confusion. \u201cEr...oh, some of the snakes there called him Voldemort, but Tom seemed a bit embarrassed by that name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he now,\u201d Regulus said with the kind of forced calm that made the hair on the back of Harry\u2019s neck stand up. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Barty asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know of him.\u201d Regulus inhaled a deep, controlled breath, his grey eyes as sharp as shards of ice. \u201cA few years before his death, my father told me about him when they had Riddle declared legally dead. They hadn\u2019t heard from him in twenty five years and they wanted access to his vault to get back some of the priceless tomes and artefacts several members of prominent families had gifted him.\u201d Regulus picked up his cup again and took a careful sip. \u201cThe way my father told it, Riddle was the second coming of Merlin, if Merlin was a blood-prejudiced killer hell-bent on world domination.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed against his suddenly dry throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cRiddle was a poor half-blood, but a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin and a parselmouth. He was also one of the smartest students to ever attend Hogwarts, and more powerful than most of his Slytherin year mates combined. He also really enjoyed doling out the cruciatus curse if any Slytherin did something to displease him. All that, combined with his ambition to rule the wizarding world while permanently getting rid of muggleborns made it so my father and many others of his standing followed a half-blood without question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin\u2019s saggy pants,\u201d Barty muttered. \u201cWhy have we never heard of this guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happens in the Slytherin common room stays in the Slytherin common room. And to the outside, Riddle was a model student. Humble, helpful, a prefect and Head boy. My father said Riddle was one of the greatest actors he\u2019d ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut...\u201d Harry cleared his throat, desperately looking for a way to explain this that didn\u2019t paint the Tom he knew as a monster. Yet no words came to him that could.</p>\n<p>\u201cRiddle was responsible for at least one student death. My father didn\u2019t know the details, but he knew Riddle did it and framed another student. He also knew Riddle murdered his muggle father and grandparents. Again, no details, but Riddle framed it on someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gulped down the last of his tea and wiped a hand across his sweaty brow. \u201cIt\u2019s been sixty years, though,\u201d he argued weakly. \u201cPeople change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey do,\u201d Regulus agreed with the same tight control he\u2019d been holding onto for minutes now. \u201cBut I believe, Harry, that you had best make sure you are not simply turning one monster into another before you visit our library.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry whispered, having nothing else to say to that.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at the bright side,\u201d Barty said with forced cheer, \u201cYou\u2019ll get to travel to India again. Such a beautiful country with amazing food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently the look Harry gave them was very telling because Barty gasped as Regulus raised his eyebrows. Then both of them noticed the backpack at Harry\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Harry,\u201d Regulus snapped, his calm finally broken, \u201cGet that thing out of my house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Harry muttered, grabbing his backpack and standing up.</p>\n<p>Regulus got to his feet as well. \u201cOnce you have reached a well-thought out and careful conclusion about the fate of your new friend, I will gladly listen to your arguments and decide to grant you access or not. But until that time, I\u2019m afraid the library is closed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded in understanding. He himself was very confused and even a little bit hurt about all he\u2019d just learned. He needed to talk to Tom. He needed to know the truth about the other man.</p>\n<p>Barty jumped up from his leather chair and grabbed Harry by the elbow. \u201cI\u2019ll see you out, Harry.\u201d He guided Harry to the front door, looked over his shoulder to make sure Reggie was still in the drawing room, and then he leaned close to Harry. \u201cGet me that ritual. Any details you can find. Send me an owl and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d He gave Harry a cheeky wink and opened the door for him.</p>\n<p>Ah, Ravenclaws. The thirst for knowledge trumped everything else. </p>\n<p>Harry found a secluded spot around the corner of Grimmauld Place and apparated to the doorstep of his cottage. Once inside he dropped down on the couch and ran both hands across his face. He did not look forward to the conversation he would be having, but he was a Gryffindor and talk to Tom he would no matter how unpleasant. </p>\n<p>He pulled the suitcase from his backpack, flipped the lid open and climbed inside, his heart slowly sinking towards his stomach. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re back soon,\u201d Tom said as he came sliding out of the desert habitat. \u201cDid you get to visit that library you mentioned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Black family library,\u201d Harry said softly.</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s yellow eyes widened. \u201cYou have access to the Black family library?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, the current Head of the Black family is part of my extended family.\u201d Harry summoned a wooden kitchen chair from his living quarters. He needed to sit down because his knees were trembling. \u201cTell me, Tom. Do you know Orion Black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I went to Hogwarts with him. We were dorm mates,\u201d Tom said pleasantly, still not cottoning on to Harry\u2019s growing distress \u201cIs he still alive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he died quite a few years ago, but before he did he mentioned you to his son when they were having you declared legally dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom let out an annoyed hiss and curled his large body around itself. \u201cI was afraid they would do that. Probably wanted their books back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. \u201cWorld domination, Tom? Blood prejudice? The cruciatus curse?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom stopped moving and he gave Harry a very careful, even a calculating look. \u201cHarry, I can explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain?\u201d Harry jumped up from his chair. \u201cHow do you explain killing a student?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was an accident, I swear, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when you killed your father and grandparents, was that an accident as well?\u201d Harry balled his hands into fists as he glared at the basilisk. </p>\n<p>Tom shot forward until his nose nearly touched Harry\u2019s chest. \u201cThey deserved it! They were living in the lap of luxury while they left me to rot in a muggle orphanage. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to grow up in an orphanage during the Great Depression? During World War 2? Surrounded by ignorant muggles who punish you every time you accidentally perform magic? Do you, Harry?\u201d He waited a moment but Harry had no response. \u201cUntil you do, you do not get to judge me for this. Judge me for everything else, but killing those monsters is something I will never regret.\u201d Tom inhaled a deep breath, his scaly side heaving as he moved back a bit. </p>\n<p>Harry looked down at his shoes for a moment. \u201cFine, I won\u2019t judge you for that because you\u2019re right. I have no idea what your childhood was like. But everything else, Tom? Explain everything else to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain?\u201d Tom snorted, shaking his head. \u201cI was young and stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do better than that,\u201d Harry snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain it to you in just a few words besides that. I was far too clever for my own good and far too ambitious. But the real truth is, that I was far too scared. I had learned long ago in that fucking orphanage that the best way to keep from being hurt was to strike first.\u201d Tom curled up tightly, his coils winding over each other. \u201cWhen I got to Hogwarts and was sorted into Slytherin as a suspected muggleborn, I very quickly learned that the same principles applied in the wizarding world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed, his mind reeling. Tom sounded so reasonable, so likable, so genuine. But Orion Black had called him a great actor, hadn\u2019t he? \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d he said honestly. </p>\n<p>Looking at him with wide eyes, Tom crept a little closer. \u201cPlease let me explain myself to you, Harry. Please give me a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I believe a word you say,\u201d Harry whispered. Tom released a wounded little hiss and tried to follow Harry to the ladder but Harry stopped him with a gesture. \u201cI need to think about this, Tom. Alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom nodded, looking absolutely despondent. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you anything right now.\u201d And with that Harry climbed the ladder out of the suitcase. Tom didn\u2019t follow.</p>\n<p>Mind in turmoil and heart aching, Harry made himself a strong cup of tea. He settled on the couch and stared at the opposite wall for a while. This was not at all what he\u2019d been expecting when he\u2019d decided to help Tom change back to his old self. He\u2019d expected hours of research, not having to judge if a fellow human being was even worthy of being a human.</p>\n<p>How had Reggie put it? He might be changing one monster into another. </p>\n<p>Then again, people did change, didn\u2019t they? The problem was, Harry had no idea if what Tom was telling him was even true. Tom could tell him all sorts of pleasant things, meanwhile plotting murder and mayhem. How was Harry to know?</p>\n<p>The facts didn\u2019t lie. Tom had murdered people. His own father. Sure, he had reasons to hate the man, but that wasn\u2019t a justified reason to kill him, was it?</p>\n<p>A knock sounded on the front door. With a sigh, Harry got up, determined to send away whoever it was. He really wasn\u2019t in the mood for company right now. </p>\n<p>Harry opened the door and came face to face with Blaise. Arms loosely crossed, shoulder leaning against the doorpost, Blaise struck a carefully constructed, carefree pose. </p>\n<p>\u201cHello, my dear,\u201d Blaise said with a little smirk. \u201cI heard you got yourself a pet basilisk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grabbed Blaise\u2019s wrist and yanked the man inside, quickly shutting the door. \u201cWho told you this? Severus? Reggie? If this gets out, if the ministry finds out I have \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, Harry dearest,\u201d Blaise said with the kind of smug smile that drove Harry to contemplate murder. \u201cI merely heard you were looking for a basilisk in India and, knowing you, I drew a few logical conclusions.\u201d Leaning over, Blaise gave him a quick kiss on the lips. \u201cAnd you, my sweet Gryffindor child, have just confirmed all I needed to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared in disbelief. He probably should be surprised, but he\u2019d been hanging around Slytherins in general and Blaise specifically long enough to know how cunning they could truly be. He sighed, shook his head and marched back to the couch. Throwing himself on it, he dropped his head back and stared up at the ceiling. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like you have all of the world\u2019s problems resting on your shoulders.\u201d Blaise moved around Harry\u2019s living room towards the liquor cabinet with the familiarity of someone who had spent a lot of time there looking for missing socks and boxers in the dark at three in the morning. He grabbed two tumblers from the cabinet and filled both with a generous serving of firewhiskey.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Blaise, it\u2019s not even noon yet,\u201d Harry complained, but he accepted the drink and took a fortifying swallow.</p>\n<p>Blaise sank down on the sofa beside him and carefully arranged his acromantula silk robes while crossing one leg over the other. Blaise liked to present himself as a wizard of leisure but Harry knew he was an avid investor in both magical and muggle businesses, and that kept him plenty busy. It also kept him plenty rich.</p>\n<p>Blaise indicated the suitcase, sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace, with a twist of his foot. \u201cI knew when I started associating with Gryffindors I would be living dangerously.\u201d He raised his glass at Harry. \u201cBut contrary to you, I need my courage to be liquid when I\u2019m in the same room as a basilisk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed and took another sip. \u201cHe\u2019s not a basilisk. He\u2019s a wizard who got stuck as a basilisk after a botched ritual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise raised a single eyebrow, but barely, as though he was only a tiny bit impressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I was going to help turn him back, but now I\u2019ve found out he wasn\u2019t a very nice guy before and I\u2019m not sure if he deserves to be human again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Blaise glanced at Harry, swirling the whiskey around in his glass. \u201cHow long has he been stuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSixty years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot can change in sixty years, especially people,\u201d Blaise said with a knowing smile. \u201cThis reminds me of someone else who changed quite a bit, though he needed far less time than sixty years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco?\u201d Harry guessed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Blaise frowned. \u201cWell, yes, but that is not who I meant. I was talking about you.\u201d And to drive his point home, Blaise poked him in the chest with a finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d Harry asked, affronted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, dear, you were a self-righteous little prick for most of your Hogwarts career. You are a parselmouth and yet you despised everything and everyone Slytherin, simply because of what an enchanted piece of cloth said about us when we were eleven. And you didn\u2019t start changing until our sixth year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed, memories rushing him. \u201cThat summer, after my OWLs, I told my parents I wanted to be a zoologist. They had always assumed, though they never asked, that I would become an Auror. We had the biggest fight and I realized I\u2019d been trying to be someone I\u2019m not, so I changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise gave him a fond smile. \u201cI remember it well. October of our sixth year in the library. You passed me in the stacks and you said hi with a smile on your face.\u201d Blaise clutched a hand to his chest. \u201cI was so shocked I almost fainted. And when I told Draco what happened he didn\u2019t even believe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry punched Blaise lightly in the arm though he couldn\u2019t hold back a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd even then it took you another three years to have a polite conversation with a Slytherin without looking like you\u2019re constipated.\u201d Blaise observed Harry quietly for a moment. \u201cRather like you were looking earlier. So I can only assume the gentleman in question is a Slytherin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you...\u201d Harry narrowed his eyes. \u201cAre you using legilimency?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise cracked a sly grin. \u201cThere is no need for that, my dear. To me you are an open book.\u201d Blaise ignored Harry\u2019s grumbling with all the grace of a cat who ate both the canary and all the cream. \u201cSo we have a no-name half-blood or muggleborn sorted into Slytherin at least 70 years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could you possibly know he\u2019s \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>Blaise waved Harry\u2019s interruption away. \u201cIf he was a member of a pureblood family you would have told me his name already. Anyway, Slytherin has a very specific culture within its walls. Eat or be eaten. The weak will sink to the bottom while the strong rise to the top. And especially that long ago these traditions were still accompanied by a certain amount of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. He\u2019d heard enough about Slytherin House over the years from Severus and Reggie and Blaise to know he was glad to have chosen Gryffindor, but was that really enough to explain Tom\u2019s behaviour? Better yet, to excuse it?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must remember, though, that whatever his past sins were, the man has spent sixty years trapped as a serpent. One could assume that he\u2019s been punished enough.\u201d Blaise gave Harry a patient look while Harry mulled this over.</p>\n<p>With a sigh Harry downed the last of his whiskey and placed the empty glass on the coffee table. He sat forward, resting his elbows on his knees and wringing his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a point,\u201d Harry said, while Blaise placed a comforting hand on his back. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I can trust anything he says. He could pretend to be a model citizen and the moment I help turn him back he could go and murder anyone I care about in their sleep.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Blaise said, rubbing lazy circles across Harry\u2019s back. \u201cI see what this is about. Your family was betrayed once before, and now you fear being betrayed again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glanced over his shoulder at Blaise while he raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou mean Pettigrew?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise nodded. \u201cI mean Pettigrew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter Pettigrew had been best friends with Sirius, Remus and his father all throughout their Hogwarts years and beyond. He\u2019d kept up the act of good and loving friend for years while he secretly built a criminal organization that sold everything from illegal potions and endangered magical creatures to child prostitutes. He\u2019d used all the information he learned from James and Sirius, who were assigned to the case as Aurors, to always stay a few steps ahead of law enforcement. And when his organization finally was exposed he almost managed to frame Sirius and Remus, having long ago fabricated \u2018evidence\u2019 that pointed in their direction. And plenty of people, even some of Sirius\u2019 own colleagues, had bought it. After all, Sirius came from a dark family and was married to a werewolf. They were quickly thrown in prison to await trial.</p>\n<p>Pettigrew might have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn\u2019t for Regulus Black. Reggie didn\u2019t believe for one second that his brother was capable of such things, and he brought the might of the Black family down upon the Ministry. Every great-aunt and uncle, every second and third cousin was called upon to investigate, threaten or bribe anyone necessary until the truth was revealed. Pettigrew was sentenced to life in Azkaban.</p>\n<p>Harry, barely eight years old at the time, remembered a lot of crying and shouting from his parents and later on, when Sirius and Remus were released from prison, a lot of hugging and again a lot of crying. It had changed them, though, as people and as a family. Lily became a lot more suspicious of others and James lost a lot of sympathy he might have had for people who found themselves in trouble with the law through life\u2019s unfair circumstances.</p>\n<p>And Harry learned that trusting people, even those you thought were good friends, came with huge risks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Harry said with a deep sigh. \u201cThough why my parents ever trusted Pettigrew in the first place is a mystery. The bastard turned into a rat for fuck\u2019s sake. That was a pretty clear indication of his character.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only our mystery wizard was an animagus, we\u2019d be able to judge his personality easily enough.\u201d Blaise himself had become an animagus with Harry\u2019s help. He turned into a raven. A fitting form for a clever and resourceful Slytherin with commitment issues.</p>\n<p>Harry sat up and looked at Blaise with wide eyes. \u201cTom told me he\u2019s an animagus, but he didn\u2019t mention his form.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise gestured towards the suitcase. \u201cThen I suggest you go and find out what it is.\u201d And with that, Blaise emptied his glass in a single go and got up from the couch. \u201cSorry to cut this short, but I have an appointment in Aberdeen in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Blaise,\u201d Harry offered with a smile as he walked Blaise to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime, my dear.\u201d Blaise cupped Harry\u2019s face with a warm hand, gently running his thumb across Harry\u2019s cheekbone. \u201cThough if you want I can come back later to help you take your mind off your troubles for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gulped. While he and Blaise had officially broken off their relationship years ago, whenever they were both available they still hooked up from time to time. The sex was pretty fucking spectacular, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason. Sometimes it was just plain comforting to sleep wrapped in a pair of arms belonging to someone you loved and trusted. And while Blaise never said such things out loud, Harry knew he felt the same.</p>\n<p>Tempted beyond belief, Harry considered the offer for a moment but ultimately realized he had other, bigger things on his plate right now. Namely a sixty foot basilisk named Tom. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Releasing his face, Blaise gave him a knowing smile. \u201cYes, I suppose you\u2019ll want to spent some time with your new paramour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sputtered. \u201cHe\u2019s not my paramour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he? Then why are you feeling so hurt by what you\u2019ve found out about him?\u201d And before Harry could reply, Blaise slipped out of the door and apparated away. </p>\n<p>Ugh. Fucking Blaise and his annoying habit of always needing the last word. Harry shook his head and closed the door. He contemplated making himself a strong cup of tea to ward off some of the effects of the whiskey, but quickly decided he had no patience for that.</p>\n<p>He needed to know what Tom\u2019s animagus form was because it would say a lot about the man\u2019s personality. It was by no means an exact science, but in Harry\u2019s experience it was a pretty good indicator. </p>\n<p>Sirius, loyal to a fault, loving but aggressive when needed, turned into a big dog. His father, social, loving to his family, but full of pride, turned into a stag. Blaise and his clever, resourceful raven. Pettigrew, willing to sell out his closest friends, abandon them to a fate worse than death, became a snivelling rat.</p>\n<p>There was a lot of information to be found in the kind of animal that chose you, both as an animagus and for your Patronus charm. The animagus transformation and the Patronus charm had been areas of magic Harry had been interested in during his years at Hogwarts and he\u2019d studied them vigorously. Hermione used to tease him it was because both fields featured animals, and Harry supposed that was true, but he also was fascinated about what the inner animal said about the person once they were revealed.</p>\n<p>So Harry was quite confident he could make an educated guess as to Tom\u2019s real personality once he knew what kind of animal lurked beneath his skin. </p>\n<p>He flipped the suitcase lid open and climbed down. Almost immediately, Tom came sliding out of the temperate habitat. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Tom breathed, and then seemed at a loss for words as he gave Harry an anxious look. </p>\n<p>Harry pursed his lips and ignored the nervous fluttering in his stomach. \u201cTom, I am going to ask you one question and you need to answer honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, anything,\u201d Tom said at once, no hesitation. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your animagus form?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom blinked his big yellow eyes at Harry. \u201cMy animagus form?\u201d Tom ducked his head, looking away from Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d And Tom muttered something unintelligible.</p>\n<p>Harry bit back a sigh of frustration. \u201cA what, Tom? Speak up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s blazing look was positively defiant. \u201cIt\u2019s a magpie, all right? An itty, bitty bird. Some animagus form for the wizard that once aspired to become the greatest dark lord that ever lived.\u201d</p>\n<p>Releasing a shuddering breath, Harry lowered his head. A bird, which meant a thirst for freedom or wanting to break away from something. A magpie, which was a thief and a trickster, but which also represented joy and good fortune. An animal with a dual nature, delivering both good and bad omens. </p>\n<p>In other words, someone capable of both good and bad, possessing both a dark and a light side. </p>\n<p>In short, a normal human being. Not some evil megalomaniac set on death and destruction. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry said with a relieved sigh. \u201cI can work with this.\u201d </p>\n<p>Tom observed him quietly. \u201cThis pleases you?\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, in so far that I\u2019m willing to listen to what you have to say for yourself. I\u2019m willing to give you a chance.\u201d Harry grabbed the chair he\u2019d left standing in the holding area earlier, flipped it the wrong way around and sat down, arms leaning on the backrest. </p>\n<p>Releasing a long hissed breath, which sounded more relieved than anything else, Tom slid a little closer to Harry and gave him an expectant look.</p>\n<p>Harry considered the situation for a moment. He wanted, needed to know everything about the other wizard if he was to make any kind of informed decision. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where to begin. Maybe we should just go about this the Gryffindor way and dive in headfirst.\u201d He gave Tom a long, hard look. \u201cWhat would you say is the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Tom said with a pained yet resigned sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s also the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I once split my soul.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou split your soul,\u201d Harry repeated, but no matter that he heard the words again, they still made no sense to him. \u201cWhy would you even think of doing that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImmortality,\u201d Tom said in the kind of tone that suggested he was tired of even thinking about the subject, let alone talking about it. But he soldiered on. \u201cAll throughout my Hogwarts years I asked Dumbledore and Dippet to let me stay at Hogwarts during the summer. They always refused, even when the war broke out and the Blitz hit London. I had to spend months during the summer hoping the orphanage wouldn\u2019t take a direct hit while around us street after street, building after building was destroyed by muggle bombs dropping from the sky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry listened quietly, wondering why no one had thought to offer those magical kids living in London during the Blitz a place to stay outside of the city. He knew from his history lessons at the muggle primary school he and Hyacinth had attended that a lot of muggle children were evacuated from London to the countryside to stay with complete strangers for their own safety. </p>\n<p>\u201cI was genuinely terrified I wouldn\u2019t see my next school year,\u201d Tom continued. \u201cSo when I came across a method for immortality in the restricted section, it seemed like a perfect solution to my problems.\u201d Tom fell quiet for a moment, eyes squeezed shut. \u201cI was so terrified to die, so desperate to stay alive that I never wondered about the real consequences of such a method. As I know now, all rituals that promise powers of that magnitude come at a terrible price.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the price?\u201d Harry asked, fascinated yet horrified by the idea of achieving immortality by literally ripping your essence apart. </p>\n<p>\u201cInsanity,\u201d Tom whispered, eyes still shut as though admitting these things physically pained him. \u201cThe price was slowly becoming insane without even realizing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wrung his hands, his head down. That certainly explained a few things, didn\u2019t it? Why Tom choose to do some of the things he did. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut there was another price to pay,\u201d Tom went on, finally opening his eyes and giving Harry a resigned look. \u201cThe only way to split your soul is to commit murder.\u201d</p>\n<p>Inhaling a sharp breath, Harry sat back a little and stared at Tom, meeting his yellow gaze head on. There it was. The reason Tom decided to kill someone, a fellow student if Harry guessed correctly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I could do it,\u201d Tom said, coiling his body tighter around himself. \u201cAt this point I was a child that had grown up in a harsh environment, that had to fight for every scrap of anything he\u2019d ever gotten, that gave as good as he got, but I wasn\u2019t a killer. Still, I was desperate and terrified. I got lucky when I found the Chamber of Secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry, who had been staring at the floor, snapped his head up. \u201cThe what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Chamber of Secrets,\u201d Tom said slowly with an amused glint in his eyes. \u201cSalazar Slytherin himself built it when they constructed Hogwarts. It requires parseltongue to enter it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Astonished there were still parts of Hogwarts he hadn\u2019t known about, Harry slowly closed his mouth which had dropped open. He\u2019d used his father\u2019s Marauder\u2019s Map diligently throughout his Hogwarts years and he was certain he\u2019d explored every last inch of the castle. Apparently, though, he\u2019d missed a spot.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlytherin left a basilisk inside the chamber and I used her to take out my anger and resentment on the student population during my fifth year. I didn\u2019t mean for her to kill anyone, just petrify a few muggleborn students who got to go home to safe places in the muggle world. But there was a student hiding in the bathroom when the basilisk left the tunnel to her lair and before I could stop her she\u2019d killed the girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth had dropped open again. \u201cTom,\u201d he said, and swallowed once, twice. \u201cTom, what happened to the basilisk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe went back to the chamber and stayed there, hibernating. I didn\u2019t dare open the chamber again while I was at Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTom,\u201d Harry said again, voice pitched higher, in tune with the rising panic bubbling in his chest. \u201cIs there currently a basilisk at Hogwarts? A basilisk that\u2019s already killed at least one student?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you say it like that, it sounds quite terrible,\u201d Tom said with a little shake of his head. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep, I told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I get into the Chamber of Secrets?\u201d Harry demanded as he got up from his chair. There was no way he was leaving a basilisk sleeping in a secret room at Hogwarts. People he knew and cared about worked there or attended it. \u201cWe\u2019re getting that basilisk and we\u2019re relocating her to your old home in India. That\u2019s already warded and the local government knows a basilisk lives there. No need to tell anyone we\u2019ve replaced you with her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Tom said with a resigned nod. \u201cThe girl\u2019s bathroom on the second floor. There is a sink with a tap with a snake on it. Speak parseltongue and the entrance will open.\u201d Tom frowned at him. \u201cBest let me out after that point to talk to Aisa. She wasn\u2019t all that put together after spending so many centuries alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll call you out once we get there.\u201d Harry gave Tom a firm nod and climbed the ladder out of the suitcase. </p>\n<p>Harry had spent quite a bit of time during his Hogwarts years sneaking out of the castle, but this was the first time he\u2019d be sneaking in. Usually, when he needed to be at Hogwarts, Hagrid simply let him in. But he couldn\u2019t risk anyone finding out about the basilisk. She\u2019d almost certainly be killed, especially if people found out she\u2019d actually killed a student in the past, and Harry wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen. Whatever happened, it wasn\u2019t the basilisk\u2019s fault. She\u2019d been locked up in a castle for centuries. She deserved whatever semblance of freedom Harry could give her. A nice set of caves in a vast yet warded forest in India seemed like a pretty good deal compared to a secret chamber in a cold and damp castle in Scotland.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, it was the summer so the castle would only house a few staff members. No students would be endangered. Still, Harry would be transporting an actual basilisk halfway around the world this time, not just a wizard stuck as one. It couldn\u2019t hurt to be prepared, so Harry grabbed a decorative pillow from one of the armchairs near the fireplace and transfigured it into a rooster. After making sure he could make it crow on command with a well-placed imperius curse, Harry hit it with a sleeping charm and stuffed it in his backpack.</p>\n<p>The Unforgivables were only unforgivable when cast on humans. That was a nice little loophole most magical zoologists readily exploited when subduing prey animals or relocating dangerous beasts. </p>\n<p>Harry also grabbed the Marauder\u2019s Map from his old school trunk that was stored in his attic. Finally, he draped the invisibility cloak around his shoulders and he was ready to do some breaking and entering. </p>\n<p>Honeyduke\u2019s was open for business as usual and Harry had no problem slipping inside after a customer. He wasted no time and made his way to the cellar and through the trapdoor into the dark tunnel that led straight to Hogwarts. He lit his wand and activated the map, studying the positions of various staff members as he made the long trek. </p>\n<p>Hagrid was on the grounds, McGonagall was with teachers he wasn\u2019t familiar with named Bilkes and Roseworth in the Great Hall and Dumbledore was in his office. Harry would enter Hogwarts on the third floor, so he\u2019d have to hurry down one floor and into the bathroom and he\u2019d be in the clear. </p>\n<p>Just as Harry neared the entrance behind the statue, Dumbledore left his office. Harry wondered if he\u2019d tripped the wards. Squeezing himself through, Harry kept a close eye on the map. Dumbledore was slowly but surely making his way to the third floor. </p>\n<p>Bugger that. Harry was not ready in any way to explain to the headmaster why he was kidnapping a basilisk from the castle, and more importantly, how he even knew the animal was there in the first place. Thankfully, Dumbledore was beyond ancient and used a cane to get around. And Harry was in the prime of his life, supposedly. </p>\n<p>Casting a silencing charm on his feet, Harry wrapped his invisibility cloak tightly around himself and made a run for it. He dashed through the corridor, practically threw himself down the stairs to the second floor and then was stumped for a moment where the girl\u2019s bathroom even was. It\u2019s not like he\u2019d ever had to use it while attending school. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, come on,\u201d Harry muttered to himself as he speed-walked up the corridor until he spotted the bathroom in question. He burst through the door and immediately started speaking in parseltongue. \u201cOpen, Chamber of Secrets, where ever you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>To his left a section of the wall started moving, stone grinding across stone. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not loud at all,\u201d Harry whispered, just as a female ghost came flying out of a toilet stall. </p>\n<p>\u201cWho is there? Who is talking? This is a girl\u2019s bathroom, and I can hear you\u2019re a boy!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry ignored the wailing ghost and squeezed himself through the gap as soon as it was large enough. \u201cPlease close now. Good chamber, what a good chamber you are.\u201d The wall stopped moving for a second before it started sliding closed again. </p>\n<p>Harry let out a sigh of relief, and then realized it was quickly becoming pitch black. \u201cLumos,\u201d he said as he drew his wand from its holster. What greeted him was an abyss. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have warned me, Tom,\u201d he complained as he summoned his broom from his backpack. He\u2019d learned long ago that a broom was a very valuable tool in his line of work. It only took a minute to fly down what Harry realized was some kind of big stone sewer pipe that ended in a cavern with a low, rocky ceiling. </p>\n<p>It was probably a good idea to let Tom out now because Harry had no idea where the other basilisk was hiding. He pulled the suitcase from his backpack, opened the lid and stuck his head inside. \u201cTom! We\u2019re in the chamber!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry heard Tom before he saw him, scales scraping across the floor as Tom moved towards the ladder. Harry stood back as Tom emerged from the suitcase, tongue flicking in and out eagerly and almost anxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the chamber yet,\u201d Tom told him once he was free and Harry tucked the suitcase away. \u201cBut I can smell a shed skin to our right if you want to collect it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course Harry wanted to. More Galleons in the bank. The skin was in pretty good shape, so Harry folded it carefully and dropped it down into his suitcase. That would do for now. Tom was already moving forward and Harry had to hurry along to catch up with him. They saw a round, metal door which opened the moment Tom spoke to it in parseltongue. Apparently Salazar Slytherin wasn\u2019t big on actual security, perhaps trusting that only his own kin could speak the language of serpents. Well, Harry was living proof good old Sal was wrong about that. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow this is the Chamber of Secrets,\u201d Tom said as Harry followed him through the round door. Around them torches lit up with bright orange flames. Harry admired the charm work that must have been applied many centuries ago but still worked like, well, a charm. Statues of snakes lined a stone walkway that ended in a large room dominated by a truly ugly statue of a wizard. </p>\n<p>\u201cBest stay behind me now, Harry,\u201d Tom whispered and Harry did as he was told for once. No need to accidentally provoke a thousand year old basilisk in taking a bite out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen,\u201d Tom called towards the statue, and Harry watched in surprise as the mouth and jaw unhinged to form a tunnel. \u201cAisa, wake up, dearest. It\u2019s Tom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTom?\u201d a hissed voice echoed in the dark tunnel before them. The voice was distinctly female though just as other-worldly as Tom\u2019s. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me,\u201d Tom said, slowly winding closer to the statue. \u201cI\u2019ve brought a friend. He\u2019d like to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The basilisk that emerged from the tunnel was, if anything, even bigger than Tom. On second thought, Harry realized, that wasn\u2019t all that strange taking her age into account. </p>\n<p>\u201cTom, you look different. I was so worried when you stopped visiting,\u201d Aisa said as she slithered towards Tom and gently bumped her nose against his. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to leave like that, but it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d Tom gestured towards Harry with his head. \u201cThis is my friend Harry. He\u2019s here to take you to a beautiful new home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Harry said with a little wave as he took a careful step closer. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought me another speaker,\u201d Aisa said happily. \u201cHello, Harry. Why do you want to take me away from my home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr...because your new home is a beautiful set of caves in a large forest. Lots of deer to hunt and sun to bask in.\u201d Harry gestured around the chamber. \u201cA much nicer environment than this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you be there, Tom?\u201d Aisa asked as she pressed her side against Tom\u2019s large body. </p>\n<p>\u201cI will visit,\u201d Tom assured her. \u201cAs will Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry quickly confirmed. If they played this right, they\u2019d have a supply of basilisk venom and shed skins for the rest of their lives, even after Tom became human again. Harry did not want to screw this up. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, why don\u2019t you show Aisa how she will be travelling,\u201d Tom suggested with a pointed look. </p>\n<p>\u201cAisa, you\u2019ll be travelling in style,\u201d Harry said as he got his suitcase out and opened it. Tom slid inside first while Aisa looked on curiously. \u201cGo on, you\u2019ll love it,\u201d Harry told her and after a few more moments of intense tongue-flicking Aisa followed Tom down the metaphorical rabbit hole. Harry quickly slammed the lid closed, trusting Tom to give Aisa the grand tour and explain things if she had any questions. </p>\n<p>Harry wanted to get out of there and get Aisa relocated as quickly as he could. Yes, he\u2019d wanted to meet a basilisk, yes, he\u2019d sought one out, but that turned out to be a wizard in disguise. The idea of taking an actual basilisk into populated areas made Harry very nervous indeed. He was immune to the basilisk\u2019s lethal gaze, but the rest of the world wasn\u2019t. Aisa was, in essence, a magical weapon of mass destruction and the damage she could do if she got out at the wrong moment was unimaginable. Harry inhaled a deep breath to calm his wily nerves and pulled out the map to see if it was safe for him to exit the chamber.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore was walking through the second floor corridor. </p>\n<p>\u201cBuggering fuck,\u201d Harry muttered. He was almost sure at this point that he\u2019d tripped some kind of ward and that Dumbledore knew someone had snuck in. And the ghost in the bathroom may have told him what she\u2019d seen and heard.</p>\n<p>Wait a minute. Did Hogwart\u2019s wards encompass the chamber? If it had been built to be a secret then there was a good chance the wards didn\u2019t cover it. Harry pulled out his wand and cast every ward detection spell he knew. He smiled. He was right. He could get out of there without trekking all the way back through the castle and alerting Dumbledore even more to his presence. Harry picked up his backpack and apparated home. </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t waste any time and sent a quick Patronus to Severus, telling him he was travelling back to India for reasons and not to expect him back for a week or so. Harry\u2019s friends and family were used to Harry leaving the country at the drop of a hat, and if they needed him they knew to check with Severus where he was at any given time. </p>\n<p>Harry booked the necessary port-keys and left immediately. He made a pit stop in the black forest in Germany and summoned a handful of deer and wild boar, which he unceremoniously levitated down into the suitcase, trusting that two basilisks knew how to hunt them. He guessed Aisa had to be hungry and this way she\u2019d be less tempted to have him for dinner. </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until a stopover in Pakistan that the excitement of the last few days caught up with Harry and he felt dead on his feet. He booked a simple, cheap hotel room, but still pulled out his suitcase and opened it. He preferred to sleep in his own bed in his living quarters. He made sure to close and lock the lid behind himself so there would be no basilisk encounters of the accidentally lethal kind if the maid decided to stop by unannounced. Tom and Aisa were nowhere to be found, but Harry trusted they\u2019d found a comfortable spot for themselves to spend the journey. </p>\n<p>Stretching out on the sofa with a cup of tea, Harry pulled out his journal to log the latest developments. Just winding down for a moment before calling it a night. </p>\n<p>The door burst open and Tom rushed inside. All sixty foot of him. Harry\u2019s living quarters were tiny. It didn\u2019t fit and Harry\u2019s coffee table cracked and then crumbled beneath Tom\u2019s coils. Tom wound himself up as small as he could and gave a gaping Harry a pleading look.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, you have to help me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell, Tom,\u201d Harry said as he looked around his living quarters. The coffee table had disappeared under Tom\u2019s bulk entirely and Harry\u2019s small desk against the opposite wall was lost as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Aisa,\u201d Tom said, his scaly sides heaving with every anxious breath he took. \u201cShe keeps trying to...mate with me.\u201d Tom buried his nose inside his coils, eyes peeking over just enough to give Harry a look that dared him to laugh.</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t help himself. He guffawed. He quickly pressed his fist against his mouth to control himself, but it was no use. He fell over on the couch, laughing until his sides hurt. </p>\n<p>Tom hissed. \u201cSo glad my misery amuses you so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said, not feeling sorry at all. He inhaled a few big gulps of air, trying to calm down enough to have an actual conversation. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re turning her down,\u201d Harry said, barely holding back a snigger. \u201cIt must be at least 60 years since you got laid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t exactly my type,\u201d Tom snapped, burying his head even deeper inside his coils. </p>\n<p>\u201cToo scaly?\u201d Harry guessed.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo female,\u201d Tom replied with an edge to his voice. He raised his head a little and looked at Harry with a challenge in his yellow eyes.</p>\n<p>Harry held up a hand immediately. \u201cMate, I\u2019m gay myself. The wizarding world has become a little more accepting in the past decades. Even the head of the Black family is married to a man. You don\u2019t have to worry about this at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Tom raised his head, coils visibly losing some of their tension. \u201cIn my youth it wasn\u2019t talked about in polite pureblood society. If one was inclined to prefer one\u2019s own gender, it was expected one marry the opposite gender anyway and just dally on the side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded in agreement. \u201cThere are still families like that these days, but they are few and far between.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a welcome development.\u201d Tom stared at Harry for a long moment. \u201cAre you married to a man, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said with a shake of his head. He reached for his cup of tea, realized it had been lost beneath Tom\u2019s bulk, and just sat back with his hands folded in his lap. \u201cNot for lack of trying. I\u2019ve dated some, but I\u2019m away for work so often that maintaining a relationship is difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can imagine. Magical zoology certainly is an interesting career choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you complimenting me, Tom?\u201d Harry said with a teasing smile. \u201cI\u2019m certain I heard a compliment in there somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd,\u201d Tom said with a snort. \u201cI\u2019m merely commenting on your privileged background, that you were able to choose such a financially mediocre career.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wasn\u2019t surprised or insulted by Tom\u2019s assumptions. He knew his last name made people believe they knew him and his family. \u201cYeah, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong,\u201d Harry said with a sharp smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents weren\u2019t exactly happy with or supportive of my career choice,\u201d Harry explained patiently. Any old feelings of anger or frustration he\u2019d had about his parents\u2019 decisions had long been erased by the success he\u2019d had with his chosen careers. \u201cThey made it very clear they would not be paying for my mastery or my upkeep while I pursued magical zoology as a career. So I played professional Quidditch for a few years while I got my mastery in Care of Magical Creatures. I got signed right out of Hogwarts by the Montrose Magpies as their new Seeker and that allowed me to move out of my parent\u2019s house and go my own way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were a magpie,\u201d Tom said with a smile in his voice. \u201cHow amusing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking. My animagus form isn\u2019t a little black and white bird, just in case you were wondering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wondering.\u201d Tom\u2019s smile turned into a toothy grin. \u201cI\u2019ve told you mine. Perhaps you should share with the class now, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t help returning Tom\u2019s smile with a teasing one of his own. \u201cToo tired right now. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Tom could reply there was a thump coming from the door, sounding exactly like a basilisk bumping her nose against the wood. Another thump, and another one. </p>\n<p>\u201cTom?\u201d Aisa called out. \u201cTom, are you in there? I can smell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom ducked his head back inside his tightening coils, giving Harry a desperately pleading look.</p>\n<p>Laughing all over again, Harry managed to call out, \u201cTom\u2019s not feeling very well, Aisa. He\u2019s asleep right now, and I\u2019m about to turn in as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Aisa sounded disappointed indeed. \u201cThen I will see him in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night!\u201d Harry said cheerfully, and both he and Tom listened to the sound of Aisa slithering away from the door. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Tom\u2019s voice was soft but heartfelt. \u201cPlease let me sleep in here tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Harry said, since he couldn\u2019t very well let a man spend the whole night being sexually assaulted by a giant snake. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying when I said I was tired, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a very exciting few days, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Tom said, moving his body away as much as he could so Harry had room to leave the couch. Harry still had to climb across Tom\u2019s body to get to his bedroom. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt sure has been,\u201d Harry agreed as he stepped inside his bedroom. \u201cGood night, Tom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until Harry was tucked in his bed and stared up at the ceiling that something occurred to him. \u201cWhy would Aisa be trying to mate with you?\u201d he called out towards the living room. \u201cDo basilisks even reproduce sexually? In order to create a basilisk you have to \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStick a chicken egg under a toad and let them hatch it,\u201d Tom finished for him as he stuck his head inside Harry\u2019s tiny bedroom. Harry turned on his side to look at him. \u201cI have no idea if basilisks can breed but Aisa certainly thinks so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Harry said with a snigger as an idea came to him. \u201cMaybe you should give it a go, you know, for science.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Tom gave him a look that spoke of being deeply, deeply insulted. \u201cI will not subject myself to these kind of sexual acts just so you can satisfy your professional curiosity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Harry said with an exaggerated pout. \u201cJust close your eyes and think of England. I\u2019ll even give you credit in the paper I\u2019ll be writing about your sexy times with Salazar Slytherin\u2019s giant snake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are an impossible child.\u201d Tom threw his nose in the air and retreated back to the living room. Harry was sure he heard the couch groan and crack in a way it shouldn\u2019t, but he was too amused to care. Besides, he had magic. A few waves of his wand in the morning and everything would be fixed. Harry closed his eyes and fell asleep with a smile on his face.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until the next day, after Harry arrived in Mumbai for the second time in a week that it occurred to him that he\u2019d had a really nice time talking to Tom, and he wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about that. </p>\n<p>Tom was a murderer and a man who had once aspired to become the world\u2019s most powerful Dark Lord. Harry had heard that from Tom\u2019s own lips. Then again, Tom had been an utter imbecile while still a child in many ways and had accidentally turned himself insane. There was still a lot Harry didn\u2019t know about Tom and what exactly had happened to him over the years. </p>\n<p>Not to mention, Harry still didn\u2019t know what kind of ritual Tom had used. Harry was determined to find out all this and more, but after he relocated Aisa. Harry didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been as nervous in his whole life as he was when he walked from the Mumbai portkey station through some very busy muggle areas to the public floo stations. Around him, hundreds of people were going about their day, driving cars while honking their horns, selling and buying spicy foods in dozens of shops and stalls, and here Harry was walking among them while carrying two creatures around in his bag that could kill them all with a look. </p>\n<p>Harry allowed himself no more distractions, internal or external, and focussed on getting to Van Vihar National Park as fast as he could. It took him another day of travelling and of sharing his living quarters with Tom while he caught a few hours of sleep until he stood in front of the ward line again. The crack he\u2019d opened a week ago was still there, closed again but easily wrenched open with a few flicks of his wand. Inside the warded area Harry used his broom to get to the cave system Tom had called home for sixty years.</p>\n<p>Everything looked the same as how they\u2019d left it and Harry doubted anyone had even noticed the basilisk missing for a week. They probably wouldn\u2019t notice a different basilisk, opposite gender and all, taking up residence either. Harry opened the suitcase in front of the cave system. </p>\n<p>\u201cAisa, Tom, we\u2019re here.\u201d Harry stood back as Aisa stuck her head out of the suitcase, flicked her tongue a few times, and then slid outside, blinking in wonder while looking up at the sun. Tom was far more reluctant to follow. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt smells so nice here,\u201d Aisa said as she slithered around. \u201cLike earth and water and prey and Tom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAisa, could I ask you for a favour?\u201d Harry asked, not wanting to miss this opportunity. He wasn\u2019t sure when he\u2019d have a chance to visit her again. \u201cCould I take some of your venom?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMy venom?\u201d Aisa looked at him while she tilted her head. \u201cDo you want to use mine because you don\u2019t have your own?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething like that. All you\u2019d have to do is bite down in some buckets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aisa nodded. \u201cYou can have some because you brought me to this wonderful place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry got to work at once, preparing two buckets, while Aisa wandered around, exclaiming how much she liked her new environment. Tom stayed close to the suitcase. </p>\n<p>The process of extracting Aisa\u2019s venom was as easy as Tom\u2019s had been and before long Harry carefully levitated two almost full buckets down into the suitcase to store in a cupboard. He couldn\u2019t wait to see Severus\u2019 face when Harry gave him two full buckets now, and another two next week when he could milk Tom again. Severus would probably spread out the sale somewhat as not to flood the market and bring the price down. Then again, Basilisk venom was so rare and every potioneer worldwide would dearly love to get their hands on some that Harry didn\u2019t think a few extra buckets would make a dent in the global demand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you staying with me, Tom?\u201d Aisa asked as Harry told her it was time to say goodbye. </p>\n<p>Tom gave Harry a very anxious look which Harry didn\u2019t understand at first until it dawned on him that Tom was genuinely worried Harry would leave him there. \u201cNo,\u201d Harry said in Tom\u2019s stead. \u201cTom is coming with me. He\u2019s going to help me with my next job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Aisa gave Tom a very disappointed look. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll visit,\u201d Tom assured her. \u201cGoodbye, Aisa. You\u2019ll love this place, I\u2019m sure.\u201d And with that Tom slid inside the suitcase and Harry quickly closed the lid. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop by as often as we can. Enjoy the sun and all the prey that lives in this forest. Goodbye.\u201d Harry mounted his broom and took off at once, suitcase in hand. He did not want to give Aisa a chance to demand to come along or forcibly try to make Tom stay. Thankfully, Aisa stayed put and Harry could make a clean escape. </p>\n<p>That night, Harry warded a small patch of forest many miles away from Van Vihar and opened his suitcase. He met Tom in the holding area.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you think I was going to leave you there?\u201d Harry asked, both amused and a little sad that Tom apparently thought so little of him.</p>\n<p>Tom shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have blamed you if you had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m the kind of guy who would do that? Who\u2019d leave you to be assaulted for the next few centuries?\u201d Harry really was feeling a little hurt by this latest development.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Tom seemed surprised by his own sharp denial as he blinked at Harry. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure I deserve a second chance. Maybe it would be better if I was locked away for the rest of my life. Preferably without Aisa, but still... I wouldn\u2019t blame you, Harry, if you made sure I was properly punished. I haven\u2019t been a good man in the years I was human.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. Tom just voiced some of the thoughts Harry had been struggling with himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet, to be honest. I want to hear more about what happened to you before I make a decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair. Whatever you want to know, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s stomach let him know he had other priorities now. \u201cThanks, but that has to wait until later. I\u2019m starving right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom followed Harry to his living quarters but kept the bulk of his body outside this time. Only his head rested inside to observe everything Harry did. Harry peeled a few potatoes with a flick of his wand and got them boiling in a pot of water on the stove. Then he opened a can of beef stew with carrots, dumped it in a pan and got that heating up as well. Harry loved muggle canned foods. They kept forever, came in lots of variety and tasted pretty good combined with potatoes, rice or pasta. Harry was a busy guy, especially when on the road. He didn\u2019t have time to prepare elaborate meals.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d Tom asked just as Harry put the kettle on to make a cup of tea. \u201cThat you needed me for a job?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt that time, no,\u201d Harry said as he stuck a teabag in a mug and poured boiling water over it. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been thinking. How would you like to go hunt some acromantulas? Their venom sells for quite a bit these days, not to mention their silk, and we\u2019ll split the earnings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAcromantulas?\u201d Tom moved a little further into the living quarters, but still keeping most of his body outside. \u201cWhere? And how do you hunt them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know a few colonies here in India. There\u2019s a big one in the Sundarbans that\u2019s considered vermin and open to hunting because they occasionally hunt the local endangered tiger population.\u201d Harry stirred his stew as he waited for his potatoes to be done. \u201cWhen I hunt them alone, I fly high above the colony, because those fuckers can jump, and summon one into a wooden crate I have hanging from my broom. Not without risk, because one gust of wind and the spider misses the crate and ends up in your face.\u201d Harry grinned at Tom who was looking at him as if he were completely mad. \u201cBut with you there, we can simply drop in the middle of the colony, you take a look around and we have a dozen or so dead spiders while the rest flee in terror. Easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Tom repeated, but in an entirely different tone of voice. \u201cYou call that easy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCompared to my earlier method, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom sighed. \u201cI suppose it would be good to add a bit more to my savings in case I do one day get my old body back.\u201d He moved as though squaring his shoulders and gave Harry a decisive nod. \u201cVery well. Let\u2019s pretend I\u2019m a Gryffindor and we can hunt some giant man-eating spiders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Harry said, excitement coursing through him. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chapter 8</p>\n<p>During Harry\u2019s second year at Hogwarts, Hagrid had taken Harry into the Forbidden Forest one Saturday afternoon to meet his best friend, Aragog. Harry had been secretly a little terrified of Aragog, but since Hagrid clearly loved the giant spider, Harry had kept it together during their meeting. </p>\n<p>Harry hadn\u2019t kept it together, however, when after their meeting with the old spider, Aragog\u2019s many offspring had decided to turn Harry into dinner. Apparently, Aragog\u2019s kids had promised their daddy they wouldn\u2019t ever eat Hagrid, but they had made no such promises about any guests Hagrid was stupid enough to bring into their lair. </p>\n<p>To make a long story very short, Hagrid and Harry had barely made it out of there alive, and Harry had learned a very important lesson. No, two very important lessons. </p>\n<p>One, that he despised acromantulas with a vengeance, and two, that not all magical creatures should be preserved at all costs. </p>\n<p>Newt and Hagrid were the kind of men to see the good in any creature, even an enormous man-eating spider, and would never think to harm them. </p>\n<p>Harry, on the other hand, had no problems killing the crap out of eight-legged beasts that bred like rabbits and had the potential to destroy entire ecosystems should they establish themselves somewhere they weren\u2019t native. Hagrid had been unknowingly very lucky he\u2019d released Aragog into a forest that housed centaurs who kept the acromantula population in check by hunting the beasts and using their silk and fangs for all manner of objects. If Aragog\u2019s offspring hadn\u2019t been kept in check there wouldn\u2019t have been a single living animal found in the Forbidden Forest, magical or not, after a decade or so. Acromantulas were not picky eaters and killed anything they could find. </p>\n<p>Harry portkeyed to Calcutta and flooed to Gosaba, on the edge of the Sundarbans. From there he took his broomstick while hiding under his invisibility cloak and took off across the largest mangrove forest in the world. The trees were thick and the ground soaked, if there was ground at all, because a lot of the forest was a crisscross of streams, rivers and tidal areas. </p>\n<p>It was a stunning place, but not without any risks. Aside from the invasive acromantula population, the local tiger population was also a very real threat to people who visited the area, wizard or muggle. Because even for a wizard with magic, a tiger was a fierce opponent, especially because it was very difficult to see them coming in the shadowy undergrowth of a dense forest. Therefore, Harry stayed on his broom and kept above the treetops until he found the area where the acromantulas had their nest. </p>\n<p>Before travelling south, Harry and Tom had discussed their plan, which was incredibly simple, so Harry knew he could get started on the attack right away. </p>\n<p>While hovering on his broomstick above the colony, Harry got his suitcase out of his backpack and kept it ready in one hand, while with the other he steered his broom down at a high speed, bursting through the canopy and taking the many, many man-eating spiders completely by surprise. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow!\u201d Harry yelled, dropping the suitcase to the floor and kicking it open with his foot. At once, Tom burst out the opening, yellow eyes blazing and all around them acromantulas started screaming, a noise so high pitched that it hurt Harry\u2019s ears. </p>\n<p>Well, that was something Harry had to write down in his journal as soon as he could, because before that moment Harry hadn\u2019t known acromantulas could scream. Tom slithered around in a circle while all around them spiders that hadn\u2019t yet met his killing gaze fled in all directions. Many, though, did meet their end and fell from the trees around them, legs curled inward as they hit the ground with dull thuds. </p>\n<p>The chaos only lasted less than a minute and after that the quiet returned and Harry looked around in awe. There had to be at least thirty or so carcasses spread around them, in all sizes, from very young spiders the size of French bulldogs to full grown specimens the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. </p>\n<p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d Harry said with an awed laugh before turning to Tom, eyes wide and slightly disbelieving. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be so rich. I know at least six more acromantula colonies that are open to hunting. I say we visit them all. Their silk alone is worth a ton these days, not to mention their venom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Tom agreed with a toothy smile, looking around in obvious satisfaction. \u201cIt hardly even feels like work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, the work comes now,\u201d Harry said as he started breaking off branches from the trees around them. \u201cFirst, we harvest the silk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Tom asked curiously as he slithered closely. </p>\n<p>\u201cWith magic, surprisingly,\u201d Harry said with a completely straight face, which earned him a loud snort from Tom. \u201cHere, let me show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry waved his wand around at the backend of the first dead spider, gently pulling a strand of silk out from between the spinnerets. He wound that strand of silk around the three foot long branch and then charmed the branch to stay upright and rotate slowly but surely, pulling all the silk out of the spider in one long strand while winding it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIngenious,\u201d Tom commented as Harry got to work on the second spider. It really wasn\u2019t very difficult work. The real fun started when Harry was done with the silk, storing it all away in an enlarged trunk inside the suitcase, and got his dragonhide gloves out plus a whole tray of glass mason jars. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow we get the venom.\u201d Harry placed a mason jar under a fang and pressed the venom gland on the side of the spider\u2019s face to fill it up. He repeated the process with every fang on every dead spider until he had over sixty jars full of yellow venom. He very carefully stored those away inside the suitcase, because that was worth a small fortune. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow about the rest of them?\u201d Tom asked, looking between Harry and the spiders. \u201cAre any other parts worth money, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Harry said with a grin. \u201cThe eyes go for a nice amount, for potions, as do the fangs, which are used both in wand making in some countries and in jewellery. The rest of the bodies aren\u2019t worth as much, but thirty spiders like this will still make quite a nice amount of Galleons. By myself I usually only manage to catch one or two spiders, and when broken down they pay the bills for up to four months or so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re definitely hunting more of them, then,\u201d Tom said, getting out of the way as Harry levitated all the carcasses into the suitcase. He\u2019d put them under preservation charms and harvest the eyes and fangs later, to keep everything fresh. Tom followed him inside the suitcase and stayed there while Harry got back on his broom and flew them out of the Sundarbans. Since it was getting dark quickly, Harry put up some simple wards to keep muggles away on a stretch of grass with a smattering of trees on the outskirts of Gosaba, placed his suitcase on the ground and climbed inside. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pooped,\u201d Harry said, stretching his arms over his head. Tom came slithering out of the temperate habitat, where he\u2019d been swimming again by the looks of his wet, shiny scales. \u201cAnd I need a bath, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do reek like dead spiders,\u201d Tom said with an obvious tongue flick aimed at Harry, who, in a move that was not at all childish, stuck his tongue out back at Tom before quickly disappearing into his private quarters. </p>\n<p>Harry took a quick shower in the small bathroom and got dressed in fresh pyjamas, dumping his dirty clothes in the overflowing hamper. He really needed to do laundry once they got back home. </p>\n<p>And thoughts of returning home reminded Harry there were still things to discuss with Tom. Important things. They\u2019d left Britain in a hurry to relocate Aisa, since that took priority over anything else, but that didn\u2019t mean that Harry was going to forget that Tom had split his soul and committed murder. </p>\n<p>For dinner, Harry boiled some pasta on the stove and heated up a can of chunky pasta sauce with meat and veggies. He ate it on the couch while Tom poked his head through the doorway inside the living quarters, watching quietly while Harry finished his meal. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a conversation to finish,\u201d Harry said, putting his empty plate on the coffee table and leaning back in the couch while gazing at Tom steadily. </p>\n<p>\u201cA conversation?\u201d Tom asked, seeming genuinely confused for a moment before his eyes widened for a second. \u201cAh, yes, that conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed and rubbed a hand across his face. He didn\u2019t like this part much, either, but he needed to know what Tom had been up to when he was still a human if he was going to help him become human once more. \u201cYeah, you were telling me about how you\u2019d let Aisa kill a student. Wait, was that student that annoying ghost that hangs out in the girl\u2019s bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat ghost?\u201d Tom asked, giving Harry a befuddled look. </p>\n<p>\u201cMoaning Myrtle. I briefly met her when sneaking into the Chamber and Hermione used to complain about her all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, the student\u2019s name was Myrtle Warren.\u201d Tom nodded solemnly. \u201cI was able to frame another student who was keeping an acromantula as a pet for Warren\u2019s death. The acromantula got away, unfortunately, but the student got expelled.\u201d</p>\n<p>Very slowly, Harry closed his eyes and leaned forward to press his face into his hands. Every fucking time Tom opened his mouth, worse things came out. \u201cTom,\u201d Harry asked very softly. \u201cDid you get Hagrid expelled?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, that was his name. Hagrid.\u201d Tom seemed to warm up to the subject and started talking a little louder in his enthusiasm. \u201cHagrid had already received numerous warnings for keeping dangerous animals inside the castle, even inside his dormitory. I\u2019d caught him with his acromantula, since I was a Prefect, and reprimanded him thoroughly because keeping a man-eating spider in a castle full of children is madness, and Hagrid had promised to get rid of it but then didn\u2019t, so I was planning to turn him over to the authorities when Aisa killed Warren and I realized I could see Hagrid punished for the acromantula while taking the blame for Aisa\u2019s accident. I thought it was quite the elegant solution, all things considered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry counted to ten, and then to twenty, so he wouldn\u2019t curse the stuffing out of Tom, even though he really wanted to. \u201cHagrid is my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom recoiled a little, ducking his head while staring at Harry. \u201cOh. I hadn\u2019t realized.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s another life you\u2019ve ruined,\u201d Harry whispered. </p>\n<p>\u201cIn my defence, Hagrid would have been expelled sooner rather than later, or did you miss the part about him keeping a man-eating spider in a school full of children?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of Hagrid\u2019s short-sightedness when it comes to dangerous beasts, especially enormous spiders,\u201d Harry said through gritted teeth while a shiver ran down his spine as he remembered that ill-faithed trip into the Forbidden Forest during his second year. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019ve hurt a friend of mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe would have been expelled anyway the moment I reported the acromantula to the authorities,\u201d Tom said, sounding just a tad desperate. \u201cWhat difference does it make in the end why he got expelled, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry released another sigh, leaning back to stare up at the ceiling. Tom actually made a good point, even though a large part of Harry was still silently fuming over the injustice done to Hagrid. Except, as Tom told it, there hadn\u2019t been much injustice, because Hagrid had kept a man-eating spider in a school full of children. Harry knew this, because Hagrid happily told that tale to all who would listen. </p>\n<p>Fucking hell. Tom really did have a point there. </p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry finally said, anger slowly draining away. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that one. Hagrid probably would have been expelled over the acromantula anyway. Case closed. Please continue your story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d Tom moved a little closer to Harry again, massive head tilted slightly as though asking for permission. Harry didn\u2019t object and that seemed enough for Tom to move a little closer still. \u201cAnyway, after Warren\u2019s death I basically created a horcrux in an act of desperation, since I had to return to London that summer again and I genuinely feared for my life. I just didn\u2019t have all the information about horcruxes yet, how they will drive you insane eventually. I used my muggle diary since I didn\u2019t even have a suitable object prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s one horcrux, but you said you made multiple,\u201d Harry said, dreading the rest of Tom\u2019s story.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I did that the following summer,\u201d Tom said, and it looked as though he was squaring his shoulders, the way he rearranged his body. \u201cI tracked down my useless father and grandparents, killed them and framed my muggle-hating uncle, who was more of a squib than a wizard. The Gaunt family, of which my mother was a member, were known for marrying not just their own cousins, but their siblings as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yeah,\u201d Harry said with a shake of his head. \u201cThat kind of family. Most of them eventually go extinct because they lose their magic through inbreeding. My mom did a study into this phenomenon when she just became a healer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d Tom seemed a little bashful all of a sudden, massive head swinging to the side. \u201cIt took me many years to realize that I should probably be grateful that my mother chose a muggle as the father of her child. If she\u2019d followed tradition and fucked her own brother, I would have been a squib.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, almost certainly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor many years I resented the fact that my father was a muggle. I no longer feel like that. I will, however, never forgive him or my grandparents that they left me to rot in an orphanage while they lived a life of wealth and privilege. So I don\u2019t regret killing them and I never will. I used those deaths to create my second horcrux and I used an old family heirloom, my uncle\u2019s ring, for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s two,\u201d Harry said, just to keep track. So far Harry was glad no new murders he wasn\u2019t already aware of were being recounted. \u201cAny more than that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tom said with a sigh, though Harry wasn\u2019t sure if it sounded relieved or exhausted. \u201cI had planned to create more, and I was even eying up some ancient artifacts some old witch was hoarding to use as the new containers, but before I thought up a plan to get my hands on those I came across a vague reference to the ritual of longevity and decided to pursue that, since by that time I\u2019d read up on horcruxes some more and had come across some references that they might cause insanity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you travelled to India and met the sorceress?\u201d Harry guessed. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I took a vacation from my job at Borgin and Burke\u2019s and used some of my savings to travel to India, where I met the sorceress who gave me the details of the ritual, which I performed right there and then and well, the rest as they say is history.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they say Gryffindors are impulsive,\u201d Harry said with an amused grin. \u201cBut by the sound of it you had some serious impulse control issues as well, Mr Slytherin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom shook his head and seemed downright embarrassed for a moment. \u201cI am aware I may have acted a little impulsively at some critical moments in my life, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much do you remember of the ritual?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Harry reached for his wand and summoned his journal out of his bedroom, together with a self-inking quill. \u201cTell me every detail, because I know a guy who does have access to the Black Family Library and he\u2019s willing to look into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom spoke carefully, going over everything he remembered from the ritual and how he\u2019d performed it, and Harry dutifully wrote it all down, making sure he got every little detail right. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said when Tom was finally finished. \u201cOnce we\u2019re back in Britain, I\u2019ll owl Barty this. Where are your horcruxes now? Did you keep them in your Gringotts vault, because your friends emptied that out when they had you declared dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I never stored them there.\u201d Tom looked puzzled for a moment, eyes narrowed while looking down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I still have horcruxes, to be honest, because ever since I performed the ritual of longevity, I\u2019ve felt more\u2026whole and complete.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Harry said, because that would make things a lot easier. Tom with a complete soul was likely less prone to violence and killing than a Tom whose soul was still in tatters. \u201cWe could collect the items and check them, I assume?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, we could do that,\u201d Tom agreed easily. \u201cI hid the ring in the Gaunt shack under some quite terrifying curses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the other one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gave the diary to Abraxas Malfoy for safekeeping,\u201d Tom said and gave Harry a questioning look. \u201cIs Abraxas still alive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said with a groan. \u201cBut his son, Lucius is. And Lucius and his wife Narcissa hate my guts, so I think we\u2019re better off with the terrifying curses for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can tell you exactly how to break the wards and get around those curses,\u201d Tom quickly said, looking just a bit worried. \u201cDoes this mean you are going to help me become human again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked and realized that apparently he had been working towards that, even if he hadn\u2019t yet made up his mind officially. But here was the thing\u2026Harry liked Tom as he was now. The man was a giant snake, which was fascinating to a zoologist, but what Harry truly liked about Tom was his personality. Tom was clever and funny and just a bit haughty with a side of arrogance, yet at the same time possessed a very real talent for seeing through his own bullshit, at least he did now. </p>\n<p>So, the question Harry now had to answer for himself was, did Tom deserve a second chance as a human? As Blaise had pointed out, Tom had basically spent the last sixty years imprisoned in solitary confinement, so he had been punished for all the wrongs he\u2019d done in his younger years. He\u2019d done the crime, but he most certainly also had done the time, as the saying went. And he seemed remorseful, at least about certain things, and he also seemed to no longer aspire to become a Dark Lord. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you do once you\u2019re human again?\u201d Harry asked, because that was something Tom hadn\u2019t elaborated on yet. </p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly? Really boring, silly, human stuff.\u201d Tom smiled until his fangs were showing. \u201cTake a hot bath, drink tea, sleep in a soft bed, eat something other than live, whole animals, read books\u2026Merlin, yes, read lots and lots of books.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chuckling, Harry got up to wash his dirty plate and make himself a cup of tea. Tom\u2019s suggestion had made Harry crave some tea of his own. \u201cAnd in the long run?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Tom said with a bit of a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck like this for so long that I\u2019d genuinely given up hope of ever returning to my human form. I suppose now that I\u2019m earning money, I could live the rest of my life in a nice cottage somewhere, just enjoy being human again, and if I get bored perhaps involve myself in some academics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, the rest of your life?\u201d Harry turned to stare at Tom in confusion. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m well over eighty years old, Harry, or have you forgotten?\u201d Tom\u2019s smile looked rather sad yet resigned. \u201cAnd with my inbred genetics, I doubt I\u2019ll live as long as some healthy wizards might. I\u2019d just be happy to have a few healthy years as a human before my time is up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry suddenly felt as if the wind got knocked out of him and he had to inhale a few deep breaths to chase away the sudden light-headedness he felt. He\u2019d forgotten Tom was that old and in his mind, whenever he imaged Tom becoming human again he saw him as a man in his twenties, the age Tom had been when he\u2019d performed the ritual. But now Harry realized that Tom might very well be right and should they reverse the ritual, Tom would be an old man. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Harry said, blinking rapidly a few times before he looked at Tom. \u201cI do believe you deserve a second chance, so I\u2019ll help you become human again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chapter 9</p>\n<p>Now that Harry knew Tom\u2019s remaining time was limited, he wasted not a second in getting back to Britain so he could seriously start on getting Tom back to his authentic self. Thankfully Harry now knew exactly which portkeys to book to make the journey as quickly as possible. </p>\n<p>Once back in his cottage in Hogsmeade, Harry copied his notes about the ritual Tom had used onto a few sheets of paper and rolled them up. Since his beloved owl Hedwig had passed away a few years ago from old age, Harry hadn\u2019t felt the need to replace her, since honestly, there was no replacing her. And since Severus took care of most of their business correspondence anyway, Harry simply used a post office owl if he had a letter to send. Which is exactly what he did that afternoon, even though his mind was slowly succumbing to some kind of jetlag from having travelled halfway across the globe more than once in the span of a week or so. </p>\n<p>While Harry strolled through Hogsmeade on his way to the post office he considered if he should perhaps let Hermione in on the research for a reverse ritual as well. On the plus side, Hermione was easily as smart as Barty, and just as capable a researcher. On the down side, Hermione was not well read in anything dark magic, in fact she despised just the thought of it. </p>\n<p>Harry used to be the same, unsurprisingly, having grown up in a proud Gryffindor family who openly and gladly supported Dumbledore and his agenda to see all dark magic eradicated. </p>\n<p>And then Harry had started hanging out with Slytherins, had gone into business with them, had started dating them, and he\u2019d come to his senses enough to realize dark magic wasn\u2019t necessarily evil, it was just a different side of the same magical coin. </p>\n<p>Hermione, though, hadn\u2019t undergone such a personal shift in her viewpoints on magic, and therefore Harry ruled her out as a potential source of help, at least for now. If Barty was unable to come up with anything, then Harry would consider the rest of his options, but for now Harry put his faith in his honorary uncle, because he knew Barty had no problems delving as deep into dark magic as he needed to solve a magical mystery.</p>\n<p>After sending off his letter to Barty, Harry strolled through the village towards Severus\u2019 home. </p>\n<p>Severus answered Harry\u2019s knock after just a few moments and he immediately narrowed his eyes when he saw who was at the door. \u201cIs the beast with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry held up his hands in surrender. \u201cYeah, but he\u2019s secured, I promise. I just came to drop of 30 acromantulas worth of venom and silk. My new best friend and I went hunting in the Sundarbans yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus blinked, face carefully blank, before he gestured to the side of the house. \u201cJust put it in the backyard for now, I\u2019ll take it inside momentarily.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry understood all too well why Severus refused Harry entry with Tom the basilisk tucked away in his trunk, because he could hear Severus\u2019 twin girls shrieking with joy from within the house. So Harry didn\u2019t object and simply pushed the gate to the side of the cottage open and unloaded the venom and silk, placing them carefully against the side of the cottage. </p>\n<p>Once home again, Harry climbed into his suitcase where Tom was waiting for him in the main holding area. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent the ritual to Barty,\u201d Harry told him while he started breaking down the acromantula carcasses that were still piled up under a preservation charm. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the smartest guys I know, so I have good hopes he\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tom said sincerely, not for the first time since Harry had announced he\u2019d help his new best friend. </p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d Harry gave Tom a brief smile while he started pulling out the acromantula eyes with a quick spell, placing them in straw-lined crates with extra cushioning and preservation charms. \u201cTell me in detail about the defences around the Gaunt shack, because while we wait to hear from Barty I think it would be a good idea to gather your horcruxes to see if they\u2019re still active or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom blinked and tilted his head a little. \u201cWhy go for the ring that\u2019s got some serious dark magic on it instead of the diary that\u2019s lying about Malfoy Manor somewhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckled while he finished up with the eyes and moved on to ripping out the fangs. \u201cBecause Lucius and his wife Narcissa hate my guts. Well, not me personally, but all Potters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened? In my time Abraxas had no such problems with your family that I recall.\u201d Tom moved his large body out of the way a little when Harry levitated an expanded trunk closer and placed the spider carcasses inside of it once he was done with them. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents were friends with a wizard named Peter Pettigrew, who basically built a criminal empire behind everyone\u2019s backs. Bellatrix Lestrange, Narcissa\u2019s sister, was one of Pettigrew\u2019s business associates and she was found guilty as well on a whole mountain of criminal charges and sentenced to 80 years in Azkaban along with her husband Rodolphus Lestrange.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat on earth did she do to earn such a sentence?\u201d Tom asked, looking rather impressed. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe specialized in child slaves. She\u2019d kidnap muggle children, obliviate their parents, and sell them as fuck toys to depraved purebloods, basically.\u201d Harry shrugged, having heard the story so often by now that it hardly affected him anymore. \u201cLucius and Narcissa were also brought forward as suspects in the investigation, though not for those horrible crimes. They allegedly smuggled endangered magical creatures for potion ingredients, or something like that, but they were never officially charged. My dad claims Lucius bought his way out of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the mighty have fallen,\u201d Tom said with a contemplative nod. \u201cIn my days both the Malfoys and the Lestranges were respectable pureblood families, who would never have involved themselves in such obvious criminal activities. Bribing a few politicians here and there, sure. But kidnapping muggle children to be used as sex toys, absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry finished up a few more spiders and tucked them away in the trunk. \u201cRegulus theorized it\u2019s because of Dumbledore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs much as I despise Dumbledore,\u201d Tom said with an amused little quirk of his mouth, \u201cand I despise him a great, great deal, how on earth is this the old man\u2019s fault?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbledore got a lot of traction with his light propaganda over the past few decades, he got a lot of different kinds of dark magic banned and such.\u201d Harry leaned back against the wooden pillar behind him and stretched out his wand arm to ward off any stiffness. \u201cRegulus thinks that because there was no effective political pushback to that from the conservative factions, they descended into criminality as a giant \u2018fuck you\u2019 to polite society.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn interesting theory,\u201d Tom mused while Harry got back to work. \u201cBut surely not all dark families became common criminals?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, there\u2019s plenty still around. Some adapted and became just progressive enough to still be accepted, like Regulus and Barty, or even the Malfoy\u2019s only son Draco. Other families have moved to the fringes of society, become reclusive and keep to themselves basically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your parents were involved in sending Narcissa Malfoy\u2019s sister to prison and therefore they despise you all nowadays,\u201d Tom finally concluded as he shifted his large coils to make room for Harry again. </p>\n<p>Harry tucked the last of the spider carcasses inside the expanded trunk and stacked all the crates of eyes and fangs. He\u2019d drop them off at Severus\u2019 later. \u201cExactly right. You can tell me about all the protections you put on that Gaunt ring while I finally tackle my laundry.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Tom did, going into great detail while Harry got out the shrunk washtub and wringer, enlarged them and summoned his small mountain of dirty clothes. Harry listened carefully, asked questions as needed and in the meantime washed his clothes with a few well-practised charms before drying them with a stream of warm air coming straight out of his wand. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go first thing tomorrow morning,\u201d Harry said once he had his freshly washed clothes folded and tucked away in the small wardrobe in his bedroom. </p>\n<p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Tom said with real worry in his voice. \u201cThat curse I put on the ring is a real nasty piece of work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you create it?\u201d Harry asked curiously as he went through his pantry in the small kitchen to see what he needed to stock up on, as he always did once he came home from travelling. </p>\n<p>\u201cI did, yeah.\u201d Tom hung his head a little. \u201cI created lots of vile curses, just because I could. It never even occurred to me that I could put my magical talents to use in creating things that might be useful to others and earn me some serious money along the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just wanted to lash out,\u201d Harry guessed, familiar with that kind of feeling. Harry had been a ball of fury and frustration in his fifth year at Hogwarts, when it became clear that he would never win his Dad\u2019s approval, no matter what he did. It had taken a whole schoolyear of lashing out at others before Harry realized he could just go his own way, after a few extensive talks with both Sirius and Regulus, who had in their own ways done exactly that themselves when they were Harry\u2019s age. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, hurting others was far easier than dealing with the emotional pain I felt,\u201d Tom agreed quietly. </p>\n<p>Harry nodded in understanding. \u201cBut you know better now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, I promise you that.\u201d Tom raised his head a little and gave Harry an intense stare. \u201cOnce I\u2019m able to cast magic again, I\u2019m going to be productive instead of destructive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Smiling, Harry patted Tom on his scaly shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll come up with. I\u2019m going to drop off the acromantula parts at Severus\u2019 real quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry used his broom to quickly fly to Severus\u2019 cottage, too tired to apparate, and after a quick talk with Severus, he stacked the crates and trunk in the garden for Severus to collect. The acromantula parts, combined with the basilisk parts, would soon enough earn Harry a small fortune and which gave Harry real peace of mind for his future. This ensured that he\u2019d basically have enough money to live off all the way through his retirement, as long as he didn\u2019t go and splurge it all.</p>\n<p>Since he was about to fall over from an immediate need for sleep, Harry quickly ate a bowl of soup once he got home and then crawled into his bed where he pretty much passed out at once. </p>\n<p>The next morning, after a short talk with Tom to go over the plan one last time, and after carefully examining some maps of England, Harry apparated to Little Hangleton, a town where he\u2019d never been before. </p>\n<p>It turned out to be a historical muggle market town, similar to the dozens and dozens of market towns that were dotted around the English countryside. Tom had given him directions as best he could to the Gaunt Shack, but it still took Harry a good half hour of walking up and down several country lanes before he spotted the hovel that was mostly covered by the surrounding weeds and brushes, with trees almost completely hiding it from view. </p>\n<p>Harry had to slice his way through a thick wall of ivy to even get to the front door, which was covered in wards only a parselmouth could pass. Well, that wasn\u2019t a problem for Harry. </p>\n<p>Once inside the shack, Harry had to do some more serious weed whacking because the ivy had gotten in through some broken windows and covered almost every surface of the small room. </p>\n<p>Finally, Harry had enough cleared space to use a few charms to detect magical artifacts, and one particular area under the floorboards lit up like a Yule log. Harry summoned a nearby woodpigeon from a tree outside, as Tom had instructed he should, and then carefully removed the floorboards, revealing the simple ring. Without thought, and without giving the compulsion charms on the ring a chance to grab hold of him, Harry dumped the fluttering pigeon on top of the ring, triggering the curse. </p>\n<p>The poor bird died instantly, feathers turning black and withering away while its skin shrivelled up into a dried husk. With a small shudder, Harry levitated the pigeon out of the hole, vanished it and then used every detection spell he knew on the ring, to make sure there were no other curses left on it, just to be sure. But no, the one vile curse had been spent and the ring was safe to handle, just as Tom promised him it would be. </p>\n<p>Harry picked it up and tucked it in his pocket, and pushed the floorboard back into place. He wanted to get out of there before anyone at the ministry might pick up on the dark magic that had just been released. Harry knew from his dad that these days the ministry had many ways to monitor for forbidden magics, and the last thing Harry wanted was to end up sitting in an Auror interrogation room while trying to explain to his father why he\u2019d felt the need to trigger a horrifically dark curse on an heirloom ring.</p>\n<p>Brushing some more ivy to the side with a few waves of his wand, Harry left the cottage and pushed the door closed behind him as well as he could, considering that it barely hung straight on its hinges anymore. </p>\n<p>When Harry looked up, he saw Albus Dumbledore standing in front of him. </p>\n<p>Dumbledore had remained a physically powerful wizard well into old age, but these days it seemed that his advanced age really had caught up with him. Dumbledore\u2019s posture was slightly stooped, even if he obviously tried to hide that, and he needed a cane to get around with. Still, his eyes were ever sharp and Harry made himself no illusions about Dumbledore\u2019s ability to kick Harry\u2019s arse in a duel, even as old as he was now. </p>\n<p>\u201cHeadmaster?\u201d Harry asked in obvious surprise, and then he schooled his face in a politely curious mask while he thanked Merlin he\u2019d spent so much time around Slytherins that he\u2019d learned some of their tricks. </p>\n<p>An important one was: stop talking. When confronted by someone who wanted to accuse you of any wrongdoing, you should keep your mouth shut as much as possible and let the other explain their motivations. </p>\n<p>And Harry made himself no illusions Dumbledore was here because even after all this time he apparently still kept a close eye on any location that was linked to Tom Riddle. </p>\n<p>So Tom really hadn\u2019t been exaggerating when he claimed Dumbledore had always despised him, and had even tried to erase his existence all together. </p>\n<p>\u201cMr Potter,\u201d Dumbledore said with a genial smile while his eyes carefully took in their surroundings. \u201cI am surprised to see you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as surprised as I am to run into you, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Harry said with a good-natured chuckle, and then he kept his mouth shut again while giving Dumbledore a curious look. </p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Dumbledore nodded a few times, leaning a little heavier on his cane, probably trying to draw even more attention to his advanced age. \u201cMight I ask what you are doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Harry replied with an agreeable nod. \u201cI\u2019d heard rumours the family that once lived here were parselmouths, so I decided to take a look around.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, it stands to reason you\u2019d want to learn more about your unusual talents.\u201d Dumbledore took a few steps closer to Harry. \u201cWhere did you hear these rumours, though? The family that once lived here has been dead for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegulus Black,\u201d Harry said without hesitation. \u201cReggie came across a mention of the Gaunt family being parselmouths in some book in his library.\u201d Harry was very proud of himself for coming up with that answer as quickly as he had. Regulus hated Dumbledore, for his biased treatment of Slytherins and his crusade against dark magic, and Dumbledore was well aware of this, so Harry doubted Dumbledore would ever bother to check with Regulus if Harry had spoken the truth. </p>\n<p>\u201cOne can find many secrets in books long forgotten,\u201d Dumbledore said mysteriously, and Harry had to put some real effort into not rolling his eyes. \u201cSome of those secrets had better be left forgotten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded politely but otherwise didn\u2019t respond. </p>\n<p>Silence stretched out between them, probably an attempt by Dumbledore to see if he could get Harry to break down into a nervous confession of whatever Dumbledore thought he\u2019d done wrong now. But Harry was no longer a student, hadn\u2019t been one in a long time, and Harry had never held Dumbledore on a pedestal like his parents had done, so the old headmaster had no power over him. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you find anything noteworthy here?\u201d Dumbledore finally asked when it became clear Harry wasn\u2019t going to give him what he wanted. </p>\n<p>\u201cLots of ivy,\u201d Harry said with a nod towards the wall of green behind him. \u201cAnd a few dangerous wards with some serious dark magic. I didn\u2019t linger, too afraid I might trigger something worse.\u201d </p>\n<p>At Hogwarts, Harry had been a mediocre student, because he honestly couldn\u2019t care much about anything other than Care for Magical Creatures and Quidditch. He\u2019d shown some talent for Defence against the Dark Arts, but he\u2019d never really explored that since he didn\u2019t think he needed it since he refused to even consider becoming an Auror like James Potter. So as far as Dumbledore knew, Harry wasn\u2019t a very talented wizard, especially not when it came to things like wards and curses. </p>\n<p>What Dumbledore forgot to take into account was that Harry had gone into business with Severus Snape early in his career, and Severus wanted to protect his investments and thus he\u2019d instructed his young business partner in all manner of important magic he should command while travelling around the world looking for dangerous creatures. And thus, under Severus\u2019 more than strict tutelage, Harry became quite proficient in defence, warding, curse-breaking and much more. </p>\n<p>Dumbledore chuckled, as though Harry had just told a funny joke. \u201cYes, sticking your nose into places it doesn\u2019t belong can get you into more trouble than you could have foreseen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth,\u201d Harry agreed, keeping up his act of clueless student that Dumbledore expected of him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell then, my boy, perhaps you should hurry home.\u201d Dumbledore stepped to the side as though to allow Harry passage through the overgrown garden path. </p>\n<p>Conceited prick. Harry had never had personal issues with Dumbledore, because Dumbledore had always simply ignored him. But he\u2019d heard more than enough complaints from his Slytherin friends, and now that he was confronted with Dumbledore sticking his nose into Harry\u2019s business, Harry could see for himself what a manipulative old man the headmaster really was. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Harry said mildly as he walked past Dumbledore. \u201cI could do with a cup of tea after all this excitement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive my best wishes to your parents, Harry.\u201d Dumbledore kept up his act of kindly old headmaster all the way to the moment Harry apparated away. </p>\n<p>Wasting no time the moment he got home, Harry opened the suitcase and climbed inside. </p>\n<p>Tom rushed towards him, scales sliding loudly across the stone floor, and he looked Harry over top to bottom. \u201cDid you get it? Are you all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it,\u201d Harry said with a sigh and he pulled a wooden folding chair closer and sank down into it. Harry fished the ring out of his pocket and held it up for Tom to see while he told his friend exactly what had happened. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat old bastard,\u201d Tom said with a terrible hiss, yellow eyes narrowing. \u201cHe must have had the Gaunt shack magically monitored for any intruders, thinking perhaps that if I ever appeared again I might check it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Harry agreed while Tom flicked his tongue at the ring a few times, trying to see if it was still a horcrux. \u201cIs there magic we can use to see if this still has a piece of your soul in it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, a ritual,\u201d Tom explained while dipping his head in thought. \u201cBut knowing that Dumbledore was snooping around one of my horcruxes, however accidentally, does make me nervous. Perhaps we should get the diary as soon as we can, and perform any detection rituals afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d Harry said with a nod, putting the ring back in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll floo Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chapter 10</p>\n<p>Harry kneeled in front of his fireplace, threw in a handful of floo powder and called out, \u201cBlackcurrant Cottage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco and his wife Astoria lived in a \u2018cottage\u2019 on the Malfoy ancestral grounds. It was a house that dwarfed most other wizarding dwellings, with seven bedrooms, four reception rooms and a large conservatory, but to the Malfoys it was a teeny, tiny cottage, at least compared to their main mansion. Draco had certainly whined about it often enough when he first moved in there after he married Astoria, how he suddenly had to make do with no space at all. It was Astoria who had insisted upon separate living quarters when she married him, to wean Draco off his parents\u2019 direct influence and whenever Draco started complaining she merely gave him an incredibly fond yet exasperated smile. </p>\n<p>A house-elf answered the floo call and Harry requested to speak to the master of the house. Draco appeared a mere minute later, which was a first because usually he made any floo-callers wait for at least ten minutes before showing up to take the call. Harry had once waited for twenty minutes before severing the call in frustration and simply apparating to Draco\u2019s cottage to talk to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Draco panted, as though he\u2019d ran all the way to the fireplace. \u201cHarry! I\u2019ve been trying to contact you for days and days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was abroad,\u201d Harry said in a vaguely amused tone at seeing Draco so flustered. His perfectly styled hair even had a few strands escaping from its usual stranglehold.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Draco waved Harry\u2019s comments away. \u201cBlaise told me eventually. Listen, I need your help. An Augurey has taken up residence in the woodland behind the cottage and it keeps wailing and wailing since it\u2019s been a very wet spring. Astoria keeps bursting into tears throughout the day. She\u2019s very sensitive to their cries. It\u2019s been a depressing week to be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if on cue, a mournful wailing could be heard in the background. </p>\n<p>Draco glanced over his shoulder. \u201cYes, we know it\u2019s going to rain, you bloody bird. Shut up already!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry had a fist pressed to his lips to keep from bursting out in laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll come get him,\u201d he easily agreed. \u201cBut I need a favour in return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, what do you need?\u201d Draco said without hesitation. He was a Slytherin after all, well accustomed to trading favours. </p>\n<p>Harry hesitated. Floo connections weren\u2019t always secure. \u201cMake some room and I\u2019ll step through right away.\u201d Harry summoned his backpack with a simple gesture of his hand and walked through the green flames into the entrance hall of Blackcurrant Cottage. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I want in return is very sensitive in nature and requires the utmost discretion,\u201d Harry whispered, leaning a little closer to Draco. </p>\n<p>At once, Draco perked up, eyes growing wide while he gave Harry an expectant look. During his sixth year, when Harry had slowly started to socialize with the Slytherins, Harry had quickly discovered that Draco Malfoy was the absolute gossip king of Hogwarts. The boy thrived on learning everything and anything he could about every single person in the whole world. So Harry knew exactly what he was doing by emphasizing the importance of what he was about to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father has an old, muggle diary in his possession,\u201d Harry whispered right into Draco\u2019s ear. \u201cIt was given to Abraxas by an old schoolmate named Tom Riddle. I need that diary, Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scrunching his eyebrows up in a thoughtful frown, Draco gave Harry a searching look. \u201cWhy would my father hold onto a muggle diary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Riddle cursed it and turned it into a very dangerous artifact. I need it now to help save someone\u2019s life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Draco\u2019s grey eyes were positively piercing while he stared at Harry. </p>\n<p>The Augurey wailed again, long and slow. </p>\n<p>Releasing a frustrated groan, Draco finally nodded his head. \u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019ll get that book for you, as long as you get that blasted bird out of here right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said with a cheerful smile, not at all put off by the sound of an Augurey. If anything, hearing their calls made Harry feel warm with nostalgia. Newt had always kept a few Augureys he\u2019d rescued over the years and hearing them call out reminded Harry of all the times he\u2019d spent with his old mentor. </p>\n<p>Harry found the Augurey in an oak tree right behind the cottage. It looked more bedraggled than Augureys usually did, and Harry quickly realized why. The poor thing was suffering from a serious chizpurfle infestation. Chizpurfles were tiny parasites that fed on magic from things living and dead. It was probably the reason the Augurey had moved so close to Draco\u2019s home. It needed help to get rid of the parasites.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mate. Usually I\u2019d let you lose in my suitcase but I cannot risk a chizpurfle infestation while my friend Tom is down there.\u201d Chizpurfles were greedy little parasites. They\u2019d eat a large, magical creature like a basilisk alive. Harry rummaged around in his backpack until he found a shrunken wire cage, which he enlarged with a flick of his wand. He opened the door and gestured at it. \u201cI promise to get that infestation dealt with right away. You\u2019ll be good as new in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Augurey gave Harry various curious looks, but wasn\u2019t so easily swayed by Harry\u2019s sweet promises. Eventually Harry summoned a field mouse, killed it by snapping its tiny neck and placed the offering inside the cage. That did the trick and the Augurey spread its grey wings and soared down to the ground where it hopped inside the cage to devour the mouse. </p>\n<p>Right after Harry closed the door and levitated the enclosure, Draco stepped out of the cottage, waving a small, black book. \u201cGot it! I had to ask a house-elf for help, but I found it eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gladly accepted the book and immediately tucked it away inside his backpack before hauling the whole thing over his shoulder. And not a second too soon, because a large shadow grew closer and closer in the overcast sky. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh fuck,\u201d Harry muttered while Draco winced beside him. </p>\n<p>An enormous Abraxan touched down on the grass a few yards away, carrying Charis Yaxley-Lestrange, Bellatrix\u2019s oldest child. Charis was almost a decade older than Harry and Draco so they never encountered her at Hogwarts, but Harry had heard plenty of stories of how she\u2019d ruled over Slytherin house with a very eager wand. As rumour had it, Charis was just as talented at casting curses as her mother had always been. </p>\n<p>And since James Potter had helped put Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange behind bars, Charis naturally had it out for Harry. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Draco whispered while Charis glared at them over her nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize she was here today since mother is away for the afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charis Yaxley-Lestrange enjoyed spending time with her aunt Narcissa, as they both shared a passion for Abraxan. She looked a great deal like her mother Bellatrix, with the same hooded eyes, though hers were brown instead of the usual Black family grey. \u201cAnd what brings the most useless of Potters here today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s here on my behalf,\u201d Draco was quick to say, looking rather pinched as he glared at his cousin. Harry knew from Draco\u2019s many complaints that Charis hadn\u2019t ever treated him with kindness either but enjoyed bullying him when Narcissa wasn\u2019t looking. \u201cThere was an Augurey that bothered Astoria. Harry\u2019s come to get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Harry agreed, warily watching how Charis moved her hand closer and closer to the wand on her hip. \u201cRight after this I\u2019ve got a meeting with my father.\u201d Which was bullshit, of course, but Harry thought it might be a good idea to remind Charis who his father was and what he would do if someone hurt his only son. Well, Harry thought James would avenge him if someone did him in. Probably. Even if only to defend the Potter name instead of Harry the freaky parselmouth himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to hurt you, you sad little boy,\u201d Charis said with a bit of a cackle and at once she aimed her wand at the Augurey. \u201cBut no one will care if I hurt that stupid bird.\u201d And with that she cast a silent spell and a sickly yellow light flew towards the caged bird beside Harry.</p>\n<p>Much to Harry\u2019s surprise, Draco all but threw himself in front of the Augurey so the magic hit him instead. Both Draco and Charis released simultaneous screams, Draco from pain and Charis from shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cDobby!\u201d Harry yelled, summoning Draco\u2019s house-elf at once. \u201cGet the Healer. Draco\u2019s been hurt. Badly.\u201d Once the house-elf popped away again, Harry crouched beside a groaning Draco. \u201cWhat the hell did you do that for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco released a pained chuckle. \u201cSo I could tell mother what Charis did. I\u2019m sick and tired of always walking on eggshells around her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charis stared down at them from her position on the Abraxan, mouth opened and cheeks pale. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t tell Cissy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I would,\u201d Draco whispered through gritted teeth. \u201cMother may be fond of you, cousin, but she would fight a dragon with her bare hands to keep me safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t hold back a small, amused smile. That did describe Narcissa Malfoy rather well, as far as he knew. </p>\n<p>Dobby led an older woman out of the cottage who was carrying a large potions bag. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d Draco said as he blinked up at Harry. \u201cYou don\u2019t want Mother to find you here, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said, patting Draco carefully on his shoulder. \u201cFor saving the Augurey. But please do give me a bit of warning next time you decide to impersonate a Gryffindor.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco snorted in response just as the Healer reached them. The Healer started pouring various potions down Draco\u2019s throat at once and Harry, studiously ignoring Charis\u2019 unrelenting glare, quickly fled into the cottage to use the floo. </p>\n<p>Once he stumbled out of the fireplace in his own home Harry released a relieved sigh. Then he pulled out his wand and conjured his Patronus. The huge, silvery stag gave him a curious look. \u201cGo to Blaise and tell him Draco\u2019s been injured and he could use some cheering up. Also tell him Draco may or may not have a brain tumour that\u2019s turning him into a Gryffindor because he just risked his life to save a bloody bird just to spite his least favourite cousin.\u201d</p>\n<p>The moment the stag disappeared through the walls, Harry released an enormous sigh. Fucking Draco and his idiotic behaviour. Then he remembered the caged Augurey he was still holding. Shit, he did not want a chizpurfle infestation in his home. Harry quickly carried the bird out into the garden and summoned his potions bag from his suitcase. He always kept treatments for pretty much all types of magical parasites on hand, because you never knew when you suddenly needed them. He opened the correct bottle and with his wand spread the potion out across the Augurey. That would take care of the majority of the pests, and after a repeat treatment the next day the whole lot should be eradicated. Harry released the Augurey who immediately flew to the apple tree in the back of Harry\u2019s yard. \u201cJust stay put, mate. I\u2019ll give you the next treatment tomorrow.\u201d </p>\n<p>The Augurey started wailing at once, since dark clouds were gathering on the horizon and Harry let that gloomy sound calm him down. </p>\n<p>Just as the first fat raindrops fell Harry went back inside his home and lowered himself inside his suitcase. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Tom asked eagerly as he came sliding out of the temperate mountain habitat. He\u2019d really taken a liking to swimming in the lake there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d Harry pulled the black book from his backpack and turned it over in his hands. On the back the name T.M. Riddle was embossed in faded gold print. \u201cNot sure if it still has your soul or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fairly simple ritual to find that out,\u201d Tom offered and then proceeded to tell Harry what to do. It involved drawing a simple ritual circle, adding the appropriate runes, placing the object inside and casting a few charms. </p>\n<p>Harry managed it without any problems and within moments they learned that neither the diary or the ring held any pieces of soul. </p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s grin was wide and toothy. \u201cThat\u2019s excellent news. That means I won\u2019t have to go through the very painful ritual of reuniting my soul pieces by myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry agreed, a warm feeling erupting in his chest when realizing how close they were to turning Tom back into a human. \u201cNow all we have to do is wait for Barty to get back to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could hunt some more spiders in the meantime,\u201d Tom suggested with a tilt of his massive head. \u201cMight as well make use of this form while we still have access to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \u201cMight as well,\u201d he agreed easily enough.</p>\n<p>And that is what they did. Two days later Harry booked a portkey that would take them to Sumatra, Indonesia, where a very large colony of Acromantulas lived that was open to hunting year round. They used the same tactics as they\u2019d done before, and this time they managed to kill well over fifty spiders in one fell stroke. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll never have to work a day in my life again,\u201d Harry mused as he started winding up the spiders\u2019 silk. </p>\n<p>Tom was gliding around the forest, giving every single dead spider a smug look. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019d be happy to retire this early in your life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Harry agreed with a chuckle. He couldn\u2019t imagine not travelling anymore, not going out to rescue animals and collect rare potions ingredients. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to know that I can choose only what I want to do from now on, instead of having to always worry about money.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom gave an agreeable nod. \u201cThat is most certainly true. I\u2019m looking forward to buying a small home for myself and living out my human days in peace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of gold to do so,\u201d Harry said with a laugh as he started on collecting venom. It took him most of the day to process and collect all the spider carcasses and it was getting dark by the time Harry gathered the last of the bodies so he could store them inside his suitcase. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Tom suddenly cried out as he came rushing towards Harry through the undergrowth. \u201cBehind you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned around in surprise and suddenly there was only darkness and needle like pricks all around his torso. Thankfully, Harry still had his wand in his hand and on instinct he called out, \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d The memories that swam to the forefront of his mind weren\u2019t of him spending time with Luna, Hagrid and Newt as they studied animals together, or of earning his Magical Zoology mastery, as they usually were. No, the things he saw in his mind\u2019s eye as the silvery stag burst forth were images of Tom and their adventures together so far. </p>\n<p>The stag lowered its head and pierced a thin, black thing with its silvery antlers. The thing reared itself up, resembling a sentient cloak that squirmed against the barrages of Harry\u2019s Patronus. And then Tom was there, mouth opened wide, fangs glistening with venom as it bit down on the black creature until it stopped moving altogether. </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin\u2019s saggy balls,\u201d Harry said when he finally caught his breath as he sat on the forest floor. \u201cI think you just killed a lethifold. I didn\u2019t even think that was possible. Seriously, this is the first time anyone has killed one. I need to write this down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom slowly spat out the lifeless black beast and gave Harry a worried look. \u201cAre you all right? You\u2019re bleeding. I can smell it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry waved his worries away as he pushed himself to his feet. \u201cYou do not understand, Tom. Until this moment people assumed lethifolds were unkillable. Yet you just killed it with your venom. This is huge, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom glared down at the dead lethifold for a moment and then turned away from it. \u201cYes, this is going to help wizard-kind so much, isn\u2019t it. Just carry a basilisk around with you the next time you find yourself in an Indonesian jungle and you won\u2019t have to worry about lethifolds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry burst out in laughter, mostly at Tom\u2019s utterly snooty tone. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s not a very practical solution, I agree. But academically, this really is an amazing discovery.\u201d And before Tom could protest, Harry levitated the dead lethifold into the suitcase and locked it in an empty trunk with every locking charm he knew. Just in case the lethifold wasn\u2019t as dead as they assumed. Harry would take great pleasure in studying the creature later and he was quite sure Severus and Luna would want to take a good look at it as well, just for curiosity\u2019s sake. Heck, probably everyone he knew would want a look at such a scary beast now that it was safe to do so. </p>\n<p>Tom gently nudged Harry with his nose. \u201cWill you please tend to your wounds now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all right.\u201d Harry got some healing potions and salves and carefully inspected his chest after he pulled off his shirt. The lethifold\u2019s teeth had left behind a whole row of slowly bleeding small holes on both his chest and back. It really had tried to devour Harry whole. Not for the first time in his life, Harry was very grateful Severus had taken the time to teach him the Patronus charm. </p>\n<p>Once they returned to Harry\u2019s cottage in Hogsmeade, the first thing Harry did was shoot off a Patronus to Severus and Luna. \u201cHey, I caught a lethifold. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s dead. Want to come have a look?\u201d</p>\n<p>Naturally, word spread quickly and instead of having two friends over, Harry found himself with a house full of guests. Severus was there, as were Luna and Rolf. Ron and Hermione had shown up, as had Hyacinth and her husband Rupert Longbottom. Blaise was chatting with Regulus and Barty right before Sirius and Remus arrived. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really have a lethifold?\u201d Sirius asked with wide, disbelieving eyes. \u201cNo joke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo joke,\u201d Harry said solemnly. \u201cIt tried to eat me, had me half devoured already when I managed to cast a Patronus charm. And then Tom came charging and bit the thing and killed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTom?\u201d Sirius asked with an uncertain look. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe not-basilisk?\u201d Harry gestured towards the suitcase, which stood tucked away against the dark fireplace. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a basilisk?\u201d Sirius asked, now sounding just a tad panicked. </p>\n<p>Harry sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s a wizard who got stuck as a basilisk. Long story. We\u2019re turning him back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus made a throaty sound of disbelief while he turned his nose up at Sirius\u2019 sudden look of intrigue.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, show us the beast then,\u201d Severus said, sipping a tumbler of fire whiskey.</p>\n<p>Harry stepped up to the trunk and placed his wand on the lid. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s dead, but just in case\u2026everyone who can cast a Patronus, keep your wands at the ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s dead?\u201d Hermione asked, voice high and tight. She quickly pulled her wand out, holding it in an unsteady grip. </p>\n<p>\u201cBloody Gryffindors,\u201d Severus muttered, his look one of utmost contempt while he aimed his wand at the trunk.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d Harry said while he started unlocking the trunk. It had better be. If it wasn\u2019t, Harry was kicking it straight down into the suitcase so Tom could bite it again, harder this time. </p>\n<p>When Harry very carefully opened the trunk, no living black shroud came flying out. Inside the trunk Harry found the beast lifeless, just as he expected. He levitated it out and up and around the room sounded many exclamations of awe and shock. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou actually got a lethifold, you mad lad,\u201d Sirius said with a bark of laughter. He ran a hand through his greying hair as he leaned over for a closer look. </p>\n<p>Everyone eventually dared to approach the almost mythical beast. Luna stood beaming at Harry, though she did give him a brief, sad smile. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad it tried to eat you. I\u2019d have liked to meet it while it was still alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned the beast over, so it\u2019s very wide mouth fell open, showing off multiple rows of very fine and very sharp teeth. \u201cAre you sure, Luna dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s dead,\u201d Rolf said with a laugh as he wrapped his arm around his wife\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love to meet Tom,\u201d Luna then said, blinking large, blue eyes at him. </p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. He knew Tom wouldn\u2019t purposefully hurt any of Harry\u2019s loved ones, but he was unwilling to risk it. One misplaced look, and Luna would be dead. \u201cWhen he\u2019s a man again. It won\u2019t be long now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Luna happily agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll all meet him soon enough I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>People mingled and chatted for an hour or two more during this impromptu reunion of Harry\u2019s favourite people in the whole world. Right as people got up to leave, Barty sidled closer to Harry, glancing over his shoulder to make sure his husband was otherwise occupied. Barty quickly pressed a small scroll into Harry\u2019s hand before taking a step back. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the ritual you need,\u201d Barty said in a quick whisper, glancing around multiple times, but Reggie was arguing with Sirius and seemed none the wiser of his husband\u2019s illicit activities. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Barty,\u201d Harry said with an utterly grateful smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll use it first thing in the morning.\u201d </p>\n<p>This was it, Harry noted with a huge swell of happiness. They finally had a way to turn Tom back into a man.</p>\n<p>Chapter 11</p>\n<p>Tom was unexpectedly quiet after Harry showed him the scroll with the ritual. \u201cYou said there were a few more Acromantula colonies that we could hunt, correct?\u201d Tom finally whispered as Harry looked at him in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d Harry opened the scroll and read over the ritual again. It wasn\u2019t even that complicated. It required a few ingredients he\u2019d have to buy, but that wouldn\u2019t take him more than an hour trip to Diagon Alley. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen let\u2019s use this form as long as we still have it,\u201d Tom suggested, some eagerness finally showing in his voice. \u201cLet\u2019s hunt a few more colonies while we still can. I\u2019ve been a basilisk for so long it hardly matters if I turn back tomorrow or next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave Tom a dubious look, very surprised Tom wasn\u2019t jumping at the opportunity to turn back into himself right away. Then again, Tom did have a very good point about hunting Acromantulas. Without a convenient basilisk, it was impossible to hunt that many giant man-eating spiders at a time. Whenever Harry went hunting by himself he\u2019d get one spider, perhaps two if he was very lucky and the wind wasn\u2019t too strong. Getting a few dozen in a day was unheard of unless you went out with a huge team of experienced hunters. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big colony on Bali,\u201d Harry said, already calculating which portkeys they\u2019d have to take. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an invasive one in Vietnam. During the war the wizards in North Vietnam released a few adult Acromantulas in the jungles there to help with the war effort. Those monsters grew fat on American soldiers and populated a huge stretch of jungle. Nowadays they\u2019re contained, but the Vietnamese ministry welcomes hunters with open arms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d Tom said and he did sound like he was genuinely interested in what Harry had to say. And yet Harry detected a certain tone in his voice that suggested Tom wasn\u2019t quite as happy as he pretended to be. Harry decided to give it a few days, see if Tom\u2019s mood improved. If not, Harry would ask him about it. He hated seeing Tom distraught in any way. </p>\n<p>It took them a day to get to Bali and their hunt went much the same as the previous one, without a surprise attack of a lethifold this time. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity,\u201d Harry said, standing beside his suitcase in which he\u2019d just dumped over 40 spider corpses while darkness fell around them. \u201cI\u2019d have loved to add another lethifold to my collection.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom was rooting around in the undergrowth. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of one. I can\u2019t smell anything, alas.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed his disappointment and climbed inside his suitcase for some dinner and a shower. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep watch tonight,\u201d Tom announced as he also slid inside the suitcase and curled up in the holding area, head poking in Harry\u2019s small apartment. \u201cJust in case one slithers inside and tries to eat you alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s much appreciated.\u201d Harry was sure his wards would keep out lethifolds. Well, mostly sure. He opened up a can of pork and beans and boiled some rice. Once his dinner was ready Harry sat down on his couch and ate in silence while Tom watched him quietly. </p>\n<p>It was strange how comfortable Harry felt around Tom. How much he\u2019d enjoyed having someone around all the time, even if that someone was currently stuck as an enormous murder serpent. </p>\n<p>Not for the first time Harry regretted that part of his profession. Harry loved travelling, seeing all parts of the world, but he knew all too well that doing so was a lonely existence. None of Harry\u2019s previous partners had felt any desire to join him on the road, unfortunately. But now that Harry had got to spend a few weeks with a companion, however strange that companion might be, Harry knew with certainty that any romantic partner would want to travel with him in the future. </p>\n<p>It was a pity Tom was so old already. Harry was sure that if Tom had been around Harry\u2019s age, give or take a decade, Harry would have proposed to him the second he turned back into a man. Harry didn\u2019t even know what Tom looked like as a man, but that hardly mattered. Tom was clever and devious and had a wicked sense of humour and loved wandering the jungles of the world as much as Harry did. </p>\n<p>Tom was damned near perfect as a potential romantic partner, save for the fact that Tom was well over 80 years old. </p>\n<p>Well, Harry mused as he put his empty plate on the coffee table and leaned back in the couch. They could always remain friends. \u201cTom,\u201d Harry said as he leaned his head back and closed his eyes, tired of breaking down spider bodies all day. \u201cOnce you\u2019re back to yourself, I\u2019d love it if you still joined me in my travels.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be an old man,\u201d Tom pointed out carefully. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo? Old men can still travel. We\u2019ll add a comfortable bed for you, make some adjustments in the bathroom if needed, and you\u2019d be set.\u201d Harry cracked an eye open and gave Tom a hopeful look.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019d love to see some more of the world through my human eyes.\u201d Tom blinked his large, yellow eyes at Harry in emphasis. </p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cSo that\u2019s a deal. We\u2019ll be travel buddies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d Tom replied in a quiet voice. Yeah, Harry was sure something was bugging Tom but he obviously wasn\u2019t ready yet to talk about it. </p>\n<p>They travelled to Vietnam the following day and the day after that they arrived at the Acromantula colony. Harry dove down on his broom and Tom burst out of the suitcase, killing dozens of the beasts instantly. They had that little routine down perfectly nowadays. </p>\n<p>\u201cTom!\u201d Harry yelled just as all the remaining Acromantulas had fled while the dead ones dropped down around them. \u201cShield your eyes!\u201d </p>\n<p>There, halfway up the tree, was a bundle wrapped in spider silk that was moving faintly. Harry mounted his broom, flew up and carefully cut the bundle loose. He levitated it to the ground and used cutting charms to open the sticky spider silk. For a few long moments Harry thought it might be a human child, since it had about that shape and size, but when he finally opened up the top of the silk bundle he saw that it was a demiguise. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d Harry muttered. The demiguise had its eyes closed and was hardly conscious, but it was breathing and occasionally twitching its body.</p>\n<p>Tom remained at a safe distance, his third eyelids clouding his yellow eyes. \u201cIs that a human?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, a demiguise. It\u2019s injured.\u201d Harry aimed his wand at his backpack and summoned his potions bag. He rummaged through it and then sighed in frustration. \u201cTom, do you know what would work against Acromantula venom? I don\u2019t have any antivenom in stock.\u201d Which was a bit of an oversight seeing as Harry had been hunting the beasts over the last two weeks. Ugh, sometimes Harry really got tired of being an impulsive, reckless Gryffindor.</p>\n<p>\u201cPhoenix Tears,\u201d Tom yelled back, still carefully keeping a distance. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any of those, either!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom slithered a little closer, eyes still clouded. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure I know how to brew a quick and basic antivenom that would work. If I tell you what to do, can you brew it? I\u2019m rather lacking in hands at the moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckled and started removing the rest of the silk from the demiguise. \u201cSeverus will claim otherwise, I\u2019m sure, but I can manage to brew most potions just fine. I do most of my own brewing, at least all of my everyday potions.\u201d Harry picked up the demiguise and carried it inside the suitcase. Tom followed, eyes still carefully veiled. </p>\n<p>While Harry got his cauldron set up over the stove in his apartment, Tom gave him instructions from the doorway. The demiguise was resting on the couch, the sluggishly bleeding wounds on its abdomen clearly visible even through its thick pelt. It took almost an hour but then Harry had a potion that Tom assured him would deactivate most of the Acromantula venom in the demiguise\u2019 body. Harry gently raised up the demiguise\u2019s head and poured the potion in its mouth. With a little magic he helped the demiguise swallow. Next he gave it a general healing potion and a blood-replenishing potion and then he cleaned the wounds as best he could with an antiseptic potion. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Harry said, wiping his hands on a towel. \u201cThat\u2019s the best we can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom had been watching him with interest. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a demiguise before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFew people have,\u201d Harry agreed with a chuckle. \u201cThey are rather good at being invisible. I\u2019ve seen one or two before in the wild, from a distance before they disappeared. But Newt has told me plenty of stories about the few he\u2019s looked after during his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just then the demiguise blinked its eyes open and looked at Harry with a large, black gaze. Then it spotted Tom out of the corner of its eyes, and it released a shriek before turning invisible instantly. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry said, reaching forwards with both hands to catch the demiguise but he only felt air. The demiguise was gone. </p>\n<p>\u201cI think it just ran over me into the holding area,\u201d Tom said with a few twitches of his large body. </p>\n<p>Harry sat back, bent his head and laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the suitcase open so it can escape. We\u2019ve got to get the dead spiders anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my eyes covered, just in case,\u201d Tom offered, which Harry thought was very kind of him. </p>\n<p>Breaking down the spiders kept Harry busy for the whole day, as usual, and by the time he\u2019d loaded up all the bodies he had a small mountain of dead spiders stacked in the desert habitat under heavy preservation charms. </p>\n<p>Harry cast a quick charm to count how many living things were currently in his suitcase. The answer came back as three. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s still here,\u201d Tom said as he came to a stop beside Harry. </p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Harry said, deeply amused by the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s probably hiding somewhere in one of the forests. We\u2019ll never find it. Though\u2026\u201d Harry briefly hurried inside his apartment, rummaged around in his pantry, and came back with a can of peaches. \u201cNewt told me they love peaches in heavy syrup. We might win its trust this way.\u201d Harry opened the can with a swish of his wand and placed it just inside his tropical jungle habitat, guessing that\u2019s where the demiguise was hiding. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just keep my eyes hidden for the time being,\u201d Tom said with a tired little sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncomfortable,\u201d he added quickly when he noticed Harry\u2019s concerned expression. \u201cBut it\u2019s just like looking through very dirty windows. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry, who used to wear glasses before he had his eyes corrected, knew only too well how annoying it was to look through dirty lenses. \u201cOr we could do the ritual and turn you back. That would solve the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shrugging his giant body, Tom turned away a little. \u201cOr we could continue hunting. Wasn\u2019t there another colony or two we could hit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTom,\u201d Harry said, stepping closer to Tom and placing a steady hand on his body. \u201cTom, why are you really stalling? We\u2019ve got more spiders than we can even handle. We really do not need more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Closing his eyes, Tom ducked his giant head, his whole body slumping down a little. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he said in a whisper so soft Harry had trouble hearing it. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry kept a comforting hand on Tom\u2019s body. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m well over 80. What if I turn back and die next week? What if I don\u2019t get to live at all?\u201d Tom\u2019s whole giant body shuddered and Harry stepped up to it and gave it a hug as best as he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr you might live for another 20 years. Or 40. Or 60. It\u2019s not unheard of. Look at Dumbledore. That man is over 130 and he\u2019s still around.\u201d Harry pulled back a little and heaved a deep sigh. He understood Tom\u2019s fears. It must be terrifying to have to make this choice, not knowing how soon death would come. \u201cNo one knows when their end comes,\u201d Harry whispered, leaning his forehead against the side of Tom\u2019s head. \u201cMy grandfather Fleamont Potter was a potioneer. A great man, funny and loving. I barely remember him because when I was 8 he blew himself up in his potions lab. Took half the house and my grandmother Euphemia with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tom muttered, finally opening his eyes again but keeping them shielded with his third eyelid. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it was a huge shock to our family,\u201d Harry said, remembering his grandparents with great fondness, but also with great sorrow. \u201cIt really messed up my dad, and right after the whole Pettigrew betrayal came to light. He was never the same after those incidents. Became a much harder and sterner man.\u201d</p>\n<p>They remained quiet for a few long moments before Harry spoke again. \u201cThe point is, we don\u2019t know when our time will come. Hell, I almost got eaten by a lethifold just last week. Not the first time either I barely escaped becoming someone\u2019s meal. I have a dangerous profession.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom nodded in understanding. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust know, Tom, that whatever time you have left, you\u2019re welcome to spend it with me if you so desire.\u201d Harry pulled back a little and gave Tom his most cheerful grin, even though his heart was filled with sorrow. \u201cOr not, if you\u2019re already tired of my awesome company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would think that, but as it turns out, spending time with a staunch Gryffindor isn\u2019t as bad as advertised,\u201d Tom said, also doing his best to lift the general melancholic mood. \u201cVery well. Let\u2019s turn me back. Tomorrow. I want you rested before attempting the ritual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d It was then that Harry realized they were still in Vietnam. \u201cHow about the day after tomorrow. Because we\u2019re still a long way from home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Tom replied with a toothy grin. </p>\n<p>The next morning, the can of peaches was empty but a quick charm showed that the demiguise was still somewhere in the suitcase. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I guess he\u2019s coming along for the ride, for now,\u201d Harry said after he just finished securing their plentiful spider bounty for the journey. </p>\n<p>\u201cShould we name it?\u201d Tom asked, looking slightly miserable with his third eyelids still up. \u201cWhat\u2019s its gender?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a good look,\u201d Harry admitted as he put one foot on the lowest rung of the ladder leading out of the suitcase. \u201cTheir genitalia are hidden by all their fur.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about Rene?\u201d Tom suggested with a mildly uncertain look. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat would work,\u201d Harry agreed and started climbing up the ladder. \u201cYou have fun with Rene. I\u2019ll get us home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Travelling back to Britain took a day, and by the time they arrived home Harry was too tired to hop to Diagon Alley for supplies for the ritual. He saved that for the next morning. He also stocked up on canned peaches because like most demiguises, Rene really seemed to enjoy them. Aside from all that sugary goodness Rene had an entire jungle to munch on in the tropical habitat. The space may be magically expanded but all the plants in there were real, just for such an occasion that Harry found himself with a herbivore guest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should do it in the basement of my cottage,\u201d Harry suggested once he lowered himself in the suitcase again. </p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you secure your home against any unexpected visitors, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Outside the Augurey, who seemed to have started calling Harry\u2019s apple tree home, released a long and slow wail to announce a coming rain storm. Harry smiled at the sound while he locked his floo and cast every security and privacy charm he knew on his doors and windows. That should do it. </p>\n<p>Once inside the basement, Harry got to work drawing the ritual circle and adding the herbs and crystals to the runes that he painted on the stone floor. Once he was all set, Harry opened the suitcase and called out to Tom. \u201cReady when you are!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom slid out of the suitcase and straight into the ritual circle where he coiled himself up as tightly as he could. It still barely fit and Harry couldn\u2019t help a chuckle at seeing Tom\u2019s disgruntled face. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have made it a bit bigger?\u201d Tom grumbled while he shifted first left and then right until he found a comfortable position. </p>\n<p>Harry waved towards the stone walls around them. \u201cNot really, no. I didn\u2019t have time to magically expand my basement so we have to make do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, carry on.\u201d Tom stopped moving and gave Harry an expectant look. </p>\n<p>For some strange reason, Harry got a bit of a lump in his throat. \u201cAll right.\u201d Harry raised the scroll, wand in hand, ready to start casting the necessary magic. \u201cJust for the record, I had a great time with you and I can\u2019t wait to meet you in person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Tom replied in a bit of a tight voice. </p>\n<p>Since there was no longer a reason to delay, Harry squared his shoulder, inhaled a deep breath, and started casting the magic. Harry wasn\u2019t really familiar with rituals, aside from a few simple ones he used to cast temporary wards or something. This was strong, heady magic, and Harry was glad that he had a powerful magical core. James Potter had more than once complained that Harry was wasting his magical potential by running after critters. Harry always ignored him, but he had to admit that being magically powerful did come in handy from time to time. </p>\n<p>Like when turning a basilisk back into a man. </p>\n<p>The magic grew while the air filled with the scent of ozone and Tom released a soft, grunting noise. Eventually Harry cast the final spell and looked at Tom expectantly. </p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s yellow basilisk eyes looked right back at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo that didn\u2019t work,\u201d Harry sighed, chest full of hot disappointment. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou did everything right, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Tom said in confusion. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll floo Barty.\u201d With a quick gesture at Tom to stay put, Harry rushed up the stairs, unlocked his floo and threw in some powder. \u201cGrimmauld Place!\u201d</p>\n<p>Usually Kreacher answered the floo, and Harry planned to ask for Barty so hopefully they could keep their conversation from Regulus. The last thing Harry wanted to see happen was Regulus putting a stop to their ritual. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it was Regulus himself who answered the floo. </p>\n<p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Harry tried to look at innocent as he could. \u201cIs Barty home? I just have a quick question for him. About demiguises. I found one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus narrowed his grey eyes and released a soft, knowing sigh. \u201cI know exactly what you two are up to, Harry Potter. Convince me that this murderer deserves to be a man again, and I\u2019ll get Barty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Crap, Harry didn\u2019t have time for this but he recognized that mulish look on Reggie\u2019s face and he knew there was no way he\u2019d get what he wanted without giving Regulus a proper answer. \u201cAll right. Tom\u2019s sorry. He really is. And he\u2019s well over 80 years old and he just wants to quietly retire and drink tea and read books. Those are the things he\u2019s missed. Not world domination. And we\u2019ve agreed that, his health permitting, we\u2019ll continue to travel together because we have a lot of fun, just the two of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reggie blinked a few times and tilted his head while he processed all that information. Then he sighed and gave a sharp nod. \u201cI\u2019m holding you accountable, Harry. If Riddle only thinks about becoming a Dark Lord, I\u2019m skinning you alive.\u201d Before giving Harry a chance to reply, Regulus turned around and yelled, \u201cBarty! Harry\u2019s in the floo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barty came storming down the staircase and all but skidded to a halt in front of the fireplace where he threw himself down on his knees. \u201cDid it work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cNo, and I\u2019ve got no clue why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Barty\u2019s face scrunched up in a thoughtful from. He didn\u2019t even seem upset that it hadn\u2019t worked. Then again, Barty liked nothing more than an academic challenge and this was exactly that. \u201cDid you leave anything out about the ritual?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head again. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid Riddle partake in any other rituals before the longevity one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was about to deny that until he remembered the horcruxes. Those counted as a ritual. Perhaps even a bit more than that. \u201cEr\u2026yeah, he did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the ritual?\u201d Barty asked, giving Harry a confused look as to why Harry seemed so reluctant to answer. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026er\u2026it was a horcrux ritual,\u201d Harry mumbled. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, what a real gentleman he is,\u201d Regulus said in scathingly mocking tone. \u201cHe used the murder he committed to split his own soul and create a horcrux. A real charmer, that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo horcruxes,\u201d Harry whispered, hanging his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Harry?\u201d Reggie said, with feeling. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that explains why the ritual didn\u2019t work,\u201d Barty mused, entirely unfazed by his husband\u2019s sudden anger. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing is, though, the objects no longer hold his soul,\u201d Harry said quickly, as though that information made up for the unspeakable things Tom had done. Horcruxes were a real taboo for a reason. \u201cWe checked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barty\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cBut the containers are still intact?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your answer,\u201d Barty concluded with a satisfied grin. \u201cThe souls may have returned to the body, but the containers are still whole. The only way to truly destroy a horcrux is to destroy the containers. Basilisk venom should work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry heaved a huge sigh of relief. \u201cThanks, Barty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Regulus said, jumping in shock. </p>\n<p>Barty also twitched violently. \u201cSomething just rushed past me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh fuck, Harry had left the suitcase open in the basement. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just a demiguise. Put out a can of peaches for now and I\u2019ll come get it later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Reggie looked about ready to skin Harry right there and then. \u201cTell me it\u2019s really a demiguise. Not a lethifold or worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really is a demiguise. Promise. His name is Rene.\u201d Harry pulled back from the floo. \u201cCanned peaches!\u201d And then he quickly closed the floo and locked it again. Rene would be fine. He hoped. At any rate, Harry had no time to worry about their unexpected guest because he had a basilisk to transform. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to destroy these,\u201d Harry said, all but throwing the diary and the ring at Tom. \u201cBite down on them during the ritual and it should work. Also, Rene escaped so once we\u2019ve got you back to your old self we have to go find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom looked like there were many things he wanted to say at that moment but he wisely kept his mouth shut and simply gave Harry a nod. </p>\n<p>Without wasting another minute, Harry got started on the ritual again, feeling a bit more confident now that he\u2019d already performed it once. Ten minutes of casting magic later, Tom bit down on his horcruxes and what followed was a rush of magic that shook Harry\u2019s cottage on its foundation. A huge cloud of smoke filled the basement and Harry quickly waved his wand around to clear the air. </p>\n<p>Once he was able to see again, and breathe again without coughing, Harry noticed that the basilisk was gone and a man lay in the middle of the ritual circle. </p>\n<p>A young man. Probably the age Tom would have been when he performed the ritual in the first place, which was somewhere in his twenties.</p>\n<p>Tom slowly sat up, stark naked, but Harry hardly noticed that. All he had eyes for was Tom\u2019s face, with its black, wavy hair, and his brown eyes and sharp cheekbones. </p>\n<p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d Harry blurted before he could stop himself. \u201cYou\u2019re hot!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chapter 12</p>\n<p>The brief, knowing smirk Tom gave him was quickly replaced with a look of vague disbelief as Tom pushed himself up from the ground and looked down his own body. </p>\n<p>Harry also couldn\u2019t stop staring at Tom. He really was a very attractive man. Tall and lean and grinning like a man possessed as he stepped up to Harry. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy wand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d For a second Harry had hoped Tom would perhaps want to touch him, hug him or even kiss him, but Harry understood that Tom probably had other priorities right now. Harry reached inside his wand holster and pulled out both their wands. He handed Tom his. </p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s eyes closed in obvious pleasure as he held his wand. Harry imagined that after all this time it must be very close to the first time any of them touched a wand that choose them. A huge magical rush that promised great and exciting things in the future. </p>\n<p>Next Tom aimed his wand at Harry, his expression giving nothing away while his eyes narrowed. </p>\n<p>Harry got a brief glimpse in his mind of Reggie\u2019s disappointed expression while he muttered about knowing all along Tom Riddle was bad news and why had Harry not simply believed Regulus when he had the chance. </p>\n<p>But Tom didn\u2019t cast any hexes or curses. Instead he used a bit of gentle magic to pull Harry closer until they were practically face to face. Harry was no short guy by any means, but Tom still had a few good inches over him. Tom slowly, as to give Harry time to move away, bent his head and brushed his lips across Harry\u2019s. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that for a while now,\u201d Tom whispered against Harry\u2019s mouth. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to take this further,\u201d Harry replied in an equally quiet voice. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got basilisk breath. Perhaps a shower first?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom threw his head back and laughed, and it was a wonderful sound, dark and deep. Harry grinned in reply and then led Tom up the stairs to the bathroom. He showed Tom where to find everything he needed, and then rummaged around in his own wardrobe for some simple clothes for Tom to wear for now. Tom was a very rich man, so they could visit Diagon Alley later and buy everything he needed. </p>\n<p>Tom gave him a cheeky wink before sliding the toothbrush Harry had given in in his mouth. Harry left him to it and decided to fulfil one of Tom\u2019s simple desires. He put the kettle on and brewed a large pot of Earl grey. He also fried up some eggs and bacon, and toasted some bread which he slathered with Molly\u2019s homemade butter and strawberry jam. </p>\n<p>By the time Tom entered the kitchen, clean and dressed, Harry had a small feast waiting for him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are amazing,\u201d Tom said, all but throwing himself into a chair at the kitchen table while Harry served him a steaming cup and a full plate. \u201cKeep this up and you\u2019ll never be rid of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckled as he sat down and tucked into his own lunch. </p>\n<p>Afterwards, as Harry placed the dirty dishes into the sink, a very satisfied Tom pressed himself against Harry\u2019s back and brushed a kiss across the back of Harry\u2019s neck. Harry turned around in his embrace and met Tom\u2019s lips with his own. Their kiss was long and slow and they explored each other with their tongues to their heart\u2019s content. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever gave you the idea I wanted to be rid of you?\u201d Harry asked as they finally pulled back. Tom had deep brown eyes, but Harry was sure he could see a fine sheen of gold over them still. </p>\n<p>Tom shrugged, ducking his head a little, though his smile bordered on being smug. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to assume anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to stay,\u201d Harry said, blunt as can be, because he wanted there to be no confusion on this subject. \u201cI enjoy your company. I\u2019d love for you to fuck me silly later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no objections to any of that,\u201d Tom said as he stepped away from Harry. \u201cThough I would like to go and get my affairs in order first and buy some necessities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry beamed at him. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s go to Diagon Alley!\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus had put all of Tom\u2019s earnings in Harry\u2019s vault, so while Tom opened up his own Gringotts account, Harry transferred Tom\u2019s share to his brand new vault. Tom withdrew a sizable bag of gold, looking like he could barely believe all this wealth was truly his. </p>\n<p>They stopped at Madam Malkin\u2019s where Tom got a basic wardrobe, and then at Flint and Sons \u2013 Cobblers, where Tom got two pairs of shoes. Next was Flourish and Blotts where Tom bought fairly new books on just about every subject. Which led to a quick stop at the luggage shop for an expanded trunk with special library features. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to catch up on all the new magical developments of the last five decades or so,\u201d Tom said with an eager gleam in his eyes. \u201cAnd this way I can easily take my books with me during our travels.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry merely nodded in response. His chest felt like it was glowing and he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever felt this happy before. Finally Harry had found a potential partner who wanted to live his lifestyle, who wanted to spend time travelling with him. It was more than Harry had ever dared to hope for and it made him feel so ridiculously ecstatic, Harry hardly knew what to do with himself. </p>\n<p>Tom visited a few more stores for a few more knickknacks, and Harry made a short trip to the grocers for some more canned peaches. He also picked up some canned pears, pineapple and cherries, just to see if those would help lure Rene back to their home through the floo. </p>\n<p>Just as they were about to call it a day and have some dinner in one of the little restaurants in Fantastic Alley, a very unwelcome voice sounded behind them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Potter, I heard some interesting stories about your latest quest,\u201d Albus Dumbledore said, leaning on his cane while he gave Harry a searching look. \u201cThat you caught and killed a lethifold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, that wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Harry said with a strained smile. He gestured at Tom standing beside him. \u201cMy friend here did the beast in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour friend\u2026\u201d Dumbledore stopped speaking, his face draining of all colour as he stared at Tom in absolute disbelief. \u201cTom\u2026 my boy\u2026 how\u2026\u201d Dumbledore bent down a little, releasing a pained groan, his free hand pressed to his chest while he leaned his entire weight on his cane. A passing woman rushed towards him and placed a hand on his elbow. </p>\n<p>\u201cHeadmaster, are you well? Do you perhaps need to sit down?\u201d the woman asked in obvious concern. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, just had a bit of a shock.\u201d Dumbledore pushed himself up again, though now his face looked a rather sickly white. </p>\n<p>\u201cI was cursed,\u201d Tom said, apparently eager to stave off any more questions from his despised former professor. They had decided along the way they would tell people the truth of what happened to Tom since it explained where he\u2019d been for so long and how he was still so young. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck as a basilisk for 60 years, hiding away in an Indian forest. Harry found me and helped me return to myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Harry, my dear boy,\u201d Dumbledore said with a tired sigh. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSaved a man\u2019s life,\u201d Harry said with a hard stare. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, Headmaster, we were just about to go and have dinner. Good day.\u201d And with that Harry turned on his heels while Tom did the same. They marched off without a backwards glance. </p>\n<p>They ended up in a little bistro named The Golden Goose, where they enjoyed generous portions of fish and chips, with a huge slice of chocolate cake for afters. They made small talk along the way, talking about countries they wanted to travel to and creatures they wanted to see. They studiously avoided talking about Dumbledore and that unwelcome confrontation, even though Harry was certain they hadn\u2019t heard the last of the headmaster just yet. </p>\n<p>Harry turned out to be right when they returned to Harry\u2019s cottage in Hogsmeade. In the backyard they heard the Augurey wail and Harry glanced up at Tom as he opened the garden gate so they could enter the yard. \u201cIt seems he wants to stay. We should probably name him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom peered up at the bedraggled grey bird up in the apple tree. \u201cHow can you even tell its gender?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe male\u2019s plumage is slightly more colourful than the female\u2019s,\u201d Harry said with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>That</i> is colourful plumage?\u201d Tom asked in disbelief. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very subtle.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t stop grinning at Tom\u2019s wide-eyed look. \u201cHow about Paul?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine by me.\u201d Tom turned towards Harry and stepped a little closer. \u201cHow about we let Paul practice the song of his people while I take you to bed and give you something you seemed to rather desperately want earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s,\u201d Harry agreed and brushed a kiss against Tom\u2019s lips, body heating with anticipation of what was to come. </p>\n<p>The backdoor banged open and a furious James Potter stood in the doorway. \u201cHarry James Potter, get inside! Now! And bring that criminal with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry could only gape at his father. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Harry muttered, and behind him Tom muttered the exact same thing. \u201cLet me do the talking,\u201d Harry said with a quick glance over his shoulder. \u201cHow the hell did he even get in here? The floo was locked.\u201d</p>\n<p>The answer to that question became clear the moment Harry and Tom stepped inside the living room. There stood Severus, face carefully blank. Severus was Harry\u2019s emergency contact and he was tuned into all of Harry\u2019s wards for this very reason. So Lily had probably begged her old friend to open the wards for them. And Severus being the secret drama queen that he was, wasn\u2019t about to miss some good old-fashioned Potter family dramatics, now live in Harry\u2019s living room. </p>\n<p>But Severus wasn\u2019t the only guest. Sirius and Remus stood beside Lily, looking as though they both regretted ever becoming friends with James in the first place. Against the opposite wall Regulus and Barty stood, looking very much as if they weren\u2019t sure what was going on and why they were there in the first place. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t answering your floo,\u201d Barty said with a bright smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to remind you to come get your pet,\u201d Regulus added with a bit of a scowl. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, nice to meet you.\u201d Barty gave a little wave in Tom\u2019s direction. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for your invaluable help,\u201d Tom replied with a polite nod. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs this an intervention?\u201d Harry asked as he glanced around the room while his father quietly fumed with his arms crossed tightly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Lily said, head tilted to convey some extra sympathy. \u201cWe\u2019re all here because we love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Harry said in a snippy tone. \u201cNow please all leave. I have plans for this evening.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here because you\u2019re housing a criminal and participated in some dubiously legal rituals to allow this man entry into the country,\u201d James finally said, voice almost a growl. Sirius sighed and rolled his eyes, seemingly not at all in agreement with what James was trying to pull. </p>\n<p>\u201cAccidentally turning yourself into a basilisk is not a crime,\u201d Harry snapped, unable to contain his rising anger. His father always had that effect on him. \u201cAnd me helping to turn him back to himself isn\u2019t against the law either!\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus gave Harry a very subtle yet very pointed look. Ah yes, Harry was on the verge of having full blown verbal diarrhoea and desperately needed to be stopped. Harry knew full well that the Slytherin code clearly stated that when confronted with an adversary, one should stop talking. But it seemed that being surrounded by his Gryffindor kin rubbed off more Gryffindor values on Harry than he wanted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about the student he murdered while he was at Hogwarts?\u201d James said, a challenge in his voice, daring Harry to deny that accusation. </p>\n<p>Harry did what he had to and kept his mouth shut, lips pursed tightly. In the corner of the room near the door Regulus could barely contain a smile and he quickly ducked his head. Tom, being well aware of the Slytherin code of conduct, also kept his mouth shut and merely looked at James with barely enough polite interest. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d James said, expression turning into one of triumph. \u201cGot nothing to say to that, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus cleared his throat. \u201cWas Mr Riddle ever officially accused of this crime?\u201d For some reason, this made Sirius grin widely and he beamed at Reggie with pride. Harry was briefly confused why Regulus would even want to speak up in Tom\u2019s defence, but then he remembered the Slytherin code of conduct once again. When confronted with hostile Gryffindors, Slytherins always banded together. Always.</p>\n<p>James gave Reggie a very snooty sort of look. \u201cNot to my knowledge. But Dumbledore was adamant that this man was behind the brutal murder of a girl at Hogwarts during his time as a student.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAh yeah,\u201d Barty said with a thoughtful frown. \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard about that incident. Didn\u2019t Hagrid do her in by accident via that man-eating spider he was illegally keeping as a pet? I\u2019m quite sure he was expelled for that very reason. He\u2019s told me about it often enough over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry had trouble to hide his laughter. Hagrid was well known for telling everyone the story of how he got Aragog in vivid detail, so it wasn\u2019t the least bit of a surprise that Barty knew of it.</p>\n<p>James\u2019 expression had turned completely sour, as though he was sucking on a lemon. \u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there. Dumbledore is certain this man is a murderer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the law clearly says that a man is innocent until proven guilty, Prongs,\u201d Sirius said, pushing himself away from the wall to stand beside James. \u201cIf you\u2019re really certain Dumbledore is right and this man has committed a crime then go and find evidence and bring him up on charges. But simply standing here accusing him of a crime someone else was already convicted for is wasting everyone\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>James squared his shoulders and got that haughty expression on his face he always did before laying into Harry for his poor life choices. \u201cThis has gone far enough, Harry. You\u2019ve abandoned your family, rejected our values and now you\u2019re shacking up with a criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took Harry everything he had not to rip into his father. Surprisingly, Harry didn\u2019t need to, because Severus did if for him. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds as though you\u2019re jealous of your own son, Potter,\u201d Severus said, smooth as can be with an entirely bored expression on his face. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s no surprise, since Harry is far more successful in his career than you are in yours. He makes more money, he gets more job satisfaction and he is much better regarded by the general public for his entertaining books and articles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you,\u201d James breathed, going for his wand. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I dare,\u201d Severus said, reaching for his own wand and aiming it at James. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, stop!\u201d Lily stepped between them, holding up both hands to try to calm the situation down. She had no success, but someone else did. </p>\n<p>\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Tom bellowed, making everyone, even Harry, jump. \u201cI have been a literal beast for 60 years and I still have better manners than you both. You are uninvited guests in Harry\u2019s home, yet here you are trying to duel in his living room. If you are so eager to do each other some serious damage, you will go outside and do it there. And with that I mean the street, not the yard. We don\u2019t want Paul to get injured because of your inability to control your emotions even as grown adults.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s Paul?\u201d Barty whispered, leaning over a little in Harry\u2019s direction. </p>\n<p>\u201cAn Augurey I rescued from Draco\u2019s woodland. He now lives in my apple tree,\u201d Harry whispered back with a chuckle. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Thanks.\u201d Barty was back to smiling now that he had another answer to one of his many questions he ran into on a day to day basis. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d James said, shoving his wand back in its holster and marching out of the room. He shouldered Severus to the side as he did so, but thankfully Severus let that slide and merely sneered in response. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Harry,\u201d Sirius said as he briefly stopped in front of Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he calms down.\u201d And with that, Sirius and Remus hurried after his friend. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Lily sighed while giving Harry a hug he didn\u2019t return. \u201cThink about what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked at his mother in genuine confusion. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going? I\u2019ve saved a man\u2019s life and I made a new friend. That\u2019s it. Whatever crawled up James Potter\u2019s arse has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The stern look Lily gave Harry in response was full of disappointment but Harry couldn\u2019t care less. He was done with orchestrating his life to his parents\u2019 wishes. He was his own man, plain and simple. </p>\n<p>When it became clear Harry wasn\u2019t going to apologize, Lily simply sighed and shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d And with that she disappeared after her husband. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said to Severus, who merely nodded in return and also left. </p>\n<p>Regulus gestured to the floo. \u201cGet your pet, Harry. It keeps creeping out Kreacher. His heart can\u2019t take much more of an invisible animal sneaking about and stealing his cabbages.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all right.\u201d Harry pulled on Tom\u2019s wrist while he stepped up to the floo. He picked up his backpack and made his way to Grimmauld Place. </p>\n<p>That is how Harry found himself stalking through the dark hallways of the Black ancestral townhouse with an opened can of peaches in his hand. \u201cRene, I promise you, the scary snake monster is gone. There\u2019s now a very nice and polite gentleman who is not going to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barty glanced at Tom. \u201cLooks like he might be a while. Want to see the library?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need to ask?\u201d Tom gave Barty a cheeky little smile and followed him to the next floor up. </p>\n<p>It was probably a good thing Reggie was busy comforting a very upset Kreacher, because Harry doubted he\u2019d have been as eager to let Tom inside one of the country\u2019s greatest private libraries. Even if Reggie had spoken in Tom\u2019s defence, he didn\u2019t yet seem quite eager to fully accept him. Harry figured Regulus wanted to wait and see what Tom would get up to in the coming weeks and months before making any final judgements on his character.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Rene. I know you love peaches.\u201d Harry sighed and put down the opened can. He reached in his backpack and got out the can of pears instead. \u201cLet\u2019s try these then.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until Harry opened a can of pineapple that he felt a small, invisible hand reached inside the can and grab a small, yellow chunk of fruit. \u201cAh, so you love pineapple even more than peaches.\u201d Harry grinned down at his new invisible friend. \u201cWell, come along then and you can have the whole can. Reggie, I found him! Open the floo!\u201d</p>\n<p>Carefully, with the can becoming emptier and emptier, Harry lured Rene back to his cottage. There was a moment of some confusion when Harry wasn\u2019t sure if Rene had followed him through the floo, but eventually the can of pineapple on Harry\u2019s coffee table moved on its own accord and Harry knew he\u2019d gotten his wayward friend home. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m closing the floo,\u201d Harry yelled at Reggie\u2019s face dancing in the green flames. \u201cI don\u2019t want Rene to slip through again. Tell Tom to apparate home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t mind that Tom was having a little fun with Barty in the library. Tom was a bibliophile who had been deprived of books for 60 years. Harry understood Tom had some catching up to do. While Rene kept snacking on the pineapple and the other cans of fruit Harry put out for him, Harry decided he might as well take a shower before turning in. He was exhausted by the day\u2019s events. </p>\n<p>As Harry stood under the warm spray massaging shampoo in his hair, the curtain drew back and Harry felt a hand on his shoulder. \u201cOh Rene,\u201d Harry said with an exaggerated sigh. \u201cWe must be careful before we are caught.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s chuckles were warm and deep as he squeezed Harry\u2019s wet shoulder. \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Harry said with a smile as he looked over his shoulder. Tom had already undressed himself and slipped right into the shower with him. \u201cHave fun with Barty?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Tom said, wrapping his arms around Harry, pressing himself to Harry\u2019s back. \u201cBut then I remembered that I could be having even more fun with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rinsed out his hair and then gave Tom an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m exhausted. Can we leave the fucking until tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tom leaned over to give Harry a soft kiss. \u201cHow about I give you a hand instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that\u2019s an excellent plan,\u201d Harry mumbled, returning Tom\u2019s kisses with eager touches of his tongue. They brought each other off with quick strokes of their hands and afterwards they dried off with a few charms and crawled into Harry\u2019s warm bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Harry asked as they lay cuddled together, naked bodies entwined. \u201cThis was your first day as a human again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tom chuckled and rubbed his nose through Harry\u2019s hair. \u201cIt\u2019s been rather surreal at times, I must admit. But I\u2019ve also felt happier than I ever have, I\u2019m sure. Overall\u2026today I\u2019ve been at peace.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave him a kiss in response and then let sleep claim him. </p>\n<p>They were rudely awakened the next morning with banging on the door. \u201cWhoever that is can fuck off,\u201d Harry muttered, pressing his face into his pillow with a groan. Beside him, Tom reacted much the same. And Harry was absolutely determined to ignore whoever that was. But then they started hacking away at his wards and that wouldn\u2019t stand. </p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell.\u201d Harry jumped up, grabbed his wand, summoned his robes and then hurried down the stairs. Tom was right there by his side as Harry ripped the front door open. </p>\n<p>James Potter stood outside the door, an absolutely glowing look of triumph on his face while a few Aurors Harry didn\u2019t know were trying to bring Harry\u2019s wards down without much success. </p>\n<p>\u201cTom Marvolo Riddle,\u201d James said, wand out and pointed straight at Tom. \u201cI hereby arrest you for the murder of Albus Dumbledore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chapter 13</p>\n<p>Once Ginny Weasley was old enough to understand why she was poor, her entire future changed. </p>\n<p>Her parents, Arthur and Molly Weasley, were loving, kind, hard-working but slightly naive people. When they\u2019d been expecting their third child and the Burrow needed expanding, they\u2019d gotten a loan from who they assumed was an honourable wizard. Unfortunately for them, Aloysius Nott was anything but. One might best describe him as a loan shark with a talent for writing creative contracts with exorbitant interest rates. </p>\n<p>That is how Arthur and Molly Weasley got stuck paying off a small loan for the rest of their lives. Arthur\u2019s already measly Ministry salary was stretched almost to the breaking point under these payments. The thing was that the contract was so obviously skirting the law that it probably wouldn\u2019t hold up in front of the Wizengamot. But to get it in front of the Wizengamot one needed a solicitor, and solicitors were far too expensive for the Weasleys to afford. </p>\n<p>When Ginny Weasley learned all this, she was determined to become the first ever solicitor in the Weasley family. Problem with this was that becoming a solicitor required a four year apprenticeship and those were not free. In fact, a law apprenticeship was amongst the most expensive of apprenticeships, aside from a Potions one. A master may decide to wave any apprenticeship fees if the student was exceptionally talented or otherwise benefited the Master in some ways, like having a important family name. </p>\n<p>Such had happened with a young but poor man named Severus Snape, who was so naturally talented that several Potioneers had actually offered Severus a salary to come work as their apprentice. This was practically unheard of. </p>\n<p>Ginny Weasley had no family name to fall back on, nor was she particularly talented in ways that stood out, aside from on the Quidditch pitch. </p>\n<p>It was her good friend Harry Potter who ultimately inspired Ginny. When Harry left Hogwarts he was determined to get a Mastery in Magical Zoology. But Harry\u2019s family refused to pay for it, so Harry used his other major talent, that of a Seeker, to fly for the Montrose Magpies for many years while he got his mastery. </p>\n<p>This, Ginny realized, was her one and only chance to save her family from financial doom. She put everything she had in becoming the best Quidditch player she could be in her final year at Hogwarts. She was Captain of the Gryffindor team and led them to victory in the Quidditch Cup. And when she applied to the Holyhead Harpies she was hired right out of Hogwarts as their new star Chaser. </p>\n<p>Ginny kept living at the Burrow and saved every knut she made. She even wrote articles about Quidditch for several newspapers and magazines, and she accepted a Spellington Broom Wax sponsorship, all to earn as much money as she could. After 4 long years she finally had enough to pay for a law apprenticeship. Ted and Andromeda Tonks accepted her as their new apprentice and taught her everything they knew.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to Ginny, however, someone had been keeping a very close eye on her career. What had started as an innocent crush on a pretty girl who looked particularly good while flying a broomstick at Hogwarts had eventually turned into something of an obsession. </p>\n<p>Theodore Nott, youngest child of Aloysius Nott, was a brand new solicitor who\u2019d apprenticed under his uncle Lambert Nott. He was also madly in love with Ginny Weasley, even if he\u2019d yet to speak a word to her. </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until Theo, as he preferred to be called, ran into Ginny in the bowels of the ministry that he finally spoke to her. And the words he said to Ginny were definitely enough to make her notice him at once. </p>\n<p>Theo said, \u201cSue me, Ginevra.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Ginny had. She\u2019d dragged Theo and his entire family in front of the Wizengamot and gotten that illegal contract nullified at once. Not only that, but Aloysius Nott had to pay back any gold, aside from the loan\u2019s principal, he\u2019d taken from the Weasley family over the years, plus a little extra as a fine.</p>\n<p>And Theo had loved every second of it. </p>\n<p>What followed was a whirlwind romance born on the Wizengamot floor. They flirted while they defended clients, they got hot and bothered while they listened to each other\u2019s final remarks, and within a few weeks they were fucking and five months later they were married. </p>\n<p>Nowadays they ran a successful law practice called Nott &amp; Weasley \u2013 Solicitors. Ginny had insisted on keeping her own name. She\u2019d worked far too hard to just give it up, and Theo honestly couldn\u2019t care less as long as she agreed to become his wife. </p>\n<p>This is why Harry ended banging on the door of their lovely farmhouse in Ottery St Catchpole early in the morning. </p>\n<p>Theo opened the door, clearly in the middle of getting dressed, his shoes untied, his tie undone. \u201cHarry? What\u2019s the emergency?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leaned one hand against the doorpost while he panted. \u201cI need your help. Or Ginny\u2019s. Or both.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m expected in the Wizengamot in half an hour, but Ginny has office duty today so she can see you,\u201d Theo said, opening the door further to let Harry in. </p>\n<p>Ginny came walking down the stairs, wearing a black pantsuit. Once Ginny had been officially sworn in as a solicitor, Hermione had taken her shopping in the muggle world and Ginny had fallen in love with the sharply cut pantsuits she found there. She wore nothing else to the office these days. </p>\n<p>Ginny raised a single eyebrow as she stopped in front of her friend. \u201cHarry? What\u2019s going on? Please don\u2019t tell me that lethifold you caught ate someone. That\u2019s going to be a challenge to defend in front of the Wizengamot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Harry shook his head and finally felt like he could breathe again. Ginny was an amazing solicitor. She would be able to help Tom. \u201cMy dad has lost his mind and he\u2019s arrested my boyfriend for Dumbledore\u2019s murder even though I\u2019m sure the old man just died of a heart attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ginny blinked. \u201cOkay, tell me everything. But first take a few deep breaths. Blippy, tea for two!\u201d</p>\n<p>After they sat down in the sitting room and Harry finished a strong cup of Earl grey he was able to tell Ginny the whole story. </p>\n<p>\u201cPfft.\u201d Ginny said with an unimpressed snort. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t even know the cause of death this soon after he died. We\u2019ll demand an autopsy first thing. That should get your man off in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said, finally feeling like things would be all right again. He hadn\u2019t dared attack his father that morning, not with four other Aurors around. Harry knew James would arrest his own son in a heartbeat and with Harry behind bars as well there would be no one to arrange for legal help and to ensure a fair trial was held. Tom had understood this much as well, and he\u2019d gone quietly with James while giving Harry a reassuring smile. After that Harry had gotten dressed in a hurry and apparated to Ottery St Catchpole at once. </p>\n<p>Ginny and Harry used her floo to get to the Ministry and Ginny marched them straight to the office of Susan Bones, Head of the Auror Department. Susan was of course the niece of Amelia Bones, who had been Head of Magical Law Enforcement for many years until she eventually ran for Minister for Magic which she remained to this day. Susan\u2019s father, and Amelia\u2019s brother, Edgar Bones was the current Head of Magical Law Enforcement. Good old nepotism at its finest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe enjoy playing a game of Quidditch on the weekends,\u201d Ginny explained when Harry wondered out loud how Ginny even knew Susan Bones personally. Harry knew her from Hogwarts because they\u2019d been in the same year, but they never spent any time together. \u201cSusan is a ferocious beater. She played for Hufflepuff during her Hogwarts years,\u201d Ginny added with an admiring smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cGinny, what can I do for you?\u201d Susan was seated behind her desk and gave Ginny a curious look. </p>\n<p>\u201cSave James Potter from ruining his own career, for one,\u201d Ginny said, and then she gestured at Harry. \u201cThis is my good friend Harry Potter, the zoologist. His boyfriend was just arrested by James on some bogus charges because James doesn\u2019t like his son dating a Slytherin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Susan sighed, long and deep, and then she waved her wand and summoned her Patronus. \u201cGet me James Potter. Now,\u201d she said to the silvery wolf, who disappeared through a wall immediately. </p>\n<p>For the next five minutes Ginny and Susan made small talk about their Quidditch plans for the weekend while Harry tried not to succumb to the nerves he felt swirling through his entire body. Harry kept telling himself that everything would be all right and Tom would be at his side again in no time. But a small little voice in the back of Harry\u2019s mind was already planning on how to get Tom out of Azkaban. Perhaps he could train Rene to put sleeping potions in the human guards\u2019 beverages and then sneak in himself to break Tom out. And if that didn\u2019t work and Harry truly became desperate, he could always go and get Aisa the basilisk and just storm Azkaban like the reckless Gryffindor he was. </p>\n<p>The prospect of never seeing Tom again had that big of an effect on Harry, that he was seriously considering the life of a wanted criminal just to have Tom by his side again. Harry had never met someone like Tom before, someone who fit him and his strange life so perfectly. Heck, they even spoke the same, very rare language. If that wasn\u2019t true love, Harry didn\u2019t know what was. </p>\n<p>James Potter barged into the office without knocking and looked down at Susan Bones over his nose as though she was a mere secretary and not his immediate boss. One might wonder why James Potter wasn\u2019t the Head Auror, or even Head of Magical Law Enforcement. He was certainly old enough, with enough years in the field to qualify for it. </p>\n<p>But the fact that James Potter\u2019s best friend had turned out to be the worst crime boss their world had seen in decades, while James hadn\u2019t noticed a thing wrong with him, had pretty much killed James\u2019 career. Ever since then James had been passed over for every single promotion, as had Sirius Black. They were doomed to work the rest of their lives as Aurors in the field because neither had noticed that their best friend Peter Pettigrew was running a huge crime syndicate right under their noses. </p>\n<p>Harry suspected that this was the most important reason James Potter was so adamant that Harry become an Auror. It was, at least to James, the one opportunity they had to save the Potter name, at least in the Ministry. Hyacinth had become a Healer, just like Lily was, so James couldn\u2019t complain about that. Harry, though, had chosen what to James seemed like an entirely useless profession and thus Harry should drop it and do as his father told him. But Harry wasn\u2019t about to give up his own life and happiness because his father had shitty taste in friends, and hence their battle of wills had begun and seemed to be coming to a head, finally, in Susan Bones\u2019 office. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have an autopsy report for Albus Dumbledore yet?\u201d Susan asked, giving James a stern glare. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet. Should be coming at end of the morning,\u201d James muttered while giving Harry a disgusted glare. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen why on earth have you arrested a man for Dumbledore\u2019s murder?\u201d Susan demanded. \u201cFrom all initial assessments I\u2019ve seen it appears he died of massive heart failure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Dumbledore told us Tom Riddle was a criminal right before his own death. If that\u2019s not suspicious, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d James said in a sort of belligerent tone that suggested everyone in the room was batshit crazy aside from himself. </p>\n<p>Ginny snorted and crossed her arms. \u201cYou mean a senile old man accused my client of a crime someone else was convicted of 70 years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, Susan shook her head and gave James a tired look. \u201cDid Dumbledore present you with any actual evidence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis word should be enough!\u201d James said with finality. </p>\n<p>Susan looked like she very much wanted to roll her eyes but her professionality stopped her at the last moment. \u201cAuror Potter, release Mr Riddle from custody at once and drop the charges.\u201d When James looked ready to explode in protest, Susan actually stood up from her chair, placing her hands on her desk as she leaned closer to James. \u201cI don\u2019t care what sort of vendetta you have against your own son and his boyfriend, but you will keep it out of my department and the Wizengamot, is that understood? If evidence shows up that Mr Riddle is guilty of a crime, I will arrest him myself, but until such a time he remains a free man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was deeply impressed by Susan\u2019s little speech, because it even got James to back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d James muttered, slowly stepping up to the door. \u201cBut just for the record, you\u2019re making a huge mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuly noted,\u201d Susan snapped, glaring at the man with fire in her brown eyes. \u201cNow get the hell out of my office.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry got an impulse he couldn\u2019t control and he quickly followed James into the hallway. \u201cDad, this is it,\u201d Harry said, finally saying the words he\u2019d wanted to say for years and years but hadn\u2019t dared. These were his parents, after all, and Harry loved them, even if he hadn\u2019t actually liked them for years now. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone too far this time. I no longer want any contact with you or mum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, that is codswallop. You\u2019re our son, even if you haven\u2019t acted like it in years,\u201d James started on his usual monologue of how Harry was the family disappointment, but Harry was done. He was well and truly done. </p>\n<p>With an empty heart, that had once housed endlessly conflicting emotions, Harry stepped away from his father. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said and then quickly entered Susan\u2019s office again, shutting the door behind him with a huge sense of finality. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ginny asked with a knowing glint in her eyes. Harry could only nod in response, throat too tight for any verbal response. \u201cMum was saying just the other day she hasn\u2019t seen you in too long. Come over Sunday for dinner at the Burrow and bring your new man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d Harry whispered, beyond grateful for the many amazing people he had around himself. Even if he\u2019d just lost his parents, Harry knew he still had plenty of family to fall back on in his life. </p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later Harry and Ginny approached the Atrium where they found Tom patiently waiting. Harry gave him a long, tight hug. </p>\n<p>Ginny cleared her throat after a few minutes. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Ginny Weasley. Harry\u2019s friend and your solicitor. If you ever need anything, just contact me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly a pleasure to meet you,\u201d Tom said, finally prying himself away from an overly clingy Harry. \u201cAnd thank you for your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ginny waved his gratitude away. \u201cI barely did anything. I have to be in the office, though, so I\u2019ll see you both Sunday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on Sunday?\u201d Tom asked after Ginny disappeared in the throng of people around them. </p>\n<p>\u201cDinner with Ginny\u2019s parents, Arthur and Molly. They\u2019re lovely people,\u201d Harry said, looking up at Tom in slight disbelief they were really together again. The relief he felt was enormous and made him question his earlier thoughts of what he would do if Tom had been locked up. Harry leaned closer so he could whisper in Tom\u2019s ear. \u201cI was about ready to get Aisa and storm Azkaban if you\u2019d been convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a splendidly Gryffindor plan,\u201d Tom said with a terribly fond smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have done it, too,\u201d Harry insisted, though he couldn\u2019t hold back a wide grin. \u201cWhat I\u2019m actually trying to say is that I\u2019ve\u2026 you know\u2026 gotten used to you and I\u2019d like to keep you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>That</i> is your big romantic declaration?\u201d Tom rolled his eyes, though his cheeks flushed a slight pink in obvious pleasure. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you try it, then,\u201d Harry said, winding his fingers through Tom\u2019s and all but dragging him to the fireplace. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow about I show you instead,\u201d Tom whispered against the side of Harry\u2019s head. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou did make me a promise last night, that\u2019s true,\u201d Harry said, warm arousal coiling in his belly. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep you to that promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>When they arrived home, Tom took Harry to bed, even if it was the afternoon. They then proceeded to show each other exactly how much they\u2019d grown to like the other. Multiple times. </p>\n<p>Life went on and Harry kept his distance from his parents, though not for lack of trying on their part. But Harry had informed everyone of what had happened and what he\u2019d decided to do about it, and even Severus understood that Harry meant it this time and no longer let Lily through Harry\u2019s wards whenever she begged him to. </p>\n<p>Dumbledore\u2019s autopsy came back as heart failure, as everyone had expected, so Tom didn\u2019t hear from the Auror department again, much to Harry\u2019s relief. </p>\n<p>Five weeks after Tom\u2019s morning in a jail cell they woke up to a grunting sound. The first thing Harry saw was two large dark eyes giving him a demanding look. </p>\n<p>Rene stood beside the bed, visible this time, with an empty pineapple can in his hand. He shook it at Harry, grunting again. He\u2019d started showing himself more and more since a few weeks and nowadays he was almost always visible whenever he got hungry. </p>\n<p>\u201cRene needs breakfast,\u201d Harry mumbled into his pillow while outside Paul announced that there was rain coming with a few wails. </p>\n<p>Beside him, Tom turned over and gave Harry a bleary look. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own critters to look after.\u201d In a box beside Tom\u2019s side of the bed several tiny kittens stirred and let out pitiful squeaks. A neighbour across the street had found a litter of kneazles no more than three weeks old under his shed that appeared abandoned and he\u2019d dropped them off at Harry\u2019s. Since Harry had been in a meeting with his publisher that day, Tom had accepted them. In the brief period Tom had looked after them by himself he\u2019d already grown rather attached to them. </p>\n<p>Harry worried they might end up with five kneazles of their own, though thankfully Hermione, Ginny, Hyacinth and even Blaise had already expressed an interest to adopt one of them once they were old enough. So Tom and Harry would probably end up with one kneazle for themselves, which was fine by Harry. </p>\n<p>Harry got up, pulling on his bathrobe as he walked into the living room. There, on a wall, hung the lethifold, displayed under heavy preservation charms. Harry had studied the creature extensively, even going so far as performing an autopsy with the assistance of Severus and Tom. Harry was currently writing a new book about the lethifold and their extraordinary capture of it. And when Harry\u2019s publisher heard about Tom\u2019s unique predicament, he\u2019d offered him a book deal as well, which Tom had accepted. Tom had just started writing his own book about his life as a basilisk and kept coming up with silly titles, such as \u2018The Day I Ate A Tiger\u2019 and \u2018A Basilisk Named Tom\u2019, much to Harry\u2019s amusement. </p>\n<p>Just as Harry shuffled into the kitchen and grabbed a can of pineapple for Rene from the warded cupboard, a Patronus flew into their kitchen. It was Rupert Longbottom\u2019s hedgehog. \u201cHyacinth went into labour last night and the baby is almost here. Meet us in St Mungo\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTom!\u201d Harry yelled, instantly awake. \u201cTom, Hyacinth is having her baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou go ahead!\u201d Tom yelled back from the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll feed the kittens and then meet you there!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry threw on whatever clothes he could find while Rene sat on the couch, munching pineapple and watching Harry tripping over himself. Then Harry rushed out the door and apparated straight to the hospital. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs Tom looking after the kittens?\u201d Hermione asked him first thing as he met his friends in the hallway outside Hyacinth\u2019s room. \u201cAre they all right?\u201d Hermione hadn\u2019t adopted another cat after she lost her beloved Crookshanks, and now that she had a baby kneazle coming her way soon she appeared more of an expectant mother than Hyacinth even.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re fine. He\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d Harry assured her while he waved hello to everyone else already there. </p>\n<p>Once Harry\u2019s parents arrived, his friends closed ranks around Harry and didn\u2019t let them near him, for which Harry was eternally grateful. Tom arrived next and studiously ignored the suspicious glares James kept sending his ways while he chatted with Regulus and Barty.<br>\nHyacinth accepted that Harry had gone no contact with their parents and was more than willing to accommodate Harry\u2019s desires as long as Harry accepted that Hyacinth still wanted to keep a relationship with James and Lily. Harry was fine with that, since he had no desire to try to dictate his sister\u2019s life. She was old enough to make her own choices. </p>\n<p>Rupert yanked open the door and stuck his head out. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d he yelled, face flushed while a baby\u2019s wail could be heard in the background. </p>\n<p>The two couples of brand new grandparents were allowed in first, but after that it was Tom and Harry\u2019s turn, together with Neville and his wife Hannah.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve named him Francis Harrison Longbottom,\u201d a proud Rupert said while Harry carefully held his nephew. He looked a bit like a grindylow, if Harry was to be honest, but that was probably just the result of the recent birth. Harry hoped. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call him Frankie,\u201d Hyacinth said with a tired smile while she kept a careful eye on Harry holding her child. </p>\n<p>\u201cA fine name,\u201d Tom said as he stood beside Harry and peered at the babe with mild interest. </p>\n<p>Later, when they came home and sat down on the couch together, Tom turned to Harry and gave him a questioning look. \u201cDo you want kids?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell no, I\u2019ll stick with animals,\u201d Harry said. Tom seemed utterly relieved by that reply but before he could say anything they were ambushed by five kneazle kittens with very sharp claws. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh look who\u2019ve managed to escape their box,\u201d Tom said with a beaming smile while one of the kittens climbed on top of his head. </p>\n<p>Rene came sauntering into the living room, shaking his empty can in their direction while outside Paul started wailing.</p>\n<p>Harry shared a smile with Tom while a kitten crawled inside his shirt and he realized that right at that moment, life was absolutely perfect.</p>\n<p>The end.</p>"
