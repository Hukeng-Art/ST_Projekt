  "text": "<p>Most restaurants refuse to deliver to this part of City Z. At the delivery company you work for, you\u2019re the only one that\u2019s willing to come to this area. Sure, your company charges a bit more for you to come here, but that\u2019s not what you like about the job.</p>\n<p>More than the money, you like how quiet and desolate it is here. The only other humans you see on the streets are right near the barrier that separates this area from the rest of the city. Bold teenagers, the occasional stupid drunk that\u2019s there on a dare, influencers trying to get an edgy picture to post. They always give you weird looks when you ride by on your bike.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t see any of them today, which makes you slow down just a bit. Digging in your pocket, you pull out your phone to check for monster sightings. Not that a monster sighting would <em>stop</em> you from continuing into the ghost town! No, you\u2019ve pedaled past them on the sidewalk before and even had to break out the stun gun a couple of times. You\u2019re not a chicken; you won\u2019t let a monster get between you and your paycheck.</p>\n<p>Seriously, you need the money. If you\u2019re ever going to get your own place. You\u2019ve been living with your friend and her boyfriend for a while, but that\u2019s\u2026<em>awkward</em>. Feeling like a third wheel, even when you\u2019re just trying to enjoy your time off at home. Getting your own apartment would feel a lot better.</p>\n<p>There haven\u2019t been any monster sightings in the area. You raise an eyebrow and look forward, down the road. It\u2019s pretty quiet right now. Not <em>eerily</em> quiet, though. So you start pedaling forward again.</p>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t take too long to finish your delivery and it\u2019s the last one for the day. Really, all you have to do is put it down in front of their door, snap a picture on your phone for proof, and then you can head home. It\u2019s never that quick and easy with these two, though.</p>\n<p>All around you, the only sound you can pick up is the wind and the shifting of dirt on the pavement. There are no birds, no stray cats or dogs, not even rats. Honestly, it\u2019s pretty surreal. The place looks like it should be full of people, but it\u2019s so empty.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as empty as you think it is. You think you\u2019re alone, riding your bike down the street, but you\u2019re not. Someone is watching you from the shadows. Staying out of sight, but keeping his eyes focused on you.</p>\n<p>Speed o\u2019 Sound Sonic has seen you in the area before. You come here at least twice a week, sometimes more. Always alone, on your bike, with food. Always staying for a few hours before you leave again with a smile on your face. It all points to only one conclusion: you\u2019re friends with Saitama.</p>\n<p>Why else would you visit so often? And why else would you look so happy? So either you\u2019re his friend or you\u2019re dating him. Either way, you\u2019re close with the bald hero and Sonic can use that to his advantage.</p>\n<p>A grin begins to draw at the corners of his lips and he lifts a hand to cover it. He can\u2019t help it, though. So excited to have found Saitama\u2019s weakness, so eager to move forward with his plan. It\u2019s a little devious and he knows it, but if his plan works then he\u2019ll finally be able to beat him.</p>\n<p>Sonic moves from one spot to the next, always keeping you in his line of sight. He\u2019s been watching for a while, but he still isn\u2019t sure who you are exactly. You have to be a hero or something, right? Probably one of the lower classes and lower ranks, since he\u2019s never seen you on the news.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re not very flashy, for a hero. Always showing up in what looks like your street clothes. You don\u2019t seem to have any gimmicks or special weapons. Just that stun gun that he\u2019s seen you use on a monster once. Dodging monsters on your bike seems to be your specialty.</p>\n<p>The fact that you prefer to dodge the monsters instead of taking them down like most heroes would proves that you\u2019re there for Saitama. Not to train. Not to defeat monsters, like some of the overly confident heroes that come wandering into the ghost town thinking they\u2019ll be able to clear it out alone.</p>\n<p>Sonic watches you pedal down the street, but he has your route memorized by now. He knows that you like to slow down when you get close to the shopping district because you like to look at all of the stores that have closed. He knows that you like to take pictures of the desolate streets and abandoned restaurants. It\u2019s actually a kind of cute, how you take pleasure in weird things like that.</p>\n<p>You have no idea that you\u2019re being watched, that you\u2019ve been watched for over a month. Completely oblivious, you\u2019re just thinking about what you\u2019ll have for dinner tonight. Wondering if your roommates will want to get takeout or if they\u2019ve gone off on a date night. It\u2019d be kind of nice to have the kitchen to yourself for once.</p>\n<p>The apartment building comes into view and you dismount to walk with your bike the rest of the way. There\u2019s no reason to lock it since there\u2019s no one else around so you just leave it propped against the building like always and begin climbing the stairs to get to their floor. Level after level, passing floors of vacant apartments. The only sounds are your footsteps on the stairs and the wind.</p>\n<p>When you knock on their door and hear the call of \u201cjust a minute\u201d, you\u2019re more than happy to wait. If it wasn\u2019t your last delivery of the day, you might be a little less patient. Every time you bring them food, it\u2019s never quick. You usually end up spending at least an hour hanging out with them and sometimes that takes a toll on your paycheck.</p>\n<p>The door opens and you expect to see Saitama, since he\u2019s the one that called to you. Instead, you find Genos. You can tell by the apron he\u2019s wearing that you\u2019ve interrupted something so you bow and apologize for the intrusion. Between the two of them, you\u2019re way more concerned about pissing off Genos.</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei has been waiting for you.\u201d The blond cyborg opens the door wider to let you in and takes the bag of takeout from your hand. \u201cEverything is here this time? The last time we ordered, the restaurant forgot-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cExtra condiments.\u201d You pull a few packets out of your pocket and hold them up for him to see. A half-smile curves your lips as his metal fingers take them from you. \u201cI told them about it last time, but they said they couldn\u2019t do a refund since there\u2019s no extra charge for these.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe menu says that the order comes with two packets.\u201d Genos is trying to argue with you as you walk further into the apartment, trailing behind you and checking the boxes in the bag to make sure everything is there.</p>\n<p>Does he want to be refunded for like fifty yen worth of condiments? Honestly\u2026you bought these \u201cextra packets\u201d yourself because you know Genos won\u2019t let this go. You thought that maybe if he thought these came from the restaurant, maybe he\u2019d drop the subject. You should\u2019ve known better.</p>\n<p>You step into the main room and find Saitama in front of his tv, plugging a second controller into the game system that\u2019s set up. \u201cHey,\u201d you greet him, smiling when he looks at you over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Hey. You got here just in time. Sit down.\u201d He shuffles back to sit on the floor next to you, pushing the controller into your hands and taking up the other one. \u201cKing left this here for me to practice and I need someone that won\u2019t let me win every time.\u201d</p>\n<p>A glance toward Genos shows him looking over at you both before carrying the bag of takeout into the kitchen. No hint of guilt on his artificial face. You know him well enough to know he doesn\u2019t feel sorry about it. Everything he does, he does for the sake of Saitama; even if it\u2019s something he just <em>thinks</em> is in the older hero\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you played this one before?\u201d Saitama drags your attention back to the game. His deadpan stare is directed at the screen, fingers already poised near the buttons and joystick on the controller.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d It looks like\u2026another fighting game. Except that this one has characters that are all very cutesy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see any monsters on your way in?\u201d He pauses to scratch at his stomach through his shirt. Saitama doesn\u2019t sound worried, doesn\u2019t frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot today. It\u2019s pretty quiet out there right now.\u201d The game starts and you launch into it immediately, but you keep talking. \u201cI can\u2019t stay for long today. I want to try to get out of the ghost town before sunset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t that just an hour away? Come on. Genos can take you home if you stay later.\u201d In his reflection on the screen, Saitama\u2019s eyes briefly flick in your direction.</p>\n<p>Gritting your teeth, you manage to land a combo and KO his character. \u201cI don\u2019t want to impose. I mean, I know Genos-san has stuff to do.\u201d You wait for his character to get up for the next round and continue. \u201cI should be fine, I guess. I have my stun gun.\u201d</p>\n<p>A stun gun can only really help you if the monster is a lower level threat. Like a wolf level threat. Even then, monsters sometimes travel in groups. If you got attacked by a group of them, you\u2019d pretty much be screwed. The stun gun really isn\u2019t the best weapon against monsters, but it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re not a hero; you\u2019re a delivery girl. The fact that you go into the ghost town is already going above and beyond, but fighting off monsters? That\u2019s high above your paygrade. Sure, you could ask a hero for help. Plenty of Class C heroes would probably escort you if you ask, but you don\u2019t want to bother them.</p>\n<p>How ridiculous would that be? Calling for a hero every time you have to make a delivery. You shake your head, thinking about it as you leave the apartment. It\u2019s already much darker than it was when you went inside.</p>\n<p>On the horizon, the sun is dipping low and casting a warm orange glow across the sky. The shadows are growing and it makes you uneasy. You hurry down the stairs and to your bike, listening for movement and only hearing the wind. This seems like a good time for monsters to start emerging so you need to be quick.</p>\n<p>Climbing onto your bike, you begin pedaling off down the road. Not casting a glance back at the building, not bothering to look around. Your legs pump harder, carrying your bike faster and trying to focus on just getting out of the ghost zone. The sooner you\u2019re out, the safer you\u2019ll feel.</p>\n<p>Sonic has been waiting for you to leave Saitama\u2019s place. His eyes narrow on your figure as you stand up and pedal faster, like you\u2019re trying to outrun something. Oh\u2026did you finally notice him?</p>\n<p>Covering his mouth, he tries to hide the grin that\u2019s taking form. You\u2019re more perceptive than he thought, aren\u2019t you? How could he underestimate you like that? There are no monsters behind you so you can only be trying to run from <em>him</em>!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s cute, laughable, for you to think you can escape. Who do you think you\u2019re up against? Sonic leaves his perch on a roof near Saitama\u2019s and begins moving among the shadows. Approaching you rapidly and waiting for you to look over your shoulder at him, his heart pounding with anticipation.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t look back. No, you just keep moving and staring straight ahead. He doesn\u2019t understand why you haven\u2019t glanced over your shoulder, but it doesn\u2019t matter. If you won\u2019t face him and fight him with honor, Sonic will just have to take you without any fight at all.</p>\n<p>The wind is rushing past your face and you\u2019ve built up a pretty decent amount of speed. You follow your usual route, the quickest route, back toward the edge of the ghost town. Just as you\u2019re thinking that it won\u2019t be much farther, you feel an impact against your bike and everything happens so quickly.</p>\n<p>In the blink of an eye, your body is flying over the handlebars and you skid over the pavement. The air is forced from your lungs and you\u2019re covered in scrapes. Your hoodie and jeans are ripped in some spots. Blood runs down the side of your face and dots your palms as you struggle to push yourself back up.</p>\n<p>Looking back at your bike, your eyes widen at the sight of what looks like a <em>shuriken</em> buried in your now flat back tire. You lift your gaze, trying to find the source of the attack, but you don\u2019t see anyone. Then you feel fingers tangling in your hair and yanking your head back.</p>\n<p>Large grey eyes are staring down at you with disappointment. The man holding your hair sighs and he crouches down to your level. \u201cI expected more from someone like you. You made this way too easy for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>This\u2026isn\u2019t a monster. No, this is just a guy. A guy with black hair that\u2019s tied back in a topknot with a few stray strands hanging over his eyes. There are strange purple markings underneath his eyes, like makeup or tattoos, and he\u2019s wearing a black tracksuit as if he\u2019s been working out in the ghost town.</p>\n<p>You can feel blood dripping off your jaw onto the cement. What is this guy doing in the ghost town? This is a guy\u2026right? He does kind of have feminine hips. You try to push that thought to the side because it\u2019s ridiculous and there\u2019s warmth blooming in your cheeks.</p>\n<p>Are you <em>blushing</em>? Sonic leans closer, a grin tugging at his lips. He\u2019s trying so hard not to let his bad habit show, but it almost feels like you\u2019re <em>teasing</em> him. Is this your twisted way of <em>flirting</em>? Pretending to be weak so he\u2019ll make the first move and now, at any second, you\u2019ll show him how strong you really are?</p>\n<p>He\u2019s thinking about what to do next. If he lets go of you, you\u2019ll either attack him or try to run again. Either one could be interesting. You\u2019re close with Saitama so you\u2019re bound to be strong like his student. Maybe that\u2019s why you don\u2019t usually fight monsters; you just don\u2019t see them as worth your time.</p>\n<p>Sonic should\u2019ve known better than to let his guard down. While he was contemplating his next move, he didn\u2019t notice you making a move of your own. He didn\u2019t see your hand slip into your pocket for the stun gun so when you shove it against him, it takes him by surprise. A strong jolt of electricity races through him and makes him tense for a few seconds before he manages to shove you aside.</p>\n<p>You try to push yourself to stand, but before you can even get onto your elbows, the sole of his sneaker presses down on your wrist. He grins down at you, lightly grinding his shoe against your wrist and making you wince at the pain. Your fingers finally fall open, releasing the stun gun and letting it fall onto the cement to the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy wallet\u2026it\u2019s in my back pocket,\u201d you tell him, hopeful that he\u2019ll take it and leave. To your dismay, he doesn\u2019t do that. One blink and he\u2019s straddling your waist, leaning forward with his face above yours and his fingers tangled in your hair again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. I need to take you before Saitama shows up. But don\u2019t worry, Y/N. We can pick up where we left off later.\u201d It\u2019s the last thing he says before he lifts your head and smacks it harshly against the cement, knocking you out.</p>\n<p>You should just give Genos fifty yen from your wallet. That\u2019s the first thought that comes to mind when you start to wake up. It might be the hit to the head or the impact from flying over the handlebars of your bike, but for some reason it feels really important that you give Genos fifty yen.</p>\n<p>Opening your eyes, you stare down at your lap with that stupid thought bouncing around in your head. You know Genos doesn\u2019t forgive dumb little slights like forgetting sauce packets. One time when you borrowed their bathroom, you forgot to put the seat up again when you were done and he never let you forget about it. Just give him the fifty yen and tell him the restaurant sent it as a refund.</p>\n<p>\u201cNgh.\u201d You wince as you wake up a little more, becoming aware of the throbbing pain at the back of your head. When you try to put a hand to the area, you realize your hands are tied behind your back. Eyes widening, you slowly lift your head and remember what happened before you blacked out.</p>\n<p>The bike accident, the shuriken buried in the back tire, that guy that grabbed you. It\u2019s now that you notice the warmth against the side of your arm and shoulder, a slight pressure. You hear the rustle of paper and your pulse quickens as you look at him from the corner of your eye.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting beside you on the floor, close enough that your shoulders are touching. The menus from the saddlebag on your bike are spread out in front of him and he\u2019s looking through one right now. Large grey eyes skimming the list of dishes, lips set in a straight line like he\u2019s giving it a lot of consideration. The black tracksuit from earlier has been replaced by a pair of tight black pants and a shirt that\u2019s hanging off one shoulder to reveal the strap of his tank top underneath it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2026am I?\u201d It\u2019s asked with hesitation. You don\u2019t know his intentions.</p>\n<p>Honestly, you kind of thought he might be a member of the yakuza when you saw him in that tracksuit earlier. Before he knocked you out, you thought he might just be after your wallet; it\u2019s not uncommon for delivery people to get attacked because people think they\u2019re carrying a bunch of cash. The fact that he knocked you out and brought you to a second location tells you he wasn\u2019t after your wallet.</p>\n<p>His head turns and he raises an eyebrow when he sees that you\u2019re awake. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would wake up so soon,\u201d he comments, shifting his gaze back to the menu in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re at my base.\u201d</p>\n<p>A look around makes you kind of\u2026question this. It looks kind of meager for the base of some kind of criminal. The only indication that he might be someone dangerous are the weapons sitting against the far wall, but you\u2019re pretty confident that this guy is working alone. You\u2019re still not sure what his intentions are, though.</p>\n<p>Feeling around behind you, you don\u2019t feel your phone or wallet in your back pocket. You know your stun gun isn\u2019t on you anymore. He probably took it for himself or left it on the street. Same with your bike, which really sucks because that thing wasn\u2019t cheap!</p>\n<p>Subtly tugging at the rope around your wrists, you try to keep him distracted. \u201cWho are you and why did you bring me here?\u201d Honestly, you\u2019re not expecting him to explain himself. Why would a kidnapper tell their captive-?</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Speed o\u2019 Sound Sonic. And I\u2019m holding you hostage so Saitama will fight me.\u201d He offers the information so easily that it leaves you a bit taken back. The man beside you is smirking as he finally turns to face you, his shoulder drawing away from yours. \u201cIt took a while for me to discover his weakness, but now that I know it, I have an advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSaitama-san\u2019s\u2026weakness?\u201d You can\u2019t help tilting your head as your wrists go still behind your back. For some reason, you can\u2019t keep your eyes on him. The sight of his smirk makes you feel flustered and warmth rises to your face when he leans closer, a hand resting on the top of your head.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> his weakness,\u201d he replies with confidence. Sonic can feel his pulse racing now that he has you here with him. The excitement of the fight to come, the eagerness to see the look on Saitama\u2019s face when he sees that Sonic is holding his cute, little friend hostage.</p>\n<p>Bringing his face closer to yours, his heart does something weird. It\u2019s like a brief acceleration, making his pulse skip. Maybe it\u2019s the way you\u2019re blushing or maybe it\u2019s just that he hasn\u2019t seen your face up close like this before. His hand leaves the top of your head and grips your jaw, holding you still so he can study you.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something undeniably cute about you. A little fire in your eyes, an endearing sort of pout when you try to look away and find his fingers gripping tighter. Sonic can feel this weird tingle where his fingers touch you and it\u2019s spreading through him. Oh\u2026that\u2019s not good.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s bad because he <em>likes</em> the way it makes him feel. So much so that he can feel his grin spreading. Unprofessionally wide, wild, and he can\u2019t seem to get rid of it. Even when he sees your eyes widen, it doesn\u2019t do anything to affect his grin.</p>\n<p>Staring back at him, still kind of confused about him calling you Saitama\u2019s weakness, your eyes are focused on his grin. It\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before and somewhere at the back of your mind, you know you should be freaked out. It\u2019s just that\u2026it\u2019s kind of cute. Maybe it\u2019s because he looks so excited.</p>\n<p>\u201cH-how am I his weakness?\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense to you. Sure, you hang out with Saitama sometimes, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re super close.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to resist the urge to save you,\u201d he answers, his delight leaking into his voice. \u201cI left a challenge on his door and told him where to meet me tomorrow. He won\u2019t be able to ignore my challenge because I have <em>you</em>. He won\u2019t risk his friend\u2019s safety by brushing me aside. And if I have you there at the fight, I can keep using you to my advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before you can try to argue or even explain that his plan might not work, you feel his warm fingertips stroke along your jaw. It sends a pleasant shiver down your spine and your eyes half-close. Your teeth sink into the inside of your cheek to keep yourself quiet as you drag your gaze away from those large, grey eyes.</p>\n<p>The back of your head is still throbbing from getting smacked against the street earlier, making tears swell at the corners of your eyes. You finally have to close them, clenching your jaw and vaguely wondering if you might have a concussion. His fingers leave your skin and you hear a rattling sound before something cold is pressed against your cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere. Take these.\u201d Sonic meets your gaze when your eyes open, giving you an expectant look. In one hand, he\u2019s holding a bottle of painkillers and in the other, he\u2019s holding a bottle of water to the side of your face.</p>\n<p>You stare back at him for a moment, wondering if he remembers that your wrists are bound behind your back. Giving a tug at your restraints, you look over your shoulder at the tight binding and then turn your eyes to Sonic again. \u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He leans forward again with an air of intimidation\u2026until he remembers. Without offering an apology, he just opens the bottle and lifts two painkillers to your lips, pushing against the plush flesh. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so soft. There\u2019s warmth rising to his face as he slips the pills and his fingertips past your lips and into your mouth. He manages to contain his excitement to a half-grin as his fingers brush against your tongue and bottom lip. Soon they\u2019re pulled away and he opens the water bottle.</p>\n<p>Your face feels hot as you sip the cold water and swallow the painkillers. He\u2019s still sitting really close to you and now you\u2019re even more flustered than before. \u201c\u2026thanks\u2026\u201d you mumble, turning your head to the side.</p>\n<p>Sonic doesn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he stands and carries the bottles into the small kitchen area. Something feels \u201coff\u201d. Why aren\u2019t you scared? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s planning to actually hurt you, but you don\u2019t have any way of knowing that.</p>\n<p>For all you know, he could be planning to slit your throat the second you fall asleep again. He might be planning to torture you and cut off little bits and pieces to send Saitama if he doesn\u2019t show up for the fight. So how and why are you staying so calm?</p>\n<p>He grimaces and hears the quiet creak of the rope around your wrists. You\u2019re trying to escape, you <em>want</em> to escape, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve just given up hope. Maybe you think you\u2019re strong enough to take him on by yourself. You did manage to get a jab in with that stun gun earlier.</p>\n<p>The ninja is standing with his back to you, his head lowered and loose, dark hair falling around his face. A wide grin splits his face and he covers his mouth as he glances back at you again. Take him on? Someone like you? You\u2019re probably a Class B hero, at best, right? And you think you can stop a professional killer like-?</p>\n<p>\u201cSonic-san. I need to use the bathroom,\u201d you interrupt.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Turning to face you again, he sees you squirming a bit and knows he should probably allow it.</p>\n<p>As soon as you\u2019re in the bathroom with the door closed, you finally let the panic wash over you. Subconsciously keeping it at bay since you woke up, you can now feel your heart hammering in your chest. What the hell have you gotten yourself into? This man kidnapped you to use as bait for Saitama, but you\u2019ve got a gut feeling that it\u2019s not going to work.</p>\n<p>Didn\u2019t Sonic say that Saitama won\u2019t be able to ignore him this time? Or something along those lines. That makes it seem like Saitama has been actively avoiding fighting him! And you know the bald hero well enough by now to know he won\u2019t do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do! What if he doesn\u2019t show up for the fight?!</p>\n<p>Calm down, calm down. You pace a little in this tiny room, staring down at your hands. Sonic untied you and then bound your wrists in front of you so you can take care of yourself in the bathroom. There are some faint red marks around your wrists and you know you\u2019re probably going to have bruises once you\u2019re released.</p>\n<p>So! No phone, no stun gun, limited use of your hands. How are you going to get away? Your eyes dart around the bathroom, but there\u2019s nothing in here to help you escape. Just some soaps and shampoo, toothbrush, stray hairbands, and\u2026the mirror above the sink.</p>\n<p>You pause and look at your reflection, perplexed. Didn\u2019t you scrape your face on the road earlier? You had blood running down your face when he attacked you. Now, you can see that some bandages have been plastered over your injuries and it looks like he cleaned away all of the dried blood. If you\u2019re just a hostage and he wants Saitama to feel like you need protected, why did he bother cleaning you up?</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me waiting,\u201d he warns from the other side of the door. The wood creaks as he leans against it and you can imagine the smirk on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry! Just a second.\u201d Why did you apologize? You shake your head as you run the sink water. There\u2019s no way you can try to escape while he\u2019s awake. He was so much faster than you when he attacked you earlier. Your best chance is to wait until he falls asleep and then try to slip out of here.</p>\n<p>Sonic isn\u2019t stupid. He knows what you\u2019re thinking when you sit across from him on the floor to eat dinner. You\u2019re going to wait for him to fall asleep and then try to escape. He wouldn\u2019t expect less from someone like you. It\u2019s too bad that he\u2019s so well trained; he just won\u2019t fall asleep before you do.</p>\n<p>Instead of the evening ending with a fight or with you triumphantly fleeing his base, you fall asleep around the same time he does. You, leaning against Sonic\u2019s side with your back against the wall. Sonic, beside you with his arm wrapped around you shoulders in a half-hearted attempt at keeping you upright. The night ends with you both slumping over onto the floor with you cuddling up against him.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Saitama steps out of his apartment and has to pause when he sees the weird note that\u2019s stuck to the door. Reading it makes him raise an eyebrow and call out to Genos, who\u2019s in the middle of cleaning the kitchen. \u201cHey. Who\u2019s Y/N?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sonic\u2019s plan had overlooked one crucial detail. Saitama doesn\u2019t know your real name. Since the day you met, he\u2019s called you \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d or \u201cdelivery girl\u201d. He never uses your real name, despite the fact that you wear a name badge. Truthfully, he only knows you by the nicknames he\u2019s given you.</p>\n<p>So, sadly, this ransom note from Sonic saying that he has \u201cY/N\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean anything to Saitama. He shrugs it off and shoves the note into his pocket before he sets off again. It only dawns on him that \u201cY/N\u201d might be you when he finds your bike sitting abandoned in the street with a shuriken buried in the back tire.</p>\n<p>As your sweet dream of lounging in your own apartment begins to recede, reality smacks you in the face. You can feel the cold, hard floor against your side, but opening your eyes shows that you\u2019re not alone. Sonic\u2019s face is just a short distance away from yours and you can hear his heart beating beneath your ear, feel the rise and fall of his chest.</p>\n<p>Heat rushes to your face as your fingers curl, gripping at his shirt from where your bound hands are pressed against his side. Every muscle tenses as you look up at his face. His eyes are closed, lips just barely parted, and it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s genuinely asleep.</p>\n<p>Speed o\u2019 Sound Sonic. That\u2019s what he said his name was, right? He\u2019s obviously not a hero since he kidnapped you, but that\u2019s a really unusual name. The way he was acting yesterday, it kind of seems like he sees Saitama as a rival. So what exactly is he?</p>\n<p>Cute. The thought makes you quickly look away and your hands curl into fists, the rope biting deeper into your wrists. Closing your eyes, you try to push that thought away and calm your racing pulse.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s asleep right now! This could be your only chance to escape! The problem is that you don\u2019t know where he put your cellphone and stun gun. You don\u2019t even know where his \u201cbase\u201d is so you might be really far away from your apartment.</p>\n<p>Very, very carefully, you try to draw away from him. Lifting your head off his chest and shuffling backwards a little. Your stomach clenches with anxiety as you stare at his face, watching for any sign that he\u2019s waking up. His eyelids stay closed, but his mouth begins to twitch slightly so you freeze.</p>\n<p>Seconds tick by as you watch and wait. Staying absolutely still until he finally seems to sink back into a deep sleep. Just a bit more and you can turn onto your back. Then you\u2019ll be able to push yourself up and\u2026</p>\n<p>You almost yelp when you feel Sonic\u2019s arm wrap around your waist and drag you back to him. Your teeth close on your bottom lip to muffle it to a quiet squeak. Your heart is beating out of control as you find your face pressed into his chest. Both of his arms slide around you, his body pressing against yours, but he\u2019s still silent.</p>\n<p>Is he awake? You manage to draw your face back a little and lift your gaze. From what you can see, he\u2019s still asleep. Completely unaware of how he\u2019s cuddling against you on the floor. Totally oblivious to the very unfortunate position of your bound wrists being trapped between your body and his, your hands against his crotch.</p>\n<p>When is he going to wake up? What\u2019s going to happen when he wakes up? You close your eyes tightly and try to keep your breathing steady, but it\u2019s hard to stay calm in a situation like this.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re not sure how much time passes. Lying there with his arms wrapped around you, trying to stay still, feeling him move in his sleep to get more comfortable. It feels like your face is burning when his hips press forward, rubbing himself against your hands and burying his face in your hair.</p>\n<p>When he finally stirs awake, you\u2019re surprised that he simply releases you. Sonic pushes himself to sit up, stray locks of dark hair falling over his eyes, and grimaces when he checks the time on his phone. You struggle to push yourself up as well while he makes his way to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time before my fight. You\u2019ll need to eat fast.\u201d He rummages in the fridge for something and pulls out a convenience store rice ball, still in its packaging. \u201cEat this while I get ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>You manage to catch it when he tosses it your way, but you\u2019re still really confused. He\u2019s acting like nothing happened. Maybe he doesn\u2019t care? Why does that\u2026make you feel a little disappointed? Why should it matter if this weirdo that you just met yesterday cares about cuddling with you?</p>\n<p>Maybe\u2026it\u2019s because you liked it. As uneasy as you were at first, when you think about it now, it\u2019s like your stomach is filling with butterflies. A warmth spreads across your face and pools in the pit of your stomach as you watch him disappear into another room.</p>\n<p>What you don\u2019t see is the blood rushing to his face the second he\u2019s out of your line of sight. Sonic\u2019s heart is pounding and he covers his mouth, hiding the broad grin that spreads across his face. You\u2019re so cute, <em>too</em> cute, and he doesn\u2019t know what to do with you.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s rare for him to get flustered, but you\u2019ve somehow managed to do it. You\u2019ve managed to make a professional like him practically melt just because you cuddled up to him while he was asleep. You knew what you were doing, didn\u2019t you? You think you can win? Just watch; he won\u2019t lose a challenge like this!</p>\n<p>Time isn\u2019t on his side right now, though. No, he\u2019s supposed to meet Saitama for their fight in less than an hour and it\u2019s going to take some time to travel to the meeting point, even with his speed. So if he\u2019s going to outdo you, it\u2019ll have to wait.</p>\n<p>He changes clothes quickly and as he\u2019s pulling his hair back, he pauses and looks at an oversized hoodie that\u2019s on the floor. It\u2019s his hoodie, bought purely for comfort, and it has \u201cNin-Nin\u201d printed across the chest. Sonic\u2019s smile grows as he finishes securing his hair into a topknot and he grabs the hoodie.</p>\n<p>Yours is torn, isn\u2019t it? That weird, faded green hoodie with \u201cHappy Delivery Company\u201d printed on the back. You\u2019ll appreciate a little gift from him, won\u2019t you? And won\u2019t you look good wearing something of his? How will Saitama react when he sees you wearing his hoodie?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Saitama is a no-show. After your cute captor insisted on you wearing his hoodie, after traveling by train and then being carried on Sonic\u2019s back to the huge, open space\u2026the hero never shows up. You sit on the ground with your back against a tree trunk, watching Sonic pace and trying to hide your blush.</p>\n<p>What is he wearing? Is that a bodysuit? Is it latex? It\u2019s clinging to his body like a second skin, leaving very little to the imagination. There\u2019s so much heat radiating off your face right now and you feel this sort of clenching in your core.</p>\n<p>Squirming a bit, tugging at the rope around your wrists and trying to loosen it, you keep your eyes on him. He\u2019s slender despite how strong he is. His muscles are toned, but not bulky. You can see him glance your way and you lower your head, stilling your hands.</p>\n<p>In a blink, he\u2019s crouched in front of you and bringing his face near yours. His grey eyes are narrowed as he lifts a hand, cupping your chin to raise your face. \u201cWhat are you thinking about right now?\u201d There\u2019s something in his tone that tells you he\u2019s testing you. The problem is that you don\u2019t know what answer he\u2019s looking for.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen\u2026if Saitama-san doesn\u2019t show up?\u201d You ask with hesitation and you can see a flicker of something in his gaze when you say your friend\u2019s name. The thumping of your heart gets even faster as his other hand falls to your lap, hooking a finger into the rope around your wrists.</p>\n<p>His lips draw into a smirk as he effortlessly forces your arms up and pins them above your head against the tree. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want you then I\u2019ll just have to keep you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like there\u2019s a lump in your throat, stopping you from objecting. All you can do is stare back at him as your face burns with a blush. The hand beneath your chin drifts to your jaw like yesterday and you can feel the warmth of his fingertips even through the layer of cloth over his hands. Your heart is beating so wildly now, adrenaline rushing through your body as he strokes your cheek.</p>\n<p>Sonic\u2019s face is so close to yours as his lips draw into a grin. Unbridled excitement in his eyes as he leans down more and squeezes your wrists in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d have a problem if I kept you,\u201d he taunts.</p>\n<p>Your eyes widen a bit as he straddles your thighs. Gulping as you struggle to keep your thoughts coherent, but they\u2019re jumbled in your panic. You close your eyes when he strokes your bottom lip.</p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re a hero, you\u2019re still no match for him. It gives him a certain thrill to feel your thighs tensing under him, to feel you shaking a little. Looking down at the warm tint to your face, he can\u2019t contain his excitement. Sonic shifts his hips a little, pressing down against your soft body and loving the little squeak you make when he rubs against you. This is fine, for now.</p>\n<p>Saitama didn\u2019t show up for the challenge, but he has this consolation prize and it\u2019s almost as good as beating the hero. Of course, he\u2019d planned to let you go after the fight. Now he has more time alone with you. After all, he can\u2019t let his bait go until he gets what he wants from Saitama.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026I need to go to my job,\u201d you try to argue.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what you <em>want</em>.\u201d Sonic\u2019s thighs squeeze against the outside of yours and his fingers skim down the side of your neck. \u201cYou\u2019re not even trying to get away. Why don\u2019t you try to push me off of you?\u201d His pulse quickens as he challenges you, half-hoping that you\u2019ll give in and fight him while also hoping you\u2019ll let him get even closer.</p>\n<p>What should you do? If you try to fight him and fail, what will happen? Your thoughts are so cloudy, so flustered, that you can\u2019t decide what to do. When you feel his fingers draw away from your neck, you open your eyes and see his wrist flick. The kunai between his fingers catches the sunlight and glints, making your blood run cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fighting me because you don\u2019t <em>want</em> me to let you go,\u201d he teases, bringing it close to your cheek.</p>\n<p>The cold metal\u2019s edge brushes over your sensitive skin, sending little jolts of adrenaline through you and making you tense up. Why is it? There\u2019s this tingle in your core at the feeling of the blade. You bite your lower lip and look away from him because your face feels so hot that you\u2019re sure he can feel the warmth against his own face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you <em>like</em> being my captive, Y/N?\u201d Again, that taunting tone that makes you shiver in a strangely pleasant way. Sonic grins down at you and draws his hand back, pulling the kunai away from your skin. It\u2019s lifted and stabs into the rope that binds your wrists, barely missing your hands. Leaning down to your ear, his mouth skims over the curve of it. \u201cYou can get out of that now, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a sharp tug, you\u2019re able to pull your hands free. The cut rope falls to the ground and you don\u2019t know what to do next. Fight him? But he\u2019s so much faster than you. You don\u2019t have your stun gun and\u2026you don\u2019t really want to fight him. Not just because you\u2019d get your ass kicked, but because you just don\u2019t want that kind of conflict.</p>\n<p>Instead of shoving him or trying to land a punch, you let your arms fall to your sides. You try to steady your breathing, but it\u2019s difficult when you can still feel his lips near your ear. His fingers are slipping beneath your chin again to hold you in place. Pressing at your flesh when he feels you try to move.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you scared? Or do you just know that I\u2019m stronger than you? You were so cocky yesterday when you had your stun gun and now you\u2019re paralyzed with fear. I\u2019m disappointed. I wanted to have the chance to put you in your place.\u201d Sonic\u2019s tone is just bordering on being condescending.</p>\n<p>He leans back on your lap and tilts your head back. His thumb brushes along your bottom lip and his grin is unrestrained; wide and nearly terrifying. \u201cYou look good beneath me.\u201d The ninja\u2019s hips grind down against you and that\u2019s when he gets a better response from you.</p>\n<p>Your hands raise to grip his shoulders and you bite back a whimper. With his hips angled like that, he\u2019s grinding his bulge right between your thighs. Pleasure blooms in your core and you dig your fingertips into his shoulders through his bodysuit. \u201cSonic-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that too much for you?\u201d He tilts his head, still taunting you. His hips go still and he leans down, his lips nearly touching yours. \u201cOr can you handle more than that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Before you can try to form an answer, your stomach growls and shatters the tension between you. Sonic\u2019s eyes widen a bit and then he laughs. You wish you could crawl into a hole and disappear. How could that happen at the worst possible moment?!</p>\n<p>He stands and grips your wrist, pulling you with him. \u201cFine. We can continue this later, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d The man retrieves his kunai and tucks it away so casually. As if he didn\u2019t almost stab you through the wrists with that thing just a few seconds ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Um\u2026n-no, I didn\u2019t say I did!\u201d You rub at your wrists, but you can see bruises forming on your skin and there are a few abrasions where the skin has been torn.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say that you didn\u2019t,\u201d he counters. Sonic begins walking back in the direction of the city, taking a leisurely pace and keeping his eyes on the horizon. Watching in case Saitama is just late. Hoping that the bald hero will appear at any moment so he can have his moment. When he hears you jogging to catch up to him, he smirks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026where are we going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your stomach just growl? We\u2019ll get lunch and then go back to the base. There\u2019s nothing else to do since he didn\u2019t show up. Unless you want to have a match with me.\u201d He can see you beside him, shaking your head, and his smirk falters. Really, he wanted to fight <em>someone</em> today.</p>\n<p>As he walks, he imagines defeating Saitama with you there to witness it. How impressed would you be? You\u2019re probably a Class B hero or maybe a low Class A; he knows you\u2019re holding back on him, after all. So how will you feel when you see him beat a powerful hero like Saitama into the ground?</p>\n<p>Until that time comes, though, Sonic might as well have some fun with you. This little lunch date will give him another opportunity to get some payback for how flustered you made him this morning. Honestly he didn\u2019t expect to like you so much when he first started observing you, but the more time he spends with you, the more he likes you. You\u2019re just too cute for him to release.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll leave another challenge on Saitama\u2019s door later, but even if the hero shows up next time, Sonic isn\u2019t sure he wants to let you go. To be honest, you seem to feel the same way. You\u2019re toying with him, flustering him. Maybe you\u2019re becoming just as attached, maybe you don\u2019t want Saitama to \u201csave\u201d you.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Saitama\u2026is at home. Not because he doesn\u2019t want to save you. No, it\u2019s because he\u2019s pretty sure that Sonic meant midnight instead of noon. Seriously, what kind of person would schedule a fight during lunch time?</p>\n<p>He\u2019s disappointed. You can tell by the way he keeps sighing and glancing out the window. All of the excitement from earlier is gone from his eyes and you can see him scowl when he checks the time. He really wanted to fight Saitama, didn\u2019t he? But why?</p>\n<p>Honestly, you feel kind of bad for him\u2026kind of <em>guilty</em>. Even though there\u2019s nothing you could\u2019ve done to make sure Saitama showed up. The more you think about it, the less surprised you are that he didn\u2019t make an appearance. Seriously, you\u2019re not sure that he even knows what your name is.</p>\n<p>You always get called \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d when you visit him and Genos. Despite the fact that you introduced yourself the first time you delivered food to their place. Despite the fact that your \u201cHappy Delivery Company\u201d hoodie has your name on the left side of the chest. Even Genos calls you \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d so you know that the chances of either of them responding to Sonic\u2019s ransom note are slim.</p>\n<p>Should you tell him? What if he gets embarrassed? You pick at your food and glance across the table at him. He\u2019s staring out the diner window, his chin in his hand and a few dark strands of hair hanging over his face. You\u2019re starting to feel like you took away a kid\u2019s puppy or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your title?\u201d Sonic asks this so abruptly, turning to look at you.</p>\n<p>Heat rushes to your face as your eyes meet and you quickly avert your gaze. \u201cHuh? Um\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026delivery girl.\u201d You\u2019re not sure why he\u2019s asking about your job title. Maybe he caught on and realized that Saitama doesn\u2019t know your name. Or maybe he\u2019s going to call your boss at the delivery company.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery Girl.\u201d His mouth curves into a smirk and Sonic leans closer. You\u2019re blushing so you must realize what a stupid hero name that is. That association you work for really does suck at picking out names, don\u2019t they?</p>\n<p>He was dwelling on the fact that Saitama was a no-show for the fight, but now his attention is on you. Of course, he hasn\u2019t missed the way you\u2019re fidgeting with your fork. Your stomach was growling so loudly earlier, but now you\u2019re too nervous to eat. It\u2019s actually pretty cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you mumble, glancing across at him. You\u2019re gripping your fork tighter, pushing at your food.</p>\n<p>Sonic crosses his arms and leans back in the booth, a smug smile settling on his face. \u201cYou really don\u2019t care about escaping, do you? How long has it been since I untied you? And you haven\u2019t even tried to run away. You <em>like</em> being my hostage, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>More blood rushes to your face and the fork drops from your fingers, clattering against the plate. \u201cHuh? No, I just\u2026it isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what is it? Why haven\u2019t you tried to run? Don\u2019t tell me that you think Saitama is going to suddenly show up and save you. He didn\u2019t even show up for our fight today.\u201d There\u2019s a taunting lilt to his voice and his large grey eyes narrow. Challenging you, waiting, half-hoping that you\u2019ll make a move and show him your strength.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just stalling. I\u2019ve seen you take on monsters before so I know you\u2019re not as weak as you\u2019re trying to act.\u201d Sonic tilts his head, an eyebrow raising. The smile on his lips begins to spread and there\u2019s a spark of excitement in his stare. \u201cIf you really want to escape then you\u2019ll have to actually <em>try</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen you take on monsters? Wait\u2026so he\u2019s seen you use your stun gun to protect yourself? But the first time you saw him was yesterday. Has he\u2026been\u2026? Your pulse accelerates as realization sinks in, your stomach twists in knots as you force yourself to maintain eye contact with him. \u201cSonic-san, have you\u2026have you been <em>watching</em> me?\u201d</p>\n<p>A warm tint rises to his cheeks and he scowls, shifting his eyes back to the window. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve been watching you. I spent a lot of time planning this so I needed to observe you and learn your routine. Why are you surprised?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sonic isn\u2019t going to let you fluster him. Not again, not so soon after what happened this morning. If anyone is going to be flustered, it\u2019s going to be <em>you</em>. He\u2019s in control of this hostage situation. Though, it doesn\u2019t really feel like you\u2019re his hostage at this point.</p>\n<p>To everyone else in the diner, the two of you look like you\u2019re on a date. Maybe a first date, judging by how much you both have been blushing and avoiding eye contact. One of the waitresses is commenting to another near the kitchen, saying it must be a blind date or something.</p>\n<p>That just makes it more awkward. You both hear her and now you\u2019re sinking lower in your seat and Sonic is smirking as a terrible idea comes to mind. With your head bowed, eyes focused on the food on your plate, you don\u2019t notice him getting up to join you on your side of the booth. His thigh presses against yours, an arm sliding around your shoulders, as he grins wickedly.</p>\n<p>He leans down to your ear and his warm breath tickles your sensitive skin. \u201cIf you\u2019re too nervous to eat, I can always feed you,\u201d he teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-no, that\u2019s okay!\u201d Tensing up, you lift your fork in a trembling hand and start eating again. You\u2019ve already got butterflies in your stomach from how close he is, but when he leans down to steal a bite of food off your fork, your breathing hitches. He\u2019s so nonchalant about the indirect kiss, but there\u2019s so much blood rushing to your face that you\u2019re afraid you might get a nosebleed.</p>\n<p>Part of you wonders if you should try to fight him, try to run away. What would you do, though? Just try to get back to your apartment, to your roommate and her boyfriend? Go back to being the third wheel?</p>\n<p>Honestly, this whole \u201chostage situation\u201d hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as you would\u2019ve expected. He didn\u2019t even make you pay for lunch when you went to that diner and he patched up your wounds from the bike accident. This really doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in danger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0When you get back to his \u201cbase\u201d, you try to keep your distance. Sitting on the floor and wondering what you should do. Trying to escape might be stupid, for a number of reasons. However\u2026you also know that you can\u2019t stay here forever.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got a job to return to. You\u2019ve got a goal; you\u2019re saving up to move out on your own! If you don\u2019t try to move forward, you\u2019ll never get to where you want to be. So, really, you <em>have</em> to escape so you can get back to your life.</p>\n<p>Sonic is in the bathroom. You can hear the sound of running water and there\u2019s a bit of steam coming from beneath the door. Seizing this opportunity, you push yourself to stand and begin searching. You saw him lock the door to his \u201cbase\u201d with a special key that he keeps with him so you can\u2019t just open the door and run. The odds of him just leaving it unattended in the bathroom are slim, too; he probably hid it somewhere.</p>\n<p>If you can find your phone and stun gun, you\u2019ll feel a lot better. You can call for help or try to surprise him with the stun gun. If you stun him, you might be able to find the key to get out. He\u2019s fast, though. You\u2019ll have to be careful or he\u2019ll knock you out again.</p>\n<p>There really aren\u2019t a lot of places where he could\u2019ve hidden your weapon and your phone. None of the cabinets in the kitchen area have them. You don\u2019t see them anywhere in the main room. The futon doesn\u2019t have them hidden in the blanket or beneath the pillow.</p>\n<p>Your eyes shift to the bathroom door and you can feel your heart sinking. That\u2019s the only place he could have hidden them, right? Unless they\u2019re not in the apartment. There\u2019s a cabinet under the sink and that\u2019s the only place you haven\u2019t checked yet.</p>\n<p>If you wait for him to come out and then ask to use the bathroom, he might get suspicious. Sonic is intelligent, contemplative, so he\u2019ll know that you\u2019re planning something. However\u2026if you go in there now\u2026</p>\n<p>Heat rises to your cheeks because you know he\u2019s in the shower. You can still hear the water running, hear the splash of droplets on the tiles. Warmth settles in the pit of your stomach and you try to swallow, but your throat feels tight. It should be fine, right? To slip in while he\u2019s distracted and try to find your stuff?</p>\n<p>You move toward the door as quietly as possible, hoping that the running water will cover up any sounds you make. The door opens without any noise and you peer inside. It\u2019s steamy, but you\u2019re still able to make out his figure beyond the glass shower door. He\u2019s only partially obscured by the steam and you\u2019re able to see enough to make you stumble.</p>\n<p>Just barely able to steady yourself in time, you clutch the doorframe for support. Your breathing is a bit shaky and you cover your mouth with one hand, unsure of whether you should watch him or look away. How are you supposed to focus on finding anything with something so distracting in the room?!</p>\n<p>Forcing your gaze away from the shower, you try to slink over to the cabinet. As silently as possible, listening for any sign of him opening the shower door or turning off the water. Everything seems to be going smoothly. You crouch down, reaching for the cabinet door, when you feel a warm hand clamp onto the back of your neck.</p>\n<p>Faster than you process it, you\u2019re being dragged away from the cabinet and find your back slamming against the now closed bathroom door. An arm braces against the wood at your side and his free hand grips your neck firmly. Sonic\u2019s grey eyes are half-closed as he stares at you, his tongue sliding along his lower lip before his mouth draws into a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t resist it for long. I just didn\u2019t think you would really take the bait so quickly. Now what should I do with you?\u201d Strands of his long black hair damply stick to his shoulders, neck, and chest. They hang over his face and makes his grin look even more sinister.</p>\n<p>\u201cBait?\u201d It\u2019s the only word you can get out. Too startled, too nervous, to form a full sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d let my guard down? You came in here to look for your stun gun, didn\u2019t you, Y/N? What were you going to do? Were you going to try to stun me while I was in the shower?\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like your brain is on fire. Your knees are about to buckle, but you can\u2019t let yourself fall to the floor because he\u2019s so close. Poor thing. Your heart beating so fast, like a cornered rabbit\u2019s. It only gets worse when you make the mistake of lowering your eyes from his.</p>\n<p>His hair is still dripping, water droplets clinging to his skin and running down his frame. The steam from the still running shower doesn\u2019t do anything to hide him now. You can see how defined his muscles are, see all of the scars that litter his flesh, but your eyes dart back to his before you can look lower than his hips. His fingers are shifting up from your throat to grip your jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d Sonic doesn\u2019t look bothered by the fact that he\u2019s naked. He seems confident as he keeps your back pinned against the door, slotting a knee between your thighs. \u201cWhat should I do with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>How are you supposed to answer that? Your hands are shaking at your sides and you curl them into fists as you struggle to form a response. Your clothes are getting slightly damp as he presses closer, his skin still wet from the shower. The speed of your pulse increases and warmth blooms in your core when his knee rubs against you.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know,\u201d you finally mutter. There\u2019s no way you could blush any more than this. No way your heart can beat any faster without popping.</p>\n<p>He seems calm and confident to you, but you don\u2019t know how fast his own heart is beating. You don\u2019t seem to notice the pink tint to his cheeks or how\u2026<em>excited</em>\u2026he is. The feeling of your body pressed so close to his makes his blood rush to a particular part of his anatomy and he\u2019s surprised you haven\u2019t noticed.</p>\n<p>This is a win for him. At least, <em>he\u2019s</em> counting it as a win. Just look at how flustered you are. You\u2019re too anxious to even speak. Blushing and stumbling over the few words you do manage to force out, your thighs subconsciously squeezing his knee between them. Despite your nervousness, you aren\u2019t pushing him away.</p>\n<p>Sonic\u2019s grin doesn\u2019t waver as he leans closer. His face lowers to the side of your neck and he snickers. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m asking the wrong question. What do you <em>want</em> me to do with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you think you\u2019d find your stun gun in here?\u201d There\u2019s a taunting lilt to Sonic\u2019s voice, his lips brushing against the sensitive skin of your neck. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you thought I\u2019d lower my guard. You didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to stun me in the shower, did you? That\u2019s pretty cocky of you. But I guess I shouldn\u2019t expect anything less.\u201d</p>\n<p>Your pulse skips when you feel the dampness of his skin pressing tighter against you, wetting your clothes and making you feel the heat of his body. Any words that come to mind become caught in your throat as a clash of excitement and fear takes place in your head. Unsure of what he might do next, what might happen to you.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering me? Are you embarrassed? It was a really simple plan, but you couldn\u2019t even execute it. You\u2019ll have to be faster than me if you want to have any chance of taking me by surprise.\u201d Drawing his face back, he pushes his knee tighter between your legs and grins at your flustered expression. \u201cIf you want to beat me, you\u2019ll have to face me head-on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are they? My stun gun and my phone?\u201d The words finally come and you\u2019re rewarded by his wet fingertips gripping the neck of your hoodie. It makes you tense up, makes you subconsciously hold your breath in anticipation.</p>\n<p>Sonic\u2019s eyes half-close as he feels your thighs tense on either side of his knee. With his grin spreading wider, he tugs at the neckline and steps backwards. His knee is pulled away from your thighs and he drags you over to the sink, pressing you against the edge so you\u2019re forced to look into the mirror. Standing behind you, he keeps his body pressed close against your back.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you think it would be that easy? That you\u2019d find them, take me out, and run away? You\u2019re my hostage until Saitama agrees to fight me.\u201d His heart beats even faster when he can feel your hips move a little, inadvertently rubbing against him. He was already\u2026<em>excited</em>\u2026but now it feels like his blood has ignited in his veins. The adrenaline, the desire. Today wasn\u2019t a total loss after all, was it?</p>\n<p>His left hand slips beneath the edge of the hoodie and his fingers hook into the waist of your pants. \u201cYou were going to attack me and try to escape. So why should I go easy on punishing you? If you did find your stun gun and used it on me in the shower, you could\u2019ve done some real damage. So how should I make sure that you don\u2019t try it again?\u201d</p>\n<p>You can see him in the mirror and the grin on his lips is so devious that you can feel heat pooling in your lower half. It\u2019s difficult to keep your eyes on his so you lower them and it just makes things worse. Unable to see him, you\u2019re now focused on how tightly he\u2019s pressed against your back. How a certain part of his anatomy is stiffly pushing against your butt, how his hips move just a little to grind on you.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d you argue, turning your head slightly. The fear is fading as you feel his warm fingertips against your skin, slipping beneath the edge of your pants and trailing downward at a torturously slow pace. Your hips buck in response and a fresh wave of heat takes over your face when he laughs.</p>\n<p>Without warning, he draws away from you and slips his hand out of your pants. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Sonic waits for you to turn around before closing in on you again, planting a hand on the sink edge to either side of you so you\u2019re caged in. \u201cSince I can\u2019t trust you, I\u2019ll just have to keep you even closer than before. So take off your clothes. You\u2019re going to join me in the shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>Outrunning him and slipping out of the bathroom would be impossible; you\u2019ve seen how fast he is. At the same time, you\u2019re obviously self-conscious. You\u2019ve known Sonic for around a day, even though he\u2019s been watching you for much longer than that. Anxiety makes you chew at the inside of your cheek as you glance from him to the shower behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I promise not to look for my stun gun\u2026if I promise to just stand here, then can I-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I decided that I can\u2019t trust you. Now, take off your clothes unless you don\u2019t mind them getting wet.\u201d His arms fold across his chest as he steps back to give you some room. Unashamed of being naked right in front of you, not even slightly embarrassed that he\u2019s hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Right, but I don\u2019t have a change of clothes. So I don\u2019t have anything clean to wear when I get out.\u201d It\u2019s your last hope for changing his mind. The only other thing you can think of as a valid excuse for not stripping in front your abductor.</p>\n<p>An eyebrow raises and he tilts his head slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s insane. That\u2019s all you can think to yourself as you reluctantly begin to shed your clothes. The oversized hoodie he gave you, the slightly ripped jeans you\u2019ve been wearing since you were thrown off your bike, the t-shirt you were wearing when he snatched you up. When you\u2019re down to your bra and underwear, there\u2019s so much heat in your face that you think you might get a bloody nose.</p>\n<p>What are you going to do? A glance over shows him still impatiently standing next to the shower door, a hand on his hip. Watching you intently, a teasing grin tugging at the corners of his lips. It stirs up the butterflies in your stomach and you close your eyes, hastily taking off the rest of your clothes.</p>\n<p>Sonic has been watching you for quite a while, but he\u2019s never seen you like this. He\u2019s shadowed you back to the border of the ghost town, watching you strip off your hoodie to tie it around your waist. He\u2019s followed you to your apartment and seen you slip into the bathroom for a bath. As long as he\u2019s been watching, he\u2019s never been treated to something so satisfying.</p>\n<p>The steam can\u2019t hide you from him, once you\u2019re both in the shower. Letting his large, grey eyes roam up and down your figure to appreciate every scar and freckle. Admiring the shape of your body and the complexion of your skin. He commits all of it to memory as the warm water runs down your form.</p>\n<p>\u00a0While he\u2019s looking you over, you have your eyes lowered as you try to figure out what to do. Should you put your back to him? You\u2019ve got your arms crossed over your chest and one leg in front of the other to try to maintain a little privacy, but it\u2019s getting difficult. If you have your back to him, he won\u2019t be able to see your more intimate areas, but then you won\u2019t be able to see what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take off your bandage,\u201d he points out, his lips suddenly beside your ear. Sonic smirks as you jolt backwards, startled by his abrupt closeness. Leaning closer, he reaches out to peel the bandage off your temple.</p>\n<p>Immediately, you can feel the scrape stinging and you try to back up more. Your back meets the shower wall and your hearts leaps into your throat when he moves directly beneath the showerhead to stand in front of you. There\u2019s no hiding yourself from him now; he can see pretty much everything. Despite your nervousness, you feel excited beneath the heat of his gaze.</p>\n<p>Water runs down his chest, drips off his dark hair, as you find yourself looking at him again. So many scars decorating his skin. Muscle toned and built from years of training. The water trails lower and your eyes follow the droplets before you can stop them. There\u2019s a tightening in your core at the sight of him stiff like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks clean,\u201d he mutters, examining the scrape on your temple. A thumb gently glides over the skin beneath your injury and there\u2019s a softness to his expression for a moment, almost as if he\u2019s relieved. Almost as if he\u2019d worried about the wounds you received from his attack.</p>\n<p>Your eyes lift, but don\u2019t meet his. No, you\u2019re looking at the scars on his chest and shoulders. There are just so many of them\u2026and some of them look pretty deep. Before you can think about what you\u2019re doing, your hand lifts and your fingers lightly trace one of the deeper scars on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sonic doesn\u2019t sound angry, but puzzled. Faintly amused, even. \u201cIf you want to touch me, then don\u2019t hold back.\u201d His fingers wrap around your wrist and he presses your hand flat against his skin. Letting you feel the rapid beating of his heart and leaning in close.</p>\n<p>When his lips press against yours, it\u2019s with a roughness and impatience. As if he\u2019s been waiting for you to initiate this. An arm wraps around your waist, his hand pressing at your lower back to pin the front of your body against his. Slipping himself between your thighs and groaning into the kiss when he feels your bare skin against the most intimate part of his body.</p>\n<p>Your fingers stay pressed tightly to his chest and your eyes slip closed, mouth moving against his to reciprocate the kiss. One day. You\u2019ve known him for only one day and at the back of your mind, you\u2019re aware of that. There\u2019s just\u2026something about him. This effortless, unintentional cuteness that you can\u2019t help but admire.</p>\n<p>Part of you wonders if it\u2019s destiny. You wanted to change your life, didn\u2019t you? Meeting Sonic, even though he claimed to have taken you as a hostage, might be fate. Maybe it was the catalyst you needed to force things to change.</p>\n<p>His free hand slips beneath your thigh to lift your leg, wrapping it around his waist so he can rub against you and nudge himself between your lower lips. When he finally breaks the kiss, you bury your face in the side of his neck. Panting and wrapping your arms around him to steady yourself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want this, don\u2019t you?\u201d he taunts, pressing the warm tip against your slit. He shallowly lets it push past your slick folds and moves his hips, teasing you. \u201cThis is why you didn\u2019t run away when I untied you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2026just do it.\u201d Your back arches as the head of his member nudges against your sensitive bud at the top of your slit. Whimpering and biting the inside of your cheek.</p>\n<p>Pressing forward, the ninja eases his tip into your slit. His fingertips dig into your hip, his face settled into the curve of your neck as he pushes in more and more. The warm tightness eagerly accepting his length and rubbing along his shaft when he draws back before thrusting forward sharply. The way your lower lips press at the base of his member is so soft and warm that he has to bite back a groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you feel that? You\u2019re made for me,\u201d he murmurs, drawing back to thrust in again. Sonic doesn\u2019t rush; he wants to savor this feeling. Lifting his face to look at you and smirking when he finds you biting your lip, your eyes closed. He takes full advantage of this and kisses you again, his hips moving and bringing the sound of skin slapping against skin.</p>\n<p>You can feel him rubbing at every sensitive area along your walls. Stimulating you and making your slick arousal coat his member. Every thrust makes your back rub on the shower wall, your leg tightening around his waist. Your nails dig into his back as the tension building in your lower half. The stinging pain urges him on.</p>\n<p>More and more. Every thrust easing you closer to the edge of release, your chest rubbing against his and adding to the stimulation. You cling to him, panting and digging your nails in deeper. When you can feel yourself nearing a climax, your fingernails drag down his back and you let his name slip past your lips in a pleading moan. Your opening contracts around his member in a steady rhythm as it squeezes his length.</p>\n<p>The sensation of you squeezing him like this drives him to move faster. Hammering his hips into yours, causing friction over your clit as his pelvis presses forward as tight as possible. He lifts your other leg so you\u2019re reliant on him to hold you up and he pounds into you as he chases his release. Pushing in as deep as he can, but still keeping the strokes fast.</p>\n<p>The muscles in his lower abdomen tense as he gets close. Sonic\u2019s arms wrap tight around you and he angles his hips, trying to urge one more climax out of you so you can do it together. He\u2019s rewarded with a low moan as he hits a particularly sensitive spot. The devious grin returns to his lips and he nuzzles his face into the side of your neck.</p>\n<p>When you both reach your release, you feel him slip out and he groans. His climax strikes the tiled floor of the shower, running toward the drain. You\u2019re clinging to him, bucking your hips forward when he kisses your sensitive flesh. So wrapped up in the pleasure coursing through your veins that, for a while, you were able to forget your situation. Then he spoke again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m not going to let you go, even if Saitama comes for you. You\u2019re mine now.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a lazy Sunday. Not that he minds it. Of course, he\u2019d prefer it if a super strong opponent suddenly showed up in the ghost town or somewhere in City Z, but he won\u2019t complain about being able to just lounge around his apartment and read manga.</p>\n<p>The television is on, the news broadcasting a special report about a hero charity event that\u2019s supposed to take place in a few weeks. In the bathroom, there\u2019s the sound of scrubbing and running water while Genos cleans the toilet. A gentle breeze make the wind chime jingle and it\u2019s then that his stomach decides to growl loudly.</p>\n<p>Rolling onto his back to sit up, Saitama lowers his eyes to his stomach. \u201cHey, Genos. When are we having lunch? It\u2019s getting kind of late.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scrubbing stops and Genos soon appears in the doorway. \u201cWhat would you like for lunch, sensei? I still have some ingredients to make curry-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I don\u2019t want curry. I want something summery. We haven\u2019t had delivery in a while. Let\u2019s order some cold somen.\u201d He sees Genos tilt his head slightly and it brings just the faintest frown to his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Did you want to eat something else? We can order chilled udon instead, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei, the reason why we have been unable to order delivery is that Delivery-chan was abducted approximately nine days ago. You received a letter of challenge from Speed o\u2019 Sonic and he said that he would hold her hostage until you agreed to fight him. You never fought him so she was never released. Delivery-chan is the only delivery person that will deliver to the ghost town so we have been unable to order meals to be delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Saitama simply stares at him for a moment, scratching at his stomach beneath his t-shirt. \u201cHow many times did you just say \u201cdeliver\u201d?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive.\u201d Genos seems almost proud of the fact.</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, the hero stands and clenches his fist. \u201cRight. I need to rescue Delivery-chan if we\u2019re ever going to eat delivery again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSensei, it has been approximately nine days since her abduction. Statistically speaking, it is likely that she is no longer alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Nah, I don\u2019t think Sonic would kill her.\u201d As he goes about changing into his hero suit, he nods to himself. \u201cHe\u2019s probably happy to have someone to show off for. I almost feel bad about having to take her away from him, but if I don\u2019t, then we\u2019ll never be able to get delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sonic has stopped caring about whether Saitama will try to save you. It doesn\u2019t matter if he comes or not; Sonic doesn\u2019t have any intention of letting you go, even if the hero makes an appearance. While he can\u2019t imagine releasing you, he\u2019s also perplexed by the fact that you don\u2019t seem to mind.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been nine days since he snatched you up, but after the first two days, you haven\u2019t tried to escape. You haven\u2019t even asked about your cellphone and stun gun for the past few days. You\u2019ve stopped questioning what will happen to you. It seems like you actually <em>want</em> to be there.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t make sense to him. Sitting on the floor brushing his freshly washed hair, his large grey eyes lift to watch you. You\u2019re making some tea, standing with your back to him and leaving yourself completely open. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be a hero? What kind of hero would give in so quickly?</p>\n<p>He does like it when you cooperate, of course. You sleep next to him every night without complaining, shower with him without arguing. Sonic almost wonders if this whole thing has been a honey pot situation. What if your precious Hero Association used you as bait and now they\u2019re using you to collect information on him?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out today. You have five minutes to get ready.\u201d Sonic rises from his seat and stretches a bit, rolling his shoulders. He can see you looking at him over your shoulder, feel your gaze briefly wander to his exposed chest and scars. Seeing the warmth rising to your cheeks makes him smirk. You still get so flustered when you see him, no matter how many times you\u2019ve seen him like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d You\u2019re hesitant to ask, but your curiosity gets the best of you. He\u2019s taken you back to that spot from before, where he\u2019d told Saitama to meet him for a fight. You\u2019ve spent hours there with him, waiting to see if Saitama would show up and being disappointed for him when the hero never showed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d The sinister smile drawing across his lips does not inspire confidence, but you can\u2019t deny that you like seeing him excited like this.</p>\n<p>Nine days. It\u2019s been nine days since you met him. Nine days of eating together, sleeping together, spending every minute together. After you both crossed that line in the shower\u2026you\u2019ve been questioning your sanity a bit.</p>\n<p>How long does it take for Stockholm syndrome to take form? You knew him for such a short amount of time before you crossed that line and since then, you haven\u2019t tried to escape. Of course, part of it is the fact that Sonic seems to have forgotten that you\u2019re supposed to be a hostage.</p>\n<p>He certainly doesn\u2019t treat you like a hostage. When you went out together the next day, he even grabbed some new clothes for you so you\u2019d have something to wear. He\u2019s cooked for you, he\u2019s dozed off next to you without showing any trace of unease so it\u2019s likely he trusts you. You\u2019re not just questioning your own sanity, but his as well.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t know what his plans are for you today. If he\u2019s planning to go back to that same spot to wait for Saitama or if he has something else in mind. When you leave his \u201cbase\u201d together, he doesn\u2019t tie your wrists or keep a tight grip on your arm. He simply walks beside you with his hands in his pockets, his large gray eyes narrowed and his teeth chewing lightly at his lower lip as if he\u2019s deep in thought.</p>\n<p>When you feel your pulse flutter a bit, you quickly look away from him. Sonic has this bad habit, worse than that smile of his, where he sometimes looks so irresistibly cute without even trying. Maybe that\u2019s another reason why you haven\u2019t really minded spending these past nine days with him. Or maybe it\u2019s because he always keeps you guessing; keeping your interest piqued.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d Sonic\u2019s voice pierces your thoughts and when you look over, he\u2019s holding out his hand expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Oh, uh, okay?\u201d You hesitantly put your hand in his and he turns it palm up. From his pocket, he draws out a familiar object and settles it into your palm, curling your fingers around it. \u201cWait! This is-!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour phone. Go ahead. Call whoever you want. I charged it so the battery is full.\u201d He meets your curious gaze with a look of faint suspicion. Testing you, waiting for you to do something. Are you going to call for Saitama? Another hero? Or maybe the Hero Association itself?</p>\n<p>Sonic can feel the corners of his lips drawing into a wide, excited grin. He\u2019s tempted to cover his mouth, to hide his bad habit, but then he sees the warm tint spreading across your cheeks. Do you <em>like</em> it\u2026when his bad habit gets the best of him like this?</p>\n<p>Your gaze shifts to the cellphone in your hand, your head tilting slightly. Rather than open your contact list and scroll to the name of some hero or the Hero Association, you just slip your phone into your pocket. Despite the blush spreading across your face to your ears, you focus on Sonic with a look of resolve. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone that I want to call right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyebrows lift and Sonic leans a little closer to you. Paying no mind to the people moving past you both on the sidewalk, the traffic on the street behind him. Of course, part of him is a little disappointed because he\u2019d hoped you would call for Saitama. Though he can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s pleased that you don\u2019t want to leave him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? It would be so easy, wouldn\u2019t it? All you would have to do is call for him and I\u2019m sure that Saitama would come to your rescue. Go ahead. Call him. Or you can call for-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally. I don\u2019t want to call anyone. Can we keep walking? I want to know what the surprise is.\u201d You\u2019re firm when you say this. Holding his gaze and feeling your pulse rapidly accelerate at the sight of the hint of pink dusting his cheeks.</p>\n<p>You really have lost your mind, haven\u2019t you? Honestly, you know you should call for help. At the very least, you could try to run right now or let the people around you know that something is wrong. Still, you don\u2019t, but you\u2019re rewarded for your loyalty.</p>\n<p>Sonic starts walking again, but his hand takes yours. Not holding it in a tight, threatening grip. No, it\u2019s more like he\u2019s doing this to gage your reaction. His thumb rubs against the back of your hand, his grin settling into a satisfied smile as he seems to decide that he likes this.</p>\n<p>Weren\u2019t you supposed to be a hostage? He grabbed you to use as bait to lure Saitama to him for a fight and yet he hasn\u2019t treated you like a captive since the second day. Now it\u2019s more like you\u2019re just his partner, almost.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s actually pretty nice. Living with Sonic, you haven\u2019t had to worry about your job and cycling through the dangerous ghost town to deliver food to Saitama. You haven\u2019t had to feel like a third wheel at the apartment you share with your friend and her boyfriend. Honestly, getting kidnapped might\u2019ve been the best thing that could\u2019ve happened to you.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it comes as such a disappointment when you suddenly spot Saitama on the other side of the street. Your heart sinks into your stomach and every muscle tenses because you know what\u2019s about to happen. Saitama is already crossing the road and calls out that he\u2019s here to rescue you.</p>\n<p>This is what Sonic has been waiting for. The grin that spreads across his face almost looks like it could split his face entirely. The grip on your hand tightens for just a second before it releases and he lifts you in his arms. He\u2019s pleased that he\u2019s finally going to get the fight he wanted, but he\u2019s not going to risk you being taken from him. Sprinting off, he begins searching for somewhere to hide you until the fight is over.</p>\n<p>You should <em>want</em> to be saved, right? In the traditional context of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d, it\u2019s obviously bad that you were kidnapped and held hostage by a ninja that is definitely lacking in sanity. Common sense would say that you should want to be rescued and returned to your normal life. You should be looking forward to going back to your shared apartment and running deliveries for restaurants, working towards your goal of getting your own place to live.</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s what \u201ccommon sense\u201d dictates\u2026well, you\u2019re definitely losing your mind. As the city speeds past you and you feel Sonic\u2019s arms tightly holding you against his chest, you can\u2019t help hoping that Saitama doesn\u2019t catch up to him. The idea of returning to your old life might have been what you wanted at first, but now the thought fills you with dread.</p>\n<p>Imagining the long hours spent cycling through the city, delivering to people that are often unappreciative or even just plain rude. The thought of bringing a delivery to Saitama\u2019s place, having Genos scold you like you\u2019re a child because the restaurant gave him disposable chopsticks with flowers printed on the wrapper instead of dragons. Trudging into your apartment at the end of the day to find your friend and her boyfriend making out on the couch, reminding you of your own loneliness.</p>\n<p>No way! Not a chance in hell! Your arms wrap around Sonic\u2019s neck and you lean up to shout over his shoulder at Saitama. \u201cNo thanks!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019s so much closer than you\u2019d expected. That expressionless face inches from yours, a red-gloved hand lifted in preparation to grab Sonic by the back of his shirt.</p>\n<p>Sonic spins around quickly, leaping backwards to keep Saitama in his line of sight while putting distance between you and him. \u201cYou finally showed up-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSaitama-san, you can go home! I don\u2019t want to be rescued, but thank you for trying!\u201d You shout this to him, hoping that he will shrug it off and leave. Having delivered to his place so often and killed time in the evenings gaming with him, you feel like you know him well enough. If Saitama doesn\u2019t <em>need</em> to bother with something, he won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The hero\u2019s head tilts, an eyebrow raising. The wind whips at his cape and with him standing on the edge of a rooftop, he would almost look heroic if it wasn\u2019t for his face. His expression holds that blandness that you\u2019ve become so accustomed to seeing. Like nothing in the world can surprise him or impress him. \u201cYou\u2026<em>don\u2019t</em> want me to rescue you?\u201d</p>\n<p>His hand curls into a fist and he smacks it against his other palm. \u201cOh! I get it. Sorry, but I still have to rescue you, Delivery-chan. If you and Sonic are dating then you have each other\u2019s numbers, right? You can still hang out, but you need to get back to your job. It\u2019s been a few days and you\u2019re the only person that will bring deliveries to the ghost town.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sonic cocks his head to the side, intentionally to the opposite side of Saitama\u2019s tilt. His large gray eyes narrow on the hero as he moves so that you\u2019re draped over his shoulder. One arm wraps around your waist, a hand pinning you on his shoulder by pressing at your lower back. The ninja\u2019s free hand reaches behind him to begin sliding his blade from its sheath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what \u201cdeliveries\u201d is a euphemism for, but you\u2019re not going to take her. I gave you a specific time, date, and location for our fight, but you never showed up. I even did you the courtesy of returning to that spot for a few days in a row.\u201d The corners of his lips begin to draw back and upward, his bad habit getting the best of him as exhilaration brings his pulse to a rapid flutter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of hero can\u2019t even follow simple instructions? You\u2019re just lucky that I didn\u2019t take off her head and leave it on your doorstep as a consolation prize,\u201d he continues, leaning on one hip. \u201cWhat would your precious Hero Association think if they knew that-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? You wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d Saitama takes a few steps closer, a bland little smile settling on his face. Almost as if to taunt him. \u201cI knew Delivery-chan was safe with you. You\u2019re always watching over her when she goes through the ghost town, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>The mental whiplash that you\u2019re going through right now. Sonic\u2026really has to be crazy, on some level, to think that \u201cdeliveries\u201d is a euphemism for something else. What could it mean other than delivering food? Not to mention what Saitama just said. He knew that you\u2019d been kidnapped and didn\u2019t save you because he knew that Sonic had been watching you?!</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, since you finally decided to show your face, why don\u2019t you give me the fight that you skipped out on before?\u201d Sonic sets you down on your feet beside him and whips out his katana, pointing the end at Saitama. The grin spreading across his face makes it look like it could split it in half.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s\u2026completely out of his mind, isn\u2019t he? You take a few steps back, your eyes flicking from Sonic to Saitama. All three of you are on a rooftop so it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to hide anywhere. While you really don\u2019t want to go back to the life you had, you\u2019re also questioning Sonic\u2019s sanity more than before.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I fight you, you have to promise not to take Delivery-chan again. I don\u2019t care if you guys hang out, but if she goes missing then I won\u2019t get to eat delivery anymore. Deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should I have to agree to your terms? You didn\u2019t even show up when you were supposed to! Maybe if you had, then you would\u2019ve\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Their voices fade into the background as you find a fire escape and slip away. Taking the stairs a few at a time, hopping down to the landing below with a quiet clanging. You chance a look above you, but there\u2019s no sign of the hero or the ninja so you keep moving. Though you don\u2019t really have a plan for when you reach the ground.</p>\n<p>Going back to the apartment you share with your friend just sounds miserable at this point. If you go back with Sonic, now you\u2019ll have to worry about possibly getting \u201crescued\u201d just so you can deliver food. Not to mention the fact that you\u2019re beginning to realize that the ninja you\u2019ve grown so close to is just as insane as you\u2019d first suspected.</p>\n<p>If you hide somewhere\u2026but <em>where</em>? What will you do if either of them catch up to you? You know how fast Sonic is and Genos has endlessly spoken praises about Saitama\u2019s abilities. Running might not work so if you can just find a good place to hide, you should be fine.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking when you feel the metal begin to tremble beneath your feet. The crash comes so soon afterwards that you barely have time to register that you\u2019re falling. The metal crumples and you begin to plummet toward the ground over the railing, a body slamming against yours.</p>\n<p>A hand snatches you by the arm and you find yourself being tucked against Sonic\u2019s chest as he twists. The ninja lands on his feet with a catlike grace, holding you in his arms with a hint of triumph in his eyes. \u201cAnd where did you think <em>you</em> were going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Strands of dark hair are hanging around his face, over his eyes. His usual topknot messy and just barely holding itself together, the neck of his shirt torn. He has a few scrapes on his neck and cheek, but from what you can see, he\u2019s otherwise okay. Which is honestly astounding considering the fact that he was slammed through several layers of the fire escape.</p>\n<p>You grip his shirt as you look up, expecting to see Saitama watching from the rooftop. Instead, you find him peering at you from over Sonic\u2019s shoulder. Adrenaline shoots through you, cold and piercing, and you squirm. The ninja immediately leaps forward and twists around to face Saitama again, his expression shifting from a taunting smirk to something closer to frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we finish this? Let\u2019s leave Y/N out of this and focus on the fight. She doesn\u2019t want to go back to her old life.\u201d Sonic can feel the excitement, the satisfaction, of revealing all of this to the hero in front of him. Anticipating the moment that it will all sink in and disappointment will take over his features.</p>\n<p>Finally, Saitama\u2019s expression shifts. His brow furrowing, his mouth turning down slightly at the corners. \u201cOh. I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you finally understand-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour name\u2019s been Y/N this whole time? I\u2019ve always called you \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d.\u201d He isn\u2019t looking at Sonic, but at you. His expression was so serious for all of a few seconds, but now it\u2019s back to that deadpan look you\u2019re used to seeing. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sonic decides to try again. Determined to fight Saitama, feeling certain that with you there, he can\u2019t possibly lose. He\u2019s going to defeat the hero that he declared his rival and maybe you can help him celebrate when you\u2019re back at the base. \u201cIf you finally understand, then why don\u2019t you-?\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of his sentence dies on his tongue as his knees fold beneath him and he tumbles to the ground. One strike to the side of the neck. That\u2019s all it took for the inhumanly fast ninja to go down. Saitama doesn\u2019t even seem phased by it, which is almost more alarming than the simple fact that Sonic was beaten so easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops. Uh, here.\u201d Saitama grabs your arm to steady you when you almost go down with Sonic. \u201cWe should probably go before he wakes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shaking your head, you stumble back a few steps, but he doesn\u2019t release your sleeve. \u201cI said that I didn\u2019t want to be rescued!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? I thought you were joking. Wait, why don\u2019t you want to be rescued? What did you guys do?\u201d He leans closer, but his face doesn\u2019t betray any sort of emotion at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-nothing. I just\u2026I said that I don\u2019t want to go back so-!\u201d You\u2019re a little mad at yourself for not guessing what he would do. It\u2019s effortless for him to lift you over his shoulder and soon you see Sonic\u2019s unconscious form fading into the distance.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s your first day back to work after Saitama \u201crescued\u201d you. This isn\u2019t where you want to be; standing in an udon restaurant and waiting for an order to be finished. You\u2019re scrolling through stuff on your phone, checking for any posts about monster sightings in City Z.</p>\n<p>Honestly, you\u2019re surprised that you still have a job. After just disappearing for a few days without a word, most companies probably would\u2019ve fired you. On top of that, apparently a <em>certain someone</em> filed a complaint about you the same day that you were abducted. Something about you not bringing plastic silverware along with chopsticks.</p>\n<p>Happy Delivery Company only agreed to keep you because a <em>certain someone</em> explained the situation to your manager. You know that this\u2026<em>certain someone</em>\u2026only did it because you\u2019re the only one who will deliver to City Z\u2019s ghost town. If you were fired, no one would be able to deliver food to that <em>certain someone</em> and his mentor.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re not going to thank Genos for doing what he did. Did he save you from getting fired? Yes. Did he also file a complaint against you? Yes. Half the time, it really feels like he\u2019s trying to get you fired, but Saitama must have said something to make him decide you\u2019re important enough to help.</p>\n<p>Of course, your workplace was pretty alarmed when they heard that you\u2019d been kidnapped. Even more alarmed when they learned how often you encounter monsters during your deliveries to the ghost town. Rather than decide to just stop delivering to the ghost town, the company owner decided to make special accommodations for you to \u201cmake your job easier\u201d.</p>\n<p>At this point, you almost wish that you\u2019d been fired. The helmet is fine enough, but it\u2019s the other protective gear that makes you feel ridiculous. You were given a thicker hoodie with built-in padding on the elbows and shoulders, along the forearms. Knee pads and thin shin pads to protect your legs. Though you still need to replace your stun gun, your boss was kind enough to supply you with an alternative form of self-defense: a kitchen knife with a sheath for your belt.</p>\n<p>They probably thought that you\u2019d be grateful, but really, this is a pain. People have been staring at you all day and you know how it looks. You look like a hero wannabe. You look like you built your own costume and you\u2019re a Mumen Rider fangirl. Honestly, you look <em>insane</em>.</p>\n<p>Once you have the order, you step outside and approach your new bike. Another gift from the delivery company. It has thicker rubber on the tires, a lighter frame meant to let you move faster. The basket on the front bears an image of the company logo that reads \u201cHappy Delivery Company\u201d and features a cartoonish owl.</p>\n<p>The bag is set into your basket and you ignore the stares of the people around you. This is your last delivery of the day. Once this is over, you can go back home and get back to this stupid, boring cycle. Work, go home, work, go home. Coworkers, customers, Saitama and Genos\u2026but no Sonic.</p>\n<p>Pedaling off down the street, your brow furrows. You haven\u2019t seen Sonic since the day that Saitama \u201crescued\u201d you and you know you should be relieved. You should feel happy to get back to your life, to get away from the crazy guy that abducted you. You <em>should</em>\u2026but you don\u2019t. In fact, you find yourself glancing over your shoulder frequently with the hope that you might see him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not Stockholm syndrome, is it? No, it\u2019s more like you\u2019re grateful for him opening your eyes to an alternative life. You miss waking up next to him and spending the day with Sonic. Watching him train and take care of his blades, eating his cooking, talking to him about things other than work or your stupid, boring life. You talked about your interests, about the dreams you\u2019d had, and you learned a lot about him, too.</p>\n<p>Reaching an intersection, you brake gently and stare at the red light. Waiting and wishing. Even if you <em>want</em> to see Sonic again, you have no idea where to find him. You never really had the chance to memorize where his \u201cbase\u201d is.</p>\n<p>Movement at the corner of your eyes makes you tense up and for a moment, you think it\u2019s him. A turn of your head fills you with disappointment. Beside you, another cyclist is waiting for the light to change. Of course, the long wait gives him time to look you up and down, which makes you flush a warm hue with embarrassment. You face forward, trying to hide your blush, but it\u2019s futile.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s great gear!\u201d Mumen Rider\u2019s voice tugs your eyes in his direction again. He has the sweetest, most genuine smile on his face when you look his way and he gives you a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026thanks.\u201d It\u2019s embarrassing, so embarrassing, because you can hear pedestrians on the sidewalk saying things. You can see from the edge of your vision that someone has their cellphone out and they\u2019re taking pictures. You do not want to be here, do not want to become a spectacle like this, and it\u2019s so tempting to just pedal off and hope you can dodge traffic.</p>\n<p>The second that the light changes, you\u2019re pedaling as fast as you can to escape the awkwardness. It isn\u2019t that you have anything against him; Mumen Rider is one of the nicest guys around. It just feels like that \u201cwearing the same outfit\u201d kind of situation. Like you\u2019re imitating him or something.</p>\n<p>From a distance, Sonic watches the interaction between you and that other hero. With narrowed gray eyes, he contemplates going after him. Look at you. You have a new outfit and it looks like you modeled it after that hero\u2019s. How much did that run the Hero Association? Or did you pay for it yourself?</p>\n<p>You must be a pretty big fan to want to emulate his look. Sonic crouches at the edge of a roof, his gaze going from you as you ride off to focus on the hero. Look at that smug smile on his face as he rides behind you at a leisurely pace. He looks so pleased with himself.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a while since Sonic has been able to go out so he hasn\u2019t been able to see you. Confined to his base, nursing his wounds, building up his strength for when he gets his revenge. He hoped that your time together would have changed your mind about being a hero, but it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re set in your ways. No, you still want to put on a costume and play hero, don\u2019t you?</p>\n<p>If you want to play hero so badly, then he\u2019s just going to have to play along as your nemesis. A grin tugs at the corners of his mouth, spreading across his face as he sets his sights on you again. Just how much will you be able to handle if he keeps hammering away at you? If he chips away at your resolve and makes your hero life hell, you\u2019ll eventually see things his way.</p>\n<p>Sonic follows behind you at a laidback pace, keeping you within his line of sight. He already knows where you\u2019re going. It\u2019s that time of day, isn\u2019t it? That time of day that you pay Saitama a visit.</p>\n<p>He imagines how excited you must be to show off your new hero costume and he considers doing something cruel. What if he launched a barrage of shuriken and shredded your gear? What if he made a bunch of rips and tears in your clothes? By the time you\u2019d reach Saitama, your hero costume would be in tatters.</p>\n<p>That might be entertaining, but he doesn\u2019t like the idea of someone else seeing you that way. He\u2019s been thinking about your time together in the shower, the day he\u2019s sure you\u2019d planned to find and use your stun gun n him again. Remembering how it felt to have you pressed against him, how you felt on the inside, how your voice sounded when you came undone around him.</p>\n<p>The thought of anyone else getting to see you like that, getting to experience you on that same level of intimacy, ignites a fire in him. He can\u2019t let it happen, won\u2019t let it happen. When you come back with him next time, it\u2019s going to be permanent. You\u2019ll thank him for liberating you from the Hero Association\u2019s control.</p>\n<p>As you enter the ghost town, you\u2019re wondering how soon you could find another job if you quit this one. Saitama and Genos might be upset, but your safety and sanity are a little more important, right? Besides, how are you supposed to protect yourself from monsters when all you have is a kitchen knife?</p>\n<p>The problem is that you need money. If you quit without a plan, your friend is going to be upset that you can\u2019t contribute towards rent or groceries. Her boyfriend might even say she should kick you out. Being unemployed isn\u2019t really an option right now.</p>\n<p>Damn. You can hear the loud thud of slow footsteps further down the road, around a corner. Lifting off the bike seat, you pedal faster and keep your eyes locked on the area where the sound is coming from. Bracing yourself for a monster attack, trying to determine how quickly you can unsheathe that knife if you need to use it against a monster.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the thing is slow moving. A rather large, bulky frame covered in pulsing sacks of jelly. The large eyes blink at you one at a time as they seem to try to figure out what you are. Honestly\u2026this monster seems more confused than aggressive. You take advantage of that and just keep pedaling in the direction of Saitama\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p>By the time you get there, your lungs are burning a bit. The bike is left leaning against the front of the building and you take the stairs two at a time, wanting to get this over with. You double-checked that everything from the order is in the bag, made sure to get the right chopsticks along with plastic silverware, grabbed some extra condiments for the udon, even paid out of pocket for a bit of extra meat. All so that Genos won\u2019t have any reason to be upset.</p>\n<p>You reach Saitama\u2019s floor and that\u2019s when your pace slows down. A sigh slipping past your lips as you pause to lean against the wall beside a door. What kind of life is this? You\u2019re working toward the goal of getting your own place, but what then? You\u2019ll just keep doing deliveries forever?</p>\n<p>Dealing with rude customers and coworkers, dodging monsters while on the job, delivering to people that may or may not be trying to get your fired. Even if you have your own place, what does that mean? Just that you\u2019ll have the place to yourself when you get home; that\u2019s the only difference. So what do you really want? What would actually make you <em>happy</em>?</p>\n<p>The door to Saitama\u2019s unit opens and the bald hero pops his head outside. \u201cOh. There you are, Delivery-chan.\u201d He steps out onto the walkway, scratching at his stomach beneath his t-shirt. Raising an eyebrow, he tilts his head to the side. \u201cUh\u2026you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I\u2019m fine. Sorry about that. I\u2019ve got your order.\u201d You can see his eyes lower from your face to take in your outfit and blood rushes to your face. Don\u2019t say anything. Please don\u2019t say anything. If Saitama says something about your outfit, it\u2019ll be too much.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that Mumen Rider cosplay?\u201d he asks with a dead serious expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you joking?!\u201d Taking quick steps forward, you hold out the bag to him and let your lips settle into a frown. \u201cHere. Just take your order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you still mad at me for saving you?\u201d He takes the delivery bag from you, rubbing at the back of his head with his free hand. \u201cIf you and Sonic are a thing, then don\u2019t you have his number? If you really want to hang out with him, you should just call him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026thinking about quitting my job so this is probably going to be the last delivery you can get.\u201d It\u2019s blurted out and you look away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Why? Are you really that mad at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about that,\u201d you reply, sighing. Shoving your hands into your pockets, you turn your gaze to Saitama again. \u201cI\u2019m just sick of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already rummaging around in the bag, a pair of disposable chopsticks hanging from the corner of his mouth. \u201cOh. Uh\u2026you wanna talk about it? You can tell me about it while I\u2019m eating and then we can play a few rounds in this fighting game that I borrowed from King. We\u2019re your last delivery of the day, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>All you can do is nod. Why not? Of all of the people you could rant to, why not rant to someone that you definitely know won\u2019t repeat it? After all, you\u2019re pretty sure Saitama won\u2019t really be paying attention. \u201cI guess\u2026that would be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t like him to get distracted. It\u2019s <em>unprofessional</em>. In his line of work, he can\u2019t afford distractions. He wasn\u2019t brought up to allow anything to steal his attention away from his objective, which is what makes this all the more frustrating.</p>\n<p>He should have followed you instead of letting his curiosity get the better of him. Pursuing that hero on the bike was a mistake, but he just couldn\u2019t shake the thought that you preferred <em>him</em> over Sonic. Why would you? Anyone can see that Sonic is stronger than him, smarter than him, better in every way!</p>\n<p>Is it because he\u2019s a <em>hero</em>? Is it about trying to raise your rank? That\u2019s what the Hero Association pushes, right? Raise your rank, raise your class, play nice and follow all of their rules. Just like Saitama.</p>\n<p>Sonic followed him for longer than he meant to, but he wanted to know what makes this man so special that you\u2019d want to emulate him with your new hero suit. It didn\u2019t take him long to determine that this guy is a lower class hero. He doesn\u2019t ride around looking for monsters to fight or searching for challenges; he\u2019s just looking for anyone that needs help. Even if it\u2019s carrying groceries for an old lady, helping a kid get their cat out of a tree, frantically chasing down someone\u2019s hat for them after the wind blew it off.</p>\n<p>That hero poses no threat to him. He can\u2019t even compare to him! Sonic should feel reassured of that when he finally leaves to search for you again. He just can\u2019t shake the thought that you might have a crush on that hero.</p>\n<p>You were blushing when you spoke to him, at that traffic light. Sonic saw you blush often enough that he can easily spot it when the warm tint starts spreading across your face. Just what were you thinking about when you were talking to him? Were you hoping that he was going to compliment your new look? Did you want him to ask if you would pair up with him?</p>\n<p>Jealousy leaves a bad taste in his mouth and he changes course. You\u2019re in the ghost town, aren\u2019t you? It <em>is</em> that time of day, isn\u2019t it? Time for you to visit Saitama. He\u2019s just going to have to wait outside for you to finish.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re not getting away from him again. A grin tugs at the corners of his lips and he can feel his excitement replacing his jealousy. Once he gets you back, you won\u2019t be seeing that hero anymore. He thought that he made you realize it before, but this time he\u2019s going to make it clear; you should abandon your job as a hero.</p>\n<p>While Sonic is rapidly making his way to the ghost town, you\u2019re sitting on the floor in Saitama\u2019s apartment and waiting for some sort of reaction. After pouring your heart out about everything you\u2019ve been through, everything that\u2019s been bothering you, he\u2019s as deadpan as ever. You\u2019re not sure why you expected any sort of reaction from him.</p>\n<p>Really, this was more about letting it all out. It\u2019s not like you can talk to your friend about it; she would think you\u2019re out of your mind. She would say that you should appreciate the fact that you have a job and a place to live. You\u2019re not sure anyone can really sympathize with what you\u2019re going through.</p>\n<p>The first person to actually comment is Genos. Across the table, he points his chopsticks at you. \u201cYou are complaining that your job as a delivery girl is boring and that your goal is to obtain your own apartment. Have you considered becoming a hero?\u201d</p>\n<p>You choke on the water you were drinking and wipe your mouth on your sleeve. \u201cWhat?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that came out of nowhere, Genos.\u201d Saitama speaks through a mouthful of noodles, turning his bland gaze away from his food to look at the cyborg.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery-chan said that she\u2019s tired of the life that she has, but she doesn\u2019t know how to change it. If she became a hero, even a hero at the lowest level, it would give her the opportunity to pursue other things while continuing to work and make an income. As long as she fought one monster a week, she could maintain her level and continue to be paid by the Hero Association. And if she were to join a higher level hero when they fight a monster, the Hero Association could raise her rank by association.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Like an exp share in Pok\u00e9mon, right? I don\u2019t know, though. If Delivery-chan became a hero, she wouldn\u2019t be able to make deliveries here anymore. We\u2019d have to go to the restaurant ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re talking as if you\u2019re not sitting right there with them. Tapping a fingernail against the plastic water bottle in your hand, you find yourself actually considering what Genos said. Class C heroes <em>do</em> get a decent amount of pay, right? And you only have to fight one monster a week? If you tagged along with one of them when they fight a monster, it\u2019d be easy enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if I can\u2019t pass the exams to become a hero? I\u2019m not an athlete; I\u2019m just a delivery person,\u201d you finally speak up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fought monsters before,\u201d Saitama argues.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith a <em>stun gun</em>! That makes a huge difference, if you\u2019re fighting them with a weapon versus fighting them bare-handed! And that\u2019s not even accounting for the boost you get from adrenaline when you\u2019re in a real fight!\u201d It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s actually impossible, right? Shaking your head, you feel dumb for even considering it.</p>\n<p>He looks faintly confused, tilting his head to the side. \u201cOh. I guess you\u2019re right. I\u2019m always pretty much at full power so I didn\u2019t think about how adrenaline probably helps you out. Maybe there\u2019s some way you can trick yourself during the physical exam? Like you can make yourself think you\u2019re actually fighting a monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a solution.\u201d Genos waits for you both to look his way before he sets down his phone on the table. On the screen, you can all see a paused video that shows you in a semi-crouch with your stun gun in your hand. \u201cI have a few examples that I can send to the Hero Association. I am Class S so I might be able to recommend you for Class C. However, I won\u2019t do this for free.\u201d</p>\n<p>You make the mistake of lifting your eyes from the phone screen and find his gold and black eyes narrowed. The intensity of his unblinking stare makes you tense up, makes your throat tight. \u201cWhy do you have videos of me fighting monsters? And what would I have to do for you to vouch for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>With absolutely no shame, Genos replies. \u201cI was recording you in case you were late delivering our food. If you were late and our food was cold, I intended to send the footage to your manager as well as file a complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I got fired, I wouldn\u2019t be able to deliver your food. Why does it feel like you\u2019re trying to make me lose my job?\u201d You\u2019ve managed to not confront him about it for quite a while, worrying that Genos would finally just demand that your company fires you. Now\u2026you don\u2019t really care about the job anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sensei deserves the best and if you are unable to provide it, then it would be logical to file a complaint. It was my hope that Happy Delivery Company might replace you if you continued to prove your incompetence, but now I understand that they have no intention of doing so. You are the only one that is semi-capable of making deliveries to the ghost town and that is why I am willing to help you obtain a Class C ranking with the Hero Association. If you are employed by the Hero Association, you will only be expected to fight a monster once a week. This will mean that you have ample free time to do as you please, but this includes making deliveries for myself and my sensei. In exchange for helping you become a hero, I expect your full cooperation. If I call you and ask for something, you will need to bring it and fulfill your obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t take a single breath through all of that. If he was fully human, you might actually be a little impressed. Resting your chin in your hand, you consider what he just told you. Of course, you\u2019ve already experienced his bossiness firsthand so you\u2019re hesitant to agree to his on-call delivery girl. At the same time, what he\u2019s offering doesn\u2019t sound that bad.</p>\n<p>If you only have to worry about a monster once a week and your only other obligation is running deliveries for Genos, that could mean having a lot of potential free time. You\u2019d be able to do whatever you want between jobs. You could probably take some classes if you wanted to or you could try to get back into some old hobbies. You could even take a nice, long nap or enjoy some time just relaxing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow often will you need me to run deliveries?\u201d You glance over at Saitama to see if he has any reaction to the fact that Genos seems to have really thought this through. The bald hero has completely left the conversation and now he\u2019s focused on his udon again.</p>\n<p>The cyborg hero simply stares back at you in silence for a moment. Not as if he\u2019s considering the answer to your question, but as if he expects you to take back the question altogether. Like the fact that you asked such a thing is completely inappropriate. When you don\u2019t shrink back and tell him to disregard it, Genos crosses his arms on the table in front of him and frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t something I can answer at this time. I may need multiple favors in one day or there may be days where your services won\u2019t be needed.\u201d He seems to sense your hesitation and, desperate to keep a delivery person on-hand in case Saitama wants something, he decides to offer more. \u201cIf I do need you to make multiple deliveries in one day, I will reimburse you by bringing you with me if I fight higher threat level monsters so that you can reap the benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s now that Saitama decides to chime in again. \u201cOh, right! If you get into Class B or higher, you don\u2019t have to worry about fighting monsters every week. That\u2019s pretty generous, Genos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Leaning forward, his eyes narrowed on you after having briefly flicked toward Saitama, Genos brings his face closer to yours. \u201cDelivery-chan. Do we have a deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>Being a part-time delivery girl for a couple of heroes. Would that be better than dealing with everything you put with up at your current job? Being a part-time hero, part-time delivery girl\u2026could give you free time. It might even be interesting! And the only mean customer you\u2019ll have to deal with is Genos, but Saitama isn\u2019t so bad! So should you accept his offer?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too early in the morning for this. The air feels cold against your face as you slip out of the apartment and make your way to where your bike is locked up. Yawning, your body still in the process of registering the fact that you\u2019re outside instead of still settled in the warmth of your bed.</p>\n<p>How long has it been since you\u2019ve gone out this early? The sun is barely up as you pedal off down the street in your gear. You\u2019re actually glad for how well it covers you and you almost wish you had a visor to protect your face from the chilled wind. Fatigue threatens to pull your eyelids shut, threatens to make you nod off while you wait for a traffic light to change.</p>\n<p>Genos\u2026is a <em>monster</em>. That\u2019s the only thing going through your head right now. More prominent than any thoughts about how cold it is, how tired you are, how your stomach is growling. No, Genos is an absolute monster to set the meetup time so early in the morning.</p>\n<p>Does he sleep? Does he <em>need</em> to sleep? You almost wonder if he just spends the night sitting at the end of Saitama\u2019s futon, watching his mentor sleep and maybe even recording it on his phone for research purposes. It still makes you shudder, knowing that he had been recording your fights with monsters.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a few days since you agreed to the arrangement with Genos and he\u2019s still waiting on confirmation that the Hero Association will grant you a rank and class. That\u2019s why it was such a surprise to get a text from him yesterday, demanding that you meet up with him at this disgustingly early hour. You don\u2019t know what his intentions are, but after hearing the perks of a hero status, you can\u2019t risk losing this opportunity.</p>\n<p>A sudden rush of air against your left side makes you jolt and you grip the handlebars tighter, your eyes going wide. For a second, just a brief second, you swear that you saw a dark blur at your side. It was so quick that you weren\u2019t able to really see what it was, but it still sends your pulse accelerating.</p>\n<p>You stay still for a moment, staring off down the street and watching for another glimpse of it. The rest of the road is completely empty. The only thing you can hear this early in the morning is the wind that blows past you. Even though you seem to be alone, there\u2019s this anxious feeling in your stomach.</p>\n<p>Adrenaline pumps through your veins as you begin to pedal again, drawing closer to the ghost town. Nervousness has you biting the inside of your cheek and you keep glancing around. Was it Sonic? You\u2019ve seen how fast he can move so it feels possible. If it was him, he would\u2019ve stopped, right?</p>\n<p>Part of you wants it to be him, wants to see him again. Another part of you knows that you need to keep your distance. He\u2019s kind of crazy, isn\u2019t he? Kind of <em>dangerous</em>. So if you want to become a hero, if you want any chance at making a good life for yourself, you should probably avoid him.</p>\n<p>When you finally get close to the meetup spot, you can see Genos standing on the sidewalk and looking at his phone screen. You don\u2019t even have to ask him what he\u2019s doing; you know he\u2019s checking the time. As you dismount from your bike and roll it along at your side, you know what he\u2019s going to say before he says it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are late.\u201d It\u2019s not spoken in a lecturing manner, but just in a matter of fact sort of tone. Almost as if he suspects that you weren\u2019t aware of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Genos. I\u2019m not used to waking up this early.\u201d You put down the kickstand and settle your bike near a dented lamp post. Nervousness drives you to push your hands into your pockets, your tongue anxiously running along your bottom lip as you approach him. \u201cDid you need me to run a delivery? Or-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all, you need to correct the way you speak to me.\u201d Genos plants his hands on his hips, making his irritation clear. Those gold and black eyes narrow as he makes the last few steps to close the distance between you.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026what?\u201d Tilting your head, you stare back at him with a tightness in your abdomen. The sense of dread that you\u2019ve come to feel every time you\u2019re face to face with the embodiment of entitlement.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I am going to help you grow stronger and raise your rank, you will refer to me as your superior. From this day forward, you must refer to me as your senpai.\u201d All of this comes out so smoothly, so <em>practiced</em>, that you can\u2019t help wondering if he had this lecture prepared and was just waiting for the chance to break it out.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tension hanging in the air between you. A feeling of indignation on your side as the cyborg hero oozes superiority. As if he\u2019s somehow triumphed over you by making himself your teacher, by making you rely on him in order to become a hero. The idea of calling him \u201csenpai\u201d brings a bitter taste to your mouth, but his stare in unwavering and you know he won\u2019t back down on this. You\u2019ve been caught in hour-long arguments with him over way less important things.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was late\u2026Genos-senpai,\u201d you mumble, feeling a hint of warmth rise to your cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time, you should leave your apartment an hour before our meeting time. I would prefer it if you arrive early instead of making me wait.\u201d His mouth sets into a frown as he leans a little closer, his hands still resting on his hips. \u201cDo you understand, Delivery-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s <em>still</em> calling you that. Though your name tag is in full view on the jacket of your uniform, Genos has either decided to ignore it or he somehow can\u2019t read it. Either way, it seems like the name \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d is going to stick with you.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t be late again.\u201d Agreeing to placate him, but knowing that what he\u2019s asking for is absolutely insane. The sun is still rising at this point. If you woke up any earlier, you\u2019d be riding into the ghost town in the dark. \u201cSo\u2026why did you want to meet up? Did you need me to run an errand for you or-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d His expression is unreadable as he continues to study you for a moment. \u201cI received the results of the Hero Association\u2019s review. I wanted to present them to you before we begin your training. Of course, I have already looked at the letter in order to determine the level of training you will need. I have developed the perfect training program in order to boost your rank to an adequate level, however, as my sensei\u2019s disciple, I must also continue to raise your rank and push you as far as possible. A ranking below Class S for a student of his student is unacceptable\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Saitama\u2019s disciple talks too much. Sonic tilts his head, crouched far above you both on a rooftop. He didn\u2019t get the chance to approach you last time because he was called away for a job, but he made sure that he had today free so he could try again. You won\u2019t be getting away this time. He\u2019s just waiting for the perfect moment to snatch you up.</p>\n<p>He could just do it now. What could that metal nuisance do to stop him? It would be so easy to just leap down, sling you over his shoulder, and make off with you before that cyborg could even lift a finger. What\u2019s stopping him is the fact that the Hero Association was mentioned.</p>\n<p>Just what are you doing here, meeting with this hero so early in the morning? Is he training you? Is he trying to raise your rank or class or whatever? Did your precious Hero Association slap you on the hand for letting yourself get captured? Is this supposed to be some kind of punishment?</p>\n<p>Your face makes him think that it is. The frown on your lips, the frustration in your eyes, the way you\u2019re hunching your shoulders. Oh, you don\u2019t like being lectured by a higher ranking hero? Are you <em>embarrassed</em>?</p>\n<p>The corners of his lips twitch before drawing back, a wide grin settling across his face. What would they think if they knew what you did? How would the Hero Association feel if they knew that you weren\u2019t just captured, but that you slept with a criminal like him? How badly would that effect their reputation?</p>\n<p>Staring down at you, Sonic notices that you\u2019re wearing that new hero costume again. Emulating that Class C hero Mumen Rider, probably hoping to impress him. His grin spreads even wider as he wonders how you\u2019d feel if you knew that he memorized Mumen Rider\u2019s patrol route. How would you feel if you knew that he found where the hero lives?</p>\n<p>Is Saitama\u2019s disciple <em>still</em> talking? His grin begins to fade because it\u2019s been a solid five minutes of lecturing and the cyborg\u2019s mouth hasn\u2019t stopped moving once. You\u2019re beginning to shift your weight a little as he leans closer and when he tilts his head, you jolt and give him a quiet response to whatever he just asked.</p>\n<p>Seeming satisfied with your answer, Genos finally has the faintest smile on his face. \u201cAlright. Now that we have an agreement, I will show you the results of the Hero Association\u2019s review. I made sure to send them the videos that best demonstrate your abilities and I believe that my written testament may have had an effect on their decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWritten testament?\u201d Seeing him draw an envelope from his back pocket, you move to stand beside him and watch as he opens it. The paper inside is neatly folded and you can see the logo for the Hero Association printed on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I wanted to ensure that you would receive an adequate ranking so I made sure to inform the Hero Association that you are at least semi-capable in a monster fight. I described your fights in great detail and provided them with an analysis of your current abilities as well as your measurements.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy\u2026my measurements?\u201d There\u2019s a warmth rising to your face upon hearing him say that. Not quite sure why they would need that information or why Genos would have that information to begin with.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t reply and simply unfolds the paper. \u201cI believe that this warrants your appreciation,\u201d he says, almost <em>proudly</em>, as he presents the results to you.</p>\n<p>Your eyes first go to the logo and then the beginning of the letter. How they, unfortunately, address you as \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d. He didn\u2019t give them your real name? And they didn\u2019t just toss the recommendation in the trash?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s when you see that big letter \u201cB\u201d that you feel like your heart leaps into your throat. There\u2019s a slight tremble to your hands when you take the letter from him. Class B? You\u2026really got put in Class B? It\u2019s a low ranking in Class B, but it\u2019s still way better than you expected! You were sure you\u2019d be lucky to get Class C!</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d you mutter, looking up from the letter to see that Genos is watching you. \u201cAll I did was fight off some monsters with a stun gun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as impressive as what I\u2019ve seen other-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou fought off monsters with a stun gun, which is more than what most civilians are capable of doing. After a careful analysis of your movements in the videos that I saved, I told the Hero Association that you show promise. This was by no means an exaggeration. I believe that with proper training, I can raise you to a rank that will make my sensei proud.\u201d A metal hand rests on your shoulder and he nods. \u201cI will make sure that you become stronger and reach your potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Did you get a new ranking?\u201d There\u2019s a taunting quality to the voice that speaks from beside your ear. When you jolt and try to move forward, you find yourself almost bumping your chest against Sonic\u2019s. His lips curve into a smirk as he looks you up and down, a light scoff at the sight of your gear.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is you. That pervert that keeps stalking my sensei.\u201d Genos tightens his grip on your shoulder and draws you just a bit closer before pushing you behind him. \u201cI will not let you bother him today and I will not let you steal my student again. Delivery-chan is my pupil as of today and it is my duty to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing with her.\u201d Sonic\u2019s large grey eyes focus on Genos and he slips a hand behind his back to reach for a weapon. \u201cYou\u2019re playing teacher now. Did Saitama tell you to train her? Or is this something you decided on your own?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes shift from Genos to look at where you\u2019re peering at him from behind the cyborg\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you begged for him to train you. I thought you were better than that, Y/N.\u201d</p>\n<p>You\u2019re at a loss for words. It\u2019s been days since you last saw him, days since Saitama \u201crescued\u201d you from him. The sight of him, the sound of his voice immediately remind you of all of the time you spent together and you begin to blush. Of course, you\u2019re also reminded that he\u2019s more than a little insane.</p>\n<p>Before you can say anything, before Sonic can continue taunting you, Genos lifts you over his shoulder. \u201cAs I said before, I will not let you steal my student again. I am taking Delivery-chan to begin her training and if you stalk us, I will have no choice but to eliminate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>You\u2019re pretty sure that Happy Delivery Company ordered your gear from wherever Mumen Rider gets his. After you got roughed up in the fight between Genos and Sonic, you\u2019re still surprised you don\u2019t have any broken bones. Just some scrapes and bruises, maybe a few contusions, but nothing too terrible.</p>\n<p>Genos wasn\u2019t even able to lose Sonic on his own; Saitama had to interfere. You\u2019re not sure how long that fight would\u2019ve gone on for if he hadn\u2019t stepped in. As you slouch at the table in Saitama\u2019s apartment, rubbing your injured cheek, you steal a glance in the hero\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>Saitama is lying on his futon, still wearing the t-shirt and sweatpants that he was wearing when he showed up earlier. Scratching absently at his stomach with one hand, holding a manga open with the other. He seemed almost annoyed earlier, but now he\u2019s acting like nothing happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery-chan, look at me.\u201d The command comes from beside you as Genos sits and he doesn\u2019t wait for you to obey. Metal fingertips grip your jaw to turn your head in his direction. The cyborg\u2019s face is so close to yours that you can clearly see the black sclera of his eyes, the fine cracks just at the edge of his face where it disappears beneath his hair.</p>\n<p>You try to lean back, but his fingers tighten on your jaw and he draws closer. As badly as you want to argue that he\u2019s too close, or at least insist that you\u2019re fine, he\u2019s holding your jaw too tightly. You won\u2019t be surprised if there are finger marks on your skin later.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is an abrasion on your cheek,\u201d Genos states, turning your head to the side a bit. As if he thinks that you can\u2019t feel the stinging pain of the scrape on the side of your face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, so, what happened back there?\u201d Saitama finally pushes himself to sit up, but he\u2019s still looking at the manga. \u201cI thought you were meeting up to start training today. So how did you end up in a fight with\u2026?\u201d His voice trails off and it\u2019s clear that he doesn\u2019t remember Sonic\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>Genos grimaces and his free hand reaches to the first aid kit on the table in front of him. \u201cMaster. That pervert attempted to abduct Delivery-chan for a second time. It was unclear what his motives were, but I refused to allow him to take her. As her senpai, it is my responsibility to protect Delivery-chan as well as teach her how to become a stronger hero. If needed, I would have incinerated him in order to protect her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s going a little overboard, don\u2019t you think? You don\u2019t want to end up in jail, Genos.\u201d Finally, the bald hero looks over at you both. \u201cSo did you get in an argument with him or something? I thought you were a thing now.\u201d</p>\n<p>You bite back a yelp when Genos cleans your scrape with an alcohol wipe. Nearly jolting backwards out of his grip. It\u2019s a bit hard to answer the question when you have this cyborg still holding onto your jaw and the look he\u2019s giving you is stern. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to clean and bandage the wound, but it certainly feels like a long time when he\u2019s staring at you that way. Unblinking, his eyes are unmoving in his hyper focus on your face.</p>\n<p>When he finally releases your jaw, there\u2019s a residual warmth on your skin from his metal fingertips and you immediately turn your head. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen Sonic since you\u2026\u201drescued\u201d\u2026me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeird. You seemed pretty close.\u201d It seemed like Saitama was going to say something else, but then he changed subjects. \u201cHey, Genos, what\u2019s for dinner tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI intend to make something special for tonight, to celebrate my first lesson with Delivery-chan. I still need to get the ingredients. I will take her shopping with me so I can teach her how to select the best produce and meat.\u201d</p>\n<p>More time with Genos. <em>Exactly</em> what you wanted after getting tossed around like a ragdoll during his fight with Sonic and then getting reprimanded for hanging out with a criminal. Despite him accusing Sonic of stalking you, Genos also seemed to believe that it was somehow your fault that the ninja was fixated on you.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the trip to the store was pretty uneventful. He did lecture you on how to pick the freshest vegetables and what meat Saitama prefers, but other than that, nothing weird happened. In fact, you could\u2019ve almost considered it peaceful\u2026if there weren\u2019t people staring at you both and coming up to ask for his autograph or asking to take a picture with him.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re prepping the vegetables for whatever Genos is planning to make, feeling a little irritated that you got dragged into helping prepare dinner for them, when you overhear something you wish something unsettling. At first, it just sounds like Genos is rambling to Saitama about something mundane, which wouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary. Then you hear him mention your nickname and you pay more attention to what\u2019s being said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery-chan was unable to fight without her weapon. After studying all of the footage and data that I have compiled regarding her fights with monsters, I determined that she will require weaponry in order to be successful as a hero. I contacted my doctor and he has agreed to create something that will help her become a stronger hero while taking into account its compatibility with her preferred fighting style and her overall build. Her weapon should be finished in a few days and I will begin sparring with her to increase her speed and accuracy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Saitama nods as he flips the pages of his manga, not bothering to look up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition to creating a weapon, I have requested a tracker as well. As her senpai, it is my duty to protect her and know her location at all times. I have determined that the best way for me to do this is by tracking her. Though cellphones would work, a cellphone can be easily lost or damaged so I made a request for something that would not be easy to dispose of. I considered a necklace or a bracelet or ring, but those would be simple to remove and could even fall off on their own when she is fighting. I believe the best tracker would be an earring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d Again, the bald hero seems less than interested.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. The design that I settled on is a stud, similar to my own piercings in shape, color, and size. If Delivery-chan\u2019s ears are not already pierced, I can perform the piercing myself during her next visit and I will place the tracker at that time. Then I will be able to monitor Delivery-chan no matter where she is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before you can argue from the kitchen, Saitama thankfully steps in. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would need to say this, but don\u2019t track Delivery-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster, this is the most efficient way to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s weird. Like, super weird.\u201d Saitama actually sets aside his manga to focus on his student now. \u201cGenos, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re excited about teaching her, but you have to reign it in a little, okay? You\u2019re going to creep her out if you put a tracker on her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe would not need to know the purpose of the earring. I intended to present it to her as a gift,\u201d Genos tried to argue.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you serious? That makes it even weirder.\u201d</p>\n<p>For being the way he is, Saitama seems to have a way better grasp on how relationships work. You listen in as he tries to explain to Genos <em>why</em> it\u2019s weird to put a tracker on someone and the cyborg just doesn\u2019t seem to get it. It makes you wonder how exactly Genos\u2019 adolescence went. He\u2019s smart when it comes to some topics, but he seems a bit\u2026<em>inept</em>\u2026when it comes to normal interaction.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re relieved when you\u2019re finally able to leave Saitama\u2019s apartment, but you can\u2019t relax yet. It\u2019s already starting to get dark because you\u2019ve spent an entire day with the two heroes. You remember the encounter with Sonic this morning and it puts you on edge as you begin riding your bike down the desolate streets of the ghost town. Listening for movement or anything else that might indicate danger.</p>\n<p>Honestly, you just want to go home and get some sleep. You didn\u2019t even sleep well last night and you had to wake up so early for your \u201ctraining\u201d. It doesn\u2019t feel like you did much hero stuff at all, but Genos seemed satisfied when you left.</p>\n<p>Thoughts of his talk with Saitama start to bounce around your head as you reach your apartment and unlock the door. He wants to give you a tracker and he wants to give you some weapons. Whatever weapons he has in mind, they\u2019re probably better than the kitchen knife you\u2019ve been carrying for protection. You just really don\u2019t like the idea of being tracked.</p>\n<p>Does it make sense? Given the fact that you\u2019ve been abducted in the past, it does make sense to track you. If you get snatched up by Sonic, Genos can track you down and rescue you. That doesn\u2019t mean you necessarily <em>like</em> the idea, though.</p>\n<p>Your friend and her boyfriend aren\u2019t home, thankfully. Honestly, you wouldn\u2019t want to have to explain things to them if they were. You trudge to your room and strip off your gear before collapsing onto your bed. Each passing second, you find yourself having more and more trouble staying awake.</p>\n<p>Sleep eventually drags you down and you don\u2019t wake up again until you hear your friend talking beyond your bedroom door. It sounds like she\u2019s been drinking with her boyfriend. They\u2019re laughing and joking about something that probably happened earlier. For a moment, you\u2019re envious of them and you open your eyes. You were going to just check the time, but now\u2026you\u2019re <em>staring</em>.</p>\n<p>Staring at the figure that\u2019s standing at the end of your bed. The slim figure wearing something dark and skin tight. The figure with the inhumanly wide smile drawing the corners of his lips back. There\u2019s something in that smile that reminds you of a predator about to pounce on prey. You blink and it\u2019s now much, much closer.</p>\n<p>Straddling your waist and gripping both of your wrists in one hand, Sonic grins down at you. \u201cI\u2019m surprised. I thought that Saitama\u2019s disciple would keep you busy all day and <em>all night</em>. That <em>is</em> why he\u2019s helping you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sonic brings his face closer to yours and his hips roll, grinding down against you. \u201cHe isn\u2019t here to get in the way this time. It\u2019s just the two of us. So\u2026what should I do with you first?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes he know about us?\u201d There\u2019s excitement in Sonic\u2019s voice as his lips brush the side of your ear. Warm breath skims over your neck and his chest pushes tight against yours. His left hand is holding both of your wrists above your head and all you can do is squirm as he laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t-!\u201d You\u2019re not able to finish your protest before he rolls his hips against yours, making sure that you can feel just how <em>excited</em> he is. As if he\u2019s been thinking about this ever since your encounter in the morning. Stiff and warm, pushing down on you from above.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder what he would think if he found out. How do you think your Hero Association would feel about their precious little hero sleeping with a criminal like me?\u201d Sonic quietly snickers and squeezes your wrists. \u201cDo you think they\u2019d fire you? Or maybe they would think you\u2019re a spy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that!\u201d There\u2019s blood rushing to your face as he nips at the side of your neck. \u201cI know what you think is going on, but-!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d He leans back, sitting on your hips and narrowing his cold gray eyes. His smile is still in place, unsettlingly wide, and he tilts his head. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m that na\u00efve? I know exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Your stomach twists in knots as he reached behind him and draws a short knife into view. The tip presses against the neckline of your t-shirt and tugs, starting a cut at the center of the neckline. \u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d You try to stay still, not wanting the blade to nick your skin.</p>\n<p>Sonic leans forward again and stray locks of dark hair fall around his face. There\u2019s something in the way he looks at you, the way he\u2019s smiling down at you, that sends a shiver along your spine. It\u2019s a blend of obsession and something like adoration. The blade continues to draw downwards, slicing through your t-shirt like it\u2019s made of tissue paper and moving down the center at a slow pace. The fabric gradually slides open until your shirt is sliced in half down the middle and your chest is exposed to the cold air.</p>\n<p>The way he stares down at your chest is so intent that you worry he might be planning to put the knife to your skin next. That fear only grows when his gray eyes briefly flick up to look into your eyes. \u201cDo you remember what I said when we slept together?\u201d</p>\n<p>A fresh wave of heat rushes to your face when you remembered it. That intimate moment in the shower when you were still being held hostage. He had said that he wouldn\u2019t let you go, that you were <em>his</em>. Goosebumps raise on your skin as you give him a small nod.</p>\n<p>Pleased, he poises the knife\u2019s tip against the top of your athletic bra and begins to slice into it. \u201cMaybe I should leave a reminder,\u201d he comments, teasingly brushing the edge of the blade between your breasts. Using just enough pressure to make you shiver and subconsciously hold your breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow would your <em>senpai</em> react if he saw my marks on your skin? I could leave a few scars to match mine. Or I could make some markings somewhere more visible. If he saw my name carved into your hand or saw it scratched onto your neck, what would he think? Do you really think that a Class S hero would want to be caught teaching someone like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026I missed you.\u201d The confession is quiet and you arch your back a little. Staring up at him, tugging at your wrists to try to get free. \u201cI missed you,\u201d you repeat, blushing.</p>\n<p>You did, didn\u2019t you? Despite the fact that Sonic is more than a little crazy, you\u2019ve been thinking about him a lot. You have this new life, this new job as a hero, but you still miss the days you spent with him.</p>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t make him blush. It shouldn\u2019t catch him off-guard because <em>of course</em> you\u2019ve missed him. His breathing hitches when he hears your confession and he can feel himself getting harder. Now he\u2019s wondering if your new relationship with Saitama\u2019s disciple was simply an effort to make him jealous, to push him to take action.</p>\n<p>Beyond your bedroom door, you can both hear your roommate and her boyfriend talking. It sounds like they\u2019re planning to go out again, but they\u2019re taking their time. Your eyes shift from Sonic to the door and he takes that moment to finish slicing open your bra. The fabric falls to the sides and now he can see more of your skin.</p>\n<p>You tense up beneath him as footsteps approach and when there\u2019s a knock at the door, you jolt. \u201cY-yeah? What\u2019s up?\u201d Your voice sounds a little weak when you call out to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! We\u2019re going out for dinner. Do you want to go with us?\u201d There\u2019s a drunken jovial tone to your friend\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>You look up at Sonic, who\u2019s still straddling your hips. He grins and leans back a little, releasing your hands. The knife flips in his hand and poises, as if he might launch it at the door. \u201cNo! Um\u2026no, I ate earlier! Thanks, though!\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks so pleased, seconds before he leans down and covers your lips with his. The knife disappears behind his back again and he moves without breaking the kiss. Adjusting his position so his legs are outstretched and one knee is settled firmly between your thighs to keep them open. The hand that was holding the knife caresses your chest before slowly gliding downwards, over your abdomen, and easing beneath the edge of your panties.</p>\n<p>Your roommate and her boyfriend are still in the apartment when Sonic\u2019s fingers rub against your lower lips. A moan is muffled by his mouth as he slips a finger into your warmth. There\u2019s enough slickness to let him push deeper with ease and he quickly begins to stroke your inner walls.</p>\n<p>Lifting your hips, you buck into his touch and feel a hot tightness forming in your core. He pumps his finger in and out a few times before adding another, stretching your walls further. Your slick arousal makes it so easy for him and he angles his hand so the heel of his palm rubs against your clit.</p>\n<p>Sonic\u2019s tongue rubs against your bottom lip, easing your mouth open. He grinds against your thigh, his stiff cock twitching in anticipation. When he adds a third finger and curls all three of them inside of you, he can feel you arching your back beneath him.</p>\n<p>Just to tease you even more, he finally breaks the kiss and buries his face in the side of your neck. \u201cThey\u2019re still here,\u201d he teases. \u201cYou need to be quiet. You don\u2019t want them to know what you\u2019re doing, do you? Can you imagine how-?\u201d</p>\n<p>A soft moan escapes you as he grinds his palm harder against your clit. \u201cS-Sonic, please\u2026just wait for them to leave!\u201d You beg in a whisper, desperately gripping his shoulders and digging your nails into him through his skintight suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwww! How can you be a hero if you can\u2019t even stay quiet?\u201d He grins against the side of your neck and increases the pace of his fingers. Thrusting them faster into your now soaked opening and nipping at your sensitive skin.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for his patience to wear thin. As fun as it is to tease you, he can only get so much pleasure from grinding on your thigh. Your roommate and her boyfriend are still out there, still arguing about where to go for dinner, when Sonic strips off his skintight suit and armor. You can clearly hear them debating about whether ramen or beef bowls would be better while his fingers dig beneath the waist of your panties and drag them down your legs.</p>\n<p>By the time your roommate and her boyfriend finally settle on going to a yakiniku place, Sonic is wrapping your legs around his hips and pushing inside of you. Lifting a hand, you cover your mouth as he sharply thrusts forward, burying his length in your warm cunt. The sound of the apartment door opening and closing can be heard. The tension finally snaps and you wrap your arms around Sonic, digging your nails into his bare skin and letting yourself moan.</p>\n<p>He only got a taste of this once before, but it\u2019s been on his mind. The warm, soft clenching around him makes him groan beside your ear and he can\u2019t stop himself from moving. Thrusting in at a gentle pace to start off, rolling his hips into yours and stroking your walls with his member. The way your lower lips kiss against the base of him makes him grunt and bite at his lip.</p>\n<p>Despite struggling to keep quiet himself, he snickers and teases you. \u201cThey\u2019re gone now. You can be as loud as you want. Come on. Let it out. Show me how much you <em>missed</em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>His pace increases steadily and your body is being jostled underneath him, your back rubbing against the sheets and your breasts rubbing against his chest. His hands are gripping your hips tightly, fingertips digging into your skin and likely to leave marks later. You arch your back a little, moving your hips to meet his thrusts.</p>\n<p>The stimulation quickly makes you unravel and clench around him, dragging your nails down his back. He hisses and his thrusts become more erratic. Faster than you would think possible. When he suddenly goes still, buried in your tight heat, he grunts and twitches inside of you. It feels so much warmer, so much wetter, between your thighs and your eyes widen at the realization that he finished inside instead of pulling out like before.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re panting as you hug him. With his chest pressed against yours, you can feel the rapid beating of his heart. For a moment, you just bask in the softness of your reunion. He\u2019s nuzzling his face into the side of your neck, sliding his arms beneath you to keep you close.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of things that you want to say to him. You want to finally correct him regarding his insane assumptions about your hero status and your relationship with Genos. You want to ask him why on earth he didn\u2019t pull out or at least use some kind of protection. You don\u2019t get the chance to ask anything.</p>\n<p>The sound of your phone ringing draws your attention to where your hoodie is sitting on the floor with your gear. There\u2019s a tightness in your stomach when you hear it ring over and over\u2026until it finally stops. Sonic leans back to give you a curious look and your phone immediately begins to ring again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026I should probably get that.\u201d You pull yourself towards the edge of the bed. He seems to pout, but he pulls out and lets you go. You glance at the door to make sure it\u2019s still locked and retrieve your phone from your pocket.</p>\n<p>Your anxiety spikes as you see the name on the screen. Your pulse accelerates and you hesitantly answer the call. \u201cY/N speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Without hesitating, without even asking if you\u2019re busy at the moment, Genos launches into a list of demands. \u201cDelivery-chan, I have ordered dinner from the restaurant that is closest to the edge of the ghost town. I have requested that the food be ready in an hour. Before you pick it up, I need for you to pick up a few things at the supermarket as well as something from the bakery. The bakery should still have a few items in stock so I will send you a list via text message and you will need to inquire if they still have them. If they are out, I will send you a list of other bakeries in City Z, but if you are unable to get them before dinner is ready, you can abandon that task. Are you listening?\u201d</p>\n<p>You\u2019re staring down at the floor, feeling the slick mess from Sonic running down your thigh. \u201cY-yeah. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. When the time approaches that you should be arriving, I will make sure that the streets are clear for you so you should not encounter any monsters.\u201d</p>\n<p>The kindness is unexpected. After Genos seemed to be actively trying to get you fired, it\u2019s surprising that he would do something like this. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not want the food to be cold when it arrives,\u201d he replies bluntly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026right.\u201d Your shoulders droop a little when you hear that, but you\u2019re not overly surprised. \u201cI\u2019ll leave soon. I just\u2026I need to get dressed.\u201d You glance over at Sonic, expecting to see him either glaring at you for agreeing to go or looking at you with amusement. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he tried to stop you, but no.</p>\n<p>It seems that as soon as you got off the bed, he dozed off. Sonic is lying on his side on your bed, his dark hair falling across his face. Totally unbothered by the fact that he\u2019s still naked. You hold the phone between your ear and shoulder as you pull your blanket over him to keep him warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more thing. When you pick up my order, there should be three meals included in the takeout bags. Be sure that they are all there. As your senpai, it is my responsibility to make sure that you are getting proper nutrition, so I took the liberty of ordering dinner for you as well. I expect you to eat all of it when you arrive.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s cold when you step outside. The air so chilled that you can see your breath when you exhale. Before you go to where your bike is chained, you glance up at the roof and half-expect to see Sonic there. He was gone when you woke up this morning and you\u2019re never sure where he goes when he disappears like that.</p>\n<p>For the past four days, ever since you reconnected, he keeps letting himself into your room through your window. Sometimes coming in with blood on him, sometimes looking scuffed as if he\u2019s been in a fight. He doesn\u2019t say anything about your roommates, but Sonic can spend hours talking about the bald hero and his \u201cdisciple\u201d. In a way\u2026he sort of reminds you of a stray black cat; wandering away and then coming back as he pleases, demanding your affection and your attention.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve actually lost a bit of sleep thanks to Sonic. He has this habit of wanting to stay close, wanting to touch you every chance he gets. As if to make up for the days you weren\u2019t together. And of course, he\u2019s still stuck on the idea that you\u2019ve been a hero for longer than you have been and that Genos has ulterior motives for helping you.</p>\n<p>Of course, he <em>does</em>. As you begin pedaling off down the street, you remember all of the errands that Genos has sent you on since your partnership started. He doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re in the middle of something or if you just finished training or if it\u2019s midnight.</p>\n<p>The sun is just starting to rise and the streets are pretty dead. No pedestrians and very few cars. You like it better that way anyway. It gives you the chance to let your mind wander a bit. It gives you time to daydream about what it\u2019ll be like once you have enough money saved for your own apartment, once you reach a high enough rank in the Hero Association that you won\u2019t have to worry about Genos being so intense with your training.</p>\n<p>He's a cyborg, right? Why is he Saitama\u2019s student? That\u2019s puzzling you as you continue down the road, passing a few stray cats on the sidewalk. If Genos is a cyborg, then doesn\u2019t that mean that getting stronger would just mean getting upgrades? His body is metal, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re not really sure how much of him is human.</p>\n<p>Your phone chimes with a message and you wait until you reach the first traffic light to check it. Immediately, your shoulders slouch. Of course\u2026Genos wants you to grab something from the bakery on your way to the ghost town. Only the <em>freshest</em> bread for <em>his</em> sensei.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a prickly, tingly sensation along your spine as you press onward. A quick glance over your shoulder doesn\u2019t show anything suspicious. The road is still empty, with the exception of a stray black cat that\u2019s decided to follow you. Damn.</p>\n<p>Stopping your bike, you wait for the little fluffball to catch up to you and you scoop it up to put in the bike basket. It is pretty cute\u2026and it looks pretty young. It doesn\u2019t even fight you when you pick it up and it seems content to ride in the basket. Honestly, you couldn\u2019t just leave them in the street! Right?!</p>\n<p>The rest of the ride to the bakery doesn\u2019t bring any trouble. The cat settles into the bike basket and seems to actually enjoy the ride. The only problem comes when you approach the bakery itself and see another bike parked in front. You pause, a few yards away from the shop, and stare at the bike for a moment.</p>\n<p>The cat looks up at you curiously and meows, like it\u2019s demanding to know why you stopped. Reaching forward, you gently pet its back and the feeling of the fluffy black fur is almost soothing. Almost. Just until the bakery door opens and he comes out.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got his arms full of bags and he stops halfway to his bike when he notices you. A shiver runs down your spine and you blush with embarrassment when he smiles and calls a greeting. \u201cIt\u2019s you! I was wondering if we\u2019d cross paths again. Oh! Did you in an accident? Your gear looks kind of scuffed.\u201d</p>\n<p>It's with reluctance that you dismount the bike and wheel it over to the front of the bakery. Chewing on the inside of your cheek, hoping that nobody sees you. It\u2019s bad enough that Sonic keeps jumping to conclusions; you don\u2019t need any civilians starting rumors. \u201cHey\u2026yeah, I got a little banged up,\u201d you greet him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s not good! What happened?\u201d Without even asking first, Mumen Rider shuffles his bags to one arm and reaches over to pet the cat in your basket.</p>\n<p>You watch this happen. Watch the cat nuzzle against his hand and hear it purr. Watch his smile grow as he quickly forgets what he just asked. \u201cI was\u2026caught up in a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA fight?!\u201d That pulls him out of his cat-induced trance and his head snaps in your direction again. \u201cAre you alright? How did you get into a fight? Are you-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201d He sure asks a lot of questions. To make it worse\u2026it seems like he\u2019s genuinely worried about you. You want to be upset, want to put distance between yourself and Mumen Rider so that people don\u2019t think you\u2019re a team or something. At the same time\u2026it\u2019s almost refreshing, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>Genos tends to your wounds when you get banged up during training, but it seems more like he\u2019s just fulfilling a self-imposed duty. Sonic took care of your injuries after he attacked you during your first meeting, but he\u2019s\u2026insane. It\u2019s difficult to be sure if he was actually worried about your wounds because he takes such a taunting tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Um\u2026just a second!\u201d Mumen Rider settles his bags into his bike basket and pulls out his phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s your number? I have polish for my gear, to buff out the scuff marks after a fight. It makes it look good, but it leaves deposits in the material to patch it up, too. I\u2019ll send you a link if you want to order some!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s this feeling in the pit of your stomach. It\u2019s a blend of embarrassment, kinship, and gratitude. Honestly, it <em>is</em> pretty sweet that he wants to help you. Of course, you still glance around to make sure no one sees you giving your phone number to Mumen Rider. No, that would be too much, right?</p>\n<p>This man is too sweet. He even waits outside with the cat while you get what Genos wanted from the bakery. When you come out of the shop, he greets you again with a warm smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d he points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026\u201d Heat rises to your face and you look away. \u201cI guess, everyone calls me \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery-chan?\u201d His head tilts and then his mouth forms a perfect \u201co\u201d as realization hits him. \u201cDelivery Girl! The Class B hero that I heard about from Saitama. I\u2019m sorry; I should\u2019ve recognized you!\u201d</p>\n<p>It was at this point that you really wanted to sink into the ground and disappear. Why was Saitama talking about you to other people? Why did Mumen Rider have to call you that? Is that really the name that the Hero Association has assigned you? Why the hell did Genos tell them that your name was Delivery-chan when he submitted that recommendation?!</p>\n<p>With a nervous laugh, you settle the bag of bread into your basket. \u201cYeah\u2026that\u2019s me\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>While you were trying to push past the feeling of being utterly mortified, Sonic was regretfully working. A simple job for him and it should pay well. Just something to tide him over for a while so he can focus on other things for a bit. Besides, he\u2019s going to need money for what he has planned.</p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t it time for him to upgrade his hideout? Someplace bigger, someplace nicer with an even better location. He\u2019s been thinking about it since you were \u201crescued\u201d from him by Saitama and staying at your apartment has only further convinced him that this would be for the best.</p>\n<p>Your roommate and her boyfriend are annoying. Your friend always wants you to go to dinner with them, go shopping with her, come out of your room and hang out in the main room with her. She\u2019s even worse when it comes to her boyfriend. Just how often do they bicker about where to eat dinner?!</p>\n<p>Worse than the restaurant arguments are when Sonic can hear them in their shared bedroom, through the wall. The bed creaking, the dramatic noises they both make like they\u2019re in a competition with each other. He\u2019s not sure how you\u2019ve managed to live with them for so long.</p>\n<p>Sonic doesn\u2019t even have to think about it when he\u2019s fighting his targets today. Slow, dimwitted bodyguards that fumble with their weapons like they\u2019ve never handled them before today. A little bit of blood splatters his cheek as he thinks about what kind of apartment you might like.</p>\n<p>Something close to the shopping area, right? Or maybe somewhere farther away from the more populated areas. He wants it to have plenty of space for sparring. If you really want to get stronger, he should be the one to train you instead of Saitama\u2019s disciple. How can someone like him even teach you?</p>\n<p>There are bodies all over the floor as he leans on one hip and considers it. Definitely not a ground-level apartment and probably not a first-level one. A top floor unit might be good because then he can come and go easier using the roof. Somewhere with plenty of natural light would be ideal.</p>\n<p>Sonic half-turns as he hears approaching footsteps and he can feel the corners of his lips drawing back. That bad habit of his\u2026stretching his mouth into an unprofessionally wide smile. \u201cWhat do you think is better?\u201d he starts, as the next wave of incompetent bodyguards rushes into the room. \u201cAn apartment near a shopping district or an apartment that\u2019s secluded?\u201d</p>\n<p>Saitama\u2019s apartment is in such a <em>secluded</em> area. The thought has passed your mind before, but here it is again. You pass by abandoned shops and apartments, riding over cracked pavement and closely listening for any approaching monsters.</p>\n<p>Talking to Mumen Rider lasted longer than you expected. If Genos wasn\u2019t going to lecture you about punctuality as soon as you get to Saitama\u2019s, you might have talked to him a bit longer. Honestly, Mumen Rider is really sweet. He was polite and friendly, wanting to know about your bike and your gear. The whole time, he kept petting the stray cat in your basket and occasionally commenting on how cute it was.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s right\u2026the cat. A glance down shows that the stray black cat is still in your basket, enjoying the ride. That means you really need to avoid monsters today. Even though you\u2019ve only had this little fluffball for around an hour, you\u2019ve formed an attachment to them. You don\u2019t want to risk them getting hurt if a monster attacks you.</p>\n<p>Rising off your seat, you pedal faster and navigate to Saitama\u2019s apartment. The cat is all too eager to join you and trots alongside you when you go up to his floor with the bag from the bakery. Just as expected, Genos is the one to greet you and he immediately puts a hand on his hip in that sassy way you\u2019ve grown so accustomed to.</p>\n<p>His mouth opens, but he pauses and lowers his head as the cat catches his attention. \u201cWhy did you bring a cat with you? If you are going to take your training seriously, then you cannot bring distractions. Is this why you were late today? I texted you at five-thirty this morning and I specifically told you to be here by six and it is now seven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p>\n<p>Behind him, there\u2019s a loud yawn as Saitama comes into view. \u201cOh. Hey, Delivery-chan. You\u2019re here pretty early, huh? I thought you didn\u2019t train until later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile it is true that we return to the apartment later in the day, I have requested that Delivery-chan come to the ghost town for training shortly after sunrise. I have read multiple articles that can attest to the benefits of training in the early morning as opposed to training later in the day. Additionally, this provides us with more time to run errands in the afternoon and ensure that we will not miss one of the flash sales at the supermarket.\u201d</p>\n<p>You slip past them both with the bag from the bakery and move to the main room, hearing their conversation continue as they follow. The little cat is still beside you, still pleasantly trotting along like it\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s as you get to the other room that you pause in your steps and have to just stare.</p>\n<p>Sitting on the table is a box wrapped rather professionally in wrapping paper with a bow perched on top. It\u2019s a medium sized box and you can see the tag on it that simple reads \u201cDelivery-chan\u201d. Normally, a gift would make you feel excited. The sight of <em>this</em> one fills you with a sense of unease as you remember Genos talking about getting weapons for you\u2026and something to let him track you.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d You\u2019re hesitant to open it, after what you overheard Genos and Saitama talking about before. The mention of a tracking device, in the form of an earring to match the ones Genos wears. A glance over your shoulder shows him looking through the bag from the bakery to make sure that everything\u2019s there, as if he doesn\u2019t trust that you got everything on the list.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Oh, that? It\u2019s a present, right?\u201d Saitama stops in the doorway and looks from you to Genos, tilting his head slightly. \u201cDid you want Delivery-chan to open it now or wait until she gets home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe needs to open it now. I need to make sure that no alterations are needed. I will prepare breakfast and then I would like for her to open the box.\u201d The cyborg briefly pauses on his way to the kitchen, looking down at you. \u201cDelivery-chan, this gift will help to improve your ability to fight monsters. I am looking forward to seeing your reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p>That last part makes your eyebrows raise a bit. Is he really excited about this gift? He has such a monotone voice so it\u2019s kind of hard to read him sometimes, but he seems genuinely eager to see you open the box.</p>\n<p>Turning your attention back to the gift box on the table, you can feel the fluffy black kitten crawl into your lap. Without even thinking about it, you start petting it and watch Saitama from the corner of your eye as he sits across the table from you. You\u2019re still not sure what you\u2019re going to do with the cat.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re cute. Super cute. Especially when they start purring and curl up, looking at you with those wide eyes. It\u2019s hard to believe this is one of those stray cats that you see almost every morning. How can you even think about just leaving them out on the street at the end of the day?</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s their name?\u201d The question comes from across the table, where Saitama is leaning forward to try to look at the kitten.</p>\n<p>A name? You\u2019re still trying to figure out what to do with them. The apartment doesn\u2019t allow pets so if you want to bring them home with you, you\u2019ll have to sneak them in. Shrugging, you look back at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. This is one of stray cats from my neighborhood so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you get to name them,\u201d he finishes for you. \u201cI think you should name them something cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething cool?\u201d Lowering your eyes to the kitten again, you can hear Genos approaching the table. You\u2019re a little surprised when he sets a plate down in front of you, but you\u2019re not going to turn down the free breakfast. \u201cThank you, Genos-senpai,\u201d you mumble. There\u2019s a rush of blood to your face when you call him \u201csenpai\u201d, but you know he\u2019ll throw a fit if you don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you do plan to keep it, you need to give it a name. I agree with my sensei. You should give the cat a cool name. I believe the name \u201cPower\u201d would be a good choice. Not only is it an uncommon name for cats, but it will also encourage the cat to grow strong enough to surpass the other cats in your neighborhood and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>As Genos continues his speech, you zone out a bit and eat breakfast. Stuck on the fact that he\u2019s talking about the kitten as if they\u2019re a shounen manga protagonist. He\u2019s still going on, seemingly fixated on the name \u201cPower\u201d, when you finish eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I open the box now?\u201d You see his head snap in your direction and instantly tense up. His gold and black eyes narrow, clearly upset that you interrupted his rant. \u201cSenpai?\u201d</p>\n<p>His expression loses its faint irritation and Genos nods, pushing the box closer to you on the table. \u201cYes. Please open the gift now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d It\u2019s with a bit of hesitation that you begin tearing away the wrapping paper and bow. Pausing to glance at Genos, you slip your fingertips beneath the edge of the lid. He\u2019s watching so intensely. Leaning forward, his mouth set into a slight frown and eyes focused on your face. It almost seems like he might lunge at you.</p>\n<p>When you lift the lid, your eyes widen. Immediately, you\u2019re able to see a pair of sheathed blades and a smaller box tucked between them. The sheathes are a sturdy black fabric with metallic gold filigree. You can see that the handles of the blades are wrapped in black material with gold accents. What really catches your eyes is the shiny golden protrusion at the end of the handle.</p>\n<p>Tilting your head, you reach in to draw one of the blades out. It reminds you of Sonic\u2019s katana, but definitely flashier. The coloration actually reminds you of\u2026your cyborg senpai\u2019s eyes. You glance over and find those gold and black eyes still fixated on you, waiting for you to say something.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are amazing, Genos-senpai. Thank you!\u201d You smile, your fingers wrapping around the handle and rubbing your thumb over the cord wrapping.</p>\n<p>Genos takes the other blade and holds it up a little, tilting the blade so the odd protrusion is facing you. \u201cI reviewed my footage of your monster fights and I determined the best weapon for you. The weapon that you carried before your abduction was a stun gun and I saw that you utilized it frequently when you fought monsters in the ghost town. The new weapon that you were issued by Happy Delivery Company was a chef\u2019s knife. I determined that a combination of a blade and the electrical power of a stun gun would be ideal.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sets the katana down and watches you draw the blade partially out of its sheath. \u201cThese were specially designed by Doctor Kuseno. I requested a blade that would be optimal for you. They are lightweight so they will be easy to carry with you, even if you are on your bike. However, these blades are also strong enough that they can cut through metal. They can be electrically charged by a mechanism built into the handle. In order to charge them, you will need to hold down the button on the end of the handle for up to five seconds. At this time, they will take around thirty seconds to fully charge and at that time, you will need to refrain from making contact with the blade itself and only touch the handle.\u201d</p>\n<p>You almost drop the sword when you hear him say that. \u201cS-seriously?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. If you are going to reach Class S, you need to be properly equipped. These will improve your ability to fight monsters.\u201d He\u2019s still staring at you expectantly.</p>\n<p>The intensity of his stare is pretty unnerving, but you can\u2019t deny your excitement. These new weapons feel so nice in your hands. Biting at the inside of your cheek, you glance down at the kitten and then at Genos again. \u201cCan I\u2026practice with them <em>today</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile that settles on his face is so unfamiliar. You\u2019re used to him frowning in disapproval or setting his lips into a straight line as he watches you struggle to keep up during sparring. This is the first time you\u2019ve seen Genos look so pleased and, for just a second, he almost looks cute. \u201cYes! I will gladly take you somewhere populated with monsters so that you can become used to your new weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but\u2026what about the cat?\u201d Saitama finally speaks up for the first time since you opened your gift. There are toast crumbs around his mouth and on his shirt, but he doesn\u2019t seem to realize it. No, his attention is focused on the little black cat sleeping in your lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026do you want to hold them?\u201d You very carefully lift the kitten and hand them over. Immediately, they curl up in Saitama\u2019s lap to keep sleeping. The bald hero\u2019s face is as deadpan as always, but he doesn\u2019t complain.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. I can watch them while you guys train.\u201d The faintest smile appears on his face as he looks down at the kitten. \u201cMaybe I can think of a name for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>When you secure the sheathes to your belt, you have to admit that these electric swords really are nice. True to his word, they\u2019re lightweight and the design is strangely elegant. Walking with them hanging at your waist doesn\u2019t feel awkward. Even going down the stairs, they aren\u2019t cumbersome.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the idea of having proper weapons like this makes you feel safer. These are so much better than the chef knife you were given by your boss at the delivery company. The air outside is still cool since it\u2019s so early in the day and the sun is starting to lift higher in the sky. For the first time since you began training with Genos, you\u2019re actually looking forward to getting started.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore we begin, I have a question. Delivery-chan, are your ears pierced?\u201d The cyborg meets your curious gaze with a stern one.</p>\n<p>Again, you\u2019re reminded of his conversation with Saitama. You can see that he\u2019s holding the smaller box that had been in the gift box. If you say \u201cno\u201d, he\u2019s going to insist on piercing your ears. If you say \u201cyes\u201d, he\u2019s going to insist on putting the earrings on for you. So you just tell him whether your ears are pierced or not.</p>\n<p>He nods and looks again at the box in his hand. Without another word, he lifts the lid. You tense, expecting to see a pair of earrings that match his\u2026a pair of earrings that contain a tracking device in at least one of them. Instead, you see a bracelet. It\u2019s a chunky, gray metal bracelet with what looks like a dark stone set in the metal.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery-chan, give me your wrist.\u201d Genos stares at you expectantly and when you hesitate, he decides to just bluntly tell you what this is. \u201cThere is a tracking device in this bracelet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want you to track me,\u201d you argue. You try to step back, but Genos grabs your arm and secures the bracelet around your wrist. Despite being such a chunky bracelet, it\u2019s tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe purpose of the tracking device is to prevent a repeat of what happened when you were abducted by that pervert. If you disappear again, then I will be able to locate and rescue you. As your senpai, it is my duty to keep you safe.\u201d Taking a step closer to you, his expression becomes even more intense. \u201cI will not rely on my sensei to save you again. I will be the only one that saves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Find a monster and defeat it. The instructions that Genos gave you are simple enough and he told you that this area has monsters that are wolf or tiger level. Honestly, it sounds like grinding in an RPG for experience points. When you think of it that way, though, it does feel less like a chore and more like a game.</p>\n<p>Coasting down the cracked pavement on your bike, you glance at the bracelet around your wrist. The dark stone set in the side of it catches the sunlight, casting a glint off of the smooth surface. You know that the tracking chip is hidden underneath it, embedded in the metal bracelet.</p>\n<p>If you stray too far from the area, Genos will track you down. That\u2019s what he warned you before he left. Though it didn\u2019t sound like a threat. No, it sounded more like a reassurance. Of course, that <em>does</em> imply that a monster would\u2019ve grabbed you and dragged you away.</p>\n<p>Pausing at an intersection, you listen for sounds of movement. There\u2019s no wind so you can hear every shuffle of footsteps, every murmur of the monsters within the ghost town as they wander around. You don\u2019t necessarily want to pick a fight with one so you hesitate to move in their direction.</p>\n<p>Every time you\u2019ve fought a monster in the past, they attacked you first. You were just trying to complete a delivery to Saitama\u2019s apartment and they chased after you. The idea of approaching a monster and challenging them to a fight just\u2026doesn\u2019t feel right.</p>\n<p>Is this what other lower class heroes do? Class C heroes have to do something every week so do they run around looking for monsters to fight? Leaning forward with your elbows resting on the handlebars, you chew at the inside of your cheek. You really are lucky, huh? To have the Demon Cyborg vouch for you and get you a nice rank in Class B.</p>\n<p>Can you really beat a monster, though? Those other fights\u2026you always just incapacitated the monsters so you could slip away. What exactly does \u201cdefeating\u201d them entail? Genos doesn\u2019t want you to actually <em>kill</em> a monster, does he?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I\u2019m surprised that he let you wander around the ghost town alone.\u201d There\u2019s a teasing lilt to the voice beside your ear, a shiver running down your spine when you feel cold metal press against the side of your neck.</p>\n<p>Sonic can\u2019t help but grin when he feels you tensing up. Like a cat toying with a mouse, he feels a rush of satisfaction at the way your body freezes in place. He\u2019s perched behind you, balancing on the luggage rack that\u2019s on the back of your bike. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t have anything to say?\u201d he taunts, leaning closer so his chest is against your back.</p>\n<p>You wince, feeling the edge of the blade shallowly nick your skin. Adrenaline is pumping through your veins and your eyes shift to the side. You can just make out his profile at the corner of your right eye, where he\u2019s leaning forward over your shoulder. \u201cSonic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? What are you doing so far away from your \u201csenpai\u201d?\u201d He draws the blade away from your neck and gracefully hops down from the luggage rack. As he tucks away his weapon, his eyes settle on yours. The twin katanas hanging on your belt and the gaudy bracelet around your wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m doing independent training,\u201d you explain, quickly looking away. You push your sleeve down more, trying to cover the bracelet. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to find a monster and defeat it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did <em>those</em> come from?\u201d His cold gray eyes flick from the blades up to your face, but when he sees you looking away from him, his grin falls.</p>\n<p>Very, very quietly, you mutter, \u201cTh-they were a gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA gift?\u201d Crossing his arms, he leans on one hip and raises an eyebrow. \u201cA gift from who? A gift from Saitama? Or was it his disciple?\u201d</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to tell him. If he knows that these were a gift from Genos, you\u2019re never going to hear the end of it. Worse, he might try to fight Genos and Saitama will have to break it up again. Wishing that you hadn\u2019t said anything at all, you frown and turn your head to look at him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to get back to training.\u201d Gripping the handlebars, you begin pedaling off down the road, but you know he\u2019s going to follow you. With his speed, Sonic can effortlessly keep up with your bike and you know how persistent he can be. You also know that once he\u2019s decided something, he sticks to it no matter what you say.</p>\n<p>You need to come up with something, but what would sound believable? \u201c<em>I</em> bought them,\u201d you blurt out the second the thought pops into your head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bought them?\u201d Sonic questions, moving alongside your bike.</p>\n<p>\u201cI bought them with some of the money I made\u2026because I needed new weapons. They\u2019re a gift from me to me.\u201d All you can do is hope that he believes the lie. It sounds believable, right? Heroes buy new gear and new weapons so they can perform better when they\u2019re fighting monsters. So it just makes sense that you\u2019d want to arm yourself.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say anything to that. Instead, Sonic lets himself fall behind and follows you at a distance. While he <em>is</em> curious about how well you can really handle those blades, he\u2019s also thinking about the blades in general. Katanas with the grip wrapped in black and gold fabric. Along with that gaudy metal bracelet on your wrist\u2026it feels like you\u2019re trying to impress someone.</p>\n<p>Black and gold. Where has he seen that before? The corner of his mouth twitches and the ninja quickens his pace to speed ahead of you now. Black and gold, black and gold\u2026Sonic knows that the colors remind him of something.</p>\n<p>Leaping onto a streetlight, he waits for you to catch up to him as he thinks about it more. It\u2019s right at the edge of his thoughts. As you appear around a corner, pedaling fast and looking back over your shoulder, he can almost think of whatever it is.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get to focus on it for much longer because all of his attention shifts to you. There\u2019s a monster lumbering along behind you, shouting at you in a low and distorted voice. Thick arms are outstretched, hooked fingertips swiping at you as the monster\u2019s fish-like mouth flaps open and closed. It\u2019s been a while since he saw you fight a monster so maybe he\u2019ll just let this play out and watch.</p>\n<p>You need to get off your bike. You <em>know</em> that you need to get off your bike, but the problem is that you\u2019re being chased by this monster! How does Mumen Rider fight monsters when he\u2019s almost always on his bike?!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s risky, but you lift a leg and launch yourself off the bike, managing to land crouched on the sidewalk and gripping the handles of your swords. The monster is still running at you, its broad feet making a wet slap against the sidewalk with each heavy footstep. As it draws closer and closer, you brace yourself to fight it off.</p>\n<p>You got some practice in with Genos before he sent you off on your own so you at least have a <em>little</em> experience. He taught you how to charge them up and had you practice unsheathing them over and over until he was satisfied that you were competent enough with the blades. When the monster is almost on you, you draw both arms back and then thrust forward sharply.</p>\n<p>The gurgling sound it makes sends a chill down your spine. The fishlike monster flails its arms and stumbles backwards, hooked fingertips grazing your cheek and opening three cuts. Pulling your arms back, the swords easily slide out of its abdomen and you jump back to get some distance between you. Every muscle is tensed as you wait for its next move.</p>\n<p>The monster is bleeding from where your katana pierced its abdomen, but it doesn\u2019t seem to feel weakened by the blood loss. Instead, it almost seems energized. With a gurgling screech of a swear word, the monster lowers its head and barrels towards you. Before you can lift your swords to block it, the top of its skull slams into your midsection and sends you flying backwards down the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re grateful for the quality of your armor. Skidding over the pavement, you definitely feel it, but at least you won\u2019t have any scrapes later. A few bruises, maybe, but nothing that will sting. You turn onto your stomach and twist, pushing yourself up into a crouched position. Adjusting your grip, you press the switches on the pommels against the ground.</p>\n<p>One second, two seconds, three seconds, four seconds, five seconds. You dodge another headbutt and turn sharply as you feel the handles humming against your palms. Tightening your fingers around the black and gold wrapped handles, you know that you need to stall for thirty seconds while the blades charge. Thirty seconds should be easy enough, right?</p>\n<p>It's the longest thirty seconds of your life. Running and dodging, throwing in the occasional kick to try to defend yourself. You wince when you feel the sole of your boot slam against one of the punctures and then slickly slide to the side. Monster blood gushes from the wound, painting the bottom of your boot.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re finally done charging, they look magnificent. Electricity dances along the length of the metal with a nearly hypnotic hum, sparking and emitting a warm light. You back away from the monster as it huffs and drools, its dark eyes narrowed with hatred.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s blood running down your cheek, drizzling down the side of your neck from your wounds. You know that your ribs and back will be bruised later. As you face this monster, your only thought is to defeat it. So when it comes charging at you, you don\u2019t hesitate to thrust your blades deep into its chest. The combination of trauma and electricity sends it crumpling onto its side on the ground; twitching and snarling at the back of its throat.</p>\n<p>You wait there for a moment. Muscles tensed, eyes locked onto its body until it goes silent. Guilt makes your stomach clench, but you try to push that feeling aside. This is a monster! It attacked you! So why do you feel guilty about fighting it?</p>\n<p>Sonic tilts his head, watching you pull the blades out of the now unmoving monster. He isn\u2019t that impressed by your fighting style, but he <em>is</em> impressed by the blades. They look like they\u2019re good quality and they\u2019re specialty blades. Electrically charged so you can stun your target and do damage at the same time.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sure that you didn\u2019t buy those yourself. You would\u2019ve needed to contact someone to custom make them, but he\u2019s been shadowing you whenever you\u2019re not training with Saitama\u2019s disciple. Sonic knows that you didn\u2019t order those swords for yourself. So who bought them for you? Saitama or his annoying student?</p>\n<p>Again, Sonic looks at the black and gold handles of your katana. His eyes widen as realization hits him. His lips twist into a scowl and he leaps down from the streetlight, landing gracefully near you. \u201cI\u2019m actually a little impressed. Where did you buy those?\u201d</p>\n<p>You\u2019re trying to flick off the excess monster blood, but when you hear Sonic\u2019s question, you pause. \u201cHuh? Um\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious that you don\u2019t know where they were purchased from. Sonic reaches over and wraps his hand around the handle of a katana, his hand on top of yours. \u201cThe black and gold wrapping reminds me of something. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tightening your grip, you sheathe your other blade. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t know?\u201d Pulling sharply, he brings you stumbling closer to him and nearly makes you fall against him. There\u2019s amusement in his large gray eyes as he stares down at you, like a cat cornering a mouse. \u201cDon\u2019t think that I forgot about the bracelet. Do you really think that I wouldn\u2019t notice if you bought something like that for yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>His other hand lifts, gripping your chin so you can\u2019t turn away from him. \u201cI think that someone gave you those things. I think that someone chose black and gold on purpose. I wonder who that could be.\u201d Sonic taps a fingertip against your jaw, grinning. \u201cWell? Are you going to confess or should I do something to make you talk?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s monster blood drying on your clothes, your skin, your hair. The wounds on your cheek sting and the wind is making the pain worse. A glance over your shoulder shows a dark, blurry shape tracking you from the rooftops. Your only warning before his attack is a metallic glint and then an explosion sends your chest slamming against the handlebars of your bike.</p>\n<p>Pedaling faster, you know that he\u2019s just toying with you. If Sonic wanted to kill you, you\u2019d be dead already. He\u2019s like a cat cruelly playing with a mouse. Already costing you two extra monster kills because he knows where you got your swords and he doesn\u2019t want you to use the swords that Genos gave you.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re able to hear the thud of a body behind you in the street, alerting you to yet another roaming monster that he\u2019s taken out before you got the chance to. He isn\u2019t playing fair. Gritting your teeth, you finally pull over off to the side and dismount your bike.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s messing with your training. How are you going to get better at fighting monsters, how are you going to raise your rank, if Sonic keeps killing the monsters before you can fight them? Not to mention, if Genos finds out about this, he\u2019s going to insist on pushing you harder the next time you train with him. Waking you up earlier, making you train on an empty stomach, pushing you until you probably collapse.</p>\n<p>Sonic\u2019s grin only adds to your frustration and your hands settle on the handles of your blades. You don\u2019t hesitate to begin walking towards him, not about to back down because you\u2019ve become so angry. \u201cGo home,\u201d you hiss. Two simple words that should easily convey your feelings, but they just make his grin grow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re not used to competition? How do you handle it if another hero shows up to fight a monster?\u201d He leans on one hip, crossing his arms over his chest. Sonic\u2019s smug expression doesn\u2019t waver and his eyes lower to your swords.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust let me finish my training!\u201d You\u2019re exhausted, you\u2019re wounded. You\u2019ll be content to just go back to Saitama\u2019s apartment and tell Genos you\u2019re done for the day. Get the cat, go home, and just sleep. Doesn\u2019t that sound nice?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should I? I wonder what your precious senpai would think if you never made it back. How long would he search for you before he gives up?\u201d He\u2019d be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t having fun. Teasing you, watching you scurry to get away from his exploding shuriken. You\u2019re putting on that act again; pretending to be a low class hero, a <em>weakling</em>, while he knows the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cSonic.\u201d The tone of your voice softens and you\u2019re on the verge of tears at this point. \u201cJust wait for me at home. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes, but doesn\u2019t persist. Shifting his weight to his other hip, he nods. \u201cFine. Just don\u2019t make me wait for long.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the blink of an eye, he\u2019s gone. Leaving you behind in the ghost town, but not returning to your apartment yet. Sonic isn\u2019t stupid. He knows that you didn\u2019t buy those swords and that bracelet for yourself. He\u2019s observant; he would have noticed if you made a purchase like that.</p>\n<p>Those were a gift from Saitama\u2019s disciple, weren\u2019t they? And just what does he get out of giving you such fancy presents? What does he expect to get out of it? Did he intend to just make you indebted to him or does this run even deeper than that?</p>\n<p>Sonic doesn\u2019t like the growing distance between you. When he had you in his hideout, he had you all to himself. If Saitama hadn\u2019t \u201crescued\u201d you, then the two of you could be in his old hideout right now. With you making dinner while he sharpens his blades, with you cuddling up to him in the futon at night. No pesky roommates, no annoying heroes to get in the way.</p>\n<p>Why do you think so highly of heroes anyway? You have to follow rules set by people in suits who would never put their own lives at risk. Pursuing a career as a hero is pointless. Don\u2019t you realize that? There are so many heroes out there anyway; you\u2019ll never stand out the way you probably want to.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why you\u2019re training so much, isn\u2019t it? Because you want to raise your rank, you want to stand out. You want the money and recognition that comes with being one of those high class heroes. When he thinks about so many people watching your little \u201ccareer\u201d progress, it sends a spike of jealousy through his chest. Why should he have to share you with so many strangers?</p>\n<p>It's quick and easy for Sonic to form a plan. Get an apartment that you\u2019ll like, isolate you the way he did before. He\u2019s sure it will be easy to convince you to quit that job once he has you all to himself again. Maybe you can put your new blades to work at his side instead of using them to make the Hero Association look good.</p>\n<p>He passes Saitama\u2019s apartment building, not sparing his unit a glance. If he had, he would\u2019ve seen Saitama standing on his balcony with a small black cat perched on his shoulder. While he doesn\u2019t notice the bald hero, Saitama does notice him and tilts his head a little. \u201cI wonder where <em>he\u2019s</em> going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you say something, master?\u201d Genos calls to him from the kitchen, pausing in his current task of chopping vegetables for a hot pot.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough? I want more meat than vegetables.\u201d Saitama steps back into the apartment and looks over in time to see Genos checking something on his phone. \u201cGenos? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gold and black eyes briefly lift to look at the older hero before lowering to his phone screen again. \u201cI was just checking on Delivery-chan\u2019s location. She is dangerously close to crossing the boundary into an area with more monsters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally tucking his phone into his pocket, Genos leaves the kitchen. \u201cMaster. I will return soon. I am going to bring her back before she can attract the attention of a monster that is above a wolf threat level. She is not ready to fight a monster in the tiger threat level range.\u201d</p>\n<p>Saitama slips his hands into his pockets and leans against the wall, watching the blond cyborg put on his shoes. \u201cHey, Genos?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes? Is there anything that you need before I leave?\u201d He eagerly looks to his mentor, ready to leap at the chance to do something for him.</p>\n<p>The bald hero shakes his head. \u201cNo. I wanted to ask about Delivery-chan. I know you\u2019re excited to have a student of your own, but you know she\u2019s only human, right? You\u2019ve been pushing her pretty hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to push her if she is going to raise her rank and class. My plan is to help her raise to Class S so that she-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t train all of the time, though. You have to let her take breaks.\u201d Saitama lifts a hand to pet the kitten on his shoulder and frowns ever so slightly. \u201cIf you keep pushing her so hard, she might start to dislike you. She might even try to quit if she isn\u2019t enjoying herself. Training can be pretty fulfilling, but it\u2019s just as important to make sure she\u2019s working towards <em>her</em> goal, Genos.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cyborg stands upright and his gaze shifts from the closed apartment door to Saitama. \u201cMaster\u2026I understand. I will ask her about her goals-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot just that. Why don\u2019t you let her take the rest of the day to just hang out? You\u2019ve been running her pretty ragged. You have to boost her morale, you know? So spending time with her outside of training would be a good way to strengthen your bond and make her want to train with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see. Yes, that makes sense. Master, you always know what\u2019s best. I will bring her back and we will do something besides training.\u201d Starting towards the door, he pauses once his hand is on the handle. \u201cMaster?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm? What\u2019s up?\u201d Saitama approaches, shifting the kitten so it\u2019s cradled in his arms instead of perched on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I ask you something that might sound strange? As my teacher, you have a wish to protect me if I am in danger, correct? My desire to protect Delivery-chan feels like it grows stronger each time we train. I frequently consider what could happen to her on her way home in the evenings and on a few occasions, I have followed her home at a distance to ensure her safety. Even now, knowing that she is close to an area with higher level monsters, I feel worried. Is this normal? Is that how you feel about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Saitama\u2019s reply is blunt. \u201cThat just sounds like you have a crush on her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No. Master, I meant-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been having fun, now that you\u2019re helping someone train, but seriously. It\u2019s pretty obvious that you like Delivery-chan. You should probably hurry, if we\u2019re going to eat soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. It was a foolish question to ask. Thank you, master.\u201d Genos leaves the apartment with a stoic expression, but his thoughts are racing. Hopping from one encounter to the next, considering all of your past interactions and his growing urge to protect you. It\u2019s with the faintest smile that he finds himself seeing what Saitama meant.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re more than a little beaten up by the time you see Genos approaching. A bit bruised, kind of bloody. Limping alongside your bicycle with blood gushing from a wound on your thigh. You thought you were being careful, but that last monster came out of nowhere and almost had you wishing that Sonic was still around to help.</p>\n<p>Leaning against a building for support, you lift a hand to your wounded cheek and wince. The blood mixed with your sweat and it\u2019s stinging again. It almost hurts enough to make your eyes water.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery-chan. I warned you to stay away from this area.\u201d Genos approaches, coming down the sidewalk with a stern expression on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re wounded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I got a little lost.\u201d You can\u2019t tell him about Sonic\u2019s interference. You can\u2019t let him know about the interrogation. Instead, you limp towards the cyborg with hope blooming in your chest. \u201cI really need to rest\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I believe that resting would be best. You need to regain your strength and heal before we can continue with your training.\u201d He effortlessly lifts you in his arms and sets off, using the boosters in his shoulder blades to give him a speed boost.</p>\n<p>Your arms wrap around his neck on instinct to steady yourself and blood rises to your cheeks. The humiliation of having to be carried mixes with the knowledge of what\u2019s to come. The lecture, the insistence on a more rigorous training schedule once you\u2019re healed. You can already picture him standing before you with his hands on his hips as he tells you off for wandering away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It\u2019s a mumbled apology as you tighten your arms around his neck. The wind is whipping at your hair and you have to close your eyes to keep them from stinging. Your injuries are hurting worse than before and exhaustion has finally set in as consciousness begins to slip through your fingers.</p>\n<p>Genos can feel your body going limp in his arms, can detect that your heart rate is slowing to a resting pace. In seconds, you will be unconscious and it will be his responsibility to protect you from any potential danger. Feeling confident that you\u2019re just at the edge of consciousness, he speaks. \u201cI have begun to have feelings for you that Master Saitama says are abnormal for a student and teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p>You\u2019re barely awake when you hear him say that. It catches you off-guard, of course. With the way he\u2019s been pushing you, with the ridiculous demands he makes, you\u2019d think that he dislikes you. Before you can say anything, sleep finally takes hold and your mind goes blank.</p>\n<p>Genos makes a mental note of the injuries that he spotted on you when he arrived. The bloody gashes across your cheek, the deep slash across your upper thigh. You pushed yourself during your training and it shows. Like when you received your ranking, Genos feels pleased. He feels proud.</p>\n<p>Such a diligent, determined student. Just like how <em>he</em> is for Saitama. Both of you want to become stronger and having someone with the same goal feels nice. It feels like an extra push, like extra support. The cyborg knows that he should be patient and wait for you to wake up before he begins questioning you, but his questions feel like they\u2019re burning a hole through his chest.</p>\n<p>Once he reaches the apartment, he lies you on the floor near the table and grabs the first aid kit. He returns to find your little black cat curled up beside you on the floor. Genos kneels at your side and begins to clean the wounds on your face first, deciding to speak with you more once you wake up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Genos. I know you\u2019re excited, but staring at her isn\u2019t going to make her wake up faster.\u201d Every time Saitama looks up from his manga, he sees his student still sitting beside your unconscious form with his intense stare directed at you.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve barely moved since Genos finished patching you up. Didn\u2019t even stir awake when he had to strip off your armored hoodie and pants so he could tend to your other wounds and bruises. Genos already washed them, of course, and now they\u2019re hanging out to dry.</p>\n<p>The cyborg maintains his stare, completely unfazed. \u201cI need to make sure that Delivery-chan is alright. As her mentor, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of my student. If she needs additional treatment, then I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably going to be pretty hungry when she wakes up. Is lunch ready?\u201d Without waiting for his reply, Saitama sets his manga aside and walks to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I made enough that we could each have two servings, if needed. I anticipated that Delivery-chan would be hungry after her training session today.\u201d</p>\n<p>The intensity of his stare fades slightly and he lifts a hand. Metal fingertips hover just above where your hand is clutching the blanket. Your knuckles look a little raw, a little bruised. The fact that you liked his gifts had made him feel so proud, but he failed to realize that in your eagerness to train, you might hurt yourself. Maybe he should get some gloves for you, to protect your hands.</p>\n<p>Is that a normal thought that a teacher would have for a student? Would Saitama think the same about him? A glance in the direction of the kitchen reminds him of what was said before. The way that Genos thinks about you and those protective urges aren\u2019t normal for a teacher and student dynamic.</p>\n<p>Lightly, he rests his metal fingertips on the curve of your fingers. It isn\u2019t the same as skin-on-skin contact, but he can still feel it. The body heat, the texture of your skin. Sensors in the metal let him feel you and he slowly tilts his head when your eyelids flutter.</p>\n<p>A crush. That was what Saitama called these feelings. Now that he has identified that these are not normal for a teacher and student, Genos wants to determine how to proceed. Telling you that he has a crush on you is a good first step. He did confess to you earlier, but you were slipping in and out of consciousness so it\u2019s likely that you don\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? Did you tell her yet?\u201d Saitama is sitting at the table with his food, lifting some to his mouth before he continues. \u201cWait. Do you <em>want</em> her to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>That hadn\u2019t occurred to him. Genos had viewed this discovery as unlocking another step-by-step task. Like setting a goal with his training and working towards it. The next logical step after discovering his feelings would be to tell you and then begin a relationship with you. If he doesn\u2019t make his feelings clear to you, that will leave your teacher and student dynamic intact.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Genos seemed to have frozen after that question, Saitama sets his food aside. \u201cIf you really like her, you should tell her. The worst she can say is \u201cno\u201d. And if that happens, you can still be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I not tell her?\u201d Genos lifts his hand off of yours and turns his head, shifting his gaze from your unconscious form to his mentor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lifting a hand, he rubs at the back of his neck and tilts his head a little. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It can be kind of risky to confess your feelings, right? What if she doesn\u2019t feel the same way you do? It might make her uncomfortable if you confess and she doesn\u2019t like you back. I guess it <em>is</em> Delivery-chan so she might still be okay with\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, he turns his body to face the cyborg. \u201cGenos, you\u2019re going to tell her anyway, aren\u2019t you? Let\u2019s practice. Come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Genos casts a glance back to where you\u2019re asleep before leaving your side to sit closer to Saitama. Facing his mentor, he nods. \u201cAlright. I will pretend that I am telling Delivery-chan my feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just pretend that I\u2019m her and tell me how you feel.\u201d The bald hero rests an elbow on the table and gives him a nod. \u201cJust be direct.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d For a moment, the cyborg sits staring intensely back at Saitama. Unblinking, completely focused, as if he\u2019s calculating the best way to convey his feelings for you. Finally, after a full minute, he speaks again. \u201cDelivery-chan, I have developed inappropriate feelings for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an instant, Saitama\u2019s expression shifts from his usual deadpan face to something much more serious. Leaning forward, he rests a hand on his student\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGenos, no. Do you want to go to jail?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster? I was only stating my feelings-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust don\u2019t say it that way. You\u2019re going to sound creepy. Never say that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease coach me. My experience with confessing feelings is limited, but I can tell that you have much more experience in this area.\u201d Leaning closer, Genos is almost tempted to take notes. He\u2019s sure that Saitama has a lot of experience with romance and not just due to his age. Surely someone as powerful as his mentor has been approached by countless women and of course he\u2019s probably confessed his feelings plenty of times. Genos is sure that he hasn\u2019t been turned down.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah, uh, sure.\u201d Saitama is trying not to let it show that he, in fact, does not have experience in that field. He can\u2019t remember the last time he actually had a crush on someone, let alone the last time he confessed to someone.</p>\n<p>You have the misfortune of waking up across the room from them both just as Saitama is telling Genos to not stare. With your eyes focused on the ceiling, you can\u2019t see them, but you can hear them. The way the older hero is spouting some dating advice that sounds like the sagely sort of advice you\u2019d read in a shoujo manga. It\u2019s tempting to just sit up and excuse yourself to leave, but if you do that, you\u2019ll draw attention to yourself.</p>\n<p>If you let Genos know that you\u2019re awake, he\u2019s going to launch into a lecture. You know that you should\u2019ve been more careful when you were fighting those monsters, but it was your first time intentionally fighting them. It was your first time using those swords that he gifted you.</p>\n<p>You can feel pressure against your cheek, where he taped a gauze pad over your cuts. There\u2019s another pressure against your thigh, another bandage covering the deep wound there. Moving just a little beneath the blanket, your pulse quickens when you realize that the bandage is between your skin and the blanket with no barrier in between.</p>\n<p>Darting your eyes to the side, you hope to spot your pants and hoodie sitting off to the side. Your pulse accelerates further when you don\u2019t see them there. The sight of them hanging up outside makes your stomach clench and you chew at the inside of your cheek.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an awkward situation, to be lying there without pants with two guys talking romance a short distance away. The second that you sit up, they\u2019re going to look over. Even though you have a blanket covering you, this still feels weird. You know you can\u2019t just stay there, though.</p>\n<p>Pushing yourself to sit up, you tuck the blanket around your waist to keep your lower half covered. Though the fact that your wound was bandaged tells you that someone\u2019s already seen your legs, someone\u2019s already seen your panties, and you\u2019re pretty sure it wasn\u2019t Saitama. Your eyes fall briefly on Genos before lowering as they both turn their heads to look your way.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, cool. You\u2019re awake. Feeling okay?\u201d Saitama tilts his head, leaning a bit to the side so he can look at you directly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026yeah. I\u2019m okay. I just got a little banged up.\u201d You\u2019re not sure what to do now. Neither of them are making a move to get your pants and hoodie from the porch. You start to contemplate getting them yourself and just keeping the blanket wrapped around your waist, but Genos interrupts your thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery-chan, I have something important that I need to tell you.\u201d Leaving the table, he approaches where you\u2019re sitting on the floor.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re sure that he\u2019s going to lecture you about the way you handled those monsters. He\u2019s going to go on a rant about how careless you were, how a real hero never would have let themselves get as injured as you did. Anticipating the cyborg\u2019s lecture, you lower your head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have recently discovered that I have feelings for you that go beyond what a teacher should feel for their student. I\u2019m not sure when it began, but I have recently realized that these feelings towards you are romantic. Before you lost consciousness, I confessed to you that I have strange feelings for you, but I\u2019m not sure if you remember, so I wanted to tell you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blond cyborg leans closer and plants a hand on your shoulder. \u201cDelivery-chan. I am going to say this as directly as possible, just as my master advised. I have a crush on you and I would like for you to return my feelings. I want to begin a romantic relationship with you and I understand that you might not feel the same way, but like Master Saitama told me a few minutes ago that \u201cyou miss 100% of the chances you don\u2019t take\u201d. I believe that we should attempt a date so that both of us can be sure of our feelings and if you do feel the same way towards me, then we can make our relationship official.\u201d</p>\n<p>You stare back at him, unsure of what to say. It really felt like he hated you. Complaining about you to the delivery company, throwing a fit when his orders didn\u2019t have enough sauce or the restaurant forgot the disposable chopsticks or napkins, filming you so he could claim that you were late with the deliveries, and then the general sassiness that he always had when he talked to you. Looking back on it now, you almost wonder if it\u2019s like how little boys pick on the girls they like to try to get their attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have\u2026a crush on me?\u201d Saying it only deepens your confusion. Before you became his student, you were just the delivery girl. You had limited interaction. \u201cWhat do you like about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Both you and Saitama expect him to pause for a moment and consider the question, but apparently Genos already had a mental list of everything he likes about you. He likes your determination and speed, he likes your dedication to becoming stronger, he likes the fact that you\u2019re so willing to learn whatever he can teach you. Of course, there are more things that he likes as well. Things that take you by surprise.</p>\n<p>Genos likes how your voice sounds first thing in the morning. The way that your armored hoodie looks on you, the color of the fabric against your skin. He hasn\u2019t seen you smile much, but when you do smile, he thinks that it has a certain warmth to it that makes him feel\u2026equally warm. His thoughts have started to get a little fuzzy when he sees your smile or even thinks about it. Your thoughtfulness, your kindness, those softer things are what he goes deeper into detail about with no shred of embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So</em>? What do you think, Delivery-chan?\u201d Saitama nudges your elbow and raises an eyebrow, his expression ever so slightly smug.</p>\n<p>If Sonic finds out about this, you just know that he\u2019s going to try to fight Genos. You can already picture the fight and imagine him getting effortlessly hurled halfway across City Z with a hit from Saitama. Chewing at the inside of your cheek, you lower your eyes to the floor and try to think of what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you visit tomorrow, I would like for us to try a different activity. We will still train, but that will only be for a few hours. Please bring a change of clothes with you tomorrow.\u201d Genos leaves the table and you can hear him walk to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>With that over, you look towards the porch in the hopes of retrieving your pants and hoodie. Before you can even consider getting up, Genos is back and setting a bowl of food in front of you. A can of juice is set down beside it and he wordlessly sits beside you to begin eating his own meal.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. Since you\u2019re done training for the day, want to help me train in this game I borrowed?\u201d Saitama tilts his head when you look his way. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have anything else to do, right? Oh! By the way\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Turning, he retrieved the little black kitten from his futon and settled it onto your lap. \u201cThere you go. Nara was pretty worried about you, Delivery-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNara?\u201d Looking down at the kitten, you see it curling up and dozing off again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I came up with the name while you were training. It\u2019s pretty cool, right?\u201d</p>"
