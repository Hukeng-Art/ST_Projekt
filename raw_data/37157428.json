  "summary": "<p>Wei Ying was pretty sure his next door neighbor Lan Qiren hated him until he adopted A-Yuan. Now he\u2019s bringing by disgustingly healthy food, taking Wei Ying and A-Yuan to family dinners, and let\u2019s not even mention the nephews he keeps hinting Wei Ying should meet. Is it possible Wei Ying, consummate orphan, has found a family in his grumpy old neighbor?</p>",

  "text": "<p>When A-Yuan had first come to stay with Wei Ying, he\u2019d had a really bad ear infection and he\u2019d cried constantly and Lan Qiren had come knocking on Wei Ying\u2019s door with a scowl on his face.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren was Wei Ying\u2019s next door neighbor and possibly the biggest annoyance in his life. Before he\u2019d adopted A-Yuan, Lan Qiren had objected to every single thing Wei Ying did, from playing music (not even loudly!), to cooking spicy food (why would <em>he </em>have a problem with that?) to leaving his muddy boots in the hallway, to, Wei Ying didn\u2019t know. <em>Existing</em>, probably. It was like having another Aunt Yu in his life, honestly, except that all Lan Qiren could really do was threaten to call the landlord and get him evicted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said, when he opened the door to Lan Qiren\u2019s scowling face. \u201cNothing I do is working- he won\u2019t stop crying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe?\u201d Lan Qiren demanded, craning his head as if to look past Wei Ying. \u201cWhere did you get a child?\u201d Wei Ying rolled his eyes; typical of the man to assume Wei Ying had kidnapped a child or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin\u2019s,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t look after him any longer, so I took him in. It was that or let him go into foster care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remarkably, Lan Qiren\u2019s scowl lessened. \u201cThat\u2019s very responsible,\u201d he said. He paused. \u201cDoes he have an ear infection?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nodded and sighed.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren frowned at him. \u201cYou need to get some sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren are a lot of work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cThank you, Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day, just as Wei Ying had finally gotten A-Yuan to sleep, there was a knock on the door again. Wei Ying jerked the door open, biting his lip so he wouldn\u2019t just start yelling at whoever had knocked.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren stood there again. Wei Ying blinked at him. Lan Qiren offered Wei Ying a paper bag. \u201cI got some medicine,\u201d he told Wei Ying. \u201cI used to use it when my nephews had ear infections. It was very effective.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said, shocked, taking the bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe instructions are with the medicine,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cI also brought some candy the child might like, and some food. You\u2019re too skinny; it\u2019s not good for looking after a young child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They ran into Lan Qiren in the elevator a week later, A-Yuan snug in his stroller, Wei Ying blinking with exhaustion.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Lan Qiren greeted him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinked at him and wondered if he was imagining this.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is your cousin\u2019s baby?\u201d Lan Qiren asked.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nodded. \u201cThis is A-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren sank down on his haunches so he could smile at A-Yuan. Well, twist his mouth into something like a smile. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, seriously, to the small child.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan, who was gumming his fingers, looked at the old man.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have teethers for him,\u201d Lan Qiren advised, with a frown.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sighed. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have a lot of things I don\u2019t have. I haven\u2019t had time to go shopping or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren frowned. \u201cI still have some of my nephews\u2019 things in storage,\u201d he said. \u201cI will look through them and see what\u2019s there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just going to waste as they are,\u201d Lan Qiren declared, with a sniff. \u201cI had saved them for when my nephews had children, but at the rate they are going\u2026\u201d he scowled.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the marrying type?\u201d Wei Ying asked, a smile creeping onto his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Huan is married,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cTo a man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd A-Zhan is gay as well,\u201d Lan Qiren said, with a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wei Ying said, perhaps a little too flippantly. \u201cDon\u2019t give up too soon, Uncle. I\u2019m gay and I have a child now. Perhaps your nephews will as well?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren\u2019s face went thoughtful in a way Wei Ying had learned to be alarmed at on the face of any older person. The look of \u2018why are arranged marriages outdated again?\u2019 and \u2018if I try to set up my child, what\u2019s the worst they could do to me?\u2019 and \u2018I admit I am actually this desperate for a grandchild.\u2019</p>\n<p>Wei Ying suddenly wished he had not spoken. The last thing he wanted to do was to somehow end up going on a date with Lan Qiren\u2019s nephew, who would undoubtedly be just as rule-bound and disapproving of everything as Lan Qiren was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few days later, Wei Ying had just arrived home with A-Yuan after a long hard day of work when there was a knock on the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAiya!\u201d Wei Ying exclaimed. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAiya!\u201d A-Yuan repeated enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying cracked the door open, A-Yuan hiding behind his legs. It was Lan Qiren, holding a box. Behind him stood a very handsome man, holding a much larger box.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Wei Ying let his lust run away with him as he admired the way the man\u2019s tight pants hugged the curve of his ass and how his biceps were perfectly framed by his short-sleeve dress shirt.</p>\n<p><em>With my luck,</em> he thought, <em>this will be the married nephew and the unmarried one will be short and ugly.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cUncle!\u201d Wei Ying greeted him. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle!\u201d A-Yuan repeated, squeezing out from behind Wei Ying\u2019s legs and latching onto Lan Qiren.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought the items I mentioned the other day,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cMy nephew, A-Huan, helped me.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Huan smiled widely at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Uncle, you didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Wei Ying said, moving aside so Lan Qiren and A-Huan could enter the apartment. It was a much tighter fit with three grown men there.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo trouble,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cAs I said, they were just growing old in storage, since A-Huan and A-Yao refuse to adopt some children.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Huan smiled the smile of a person who has been asked when they were going to give their family children since they came of age.. \u201cThere\u2019s still time,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren huffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Lan Huan,\u201d A-Huan said, holding out a very nicely shaped hand to Wei Ying. Gods, he needed to get laid.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cAnd this is my little radish, A-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Huan nodded. \u201cUncle has told us all about him,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for brightening his life. As you have heard, his nephews have so far neglected to give him grandchildren.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard something to that respect,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cAh, do you want tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no need, no need,\u201d Lan Huan said. \u201cI really have to go! I\u2019m going to be late for A-Yao as it is.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Ah</em>, Wei Ying thought. <em>This is probably the </em>married<em> nephew.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Ying said, glad he wouldn\u2019t have to entertain- he really was exhausted. \u201cWell, thank you again. Huan-ge, uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make sure you feed that baby lots of soup,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cNot too spicy. Spice is bad for his health. Yours too, A-Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI\u2019m just about to make some soup now.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan was frowning up at him when he closed the door. \u201cSoup?\u201d he repeated, with a frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cFish fingers.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan cheered and clapped. \u201cFish fingers!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I really am a bad parent,</em> Wei Ying thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Wei Ying\u2019s surprise, the contents of the boxes, while old, really were nice; all well-made toys, wooden trains and blocks and some lovely stuffed animals that looked like they\u2019d been hand-sewn, as well as some very nice clothes that A-Yuan would grow into. A-Yuan immediately latched onto a stuffed rabbit, sewn from blue and white calico, and refused to go anywhere without it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lan Qiren said, when he next saw them. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s enjoying the things I brought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cThank you so much again.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan sucked on the stuffed rabbit's foot, hiding behind Wei Ying in feigned shyness.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was A-Zhan\u2019s favorite toy as well,\u201d Lan Qiren said, with a little sigh. \u201cOh, A-Ying, my nephew has sent me home with leftovers- you should take them as a meal for you and A-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no no, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Wei Ying said, remembering how horribly bland the last food Lan Qiren had brought him was.</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cYou\u2019re so thin- you\u2019re clearly not eating enough.\u201d He gave a frown that Wei Ying recognized from the aunties who ran the stalls in the market and were always forcing extra dumplings and pancakes on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Lan Qiren said again. \u201cWhen do you have time to cook? You\u2019re a single father. Take the food,\u201d and he forced a bag of takeout containers into Wei Ying\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cUm, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed as he let himself and A-Yuan into the apartment. \u201cThis is not the end of this,\u201d he told the child. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be boring food for life, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan chewed thoughtfully on the cloth rabbit\u2019s foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s all well and good for you,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cYou\u2019re eating rabbit for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly, Wei Ying\u2019s prediction had come through. Lan Qiren appeared with remarkable frequency. He must listen at his door, Wei Ying thought, dismally, accepting container after container of horribly healthy food, all steamed vegetables and freshly made tofu and bitter soup.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Wei Ying said, squeezing half a bottle of chili garlic sauce into his bowl. \u201cI\u2019ve never eaten this healthfully in my life. A-Yuan, you\u2019re going to have to be prepared for your baba to live for a very long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d A-Yuan said. The little traitor seemed to like Lan Qiren\u2019s food.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Lan Qiren said, the next time he saw them, \u201cwhat are you and A-Yuan doing for the Mid-Autumn Festival?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Wei Ying said, running his hand through his hair. \u201cI wanted to go to my sister\u2019s, but she lives too far away and I can\u2019t get enough time off of work, so I think we\u2019re just going to celebrate it, the two of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Lan Qiren said, sniffing. \u201cYou can\u2019t spend the Mid-Autumn Festival alone! It\u2019s a time for family. You\u2019ll come with me to my nephew\u2019s house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI can\u2019t intrude on your family gathering! It would be so rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, A-Ying,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be intruding anymore than that A-Yao is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinked, not sure what to do with this. Wasn\u2019t A-Yao Lan Huan\u2019s husband?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be improper for A-Yuan to not be able to celebrate the festival,\u201d Lan Qiren declared. \u201cHe should be raised in the proper traditions.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan looked up at Wei Ying, chewing on the stuffed rabbit. \u2018Proper,\u201d he said, pulling the foot out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sighed. <em>Might as well give in now,</em> he thought. He never won against meddling old people. That\u2019s how he always ended up coming home from the market stuffed with dumplings.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cA-Zhan is coming to pick me up at noon. Please make sure you and A-Yuan are ready.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>A-Zhan</em>, Wei Ying thought. <em>The probably ugly unmarried nephew</em>. <em>Great</em>. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said again. \u201cWhat should I bring?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring?\u201d Lan Qiren repeated, shocked. \u201cYou won\u2019t be bringing anything! A-Huan will provide everything!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying narrowed his eyes. Was this a trap? It sounded like a trap, like when your aunts and uncles force you to take gifts of money and then complain to Aunt Yu about how greedy you are. He\u2019d stop by the bakery and pick up some mooncakes, he thought. Lotus-seed ones; then he can just say that they are a tradition of his family. They couldn\u2019t possibly be construed as offensive in that light, could they?</p>\n<p>Satisfied he\u2019d avoided yet another pratfall, he closed the door and ushered A-Yuan into the kitchen. There were more stupidly healthy leftovers to get through.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course they weren\u2019t ready at noon. They would have been, except that Wei Ying\u2019s work had called with an emergency he\u2019d had to talk them through, then A-Yuan had peed himself in his excitement, then he\u2019d misplaced the stuffed rabbit and they\u2019d had to tear the apartment apart looking for it.</p>\n<p>When the doorbell rang, Wei Ying was sweaty and dusty from trying to lift furniture to look behind it, his hair sticking up all over the place, and A-Yuan was, for reasons only known to himself, running around with only a shirt on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re late, uncle!\u201d Wei Ying called, throwing open the door.</p>\n<p>He blinked, momentarily confused. He\u2019d thought it wasn\u2019t Lan Huan who would be picking them up, but there he was, looking even more gorgeous than he\u2019d looked last time.</p>\n<p>But no, Wei Ying, realized staring stupidly up at him. This wasn\u2019t Lan Huan. Lan Huan had had a wedding ring and a bright smile. This man had golden-brown eyes and an expression that seemed to bore straight through Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan snapped Wei Ying out of his stupor, barreling past Wei Ying and into the legs of the other nephew.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying remembered, suddenly, that his child was running around half-naked.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew blinked. Wei Ying noticed he was holding the stuffed rabbit tenderly in one hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cBunny!\u201d A-Yuan ordered, reaching up to the stuffed animal.</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew carefully handed the bunny over. \u201cI found him in the elevator,\u201d he said. His voice was just as beautiful as the rest of him.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan wrapped one arm around the beautiful man\u2019s leg and stuffed the bunny\u2019s foot into his mouth.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren bustled into the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying!\u201d he scolded as soon as he saw the tableau. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, sorry, uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cWe lost the rabbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren narrowed his eyes at the sight of the pants-less child chewing on the rabbit\u2019s food.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, go, go, get ready,\u201d he said, making a shooing gesture. \u201cCan\u2019t be late, that A-Yao will get all sniffy about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Wei Ying said, still feeling dazed. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 we\u2019ll just\u2026 come on, A-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grabbed his son\u2019s hand and tried to pull him gently into the apartment.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d A-Yuan protested. \u201cStay with gege!\u201d He gripped onto the beautiful nephew\u2019s leg more tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yuan!\u201d Wei Ying exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will come,\u201d the beautiful nephew said. He lifted A-Yuan up into his arms as if he didn\u2019t weigh an ounce and carried him past Wei Ying into the apartment. \u201cWhere are your pants?\u201d he heard the beautiful nephew asking A-Yuan, and A-Yuan\u2019s answering \u2018there\u2019.</p>\n<p>A snort from Lan Qiren made Wei Ying realize he was still standing in the doorway, gaping.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI\u2019ll just go get our things. Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFix your hair!\u201d Lan Qiren ordered, as Wei Ying wobbled back into the apartment. \u201cYou look like a hedgehog!\u201d</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew was watching approvingly as A-Yuan demonstrated his prowess in putting on his pants, ignoring the cramped mess that was their apartment. Wei Ying wandered into the tiny bathroom and splashed water onto his face, only remembering, when he wandered out into the kitchen area that he\u2019d gone in there to brush his hair. Feeling reckless, he finger combed it for a few seconds before grabbing the bag with all the things two year olds mysteriously needed and the shopping bag of mooncakes.</p>\n<p>He looked over and caught the beautiful nephew staring at him and blushed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hectic kind of\u2026 well, life. Thanks for helping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI put my pants on all by myself,\u201d A-Yuan boasted.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying smiled at him. \u201cYou took them off all by yourself too,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan grinned and stuck the bunny\u2019s foot back in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d the beautiful nephew asked, gently, and Wei Ying nodded and grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, little radish,\u201d he said to A-Yuan. \u201cGege and uncle and us are going to go celebrate the mid-autumn festival and have too much sugar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYay!\u201d A-Yuan cheered. \u201cSugar!\u201d He grabbed the beautiful nephew\u2019s hand and pulled him towards the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew\u2019s car was much too nice for Wei Ying\u2019s grubby trainers and A-Yuan\u2019s grubby paws. (How had he possibly managed to get so dirty? He\u2019d been clean, Wei Ying swore he had been clean when they left the apartment. Now his face was streaked with dirt. Where had it come from?)</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew frowned at Wei Ying. \u201cHe should have a car seat,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yeah,\u201d Wei Ying agreed, with a shrug. \u201cWe hardly ever ride in cars, though, so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew made a face as if he might be considering going somewhere there and then to buy a car seat, but Lan Qiren made an impatient noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything about that now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already late.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, the beautiful nephew gave in and opened the back door for Wei Ying and A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren spent the drive to Lan Huan\u2019s apartment catching his nephew up on all the gossip concerning people, Wei Ying, if he knew anything about aunts and uncles, would bet the beautiful nephew knew nothing about, though he made interested noises in all of the right places. He kept checking the rear view mirror and frowning, Wei Ying saw, especially whenever he had to use the breaks which, since they were in the middle of a city, was pretty much constantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Huan\u2019s place was <em>swank</em>. There was an underground parking garage and a doorman in a uniform and everything. Wei Ying whistled, earning a sharp look from Lan Qiren, who muttered something about A-Yao\u2019s needless ostentation.</p>\n<p>They rode up a very roomy and smooth elevator to one of the upper floors and Lan Qiren, as was his right as Uncle, opened and strode in the apartment without knocking, A-Yuan following closely behind him until Wei Ying yanked him back so he could pull off his shoes.</p>\n<p>Lan Huan breezed in as Wei Ying was struggling with his dirty trainers.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying!\u201d he said. \u201cA-Yuan! We\u2019re so happy Uncle convinced you to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for inviting us,\u201d Wei Ying said, politely, trying not to stare around the room in front of him. Lan Qiren hadn\u2019t been wrong about needless ostentation. He held out the shopping bag. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought some lotus seed mooncakes. They\u2019re traditional in my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank you so much!\u201d Lan Huan gushed, taking the shopping bag. \u201cI love trying new types of mooncakes! Where is your family from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cYunmeng.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYunmeng!\u201d Lan Huan exclaimed. \u201cWhat a beautiful place!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been there?\u201d Wei Ying asked, then suddenly realized he was blocking the entrance and the beautiful nephew had been waiting patiently to take off his shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he said, stepping aside, and wishing he\u2019d had the forethought <em>not </em>to wear his socks with the flying pigs on them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve visited Yunmeng a few times,\u201d Lan Huan said, leading Wei Ying across the gaudy living room. \u201cA-Yao\u2019s sister-in-law is from there. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p>\n<p>A small man was standing in an equally ostentatious dining room, having what looked like a very stilted conversation with Lan Qiren.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p>\n<p>\u201cYao-ge?\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYing-di!\u201d Meng Yao exclaimed. \u201cWhat a coincidence! And is this your son? I heard you adopted a cousin\u2019s child from Yanli.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Ying said, feeling for a moment that someone- the universe- had just played a colossal prank on him. \u201cThis is A-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already know each other?\u201d Lan Huan asked, pouring a cup of tea from a teapot on the dining room table and handing it to his uncle.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying is Yanli\u2019s didi,\u201d Meng Yao explained, dimpling in a way Wei Ying had never trusted.</p>\n<p>Four pairs of eyes settled uncomfortably on Wei Ying as he wondered exactly how much the Lans had heard about him. Nothing, he hoped, though Meng Yao was sure to change that.</p>\n<p>He laughed, awkwardly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping to visit her during the holiday, but she lives too far\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lan Huan said, sympathetically. \u201cMuch too far to travel for such a little boy for such a short time.\u201d He smiled down at A-Yuan, or tried to, but he wasn\u2019t by Wei Ying\u2019s feet, where he expected him to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yuan!\u201d Wei Ying exclaimed, turning and venturing back into the living room, where the little boy was playing some kind of game with the stuffed bunny and the beautiful nephew.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said, feeling all melty all of a sudden.</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew looked up at Wei Ying and didn\u2019t smile, exactly, but didn\u2019t not smile. His face was all soft and kind. Wei Ying sunk down onto an expensive looking sofa.</p>\n<p>The beautiful nephew turned back to A-Yuan. Somehow he seemed to have cleaned the dirt off of A-Yuan\u2019s hands and face in the short time A-Yuan had been out of Wei Ying\u2019s sight. He was making the little stuffed bunny hop around the Persian rug, pretending to eat the leaves and flowers woven in it, while A-Yuan laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Wei Ying whispered. A soft sound made him look up and he saw Lan Huan looking down at him, an amused look on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the beautiful nephew, Lan Zhan, drove them home with, as Wei Ying had predicted, vast quantities of slightly-less-healthy-than-usual leftovers. A-Yuan had drifted off to sleep, worn out from all the attention and excitement and sugar and Lan Zhan had carried him to the car as carefully as if he had been made out of spun sugar, putting him down gently in the backseat and buckling him in.</p>\n<p>When they got to the apartment building, Wei Ying was surprised when Lan Zhan parked and carried the baby up to Wei Ying\u2019s flat, where he laid him down in his little bed, tucking the stuffed rabbit in beside him while Wei Ying hovered, his arms full of plastic containers that he dumped onto the counter, then followed Lan Zhan out into the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was no trouble,\u201d Lan Zhan said, his ears going a little pink. Wei Ying\u2019s heart did a little bumpity-bumpity in his chest. He produced a thin wallet from somewhere and pulled out a business card. \u201cIf you need anything, please contact me,\u201d he said, handing Wei Ying the card.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, thank you, Zhan-ge,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI am not just being polite,\u201d Lan Zhan said, with a small frown. \u201cI mean it. A-Yuan is\u2026 good. You care for him all alone. Uncle is very fond of you.\u201d He held out the card again. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, thank you, Zhan-ge,\u201d Wei Ying said, taking it.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren appeared in the hallway. \u201cStill here, A-Zhan?\u201d he asked with a frown. \u201cYou should be home sleeping!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan did not sigh, but Wei Ying suspected that was only from a great deal of practice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Uncle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had suspected that Lan Qiren\u2019s fondness for A-Yuan and by proxy for him would dry up once the old man had heard all Meng Yao had to say on the subject of Wei Ying. Lan Qiren, after all, loved gossip and Meng Yao had it in spades. The whole sordid tale would come spinning out; Aunt Yu, the Wens, the other Wens, the money, and Lan Qiren\u2019s visits to saddle Wei Ying with impossible amounts of healthy food and twisted little smiles at A-Yuan would dry up and any very slight chance Wei Ying might have had with the beautiful nephew would be done with.</p>\n<p>But they didn\u2019t. A few days after the mid-autumn festival, Lan Qiren again showed up at their door, carrying yet more food.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten through half of the leftovers you gave me a few days ago. Take pity on my poor stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren snorted. \u201cYou should eat more,\u201d he insisted, shoving the containers into Wei Ying\u2019s arms. \u201cWhere is A-Yuan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt his aunt\u2019s house,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cShe was away for the holiday, so she took him home to spoil him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is good for him to have family,\u201d Lan Qiren said, approvingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI\u2019m glad he has so many people to rely on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will come for family dinner with us on Sunday,\u201d Lan Qiren said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wei Ying asked. \u201cI will?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren nodded. \u201cA-Zhan will be here at five. Please be ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They, of course, were not ready at five. They were ready at twenty minutes to five and then A-Yuan somehow managed to sneak into the bathroom and squirt an entire tube of toothpaste into his hair and when Lan Zhan knocked on the door Wei Ying was frantically trying to wash it out and A-Yuan was naked and both of them were soaking wet.</p>\n<p>He opened the door and grinned up at the beautiful man. \u201cAh, Zhan-ge,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cI understand that children are unpredictable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying laughed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s an understatement,\u201d he said, only catching A-Yuan\u2019s arm just in time as he tried to run past Wei Ying to hug Lan Zhan, still naked and soapy and soaking wet. \u201cLet me just finish dealing with this one, and then I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not feel that you need to rush,\u201d Lan Zhan told him. \u201cNo one will mind if we\u2019re a little late.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying smiled at him and herded A-Yuan back towards the bath-tub.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were back in the hallway a few minutes later, dried and dressed, Wei Ying carrying A-Yuan\u2019s bag in one hand and the stuffed bunny in the other.</p>\n<p>He knocked on Lan Qiren\u2019s door and the two emerged a moment later.</p>\n<p>\u201cZhan-gege!\u201d A-Yuan cried, jumping up into Lan Zhan\u2019s arms. Thankfully, the man had fast reflexes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cHe decided to wash his hair with toothpaste at the last minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren unsuccessfully tried to hide his smile.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan carried A-Yuan down to his car and then buckled him in and Wei Ying was so distracted by trying not to drool over the sight of the gorgeous man talking softly to his son that it took him a moment to realize that there was now a booster seat in Lan Zhan\u2019s car.</p>\n<p>\u201cZhan-ge!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou bought a booster seat for him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not like to drive with him unprotected,\u201d Lan Zhan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Wei Ying said, flabbergasted.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Lan Qiren scolded him. \u201cGet in the car- we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said, and scooted into the car, beside an A-Yuan who was looking very unhappy about the booster seat situation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At dinner Meng Yao smiled his faux-innocent dimply smile at Wei Ying and all the Lans acted completely normal towards them, as if Meng Yao hadn\u2019t spilled any of the business with Aunt Yu and the Wens and the Wens.</p>\n<p>He got his chance to ask him about it in the kitchen, volunteering to help him clean while the Lans took turns telling A-Yuan how precious he was. \u201cA-Yao,\u201d he said, drying the dishes while Meng Yao washed them. They were horrible, all gilt-edged, and dishwasher and microwave unsafe and it was honestly giving Wei Ying horrible anxiety just to be handling them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Ying-di,\u201d Meng Yao asked, turning his dimples on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Huan-ge or uncle about me,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>Meng Yao\u2019s dimples grew impossibly deeper. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wei Ying asked. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure uncle likes me better than you and I know you don\u2019t do well with\u2026 ah\u2026 competition.\u201d A ridiculous statement all around; Meng Yao was Lan Qiren\u2019s nephew in law, Wei Ying just an annoying neighbor, and yet he was pretty sure he knew how Meng Yao viewed the world.</p>\n<p>Meng Yao turned back to the dishes. \u201cA, A-Ying, I\u2019m playing the long game,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cSo you\u2019re using it as blackmail?\u201d</p>\n<p>Meng Yao tilted his pretty little head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be rivals, A-Ying,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could be\u2026 friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying bit his lip to keep from asking whether Meng Yao actually had any friends. He seemed like the type of society wife Aunt Yu had always disdained, who stabbed each other with words and could never be trusted. (Aunt Yu was the type of woman who could be trusted to always use an actual knife.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not, you know,\u201d Wei Ying began.</p>\n<p>Meng Yao raised his eyebrows at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing a game of any sort,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cLan Qiren just kind of\u2026 adopted me and A-Yuan? He forces food on me and drags me to these dinners? I don\u2019t know why- I\u2019m loud and annoying and kind of a trash panda, like you should see my apartment. This isn\u2019t\u2026 like I know I\u2019m the one who brought up the word \u2018competition\u2019, but I don\u2019t have any agenda.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, A-Ying,\u201d Meng Yao said, condescendingly. \u201c<em>I </em>know. You are the last person anyone would suspect of subterfuge. Besides, maybe, Lan Zhan. There\u2019s a boy who wears everything on his face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying looked at him, confused. \u201cLan Zhan\u2019s face is always completely blank,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, A-Ying,\u201d Meng Yao said, again. \u201cLook closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>On Tuesday there was a knock on the door shortly after Wei Ying and A-Yuan got home. He was exhausted; A-Yuan had basically refused to sleep at all the night before and Wei Ying had had meetings all day, the most frustrating kind of meeting, the kind where he was surrounded by idiots who were so senior in the company that even Wei Ying wasn\u2019t bold enough to tell them that they were wrong. </p>\n<p>He was a mess, he knew it; his hair all over the place, his button down stained in at least three places, bags under his eyes, and the apartment was worse. A-Yuan was in a stage of his development where he enjoyed nothing better than to empty all of the shelves and drawers he could reach onto the floor. But Lan Qiren was knocking on the door to bring him more of that really awfully healthy food, as he did every Tuesday and Thursday, so he had to answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d A-Yuan said, and giggled. He wasn\u2019t showing any evidence of recent sleep deprivation, the tiny asshole.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying threw the door open and smiled at Lan Qiren.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t Lan Qiren. It was the beautiful nephew. <em>Fuck my life</em>, Wei Ying thought, as his polite smile slid from his face and he suddenly became aware of every deficit in his wardrobe.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Zhan-ge!\u201d he said out-loud. \u201cWhat a surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan said. He held out the usual packages of leftovers. \u201cUncle suggested I bring these to you personally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh?\u201d Wei Ying asked. \u201cThese are\u2026 you\u2019re the cook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan said again. \u201cUncle is not good at cooking.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cWei Ying, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just the joys of parenthood, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan said.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stared at him confused. \u201cNo?\u201d he asked, finally.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cI don\u2019t have children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cYes, I know. Your uncle enjoys talking about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would like to,\u201d Lan Zhan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk about it?\u201d Wei Ying asked. He was way too tired for this.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave children,\u201d Lan Zhan said, sincerely.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said, and blinked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Lan Zhan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t sleep for\u2026\u201d he looked at his wrist. He wasn\u2019t wearing a watch, so he shrugged and gave up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sleep?\u201d Lan Zhan asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe baby,\u201d Wei Ying sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s not really into sleeping at the moment.\u201d He stifled a yawn.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should sleep,\u201d Lan Zhan said.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinked at him and refused to allow any insulting or sarcastic remarks to come out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can watch A-Yuan,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cIf you want to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow?\u201d Wei Ying asked, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not currently occupied,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cI would be happy to help. A-Yuan is a delightful child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said. He should probably say \u2018no\u2019 to this. This was one of those things you were supposed to say \u2018no\u2019 to, like when your wealthy classmate\u2019s family invites you on their family vacation to an expensive theme park and of course you say \u2018yes\u2019, you\u2019re a young child, but then your aunt finds out and ohhhhh boyyyyy\u2026</p>\n<p>But he was soooooo tired. And Lan Zhan was so sincere.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Ying said, and led the way into the apartment.</p>\n<p>\u201cGege!\u201d A-Yuan called, running to Lan Zhan and latching onto his leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Wei Ying said, looking around at the apartment and wincing at the distruction.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sleep,\u201d Lan Zhan said, indicating the bedroom. \u201cI will take care of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cOkay.\u201d And he more or less stumbled into the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took a few minutes, when he woke in the morning, to remember that Lan Zhan had been there the night before. It was only when he took the first sip of his coffee and blearily rummaged around for some breakfast, that he realized the apartment was clean. Everything A-Yuan had pulled off of shelves and out of cupboards was back in its right place. The dishes were washed, the fridge tidied, the floors vacuumed\u2026 Wei Ying blinked in shock tried to figure out what had happened? Had Yanli visited in the middle of the night? Had Wei Ying, in his sleep deprived state, hired a cleaning company? </p>\n<p>It was only when A-Yuan wandered out of the bedroom, hair sticking up in all directions, naked stick legs poking out from under his over large sleep shirt, the stuffed bunny held by one leg, and sleepily asked \u201cwhere\u2019s Zhan-gege?\u201d that Wei Ying realized. Lan Zhan must have cleaned his apartment.</p>\n<p>\u201cAiya!\u201d Wei Ying exclaimed, sitting down heavily on the couch. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d A-Yuan repeated happily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s regular and, he can not stress this enough, unsolicited, meal deliveries happened on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Lan Qiren would hear him and A-Yuan returning and a minute later he\u2019d be knocking on the door. At first he\u2019d just stand in the hallway, shoving unfortunately healthy food at Wei Ying, but as time went on he\u2019d made his way further and further into Wei Ying\u2019s apartment, like grass encroaching on a flower bed. Soon he was drinking Wei Ying\u2019s no doubt very substandard tea, carefully and pointedly avoiding the sticky spots on the table, and making small talk with Wei Ying which mostly consisted of giving Wei Ying unsolicited (and often completely irrelevant) advice while Wei Ying made small noises of agreement from time to time, although Lan Qiren also did a considerable amount of telling Wei Ying stories about things and people he didn\u2019t care about.</p>\n<p>When Lan Qiren barged his way in on Thursday, he stopped, in shock, upon sight of Wei Ying\u2019s for-once-not-a-diaster-zone apartment. <em>It hadn\u2019t been </em>that<em> bad,</em> Wei Ying thought, inaccurately.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour nephew cleaned my apartment,\u201d Wei Ying explained.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren turned his startled expression on Wei Ying, who raised his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him too,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just told me to go to sleep and then he cleaned and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren\u2019s expression did not improve.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, ah, he brought by some leftovers,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cThank you for that, by the way, and then he saw how tired I was, because of A-Yuan\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d A-Yuan said brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201c... and offered to watch A-Yuan while I took a nap, and then while I was napping he cleaned. He didn\u2019t\u2026 we didn\u2019t sleep <em>together</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Qiren said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very kind of him though,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cYou taught him well. He\u2019s a very respectful, considerate individual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren huffed, as if there had never been any question of his nephew\u2019s superiority. And, well, there hadn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to sleep with him?\u201d Lan Qiren demanded.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying flushed. \u201cWell, I mean, he\u2019s very\u2026\u201d he began, with no idea where he was going with this.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a very good job,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cHe\u2019s handsome. Hard working, good manners, proper. He is a very good cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying smiled and turned to make some tea. \u201cAh, uncle, I know, I know! He\u2019s unquestionably a catch! Some young man will be very happy when he decides to settle down\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s ready now,\u201d Lan Qiren said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, is he?\u201d Wei Ying asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s very fond of A-Yuan,\u201d Lan Qiren said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wei Ying said, turning to smile at the boy, who was playing with a set of Lan Qiren\u2019s hand-me-down blocks on the rug and humming tunelessly to himself. \u201cA-Yuan is a good boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Qiren said, fondly. \u201cI know you don\u2019t have parents to help you find a good partner,\u201d he continued, doggedly. \u201cPerhaps you will let me do you this favor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wei Ying asked, alarmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and A-Zhan are both so shy,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cI will arrange a date for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth popped open. No one had ever called him \u2018shy\u2019 before. \u201cUncle,\u201d he said. \u201cI really\u2026 you\u2019re so kind but\u2026 Uncle, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like A-Zhan?\u201d Lan Qiren asked, sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cNo, he\u2019s very\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t see what the problem is,\u201d Lan Qiren said.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle,\u201d Wei Ying said, pouring him more of the sub-standard tea. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be a good partner for your nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh?\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cAnd why not? Will you be unfaithful?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Ying asked. \u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a decent job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy job is okay,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlenty of opportunity for advancement,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cYou told me that yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Ying allowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you must have a good education, to get such a good job,\u201d Lan Qiren continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty good,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you are a good parent to your child,\u201d Lan Qiren continued. \u201cIt is very responsible to take on a family member\u2019s child. Shows good character.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, uncle,\u201d Wei Ying said, feeling rather stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you are a handsome young man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThough you should comb your hair more often.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying found his hand creeping up to smooth down his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem then?\u201d Lan Qiren asked, sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d Wei Ying took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I caused a scandal. To my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lan Qiren sniffed. \u201cThat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew about it?\u201d Wei Ying asked, surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know who you are, Wei Ying?\u201d Lan Qiren demanded. \u201cI knew your mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were in school together,\u201d Lan Qiren reminisced. \u201cShe was a troublemaker, always trying to get the students to protest this and that. But a good person. She had a good heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about her,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cYu Ziyuan hated her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Fengmian was always such a pushover!\u201d Lan Qiren exclaimed. \u201cNever had an original thought in his head!\u201d He sighed. \u201cI am not surprised Yu Ziyuan covered her ass and blamed everything on you. It\u2019s her style.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it <em>was</em> my fault,\u201d Wei Ying protested. \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did what you thought was right,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cAnd your family failed to support you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sat down heavily. \u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren huffed again. \u201cI might be old, but I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never thought you were\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate that you do not wish to taint A-Zhan with your scandal,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cBut the Lans are a family of principle. We are not so easily swayed by public opinions as the Jiangs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that your only objection to dating A-Zhan?\u201d Lan Qiren asked. \u201cPerhaps you have romantic attachments elsewhere? The young woman who often takes A-Yuan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s A-Yuan\u2019s aunt. She\u2019s just a friend. No, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren nodded, satisfied. \u201cYou should give A-Zhan a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe does seem very quiet and rigid before you know him\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s rigid at all. He\u2019s been very kind to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let me help you,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cI will arrange a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying felt himself give up. Why was he such a sucker for old people? \u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The date was arranged for Saturday night, Lan Qiren graciously offering Lan Huan\u2019s babysitting services.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo soon!\u201d he groused to Yanli on the phone, rummaging through his wardrobe. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d had some respectable clothing <em>somewhere</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s for the best,\u201d Yanli said, sounding amused. \u201cHe still expects you to join them for family dinner, doesn\u2019t he? How awkward would that be, having a date set up, but being surrounded by his family first? You wouldn\u2019t know where to look! Are you excited, A-Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Wei Ying complained, rejecting shirt after shirt. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s interested in me. Yanli, have you met him? He\u2019s so <em>gorgeous</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I met him,\u201d Yanli said. \u201cI went to A-Huan and A-Yao\u2019s wedding, remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, was it gaudy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was so awful,\u201d Yanli giggled. \u201cPoor A-Yao inherited his father\u2019s terrible taste. And A-Huan isn\u2019t much better. Oh, you should ask A-Huan to show you his wedding album the next time you are at his place. A-Xuan said they took a scrapbooking course. I bet it\u2019s <em>incredible</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Wei Ying cried. \u201cI can just imagine A-Huan showing me how they entered the reception hall with a smoke machine at full blast or whatever and me unable to stop from laughing. Poor A-Huan doesn\u2019t deserve that, not when his uncle has so kindly volunteered his babysitting services.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have a smoke machine,\u201d Yanli said, thoughtfully. \u201cPeacocks though\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Wei Ying cried, laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, A-Ying, you\u2019re also pretty gorgeous, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have hair like a hedgehog,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHedgehogs are cute,\u201d Yanli teased. \u201cI think maybe you should try to think positive and give it a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Wei Ying whined, flopping down on his bed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, jie. He\u2019s so <em>perfect!</em> If I give it a chance I\u2019m one hundred percent going to get my heart broken. And then it will turn out he was just humoring his uncle and find someone better and I\u2019ll be stuck dragged along with Lan Qiren to Lan family dinners and hearing his uncle go on and on about his much better partner and I\u2019ll wither away and die of lovesickness and my poor radish will be an orphan twice over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, poor A-Ying,\u201d Yanli said, not sounding sympathetic at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to move, jie!\u201d Wei Ying cried. \u201cI\u2019ll have to find a new apartment because I won\u2019t be able to deal with the whole Lan thing. You don\u2019t understand how serious this is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand not wanting to take risks because you\u2019re afraid of leaving yourself vulnerable,\u201d she said, softly. \u201cBut it will be worth it. Give him a chance. Oh- wear that black button down with the red polka-dots. And your skinny black jeans. Give him a chance to really appreciate your ass.\u201d He could practially hear her exaggerated wink.</p>\n<p>\u201cJie, you\u2019re the worst,\u201d Wei Ying said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wore his skinny black jeans and his black button down with the red polka dots and put enough product in his hair that he looked like a wet hedgehog, which he supposed was an improvement, and A-Yuan was so excited to go to Huan-ge and Yao-ge\u2019s for dinner he managed to somehow spill juice all over both him and Wei Ying a minute before Lan Zhan was due to show up to drive them to A-Huan\u2019s house. (How?!? He hadn\u2019t even been drinking juice!)</p>\n<p>Wei Ying answered the door topless, then realized he was topless and blushed bright red.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Zhan-ge!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cSorry! A-Yuan made a mess again.\u201d He almost raised his hand to cover his nipples before fortunately realizing how ridiculous that would look and stopped.</p>\n<p>\u201cI made a mess!\u201d A-Yuan cried, running to wrap himself around Lan Zhan\u2019s leg, completely naked this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will help A-Yuan put on some clean clothing,\u201d Lan Zhan offered, \u201cwhile you find a new shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>This would have been a sensible and generous offer, except that the one bedroom was very small, what with the two beds and two dressers and Wei Ying\u2019s wardrobe and two adult men and one naked wriggling boy and Wei Ying found himself bending over to rummage around in his dresser with his ass very close to Lan Zhan\u2019s face in his very tight tight black jeans.</p>\n<p>It was an impression, he supposed, pulling out the first dinner-date worthy shirt he came across, a silky, slinky purple shirt Jiang Cheng had given him, possibly as a joke.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan, meanwhile, was much more comfortably dressed in pink pants and a dinosaur t-shirt, and Lan Zhan grabbed his bag and asked Wei Ying if he was ready to go. Wei Ying, of course, then spent two minutes running around the apartment like a chicken with his head cut off, looking for his phone, keys, and wallet, all of which, it turned out, he\u2019d sensibly left beside the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he told Lan Zhan, as he slid into Lan Zhan\u2019s passenger seat. A-Yuan was in the back, in the booster seat Lan Zhan had gotten for him, happily singing a song about bunnies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Lan Zhan said, confidently pulling out of the tight spot he\u2019d parallel-parked into. \u201cI budgeted time for A-Yuan to have made a mess into my schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying couldn\u2019t help grinning at him. \u201cYou noticed the trend, huh?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou should know he does it specially for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d Lan Zhan said, with a tiny little adorable smile. Wei Ying\u2019s heart did a horrible fluttery thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cI know your uncle put you up to this date\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Lan Zhan said, coming to a stop at a red light, and looking over at Wei Ying. \u201cI put him up to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Ying asked. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cUncle is, of course, very eager for me to settle down, and thinks very highly of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying narrowed his eyes. \u201cHe does?\u201d It sounded fake.</p>\n<p>The light turned green and Lan Zhan started driving again. \u201cBut it was my idea,\u201d he continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying said. \u201cAre you sure? Because he\u2019s been talking you up to me for a while now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan did one of those adorable little smiles again. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They went to a fancy Italian place for dinner, which was actually a little annoying, because Wei Ying really wanted to get the cheese ravioli, but he had hopes for this date now and they did not include having an attack of lactose intolerance. Instead he got fettuccine with red sauce and failed to taste a single bite of it. Lan Zhan, bless his heart, got a fancy salad with cranberries and pomegranates and endives, whatever those were, and ate it delicately, one leaf at a time. He was so cute Wei Ying wanted to coo over him.</p>\n<p>He did not. Instead he made awkward conversation. \u201cSo you work for your family\u2019s company?\u201d he asked (he did), and \u201cdo you have any hobbies?\u201d (playing the guqin and doing tai chi), and \u201cwhere was the last place you went on vacation\u201d (Thailand, spending a few days there after a business conference. He enjoyed the cuisine and the climate).</p>\n<p>The conversation flailed around until they hit on the topic of A-Yuan, whom Wei Ying had endless stories about, which Lan Zhan seemed contented to listen to.</p>\n<p>In the end the dinner went so well Wei Ying decided to forego getting tiramisu for dessert, in the hopes that perhap Lan Zhan would be interested in continuing this date elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen is Huan-ge expecting us to pick up A-Yuan?\u201d Wei Ying asked as they stepped out of the restaurant doors.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot until later. He and A-Yao are very pleased to be babysitting,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping to become parents soon. Would you like to walk for a bit?\u201d He gestures to the street lined with restaurants and bars.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Wei Ying agreed, pleased. \u201cHow, exactly, are they going to become parents?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGe keeps talking about adoption, but I suspect A-Yao is thinking more along the lines of kidnapping,\u201d Lan Zhan said, dryly.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying laughed at this unexpected joke. \u201cDo you think he\u2019d try to justify it to Huan-ge or he\u2019d just lie about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cHe\u2019d just distract Huan-ge everytime he tried to ask questions. That\u2019s what he did with the flowers for the wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe flowers for their wedding were shady?\u201d Wei Ying asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cA-Yao hired one of his more dubious contacts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what does that mean?\u201d Wei Ying demanded. \u201cWhat, exactly, does a shady flower dealer entail? Are the flowers stolen? Repurposed from a funeral, perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not wish to ask questions and draw attention to myself,\u201d Lan Zhan said, and Wei Ying wondered if he was just trolling him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying took a chance and slipped his hand into the crook of Lan Zhan\u2019s arm. He looked up and smiled when he saw the tips of Lan Zhan\u2019s ears going red.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy jie said that their wedding was awful,\u201d he said, Lan Zhan\u2019s side brushed against his as he walked and his insides burning with warmth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d Lan Zhan agreed. \u201cThere was gold everywhere. There was an MC. Uncle was appalled. Ge <em>loved </em>it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwww,\u201d Wei Ying said, imagining Lan Huan\u2019s warm smile. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very sweet,\u201d Lan Zhan said. \u201cA-Yao may have a questionable background, but he makes ge very happy. It is worth forgiving him for his terrible sense of taste and possible criminal connections.\u201d</p>\n<p>They reached the water front and stood there for a moment, watching the light reflect off the black water, their shoulders brushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make me very happy too, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan said, still looking out at the water. Wei Ying\u2019s chest constricted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do?\u201d he squeaked. He turned and looked at Lan Zhan, who was looking back at him. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish to know you better,\u201d Lan Zhan said, and leaned forward and kissed him.</p>\n<p>It was warm and gentle and wet and addicting. As soon as they pulled away Wei Ying knew he would want more and more and more. Lan Zhan rested his forehead against Wei Ying\u2019s for a moment, his hands wrapped around Wei Ying\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, want that too,\u201d Wei Ying whispered back, and Lan Zhan smiled a very small very soft smile and kissed him again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Ying and Lan Zhan had a very small, very respectable wedding, in a small nondenominational chapel with minimal wedding arrangements, with A-Yuan looking very cute in his little suit, Lan Huan and A-Yao sat in the front row looking a little miffed that the grooms had ignored all of their suggestions, Yanli beamed with happiness and pride, and Lan Qiren sat front and center smirking with satisfaction.</p>"
