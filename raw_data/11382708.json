  "text": "<p>Romance wasn\u2019t something Todoroki ever had any interest in.</p>\n<p>Whatever. It's not like he\u00a0had the perfect example of a functional relationship growing up.</p>\n<p>However, Midoriya quite literally punched his way into Todoroki\u2019s life, and Todoroki has been drowning ever since.</p>\n<p>You\u2019d think, after two years, it would get easier. You\u2019d think his stomach would squeeze less \u2013 you\u2019d think his heart would stop sputtering\u2013 you\u2019d think, but ha, no. It gets worse, of course. Midoriya considers him a close friend, and vice versa, so late Friday pizza parties and quote unquote\u00a0<em>sleepovers\u00a0</em>become the norm. (They're not supposed to leave their dorms past midnight, but they tastefully break that rule.)</p>\n<p>Midoriya makes him laugh. Midoriya makes him\u00a0<em>happy.\u00a0</em>Midoriya actually cares about him.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Todoroki knows the exact day/minute/second that Todoroki fell down the metaphorical hole. Todoroki isn\u2019t a feelings expert, but he knew he was fucked when Midoriya damn near killed himself trying to help Todoroki with his own daddy issues. The scar on his hand is a forever reminder.</p>\n<p>In summer, Midoriya walks on his right, and sways against his shoulder. In winter, he clutches onto his left arm and falls asleep against his neck. He\u2019s not even sure if Midoriya is self-aware \u2013 but Todoroki sure as hell won\u2019t stop him. Todoroki has had avid practice in keeping his body from freezing and/or burning Midoryia\u2019s skin. Hurting him is Todoroki\u2019s worst nightmare.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure where the possessiveness comes from, but by senior year, Todoroki is a hundred percent sure he would personally sucker punch anyone that had anything mean to say about Midoriya. Everyone in Class A, B, and C is aware of this. Midoriya is the only good thing left on this damn planet, and seeing him sad makes Todoroki breathe smoke.</p>\n<p>Now, not to say Todoroki underestimates him, because Midoriya is perfectly capable of taking care of himself. Sometimes Midoriya still struggles to contain his quirk, but Todoroki is sure he could beat the shit out of anyone if he really wanted to \u2013 they\u2019ve fought side by side. Todoroki has felt a portion of the power under his skin and it\u2019s\u00a0<em>alive,\u00a0</em>something Todoroki sure as hell won\u2019t fuck with, thanks.</p>\n<p>But even as a senior, Midoriya carries a sense of purity. He still wants to make the world a better place. He still wants to\u00a0<em>genuinely\u00a0</em>help people, and Todoroki will protect that with his dying breath.</p>\n<p>So when some ass in the general studies class heckles Midoriya to borderline tears, Todoroki thinks no,\u00a0<em>impossible.\u00a0</em>Love cannot make you weak, because by god, Todoroki has never, ever felt stronger.</p>\n<p>(He almost got suspended for freezing the guy\u2019s feet to the gym floor. Don\u2019t tell Midoriya).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBrrrrr,\u201d Midoriya trembles aloud, black gloves rubbing against his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s so c-cold today!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a wuss,\u201d Bakugou says, in a light jacket and shorts, as they walk through the snow. He angrily stabs a piece of trash with his stick, and stuffs it in a bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Iida shrugs. \u201cI think it was colder yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>f-fair,\u201d Midoriya laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re two dragons and an\u00a0<em>engine.\u00a0</em>If I k-knew we were doing community service today, I would\u2019ve dressed w-warmer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis \u2018<em>field trip\u2019\u00a0</em>is bullshit, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Bakugou picks up a piece of cardboard, and burns it instantly. Iida shrieks about the environmental repercussions.</p>\n<p>Across the street, Todoroki can see Yaoyorozu pull a jacket from her stomach, and hand it to Ochako. The smaller girl bows graciously, once, twice.</p>\n<p>Todoroki silently places more trash in his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cW-w-well, I mean\u2026I know\u00a0<em>why\u00a0</em>we have to do it. Heroes serve the c-community-\u201d Midoriya shivers.</p>\n<p>Bakugou snaps, \u201cShut up. God. Go clean somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki glares in his direction, and Bakugou glares back. Midoriya isn\u2019t even phased.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya is correct,\u201d Iida nods, tying off his third bag already. \u201cThis is what\u00a0<em>true\u00a0</em>heroism is. Making the world a better place!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be picking trash off the fucking road when I graduate.\u201d</p>\n<p>It starts to snow.</p>\n<p>Midoriya is all muscle mass; there\u2019s not much fat left on him anymore \u2013 yet he still manages to look slim in his jacket. He shivers horribly, and Todoroki\u2019s heartstrings pull into his throat. He wants to tug him against his side, and smooth his hands down Midoriya\u2019s skin until he melts.</p>\n<p>Bakugou ignites his palms once, and casually rubs his hand over his face. He\u2019s cold too.</p>\n<p>Todoroki sets down his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya. Come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in Todoroki swells at the fact that Midoriya immediately stops what he\u2019s doing, and bounces to Todoroki\u2019s side. He smiles, shaking the snow out of his hair, \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki holds out his left palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya gasps happily, and grips Todoroki\u2019s fingers with both hands. Todoroki warms his palm, and Midoriya shuffles closer.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cAhhhh,\u201d\u00a0</em>he sighs. He leans even closer, against Todoroki\u2019s left side, and Todoroki lets him. He can\u2019t feel the bite of the weather, but he can feel how cold Midoriya is. He knows the resting temperature of Midoriya\u2019s body \u2013 and his current state is a little concerning. Midoriya\u2019s jacket really\u00a0<em>is\u00a0</em>too light for this weather. Bakugou rolls his eyes, and stabs too hard into the snow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour nose is turning blue,\u201d Todoroki comments.</p>\n<p>Midoriya shivers, \u201cI know.\u201d His eyelashes stick together. \u201cI can\u2019t feel it anymore, haha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki isn\u2019t really thinking when he lifts his hand out of Midoriya\u2019s grip, and softly pinches his nose. It warms instantly under his fingers. Midoriya makes a soft, nasally exhale.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my\u00a0<em>gosh,\u00a0</em>that feels so much better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGay,\u201d Bakugou snarks.</p>\n<p>Todoroki doesn\u2019t blink at Bakugou\u2019s words. His face warms more knowing that Midoriya doesn\u2019t seem to mind the comment either.</p>\n<p>With incredible aim, Jirou throws her pole like a javelin, and nails Bakugou right in the back. He wails, turning around to yell, but gets a face full of trash.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a\u00a0<em>fucking\u00a0</em>homophobe,\u201d Jirou snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u00a0<em>not!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou kinda\u2019 are.\u201d Kirishima shrugs. \u201c<em>So</em>\u00a0not manly, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou starts yelling, and Aizawa threatens to send them all packing.</p>\n<p>Midoriya has warmed considerably. He\u2019s stopped shaking, so he steps away, rubbing at his face with his palms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThank you!\u201d Midoriya beams.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s heart stops a little, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>He resists the urge to blow steam across Midoriya\u2019s freckles, and warm up his little face. He figures that\u2019s crossing a line. Somehow, he figures Midoriya wouldn\u2019t mind.</p>\n<p>Yaoyorozu wanders over, dragging full bags with Ochako. She politely waves, \u201cAre you cold, Midoriya? I can make you a thicker coat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Midoriya bounces. \u201cThat\u2019d be great! Thank you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki frowns. He goes back to picking up trash, stabbing a can and shoving it in his bag. He\u2019s not upset.</p>\n<p>Iida is smirking like a motherfucker; Todoroki tries to ignore him. Yaoyorozu makes him a fine coat, and Midoriya fits into it, snuggly and cute, snow still collecting in his sweet curly hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many complained about U.A. becoming a boarding school, but Todoroki was grateful. He never liked spending much time at home anyways.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes he\u2019s required to visit \u2013 and it\u2019s never the same. It\u2019s not like when Midoriya invites him for dinner, his mother smiling and warm and\u00a0<em>proud,\u00a0</em>proud of them both.</p>\n<p>He loves his siblings, honestly, but his home is cold and lonely, and Todoroki counts the days until he can go back to school. Midoriya is always counting with him, and Todoroki appreciates that more than he can express. There\u2019s a lot of things about Midoriya that Todoroki has come to adore.</p>\n<p>For one, watching Midoriya carry something ten times his body weight will never\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>be attractive.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s watched him (slowly) learn control \u2013 and now the veins in his body glow, as he lifts a car in search of survivors.</p>\n<p>Todoroki knows he should be focusing on the mission at hand. They\u2019re just interns, for now, called out to do search and rescue from a recent landslide. However, the area was cleared out long ago. Shouji walks around with three ears, and says there\u2019s nothing. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya is persistent otherwise, lifting a slab of concrete on his shoulder, and crouching to dig through more rubble. Todoroki feels dizzy, it\u2019s so fucking hot.</p>\n<p>The concrete slab is thrown back to the ground, and Midoriya\u2019s body cools. He frowns, rubbing at his forehead, \u201cI\u2019ve checked this whole area. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShame. Keep looking,\u201d Todoroki deadpans. He can hear Sero laughing, the bastard.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Shouji calls. \u201cIt\u2019s not a person, but I think there\u2019s an animal trapped down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sero stops mid laugh, and turns on his heel. Midoriya comes running as well, Todoroki not far behind. There\u2019s a huge piece of a collapsed bridge atop a car. Shouji is able to rock it, barely, but not enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too heavy,\u201d Shouji pushes, with six arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on. I can give us some leverage.\u201d Sero aims his tape, wrapping it around one of the bars of the broken bridge piece, and cutting off the tape. He grabs another one, and hands it to Todoroki.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pull, if you two push.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s body ignites, red rushing through him. He nods, determined, \u201cGot it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s much easier than Todoroki expected. With Midoriya\u2019s added strength, the large slab falls onto its side, and reveals the crushed car underneath. They breathe a sigh of relief when there\u2019s a muffled bark from inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of bastard leaves their dog inside a car?\u201d Sero frowns. Midoriya is already ripping the door off the car, gently crawling inside what\u2019s left, and pulling out an itty bitty teacup Chihuahua.</p>\n<p>Midoriya lifts him up with a smile, \u201cHe seems okay.\u201d\u00a0 The dog licks his face, shaking in his arms, and Midoriya giggles. It should be illegal for someone to be so sexy one second, and downright adorable the next.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thank god.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki sighs, \u201cDo you think we should go find Backdraft?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sero pats him on the back. He gives Todoroki some kind of\u00a0<em>knowing\u00a0</em>look.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Staying after class isn\u2019t usually his thing. Iida, Yaorozuru, even Midoriya \u2013 they\u2019re usually the ones to stay past the bell, and clean the chalkboards.</p>\n<p>However, today was one of All Might\u2019s in-class lectures, and honestly, the idea of going home leaves a foul taste in Todoroki\u2019s mouth. He busies himself with cleaning the classroom, organizing pencils just to turn his attention else-ware, far from sweet freckled boys.</p>\n<p>All Might\u2019s voice shocks him from his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung Shouto,\u201d All Might flips through his papers, looking up through sunken eyes. \u201cAre you not going home for the weekend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki hesitates by the chalkboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026I need to take these files up to the U.A. headquarters.\u201d All Might stands, \u201cSuper classified stuff. I could use an escort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki chews on his cheek to fight off a smile, and nods.</p>\n<p>They walk in silence through the halls. There\u2019s something warm about All Might, despite his inability to transform anymore. He radiates a protective aura, one that makes you feel safe standing in his seven foot shadow.</p>\n<p>All Might asks him about school, and Todoroki gives him honest answers. They peacefully walk through the courtyard. It\u2019s getting warmer outside. There\u2019s a pair of birds that fly between trees, one chasing the other, chirping and flittering around branches.</p>\n<p>Todoroki chooses his words carefully. He mulls them over. Thinks yes, no, maybe, \u00a0before asking, \u201cAll Might Sensei?\u201d</p>\n<p>His teacher looks down, adjusting the papers under his lanky arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki holds his breath. He exhales.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that love and heroism can co-exist?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might stops walking. Todoroki stops too.</p>\n<p>Rather than surprised, All Might looks thoughtful. Like he\u2019s genuinely intrigued at the concept. He starts walking again, Todoroki at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite interesting, Young Shouto. In what terms?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Todoroki shrugs. \u201cSafety. Plausibility.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so,\u201d All Might hums. \u201cMany consider love to be a weakness, but I\u2019ve found it to be more of a strength.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA strength?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA motivation,\u201d All Might smiles. \u201cIn the last fights of my prime, I was propelled past my limit when faced with securing the safety of a certain plain-looking boy.\u201d He laughs, \u201cA different type of love than what you\u2019re probably thinking, but a similar concept, I\u2019d believe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki swallows hard, and feels his face warm. All Might laughs loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the same young man, I think I just earned twenty dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki gawks, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d All Might smiles. He leans around to softly ruffle Todoroki\u2019s hair, \u201cI think you should chase your happiness, Young Shouto.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki doesn\u2019t respond. But when they split ways, he\u2019s sure to bow his thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hates when his father comes to visit. The dorm is\u00a0<em>his\u00a0</em>space. His tiny bit of freedom.</p>\n<p>His father stands against the wall, arms folded, and for someone bursting with flames, he always manages to look so cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard about the attack,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Todoroki rolls his eyes, \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d Just a bunch of rag-tag idiots who thought they could take on a band of U.A. seniors. Honestly, it\u2019s dull compared to the shit in their first year.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u00a0<em>know\u00a0</em>it was nothing,\u201d Endeavor rumbles. \u201cSo I want to know why that fool was all over the news, and not you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIida?\u201d Todoroki bristles. \u201cHe took a bullet to the chest protecting one of our friends!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t send you here for nothing,\u201d Endeavor hisses. \u201cYou were already a disappointment at last year\u2019s sports festival.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m interning for rescue missions. I have perfect grades. What more do you want from me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA number one hero doesn\u2019t\u00a0<em>do\u00a0</em>rescue missions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah they do? What-\u201c</p>\n<p>Endeavor goes on a long rant about power and pride and blah blah blah\u00a0<em>nonsense,\u00a0</em>all stuff Todoroki doesn\u2019t care about. It\u2019s all about fighting. About\u00a0<em>being\u00a0</em>number one \u2013 something Todoroki just\u2026doesn\u2019t\u00a0<em>need\u00a0</em>anymore. He zones out halfway through the lecture, and nearly gets smacked for it. Nearly \u2013 he\u2019d like to see Endeavor try.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways,\u201d he huffs, finally preparing to leave. \u201cI want perfect marks at this year\u2019s sports festival.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Todoroki deadpans.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I want you to stop \u2013 stop being\u00a0<em>friends\u00a0</em>with that idiot,\u201d Endeavor barks. \u201cI always see you hovering around him like a child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki bristles, standing up off his desk, \u201cMidoriya?! Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Endeavor\u2019s voice bellows, filling the room with hot smoke. Todoroki feels stuffy, like he can\u2019t breathe \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he really does have a power to rival All Might\u2019s, then that makes him your enemy.\u201d Endeavor takes a step forward, but Todoroki doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time for pointless friendships.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re heroes!\u201d Todoroki yells. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same damn side!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch your tone!\u201d Endeavor\u2019s flames ignite.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might can\u2019t even transform anymore. Why do you care? Why can\u2019t you just let it go<em>?!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI created you, and you will do what I say,\u201d he hovers, threateningly. \u201cAnd you will stay away from that fool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki hasn\u2019t felt like crying in a long time. However, he thinks he could now, if he really tried.</p>\n<p>The river flows slowly beneath him. The bars are slim on the bridge, enough so that he can sit with his legs dangling, arms and chin propped up on the railing. His eyes are unfocused, hair falling in his face. He blows cold air every so often, just to push it out of the way.</p>\n<p>What his father said was typical. Father \u2013 no,\u00a0<em>Endeavor.\u00a0</em>\u00a0Endeavor is no father to him. \u00a0All Might is more of a dad than he ever will be.</p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s still upsetting. Endeavor can yell all he wants \u2013 but\u00a0<em>don\u2019t\u00a0</em>bring Midoriya into this.</p>\n<p>Fuck off.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a breeze that blows by, and the river below ripples. He can hear footsteps approaching on the bridge, and he doesn\u2019t pay them much mind. They sound like boots, clicking against the brick beneath them \u2013 but the clicking stops.</p>\n<p>A body sits next to him, legs sticking out through the bars, and dangling over the edge as well. Todoroki doesn\u2019t have to turn to know it\u2019s Midoriya, but he does anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Midoriya smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya briefly bumps against his shoulder, before swaying back. \u201cI\u2019m assuming it didn\u2019t go very well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya is careful in choosing his words. A breeze passes by.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki exhales harshly, \u201cHe makes me so-\u201c\u00a0 There\u2019s no one around, so Todoroki let\u2019s go of that last wall, \u201c- he makes me so\u00a0<em>fucking\u00a0</em>mad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya hums, and nods for him to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wants me to be perfect, you know,\u201d Todoroki sighs. \u201cI\u2019ve never cared about impressing him, but deep down, I think\u2026I wonder what it\u2019d be like to hear\u00a0<em>well done,\u00a0</em>you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFamily isn\u2019t just blood, you know,\u201d Midoriya says, hand coming to rest on his right thigh. It\u2019s his cold side, but Midoriya\u2019s hand feels hot. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people that are proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki fakes a laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s not about praise. I don\u2019t need recognition. I just want him to leave me alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya frowns, \u201cWhat is he upset about now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Midoriya retracts his hand, and Todoroki misses it instantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can fix, and that makes me sad. You don\u2019t deserve to hear the things he tells you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki feels lighter. He half smiles, the twist in his chest bleeding away.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your worry, Izuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t mean to let his first name slip, but Midoriya turns, with his big puppy eyes, before Todoroki can backpedal.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t be treated that way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Todoroki says honestly. \u201cHe just spews nonsense. Today he said a bunch of garbage about not being your friend anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki can see the exact moment Midoriya\u2019s body curls in on itself, and Todoroki instantly regrets his big fat mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s senile.\u201d Todoroki says quickly, \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what he says.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Midoriya shifts, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get you in trouble with your father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always in trouble with Endeavor.\u201d Todoroki offers a smile, leaning in to get Midoriya\u2019s eye contact back. \u201cFriends can be rivals. He will never understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki has tried to live and learn. He tries to grow, tries not to get too comfortable with life \u2013 because you don\u2019t know it all. You never\u00a0<em>really\u00a0</em>know what might happen next, and Todoroki understands this. Don\u2019t underestimate your enemy, and don\u2019t underestimate life.</p>\n<p>However, out of every possible response Midoriya might\u2019ve had, Todoroki would have never, ever expected him to lean in, and kiss him with an undeniable and purposeful force.</p>\n<p>Todoroki can\u2019t move, can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t close his eyes \u2013 but Midoriya is there, warm lips against his, and Todoroki\u2019s mouth falls open in shock. He\u2019s hot, hot all over \u2013 even his right side burns, tingles from head to toe. Todoroki can see everything \u2013 the length of his eyelashes, the soft curve of his nose -</p>\n<p>Midoriya pulls back suddenly, as if burned, and for a millisecond, Todoroki panics, worried he might\u2019ve\u00a0<em>actually\u00a0</em>burned him, but Midoriya is unharmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he whispers, marked hands hovering over his mouth. \u201cOh my god I\u2019m\u00a0<em>so\u00a0</em>sorry, I-I-\u201c</p>\n<p>Todoroki numbly touches his bottom lip, completely disassociating, as Midoriya spills a million apologies. His face is pink, and his hands are shaking, and he\u2019s so, so cute.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s body moves before his brain, reaching out to pull Midoriya\u2019s wrists away from his face, so he can lean in and kiss him again. In all honesty, Todoroki is impressed by how quickly Midoriya melts into him, sliding forwards and closing his eyes. His hands are still shaking, but Todoroki\u2019s might be too.</p>\n<p>Not to be judgmental, but Todoroki never took him for having much experience, however, Midoriya still kisses well anyways. He does so like everything else in life \u2013 with intensity, and pure determination. Todoroki doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he doesn\u2019t have a plan, but he\u2019s not worried about it. Not right now. Not when he\u2019s thought about this\u00a0<em>so\u00a0</em>much, and never considered it a possibility.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Midoriya still says, against his lips, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Todoroki grits, hand coming up to secure behind Midoriya\u2019s head, and their heads tip, the kiss deepening into something so much sweeter than Todoroki could have ever imagined. He\u2019s honey against him, so warm and cute that Todoroki can\u2019t focus on any one thing.</p>\n<p>They pull back. Todoroki lets out a blow of steam, and Midoriya giggles, covering his pink cheeks with his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cDragon,\u201d Midoriya whispers with a smile, a little embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you kiss me?\u201d Todoroki asks. His heart beats too fast.</p>\n<p>Midoriya swallows. He looks away, then back, lowering his hands as he says, \u201cWhy did you kiss me back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya chews on his bottom lip, and looks back out to the river below them. He grips the bar between his legs, and pulls his legs back from over the edge. \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki can feel himself panicking, even if it\u2019s horribly uncharacteristic for him, but Midoriya is just\u00a0<em>so\u00a0</em>important, he can\u2019t afford to mess this up. Even if it hurts. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Midoriya shouts, and then recoils. \u201cI mean. U-Unless you want to, but, but, I um.\u201d He swallows. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2026I was happy that\u2026that you still wanted to be friends with me, even if it was going against your father\u2019s wishes.\u201d He runs a hand through his unruly hair. Some pieces fall back, and Todoroki resists the urge to brush them behind his ear. Midoriya bashfully smiles, \u201cI guess I\u2019m trying to say that I like you. Uh\u2026 it\u2019s okay if you-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Todoroki slides back away from the edge as well. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been pitifully obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya gasps \u2013 it seems genuine, but Todoroki catches a bit of a cheeky smile, \u201cHave you really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy,\u201d Todoroki smiles, already leaning in to kiss him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Endeavor?\u201d Midoriya asks between kisses, hands playing with Todoroki\u2019s hair so much, that the color is no longer separated in a clean line.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can suck it,\u201d Todoroki says, nosing behind Midoriya\u2019s ear, as he breaks out into giggles. Someone else comes walking along the bridge, and they pull apart respectfully. It\u2019s okay. Midoriya stands, and offers a hand to Todoroki \u2013 and Todoroki takes it, letting Midoriya pull him to his feet, as if he weighs nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their first date is quiet, and pleasant. They\u2019re eighteen, at the peak of their youth, but the idea of loud parties and busy clubs just doesn't sit right with either of them.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an old, old restaurant on the far west side of town \u2013 some place that Midoriya praised to kingdom come. He refuses to tell Todoroki the name. Something about it being a secret.</p>\n<p>They take a train together. Midoriya goes on and on about the first year Class A\u2019s. He\u2019s analyzed them already, the newest book in his bag a recollection of everything he\u2019s studied. Todoroki has always found his studiousness to be both cute, and respectable. Not to mention, Midoriya\u2019s observation skills have saved their asses a handful of times.</p>\n<p>Todoroki listens earnestly as he talks \u2013 but he\u2019s more drawn to the cute little button down Midoriya is wearing. He\u2019s not in dress pants, just jeans, but they look really, really good. He sees Midoriya in skin tight hero suits every day, but there\u2019s something about casual wear that makes Midoriya look especially handsome.\u00a0 He\u2019s changed so much, since their first year. He\u2019s lost most of his baby fat, and his body is all lines of solid muscle. Still, he retains that purity and wholesomeness that drew Todoroki to him in the first place.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late when they arrive at the restaurant. It\u2019s outdoors, tables and chairs perched atop a soft hill. The restaurant owner is an old lady with a firefly quirk. It\u2019s all natural lighting, little lighting bugs huddled under lampshades, as others float through the air. Todoroki has half the mind to question the restaurants sanitation, but he trusts Midoriya\u2019s judgement more.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re seated by a rabbit mutant, and Todoroki is (not) surprised to find that he\u2019s a little nervous.</p>\n<p>However, Midoriya looks up and giggles, \u201cWow, I\u2019m nervous, how weird!\u201d and Todoroki finds himself laughing too.</p>\n<p>He flips open the menu, \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOverly happy, maybe?\u201d Midoriya squirms in his seat to get comfortable. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you agreed to go out with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki snorts, \u201cWhy? Am I that unapproachable?</p>\n<p>\u201cToo hot and\u00a0<em>cool,</em>\u201d Midoriya jokes, and Todoroki softly kicks him from under the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya giggles, and hides his face behind the menu. The waitress comes by to take their order. A firefly lands on Todoroki\u2019s hand, and Todoroki plays with it, watching it lightly hover and glow. He blows a little cold air, and it floats towards Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Midoriya says, \u201cI heard we\u2019re going on another cabin retreat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother training camp, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Midoriya shurgs. \u201cWhether it\u2019s training or not, I think it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki nods, \u201cYeah. I\u2019d like to see you push yourself without holding back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Midoriya sighs. \u201cI need to study old tapes of All Might more. I don\u2019t know how he ever controlled his strength in densely populated areas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how MT Lady does it either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery carefully!\u201d Midoriya laughs. \u201cShe can only enter two laned streets. Her size puts her at a huge advantage during mutant battles, but it\u2019s proven disadvantageous to collateral damage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Todoroki nods. \u201cOur search and rescue internship is almost done. Do you want to do more work with civilians?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure. I think I\u2019d like more hero work. You know, onsite stuff, like what Ochako has been doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrain hard at the camp, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Midoriya grins. \u201cHow\u2019s working with Endeavor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI quit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI learned a lot, honestly.\u201d Todoroki runs his finger along the edge of his glass, lightly frosting the outside. \u201cBut I dunno\u2019. He has a toxic way of thinking, and I don\u2019t want to be like that, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Midoriya blinks, with his big round eyes. \"Besides the obvious.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki shrugs, \u201cPride, and all that. I think the best pro-heros have some kind of humility about them.\u201d He gestures, \u201cLike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya flushes head to toe. He presses a hand to his face, blushing, \u201cWahh, I-ah, I always thought I carried myself with too much pride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Todoroki snorts. \u201cDidn\u2019t you grow up with Bakugou?\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya laughs, his face still red.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh, look what you\u2019ve done.\u201d He picks Todorki\u2019s hand off his glass, \u201cGive me this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki is forced to lean over the table, as Midoriya takes his cold hand and presses it against his cheek to cool it down. Todoroki doesn\u2019t bother hiding a smile \u2013 the few people here are busied with their company, so Todoroki smiles without worry. Midoriya presses his hand to his cheek, then his forehead, before letting go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, he presses a quick kiss to Todoroki\u2019s palm, and it\u2019s Todoroki\u2019s turn to blush hot. His lips are soft.</p>\n<p>Midoriya laughs and laughs, until he bumps his knee against the table, and laughs more. When the waitress isn\u2019t looking, Todoroki blows steam across the table, and Midoriya agrees to stop laughing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since Todoroki stopped interning for his dad, and started working under different pro heroes, he\u2019s been a lot happier. Midoriya applied for the same one as he - and the both made it in. It\u2019s been nothing but small time villains, purse snatchers, bank robbers. But experience is experience, and Todoroki knows that he and Midoriya make a great team, so all is well.</p>\n<p>The biggest mess they\u2019ve encountered so far is an emitter gang they find running around in the inner city. They\u2019ve been hitting up banks, with a few accounts of murder on their ledgers. They all have gun quirks; Todoroki easily dodges through ice, but it\u2019s interesting to watch Midoriya counteract the bullets through speed and strength.</p>\n<p>For a brief moment, Todoroki panics. He\u2019s hit with the overwhelming desire to protect; to pull Midoriya behind him, and keep him away from harm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Midoriya smashes through their fire, the bullets hardly denting the skin that glows red. Midoriya launches one over his shoulder, and propels the other through a wall, and Todoroki realizes he has nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>He shoots fire past Midoriya\u2019s head. Aims ice, and freezes another to the floor. At the end of the day they\u2019re chastised for their carelessness, but praised for their bravery. Midoriya beams under a job well done, and Todoroki slings an arm around his waist when the media comes crawling their way. Midoriya hugs him back.</p>\n<p><em>You two have a wonderful friendship!\u00a0</em>A journalist\u00a0says. Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things have fallen into place at a slow, natural pace, only because their daily lives are so utterly hectic. Todoroki is, however, free to hold and coddle Midoriya as much as he wants. What is Todoroki to say? He\u2019s of a possessive nature.</p>\n<p>Much to Todoroki\u2019s surprise, there\u2019s absolutely zero reaction from their classmates. Not that he wanted one \u2013 he\u2019s\u00a0<em>relieved,\u00a0</em>but rather\u2026concerned. They always make a big deal about who likes who, who slept with who, yadda yadda - but it's almost like Midoriya and Todoroki's relationship is old news.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya sits on his lap in the Class A lounge, reading on his phone, and nobody even blinks.</p>\n<p>Todoroki secures his arms around Midoriya\u2019s waist, peeping over his shoulder to watch and listen. Some students have gone to bed, but most of them lounge around on couches.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuh huh, yuh huh,\u201d Kaminari nods. \u201cI was only passing by in the hallway, but that\u2019s what I heard from the Principal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rouse,\u201d Tokoyami plays with his choker. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way they\u2019d throw us a formal dance without any type of repercussion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have that little faith in our instructors?\u201d Iida blinks. \"The school has done so much for us.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Ashido beams. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s complimentary! We\u00a0<em>have\u00a0</em>been through hell, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely no way,\u201d Kirishima laughs. \u201cEvery single\u00a0<em>\u2018retreat\u2019\u00a0</em>has been a boot camp.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but, what kind of dance?\u201d Ochako blushes. \u201cLike, a prom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari shrugs, \u201cSomething along those lines.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhh,\u201d Mineta slumps back. \u201cThink of all the short dresses \u2013 low cut backs- so many\u00a0<em>boo-\u201c</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSuck a dick, Mineta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Hey! Ow-\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya looks up from his phone, suddenly interested, \u201cWait, there\u2019s a dance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShouto,\u201d Midoriya turns, with a smile. \u201cWe should go together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki shrugs, \u201cI assumed we would.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya beams a blinding smile, and turns back to his phone.</p>\n<p>He tries not to think about Midoriya all dolled up in a suit. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, no fair,\u201d Ochako fake pouts. \u201cYou two already have each other. Who do I ask??\u201d</p>\n<p>Tsuyu gives a nervous\u00a0<em>kero kero\u00a0</em>from the floor, and Todoroki hides his smile in the back of Midoriya\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm!-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno\u2019? Someone from class B?\u201d Kirishima assumes, one hand covering Mineta\u2019s squabbling mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cMnmnm!MnmM!MmmM-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThis sounds fucking dumb,\u201d Bakugou pouts. \u201cWhat a waste of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it sounds fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Kaminari chirps, \u201cWe never get to do anything fun, like, ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuys, it\u2019s a\u00a0<em>trick!\u00a0</em>They\u2019ve never done anything for us out of pure, good heartedness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, for all we know, Gang Orca could bust through the wall again.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a mixed chorus of groans and laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Todoroki begins, and half the heads whip towards him. \u201cIt\u2019s still just a rumor. I don\u2019t know why any of you are stressing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Because.</em>\u201d Ashido stands. \u201cI have to prepare! I need a dress! A date!\u201d</p>\n<p>The AC kicks on in the hallway. Midoriya remains silent in his lap \u2013 until he shudders, and squirms back against Todoroki\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold,\u201d he mumbles. Todoroki hums, and exercises control in warming his left side. Midoriya silently snuggles closer, and Todoroki holds out his warm palm for Midoriya to take. Midoriya whispers a thank you.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey loveshits,\u201d Bakugou snaps. \u201cCan you both stop being disgusting for like, two fucking seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki shoots him a nasty glare over Midoriya\u2019s shoulder, and Bakugou sneers back.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Kirishima elbows Bakugou, \u201cChill!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah man, stop bein\u2019 jealous cause you\u2019re forever alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou explodes, \u201c<em>I\u2019m not fuckin\u2019 jealous! </em><em>Do you see this shit? They\u2019re gross!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Midoriya tries to squirm out of his lap in embarrassment, but Todoroki refuses to let him go. Bakugou is technically,\u00a0<em>technically,\u00a0</em>their friend, (and that\u2019s using the term friend loosely), but Todoroki still gets satisfaction from making him mad.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a homophobe, bro.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m not a fuckin\u2019 homophobe!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tokoyami studies his nails, \u201cNone of us have an issue with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mineta raises a hand, \u201cActually-\u201c but Tsuyu shoves her tongue in his ear, and he squeals away.</p>\n<p>Bakugou is turning red with embarrassment and anger, and Midoriya tries to diffuse to situation, saying, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, no worries, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all as bad as them! God fucking damn, I don\u2019t wanna\u2019 sit n\u2019 watch PDA all night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki taunts, leaning around to press a fat kiss against Midoriya\u2019s cheek. \u201cWatch me kiss my\u00a0<em>boyyyfriennd-</em>\u201c</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s fuse goes off, and he stomps away, fists clenched, face red. Certain parts of his personality have grown in the past two years \u2013 but this part of him remains. He\u2019s less angry, they can tell, but more flustered. Still, Todoroki peppers Midoriya\u2019s cheek in kisses, until Bakugou is out of sight, and Midoriya is giggling in his lap.</p>\n<p>Everyone is laughing on the couches. Kirishima cackles, rocking to his feet with an eventual,\u00a0<em>\u201cAhh, </em>I\u2019ll go get him<em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Midoriya hides his face in his hands. He slides off Todoroki\u2019s lap, and onto the floor, and Todoroki lets him.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill cold?\u201d Ochako teases.</p>\n<p>Midoriya gives a soft, muffled, and gentle\u00a0<em>\u201cNo,\u201d\u00a0</em>from behind his hands, and the group bursts into giggles once more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0This is, perhaps, another upside to the dorms.</p>\n<p>Classes ended hours ago. They worked on homework, and got coffee on the way home. The weather is getting warmer.</p>\n<p>Midoriya cuddles up to his cold side, face pressed into his neck. His breath gives Todoroki chills every so often, but Todoroki doesn\u2019t mind. The blankets are kicked to their feet; Midoriya\u2019s room has slowly changed, from first year, until now. There\u2019s less All Might posters \u2013 granted, there\u2019s still six or seven, but the majority of the wall is covered in photos.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a picture, from that time Midoriya, Todoroki, Iida and Ochako went rollerblading. There\u2019s many more, from class trips and random midnight escapades. Midoriya has a corkboard full of hero notes, with scribbling written across hundreds of pages.</p>\n<p>However, his room maintains a very calm, <em>Midoriya </em>feel, and that\u2019s why Todoroki doesn\u2019t mind hanging out here too much.</p>\n<p>Todoroki can feel Midoridya zoning in and out; it\u2019s fine, Todoroki doesn\u2019t mind the silence. He turns his attention to Midoriya\u2019s crooked, callused hand. His fingers are shorter and stockier than Todoroki\u2019s, but they\u2019re, of course, amazingly strong. It\u2019s been so long since that first sports festival, but Todoroki still feels pangs of guilt every time he sees the scars running across Midoriya\u2019s hand. That might\u2019ve been Midoriya\u2019s doing \u2013 but Midoriya did it <em>for him, </em>and Todoroki will never forget it. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He runs his fingers around Midoriya\u2019s scar. Across his knuckles, and into his palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a matching one, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki pauses, stilling his fingers on Midoriya\u2019s scarred hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Midoriya smiles, wiggling closer and tangling their legs together. \u201cYou still think it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2026it, it technically was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya laughs, \u201cDo you still think you have some kind of <em>hand curse?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya laughs more, squeezing Todoroki\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you have a matching one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA scar.\u201d Midoriya taps his hip. \u201cDid you forget?\u201d</p>\n<p>Honestly, yes.</p>\n<p>It felt like ages ago, but now, Todoroki remembers it clearly. It was a run in with the Villain Association. A mutant was fighting Midoriya to near death, extreme strength matching Midoriya\u2019s kick for kick. Todoroki had his hands full with some lizard ass, who kept trying to spit poison gas at civilians. Neither of them noticed a glass emitter shredding his way towards Midoriya \u2013 and Todoroki\u2019s initial reaction was to jump.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya softly pulls away from Todoroki\u2019s grip. He reaches down to the hem of Todoroki\u2019s shirt and tugs it up to his stomach. There\u2019s a variety of scars on his hip, that stretch down to his thigh. Some small, some large, all from the impact of the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took the hit for me.\u201d Midoriya mumbles. His fingers lightly trace the markings, fingers swirling up and down his side. \u201cI kinda\u2019 wish you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki flares, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have enough scars,\u201d Midoriya frowns. \u201cYou gave me a heart attack, you know. You looked like a pin cushion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki snorts, and slips his arms around Midoriya\u2019s waist, pulling until he\u2019s fully atop him. Midoriya straddles his hips to get comfortable. Todoroki loves the casualness of it all.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you have more scars than I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya shrugs.</p>\n<p>Todoroki softly reaches behind his head, and pulls Midoriya close until they\u2019re kissing. Midoriya\u2019s lips part out of practice, tipping his head so that their noses don\u2019t squish.</p>\n<p>The kiss breaks, and Todoroki says, \u201cI don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya cards his crooked hand through Todoroki\u2019s hair, blending the perfect part of red and white.</p>\n<p>He sticks out his tongue, gesturing with his bad hand, \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki sits up on his elbows to kiss him again. Midoriya presses his face in his hands, and kisses back.</p>\n<p>He loves the slide of Midoriya\u2019s tongue. He loves how his hands can\u2019t stay still \u2013 smoothing from his cheeks, to his neck, to his shoulders. His touch is electric, and Todoroki is sensitive to it all.</p>\n<p>Midoriya pushes, and Todoroki falls back to the bed, Midoriya hovering over him, sucking on his tongue. His breath is hot, and every kiss ties a knot in Todoroki\u2019s stomach. Even his cold side feels hot, from the weight of Midoriya on top of him.</p>\n<p>His thighs are rock solid next to Todoroki's hips, his arms strong braced on the bed \u2013 there\u2019s always too much to look at, and not enough time. Midoriya kisses the corner of his mouth. His cheek, then down his neck, and Todoroki hums, hands pushing at Midoriya\u2019s shirt, until he gets the memo to take it off.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s flip,\u201d Todoroki says. Midoriya nods, and rolls. His shirt lands on the desk across the room.</p>\n<p>He lays down on the pillows, hands making grabby motions towards Todoroki, but Todoroki doesn\u2019t move. He stays on his knees, between Midoriya\u2019s parted thighs, and drags his hands up the muscles of his stomach, worshiping all the skin he can see.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Todoroki slides his hands down, down, until he\u2019s holding his thighs, and squeezing into the muscle. Midoriya\u2019s face turns pink, and he brings a hand to cover his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cH-Hey, don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Todoroki muses. He pulls Midoriya on the bed until the backs of his thighs line up with the tops of Todoroki\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you want to eat me alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d Todoroki says honestly. He leans closer, and Midoriya grabs a handful of Todoroki\u2019s shirt, pulling so they\u2019re kissing again.</p>\n<p>Todoroki needs more time. He needs <em>infinity. </em>He needs the rest of his life to spend kissing Midoriya, until he can map out every inch of him with his tongue, and draw him from memory.</p>\n<p>Midoriya is strong and supple, submissive and always in control. He\u2019s hot against his skin, lips slick and pink and sweet. Midoriya fiddles with the buttons of his shirt, until he\u2019s pushing it down his arms. The fabric gathers around his forearms, but Todoroki is too preoccupied to take it off completely. He\u2019s currently swapping spit with Midoriya, and he tastes too good to stop.</p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s forwardness is always a pleasant surprise. He\u2019s the first to grind up against Todoroki\u2019s hips, denim rubbing against denim. Todoroki takes a sharp inhale through his nose, and Midoriya\u2019s moan is barely audible. Still, Todoroki feels his gut tighten; he\u2019s overcome with the urge to shred all their clothes immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cClothes-\u201c Midoriya starts, but Todoroki is already on it. He sits back enough to help Midoriya out of his jeans, before unzipping \u00a0and kicking off his own.</p>\n<p>His boxer briefs are pink and cute, and a total contrast to the mouthwatering amount of toned muscle Midoriya has.</p>\n<p>Midoriya makes huffy, impatient noises, sitting up and trying to drag Todoroki closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna\u2019 let you stay on top if you\u2019re gonna\u2019 keep leaning away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki laughs, sliding closer once more. He pecks Midoriya\u2019s lips, mumbling <em>sorry, </em>before he dips his fingers beneath the waistband of Midoriya\u2019s underwear, and tugs until it\u2019s below his hips. The fabric pulls taught with his spread thighs, but it\u2019s really sexy.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, wait-\u201c Midoriya flushes.</p>\n<p>Midoriya is downright hard, which is mildly surprising, because they haven\u2019t done much, and they\u2019re not fifteen anymore. They\u2019ve done this a couple times \u2013 and Midoriya\u2019s stamina seems to fluctuate.</p>\n<p>His cock springs to his stomach, and Midoriya hides his face in his hands. Todoroki raises an eyebrow, and wastes no time in wrapping a hand around him. Midoriya keens and bucks in his arms, and Todoroki feels his mouth water.</p>\n<p>\u201cS-Sorry,\u201d Midoriya digs his fingers into Todoroki\u2019s shoulder blades. \u201cI\u2019ve been hard for like, th-the last hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah fuck.</p>\n<p>Todoroki smiles, leaning down until he can press his tongue against his neck, and taste the sweat there. He pumps Midoriya once dryly, humming, \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya pushes and prods, wiggling and squirming around Todoroki until his boxers are pushed down as far as he can reach. Todoroki stretches far above Midoriya to the bedside table, grabbing lotion, and wrapping his slicked fingers around Midoriya\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>Todoroki isn\u2019t fully hard yet, but with the sound Midoriya makes, he might be.</p>\n<p>He leans in to kiss him, one hand braced against the bed. He hushes him, whispering, \u201cWe have to be quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya whines, \u201cI don\u2019t <em>wanna\u2019 </em>be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lips skim his throat. Midoriya\u2019s back arches off the bed to reach. Todoroki bites into his cheek, and squeezes harder around Midoriya's cock. Fingers dig into his back, and Todoroki wonders, in the back of his mind, how amazing it\u2019d be if they could just <em>let go. </em></p>\n<p>Still, Todoroki\u2019s head is swimming. Midoriya aligns their hips and grinds, and Todoroki\u2019s eyes roll into the back of his head.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s rushed and messy, maybe. There\u2019s not any district rhyme or reason to what they do, other than the innate desire to be closer, <em>closer closer- </em></p>\n<p>He kisses Midoriya until he can\u2019t breathe, and then kisses him more. He skims his slicked hand down Midoriya\u2019s body, grinds harder until his chest might explode. Midoriya pours noises down his throat. Tugs on his hair. Whines and squirms and bucks until their cocks are rubbing together perfectly. Midoriya chants his name above a whisper, and every syllable sparks down Todoroki like a tripwire, until Midoriya is coming between them. Damn, he\u2019s a work of art, all choked whines from bitten red lips. Every sound drags down Todoroki like lava.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki doesn\u2019t have any time to get his bearings. Midoriya flips them, pressing Todoroki into the mattress with strength. Todoroki feels winded from the action alone, Midoriya\u2019s eyes hot, his body tacky.</p>\n<p>Todoroki breathes hot steam, and Midoriya grins something evil, hands pressing into Todoroki\u2019s thighs. His lips skim down his chest, teeth running down his hip, until sticky lips wrap around his cock. Todoroki makes a hard noise in the back of his throat, and counts to ten to avoid setting the bed on fire. His mouth is wet and hot and Todoroki is close already, a hard twist winding closer in his gut. Midoriya takes it at his own pace, tongue squirming, setting no distinct rhythm, and it drives Todoroki <em>batshit crazy. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAh- <em>Izuku, </em>careful-\u201c</p>\n<p>He pops off, breathless and flushed, smiling despite his rustled appearance, and Todoroki almost comes. He beams, leaning over to nip Todoroki\u2019s hip, \u201cI <em>am </em>careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki is too dizzy \u2013 but suddenly Midoriya is kissing him again, and a slicked hand is pumping him at a steady pace, and Todoroki comes hard. He pulls too hard on Midoriya\u2019s hair, but Midoriya doesn\u2019t flinch. His lips curl into a smile against Todoroki\u2019s, fingers calloused and <em>real. </em></p>\n<p>They\u2019ve made a real mess. Todoroki feels tingly and ethereal, almost like he could phase through the bed, and into the floor.</p>\n<p>Midoriya kisses him for a long, long time, and Todoroki kisses back. Midoriya is mumbling against his lips \u2013 all words that don\u2019t make sense \u2013 but Todoroki doesn\u2019t mind. Every sound is a gift, until they have enough energy to go again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya stands off to the side, wiping his sweaty palms on his suit pants. He immediately regrets it, panicking as to check for a stain \u2013 but it seems fine, so he breathes a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>He was initially nervous for tonight. Well, he\u2019d get nervous for any date with Todoroki \u2013 but this is U.A.\u2019s <em>prom, </em>and Midoriya wanted to look nice.</p>\n<p>However, when Todoroki comes by his dorm that evening, he looks at Midoriya as if he\u2019s the <em>world, </em>so Midoriya\u2019s nerves ebb away.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s loud here; the school put real work into this prom thing. There\u2019s students from every grade \u2013 balloons and lights and streamers. Present Mic is completely enveloped with his DJ booth. There\u2019s a decent number of students out on the dance floor, some of which Midoriya recognizes</p>\n<p>Todoroki comes his way with a drink in hand, and Midoriya takes it with a thank you.</p>\n<p>As expected, Todoroki looks great in a three-piece suit. Midoriya doesn\u2019t have the best vocabulary to describe it \u2013 handsome? Cute? Delectable, honestly. It\u2019s tailored to him, the vest fitting the narrow circumference of his waist. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a sip to distract himself, \u201cYou didn\u2019t want anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki stares. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya takes another sip, before he furrows his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think someone might\u2019ve spiked the punch,\u201d Midoriya sips. He offers his cup to Todoroki, who takes a sip as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. I think that\u2019s vodka.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya takes the cup back, and swallows it all down in one shot. It breaks a laugh out of Todoroki. His laugh is so damn cute.</p>\n<p>He smiles, \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just expecting the inevitable,\u201d Midoriya beams, setting down his empty cup. Todoroki wraps an arm around Midoriya\u2019s waist, pulling him closer when someone comes staggering past them.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a <em>horde </em>of dateless girls checking Todoroki out \u2013 because let\u2019s be honest, time has done Todoroki so, so well. He was always handsome, in Midoriya\u2019s opinion, but by their third year he\u2019s grown taller and stronger and goddamn, way hotter. He\u2019s softened up too, and Midoriya appreciates that. Bakugou says it\u2019s a bad thing, but Midoriya disagrees.</p>\n<p>He doesn't mind the girls. Midoriya is the one who has Todoroki tied to his hip, not them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you want to dance?\u201d Midoriya looks up.</p>\n<p>Todoroki shrugs, \u201cNot particularly. Unless you wanted to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, me neither,\u201d Midroiya leans into his side. \u201cYou look good, by the way. Did I tell you that? You look good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki snorts, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Your legs look fifty miles long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look nice too,\u201d Todoroki pats his hip. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom sent it to me,\u201d Midoriya laughs. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do too bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mom is fucking talented.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya breaks out laughing. He takes a pause to talk, but Todoroki starts laughing instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Todoroki nudges him, \u201cCheck out the Jackson 5 out there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sero and Kaminari are tearing up the dance floor. Hilariously enough, they\u2019re pretty good. Midoriya starts laughing too.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an explosion.</p>\n<p>A huge gust of hot wind blows through the gym. Todoroki throws a protective arm over Midoriya, as the wall to the gym explodes and crumbles. Students scream as some are knocked back from the blast. Todoroki builds a wall of ice to keep them both from flying, and Midoriya plants his feet into the ground.</p>\n<p>The lights of the gym flicker.</p>\n<p>Gang Orca crawls out of the ruble, teeth and spit snarling.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an ambush!\u201d He raises his arms, where there\u2019s obvious handicaps, \u201cThink fast!\u201d</p>\n<p>He has an army of teachers and pro heroes behind him. The first years panic \u2013 but the third years sigh, if anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Midoriya brushes soot out of his hair. \u201cI owe Tokoyami fifteen bucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya sheds his suit jacket \u2013 and by the time he looks back, Todoroki is doing the same.</p>\n<p>Present Mic\u2019s voice comes over the speakers.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAttacks can happen anywhere, anytime! Make do with what you\u2019ve got! This is a graded assignment- go!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Todoroki rolls up his sleeves, looking sexy as hell. Midoriya grins, \u201cWanna\u2019 gather class A?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aoyama\u2019s navel lazer beams from the middle of the crowd, like a bat signal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Todoroki huffs a laugh, igniting fire along his left side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
