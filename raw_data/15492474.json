  "summary": "<p>6 months after the Avengers Civil War the Rogue Avengers have been pardoned and are back at the compound. They didn't expect to see Tony had already recruited a whole new team.</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Tony Stark didn't want the Rogues back however with threat on the horizon he, sadly, needed them. But just because they're back doesn't mean he has to be happy about it. </p>\n<p>or </p>\n<p>The Rogues are back, Tony doesn't care for them anymore but Stephen Strange and Tony Stark have a surprising amount in common.</p>\n<p>A meeting and Training.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>My first attempt at IronStrange. Please don't murder me if it's bad...<br>This chapter doesn't have any huge plot thing or whatever just the return of the Rogues. It will get more interesting (and more IronStrangey) as time wears on.<br>:)</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for all the kudos and comments :) this story is getting much more popularity than I expected so here's another chapter:))))))</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>What did you think of how I wrote for Carol so far?

Mostly since I wanted to give you guys some more before going to bed. The joys of waking up to your awesome comments in the morning. :)</p>\n<p>A couple of things that I'm not sure I made clear:<br>-Hope and Tony were childhood friends before their dads fell out and then they still were after but didn't see one another as often.<br>-Ragnarok happened completely the same as the movie but Thanos wasn't there at the end instead he was attacking Xandar.<br>-All of the New Avengers know about Siberia and Tony's Panic attack's/anxiety/PTSD/medication<br>-Tony was way more injured than he was in the MCU and actually in a coma for a couple of weeks which is part of the reason the New Avengers aren't that welcoming to the Rogues.<br>-The other reason is just that they don't really like them because of the Civil War fiasco</p>\n<p>Alright, enjoy the chapter!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>ARGH the IRONSTRANGE is too ADORABLE!<br>I love them so much *wipes away tear*</p>\n<p>That joke Harley made is their new 'connected' joke so expect it to crop up more often :)))<br>Don't worry fellow IronStrange shippers, there will be some fluff soon</p>\n<p>Please comment what you thought or if you have any questions/suggestions/general ideas and expect a new chapter most likely tomorrow! <br>:D</p>\n<p>You guys are the BEST!

You guy's awesomeness is what got me to write this all so fast :))))<br>and the next chapter has more IronStrange fluffiness...

  "text": "<p>\n<span>Stephen watched Tony work over the top of his book. He was comfortably positioned on a sofa in the main lab in the Avengers Compound. As per usual Tony was working his ass off at a table nearby. Since Stephen had joined the New Avengers, kind of after all he still had his duties as sorcerer supreme but he helped out and joined in for the exercises, but he wasn\u2019t really a member, Tony and he had become close friends. It had started with just the occasional meeting at the compound, then joining in on game nights, then hanging out together outside of the exercises, then, little by little, they had opened up to each other. It was refreshing to have someone to talk to about science considering that wasn\u2019t exactly Wong\u2019s forte. To talk to someone who had also experienced pain the way Stephen had. Chronic pain wasn\u2019t exactly a common talking point among many. But Tony understood Stephen and Stephen understood Tony. When the magic world was having a quiet day Stephen would portal to the lab and he and Tony would just enjoy one another\u2019s company. Maybe Stephen was enjoying it a little more than he should but that didn\u2019t matter. Stephen checked the time. The Rogue Avengers would be arriving in 30 minutes, fully pardoned in all their assholey glory, Stephen was fantasising about giving Rogers the shit he deserved. But alas, he couldn\u2019t, not in the way he wanted to anyway. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s almost time Tony.\u201d Said Stephen softly. Tony froze at the words for a full second before continuing his work.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t required that any of us meet them so I guess everything is fine.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was strained and Stephen could sense the panic building in the man. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Several more minutes passed in silence before Tony spoke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure the implant will work?\u201d He turned to face Stephen, fingers gently tapping the Arc Reactor. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of that witch in my mind, and having that out of the way will be a relief.\u201d Stephen stood up, placed his book down on the cushion and moved over to the brunet. He narrowed his eyes slightly as a slightly shaky finger gently ran itself along the small, healing incision on Tony\u2019s head. At the contact, Tony stiffened but slowly relaxed into the touch, as he normally did. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt should be fine, I did enchant it myself you know.\u201d Stephen smiled, sliding his hands into the pockets of his jacket. \u201cBesides as manager of all magic on Earth, I do have the option to limit her powers.\u201d At the mention of magic, Tony rolled his eyes fondly, lip twitching slightly. This was their relationship, teasing, banter, silence, teasing, bragging, music, more teasing, and talking. There were soft footsteps down the flight of stairs leading to the lab, Tony turned startled at the sound, he then relaxed though at the sight of Hope entering the lab. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Tony, Stephen.\u201d She walked to where they were now standing. Leaning on the table littered with tools she continued. \u201cSadly, the </span>\n<em>\n<span>others </span>\n</em>\n<span>will be arriving shortly. The council thought at least one of us should meet with them as a show of good faith.\u201d She snorted sceptically. \u201cAs if any </span>\n<em>\n<span>good faith </span>\n</em>\n<span>existed at this point. But since none of us is stupid I thought I should meet with them considering Carol is out with Rhodes doing god knows what, we don\u2019t exactly want the kids near them alone, Thor, Bruce, and Loki are dealing with Asgardians which is understandable considering their recent arrival, and sorry Stephen but I\u2019m probably the least likely to tear them limb from limb out of the two of us.\u201d She sighed adding \u201cI haven\u2019t ruled it out though\u201d under her breath. Tony nodded along, obviously grateful at the kindness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill Vision be meeting them with you?\u201d Tony asked, failing miserably at any attempt he was making to keep his voice calm. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe was indifferent so I guess he may or may not show up.\u201d Hope shrugged. \u201cHonestly, I think they should be grateful anyone is greeting them at all.\u201d Tony smiled slightly at that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Boss, they are here.\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY said bitterly. Tony made an odd choking noise but Stephen took his hand and smiled comfortingly at him, which luckily seemed to calm Tony down slightly. Hope stood sighing,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll go meet them then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hope walked stiffly up the stairs to the elevator, she really didn\u2019t want to do this but no way was she making Tony greet those ungrateful bastards and Scott. To be honest, Hope had no idea how she felt about Scott, but that didn\u2019t matter, there were more important Captain America shaped issues to deal with. Hope stood in front of the closed door to the main common area, she could already hear the voices on the other side, muffled by the walls. Hope sighed and put on an indifferent mask that she had gotten from being the daughter of Hank Pym and nodded to FRIDAY to open the door. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Entering, all the conversation stopped, and she ignored the shocked look Scott was giving her, wide eyes, jaw hanging open, the whole lot, and stared icily at the group.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello, we were expecting Tony.\u201d Said the oh so punchable face of Captain America. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony was unable to meet you today due to\u2026 recent personal issues.\u201d That drew a snort from half the group, but Rogers looked slightly worried, which only infuriated Hope more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is it? Is he okay?\u201d Hope\u2019s jaw stiffened at the words from the super soldier. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat isn\u2019t your business considering it is a </span>\n<em>\n<span>personal </span>\n</em>\n<span>issue.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo Stark is just being the usual asshole.\u201d Hissed one of the group. Before Hope could retort Scott muttered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut it, Clint.\u201d To the offender. Scott was doing a cycle of staring at the floor, at her, and then at the floor again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo anyway.\u201d Said Rogers hurriedly, \u201cI am Steve Rogers, that\u2019s Clint Barton, Wanda Maximoff, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Scott Lang.\u201d Hope raised an eyebrow slightly, not even looking at his outstretched hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Unfortunately, </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201cHope Van Dyne,\u201d she introduced. At the remark, Rogers looked slightly surprised. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow could you know?\u201d He\u2019s asked, Hope had to hold back an eye roll.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell obviously it couldn\u2019t be because you\u2019re all famous, and my father made Scott his suit.\u201d That first made Rogers redden and then look even more shocked. \u201cWell unless you want to be perfectly honest and say that Scott stole the suit from my father causing an extensive investigation into whether or not we were, or had contact with, known terrorists.\u201d The expression on their faces was almost amusing, a mix of both shock and outrage at the terrorist comment. Hope almost smiled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHope, I am so, so, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\u201d Scott said looking horrified.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure you didn\u2019t.\u201d She said crisply. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere goes Stark, ruining even more people\u2019s lives with his whole intent to break down the Avengers.\u201d Muttered Wanda. Hope rounded on her fury in her eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, it definitely wasn\u2019t your fault for recruiting Scott and making him steal the suit in the first place.\u201d She said sarcastically. \u201cFor your information, it is because of Tony that my father and I aren\u2019t still on the run considering his frankly alarming defence of us especially considering he had only woken up from the state </span>\n<em>\n<span>you </span>\n</em>\n<span>left him in two days prior.\u201d Hope breathed deeply, collecting herself and ignoring the stunned silence from her outburst. \u201cBut I guess that\u2019s what real friends do for each other.\u201d She finished sweetly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d sputtered Rogers. Luckily at that moment, Vision walked in. At the sight of the group his face quickly turned expressionless. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cViz?\u201d Smiled Wanda starting to move forwards towards him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMiss Maximoff.\u201d He replied curtly before going to stand next to Hope. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlmost done\u201d Hope sighed running a hand through her dark hair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould you like me to finish for you?\u201d Asked Vision, almost completely ignoring the Rogues.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Viz.\u201d Hope smiled. Visions smiled slightly back before turning to the others.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDue to relatively recent damage to multiple floors in the Compound.\u201d Wanda winced at that, still obviously heartbroken at the cold shoulder. \u201cYour new rooms are located on the East Wing, you are all prohibited from the West Wing lacking invitation, where the other Avengers are staying.\u201d Vision continued interrupting whatever tirade was about to happen as Clint opened his mouth furiously, \u201cFRIDAY is no longer available to you upon your beck and call. Only the people whitelisted are allowed to communicate freely with her and none of you is on that list.\u201d Rogers interrupted at that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut what if we want to talk to one of you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you wish to communicate with the Avengers individually you may message them via your StarkPhones which are awaiting you in your rooms. Response may not occur though.\u201d Most of them, minus Scott who was still following the cycle of looking at the floor then at Hope, looked outraged at that. Any meeting\u2019s or training sessions will be communicated via your StarkPhones as well. All are required and not showing up without council approved absence will mean instant termination of your probationary period. Your rooms are that way.\u201d Vision pointed down a hall. Then without another word to the Rogues, they headed back through the door to the West Wing, leaving silence behind them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell that went well,\u201d said Clint sarcastically. Steve turned to the others a shocked expression still on his face. He saw most of them looked either awkward or angry. Scott was staring at the door Hope and Vision had left through with an odd expression on his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho does Stark think he is?\u201d growled Wanda, hands glowing slightly. She looked hurt and angry. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just Stark\u2019s influence making Vision act that way.\u201d comforted Clint. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut he\u2019s keeping us out of half the compound!\u201d she hissed at the group.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s the owner of the Avengers Initiative and well the most important person in the world.\u201d sighed Sam tiredly. Steve sighed too, then placed his bag by the door and sat at the counter by the kitchen. The others followed behind except for Natasha who went and stood on the other side of the counter. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s playing the long game, Stark is just hiding and sulking, waiting for us to beg his forgiveness.\u201d Clint muttered, \u201clike that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut Hope said it was a personal problem,\u201d said Scott uncertainty. \u201cI know her and she wouldn\u2019t lie. Well, she might\u2019ve once but most of the time she wouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d Sam snorted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo offence man but she didn\u2019t seem overjoyed by the sight of you.\u201d Scott looked down again and then back at the door. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell this place looks not that different,\u201d said Steve in a feeble attempt to change the subject. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcept it does. Tasha, I\u2019m starved can you check the cupboards?\u201d Clint groaned, rubbing his face with his hands. Natasha turned and began to rifle through the cupboards. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s not much except coffee, more coffee, even more, coffee, some crackers, pop tarts and whatever\u2019s in this bo-\u201d she suddenly froze as she opened the box.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Wanda now intrigued.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing,\u201d Natasha replied, calmly placing the box back into the cupboard. Clint moved quickly next to her and grabbed the box.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClint, we really shouldn\u2019t\u201d she hissed but Clint ignored her bringing the box back to the counter. Opening it the group all looked inside. Steve furrowed his brow, inside was a lot of cylindrical, orange box\u2019s. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of pills,\u201d said Sam picking up an orange box. \u201cDoesn\u2019t have a name.\u201d he pulled the box towards him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat kind are they?\u201d asked Steve a sick feeling in his stomach.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGuys this doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea\u2026\u201d said Scott standing up and taking a cautious step back. He glanced at Natasha who was leaning against the cupboards looking wary.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, there are some anti-depressants, anxiety meds, pain meds, and barely touched bottles of pills for insomnia.\u201d At the end of Sam\u2019s explanation, Clint gave a long whistle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of drugs, I wonder who they\u2019re for.\u201d He looked at Natasha. \u201cYou know don\u2019t you.\u201d she didn\u2019t respond and Clint continued to rummage through the box. He looked back up at Natasha and was about to say something when a glowing orange circle appeared in the room and a man stepped out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Boss, you need to take your medication.\u2019 </b>\n<span>informed FRIDAY. Tony groaned and turned his chair again. Stephen looked back up from his book. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere are they,\u201d Tony grumbled ignoring the amused look Stephen was giving him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Yeah about that\u2026\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY began, </span>\n<b>\u2018they are in the main common area.\u2019</b>\n<span> Tony froze.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd?\u201d he whispered. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018The Rogues have not vacated the area.\u2019</b>\n<span> Tony groaned, even more, breathing getting a bit faster at the point that FRIDAY was making. Stephen looked at him and Tony was surprised to say the man was smiling slightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I get them?\u201d he asked, \u201cI would love to freak them out completely by just portalling in there full wizard.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t help grinning at the idea.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are amazing.\u201d Tony sighed smiling. \u201cFRIDAY, make sure to get a picture of their reaction.\u201d Stephen snickered and stood up. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you think the cloak would be a bit much?\u201d Stephen questioned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe,\u201d replied Tony. \u201cWe can freak them out with the cape another time.\u201d at the despised word Stephen grimaced.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a cloak, Tony.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhatever you say Gandalf.\u201d Stephen smiled rolling his eyes then portalled out of the room to the Sanctum to get wizarded up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Stephen stepped through the portal to the common room, an overly serious expression on his face he almost burst out laughing at the expression on the Rogues face as they saw him and got all defensive. Then Stephen noticed the box they had been looking at and his expression darkened. Without a word, he strode up, grabbed the box and pulled one of the pillboxes out of Wilson\u2019s hand and ignored the words being shouted his way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t take that it\u2019s not yours!\u201d Stephen just had to stop at the absurd words said by Rogers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s rich coming from you,\u201d Stephen replied with a calm anger. He didn\u2019t even have to turn to sense the knife thrown in his direction. With a quick motion, the dagger was flung through a portal into deep space. He turned back to them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously?\u201d He sighed as he saw the motion made by the witch. He was going to enjoy this. The red magic swarmed towards him and he flicked it away with a small motion. The look on their faces at this was laughable. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d he asked sounding bored.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho the hell are you.\u201d hissed the witch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomeone more powerful than you Miss Maximoff so I recommend you stop before I have to limit your powers.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy on earth would you be able to do that!\u201d Clint growled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell it\u2019s my job.\u201d he turned back around and left through the portal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Back in the lab, Stephen burst out laughing. Tony looked at him surprised. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked as Stephen handed him the box still chuckling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was so\u2026 enjoyable.\u201d he grinned at Tony. \u201cThey almost had heart attacks when I appeared from nowhere. Then when they attempted to attack me and I just brushed off the witch\u2019s magic they looked ready to die then and there.\u201d Tony snorted at that opening the box and swallowing the required pills. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow long do you think I could stay down here before they go on a rampage?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSadly only a couple of days.\u201d Stephen sighed sitting down next to him before realising he was still in his dark blue robes. He stood back up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will be right back,\u201d he said opening a portal back to his room in the sanctum. \u201cI just need to change.\u201d Tony mock pouted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShame, you look so good in robes.\u201d he jumped up and leaned against Stephen. \u201cIt\u2019s very sexy.\u201d Stephen reddened looking at the man unamused. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll just pretend it\u2019s the drugs saying that.\u201d but he couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face. Tony sighed dramatically collapsing onto the sofa.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou wound me.\u201d Stephen rolled his eyes smirking at the man before heading back into his room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was several days after that Steve and the others even saw proof that Tony was in the compound. They were all milling around the main common area. Steve and Sam talking at a coffee table, Clint whispering with Wanda, a dark expression on his face, Natasha standing and staring out a window, Scott was just sitting in a chair looking depressed. At the sound of a couple of pairs of footsteps Steve looked at the hallway. Laughter and talking was growing louder by the second and grabbing most of the rooms attention. Steve had just stood up expectantly when two teenagers came walking through the hall. At the sight of them the younger one\u2019s face darkened and the older looked horrified. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi,\u201d said Steve kindly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your names.\u201d there was silence was a beat before the younger one answered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat, is none of your business.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to offend you, he was just being nice.\u201d Wanda smiled slightly at the boys, leaning on the kitchen\u2019s counter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat must be a stretch for you.\u201d snorted the boy, the older boy nudged him, gesturing towards the door to the forbidden West Wing. The boy nodded and they began to continue walking. Steve didn\u2019t want the conversation to end, this was a chance for information from someone that might know what was happening. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy name is Steve,\u201d he stated awaiting an answer from the younger boy who had stopped at the words. The older boy tugged him, apparently not wanting to talk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHonestly Rogers, I don\u2019t care.\u201d The boy replied simply turning back to face him. \u201cI don\u2019t especially want to know you so whatever you\u2019re trying to start between us? It isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d Steve opened his mouth to reply but then closed it again the boys began to walk again but Wanda glided next to the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you part of the Avengers?\u201d she asked sidetracking them. The older boy pursed his lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony won\u2019t let us join officially until we\u2019re trained and older.\u201d The younger said stiffly, not looking at Wanda. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell at least he can get that right.\u201d snorted Clint. That seemed to be enough for the older boy who finally opened his mouth to speak.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAt least he\u2019s done more right than you.\u201d That left them in silence. Natasha, who had been ignoring the conversation, looked at the boy, a puzzled expression ghosting on her face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell looks like they\u2019re already corrupted.\u201d sighed Clint dramatically. Scott was still seated, shaking his head slightly as if in a daze. All of a sudden the door to the West Wing opened and the man in question stepped in front of the boys and between Wanda.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony,\u201d said Steve stepping forward, a hopeful expression on his face. Finally they could get some answers and sort this stupid situation out. Tony ignored him, instead staring down Wanda. After Wanda snorted and turning away, Tony turned to the kids, checking them over with his eyes. After the inspection a look of relief graced his features. That\u2019s when Steve noticed the glowing light, that was all too familiar, on his chest. He paled ever so slightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou replaced the Arc?\u201d he questioned surprised. Tony froze at the question and the younger kid shot Steve a dirty look. Tony nodded stiffly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCould we talk?\u201d Steve tried hopefully. The younger kid glared at Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming anywhere near him.\u201d he growled. Tony sighed giving the kid a look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHarley, it\u2019s fine.\u201d the newly dubbed \u2018Harley\u2019 gave Tony an incredulous look. The older kid made a disbelieving noise and Tony rolled his eyes at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere\u2019s the shield?\u201d asked Sam at an obvious attempt at conversation but dread instantly filled Steve, considering their last meeting and Tony\u2019s wince at the mention of it now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike you\u2019d get that back.\u201d said the older kid also glaring at them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDidn\u2019t T\u2019challa make you new shields while you were in Wakanda?\u201d Tony asked still not looking at them, he rubbed his chest, near the glow of the new Arc Reactor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou knew where we were?\u201d asked Sam surprised. Tony hummed in answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe was really bad at hiding it, especially when I was there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were in Wakanda.\u201d Wanda sounded disbelieving, \u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPicking up some stuff.\u201d Tony replied mysteriously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVibranium?\u201d Natasha offered, Steve noticed Tony had begun to drum his fingers nervously on the Arc, his silence was Natasha\u2019s answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that what you did with Cap\u2019s shield?\u201d Clint hissed, \u201cturned it into one of your little creations?\u201d Harley and the other kid, kept on glancing at each other nervously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClint it\u2019s fine.\u201d Steve almost ordered. Tony made a great effort in rolling his eyes before turning back to the kids and ignoring Steve again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you guys want to work this weekend? Or is it another movie marathon.\u201d Tony was saying as he led the kids away to the ever-closed door. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony wait.\u201d Steve began to say but Tony had already brought the kids through the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As soon as the door closed behind them, Peter turned to Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you alright Mr Stark?\u201d he asked nervously. Tony sighed, breathing deeply. He wouldn\u2019t lose it again, not in front of the kids. Tony lent his arms against the wall rubbing his chest. The pain was jumping up by the numbers as he began to panic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Tony, you\u2019re okay.\u201d soothed Harley, but he kept on glaring at the door. Tony sighed again straightening before looking at the two kids. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry I forgot to tell you </span>\n<em>\n<span>they </span>\n</em>\n<span>were back.\u201d Peter looked at him concerned. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Mr Stark-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony.\u201d Tony interrupted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay </span>\n<em>\n<span>Tony</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Peter said again, obviously holding back an eye roll. \u201cIt\u2019s not us you should be concerned about.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, but it is.\u201d Tony replied as they began to walk down to the lab. \u201cDo you not remember our little chat?\u201d Peter did roll his eyes this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is different.\u201d he pointed out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d Tony snorted, \u201cSo, are you guys wanting to come to the meeting on wednesday or not.\u201d Harley sighed at the obvious change in subject.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, yes?\u201d Peter said uncertainty in his voice. \u201cAunt May said I could come anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd remember, you don\u2019t have to reveal yourself as the spiderling if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Tony recited, Peter nodded, irritated by the change in subject.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh Tony, I forgot to tell you.\u201d Harley began excitement now in his tone. \u201cMy mum said I could stay with you during school break so that\u2019s until the end of next week.\u201d Tony grinned at him, joy written on his features.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell I guess we\u2019ll have a lot of work to do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have more time to practice in my armour\u201d Harley added. Tony smirked at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Entering the lab Tony saw Stephen once again was on the sofa, under a blanket, looking quite frankly incredibly adorable, especially with the effect of the blanket which for some reason was incredibly fluffy, reading a different book this time though, one that was bigger and dustier. Tony could practically smell the rotting pages from the door.. At their entrance, Stephen looked up smiling at the kids and giving Tony a concerned look, that clearly indicated, </span>\n<em>\n<span>are you okay?, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Tony smirked at him and winked. Maybe Stephen was right about the drug thing. He was definitely more flirtatious than usual. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you kids can do whatever you want I need to rest for a while.\u201d Peter looked slightly put out. \u201cWe can watch something after if you want. Your choice.\u201d That seemed to satisfy Peter and he grinned at Tony before he ran off with Harley to the adjoining room made to test armour. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Stephen asked sounding concerned as he turned the page of his book. Tony sighed before sitting on the couch beside Stephen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen have I ever been?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFair point.\u201d Stephen looked over the top of his book at him. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d Tony was silent for several seconds before he lent back in the couch and replied.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t even look at them without freaking out. How on earth can we work together?\u201d Stephen thought for 89 milliseconds before answering.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to most of the time. You are on a different field team than them so\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat my friend is the sucky part of being a hero. Putting everyone else\u2019s needs before your own.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomething Rogers definitely doesn\u2019t get.\u201d Stephen smiled grimly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Boss, Dr Banner is here.\u2019 </b>\n<span>informed FRIDAY. Tony grinned. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs he on his way down?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Yes, Boss.\u2019 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The door opened and Bruce came in. Tony jumped to his feet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbout time you got here. You\u2019ve been so busy I didn\u2019t even get to reunite with my science bro!\u201d Tony put an arm around a smiling Bruce\u2019s shoulder\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry about that Tony, things have been crazy with the Asgardians and I thought it would be a tad mean to abandon Thor with all the work.\u201d Tony nodded leading him towards the sofa.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnderstandable. Now\u2026\u201d Tony grinned again. \u201cScience Bro, meet Awesome Facial Hair Bro!\u201d Stephen raised an eyebrow in amusement as he stood up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Bruce.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStephen Strange.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike the neurosurgeon?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEx-neurosurgeon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow Stephen\u2019s a fancy wizard.\u201d grinned Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaster of the Mystic Arts.\u201d Stephen automatically corrected. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got it Dumbledore.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI never thought you would be so supportive of magic Tony.\u201d teased Stephen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m supportive of a lot of things,\u201d he replied wiggling his eyebrows. Stephen scoffed and looked away amused. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d said Bruce slightly confused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, Brucie Bear!\u201d Tony smirked. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been all these years?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpace. As Hulk. Fighting as a Gladiator for some reason.\u201d Tony raised his eyebrows.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay. That wasn\u2019t exactly what I was expecting but I\u2019ll roll with it.\u201d They sat down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone else upstairs except Vision. Where is everyone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbout time they got into their own wing,\u201d muttered Stephen darkly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cum What?\u201d asked Bruce confused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLong story short. After you left the Avengers fell apart. Rogers and his little band of misfits ran off and became wanted worldwide. Then since I am so nice I, with the help of T\u2019challa, who is the king of Wakanda, got them pardoned and now they\u2019re back.\u201d Tony said quickly. Bruce gaped for a second.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo\u2026 terrorists?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cJeez Tony.\u201d Bruce rubbed his face with his hands. \u201cHow the hell did they manage that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d He began to tick off on his fingers. Bruce seemed to notice his slightly shaking left hand. \u201c1.) Rogers had a whole car chase with Barnes and destroyed several cars in the process then got arrested. 2.) He broke out of custody. 3.) He and his crew trashed a German Airport when I was trying to bring them in by the order of the government. 4.) Rogers and his pal Barnes almost killed me and left me to die in Siberia.\u201d as Tony said number four his voice shook and Stephen and Bruce\u2019sfists clenched. \u201c5.) they broke into a high-security prison to break the captured members of the band of misfits out. That\u2019s basically the jist of it.\u201d By the end of the explanation, Bruce looked like he was about stand up and go give Rogers a piece of his mind. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2026 Asshole.\u201d Bruce finally sputtered. \u201cI mean god, Tony? How can you stand to be in the same room as them even?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTo be honest I can\u2019t,\u201d Tony replied simply. \u201cIn other news, I have a new team of people who are actually nice. You\u2019ll like them.\u201d Bruce gaped at him, silence filled the room for several more seconds before Bruce spoke again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you had a new Arc Reactor?\u201d the implication Bruce was making was clear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Brucie Bear, this one isn\u2019t to stop me dying it\u2019s got my suit in it.\u201d Tony grinned, his hand was still shaking so he rubbed it. \u201cNanotech, it\u2019s pretty awesome but you\u2019ll have to wait until the next training session for the big reveal.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDrama Queen.\u201d snorted Stephen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, wow,\u201d said Bruce still shocked at all this news.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Tony?\u201d came the voice of Harley as he entered the room, at the sight of the new arrival he grinned in excitement.\u201dPeter get in here. Dr Banner\u2019s here.\u201d Peter entered the room fanboyish joy clear on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah you have a bit of a fan club.\u201d smiled Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t listen to the conversation happening between the others as they headed to the main common area or dinner he was too busy thinking about how to fix the Tony problem. He did, however, notice when they stopped talking and as he was pulled back to reality he heard several voices talking and laughing. He continued to walk into the room and saw grouped together on the sofas surrounding the coffee table, Tony, Rhodey, Bruce, Vision, Hope, Harley, the other kid, Some blond woman, and\u2026 and\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou,\u201d said Clint surprised. The groups talking stopped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes me\u2026\u201d replied the wizard from the other day. Steve noticed how the man was sitting quite close to Tony. Maybe it was his mind playing tricks on him but his dislike for the man deepened.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s Chinese over there if you want some.\u201d said the blond woman professionally. Steve slowly walked towards the pile of boxes on the counter. The rest of his team followed him, Scott lingering for a second and looking at Hope before following, throwing looks at the group had begun talking again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony, being Tony, Wanted to make our parents coffee.\u201d Hope was saying. \u201cBut he hadn\u2019t actually made coffee before just, for some reason, fooled around with the machine and giving it an AI. Soon enough coffee was all over the room and ourselves. First time I\u2019d ever heard someone have an argument with a coffee machine.\u201d Everyone began laughing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey not my fault, that coffee machine was being an asshole,\u201d grumbled Tony. which only made them laugh harder. Steve kept glancing up and staring at the group as he picked a random box of noodles. He and his team sat at the table and ate in silence as they listened to the conversation occurring between the others. Natasha was staring at Bruce, Wanda at Vision, and Scott at Hope. But the entire group ignored them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, this is getting kind of irritating. Are you just gonna keep gawking at us or ask us the burning question obviously on your mind.\u201d the blond woman said suddenly facing them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm,\u201d Steve muttered, the woman raised an eyebrow expectantly. \u201cWho exactly are you?\u201d the woman sighed as if disappointed by the simplicity of the question. She glanced at Tony and the others, Tony shrugged still firmly avoiding Steve\u2019s eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine, I\u2019m Carol Danvers,\u201d She began to point to the unnamed people, \u201cStephen Strange, and Harley and Peter. I assume you already know the others.\u201d She looked at them as if she was saying </span>\n<em>\n<span>is that all? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t say anything as his mind struggled with deciding which question was the most important. Obviously, he took too long since the group started talking again. Now with Rhodes telling some other story about his and Tony\u2019s time in MIT. Steve noticed with a pang that Strange was whispering something to Tony. He stared back into the box of noodles. This was going to be harder than he thought.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou showed a surprising amount of kindness to them.\u201d Hope commented as, after dinner, the group left through the hall and sat in the smaller West Wing common room. Quite tired of all the stares from the Rogues. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I am actually trying to be a professional Team Lead who apparently isn\u2019t supposed to be biased so I kind of have to.\u201d Carol sighed. Vision floated towards their small bar. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould anyone like Tea?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hope and Carol both nodded thanking Vision, Rhodey just shrugged.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo thanks, Vis.\u201d Rhodey finally decided. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, thanks Vision.\u201d Bruce sighed gratefully.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing for us thanks,\u201d Peter said for himself and Harley.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony opened his mouth about to request coffee before Stephen interrupted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony and I would like some too thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut-\u201d Tony sputtered. \u201cCoffee.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo milk for Tony, but still Tea,\u201d Stephen added firmly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStephen.\u201d Tony wailed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou actually have to sleep tonight Tony if you don\u2019t want to collapse in training tomorrow. Coffee will keep you awake longer.\u201d Stephen said logically.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine. But don\u2019t expect me to be happy about this.\u201d Tony grumbled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less sweetie.\u201d Stephen mocked smirking at Tony who, very immaturely, poked his tongue out at the Doctor. Meanwhile, everyone was staring rather amused at the pair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vision floated back over sporting several mugs, Peter quickly jumped up to help the android. As the tea was passed around Tony stared sullenly into the dark liquid.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t even add any alcohol to this. You torture me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you\u2019re sober now too?\u201d Bruce asked taking a sip from his mug.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s unwilling.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpeaking of.\u201d Stephen formed a small portal and reached in grabbing the box and handing it to Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd here I was thinking you didn\u2019t practice medicine anymore.\u201d Tony glared.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFirstly you brought the subject up, secondly, this isn\u2019t practising medicine, it\u2019s reminding you to take some medicine, which is actually called caring,\u201d Stephen replied, Tony, rolled his eyes but took the box watched surprised by Bruce. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop panicking Brucie. These are mostly just since I\u2019m still technically post-op.\u201d He sighed with sarcastic regret. \u201cThe joy of having another new ribcage.\u201d Bruce\u2019s eyes widened at the comment but Stephen continued the sentence for the billionaire ignoring the lie about what the pills were for.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were the one who wanted the new ribcage, the surgery was supposed to just be for the new Arc Reactor.\u201d Tony shrugged.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was tired of it being broken all the time.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Meanwhile, having already had this conversation with Tony, Hope and Carol were talking about the organization of training the next day with Vision, Rhodey, and the attentive listening of the kids. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo is it going to be an actual exercise or just a free for all?\u201d Hope was asking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt would be good to test out the teams wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Rhodey from his seat next to Carol. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess so, I was thinking it should just be a vs thing at first but then I was wondering if we should get to know one another\u2019s limits in their powers. Especially certain no pardoned gods of mischief.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe can figure out the matches tonight if you want,\u201d Rhodey suggested to her. Carol grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got it second in command,\u201d she replied. From his seat Tony winked dramatically, wiggling his eyebrows to the knowledge of everyone. Rhodey scoffed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, your conversations with Stephen are 90% flirting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhich what makes them so interesting,\u201d Stephen answered making Rhodey snort and Tony to grin and his eyes flash with what Rhodey thought looked a lot like hope. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy, my.\u201d Tony suddenly said looking at the time. \u201cOff to bed kids or your Mum and Aunt will have my ass.\u201d Peter groaned standing up, followed by Harley. They moved with dramatic enthusiasm towards the bedrooms. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNight dad!\u201d Harley called cheerfully, giving them an overly dramatic wave. Peter snorted in synchronization with Tony and Rhodey.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNight kids! Sweet Dreams!\u201d Tony responded with an equally dramatic grin and blowing them a kiss. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDrama queen.\u201d sighed Stephen amused. Tony put a hand to his chest giving him a look of utmost shock. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh Doctor, you wound me.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Carol said raising an eyebrow and smiling. \u201cWe all should actually get to bed though. If not now then soon.\u201d She said the last sentence with a pointed look at Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAye Aye Captain,\u201d Tony replied saluting. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure that wasn\u2019t coffee?\u201d Bruce asked looking amused by the enthusiasm shown by Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRelatively sure.\u201d Vision said, \u201cunless Tony filled all the tea bags with coffee.\u201d Tony winked at him not providing an answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI actually have to do something back at the sanctum.\u201d Stephen informed them, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSuper secret wizard stuff?\u201d Tony asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave fun, Merlin.\u201d Tony snarked as Stephen formed a new portal into the Sanctum. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBye Bye Einstein, try and get more than 3 hours of sleep this year,\u201d called Stephen over his shoulder, waving at the others as the portal shut behind him. After he left everyone else began to head to their rooms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe and Tones will clean up Vis it\u2019s okay.\u201d Rhodey smiled at the android who nodded in thanks before phasing through a wall to his room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you in my room when you\u2019re done \u2018kay Rhodes?\u201d said Carol as she headed to the hall to the bedrooms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure Carol,\u201d Rhodey replied smiling somewhat dreamily as she left. Once Tony and Rhodey were the only ones remaining Tony smirked at the man.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are the Captain huh?\u201d Rhodey glanced happily at the man.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re good together,\u201d Tony reassured as he picked up the mugs from the table and carried them with Rhodey to the sink.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you and the Sorcerer Supreme huh?\u201d Rhodey mimicked. Tony blushed. \u201cOh don\u2019t bother denying it Tones. You guys are besotted with one another, you\u2019re just too full of yourselves to admit it.\u201d Tony smiled slightly looking at the now running tap.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d Rhodey snorted at that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously man, you\u2019re acting like a schoolgirl right now. Yes, I think so.\u201d Tony grinned at his friend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcellent words of reassurance buddy.\u201d He placed the now rinsed and emptied mugs into the dishwasher.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat man appears to be spending every free moment of his time with you. Basic sign of a crush.\u201d Tony snorted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFair enough. I guess we\u2019ll see what happens\u201d he clapped Rhodey\u2019s shoulder as they began to head to his room. \u201cGood luck with Marvel Platypus. And remember\u201d he whispered the next words suggestively. \u201cThe rooms are soundproof.\u201d Rhodey pushed Tony away blushing furiously. Tony chuckled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI hate you.\u201d sighed Rhodey but he was smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSleep tight honey bear.\u201d He winked at Rhodey before heading into his own room. Deciding, maybe because of the recommendation given by Stephen, that he would actually try and get some sleep.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHope, can I talk to you?\u201d Hope stopped and sighed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine Scott, but make it quick. We do have a meeting you know.\u201d Scott rushed up to her. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHope, I just want to say, I am so sorry about everything. I was an idiot who didn\u2019t find out enough about the accords or anything really when running off like a fool.\u201d Hope stared at him keeping her face neutral. \u201cLook, I understand if you don\u2019t want to forgive me but I just want you to know how sorry I am and to your dad too.\u201d Hope touched the small box in her pocket and considered the apology.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell Scott, you\u2019re right in calling yourself an idiot. As for me forgiving you? I probably will at some point.\u201d She smiled slightly. \u201cAnd kicking your ass in training today will definitely make me feel better.\u201d Scott snorted slightly and Hope smirked at him before turning and heading into the meeting room. She moved and sat next to Tony and Stephen. None of the Rogues except an awkward Scott was there yet but Carol and Rhodey were muttering to each other and entering things onto a tablet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs no one else here yet?\u201d she asked Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell if they get here in the next 3 minutes and 13 seconds they should be fine.\u201d he replied. \u201cI cannot wait for the shitstorm that is likely to happen when Thor and Loki get here.\u201d Tony groaned beginning to tap his Arc Reactor. The door opened and the Rogues, Bruce, and Vision filed in. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony,\u201d Bruce began sitting opposite the man. \u201cThor is bringing someone else with him apart from the obvious.\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho? And was it cleared by the council?\u201d Bruce nodded in answer to the second question before speaking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell her name is Brunnhilde, she\u2019s an Asgardian Valkyrie.\u201d Tony nodded intrigued. The door opened again and Harley and Peter came in with all the energy of children. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey kids, you sleep alright?\u201d Tony asked as they sat down next to Bruce. Harley nodded in sync with Peter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter was just showing me the new suit,\u201d Harley said with relative quiet to avoid the Rogues listening in too attentively from the other end of the table where they were talking in hushed voices and looking at them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s super awesome, thanks, Tony.\u201d Peter grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSoon enough your entire vocabulary will become the word thank you.\u201d Tony snorted but his face was filled with joy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, now we are just awaiting Thor and his\u2026 company.\u201d Carol said finally to those seated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThor\u2019s back then?\u201d Natasha asked he eyes kept on flicking to Bruce.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s been dealing with the remaining Asgardians,\u201d Carol informed them, at the word remaining Natasha raised an eyebrow. The door opened again and Thor stood in the doorway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAvengers!\u201d he cheered. \u201cIt is a pleasure to see you all again.\u201d Thor still hadn\u2019t left the doorway which confirmed the suspicions Tony was having about Loki being behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too Thor.\u201d Steve smiled and Tony looked away, panic rising in his throat at the voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWoah man, what happened to your eye?\u201d Sam asked in shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy sister stabbed it out\u201d Thor answered matter of factly. \u201cAfter destroying Mjolnir and before destroying Asgard.\u201d The room gaped at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come sit down Point Break?\u201d Tony suggested. Thor hesitated looking doubtfully over his shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Thor.\u201d Stephen said and the Cloak of Levitation floated over to the door from where it had been behind his chair with the intent to block attacks made to Loki. Thor nodded and stepped aside. The sight of Loki behind him began a deafening uproar with Clint jumping to his fight looking ready to tear the god in half.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFriends.\u201d Thor boomed. \u201cMy brother regrets his actions in New York and has proven himself worthy since.\u201d The noise settled down but a tension in the room remained.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike we should believe that.\u201d Clint hissed still not seated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true Clint.\u201d Bruce sighed from where he was sitting having smiled at the gods as they entered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBarton the council has already cleared this decision so don\u2019t bother disagreeing,\u201d Rhodey stated looking slightly wary of Loki.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan we just get this meeting started?\u201d Hope asked impatiently. Thor came and sat down, Loki following glaring straight ahead as he sat next to Thor. A woman followed after them looking frankly bored. Tony guessed this must be who Bruce was referring to. She grinned widely at Bruce and sat in the chair left in between Loki and Bruce leaning over and whispering something to Bruce while doing so.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThor, Loki, and Brunnhilde have all signed the accords and are Avengers so any attempt to harm Loki without recent provocation will result in your immediate termination from the Avengers initiative,\u201d Carol said firmly to the Rogues and Clint specifically. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow this meeting is mostly to make sure everyone knows what is happening,\u201d Rhodey added helpfully.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Rogues are going to remain on a team since they\u2019re all still on probation that\u2019s limiting their field work.\u201d Carol said getting some relieved looks from the Rogues. \u201cColonel Rhodes will be joining that team as the new team lead during combat.\u201d This however gave the Rogues pause.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut Steve has always led us,\u201d Wanda argued. Rhodey smiled grimly at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr Rogers has displayed an inability to lead fairly before and after what happened he is no longer going to be leading anything unless instructed to by his new Team Lead. The New Avengers already have Mr Stark in a similar suit as Iron Man and this is also to divvy up the heavy hitters.\u201d The Rogues made several protests but Carol ignored the protests.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you would like to make a formal complaint then take it up with the council.\u201d Carol continued. \u201cDue to the probation, your team will be serving as a backup unless in a major crisis.\u201d She addressed this to Rhodey who nodded in agreement. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThor will be also joining my team since the New Avengers team already has an energy wielder of a similar skillset. He has the option of Co-leading the team if he chooses.\u201d Thor smiled at Rhodey but seemed interested in who the new people were. \u201cLoki will be on the New Avengers team mainly to avoid conflict. As for Brunnhilde, a decision will be made after she demonstrates her skills in training today.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe kids will be placed on a team once they are of age.\u201d added Carol, \u201cand Dr Banner has requested that Hulk is only called upon in serious situations and this request has been approved so he is not assigned to a team.\u201d Bruce sighed looking thankful.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are their identities?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cThe kids I mean.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s that question to answer if they choose to,\u201d Carol said firmly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine with it.\u201d Harley shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m training as the next Iron Man.\u201d the Rogues gaped at that. Not only was Tony allowing someone else to use his suits, it was a kid and his well\u2026 replacement. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s going as Rescue at the moment,\u201d Tony informed them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIron Lad and Iron Boy sounded horrible.\u201d cringed Harley and then turned to Peter whispering something in his ear that made the boy snort. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs for me\u2026\u201d Peter began sounding unsure.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Carol said gently. Peter nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d he coughed awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m Spiderman.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was a long silence after that until Steve finally sputtered. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, that was responsible Stark, bringing a kid to Germany.\u201d Clint hissed. Peter glared at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, that was responsible Clint, leaving your family to go to Germany.\u201d Peter mimicked. Clint glared at the kid, fury in his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCalm down Clint,\u201d Steve said looking at the man. \u201cWe all made mistakes back then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSome were just bigger than others\u201d Harley commented darkly looking at the Rogues. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow Stark, you corrupted them good.\u201d Wanda sneered. Tony had his eyes closed and was drumming nervously on his Arc Reactor. Vision looked at her in disappointment causing her to fall silent.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGot them right onto your side.\u201d Clint growled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut it, Clint.\u201d Natasha snapped. Thor was looking immensely confused. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat exactly is happening?\u201d Thor asked Bruce but before Bruce could explain what he found out Harley snapped a reply to Clint.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cObviously it was corruption.\u201d He was saying sarcastically. \u201cDefinitely not you beating our father figure within an inch of his life!\u201d Steve paled at the reminder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? Lie to him? Shun him? Almost kill him?\u201d Peter snapped</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPeter, Harley, dial it down a bit bud.\u201d Tony said his voice dry and tight. Harley and Peter gave a final furious glare to the Rogues before muttering to each other darkly. Thor was looking horrified and even Loki was looking surprised and even a little sympathetic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat happened while I was away?\u201d he gaped at them all. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA lot of things Point Break.\u201d Tony replied voice still hoarse, and tapping even faster on the Arc Reactor. Stephen rested his hand on his shoulder and looked into his panicked eyes. Tony gulped down another panic attack. Phantom pain having a festivity in his chest. </span>\n<em>\n<span>It\u2019s okay. I won\u2019t let them hurt you. </span>\n</em>\n<span>The words projected themselves into Tony\u2019s mind with Stephen\u2019s voice and he calmed slightly. Tony rubbed his face with his hands, breathing deeply.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyway, moving on.\u201d Carol was saying, directing a furious glare at Clint and the Rogues. \u201cBehaviour such as that will result in the end of your probation and your time as Avengers.\u201d Rhodey continued stiffly also glaring at the Rogues. \u201cThis meeting is adjourned, please take this time to prepare for training in two hours.\u201d Hope pushed a small box into Scott\u2019s hands. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour new suit. Took a lot of convincing but Dad finally did it.\u201d She then left after Tony who at the end of Carol\u2019s sentence had quickly stood up and walked quickly out of the room followed closely by Stephen who was followed by the other New Avengers. Tony didn\u2019t stop walking until he was at his lab. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony.\u201d Stephen said. Tony didn\u2019t reply instead collapsing on the sofa, putting his head in his hands and attempting to slow the hyperventilation. He vaguely registered Stephen offering him the medication that would calm him down but waved it away clumsily so Stephen just sat down next to him saying comforting sounding things as the Cloak of Levitation drifted down to his shoulder and hugged him in comfort. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo.\u201d Tony finally managed. \u201cYou\u2019re telepathic now?\u201d Stephen gave him a slightly irritated at Tony ignoring what had just happened but he just sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOnly when wearing the Eye of Agamotto,\u201d Stephen answered seated next to Tony. DUM-E came over making chirping noises and Tony absentmindedly patted his robotic arm. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Are you okay Boss?\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY asked nervously. Tony leaned back in the sofa rubbing his chest and Arc Reactor repeatedly breathing as much air into his lungs as possible. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine baby girl.\u201d Tony murmured closing his eyes wishing his racing heart would slow the fuck down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony?\u201d Harley rushed in followed by Peter, both looking apologetic and guilty. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re so sorry.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to spaz you out.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t speak about you like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re super sorry.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony opened his eyes looking at them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine guys, just me freaking out.\u201d he attempted a smile but Stephen thought it looked more like a grimace. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAt least there\u2019s no snow for you to throw at me this time,\u201d Harley said jokingly. Tony snorted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll probably find something.\u201d Rhodey came into the room looking nervous.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou alright man?\u201d Tony made some noise of agreement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust need to calm down before training.\u201d Rhodey made a noise of disbelief at that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Rhodes?\u201d asked Harley. \u201cCan I just stay down here and practice with the suits some more? I doubt I\u2019m ready for any kind of combat.\u201d Rhodey smiled kindly at Harley. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure man, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d Harley thanked him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Doc, are you bringing the Eye thing to training?\u201d asked Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Eye of Agamotto.\u201d Stephen corrected, \u201cProbably not, it is extremely powerful.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTrue, but the telepathy thing is pretty neat,\u201d Tony argued casually. Stephen understood what he was getting at though.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFair point. I\u2019ll bring it then.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony got to his feet the Cloak helping him remain balanced in his damned shaky state. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting coffee are you?\u201d sighed Stephen. Tony shrugged. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI find it oddly calming.\u201d Stephen rolled his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure you want to train today?\u201d Rhodey asked Tony outside the training room later. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you had serious surgery barely a month ago. You also had a panic attack barely an hour ago.\u201d Rhodey pointed out. Tony sighed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI feel fine Platypus, besides, I\u2019ve fought villains in worse states.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a good point Tony.\u201d Tony ignored him instead going over to Stephen as the Cloak finally lifted itself from his shoulders and returned to the wizard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTime for the big reveal.\u201d Tony grinned putting a finger on his Arc Reactor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI seem to be really looking forward to the event now\u201d Stephen smiled tucking the Eye of Agamotto into his robes. He and Tony followed Rhodey into the training room. Everyone was there and suited up except for Carol, Bruce who was in a chair working as he watched, and Tony. Tony grinned at Peter who smiled back and walked over looking awesome in the Iron Spider. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo everyone. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work.\u201d Carol started. \u201cTo test each other\u2019s power and strengths we will be fighting either 1v1 or in small groups at a time. We don\u2019t exactly want anything exploding so\u2026\u201d She nodded at Stephen who stepped forward and made a sharp motion. There was a cracking as the very air seemed to splinter at his touch. Stephen entered followed by Carol who made a \u2018come on\u2019 gesture. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once everyone was in Stephen spoke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is the Mirror Dimension. We won\u2019t harm the real world here.\u201d Most everyone was gaping at the strange place. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo everyone could just hang out at the side so there is enough space to practice.\u201d Loki made a gesture and enough chairs for everyone appeared. They all sat, the Rogues looking wary of the chairs conjured. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhile you wait your turn you\u2019re welcome to do whatever you want as long as you don\u2019t interfere with the fight. Or you could watch.\u201d Rhodey offered. Everyone made noises of agreement. Brunnhilde had found a bottle of alcohol from somewhere and was now chugging it. Rhodey looked at her disapprovingly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to stop her,\u201d Bruce mentioned without looking up from the tablet he was working on. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t do anything sober.\u201d Rhodey sighed and looked around. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyone want to go first?\u201d No one really offered so Hope sighed and stood up. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on Scott. Don\u2019t bother going easy on me, it\u2019s likely to just make me angrier at you.\u201d Scott got up looking nervous. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnt-Man vs Wasp.\u201d smiled Rhodey.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKick his ass Hope.\u201d cheered Tony. Hope snorted and rolled her eyes. Her helmet flipped on covering her face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Hope asked Scott. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess so-\u201d before he finished speaking Hope had kicked his legs out from underneath him. Scott fell with a bang and several cheers came from the audience of the others. \u201cOw,\u201d Scott muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s on then.\u201d his helmet flipped up as he spun around getting back up as he began to grow twice his size, punching Hope backwards. Hope chuckled, </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting into it.\u201d She began to unfurl her wings as she was hit backwards..</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have wings.\u201d wailed Scott.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan\u2019t grow as well though.\u201d as her wings finished snapping open she shrunk down into a speck and ran up Scott\u2019s arm. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot happening.\u201d Scott shrunk down as well and fell to the floor, he looked up seeing Hope fly down to him and before he could react she seized his arms and spun him into the air. Scott cried out as her foot connected with his chest sending him flying back to crash into the sharded wall. He went back to regular size as he crashed back to the ground. Hope appeared next to him and her helmet retracted as she held him against the wall with her arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou done?\u201d she asked smirking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d He sent his knee into her stomach, and as she was pushed back, shrunk down again. He grew back up behind her and attempted to punch her. Hope shrunk back down for a second to dodge it before returning to normal size and jumping on him from behind. She held his arm behind his back and aimed a blaster at his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNever,\u201d Scott answered stubbornly. She began to apply pressure to his arm into he yelled and banged his hand on the floor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m done, I\u2019m done.\u201d Hope got off him and offered a hand. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour fightings rusty.\u201d she gave him a small smile before heading back to sit down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright Hope!\u201d Tony congratulated high fiving her. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d asked Carol. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho can I fight?\u201d asked Brunnhilde.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRogers. You have an opponent.\u201d Carol smiled. Steve got up looking at the opposing woman dressed in silver armour and armed with a sword. He flicked his shields out and smiled at her. Brunnhilde rolled her eyes and moved to the centre of the room looking at him challenging. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The whole fight didn\u2019t last longer than three minutes and before long Steve was pinned against the wall with an alarming amount of strength and with a sword a centimetre from his throat. Stephen was choking from laughter and Tony was having a hard time keeping a straight face. Several people, more specifically Loki and Thor, were laughing out loud. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d Brunnhilde said simply before heading back to her seat and sheathing her sword. Steve looked embarrassed as he sat back down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wish to fight someone!\u201d Thor boomed enthusiastically. Carol grinned. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re up against me God of Thunder.\u201d she glowed slightly as her casual clothes morphed into a blue, red, and gold armour complete with a star on her breast. \u201cDon\u2019t bother holding back, especially with your lightning.\u201d Thor beamed excitedly as he moved to the centre of the room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is your hero identity?\u201d he asked curiously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey call me Captain Marvel.\u201d She floated into the air looking relieved to be flying again. Her eyes and hands began to glow and crackle. \u201cI\u2019m the other energy harnesser talked about in the meeting. Thor looked ecstatic to be fighting someone of similar powers as the blue glow of lightning crackled around him. The fight that followed was hard to watch, mostly because the combined forces of their energy was blinding. Captain Marvel zoomed towards Thor and dodging several blows began to crackle brighter with every contact with Thor\u2019s electrical skin. Thor was getting more intrigued with every failed hit. She seemed to know what he was doing before he did it. Finally a punch sent Captain Marvel flying back through the air, she spun in mid air as Thor gathered up as much lightning as he could. The force of the resulting lightning blast sent Marvel pummeling towards the ground. Thor could dimly see the silhouette of her standing up in the haze of electricity. When the lightning had dissipated Captain Marvel glowed brighter than ever and smiled, her hands and eyes blinding with light. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d she flew into the air at the speed of light and her hands began to Glow brighter as she looked down at Thor. Thor jumped into the air about to make another attack when Captain Marvel released an energy blast so powerful the audience had to cover their eyes. Thor crashed into the wall held there by the strength of the blast. He fell to the floor and Captain Marvel had flown to his side in milliseconds. She pinned his arms behind his back. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are extremely powerful,\u201d commented Thor. Carol grinned as the energy faded from her skin. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy thank you. You\u2019re not bad yourself.\u201d She stood up smiling at Thor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHoly Shit,\u201d yelled Brunnhilde loudly gaping at them both. Loki appeared beside them smiling slightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was much appreciated,\u201d he said smiling at Carol who smirked at Thor. \u201cIn other news, you definitely need a new hammer, Thor.\u201d Thor frowned. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know that. I just wanted to drop you guys off on Midgard first.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf it makes you feel better it\u2019s mostly because of the pre-cognition that I beat you.\u201d Carol comforted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that the most powerful you can get?\u201d Loki asked curiously. Carol grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf I absorb strong enough energy I become Binary for a while and Binary is way more powerful.\u201d She considered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t happen often though.\u201d She gave a final smile to Thor before turning back to the others. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was so incredibly awesome,\u201d Peter said in awe. Carol smiled at him as her suit morphed back into her favourite leather jacket.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho wants to go next?\u201d Peter jumped up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I?\u201d Carol smiled, \u201cSure, you\u2019re against Falcon, Hawkeye, and Widow.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThree people?\u201d Tony asked in worry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s just because he has superpowers and they don\u2019t mostly.\u201d Rhodey explained. Sam rolled his eyes as he stood up followed by Natasha and Clint. Peter was already on the ceiling with his mask on. Tony snorted slightly at the enthusiasm. During the fight Peter mostly jumped and swung around the moment that scared Tony the most being when he fell and was jumped by Natasha but the Iron Spider legs got him out of that quickly and the shocked cries at the sudden metal appendages would be something that Tony cherished. By the time Wilson had been webbed down Peter was laughing as he jumped around happily. He dodged a stun arrow as it whizzed by his face and grabbed the second aimed towards his chest. He sent several globs of webbing around Clint and watched amused from above as they exploded and covered the man. Peter landed in front of Natasha in his signature spider crouch. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpider versus Spider the ultimate showdown,\u201d he said grinning under the mask. Natasha raised an eyebrow looking amused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you kid.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha jumped making a swipe with her stun gloves. Peter ducked and flipped over her aiming a kick at her chest. Natasha grabbed his foot and yanked making Peter lose his balance. She put him in a choke hold and sighed as she electrified one of the stun gloves preparing to knock Peter out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKAREN.\u201d Peter said frantically, \u201cTaserweb\u201d the web shot from his wrist and hit Natasha\u2019s foot mere milliseconds after the glove had come into contact with Peter. They both collapsed. Tony rushed over. Peter\u2019s mask retracted and after several seconds he blinked and grinned at Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tony asked worriedly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t lose,\u201d Peter said proudly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t win either kid,\u201d smirked Tony helping Peter to his feet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha smiled good-naturedly at Peter who looked nervously back. She had begun to cut the webs entangling Clint away with a knife. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell played kid,\u201d Clint muttered once free looking none too happy about losing. After the web had all been vanished by Stephen, Rhodey looked at Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to go now?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure, get ready for some embarrassing loss,\u201d Tony smirked walking to the middle of the room. Rhodey rolled his eyes and stepped into the waiting War Machine suit. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, Friend Stark?\u201d Thor asked confused. \u201cYou are lacking your armour.\u201d Tony grinned at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot for a while now Pointbreak.\u201d Rhodey stood now suited opposite Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on man suit up.\u201d Tony smirked obnoxiously. Then brought his hands up, flicking them down to reveal little black bits of metal expanding from the Arc Reactor. He tapped the blue glow twice and Red and gold began to flow like water over his body encasing it in first a silver skeleton then the familiar red and gold of an Iron Man suit. The helmet encased Tony\u2019s face and he put a foot back getting into a defensive stance as metal separated from the suit forming floating Proton Cannons around him and enlarging his hands into repulsor cannons. The audience gaped at this drastic and unexpected upgrade.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, you weren\u2019t kidding at the idea of a big reveal.\u201d Bruce stared in fascination.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou upgraded to this in six months\u201d Scott gaped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cC\u2019mon Man.\u201d Rhodey groaned the faceplate retracting to reveal his shocked and annoyed face. \u201cThat\u2019s just showing off. You couldn\u2019t have humoured me first?\u201d Tony\u2019s helmet retracted revealing his smug face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat would\u2019ve been a lot less dramatic.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI hate you.\u201d sighed Rhodey tiredly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes this mean you just forfeited?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo?\u201d Rhodey replied sounding unsure. Suddenly his helmet snapped down and he shot two missiles at the Proton cannons causing them to blow apart. Tony glared at him, helmet covering his head again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was just rude.\u201d One of the machine guns began to release a spray of bullets at Tony who quickly formed a large shield to shelter behind. Tony flew into the air firing a group of nanites at the offending gun. The nanites swarmed over the gun disabling it. Tony shot back down towards Rhodey and forming two blades began to slash at Warmachine. Rhodey fired a unibeam blast at Tony and he was blasted back the armour quickly knitted itself back together as if no damage had been done. Tony reformed the repulsor cannons and gave Rhodey two quick blasts sending him back against the wall. Tony shot into the air followed by Rhodey were the two grappled for a short while before Tony formed his hands into Jackhammers and began to bash the Warmachine armour down. Tony\u2019s armour formed a clasp on the boot and pinned Warmachine down before his hand formed an even deadlier and more powerful hammer which knocked Warmachine down. Two more shots of nanites held Warmachine to the ground and Tony came over his helmet coming off again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou forfeiting now?\u201d Rhodey rolled his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine, but you need to upgrade my armour again,\u201d Tony smirked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll see now back to papa guys.\u201d the nanites slid back from where they held Rhodey down and around the room. They formed back into the armour as if they never left and then the entire armour slid back into the Arc Reactor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou okay buddy?\u201d Tony asked Rhodey stood up and stepped out of the armour sending the suit back to stand by the wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine just a little beaten up.\u201d He shook his head fondly at Tony as they went back to their seats. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was certainly impressive.\u201d Stephen smiled at Tony who smirked smugly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cScience just displayed its awesomeness, now go and display the awesomeness of magic Doc.\u201d Stephen smiled and stood up, moving to the centre of the room. Steve was still gaping at Tony who was still ignoring him. His shield upgrades seemed childish in comparison to the new Iron Man suit and his powers seemed boring after seeing all the New Avengers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStephen.\u201d \u00a0Carol said, \u201cYou will be fighting Wanda and then whoever wins will fight Loki.\u201d Stephen nodded and looked expectantly at Wanda who stood and moved over to face Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready Ms Maximoff.\u201d Stephen spoke with an irritating calmness as he took the Eye of Agamotto out from under his robes. Wanda quickly summoned a red ball of energy to her hands and flung it at Stephen who moved his hands and formed a shield around himself that the magic slammed into dissolving into the air. A spare chair flew through the air and Wanda split it apart with one motion. She spun sending the two chair halves at Stephen who was quickly protected by the Cloak of levitation. Pulling his hands apart a string of energy appeared and Stephen swung it towards Wanda who blocked it with a reddish mist of magic. Stephen retaliated by whipping the energy around her leg and causing her to fall over with a quick motion. Wanda pushed back with Magic causing Stephen to falter and fly back into the air. Red magic began to surround Stephen which seemed too much for the man to handle. However when Wanda looked ready to ask him to surrender Stephen uttered something and the magic dissipated, the Cloak of Levitation quickly flew out to protect Strange. Wanda glared at him and prepared to cast again when Stephen made several motions and a glowing, translucent sphere made up of odd symbols formed around him. Wanda gasped and collapsed the red glow fading from her fingers. At the same time, Loki, who was seated and watching the events with intrigue, gasped and shuddered he stared at his hands for a second before glaring furiously at Strange who smirked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Wanda asked a mixture of anger and curiosity in her voice. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWeakened nearby magic users powers.\u201d Stephen replied matter of factly. Thor made a noise of understanding after having been confused at Loki\u2019s random reaction. Wanda made a move towards Strange and they began to battle hand to hand. Stephen was obviously going easy on Wanda and her meager combat skills. Eventually he made a quick movement and glowing energy streams restrained her. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Wanda muttered icily. \u201cYou win.\u201d Stephen smiled in satisfaction and the effects of his magic were removed. Loki and Wanda began to rub their hands both glaring at Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess it\u2019s Loki versus Stephen then,\u201d Carol said cheerfully. Loki stood up still glaring at Strange. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is likely to be long and entertaining.\u201d Loki snarked, Stephen, smiled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAt least we can agree on that.\u201d Stephen began to fly into the air until he was looking down at Loki.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight flying are we?\u201d Loki asked smirking, he began to rise up into the air, he crossed his legs and looked at Strange challengingly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can fly brother?\u201d Thor questioned surprised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve been able to for ages, I just haven\u2019t,\u201d Loki replied coolly, then there were almost 20 Loki\u2019s in the room all glaring at Strange. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, we\u2019re doing that are we?\u201d Stephen said more to himself than Loki, he crossed his arms in an X and multiple versions of his arms opened up from his side. They split until a circle of Stephen\u2019s surrounded Loki. Loki smirked amused, each Loki turning to face a Stephen. The Loki\u2019s and Stephen\u2019s moved in synchronization. Each made an attack, Stephen\u2019s with strings of energy and Loki with a dagger. The Loki\u2019s and Stephen\u2019s disappeared, leaving the originals to glare at one another. Loki sent a dagger at Stephen and with a wave of his hand the dagger turned around and shot back at Loki who caught it be the blade and threw it down. There was a screech from Loki as his body began to transform. The audience gave several yells of shock and fright when all of a sudden there was a large green dragon staring down Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The dragon lunged making a snap at the man who flew backwards out of the dragons range. Loki roared and a fiery burst exploded from the dragon\u2019s mouth. Stephen swept his hands out and cutting the fire in half so it swept around him. He gathered the fire together and shot it back at the dragon who hissed as the flames scattered over his skin. Making a motion and uttering something the dragon began to screech as it was forced to change back into Loki. Loki fell to the ground and landed in a crouch a snarl on his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo Strange!\u201d cheered Tony along with several others who didn\u2019t want Loki to win. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He conjured up at least a hundred daggers and threw them at Stephen who with a wave turned them into a hundred pink butterflies. The butterflies flew and tickled Loki\u2019s face who regarded them with minor interest at their colour before looking back at Stephen anger on his face. Loki disappeared and then reappeared behind Strange grabbing the man's shoulder. Ice spread from his hand and began to cover Stephen\u2019s body. A look of minor shock appeared on the Sorcerer's face and panic began to rise in Tony. Just before the Ice covered his face Stephen uttered another word and the ice broke. He spun, breaking free from Loki\u2019s grasp. Loki quickly conjured up another dagger and stabbed Stephen. A gasp rose from several of the audience as the Eye of Agamotto enlarged blocking the attack. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cInteresting amulet you have there,\u201d Loki commented as the attack was blocked. Stephen hummed in acknowledgement as he grabbed Loki\u2019s wrist. A glowing band appeared there and Loki fell down. He growled at Strange before closing his eyes and going limp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, what?\u201d asked Peter worriedly. Stephen furrowed his brow for a second before seeming to understand something. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo we\u2019re doing that,\u201d he muttered before going limp himself the cloak holding him afloat. Rising from his physical form Stephen saw Loki looking at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d Loki mused as he watched Stephen\u2019s limp body. Then he dived for Stephen and they grappled in mid-air, Stephen managed to kick Loki away and quickly broke into the physical plane. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStephen? What the hell?\u201d Tony almost shouted at him. \u201cYou gave us a heart attack.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry Tony, apparently we\u2019re fighting in our astral forms now.\u201d Tony glared at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that supposed to make any sense.\u201d Before Stephen could reply Loki broke through as well and tore at Stephen, They spun in mid-air Loki managing to punch Stephen several times in the face. Stephen grabbed the man and threw him through the wall. Stephen followed and those not fighting gaped at what was happening. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am so confused right now,\u201d Rhodey muttered staring at the point Loki and Stephen had gone through the wall. Several people jumped as Loki reappeared and flew towards Stephen\u2019s physical form. He made a motion towards his head and spoke some words softly. Stephen burst through the wall and upon seeing Loki\u2019s actions hissed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMind control is not allowed.\u201d The Clint\u2019s eyes widened the most at that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou never said that,\u201d Loki smirked before disappearing. Stephen disappeared as well and jerked awake in the physical world. Stephen was about to cast something when his eyes glazed over. Tony jumped up about to do something when Stephen moved his hand and the band on Loki\u2019s wrist broke off. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMuch better.\u201d sighed Loki rubbing his wrist. Tony was about to jump the god and tear him in half himself when the Eye of Agamotto glowed and Stephen\u2019s eyes reverted back to normal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAsshole.\u201d he glared at Loki who smirked back. He made a motion and a circle appeared under Loki.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot again.\u201d Loki cried before falling through the hole which closed behind him. Stephen floated back to the ground and began to walk back to the chairs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him back in half an hour or so,\u201d Stephen said to Carol as he walked past.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou idiot,\u201d Tony muttered, poking Stephen as he sat down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease,\u201d Stephen started offended. \u201cI\u2019m a hot idiot if anything.\u201d Tony grinned at the man.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After everyone had trained the Avengers dispersed. Stephen bringing back Loki who glared at the man, swearing profusely in several alien languages before oddly enough complimenting him on his magic skills. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVision?\u201d Wanda called as Vision began to head back to his room. He paused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, Ms Maximoff?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVis please.\u201d She begged reaching for his hands but her skin phased through it. Her eyes burned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought you had forgiven me. For what I had done.\u201d Vision looked at her, almost sadly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI had, but then you didn\u2019t change. If one does not change for the better after regretting something then forgiveness is not deserved.\u201d Wanda blinked her eyes, determined not to burst into tears. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Vision. I can be better. I can be good.\u201d Vision considered this. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can already be good. I wanted you to be kind.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be kind,\u201d Wanda said firmly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d Vision replied before turning and phasing through a wall. Wanda wiped her eyes choking back sobs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony stumbled into the West Wing common room, another night lacking sleep meaning he sported dark shadows under his eyes, tousled hair, and a half asleep expression. The coffee machine started up and he moved in the direction of the noise. The beautiful scent of fresh coffee made him sigh as he managed to stare at the mug filling with dark liquid at a sickeningly slow pace. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo sleep?\u201d At the voice Tony jumped a foot in the air and spun around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus- fucking- christ Strange! Give a man a heart attack why don\u2019t you?!\u201d Tony blinked several times in an attempt to wake himself up first. Stephen was watching him in amusement, his own mug embraced in his shaking hands. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou walked right by me so it wasn\u2019t actually intentional.\u201d Stephen sipped the liquid in his cup. The constant image of perfect calmness. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Tony muttered glaring at the still filling coffee. \u201cWhat are you doing awake even? It\u2019s only\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u201812:52 Boss.\u2019</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlready?\u201d Tony looked at his watch to confirm FRIDAY\u2019s response.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere you holed up in the lab again?\u201d Stephen asked disapprovingly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo actually, the mix of regular nightmares, phantom pain, and nightmares induced from the phantom pain just kept me from sleep.\u201d Tony retorted avoiding Stephen\u2019s eyes and willing the coffee to fill faster. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat can get quite irritating.\u201d Stephen answered in a soothing yet knowing. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot especially.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOk.\u201d With Stephen\u2019s reply Tony eyed the doctor suspiciously. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to push me to tell you?\u201d Tony asked as he picked up the finally finished coffee.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d Stephen said matter of factly. Tony smiled in relief.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod I love you.\u201d Tony sighed grinning at Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTrust me, the feeling\u2019s mutual.\u201d Stephen smiled back, joy in his eyes. They stared at one another for several seconds when Hope spoke from where she had appeared right next to them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo this is incredibly adorable and everything but can you either kiss or get out of the way of the coffee machine.\u201d she was staring at said machine longingly. Tony smirked at Stephen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine with the first option.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Stephen\u2019s grin grew and Hope groaned. \u201cGo eyefuck somewhere else that isn\u2019t blocking the caffeine.\u201d she begged. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWay to interrupt the moment Hope. I was really feeling the gay.\u201d Tony grumbled</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe gay you\u2019re eminatting isn\u2019t confined to that spot trust me. You will end up suffocating the world with the unresolved gayness surrounding you guys.\u201d She was still gazing at the coffee machine and Tony rolled his eyes smiling slightly before he and Stephen edged away from the coffee machine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow where were we.\u201d Tony smiled flirtatiously at Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m reading too much into the situation but I believe we were going with option one.\u201d Stephen replied eyes glinting. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine with that.\u201d Tony winked and pressed his lips to Stephen\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Rhodey and Carol came in later the first thing they saw was Tony asleep on the couch with his head on an also sleeping Stephen\u2019s lap. The Cloak of Levitation was settled on top of them both.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell it\u2019s about damn time.\u201d Rhodey smiled heading over to the table Hope was working at. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTheir sexual tension between them would\u2019ve ended up destroying the universe before Thanos had his chance.\u201d Carol added. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou should\u2019ve been here when they were making out.\u201d Hope retorted. \u201cIt got quite distracting while I was coding.\u201d She looked up at them. \u201cWhere\u2019d the cat come from.\u201d Carol smiled at the cat she had cradled in her arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe found him while out walking.\u201d Hope opened her mouth looking amused. \u201cBefore you ask he was homeless so we didn\u2019t steal him.\u201d Hope closed her mouth smirking. Peter entered the room Harley following behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMorning.\u201d they yawned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAfternoon.\u201d Rhodey replied. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTeenagers.\u201d sighed Hope typing quickly. At the sight of Tony and Stephen, the kids grinned looking at each other and then at the others. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep.\u201d Rhodey grinned motioning them to come over. At the sight of the cat they grinned wider.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is adorable.\u201d Peter smiled scratching the cats ears. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChewie.\u201d answered Carol. At that Peter\u2019s entire face lit up. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are amazing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNerds.\u201d scoffed Rhodey amused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy thank you.\u201d Carol smirked at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs anything happening today?\u201d Harley asked sitting down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot really. There is a charity thing this evening but Tony and Stephen were going to go to represent the Avengers.\u201d Rhodey replied scratching his chin. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo nothing then.\u201d Hope summarised. Peter stood back up from patting Chewie and headed to the fridge. He closed the door to the fridge and jumped back a foot dropping the carton of milk which was quickly recovered with a flick of his wrist and the new web shooters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLoki.\u201d He stuttered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpider.\u201d Loki replied from where he was leaning against the wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought you were staying with the Asgardians?\u201d asked Harley watching them from the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes but they get so dull sometimes.\u201d Loki stated surveying the room. His eyes stopped a millisecond on Stephen and Tony before looking back at Peter who scrambled away from the fridge looking slightly nervous.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI actually wanted to talk to the wizard about something but he appears to be a bit- preoccupied- at the moment so I guess I\u2019ll just wait.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight.\u201d Rhodey said before turning away from the god. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHang on what time is it.\u201d Hope asked looking at her watch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIsn\u2019t a bit pointless to ask the time while looking at your watch?\u201d Harley questioned snorting. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCrap. I gotta go guys. I\u2019m late meeting my dad.\u201d Hope jumped up pulling the box containing her suit out of her pocket and shrinking the tablet she had been working on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs it that hard to carry a regular sized item.\u201d snickered Carol. Hope glared at her before rolling her eyes and hurrying out. \u201cSpeaking of time, I should wash Chewie.\u201d Carol stood up cradling the purring cat before walking out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s going to end well.\u201d Rhodey sighed pulling out his phone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave you seen Stark?\u201d asked Sam, \u201cI needed him to look at my wings.\u201d Wanda snorted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike he\u2019d do that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot for days.\u201d answered Steve irritated. Everytime Tony had spotted them he had either ignored Steve\u2019s questions completely or walked in the opposite direction. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe is purposely trying to be difficult.\u201d grumbled Clint. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHasn\u2019t he always.\u201d argued Wanda.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFRIDAY? Where is Tony?\u201d tried Steve again. As per usual, there was no answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFRIDAY please.\u201d Steve begged. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Boss is out doing press.\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY replied sounding highly annoyed. </span>\n<b>\u2018I will not be telling you any more. Boss has more important things on his mind then your inquiries.\u2019 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just want to talk.\u201d Steve muttered. \u201cThis is just getting ridiculous. Tony is acting childish when some of us are just trying to put this behind us.\u201d There was no answer and Steve huffed, resound to sit in the Main Common Room until Tony returned from wherever. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe probably is \u2018doing press\u2019 just not in the PR sense.\u201d Clint growled clenching his fists. Wanda\u2019s face darkened. Natasha sighed and stood up leaving to her room. She had been getting more and more fed up with them for a while now. Scott had mostly been avoiding them which didn\u2019t bother Steve that much. He didn\u2019t really know Scott </span>\n<em>\n<span>that </span>\n</em>\n<span>well. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>An hour later Steve looked up from his sketchbook to the noise coming from the hall. He couldn\u2019t make out the words but it was definitely Tony and someone else.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c-go get the damn thing then. I won\u2019t wait for you though\u2026 Oh who am I kidding, I will.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice started making more sense as they grew closer. There was a chuckle and then Tony\u2019s was the only set of feet heading this way. Steve stood up the others tensing. Tony entered the room looking at his tablet. He was wearing a suit so FRIDAY must not of been lying when it said he was coming from an event. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony?\u201d At the sound of Steve\u2019s voice Tony turned sharply. Paling slightly before replacing his usual expression.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRogers.\u201d Tony replied stiffly before continuing to the door. Steve moved in front of him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just want to talk. You\u2019ve been avoiding us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just want to go to bed.\u201d Tony replied before stepping around him. Wanda\u2019s red magic surrounded the door and Tony stopped. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike the </span>\n<em>\n<span>great Tony Stark </span>\n</em>\n<span>ever sleeps.\u201d Clint snorted also standing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you\u2019ll hold me in this room against my will. How mature.\u201d Tony said coolly ignoring Clint. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic Tony, we just want to talk.\u201d Steve sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen talk.\u201d Tony stated. \u201cYou probably have a couple of minutes before whoever FRIDAY alerted arrives.\u201d Steve glared at the immature man for a second before speaking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding us.\u201d Steve began. \u201cWe are trying to put what happened behind us and you are making that impossible.\u201d Tony turned sneering at them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve already put it behind me, except for the PTSD, thanks for that by the way. I don\u2019t actually have to see you at all apart from during training and meetings so if I don\u2019t want to talk to you I don\u2019t have to.\u201d Tony turned back towards the door obviously preparing to break through. Steve grabbed Tony\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook at us.\u201d At the touch Tony flinched severely, jerking out of Steve\u2019s grasp and glaring at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAgain, no thank you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony.\u201d Steve stepped forward again, Tony stepped back in an attempt to keep distance between them, instead he pressed up against the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve already apologized, we should just go back to how things used to be.\u201d Tony snorted attempting to conceal the overwhelming panic filling him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou mean the shit letter you sent me? The one in which the words </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m Sorry </span>\n</em>\n<span>were never actually written?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who actually should be apologizing Stark.\u201d Wanda growled red magic still consuming her fingers. Tony shook his head disbelieving. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine Tony, If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d Steve sighed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, now will you talk to me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat sounded </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>convincing.\u201d Steve glared at Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow about we try a conversation? How about\u2026 Where\u2019s my shield?\u201d Tony grimaced at the mention of the weapon.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI should\u2019ve known this was about your precious shield.\u201d Tony hissed, the pain of his chest throbbing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to it Stark?\u201d Clint growled. Tony considered for a moment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d he spoke mockingly. \u201cI melted it down with info gotten from Wakanda\u2026 And then I made it into my new ribcage. Kind of poetic you know? The thing that smashes in your ribcage </span>\n<em>\n<span>again, </span>\n</em>\n<span>is used to make a new one.\u201d There was a shocked silence. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re a selfish bastard you know Stark?\u201d Wanda growled obviously ignoring the smashed in ribcage part. She moved forward threateningly causing Tony to press himself into the wall. Her magic swelled around her hands and her eyes darkened as she brought one hand to his head, pushing a hard force of magic against his chest with the other. Nothing happened. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Wanda asked confused as to why her usual mind trick wasn\u2019t working. Tony had fallen silent and was barely breathing pressed against the wall looking like a deer in headlights. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A glowing portal opened and Stephen stepped out, Steve was irked to see he was also in a suit but unlike the tie, Tony was wearing, sported a bow tie that had been undone after the event.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony, FRIDAY said there was an is-\u201d he stopped speaking as he saw the situation in front of him. Tony pressed against the wall, Wanda in front of him with magic swirling her fingers and around Tony. Steve and Clint both in defensive stances and Sam just chilling in the background. His face darkened considerably and he looked truly terrifying as he glared at them with enough fury to kill them then and there. Steve saw his mouth move and hands flash and then there was darkness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony?\u201d Stephen said in worry rushing over to the frozen man in worry. Tony didn\u2019t move still staring straight ahead and eyes wide in terror. Stephen hesitantly took his hand and after no reaction hugged a comforting arm around his shoulder, leading him to the West Wing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThose assholes are lucky I didn\u2019t curse them.\u201d Stephen hissed, eyes flashing in anger. \u201cWhy you let them come back so\u2026 kindly\u2026 I\u2019ll never know.\u201d Stephen brought Tony into the darkness of his room, FRIDAY setting the light to a dim glow. Tony regained vague consciousness as he stiffly lay down eyes still filled with terror of whatever memories the encounter had brought on. Stephen sat down next to Tony in the bed. Tony hesitantly put an arm around Stephen\u2019s waist. Stephen breathed in sharply as he noticed Tony was shaking. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m so Sorry.\u201d He whispered to Tony. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left even for those few minutes.\u201d Tony shook his head slightly still shaking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d He murmured into the bedclothes. Stephen sighed and placed a gentle kiss on Tony\u2019s for, he thought steadily darker thoughts about the Rogues, as he listened to Tony\u2019s breathing eventually grow slower and more calmed as the shaking stopped and he relaxed into Stephen\u2019s comfort</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo Stephen,\u201d Hope asked looking at the man. \u201cScott was wondering what happened to the other Rogues and FRIDAY told me to find you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Stephen didn\u2019t answer straight away instead he added some tea leaves to a cup before talking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell isn\u2019t that interesting\u201d Hope sighed and leant against the counter glancing briefly at Tony asleep on the couch. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay. What did they do.\u201d Stephen drank from his cup before answering, a dark look crossing his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAccording to Tony, it\u2019s just their usual assholeyness.\u201d He glared angrily at nothing in particular.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d Hope said raising her eyebrows.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat they cornered him, demanded to talk to him, and mind raped him </span>\n<em>\n<span>again</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Hope\u2019s expression darkened.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, point me to them and I\u2019ll throw their asses in jail,\u201d Stephen smirked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, that would be easy if they were in this dimension.\u201d Hope grinned and was about to answer when Tony groaned and got up rubbing his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously? Not that I\u2019m particularly against the idea but what dimension exactly are they in?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Dark Dimension,\u201d Stephen answered taking a long sip from his tea. Tony\u2019s eyes widened.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCouldn\u2019t they die in there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo actually, they\u2019re shielded.\u201d Stephen wasn\u2019t looking too happy about that fact. \u201cThey should be happy they aren\u2019t in the Nightmare Realm.\u201d Tony sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, we have to bring them back.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Hope smiled, \u201cThen they can be put in jail.\u201d Tony rolled his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs satisfying as that sounds, we can\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy not? there\u2019s plenty of evidence against them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know it\u2019s just, We could use them against Thanos.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNone of them would be able to scratch someone who is the strength of them all combined.\u201d Stephen argued, \u201cThe only one who could be of any use is the witch who will </span>\n<em>\n<span>never </span>\n</em>\n<span>follow any orders.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStephen,\u201d Tony sighed taking his hands. \u201cThanos is bigger than the issues that the Avengers are having. He will kill us all if we don\u2019t stop him and I don\u2019t want to lose you or frankly the universe for that matter. Even if it means working with them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo until Thanos comes Rogers and his band of assholes get to hurt you left and right.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust\u2026\u201d Tony grimaced. \u201cWe can give them one last chance and if they dial down the assholeness then we don\u2019t arrest them.\u201d Stephen stared at him incredulously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are far too forgiving for your own good,\u201d Hope muttered. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery true.\u201d Agreed Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on Stephen, at the very least we can throw them at Thanos\u2019s army when the time comes.\u201d Tony pleaded. Stephen sighed in defeat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine, but if they even look at you funny, nightmare realm here we come.\u201d Tony rolled his eyes a ghost of a smile on his mouth. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m liking this protective boyfriend thing, it\u2019s very hot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it is what you signed up for.\u201d Stephen grinned pulling Tony closer. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe protectiveness or the hotness?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm\u2026 What do you think?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t really decide\u2026 one of them is clouding my decision.\u201d Tony leaned in so his and Stephen\u2019s noses were a centimetre apart. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhich one would that be?\u201d Stephen almost whispered. Tony grinned closing the distance between them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Right\u2026\u201d sighed Hope. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave you to it then.\u201d Smirking, she turned and headed in the direction of her room. \u201cWhy I\u2019m the one you always decide to make out around I\u2019ll never know. But make sure you send the Rogues back at some point!\u201d She called over her shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Scott screeched and jumped up on a chair in a ridiculous fighting stance as a portal opened above him. He relaxed as he saw Steve, Wanda, Clint, and Sam fall out of it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere have you been,\u201d Natasha asked sounding bored as she turned the page of some Russian book she was reading.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am going to fucking murder that wizard.\u201d Hissed Clint through gritted teeth. He was shaking slightly and still looked frightened from his little interdimensional trip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow\u2019d you piss him off this time?\u201d Scott questioned getting down from his chair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s just it!\u201d Sam exclaimed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were just speaking to Stark when he shows up and goes all crazy on us,\u201d Wanda growled flexing her glowing fingers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd he sent us to that place\u2026\u201d Steve shivered. \u201cThere was some messed up stuff in there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow exactly were you speaking to Tony?\u201d Natasha asked eyeing them over her book.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Steve muttered collapsing into a chair opposite her, still shaking slightly. Then Rhodey and Carol stormed in. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking.\u201d Rhodey practically yelled at them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t corner a teammate and use your power\u2019s unwillingly on them,\u201d Carol said, looking more professional than Rhodey and yet still furious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe just wanted to talk to Stark,\u201d Wanda argued. Rhodey glared at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. This is the part where you shut it! No stupid ass excuses. No piling the blame on Tony. We all saw the footage and that is not you </span>\n<em>\n<span>wanting to talk to him</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Or you </span>\n<em>\n<span>asking to speak with him</span>\n</em>\n<span>. That is you blocking his exits, Provoking traumatic memories, and attempting to force your way into his mind!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRhodes, dial it down.\u201d Muttered Carol shooting him a look, Rhodey obeyed and taking several breaths but still glaring bloody murder at them as Carol continued. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat you did was unprofessional, uncalled for, and frankly incredibly rude. It is not permitted in the Avengers Initiative and is the kind of behaviour we are supposed to be fighting not invoking. Because of Tony\u2019s reluctant arguments, yet still, arguments for you to remain, members of the Initiative, you will get one more chance. But no talking to Tony, no contact with Tony unless by his request. If any more behaviour like that occurs. Immediate termination of your positions will occur, removal or restriction of your powers, and possible jail time will occur.\u201d She glared at them again, \u201cDo I make myself clear?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wanda scoffed, \u201cWhat about the Wizard. He attacked us.\u201d Carol took a deep breath. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDr Strange was aiding a teammate that you were assaulting and will not be punished for his defence.\u201d Wanda continued to glare at Carol not saying anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have made your point clear\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>Captain</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d The word said to another seemed dry on Steve\u2019s throat, he coughed and looked down. After a final dirty look, Rhodey and Carol left the room muttering to one another. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Natasha said coolly. \u201cYou went and tried to forcefully talk to him after I specifically told you not to.\u201d Steve winced recalling a conversation Natasha and he had the morning before. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Scott muttered. \u201cHow\u2019d did he react that made it so bad I mean apart from the obvious... bad reasons.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStark froze up,\u201d Sam explained as everyone threw themselves onto the couch. \u201cLike wide eyes, deer in headlights froze up. Looked a damn sight near terrified.\u201d Natasha was glad to hear regret in at least </span>\n<em>\n<span>one </span>\n</em>\n<span>of their voices.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd who specifically made him terrified?\u201d Scott asked sounding worried and curious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was me I guess\u2026\u201d Steve muttered, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. He was just overreacting when I put my hand on his shoulder.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh really.\u201d Natasha\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cWell Steve, judging by Tony\u2019s seemingly extreme reaction, it\u2019s about time you told the truth about Siberia.\u201d Steve blinked, avoiding her eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI told you. We went to find the soldiers. Tony showed up, Zemo pitted us against one another and we fought. I disabled Tony\u2019s suit and me and Bucky escaped.\u201d There was a silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe </span>\n<em>\n<span>whole </span>\n</em>\n<span>truth Rogers.\u201d Natasha snapped. Steve looked at her oddly for the halt in using his first name.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is the truth.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh really. Well, tell me how Zemo pitted you and Tony against one another.\u201d Steve didn\u2019t answer and soon enough everyone was looking at him expectantly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe showed Tony the video of the Winter Soldier killing his parents.\u201d Steve finally muttered. More silence followed these words, everyone looked horrified except for Natasha who looked furious. Even Wanda had trouble holding back her shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you hadn\u2019t told him.\u201d Natasha practically snarled. Steve avoided her eyes. \u201cYou idiot! You said you would. That you would handle it and I could trust you.\u201d Steve still isn't looking at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI had to protect Bucky Nat, Tony was going to kill him!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018If I could correct that Mr Rogers.\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY\u2019s voice was surprisingly cold, </span>\n<b>\u2018Boss was barely using any of his attacks against you and had no intent to kill. Unlike some people.\u2019</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve flinched slightly at the last words. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony was going to be okay, I didn\u2019t hurt him. I just disabled the suit with my shield.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Scott asked confused, \u201cHow?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I destroyed the Arc Reactor.\u201d At these words, Natasha seemed to get even angrier.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou smashed in his chest with a </span>\n<em>\n<span>vibranium </span>\n</em>\n<span>shield then.\u201d She hissed. The reality of that statement made Steve looked a bit guiltier.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYikes man.\u201d Sam gaped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI second that statement,\u201d added Scott.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI had to protect Bucky.\u201d repeated Steve, \u201cIf he was captured they would jail him for life! He doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd Tony deserved what he got?\u201d Natasha retorted, then glared at Wanda as she looked like she was going to say he did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBucky is my friend,\u201d muttered Steve. Natasha narrowed her eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell if he is all that matters to you then I guess we\u2019re just working together.\u201d Natasha snapped turning her back on them and leaving the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I second that.\u201d Scott agreed. \u201cStark can be an ass but yeah, he didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d He cautiously followed Natasha out glancing back at them several times while he did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki stared at Stephen for a second. The Main Common Room was empty except for the sorcerer meditating in midair. After Thor had left to Nidavellir in the night without really telling anyone save Heimdall, Loki had decided to get away from the Asgardians and use the opportunity to finally talk to Strange. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loki rose into the air and sat in front of Stephen, imitating his cross-legged posture. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you want Loki,\u201d Stephen asked without opening his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am curious about your amulet,\u201d Loki stated calmly. Stephen opened his eyes, looking at the god,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Loki noted Strange immediately looked defensive.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerely what it is. One magic user to another.\u201d Loki kept eye contact with the Doctor as he spoke. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI believe you know what it is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have my suspicions.\u201d Loki smiled slightly as Stephen sighed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Eye of Agamotto is a powerful relic.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery powerful.\u201d Loki agreed, \u201cOne of the most powerful, dare I say </span>\n<em>\n<span>the</span>\n</em>\n<span> most powerful that there is.\u201d Stephen narrowed his eyes, trying to see if there was a plot in Loki\u2019s mind. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019d argue that it is one of the most powerful.\u201d Stephen finally said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo it is an Infinity Stone.\u201d Loki smiled triumphantly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it would be quite rude to consider Vision a relic but, yes. The Time Stone in fact.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow I wonder is it that you humans managed to get your hands on so many Infinity Stones.\u201d Loki sighed, Stephen snorted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPartly from you, but what I wonder is how you got the Tesseract when Asgard was destroyed.\u201d Loki didn\u2019t say anything, opting to stay silent and narrow his eyes at Stephen who was smirking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCouldn\u2019t let Thanos find it in the ruins,\u201d Loki answered softly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, sure.\u201d Stephen closed his eyes again. \u201cI am trying to meditate if you could leave me be.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Loki smirked, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you aren\u2019t in a dark corner with Stark.\u201d Stephen\u2019s eyes immediately flew open, becoming defensive again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d He asked Loki raised an eyebrow amused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you know exactly what it means. Don\u2019t worry, on Asgard gender preference doesn\u2019t often occur.\u201d Stephen sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay then, I didn\u2019t ask for your opinion but whatever. Changing the subject again, the Tesseract is safe with you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can count on it. Thanos will not be getting the Space Stone from me if I can help it.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood.\u201d Stephen closed his eyes again and after watching him for several seconds Loki returned to the ground and left, as he left the room seeming to be distracted by his thoughts, Loki didn\u2019t notice Clint duck out of sight, eyes wide with what he had just heard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clint burst into the East Wing Common Room, which one might notice, was smaller than the West Wing Common Room, he was panting and looking panicked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wanda asked immediately, standing up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou guys, this is bad, super bad.\u201d Clint gasped, gesturing in the direction of the Main Common Room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve pressed urgently.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just heard </span>\n<em>\n<span>Loki </span>\n</em>\n<span>talking to </span>\n<em>\n<span>Strange.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Clint spat both their names with disgust.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd?\u201d Sam asked the only one who hadn\u2019t stood up at his entrance. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLoki has the Tesseract,\u201d Clint said furiously. Steve gaped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt gets worse.\u201d Clint insisted. \u201cThe thing that powers the Tesseract, the Infinity whatever, Strange has one too.\u201d Wanda and Steve stared in horror at Clint, Sam, however, only looked mildly anxious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it should be fine,\u201d Sam said uncertainty lacing his words. \u201cStark wouldn\u2019t let them keep them if they weren\u2019t trustworthy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI doubt Stark would do anything against </span>\n<em>\n<span>Strange.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Clint snarled, \u201cNot when they are all cozying up together.\u201d A beat of silence followed this statement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Steve asked sounding genuinely confused. Clint rolled his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt means that Strange and Stark are together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike together together?\u201d Steve raised an eyebrow barely believing this. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt would make sense.\u201d mused Wanda, her eyes flashing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m still not following,\u201d Steve said, Clint rolled his eyes again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt means they\u2019re fucking Steve.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut-\u201d Steve closed his mouth, then opened it again, then closed it, doing a great expression of a gormless fish. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Out of all the things that Steve had to get accustomed to after waking up from the ice, the concept that men could be with men and ladies could be with ladies, still confused him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe have to do something about this.\u201d Clint was saying as Steve tried to process the information.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, we do.\u201d Steve agreed, thinking about Tony and Strange. \u201cStrange could hurt Tony.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think he meant Loki having the Tesseract Steve.\u201d Wanda sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, why?\u201d Sam asked, unconcerned. \u201cI doubt Loki would try anything. Especially with all the Avengers around.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, he would.\u201d Clint hissed, still fuming. \u201cWe need to get it away from him, and Strange too if he has another similar thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d Wanda nodded, \u201cHe didn\u2019t hesitate to throw us in that place, without any provocation even!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony probably doesn\u2019t know about Strange having an item that could be as dangerous as the Tesseract. If he did I doubt he\u2019d trust Strange\u201d Steve said attempting to convince himself. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah sorry, man.\u201d Sam sighed, finally standing up. \u201cI\u2019ve stood behind you for ages, but going up against two of the most powerful people in the Avengers? Maybe even all the Avengers again?! You guys are nuts.\u201d He shook his head disbelievingly. \u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d He strode out, still shaking his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHonestly.\u201d Wanda scoffed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe don\u2019t need him.\u201d Clint waved off, \u201cRight now we need to figure out a plan.\u201d Steve blinked, staring at the door Sam had left through. His friends were just abandoning him left and right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe should gather more information,\u201d Steve ordered. \u201cMake sure they actually have the Tesseract and whatever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlso,\u201d Clint flicked his eyes upwards. \u201cWe should actually make a plan later.\u201d Steve nodded, understanding that FRIDAY could hear all their words. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s meet after the meeting later today,\u201d Wanda suggested. Steve nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs Tony still in bed?\u201d Bruce asked looking around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Stephen furrowed his brow, \u201cI\u2019ve been at the Sanctum and haven\u2019t heard from him since last night.\u201d Bruce nodded vaguely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, he\u2019s going to miss the meeting if he doesn\u2019t get up soon,\u201d Carol said from the couch where she and Rhodey were watching the news.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe probably isn\u2019t asleep.\u201d Rhodey snorted, he was seated next to Carol, an arm around her. \u201cTony sleeping willingly is not commonly heard of.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm.\u201d Stephen gazed at the hall to the bedrooms, looking concerned. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018It is 14:10.\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY informed them. Rhodey sighed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLooks like we have to go set up the meeting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I come?\u201d Bruce asked, \u201cI don\u2019t really have, well anything, to do.\u201d Carol nodded smiling. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure. Stephen? Can you make sure Tony doesn\u2019t miss the meeting?\u201d Stephen nodded starting to head towards the bedrooms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Stephen could hear Rhodey, Carol, and Bruce talking as they headed towards the meeting room. He walked to the door to Tony (and maybe sometimes his) room. Carefully, he opened the door. The room would be completely dark lacking the blow glow from the Arc Reactor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony?\u201d Stephen asked softly, leaving the door slightly ajar as he moved towards the man lying on the bed. Tony made a noise halfway between a groan and a whimper in reply. Sitting on the bed, Stephen could now see that Tony was covered in a sheen of sweat and was shaking uncontrollably. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony?\u201d Stephen repeated, worry filling his tone as he gently rested a hand on the man\u2019s skin. Tony groaned again, rolling towards Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUrgh.\u201d He groaned. Tony hands were rubbing the Arc Reactor furiously. But he was obviously awake. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Understanding immediately, Stephen opened the nearby box of pills and in the dim light attempted to read the boxes, looking for the box of medication. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony muttered, voice tense and hoarse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have to.\u201d Stephen breathed, still rummaging through the packed box. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to take-\u201d His voice cut off with a severe wince, his hands pressing more firmly on the Arc Reactor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA 10?\u201d Stephen asked softly, hesitating over the box. Tony chuckled dryly, wincing again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTry 20, or 50,\u201d he hissed, squeezing his chest. \u201cOr 1-fucking-thousand.\u201d He groaned, \u201cFri? Why\u2019s it so hot in here?\u201d The room instantly cooled a few degrees.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll go tell Carol we\u2019re skipping the meeting,\u201d Stephen said, stroking Tony\u2019s hair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony winced, \u201cYou go. I\u2019ll-\u201d He breathed in sharply, wincing again. \u201cBe fine.\u201d Stephen snorted quietly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen I\u2019ll drag myself to the meeting and we\u2019ll both look stupid.\u201d Stephen glared at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAt least take your pills.\u201d He said firmly, placing the right dosage on the bedside table. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOnce I can actually breathe properly.\u201d Tony agreed, panting slightly. Stephen paused, before standing and quietly closing the door. He began to head back to the kitchen, still troubled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Stephen knew that Tony had more trouble with pain than him, the chronic pain mixing in with the phantom pain, causing a pain-a-palooza. He had said once that it was like being back in a desert with terrorists tearing up his chest all over again but only </span>\n<em>\n<span>slightly</span>\n</em>\n<span> muted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCrap,\u201d Stephen muttered to himself as he opened the small freezer in the common room and taking out an ice pack Tony had specially bought for this purpose. He headed back to the room, quietly opening the door again and moving to the bed, wrapping the pack in a tea towel as he did so. He gently eased it into the hand Tony had on his chest. Tony sighed slightly in relief. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in 20 minutes to check on you,\u201d Stephen promised, kissing Tony\u2019s forehead comfortingly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlways the Doctor,\u201d Tony whispered, clutching the pack to the skin around the Arc Reactor. Stephen\u2019s lip twitched, and after several seconds, he reluctantly got up. Looking back sadly as he closed the door, Stephen sighed. Turning away from the now closed door, Stephen glanced at his Cloak who had floated towards the room seeming unnaturally concerned. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you watch him?\u201d Stephen asked, the Cloak ruffled in response before floating towards the door in an apparent yes. \u201cThank you,\u201d Stephen whispered, running his shaking hand down the red fabric before heading towards the meeting room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everyone but Thor, Tony, and Strange are in the meeting room and Steve is getting restless. His eyes keep on moving to Loki, who has the Tesseract, the thing that has haunted him throughout the years. Carol and Rhodes are muttering together and Natasha, Scott, and even Sam, are sitting deliberately far from the Steve and the others. Finally the door opens and Strange walks in. He completely ignores Steve and the others, sitting in one of the two empty seats near the front of the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony?\u201d Steve hears Rhodey ask softly. Strange shakes his head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony\u2019s\u2026 not feeling well, he\u2019s still in bed.\u201d Steve feels a twinge of something that feels in between confusion and disgust at the implication that Strange has been in Tony\u2019s room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo he gets to skip the meeting,\u201d Clint said sounding mildly irritated. Strange and the others ignore the question continuing to discuss in even quieter voices. Steve notices that Strange isn\u2019t wearing gloves like he normally does. He, along with several others in the room begin to stare at Strange\u2019s hands. The thick white scars that almost seem like a line tracing his bones are obvious in the bright light of the room and Steve notices that they are shaking obviously. Apparently feeling their eyes on him Strange casually moves his hands off the table and into his lap. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Carol began, standing. \u201cSince Thor isn\u2019t coming apparently, we will just go ahead and start the meeting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre the children at school?\u201d Vision asked in his usual calm voice. Steve guessed he knew what happened considering he hadn\u2019t even acknowledged their presence in the room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, they know most of this stuff already though so it is okay.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd Thor?\u201d Natasha questioned As if he had just been summoned the door opened and Thor strode in. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He cried joyfully, \u201cI haven\u2019t missed the meeting!\u201d There was a shocked silence in which Loki had stood up and moved towards Thor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the hel happened.\u201d He hissed, Steve reluctantly had to admit that there was worry in Loki\u2019s voice. For good reason too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy does it look like you were roasted,\u201d Brunnhilde asked casually, but obvious concern was on her face. That, Steve thought, was a reasonable description. Thor\u2019s skin was dirty, scabbed, and red with burns, but despite the mildly gruesome appearance, he was joyful.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook, brother, I have acquired a new weapon!\u201d Thor lifted a heavy looking axe off his back. \u201cStormbreaker is more powerful than Mjolnir and can even summon the Bifrost!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cImpressive, but what happened that got you, as Brunnhilde rightly put it, roasted.\u201d Loki snapped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh this is nothing, it\u2019s just from taking on the force of Nidavellir.\u201d There was a silence in which no one but the Asgardians seemed to understand something. Loki was staring unamused at Thor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow exactly does one take on the force of a star?\u201d he questioned irritated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPainfully.\u201d Thor smiled, clapping Loki on the shoulder and moving to his seat. Loki sighed, sitting back down next to Thor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Carol said slowly. \u201cWell, Thor, if you wish you can go to the med bay otherwise we should get started with the meeting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course Lady Danvers.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Carol sighed, \u201cBasically, we need to inform you of a threat on the horizon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho?\u201d Scott asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanos.\u201d Strange informed. \u201cHe is the biggest threat any of us ever have, or ever could face.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s he want?\u201d Hope prompted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Infinity Stones.\u201d Strange stated with disturbing calmness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe what nows?\u201d Scott mumbled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Infinity Stones are six elemental crystals of immense power.\u201d He raised his shaking hands and three glowing rocks appeared in the air, surrounded by glittering stars. \u201cEach containing an essential aspect of the universe. Reality, Power, Soul,\u201d with each word the appropriate crystal in the air glowed. \u201cMind.\u201d Strange indicated Vision\u2019s forehead, \u201cSpace.\u201d He glared at Loki for a second who sighed and raised his hand. The Tesseract formed in it and Thor shot a glare at Loki. The original Avengers were all staring at the cube with hatred. \u201cAnd Time.\u201d Strange stood and made a hand motion, opening the iris of the amulet around his neck to reveal a glowing green stone. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanos basically wants them to destroy half the universe,\u201d Brunnhilde said still speaking annoyingly casually. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s a very simplified, blunt, way of putting it,\u201d Loki responded coolly, making the Tesseract disappear again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Brunnhilde huffed sarcastically, \u201cThanos wants them to bring balance to the universe by destroying half of all life.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes that mean ants too?\u201d Scott asked suddenly. Hope stared disbelievingly at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that seriously what you\u2019re asking right now?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Scott cried helplessly, raising his arms in bewilderment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd we can trust Loki with an Infinity Stone?\u201d Steve asked attempting to sound concerned and not confrontational. Which apparently failed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d Loki snapped. Clint snorted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI understand your misgivings,\u201d Thor said calmly, running a finger along the edge of the axe. \u201cLoki is one of the more qualified people to protect the Tesseract.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEspecially with the trying to kill us with it.\u201d Clint hissed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause shooting an arrow at Thanos will definitely keep the stone from him.\u201d Strange sighed, glancing at the clock. Clint glared at the man. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThough I must say, you are taking the new of Loki having one of the Infinity stones much better than I expected.\u201d Strange mused, looking directly at Clint who glared defiantly back. </span>\n<em>\n<span>He knows you listened in. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Obviously, Clint didn\u2019t hear Steve\u2019s mental warning and he continued to glare at the Sorcerer. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is quite a good point.\u201d Loki agreed, eyeing Clint. \u201cI expected several measly death threats at least.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you stop pondering your wish for death threats and focus?\u201d Rhodes raised an eyebrow. \u201cWe still have things to discuss.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to find a way to remove Vision\u2019s stone though.\u201d Wanda murmured, concern in her voice. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould that work? Removing the stone?\u201d Vision asked Bruce. Bruce fiddled with his glasses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt should. If there is a way to remove it you shouldn\u2019t be harmed. The mind stone makes up only part of you, there\u2019s also parts of me, of Tony, of ULTRON and JARVIS. There should be enough of you remaining to still\u2026 well\u2026 be you.\u201d Vision nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow will you remove it?\u201d Natasha questioned leaning forward on the table. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony has a meeting with Princess Shuri sometime soon.\u201d Strange supplied glancing at the clock again a worried expression on his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey\u2019ll have a plan within the first 2 seconds of speaking.\u201d Rhodes smiled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpeaking of plans, we need one.\u201d Carol began. \u201cWe need to decide if we are going to protect, destroy, or hide the Infinity Stones.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOr something else,\u201d added Rhodes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDestroy them obviously.\u201d Brunnhilde pointed out. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to get them at all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOr just some of them.\u201d Loki continued.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike the Mind and Space stone.\u201d Strange added, Loki glared at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd not the Time Stone? Seems like that is the most important one to destroy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGenerations upon generations of Sorcerers have protected the Eye of Agamotto. That is my job, not destroying it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather die?\u201d Loki snapped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf even one of the Infinity Stones is destroyed then Thanos can\u2019t wipe out half the universe If anything happens to the Eye of Agamotto that is a decision made by the Sorcerer's not the Avengers.\u201d Strange replied curtly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd your not an Avenger?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am both a Sorcerer and an Avenger.\u201d Strange responded glaring at Loki.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen where will it stay?\u201d Loki raised an eyebrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAt the New York Sanctum.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, the horrendous place on Bleeker Street.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t find it horrendous.\u201d Thor butted in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEspecially after you smashed half the glass there.\u201d Loki snapped. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re just irritated about the falling thing.\u201d Strange sighed. Loki opened his mouth furiously but was cut off by Carol.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe decision on the destruction of the Time Stone will be left to the Sorcerers,\u201d Carol confirmed. \u201cThe other Stones in out possession, however, will be destroyed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is probably for the best.\u201dVision agreed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have means of destroying the stones.\u201d Strange offered still glaring at Loki.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Rhodey smiled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to destroy them all at once though as it\u2019s much safer that way.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen we wait for the Mind Stone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, that was a relatively simple plan,\u201d Scott mumbled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOnce we make sure the Stones are destroyed we will confirm a plan against Thanos,\u201d Carol said, ruffling through some notes in front of her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony and I have been making plans.\u201d Strange seemed to say more to himself. He glanced at the clock again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss training for today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBasically, we need to make sure that the teams can actually work together and follow orders.\u201d Steve sighed slightly considering the last words Rhodey had pointedly directed at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe have a simple exc-\u201d Carol\u2019s words were cut off by FRIDAY.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Dr Strange, Boss requires your assistance.\u2019 </b>\n<span>As soon as she had finished speaking Strange was already leaving the room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs it urgent FRIDAY?\u201d Rhodes asked sounding worried.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Not anything horribly bad, just the usual bad.\u2019</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow comforting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018That isn\u2019t a strong point in my programming.\u2019</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, Tony did create you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay then.\u201d Carol continued. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At the end of the explanation, the basic training plan was laid out. They had to enter a simulation in which they would infiltrate and retrieve the objective. Seemed fairly simple to Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Almost half an hour later Stephen was quietly closing the door to Tony\u2019s room. Passing the kitchen he dropped the ice pack in the sink and continued down to training. Thankfully Tony had been able to take the medication and was now drifting off to sleep in an attempt to sleep away the pain. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can stay or join me,\u201d Stephen told the cloak who had hovered up next to him. After a couple of seconds of Stephen looking expectantly at it, the cloak hovered back to the door of Tony\u2019s room. Stephen couldn\u2019t help but smile at it. Continuing back downstairs Stephen\u2019s mind began to wander. He stopped outside the door of the Training room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo Loki.\u201d He began. \u201cWhat exactly was the point of letting Clint see out conversation?\u201d Loki stepped out of seemingly nowhere, smirking. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReasons.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat reason being just to make them pissed about you having the Tesseract?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMore or less, they were going to find out anyway and this meant they were less likely to attempt to murder me in the meeting.\u201d Stephen glared at him before rolling his eyes and turning back to the door. He heard Loki chuckling behind him as he headed towards Hope who was standing next to an awkward looking Scott and watching several screens that displayed the other team.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2018Tis quite the shitshow.\u201d Hope stated in her most serious voice. \u201cNone of them but Thor are listening to any of Rhodey\u2019s orders half the time, the other half they are doing stupid things or complaining.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs if they could act any more like spoiled children.\u201d Stephen sighed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, they are quite the collection of brats.\u201d She paused. \u201cHow\u2019s Tony going?\u201d Stephen sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe is asleep. And hopefully will be feeling better tomorrow.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh yes, he is making big plans for tomorrow,\u201d Hope smirked at him suggestively. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe is?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh yes, it\u2019s supposed to be a secret though, so I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d She put a finger to her lips. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight tell me there are big plans but don\u2019t tell me what they are. How considerate.\u201d Hope didn\u2019t answer, instead continuing to smirk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once training was over, the New Avengers team had successfully retrieved the objective in half the time it took the Rogues with fewer \u2018casualties\u2019 which was unsurprising considering the only Rogues following any orders were Sam and Natasha.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are actually supposed to follow my orders!\u201d Rhodey growled at the Rogues. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly doing yourself favours by not following them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight,\u201d Clint said clearly trying not to sneer. \u201cWe\u2019ll remember that.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou better. Otherwise, you are no use to the Avengers Initiative.\u201d The Rogues looked offended as Rhodey began to talk to Carol in a low voice. Stephen was barely holding back a smirk. Tony would be sorry that he missed even more humiliation of Rogers and the assholes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They met later outside the compound and as far away as they could without drawing a large amount of attention.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what\u2019s happening?\u201d Wanda asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe need a plan,\u201d Steve stated. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Clint smiled devilishly. \u201cThe Sorcerer said the Time Stone was kept on Bleeker street right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Steve next saw Tony it was the morning of the second day since making their plan. Tony completely ignored him and Clint as he walked Peter and Harley towards the exit. Steve had to admit, he did look like he\u2019d been sick. Tony\u2019s skin was several shades paler than normal and if one looked closely he was shaking slightly. Steve made to say something but Tony and the kids had already left the room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIgnoring us now,\u201d Clint mumbled, fiddling with his glass. Steve didn\u2019t answer, he could tell that Tony was saying something in the other room but they were too far away to make out the words. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Clint jumped to his feet as a portal opened nearby. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are still the Sorcerer Supreme and you\u2019re supposed to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>protecting</span>\n</em>\n<span> the sanctum. Not popping by now and then.\u201d An irritated sounding man spoke from the other side of the portal. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow Wong, I have been doing both.\u201d Strange replied, also ignoring Steve and Clint. \u201cBesides, you are at the Sanctum almost all of the time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, but I won\u2019t be forever. My library is actually at Kamar-taj, and I need to be there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust one more night.\u201d pleaded Strange.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have to stay at the Sanctum and protect the Eye Strange,\u201d Wong answered sternly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can take it with me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, No way Doc,\u201d Tony said returning to the room. \u201cYou are not taking that damned amulet to dinner, it will completely and utterly ruin the mood.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly.\u201d Wong jumped on the opportunity. \u201cSo you should stay at the Sanctum.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony yelped. \u201cNo way. Not happening. Cmon Wong, if Stephen bails then it will ruin the mood even more. You can\u2019t have a date with only one person!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve grimaced at that, Tony ignored him even though he obviously had noticed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly,\u201d Strange grinned. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to ruin our night would you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh and what about my night?\u201d Wong retorted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat were your plans? Reading a book and listening to Beyonce? You can do that in New York.\u201d Wong glared at him before sighing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are incredibly infuriating Strange. Fine. One more night while you and Tony do whatever it is you do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell.\u201d Tony began grinning. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat does not mean I want to know.\u201d Wong interrupted quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHang on, why am I Strange and Tony, well, Tony?\u201d Wong smirked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt depends how annoyed I am with you.\u201d Strange rolled his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGee thanks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cActually though, thank you.\u201d Tony smiled at the man, Wong sighed again and then stepped back through the portal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI expect you back by midday at the latest Stephen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, mum.\u201d Strange turned back to Tony as the portal closed and they began to head towards the West Wing together. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s useful,\u201d commented Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou do realise that with Wong returning to Kamar-Taj that I will have to stay there and only visit the Compound.\u201d The implication made was clear in his voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, then I guess I\u2019ll have to change my sleeping arrangements,\u201d Tony smirked at the man, raising his eyebrows suggestively. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell as the protector of the New York Sanctum I do get a private room.\u201d Strange replied calmly. Tony grinned at the clear offer and Steve grimaced again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Boss you have a meeting with Ms Potts in 15 minutes.\u2019</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh shit.\u201d Tony grimaced. \u201cPepper will kill me if I\u2019m late.\u201d He turned and began to head to the balcony. Strange watched amused as the suit began to melt around Tony. \u201cJust I\u2019ll send you a location. Meet me at 6?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is oddly early. I\u2019ll see you then I guess.\u201d Tony gave a final wave and then flew off. \u00a0At his exit, Strange\u2019s eyes fell on Steve and Clint still seated. His smile fell replaced by a calm, yet dark, look. Without a word, he continued into the West Wing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIdiots.\u201d Clint scoffed rolling his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe should talk to Wanda.\u201d Steve finally said shaking his head slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s tonight.\u201d Clint nodded understanding with a grim look on his face. He and Steve stood up and began to move towards the training room where they knew Wanda was practising. On the way down as they passed a door, they heard Loki and Thor\u2019s voices. Clint quickly motioned for Steve to stop and they paused by the doorway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is supposed to help your diplomatic skills brother.\u201d Thor was insisting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy diplomatic skills are fine.\u201d Loki hissed back, someone snorted at that and there was a silence in which they could almost picture Loki glaring at someone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe need to go to Xandar and check their protection of the Power Stone.\u201d Thor reasoned, Loki scoffed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo obviously you send me to check the defence of it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe did try to steal one on several occasions.\u201d They heard Brunnhilde comment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure how I should be taking that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen Brunnhilde can\u00a0accompany you,\u201d Thor suggested with a smile in his voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI do need to opportunity to buy stronger alcohol\u2026\u201d Brunnhilde mused Steve wrinkled his nose in disgust. He didn\u2019t really like Brunnhilde. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee,\u201d Thor said. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI hate you.\u201d Sighed Loki. \u201cFine. I will go on your little mission.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcellent.\u201d boomed Thor. There was a silence and too late Steve realised that footsteps were coming towards them. The door swung open and Steve attempted to look natural.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpying are we?\u201d Loki said coldly. Clint sneered at him in distaste.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were just going to the training room.\u201d Loki rolled his eyes in disbelief and Thor was looking hesitant. Steve smiled at him kindly before Clint motioned for him to keep moving. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once out of earshot Steve whispered to Clint.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOne less Sorcerer on our tail.\u201d Clint smiled wickedly but didn\u2019t respond. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At 5:30 pm they headed out. While leaving Clint talked loudly about various Pizza places they could try. He continued to do this while in the car all the way to New York. Once they had almost gotten a block away from the car, Clint leading them down the least crowded streets to avoid attention. They began to discuss the plan.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are we going to do about the Sorcerer guarding the Sanctum?\u201d Clint asked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on my magic since that first training session.\u201d Wanda grimaced at the memory of the quick defeat. \u201cI might be able to disable him if he isn\u2019t as strong as Strange.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell Strange is the Sorcerer Supreme,\u201d Steve began, \u201cI\u2019m assuming that isn\u2019t just to inflate his ego.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI could try and find the stone while you distract the wizard,\u201d Clint suggested. Steve nodded. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat should work\u2026 It would also minimize the time we spend in there.\u201d They continued in silence as they entered the more crowded Bleecker Street. They were all wearing hats and sunglasses as foolproof disguises. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe all have burner phones so let\u2019s go up and down the street and contact one another if we find a wizardy looking place,\u201d Steve suggested. Clint and Wanda nodded, Steve began to walk right with Wanda while Clint walked left.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Almost half an hour later Steve\u2019s phone rang. He quickly flipped it open.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnything?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI found a place, looks pretty wizardy to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat address?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c177a.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d He motioned to Wanda and they took off at a fast walk in the direction Clint went.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Clint asked flicking his head towards the building. It was large with lots of windows and a green roof. The most unusual thing about it was a large circular window on the roof that was made of an odd symbol that reminded Steve of a basketball.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis place is magical.\u201d Wanda murmured flexing her hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShall we go in then?\u201d Clint questioned, looking at Steve. Steve gulped and nodded. Wanda discreetly waved her hand in the direction of the door. There was a soft click and they entered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The landing was empty with a large staircase leading to some other place. They looked around for a second before a voice echoed in the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is your business here?\u201d At the voice Steve started, looking up to see the man, Wong, at the top of the stairs a stern expression on his face. Clint glanced at Cap who shook his arms a bit to release the Wakandan shields on his wrists. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI repeat.\u201d Wong sharply jerked his hands, two shields appearing, on either hand, made of what looked like pure energy. \u201cWhat is your business here, Rogues.\u201d Steve jerked his head at the nickname as if trying to ward off a fly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re here to take something, that frankly, isn\u2019t safe in your hands.\u201d Clint snapped. Wong\u2019s eyes narrowed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend that.\u201d His voice was soft yet menacing. All of a sudden the fight had begun. Steve snapped his wrists, bringing out the rest of his shields and raising them to block a sudden hit by Wong. He attempted to kick out the man's legs but was flung off his feet by a harsh force. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve.\u201d Wanda cried moving her arms in a precise motion so the staircase bannister broke off with a loud crack and began to pelt itself at Wong. A portal appeared and managed to catch most of the staircase, flinging it into a horribly dark looking place. Steve ran forward making a swipe with a shield that Wong dodged, before swiping with the other shield in the direction the man had gone. It bashed into him sending him back into the air. Wong crashed into a large metal cauldron, knocking it over with another loud crash. Steve saw out of the corner of his eye that Clint had disappeared, clearly looking for the amulet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Steve said with a mournful tone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd yet that seems to be your aim,\u201d Wong growled jumping back up and using a portal to bring the fallen staircase rubble down on their heads. Temporarily distracted by his worry for Wanda, Steve didn\u2019t see the energy whip come slashing down at him. Steve felt a burning sensation in his arm as he staggered back, the second attack crashed on him but, ready this time, it banged into his shield.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMove!\u201d Wanda ordered, sending Steve out of the way with a blast of red magic. She threw her hands on the ground and the ground cracked, sending a wave of stone floor towards Wong who quickly formed an energy shield to protect himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn\u2019t strong enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man was covered in a layer of floor and Steve stood up, looking at a cold faced Wanda, staring at the pile of rubble.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs he down?\u201d Steve asked her, moving towards the pile. All of a sudden the pile began to crumble inwards and a portal appeared above them, Wong landed in front of them, face cut and bruising, but he stood up easily, a look of defiance on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They began to fight again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clint jumped through a gap in the staircase bannister, ignoring the fighting below, after a quick inspection, the upstairs didn\u2019t have the amulet only a whole lot of freaky looking wizard stuff. Landing in a crouch, Clint ran down a hallway located behind the large staircase. He had his bow drawn and loaded with shock and stun arrows. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit,\u201d Clint muttered, slowing slightly as he reached a large door. Pushing on it he found it was locked. \u201cAlright then, extreme shit.\u201d He sighed and rummaged in his quiver pulling out three of the few explosive arrows he had brought. Loading them all at once he moved back a safe distance. Eyeing the door, he pulled the bow taught and aimed for the handle, where the lock presumably was. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d He breathed as he let the arrows fly. Clint ducked to the floor as a large explosion shook the vicinity. Looking up he saw a smallish gap in the door. Big enough to shoot through in the least. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Going up the door he smiled as he saw the eye-shaped amulet resting on a plinth. He loaded a grappling arrow and aimed through the hole at the amulet. The arrow hit the mark, as it always did, and attached to the amulet. With a harsh pull, the amulet broke free from the stand and Clint\u2019s eyes widened as he heard voices, a lot of them coming from one of the door\u2019s he could see in the other room. He quickly pulled up the eye, taking it off the end of the grappling arrow and running back to the landing, storing the surprisingly heavy amulet away. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGuys, we gotta go!\u201d He yelled, skidding into the wreckage of the fight. \u201cThere are more wizards. A lot more.\u201d His eyes widened again at an unconscious Wanda on the ground next to an also unconscious Wong. There was a worrying hole in the wall above them and Steve was kneeling next to the girl. A cut bleeding on his face and dark patches on his clothes where attacks had somehow made it through his armour concealed by a dark hoodie. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d murmured Steve, heaving Wanda into his arms and turning back to Clint. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d the voices from the hallway were getting louder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit!\u201d Clint swore again as they ran towards the door. They burst through and began to run down the street, ignoring the stares from the few people on Bleecker Street as they ran.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThose stupid fucking idiots!\u201d snarled Stephen pacing the room. After the news of what had happened reached them the Avengers had gathered in the meeting room to make a plan. Stephen was still frighteningly angry and had been cursing the Rogues for almost five minutes straight. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe know they are idiots Stephen, but right now we need a plan to get back the stone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have been able to happen.\u201d He growled to himself. \u201cThere were a million enchantments protecting it, what happened is impossible.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Rhodey impatiently. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt should\u2019ve been impossible for them to even touch the Eye of Agamotto, or even break into the Sanctum. The Witch isn\u2019t powerful enough to break any of my enchantments. Let alone the thousands put on the Sanctum by generations of Sorcerers.\u201d Stephen resumed his pacing. Tony was watching him with his eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you think they had help?\u201d Tony suggested softly. Stephen nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat would be the only way they could\u2019ve done anything to the Sanctum or Amulet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silence followed the statement. Everyone was sending worried looks at each other about not only the Stone but also the angry Sorcerer who normally wouldn\u2019t lose his calm. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, this is tense,\u201d Brunnhilde announced as she and Loki entered the room. \u201cWhat the hell happened.\u201d Stephen ignored her, instead turning his cold gaze on an unfazed Loki.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did you do,\u201d Stephen said to him in a voice so cold Tony shivered. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cQuite a lot of things. I believe you\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d Loki drawled staring down the Sorcerer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Time Stone,\u201d Stephen answered abruptly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat makes you think I did anything?\u201d Loki raised an eyebrow seeming slightly amused. Stephen strode up to him until they were facing one another. Barely a foot between them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are the only Magic user powerful enough to have done anything, and you knew about the stone.\u201d Loki didn\u2019t blink, instead, a flash of disappointment went across his face for a millisecond. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was a simple test of trust.\u201d At Loki\u2019s words, Stephen looked ready to murder the god. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStephen\u2026\u201d warned Carol preparing to jump in if the situation escalated. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTrust,\u201d Stephen whispered disbelievingly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess they failed then.\u201d Loki glanced around at the tense and angry Avengers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo shit Sherlock.\u201d Tony murmured. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh Brother.\u201d Sighed Thor looking tired. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell what was your plan if they weren\u2019t \u2018trustworthy.\u2019\u201d Brunnhilde questioned looking bored. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe go get it back,\u201d Loki stated simply. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhich can\u2019t happen because you removed all the enchantments.\u201d Stephen pointed out still looking angry. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWith the simple tracking spell I cast on it.\u201d continued Loki ignoring Stephen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Carol sighed, \u201cWhere are they then.\u201d Stephen, still looking angry leaned on the wall, glaring daggers at Loki. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHang on.\u201d Loki murmured. He raised his hands and green magic drew a map of New York in the air. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d asked Rhodey looking around the glowing map wearily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, they move fast,\u201d Loki said to himself more than the room. His eyes swept the map and located an orb that glowed brighter than the actual map. \u201cThey are over there.\u201d He nodded towards the orb.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s pull up an image of the place and I\u2019ll teleport there,\u201d Stephen stated looking at the orb himself. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Loki answered simply.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d Stephen challenged.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey\u2019re underground.\u201d Stephen glanced at the orb again frowning. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere are they then?\u201d Rhodey asked confused. \u201cThat\u2019s a fairly busy shopping street and Roger\u2019s is most likely too full of himself to go into a sewer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Loki mused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe could ask Scott.\u201d Hope offered, everyone looked at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow do we know that he\u2019s trustworthy?\u201d pointed out Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe didn\u2019t go with them did he?\u201d Hope said, \u201cAnd he barely talks to them anymore, he told me, and FRIDAY confirmed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Carol nodded, \u201cFRIDAY? Can you call him here?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A minute later a nervous looking Scott entered the room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey guys\u201d He looked around worriedly, hesitating at the clearly angry Sorcerer and other Avengers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cScott,\u201d Hope stood up and went over to him. \u201cDo you know of any underground hideout that the Rogues had while on the run. One in New York, on 86th.\u201d Scott fidgeted, glancing at the glowing map in the air. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI dunno. Natasha always did that stuff.\u201d He muttered Hope held back a sigh. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, then we\u2019re screwed.\u201d Rhodey groaned. \u201cNatasha would warn them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho? Steve and the others?\u201d asked Scott confused. \u201cShe\u2019s really angry with them. Hasn\u2019t talked to them after finding out Steve lied.\u201d Tony grimaced, Steve was really lying to everyone then. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen we can ask her.\u201d Bruce determined. Carol sighed and nodded. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018She\u2019s on her way.\u2019 </b>\n<span>informed FRIDAY.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Scott looked at the map again looking nervous. Hope shook her head. Scott quietened and looked at the door as Natasha entered wearing her usual guarded expression. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d she asked calmly, glancing at the map and the angry expressions piecing together the story.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr Rogers, Mr Barton, and Miss Maximoff stole the Time Stone, damaged the Sorcerer\u2019s Sanctum and harmed one of Dr Strange\u2019s friends\u201d Vision answered quietly a look of utter sadness and disappointment on his face. Natasha closed her eyes regaining her calm whereas Scott looked horrified.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey have hidden in one of your hidey holes from when you were wanted terrorists,\u201d Stephen said coldly, although he had sort of calmed down he was still radiating anger. Tony kept on eyeing him with concern, wary of approach as Stephen was likely to snap at even at those closest to him at the moment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll take you there.\u201d Natasha opened her eyes again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow do we know that you are trustworthy?\u201d Stephen accused. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on forgiving Roger\u2019s and anyway, I am not so egotistical to ignore the fact that most everyone in this room could overpower any of the Rogue Avengers or myself. I\u2019ll take you there.\u201d Carol nodded again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe should try to do this without fighting. Although it may be tempting to beat the shit out of them, there are plenty of civilians in that area and we don\u2019t want any casualties.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is going to be simple. I\u2019ll just banish them to the nightmare realm and be done with it.\u201d Stephen said viciously. Carol shook her head quickly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo Stephen. They can be locked away and rot in jail but leave that sort of cruelty to the bad guys.\u201d Stephen sighed but nodded at her point. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDr Strange, Loki, you are both adept at magic and most likely will cause less damage than everyone else here with our lasers, bullets, and energy blasts.\u201d Rhodey stood up and examined the map closer. \u201cWe\u2019ll send you in to apprehend the Rogues, and only apprehend.\u201d He looked sternly at Stephen as he said that. \u201cUse whatever means necessary to arrest them and they will be taken to the government.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHope?\u201d asked Carol, Hope looked at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you and Scott suit up and make sure that Civilians stay away from the fighting? In case things get out of hand.\u201d Hope and Scott nodded, pulling out the small boxes in their pocket\u2019s containing their suits and heading out to suit up. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The final aspects of the plan were made and Natasha began to lead Stephen and Loki away, Tony moved after them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStephen.\u201d At Tony\u2019s voice, Stephen turned and immediately realised what Tony was about to ask. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo way. You are not coming.\u201d The rate that he switched from incredibly angry, I will smite all in my path, Sorcerer to protective boyfriend was rather amusing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy new suit has features that could help,\u201d argued Tony. \u201cEspecially with detaining them.\u201d Stephen shook his head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou also haven\u2019t recovered from yesterday\u2019s flare-up.\u201d Stephen pointed out sternly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMinor detail.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere is also no way I\u2019m letting Roger\u2019s anywhere near you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd what about you? You may be more powerful than him but I was as well yet he still almost killed me, and the Witch is more powerful than she let on at training you could get hurt!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d Stephen embraced the man. \u201cI\u2019ll kick their asses and come back without a scratch.\u201d Tony didn\u2019t answer instead hugging Stephen tighter. \u201cThough I do have to go to do that.\u201d Tony groaned softly and let go of Stephen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou better protect him,\u201d Tony said to the Cloak on Stephen\u2019s shoulders, the Cloak fluttered in the answer. Stephen smiled at Tony and turned back to the waiting Loki (Natasha had gone to suit up). </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Rogues were so in trouble now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d Clint asked Wanda as she began to stir. Wanda groaned in answer putting a hand to her head. Clint helped Wanda up, a comforting arm around her shoulder. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Wanda looked around still slightly out of it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOne of Nat\u2019s hideouts,\u201d Clint answered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat,\u201d Wanda looked at him panic on her face. \u201cShe could sell us out\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah, She may be pissed at us but I trust her.\u201d At Clint\u2019s words, Wanda seemed to calm. She got to her feet unsteadily, Clint helping her all the way. Steve was looking at the amulet they had </span>\n<span>stolen</span>\n<span> retrieved in interest. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow do you think it works?\u201d Wanda walked over to where he was sitting at a table. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know but that is not for us to know, Just like the Tesseract this thing will be dangerous. Wanda nodded but as she looked at the amulet something like greed flickered in her stomach. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d Clint was looking in a mini fridge that occupied the corner of the room. \u201cBy that I just mean water.\u201d he sighed, pulling out a large bottle he handed it to Wanda who drank some before giving it back to Clint who chugged a quarter of the bottle. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Wanda asked eyes still on the amulet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, we have no idea how to destroy this thing so I guess we just keep it away from the others.\u201d Clint nodded in agreement to Steve\u2019s words. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOr at least until they realise that they can trust us and not people like Strange with the stone,\u201d Clint added. Steve nodded. Wanda put her hand on the table, feeling a little dizzy. Steve looked at her in worry. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cC\u2019mon kid, you should lie down for a bit.\u201d Clint put his arm back around Wanda\u2019s shoulder and guided her to one of the small rooms illuminated by a lamp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI hate being underground.\u201d murmured Wanda as she lay down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour parents?\u201d Clint breathed. Wanda nodded, sadness filling her. </span>\n<em>\n<span>It was Stark. </span>\n</em>\n<span>She thought firmly, replacing the sadness with anger towards the man which lasted several seconds before it was replaced this time with tiredness. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next time Wanda opened her eyes, Clint had gone and another voice had joined them underground. Getting up she wandered to the doorway of the room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be here.\u201d Natasha was saying from the door. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell it\u2019s a good place to hide,\u201d answered Clint from the couch he was lounging on. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d asked Steve standing up. Wanda noticed the amulet was on the table. The feeling resembling greed resurfaced. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you seriously steal from the Sorcerer?\u201d asked Natasha in disbelief.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe can\u2019t trust him,\u201d Wanda said immediately she fully entered the room, heading towards the table and taking a seat in what she hoped was a casual movement. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know that.\u201d Natasha sighed. \u201cStealing from them was a bad move though.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening back at the compound?\u201d questioned Clint as Natasha moved into the room and sat on the arm of the couch. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey are completely panicked.\u201d Natasha smiled slightly. \u201cThey tried to get me to tell them where you were but I said I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey believed you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can make anyone believe anything.\u201d At those last words, another feeling began to drown out the greed. Wanda couldn\u2019t name it though. Clint snorted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIdiots.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan now?\u201d asked Natasha calmly, her eyes flicking to the Amulet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHide it,\u201d Steve answered, Clint, nodded and shrugged. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Natasha rolled her eyes. \u201cYou are horrible at plans if you don\u2019t even know what is happening now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know how to destroy it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen why did you steal it?\u201d Natasha snapped, standing back up. \u201cYou can\u2019t just hide forever!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Nat.\u201d Steve smiled at her. \u201cWe have been on the run before.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut last time you weren\u2019t being hunted by the other Avengers! Tony knew our exact location half the time but did nothing. Do you think that\u2019s just going to happen again now you\u2019ve stolen something of great value to them?\u201d Steve was quiet for several seconds. Clearly, he had not realised this. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat would you have us do?\u201d asked Wanda waspishly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI would have you give it back to them! You don\u2019t have to turn yourselves in if you just leave it for them to find. Then they probably will stop hunting you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is stupid Nat.\u201d Clint sat up. \u201cWe can\u2019t give it to them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve?\u201d Natasha pleaded with him. Wanda snapped her gaze to him expectantly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNat\u2026\u201d Steve sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we can\u2019t trust them with something possessing this kind of power.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut it can be trusted with you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMore so than them. We at least won\u2019t use the power for our own gain. We can protect it without endangering anyone.\u201d Natasha glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was as if someone had flicked a switch. Natasha straightened and her expression of kindness and trust was replaced with a cold indifference.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf that is your final answer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wanda then managed to name the feeling that had drowned out the greed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was dread.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTasha?\u201d asked Clint, standing up and taking a defensive stance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeated, but this time it was sharp and cold. \u201cBut this is bigger than any of us.\u201d Steve opened his shields, looking wary.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he questioned, there was hurt in his voice by this sudden turn of events. Wanda also stood up, shielding the table with the amulet and magic beginning to flow through her fingers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe means you are screwed,\u201d Loki smirked as he entered and took a place beside her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re working with Loki?!\u201d Choked Clint, horror and hurt in his voice. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe is an Avenger,\u201d Natasha said, her eyes softening for a moment at Clint\u2019s expression before seeing Wanda\u2019s protection of the Amulet and they hardened again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA title you don\u2019t have the pleasure of having.\u201d Strange entered and stood on Natasha\u2019s other side. Clint growled, opening his bow, picking up his quiver and drawing an arrow in the span of a second. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s make this simple,\u201d Strange said with a deadly voice. \u201cYou give me back the Eye of Agamotto and this won\u2019t get painful.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said simply raising his shields. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Strange answered coolly, orange magic circling his shaking hands. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou really are horribly stubborn,\u201d Loki commented, jerking his hands out, daggers appearing in them. Wanda grabbed the amulet, putting it around her neck so they couldn\u2019t go up and grab it. Strange\u2019s eyes darkened. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Wanda.\u201d Natasha sighed in disappointment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the android.\u201d Loki smirked at her, \u201cHe was so disappointed in you.\u201d Wanda growled in fury, her insides breaking as she raised her hands, throwing glowing red magic at their opponents.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHope informed me they about to come back,\u201d Carol said to Tony glancing at a screen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnharmed?\u201d Tony asked immediately. Carol frowned. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say.\u201d At Tony\u2019s face, Carol quickly continued. \u201cThat implies that they weren\u2019t, if there was anything serious then she would\u2019ve said.\u201d Tony nodded still uncertain. There was a startled yell from outside the compound. Tony looked towards the open window.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019ll be Stephen\u2019s portal.\u201d He smirked at the sound made by the shocked government officials here to pick up the arrested Rogues. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d Carol smiled and began to walk towards the door. Tony quickly overtook her and went outside. He let out a sigh of relief as he saw the Rogues held down by some of Stephen\u2019s Eldritch magic that quickly turned to a grin at the sight of the Sorcerer himself handing the Eye of Agamotto to a highly irritated Wong. Tony moved up to him and instantly began to babble.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you okay? What happened? And don\u2019t give me that \u2018im fine\u2019 bullshit I can clearly see your bleedin-\u201d he stopped abruptly as in response to his babbling Stephen had kissed him with so much enthusiasm that Tony completely lost track of every thought running through his head (which is quite an achievement.) </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Completely forgetting where they were and how they were surrounded by almost a hundred government officials, several news reporters that had managed to get in, and the Rogue Avengers Tony put his arms around Stephen and answered with an amount of enthusiasm to rival Stephen\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHonestly.\u201d Wong scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ll just go put the Eye in the Sanctum then.\u201d Stephen didn\u2019t answer, not exactly focusing on his friend at the moment. Wong shook his head fondly before opening a portal back to the Sanctum. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Considering Stephen and Tony weren\u2019t exactly showing any sign of stopping their make-out session (the cloak had actually wrapped around both of them, the collar shielding them from the eager and astounded press.) Loki and Natasha had begun to explain what had happened to Carol, Rhodey, and several of the government officials there. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about containing the witch\u2019s powers.\u201d Loki was saying, sounding immensely bored as he balanced a knife on the tip of his finger, gaining cautious looks from almost everyone there. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d asked Carol, glancing at Wanda, who was staring at the floor a shocked, vacant expression on her face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWitch tried something a bit too advanced for her meagre talents,\u201d Loki smirked, letting the knife fall and catching it by the blade. Natasha rolled her eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s a simplified way of putting it.\u201d As she spoke she was dabbing at some blood on her forehead with a damp cloth. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShort version.\u201d Loki straightened, eyeing the officials with a calm expression. \u201cShe tried to use the Time Stone, failed miserably and now no longer has her \u2018powers.\u2019\u201d At this news, Tony and Stephen finally broke apart. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHang on. What?\u201d Tony questioned confused. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, Mr Stark, nice of you to return to reality,\u201d Rhodey smirked, Tony glared at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust some magical mumbo-jumbo without any scientific explanation whatsoever that you won\u2019t understand,\u201d Loki said casually. Tony gave the man an immensely dramatic eye roll. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust explain it, brother,\u201d Thor ordered, appearing next to them. Loki sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d Loki began, \u201cDo you remember when I tried to control your mind before?\u201d At these words, there were several startled cries and Stephen and Rhodey, in particular, looked ready to curse/beat up Loki on the spot. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tony nodded, ignoring the reactions. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\u201cYour Arc Reactor, it was based on the Tesseract?\u201d At Loki\u2019s question, Tony nodded again.</span><span><br>\n</span> <span>\u201cBasically.\u201d A look of understanding graced his features. \u201cThe Arc Reactors similar energy to the Tesseract meant you couldn\u2019t use the Mind Stone. They cancelled each other out basically.\u201d Loki nodded. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe same thing sort of happened when Maximoff tried to use the Time Stone.\u201d Stephen continued for Loki. \u201cAlthough it was a stronger reaction, one might say, as he powers came from the Mind Stone however the Arc Reactor was just based on the Space Stone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what exactly happened then.\u201d Vision murmured softly. Looking at Wanda an unreadable expression on his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHer powers are gone, I double checked and it\u2019s almost as if she didn\u2019t have them in the first place.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe also appears to have Amnesia,\u201d added Loki, still in the same bored voice. \u201cThat\u2019s probably temporary though.\u201d Vision didn\u2019t say anything, his eyes turning away from the girl and focusing back on the conversation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe will make sure that she isn\u2019t given the same treatment as the raft then.\u201d One of the officials said with certainty. Rhodey nodded retaining a respectful mask. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll contact you about the trial.\u201d one of the officials said, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Isn\u2019t he one of the many, many, Ross\u2019s? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Tony thought dully barely listening to the conversation. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you.\u201d Carol smiled politely at them and as all the officials turned around she gave the Rogues the middle finger, somehow she managed to hide it from the press. Roger\u2019s face reddened and he aimed the glare he had been using on Stephen and Tony on her instead. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf that is all.\u201d Tony clapped his hands together, the press clambered forward but Tony gently waved them off, a winning smile on his face. \u201cSorry guys, you\u2019ll have to wait for the press conference after the trial to get answers out of us.\u201d He smirked at Stephen. \u201cEven for questions not related to the arrest.\u201d He bade a final goodbye to the press and turned back to the compound. The grin on his face remained though. He was finally free.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The trial took place a week from the Rogue\u2019s arrest. Tony had forbidden the kids from coming despite the pestering, specifically from Harley, instead giving them the compromise of a flight/swing around New York later. An hour before the trial Tony stood in front of the mirror in his room since he didn\u2019t exactly need his suit today, he was making sure the glow of the Arc Reactor was hidden from sight. Satisfied he buttoned the dark suit jacket over his dark red tie. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Hello, Boss.\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY said cheerfully as he slid some glasses onto his face and the lenses lit up with a mini HUD. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Fri,\u201d Tony answered softly. He sighed and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. Tony smiled as familiar arms wrapped around him from behind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Stephen asked as leaned back into the man\u2019s embrace. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep.\u201d Tony turned to face Stephen and smirked. \u201cWow, you look good in a suit. It\u2019s a nice change from your hobo wizard look.\u201d Stephen scoffed, a slight smile on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that my hobo wizard look is so disappointing.\u201d He answered, calmly straightening Tony\u2019s tie. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you\u2019d look hot in anything don\u2019t worry.\u201d Tony grinned. \u201cOr in nothing for that matter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought we already established I look good in nothing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Tony put his arms around Stephen\u2019s waist smirking. \u201cI might need to check again.\u201d Tony pressed his lips to Stephen\u2019s and sighed in contentment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Boss, sorry to interrupt, but you just got your clothes back on and I doubt the Court would appreciate you being late.\u2019 </b>\n<span>Tony groaned at FRIDAY\u2019s interruption, pulling away from Stephen and doing up the button on his suit jacket. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight you are baby girl. Although you completely ruined the moment.\u201d Tony smiled slightly, he could practically hear FRIDAY sighing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u2018Right I forgot, you and Dr Strange have so few of those.\u2019 </b>\n<span>FRIDAY answered dryly. Stephen\u2019s mouth twitched as he fiddled with his sling ring. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShall we?\u201d he asked gesturing to Stephen\u2019s Sling ring. Stephen nodded, slipping it on and raising his hands to open a portal. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-o-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The entire trial was hilariously humiliating for the arrested Rogues. They got to give their side of the story and Rogers gave his usual rant about how he just wanted to do what was right, about how this was bigger than all of them, and he didn\u2019t want to harm anyone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But then it was the other sides turn. It was quite entertaining albeit depressing to hear Tony relay event after event after event of the Avengers hostile attitude towards him and whatever he did. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With each word, Rogers and the others got paler and paler. Maximoff had been excused from the trial due to her current state (the amnesia) but it was satisfying enough to watch Barton and Rogers steadily become white as sheets. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Tony reached Ultron. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At the news of Wanda Maximoff influence on Tony to create Ultron, the tenseness of the room increased so it was as if no one was making any sound spare Tony. Tony then relayed how she had manipulated all the Avengers, also causing Hulk\u2019s rampage in Johannesburg. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time Tony had reached the subject of Siberia Roger\u2019s looked ready to faint. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHeinrich Zemo revealed to me that the Winter Soldier had actually killed my parents, Howard and Maria Stark, under the orders of Hydra.\u201d At this statement, the silence broke and people began to speak and yell over the news. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen, it was also revealed that Steve Rogers knew this already but neglected to tell anyone.\u201d Tony continued ignoring the outbreak of words, instead just raising his voice. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSince they returned Rogers, Barton, and Maximoff have committed several more acts of assault, mostly towards me, and then they decided to steal an incredibly powerful artifact they had no right to because according to them it was safer in their hands than the Avengers.\u201d Sometime during the long speech Tony\u2019s voice had became detached, he had probably rehearsed this, maybe in his mind for years. A hopeful plea in his mind that something someday would be done about Steve Rogers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They were going away for an incredibly long time, Tony almost cheered but decided to keep some air of professionalism. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was exhausting.\u201d Tony smiled as he and Stephen talked, in the hallway outside the courtroom. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut\u2026 you won.\u201d Stephen reminded him, Tony\u2019s smile widened. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI won.\u201d he closed his eyes and lent his head on Stephen\u2019s shoulder. They stayed there in silence for several minutes, just enjoying each other\u2019s company when.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony?\u201d The horribly recognizable voice pleaded with him and Tony\u2019s eye immediately snapped open. Steve was at the end of the hallway, being led by half a dozen guards who were now having trouble moving the super soldier planted firmly on the ground. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony practically snapped at the man. No fake courtesies anymore. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just, want to fix this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBit late for that,\u201d Tony answered simply.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlso incredibly stupid timing considering you are about to be locked up for most, if not all your life.\u201d Stephen pointed out, putting an arm around Tony protectively. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were friends Tony.\u201d Steve pleaded, \u201cWe are family.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo we aren\u2019t\u201d Tony did snap this time, breaking free from Stephen\u2019s hold to point a finger angrily in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cWe never were family, we weren\u2019t even friends. I was just a doormat to you, you\u2019d walk all over me, manipulate me, and take advantage of my resources. But we were never friends so don\u2019t fucking kid yourself.\u201d Steve stared at him, fake remorse in his eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony be reasonable.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am being reasonable. I am being the most reasonable I\u2019ve been in years. I\u2019m wiping myself clean of you, I don\u2019t ever want to think of you again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t forget me, Tony, you can\u2019t forget the original Avengers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span> \u201cNo, you know what, I will remember the original Avengers, but not the people, not you, but the promise we made. We would protect our world, we would protect the people. No matter the cost. Just putting aside our ego\u2019s and avenging the damn Earth. And in several generations time people won\u2019t remember Captain America or Steve Roger\u2019s, he\u2019ll just be a name in a history book that people flip by because they don\u2019t care about the hero turned terrorist. They won\u2019t even bother to remember you, but god\u2026\u201d Tony grinned, opening his arms wide in triumph, much like he once did on a hot day in the desert back in 2008, on the day Iron Man was born. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey will remember Iron Man. They will remember </span>\n<em>\n<span>Tony fucking Stark</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d </span>\n</p>"
